I’ll meet a girl who I find attractive and can connect with on music, politics, humor, and more and I’ll think to myself how this is actually pretty great. As soon as we get a month in, and knock out more than a handful of dates, it’ll be more than obvious that I’m into them and they’ll leave. Like, is it bad to want to see someone more than once a week to get to know them? Am I scaring them off by wanting to see them or talk to them more often? 

To note, when I do meet someone, I don’t treat them as more than a friend since they aren’t yet. I’m not blowing up their phone to text them, or trying to hang out every night, I have my own life to live, but I feel like showing genuine interest is scaring people away.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rzcl6e/why_is_it_that_people_lose_interest_in_you_as/

We just went to our own countries for the holiday 6 weeks after we started our relationship. He struggled a lot living with his parents during his stay there. He gradually stopped saying i love you. I started complaining about the lack of his attention. He doesn't like texting, audio calls   neither videocalls. I can relate he doesn't feel comfortable talking to me in the place of his parents. Since we are not together physically, indeed I tried compensate his absence with talks or texts. That's why we discussed about it a lot. Just because of some family problems, he wanted to stay alone without telling me any notice. I found his behavior disregard to me and our relationship.

Before the holiday, we decided to have a trial of living together for a short period for after our arrival. That's why I subletted my place for this period. Now he doesn't want to do it. He proposed me to meet 5 days quarantine after my arrival would be better. During his holiday in his parents place, he get a new decision that he doesn't want to share his place with anyone. My subtenant will leave my place 3 days after my arrival. Even though he knows I'm in a bad financial situation, he told me that you should find a solution, like staying in a hotel. Luckily I found a place to stay for those days, I will not go his place. But I just don't know what to do, because I still have feeling for him. I feel so frustrated because I really trusted him.

This was a few weeks ago: on Tuesday we agreed to go on a date on Sunday. On Thursday I talked to her to arrange and she said she needed to talk to her parents first to see at what time they could take care of her son so she could go out with me on Sunday, and she said she would talk to them on Friday. On Saturday afternoon I texted her asking when she would be available on Sunday for the date and she replied a few hours later saying she was busy with her son and she would talk to me right away. That day she didn't talk to me after that. She then changed her Whatsapp profile picture, uploaded a few photos on instagram and at 3 am she uploaded a story on instagram having a beer with a friend, I think they were in her house.

On Sunday, the day of the date, she sent me a message at 3.30 pm telling me that she was very busy and her parents would be back home at night so she couldn't leave her kid with them and then asked me if we could meet when she came back from her vacation.

I didn't reply and we haven't talked since then.

I'm trying to figure out if she's actually into me?","I've been seeing this girl who I've been having a great time with. We share a number of interests and have good chemistry on dates and amazing chemistry physically. We slept together after the first date and again after the second. After the second date I'm starting to grow more attracted to her and want to get to know her better and am interested in our connection beyond just the sex. However, I can't tell if she feels the same way. I feel like I am investing more into it than she is in terms of displaying eagerness to see each other and keep communication going when we're apart via text.

She seems interested in me on our dates, asks me a lot of questions, we laugh a lot, she is attentive, hasn't blown me off, we held hands and kissed more often on the second date, etc. However when I ask what she's doing the next week in order to set up another date she acts very playful and coy saying something like ""hmm I don't knowww"", leaving it to me to initiate everything. Also both times after we've had sex she is quick to leave my apartment, seeming like she's in a rush, and says she has a busy day at work the next day and needs to get home. When we are not together the texting game is pretty odd. She never initiates texts, and doesn't really respond to any flirtations I send over text. She'll respond to my texts pretty quickly if I send a question or if I haven't messaged her in awhile, but a lot of other times she won't respond at all if I send something that is a little random or something light-hearted like a joke (for like days and then I'll message again to break the silence) .

Knowing her profession she is indeed likely really busy during the work week and seems to have a very active social life on weekends. However, the weird texting and her being coy and having me initiate everything has driven me to start to overthink everything and I am wondering constantly if she's actually into me or not. I don't necessarily want to dive into a heavily committed relationship at the first opportunity, but of course if it's someone I really develop feelings for I'm totally open to it. I'm just wondering if I am overthinking this whole situation or if I'm on point with this and should tread carefully... i.e. she sounds like she's just in it for the sex and free drinks.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rzd0xq/went_26_m_on_two_dates_with_a_girl_25_f_we_slept/
8,rzd3lh,1641684075,i just found out the guy I’m talking to was diagnosed as a psychopath,"I just found out the guy I’m seeing was diagnosed as a psychopath at 4 years old

i just found out the guy I’m seeing was diagnosed as a psychopath at 4 years old

so I’m visiting the guy I’m seeings moms house. we go through some old stuff and find a big, thick binder. we open it and it’s full of full length paragraphs and daily notes like a journal. probably 100 pages. i come to notice these pages are documentation paragraphs, and documents concerns of (let’s call him John) John as a child. the papers went on and on. they seemed to be documentation of him at a Psychiatric facility. I keep reading and I see tons of hand written notes by doctors and psychologists. they had numerous quotes stating his violent behavior and actions. he was 4… in preschool. the notes read “we are extremely concerned about johns behavior. he continues to threaten, be violent, and cause problems daily. Our concerns for John are that he violently harms animals, small children, the adults and staff at the daycare.” “John shows absolutely no remorse for his actions, and when in “that mindset”, John will harm others and destroy students work with a big smile on his face”. 

What I’m saying , is that this kid checked off every box for being a psychopath at a very young age. 

I keep searching and i find notes about how he would threaten to kill the other students. One day, he said “I’m going to kill you joe.” And shoved his teacher off a tall loft. There were more notes about how we would purposely and unprovoked hit and shove others to harm them. He was seriously violent and had to be removed from many schools. He was taken to a university hours away to be researched and evaluated. This was all documented…. In a thick binder. I’m freaking out. I confronted him, and he says he’s not like that any more after years of therapy. I have no real clue when it all “ended” and he became normal. He’s never struck me as threatening or dangerous , but this completely changes my mind. The sad part is I know he had a difficult childhood, and this is mostly a reflection of what he grew up around. But i have no indication if it is deeper than that, and he still buries these feelings to this day and hides it. 

Look, i know kids can be scary and weird and it means nothing. But this seems extreme, and i wonder if it affects him today because i don’t think that shit ever goes away. He was kicked out of daycares due to violence, and needed special teachers that could handle him. Help please.


TLDR: so this guy I’m seeing i found out by a file in his moms house that he was evaluated by a mental facility and researched on because he showed every sign of being a psychopath as a child. hurting animals and hurting other kids, violent and angry, non sympathetic and no remorse. it freaked me out I really like him though, it’s hard to know what to do. he clearly isn’t like that anymore",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rzd3lh/i_just_found_out_the_guy_im_talking_to_was/

15,rzdgp1,1641685047,Do I have the moral right to date both guys or should I choose one?," Little pre-story:

I am recently out of long relationships, I was engaged and my sexual life was pretty frustrating, so now I’m kind of experiencing and compensating for that. 

In December I started kind of seeing one guy, we slept pretty fast, continued hanging out and being pretty romantic afterwards. (Going to restaurants, for walks, having more sexual experiences) 
However, we never had “who are we” kind of talk and didn’t promise anything to each other. He also is a very nerdy, IT type of guy, workaholic (even though personality otherwise is sweet and respectful) , so for relationships he definitely doesn’t give me enough attention and that was same problem he had in his previous relationship. I considered him more being a “lover” for me. Then he left to his home country for a month. We never could text well (he just doesn’t know how to do it), all communication was happening live. When he left, we almost never communicated, very dry checking on each other. 


So during his absence another guy asked me out, we had a little pre-story, we were in the same social circle but both in relationships. I went out. On the second date we ended up sleeping with each other. After that day he also had his vacation booked and left the country for a week. During the whole week he was trying to maintain contact and even invited me to join the trip. He came back now, we met and had more dates, one more intercourse. I truly don’t know if we will be a good match as a couple, I’m still looking. We kind of communicating very cheesy romantically, but there never was who are we or exclusivity talk either. 

First guy has returned from his trip though and asking to see me right away. 

If I had been in a talking stage with these guys, I’d totally go on dates with both. But now that I slept with both and kinda maintaining it, it feels wrong. Even though technically I didn’t promise anything to either one and they didn’t ask me also. 

Is it time right now to talk about exclusivity or do I have a moral right to go on a dates and possibly maintain sexual relationships with both?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rzdgp1/do_i_have_the_moral_right_to_date_both_guys_or/

Been talking for a few weeks. Set up the first meetup at a coffee shop. Met up. Convo went well. A lot of small talk and it flowed decently. She asked just a few things about me but wasn't on her phone much if not at all and we were laughing a bit.

The date went for about an hour and she said that she wanted to run out to do a few errands. She said she didn't have much to do after the date and she asked what I was doing for the rest of the day. We didn't establish a second date and I was straightforward and asking if she wanted to meet up for another date. She said something along the lines that she can't decide now as she's thinking about her errands. (Basically, a no.)

It's been awhile since I've been on a date. I'm reading this situation correct right? I shouldn't bother texting afterwards? I was just kinda surprised how short the meet up was and I'm pretty sure if she were interested, she would have answered sure to my question.

Two nights ago we finally exchanged numbers. He is in the military so he just got stationed somewhere is no longer home. He asked me to take a two-hour train ride to visit him so we could go somewhere to hang out. I kind of thought he was joking about it but then we exchanged numbers, played Imessage games, and he brought it up again although nothing was ever planned. We also texted until 6 in the morning and talked about stupid stuff. During this, he snapped me, but I didn’t answer bc we were texting. He even sent me a voice message LOL. It was adorable. We talked about an array of things and then finally said goodnight. 

The next day I was feeling not my best (felt insecure in my appearance) so I never answered his snap from the night before. Since I never answered, he double snapped me and then was left on delivered for another hour until I worked up the courage to answer and send a pic of my face back. I’m total, he was left on delivered for 11 hours… Everything was dry that day prob bc I basically ignored him. That night we only texted back and forth like four times and then he never responded but I think maybe he just fell asleep. The next day was another dry day and he was left on delivered by me for like 10 hours. I answered, he responded, and then I responded and then he wouldn’t open it for another 10 hours (which is fair guess lol). Anyway, he finally responded last night, I did as well, and then got left on open this morning and still am on open for 11 hours now. Idk if this means it’s over or if he wants me to reach out. What should I do???

When he was home, he invited me over to his house at 4am, and then two other occasions invited me to a bar with his friends… I said no to all because I felt like he only wanted to hook up. But after him inviting me on a date where he is (arcade) the other day and after texting him all night AND him double-snapping me AND sending me voice messages, I’m thinking that maybe he actually liked me and I ruined it?

My doctor (rightfully) stopped refilling my pain medication. This lead to some bad choices. I almost lost my career and did lose my marriage. I’ve been divorced for 2.5 years. I have one misdemeanor(reduced from 3 felonies) from the case. I went to to rehab, had three years of probation which I completed no problem. I’ve been clean ever since. Luckily only one small local news website published my case when I was arrested 5 years ago. It was posted on their Facebook page and man, people were really nasty in the comments. If you google my name there is a link to that same story. Luckily though there’s someone with my same name who is much more active online and the story is now on the 4th page of results. 

I’m not trying to hide it from anyone but I’m also not sure when to bring it up. I’ve been to therapy about it because it was a pretty complex case. It wasn’t just me having pills that weren’t mine and the cops found them. The whole experience has left me with PTSD according to my psychiatrist. 

Any thoughts? My ex wife is the only person I ever stayed with longer than a couple months and we were together 12 years.

We have a very healthy and good relationship and we both want the long term goals of marriage and kids, though I realize it would be way too soon for us to move in under normal circumstances. The thing is, I just think it’s a bit silly for us to both be paying 1k+ for apartments when I have a two bedroom with a room I’m not using. She’s joked about moving in before when she was drunk but we really haven’t discussed it sober. I just think it would make a ton of sense for both of us financially if she just rented my room for a few reasons. I could quit my second side job, she could pay significantly less than if she had her own place and still save up for a house, and I already have all the things that you need to buy for your first place like a washer and drier, furniture, kitchen appliances, etc. 

I’m perfectly fine with her having her own space and room and not being together 24/7 with her living here and I want to talk to her and explain all that and pitch the idea but I’m just wondering if I’m being crazy here.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rze32t/would_it_be_weird_to_ask_my_girlfriend_to_rent_my/
27,rze34y,1641686669,"I want to keep my relationship stable, and keep toxicity out."," Hello everyone. Quick warning, this is going to be a LONG post, to simply set a timeline, and to explain my situation in full. I'll include a TLDR at the end to save your poor eyes from all that lengthy ranting.

I am in desperate need of advice. I have never been so emotionally spent and exhausted, and the waves of despair and anger are starting to drive me to the end of my rope. I don’t know what to do anymore, and what emotions are fair to feel and which are not. 

Let's start with the beginning of 2021. I am an active duty military member, and I began with a lovely deployment notice. Not such a huge deal, my branch and my position does not really get very dangerous deployments. It was supposed to be a piece of cake. It was not. 

To explain myself, I am someone who is very self conscious about her self image. I am 19, barely out of high school, and I married someone who I thought would be my lifelong partner in sept. of 2020. We had been together since I was thirteen just after my mother’s passing, and I thought that he was the best thing to ever happen to me. He knew I felt that way, and it is what I give credit to a lot of our issues. His arrogance, and my baggage. And things were okay, for a little while. I enlisted to provide, because it has always been my dream to have a happy, perfect and well cared for family. He was injured previously from his own failed enlistment attempt whilst we were still in high school, (though all doctors said he was fine..) and that was a common excuse he used not to work and only allow me to. The image I projected to my co-workers and family that I was happy was far from the truth. We fought often, and he constantly verbally abused me, and there were occasional instances of physical abuse. Gaslighting me because I had issues with the way that he refused to work and did not cook even, or look after our dog. And then, to top it off, cheating on me by sexting with multiple women online. 

I didn't see the issues until I deployed and met people who, thankfully, knew me too little to not be totally honest with me. They helped me see that I was not in a normal position and that the manipulation ran deep. I could do better.. And by July, I informed my husband that by October when I came home, he was to leave our apartment and I would be filing for divorce. 

If you would expect that to have been it, honestly, same here. But, enter a friend from Japan who had confessed to me whilst I was engaged a year prior, though I had no feelings for. I trusted this friend a lot.. And I expected those feelings to die, with the passage of time, and our multiple lengthy discussions about how I did not feel the same way. I needed someone to talk to-- anyone. I trusted him. But, once he found out about my divorce, he started to change almost instantly. He started making countless advances toward me over text despite the many times that I warned him I felt uncomfortable, I wanted to be treated as a friend, and that if he continued down this path, he would be hurt (to which he consistently and foolishly stated, “I don’t care.”). I cared for him deeply and the last thing I wanted was his pain. But.. he would always stop for a little while.. Before continuing before I could realize it, and lines were getting blurred no matter how hard I tried to keep them strict. I am not all innocent in allowing this to happen and occasionally even partaking in a comment or two. However.. His persistence and my weakness of not cutting him off out of fear I would lose him resulted in a horrid fallout, all rooting with a choice to visit in person once I returned after he saw his family, in what I thought would be a warm hearted friendly reunion. 

Before this friend of mine and I visited, we can call him A. I was to see my own family a couple of states away for my brother’s big wedding. I was excited.. My brother deserves happiness more than anyone I know, given all that he and myself have been through. But, whilst I was there, I made a connection with a childhood family friend, and my eldest brother’s best friend, who we can call J. I have known him longer than even my husband, and he has always been (as cringe as it sounds) ‘My older brother’s cute friend that is way out of my league.’. He’s kind, understanding, and always makes me laugh. He has always been very sweet to me, but for the first time it felt as if he were flirting with me during my stay.. Though, I don’t value myself much. I kept telling myself I was imagining it, and there was simply no way.. And then I went home, and my cursed visit with A began. 

Off the bat, as soon as I saw him in person, The air around him changed very much compared to how it felt when I knew him for over a year at this point prior. He brought many gifts to me from overseas.. But it reeked to me of an ulterior motive past just just being friends. I appreciated them.. But they made me feel a little uncomfortable as well, and I felt guilty taking them at all. But I knew it would only hurt him more were I to refuse, or at least, that's what I thought. Following the course of the week, he helped me move apartments, and insisted on paying for many things, despite me telling him over and over again that not only does he not need to, I don’t really want him to. But he did anyway.. He helped me move, and things were a little awkward from there on. He seemed to be passive aggressive because I had him sleep on the couch as if I were supposed to just let him hop into bed with me, and eventually things exploded into a big confrontation. We had a conversation about how I felt about him.. And how I didn’t, and tears were shed on both sides. We didn’t talk.. We avoided one another in my own home for a day or two before I gently suggested (i didn’t kick him out) that maybe he would spend more time with his family, and off he went. 

In turn, once he left, J came over to visit to check on me from my home state, about 5 hrs away, because we had discussed him visiting anyway when I was down for my brother’s wedding. I was in a rough emotional state.. And he was worried. He spent four days with me, and nothing super strange happened. We ate out.. I cooked. We explored the town.. And eventually, he confesses to me. At this point I had emotionally cut ties from my husband about five months ago, and I really admired J. I felt love again, despite thinking I was not deserving of it. Maybe I still am not ready.. But I wanted to take a leap of faith. And I did.. And I don’t regret it. I have never felt so respected and heard and genuinely loved before.. And I feel happy in that aspect. It has been three months since then, and we are making the distance work. 

Suffice to say, when I told A about this over the phone, he exploded. He said that I was a terrible, toxic person. He said that I wasted his trip, time, and his money (despite him originally coming down to visit family anyway..) and has been publicly bashing my personality on other reddit pages, without mentioning my name. He said that he hates me more than anyone else, and that I wasn’t really happy with J. That I was just filling a void, that I was a piece of shit, and that everything that happened was my fault. He said I could never be happy, and that he would like nothing else but to watch me burn, and watch me fail. Due to the stress of my divorce, A promotion board that came up, and other personal matters, I began experiencing heart issues and arrhythmias that pre exist in my family. I’ve been in and out of the ER, and my confidence and happiness has taken a big hit. Of course as soon as A saw this on my page, he touted my health issues as proof of how shit of a person I am and seemed almost happy that my health was declining, saying that it was because of “what i did to him”. And things were quiet for a while.. But eventually, we made contact about a month later. He called me horrid again and was accusing me of being some alt account who reached out to him randomly, but after clearing it up, we were.. Okay, for a few days. I thought we could really make up.. Apologize, take blame where we both needed to. And whilst he messaged me in discord feigning concern and kindness, he still continued to publicly bash and call me horrible things. At that time.. I said nothing, and simply removed him. 

Some people might even be able to work out who I am based on this.. And If so, I hope that you can have an open mind about there being more than one face to a story. I am not a monster. I am a person, and I didn’t simply add fuel to the fire just to watch it burn. I’m hurting, too. And I just want this to get better, or at least easier. 

For advice.. I want honest opinions. I know I must stop reaching out to him to try to fix something broken beyond belief, and I think starting now.. I am done with it. Once I saw what he was continuing to say about me, I couldn't. My heart hurts so much, I can’t comprehend how someone I cared about so much could paint such an awful image of me and say those things, as some things cannot be excused out of heartbreak, in my opinion. I don’t hate him, even if he hates me. I just.. Hurt. I hurt so much. Please, tell me what I did wrong, and what I could do better. Is this all my fault? I keep blaming myself. I won't let the pain swallow me whole anymore. I have grown past that. But not allowing it to weigh on me at all is cowardly. 

And any advice from someone who has gone through anything similar on how I can continue this relationship that I have found without letting the toxicity reach me would make me so happy. Some of the things A said really do get to me. I.. I know I am happy with J, but sometimes those words come back to haunt me. I don’t want to worry about anyone else in my life who has nothing but toxicity to add, I want to fortify this newfound happiness and work on myself.

TLDR: I went through a messy relationship/divorce and a toxic friend who wanted a relationship with me hates me when I chose someone else. I want to work on my relationship and keep it stable.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rze34y/i_want_to_keep_my_relationship_stable_and_keep/
28,rze8of,1641687084,Husk,"So I had been seeing this woman for just under two months (both of us are in our early to mid thirties). I have had a kind of long history of dating, but this time was different, and felt like the real deal.

Both of us shared the same likes, and both of us found eachother's hobbies and intertests super interesting, both career driven, and somewhat stable.

The thing that made this different compared to the other women I had dated was the mutual acts of service - she brought me soup when I was unwell, I'd bring her lunch when she was working from home, making each other coffee in the morning, etc.

Things looked like they were ramping up, sex was amazing, she had introduced me to her friends, and she even had a polaroid of her and I up on her fridge.

We had spent Christmas Eve together, enjoyed a great meal cooked by her, cuddled up on the couch for a wholesome christmas movie, exchanged gifts. My family doesnt really celebrate the holiday, so for me, it was a great feeling that someone wanted to share their Christmas with me.

Later that evening, when intimate, we both told each other that we were really into each other.

The time between Christmas, she spent time with family, and visited friends. During this time, we had made plans to see eachother and do things when she had returned from visiting her friends. I had opened up letting her I know I was a little down because I couldnt arrange plans for NYE, as my friends live far and wide/ are isolating. I also told her that I miss her and that I'm looking forward to seeing her again. I also mentioned that I had really appreciated spending Christmas Eve with her, as explained above that my family doesnt really do Christmas. You know, words of affirmation, nothing too clingy or cringe. All I said that what I missed her, appreciated her, and tat I was looking forward to seeing her.

Three days after christmas, she asked to see me, came over to my place, explained that this was not working, that I'm more open with feelings compared to her. That she might contact me in a few weeks, and that we were breaking up.

The following day after exchanging a couple of messages, she explained to me that during the time that we had been together, she should have been feeling more strongly about me than she really did, and it didnt feel that those feelings would change, and that she felt that it was unfair to pretend otherwise.

Not long after that, I reinstalled a dating app and she was the first person to pop up to swipe on. That did feel like a bit of a blow. I know I deleted mine when we were dating, but I didn't ask her to delete hers - so I'm just assuming that the profile was still active while we were seeing eachother.

If she was feeling this way for a while, why make plans to see eachother when she had returned, why tell me that she was really into me - only to backflip a couple of days later?

I'm also unsure why she still follows me on instagram. Maybe she'll contact me in a week or two, maybe she's following to keep tabs on what I'm up to, maybe she just has not thought about it and just has not unfollowed.

Being someone who has dated quite a fair bit over the past few years, I dont understand why people need to put a timeline on things - I mean I'm happy to just pursue a friendship if it looks like a romantic relationship isnt going to continue or to form. It seems that everone is just looking for cliche movie fireworks, and are less interested in taking a step back to let a friendship grow. Especially being in my thirties, already finding it difficult to establis new frienships in a new city.

I'm looking for answers that I'm not going to get, I just felt that venting to random people on the intenet may put some things into perspective. I'm feeling quite empty at the moment, and I'm a bit of a husk of my former self.

Thanks for taking the time to read through my wall of text.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rze8of/husk/

30,rzebbq,1641687289,How do I love him well?,"My bf(21M) and I(18F) have been together for nearly a month after being close friends for several months. It’s worth mentioning that I’ve been in two relationships before, and I’m a sophomore in college so my age is not indicative of my maturity. 

We confided in each other about nearly everything before the relationship even started, and both of us deal with major depression. We’re also both recovering from longtime porn habits which we are actively in recovery from.

Because of our faith we both have some pretty firm convictions about a relationship built not on physical affection alone but on emotional attraction and real love. However because of our history with porn we’re both pretty sexual people and our relationship is very physical.

Recently he expressed concern (which I share) that our relationship is too reliant on the physical, and he wanted to make an effort to stay away from sexual contact for a while in favor of planned intentional dates. He confessed to having major commitment issues in previous relationships, and would end relationships in the past when they became too difficult. I totally understand that and I agree to pulling back- but he cares so much about putting effort in and he cares so much about me and I don’t want to lose him. 

I guess I’m asking is what I can do to make him feel more loved and secure? I truly love him so much.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rzebbq/how_do_i_love_him_well/
31,rzec61,1641687354,Expectations?,"What expectations do girls have from hookups? I recently had a debate with a girl friend and we basically agreed on this: the point of a hookup is to orgasm, once the guy has his, its understandable that he leaves. When you put in the work, its because you care about the person a.k.a have some relationship. But if its just a random hookup...

Anyway it got me thinking and made me a bit nervous. I (19M) recently made some dating profiles and already have a lot of matches. Due to some circumstances I am looking mainly for hookups. However I must say im not experienced. I have had sex only once and it was short. I can say with enough confidence that I have no idea what im doing. 

Of course I wont go around telling girls this. And of course I wont hype myself too much only to dissapoint. Even though it makes sense for me to just do my thing and leave... I dont want to dissapoint.

So my question is what expectations do girls have from hookups (like on tinder)? What is on your mind when you tell the guy to come over? Or reversed...

I met up with some old friends and as the night progressed more folks joined our little group. It’s a dive bar so eventually some random small talk happened. 

Eventually the topic of sex came up and some folks mentioned they were single but we’re hooking up. My turn kinda came up to say something and as soon as I mentioned that it’s been about a year since I had sex, the women kinda treated me differently. At first they kinda gasped and were like “really?…oh” and then they just kinda looked at each other and one of them said “well I’m sure it’ll happen. Just put yourself out there”. 

It felt odd because prior to me saying anything. They would be next to me. Making small talk, we would converse a bit. Some jokes here and there.

She has never lived on her own in her life and her parents do a lot of things for her such as cook and buy groceries. Her mom is a housewife so she has a lot of time to do things. I dont like Ohio at all because of the cold weather and lack of opportunities. Currently, I live in the South and love it a lot but would give a lot up to be with her (would have to move back and be in Ohio the rest of my life). The fact she is not independent worries me because I dont know how long I can wait for her to grow as I continue to go back and forth from state to state to see if this works. She also has not given me a set timeline because she does not feel our relationship is stable enough to give me one (we have been on and off for 3 years). I told her that I, not really a fan of her parents spoiling her at her age and the fact I have to go over her parents house when I visit her. She immediately says I hate her parents which isnt true I just like privacy (she told her parents I said this later). I dont know what to do with this because I feel like I am too old to wait but at the same time she is very sweet, thoughtful, gorgeous and our chemistry is great. What would you do in my situation?

48,rzgdse,1641693182,Guy still watches my social media after ghosting me. Why?,"I met John on vacation, hung out over the course of several days together. I started to catch feelings for him, and I could sort of tell that he liked me too. He got jealous because another guy, Jim, was hitting on me when I was drunk, and Jim wanted to hook up, and John drunkenly told a bunch of people that he liked me.

I pulled him to the side when I found out and asked him if that were true. Turns out, he had a girlfriend the entire time. I was disappointed, but since we live in different countries, I figured we could be internet friends at least. However, he rejected my Instagram request. I blocked John for a couple of days. Because he wanted to do the right thing for his girlfriend. I understand, but I don't like being treated as if I don't exist.

The day after, Jim messaged me asking me if I was okay. I wasn't. I told him that I hated John. John should come clean about his feelings, and tell his girlfriend that he's an asshole to her, and let her go. I was crying, and I said a lot of things I shouldn't have. I told Jim that I about my bulimia problem, and my suicidal thoughts. That I was really struggling, and that I think about ending it almost every day.

Jim was definitely shaken by what I said, but he still tried to be caring and empathetic to my situation. However, he told another friend, and that friend told John. John knows what I said, and he hasn't done anything to me, but all I know is that he broke up with his girlfriend. I don't know if he told her about me, but they're not together anymore. Now, he's always looking at my social media. Whether its TikTok, Twitter, he always views my things.

Tl;dr: guy got jealous that some other dude was hitting on me. He told everyone that he liked me, when he actually had a girlfriend the entire time. He cut off all contact with me. I got upset by what he did, and I told a mutual friend that I was struggling, especially because I have bulimia and thoughts of suicide.

He surprised me at the end when he got all nervous and said “let me take you out on a coffee date.” Then gave me a long kiss on the head??

After my last relationship, I spent some time by myself, but when I got back out there and tried dating again, I seem to only be able to either have very casual and surface level relationships or if I try being more serious about someone, I usually call it quits after around 3 months. What happens is I usually either disconnect/lose my feelings for them or I start seeing problems emerging in the relationship and end it. For example, if there’s conflict, struggles, differences between us, I always think “okay maybe they’re just not the right person for me” and walk away.
I don’t seem to have the capacity to stay and make it work/work through things or talk them out and yet I know this is an important relationship skill.
I abandon relationships before they even start.
Truth is I don’t want to be an asshole (I don’t want to create expectations on someone only to disappoint them later like I’ve been doing) and I still want to connect with others.

However, when I was 17 I was SA’d by a classmate but I couldn’t identify it as that-resulting in me (stupidly) proclaiming that I had my first kiss. It caused a rift between my best guy friend and he was very upset to say the least. 

I’ve never actually told my guy friend that is what really happened. I couldn’t. 

For the next 7 years, there was a lot of argumentative days between him and I-and he’d flirt with my friends. I hated it. 

He doesn’t know this, but I would go on to be drugged one more time by a different man, and I’ve struggled with depression quite a bit. Almost committed suicide. 

I saw my first love back in November and I realized then I would always love him, but because he was in a relationship with another girl, I’d never tell him out of respect for his relationship. 

When I saw him in November, I was worried because of our history that he wouldn’t even want to see me. But he did, and he came back from working out and when I walked in, I immediately felt calm around him. 

The whole time that I was at his house, I could feel his eyes on me when I was talking to his family. In the photo we took together, he has his arms around me and is holding me close. 

When I left, I was a little nervous. But he wrapped me up into a hug and held me there for a few minutes. 

I posted the photo on Facebook, thinking it was no big deal, and tagged them in it. 

He and his girlfriend broke up recently after 5 years, and I feel bad because I feel like I caused it, even though I never directly told him that I have feelings for him still. 

I thought about reaching out to him, but then I realized I want to give him space until I see him a few months from now.

I know in  the end its up to me and what I want to do with my life. What others do is not necessarily right for me. But I've had a really hard time making up my mind. Here are some of the arguments that take me for and against marriage:

For:

-long term relationships beat short term relationships in terms of overall value and significance.

Against:

-that doesn't necessarily mean you need to be ""married"" to someone in order to form a long term bond.

For:

-it takes care of the reproductive question so you can focus on other things. Instead of constantly having to learn a new person, you have a go to person for your intimate relationship needs.

Against:

-you are arbitrarily locking yourself to someone who may change, who you may not be compatible with down the line.

For:

-it gives you stability 

Against

-it restricts mobility and freedom becaus everything you do must work for both of you.

For:

-you can make exponential more money since you combine finances and grow together. 

Against:

-whoever makes more is taking a significant financial risk and may end up paying money to someone whom they love but can't see anymore.

For:

-I have fun in relationships and love spending time with my girlfriend 

Against:

-that still doesn't mean we need to get married to keep enjoying each other

For:

-its a religious sacrament and seen as spiritual and holy

Against:

-I am not very religious anymore

I am in NO way interested in dating this girl as I don't find her attractive in terms of looks(yes I am a superficial @$$hole sorry😂)

My social l skills are mostly fine, I am average appearance wise etc. 

My social life needs some work but I am working on it. 

The point of the post is that I just felt jealous. Not in a toxic way but I just thought"" How great for them that they just clicked like that"" I am trying to find something similar while improving  what I want to improve and  it is just not working.I am not feeling like it is hopeless but it just hasn't happened but I just felt a bit unmotivated and helpless.

1) Fill out the ""About Me"". It doesn't matter how good you look, if you do not have this filled in - I don't know your interests which means I have to ask you, which I don't have time to do. I would rather click the check mark for someone I know has similar interests as my friend.  
On the plus side as well - If you do have this filled in and you're average looking or even on the ladder, I will absolutely click the check mark just because you guys have so much in common that looks can be overlooked.

2) Short one word answers are the worst. Please do not do this. 

3) Answer those prompts that ask you details about yourself, it goes a long way, trust me.

4) Everyone loves a funny person, if you can make your Bio funny - I guarantee you'll get more people connecting with you.

I recently got out of a 3 month long relationship. She was exactly what I wanted but things just ended up not working out and she left me. I took it pretty well and it doesn't bother me. But I've been a bit lonely bc I'm stuck with my parents on winter break until college starts up. I feel like things between me and her got cut short and that I won't find someone like her again.

Me and this girl are buddies at work and we chat about relationships a lot. She said she's got a friend that hadn't dated before. We talked about it and eventually I suggested that her friend and I should get to know each other. She thought it was a good idea so she gave me her snap.

I'm planning on texting her tomorrow and seeing where it goes. 

The issue is that I don't really know what I want at this point. I haven't had sex in like 5 months bc my ex didn't believe in sex until marriage (which I was cool with). I also want to hook up a lot bc my ex before this one slept around a lot a while after we broke up and a part of me needs to do the same to get even. She's starting to eat at my mind. I was fine while I was with my last girl but it's creeping back on me now that I'm alone, probably bc she's the last person I had sex with and was the only person I had sex with for close to a year.

My co-worker says that she's a shy good girl which is my type. But a part of me feels like I shouldn't jump into this bc if she doesn't want to have sex then I'd let her down by either breaking things off or replacing her with another girl.

From the pictures I've seen, she looks real cute. 

I just don't want her getting too attatched early on or jump into things too fast. I'd need to know what page she is on when it comes to sex first before we're committed.

&amp; ps before I get any harsh comments i’m not calling him/her ugly by any means he/she is handsome/beautiful but just very different from my type and I’m honestly trying to get that old thinking outside my head of sticking to a type that wasn’t beneficial to me at all when this could be my soulmate.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rzirpp/how_to_overcome_physical_appearances_or_my_usual/

82,rzj8gc,1641702128,My bf lied to me and had his cousin cover it up.,"So, I had talked to my boyfriend about seeing the new Spiderman movie. We've been together for 4 months. I was excited to go with him! One day he went out to the mall with his cousin and brother, he told me they just shopped around and ate. I do remember looking at the clock and being like 'wow, they've been there for awhile', I didn't care I just made the observation. His cousin didn't know he had said he would go with me until AFTER they finished the movie, where my bf told him to keep quiet about it to me. Well, me, my bf, his cousin and his girl were all hanging out just talking when she asked ""so how was the new Spiderman movie"". They both were dead silent and I looked around like ""Wait... you guys went? Why didn't you tell me?"" They awkwardly scrambled to explain it but eventually just stopped talking and we all just sat there in a silence. His girl texted me saying ""I'm so sorry I didn't know they did that. I'm so sad right now."" The amount of anxiety I was feeling built up until I broke the silence, telling them what they did was really shitty and asking why they didn't tell me they went. I got up after saying that and went into the bedroom. His cousin and his girl left not even 5 minutes later. I would have just gone with my friend if he had said he was going to watch it so it made no sense for him to lie. On top of that, he agreed to go with me THIS WEEK and i offered to buy the tickets, meaning he was lettting me pay for him to go AGAIN without telling me he'd already seen it.

I'm currently in the bed and he's sleeping on the couch. Really feeling hurt because it was such a small thing and there was no reason to lie. This just broke so much trust with me and I'm really considering our relationship here. Am I making a big deal out of this?

In the photo we have together, he has his arms wrapped around me. HE initiated it, I did not. Because of our rough history together, I was hesitant about hugging him until I saw how he reacted. 

It was put on social media and a few days after that, he and his long term GF broke up after 5 years and now I feel awful. 

I would never break up a relationship because I’ve been on the other side of it and I know how awful it feels. 

I am telling Reddit the truth that I did not reveal my feelings for him out of respect for his girlfriend. 

He is holding me in the photo and he held me and hugged me before I left.

84,rzj9ek,1641702213,Mutual Heartbreak,"Today my (ex)girlfriend and I mutually decided to break up. Things had been slowly developing over 6 months or so and we decided to officially give it a go over the past month.

We were both heartbroken. We each acknowledged that we thought the other was the one at first and that we loved almost every single thing about the other person. The show stopper - we operate totally differently and it would never work in a relationship. She takes a very laid back approach to any of her relationships/friendships whereas I'm very involved. She would have inevitably felt constrained and I would have felt neglected.

Feeling pretty deflated. Feel like I found the right person minus this one crucial piece. I miss her already and I know she's sitting out there feeling the same about me. Don't know how I can get back out there any time soon, this was a big blow.

I just started looking into dating as I’ve been busy trying to complete my four calc classes/Research programs before college, so I’m a bit late to the party. Recently, a girl who I’ve tried to show interest in (First Time trying) has apparently fallen for me and likes me ALOT. She’s VERY sweet and a pretty girl and I’ve been loving talking with her and getting to know her. She is quite intelligent and she is very passionate. I thought this girl was like me in values and compatibility (Abstinence, Christian religious values). Yesterday, I found out this girl has engaged in a hookup and has gone for questionable guys. She hasn’t dated but I just don’t think I can even talk to her anymore with romantic intent. How can I get away from her romantically (I’d love to keep friendship), and why is society so sex positive even in circles that would be considered socially conservative? Why is my vow to abstain and wanting a partner to do it with me so rare now?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rzjhhc/m17_my_values_are_very_conservative_morally_and/

However, I don't think I could say I've ever felt romantic interest in someone the first time I've met them. Is this attraction something that tends to grow over a few dates, or do most people end good first dates feeling romantic feelings rather than just platonic ones? Is there any point to another date it I'm not sure if I'm attracted to him, or should I wait and see? He's a truly lovely guy and I would hate to lead him on.

89,rzjngv,1641703509,Are these dating roadblocks as important as it seems?,"So I am a 24 year old guy. I have been told that I'm attractive, I have a stable job of over 6 years, I am always researching or learning something, I play 5 instruments and make music, playing shows with a band, and I've been told that I have a fairly magnetic personality despite my more loner quiet outside. People are surprised when they learn that I haven't been in a relationship yet. 

With that said it's of course not the full picture. There are some negative things as well that is beyond my control at the moment., Despite being 24, I still live at home with my mother and brother due to rent in my city being 3x what I make (I make bove minimum wage), and because my street has literally no room for one, I dont have a car either. I can get places no problem but it can sometimes get in the way. Along with that I don't get hints ever being that I just cannot recognize any unspoken social cue. (thanks autism/adhd combo)

With those cons, I have just not had any success literally ever. I gotta ask. Are these cons deal breakers that's fairly common? And if so, is there anything I can do to mitigate the for lack of a better term, cloud that kinda hovers over this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rzjngv/are_these_dating_roadblocks_as_important_as_it/

The first thing I disliked was he kept talking about how much money he has and my friend was with me. He offered to buy us things….I felt he was trying to buy me. I never had someone offer to buy me something. I immediately found this a red flag, I honestly felt uncomfortable. I was honest with him about rescheduling the meet up since I have not been working. He insisted he didn’t care and really want to meet me, He paid for my friend and mine movie ticket. While waiting for the movie to start, we were talking about the clothing store shein. He said he recently ordered about $300 worth of clothing. I saw he ordered mostly woman clothing and accessories. I thought to myself maybe that’s for his sister. Then when he closed the app I saw a girl and a caption that said “I love you”. She was showing a lot of skin….I immediately felt disrespected. I lied to him saying my brother needed the car back since I was driving his car. He said “that’s fine” and proceeded to leave with me. That’s when I said “we should go out separate ways. He said “alright” then walked away. I texted him afterwards telling him what happened and to take care. He replied with “you’re very immature, u don’t even talk”. He blocked me immediately after I replied. I don’t usually talk a lot to people i have never met before. At the same time I feel I dodged a bullet. Never have I dealt with this before.

When I do start talking with someone I always want to start out as friends so we can get to know one another.  I try to keep the conversations organic by asking questions about them like their likes, dislikes, beliefs, etc.  And of course I respond in kind about myself.  

I never bombard people with messages, I always send either one or two messages and wait until they respond before I continue the conversation.  I don't love bomb people, and I keep talk about sexual things out unless the person wants to talk about that sort of thing.  I just try to get to know them as a person, see if there's any chemistry between us, yet despite that it never fails to lead towards the results I listed earlier.

Some of them are up front about it and some of them have led me on and made me think they wanted something more when they didn’t. I’m pretty good at weeding people out because I don’t like hookups but it happens anyways and it hurts.

And even when someone seems to want a bit of a connection or an actual relationship I feel like I’m always the one who cares more and is more invested. And that’s not a negative on their part, I have a really anxious attachment style and it’s not a good thing but it still makes me feel sad and unwanted.

Idk. I was in a relationship from age 15-17 and I don’t miss my ex but I miss being committed and in love with someone.

I was brought up very religious and dating wasn't considered acceptable growing up. I realized I was agnostic in my early teens but I didn't want to disappoint my parents. So I tired to live by their ideals regardless. It took me until I was twenty to realise that was going to be impossible and I was just making myself miserable.

Unfortunately by then I'd started to suffer some major health complications. Heart problems that I won't get into but during that time. I didn't think dating someone would be remotely fair on them. If I just randomly kicked the bucket, so I didn't. It took until I was 24 to regain a clean bill of health which I'm forever grateful for. 

Not long after I was lucky enough to meet someone through a friend at uni we dated for 6 months. I loved the experience and time spent with her consist of my most precious memories. She was religious but didn't mind that I wasn't but also didn't believe in sex before marriage. 

I understood and the last thing I wanted to do was coerce someone, so the most we did was kiss and cuddle. Breaking up with her was painful but the right thing to do for varies reasons. However it took some time afterwards to get my head back on straight. Now I just turned 26 I've let work take over my life.
