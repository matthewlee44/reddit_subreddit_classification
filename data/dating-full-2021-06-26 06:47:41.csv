I've known her from Christmas when she started working at my job, didn't really speak to her much but she became quickly attached to me at the start of the year when we got to know each other. I thought it was a little bit odd at first how I was the first port of call for her late night random thoughts as it did seem she was obsessed/infatuated with me as I didn't treat her any differently than the other girls I work with. Though I suppose I have helped her with some personal issues and gave meaningful advice.

It all came to a head last Saturday when she literally asked me to have sex with her after a normal conversation sterred into that direction and honestly I was like why not provided the workplace didn't know. We didn't work together until the Wednesday of that week and one of the other girls informed me she actually posted about me on her private snapchat story which sent my alarm bells ringing.

I wanted to talk to her about the sex thing to make sure she understood what she was agreeing to but tried to say she didn't remember having that conversation. I joked about did she need to see the texts to jog her memory and she was like ""omg no please don't"" but then said it's none of anyones business what we get up to when I told her to be careful about what she posts so she obviously does remember.

I talked to her on Friday and said I needed to speak with her and she thought it was the sex thing again, said she was embarrassed about it and I asked her if she wanted to go out sometime which she said yes to obviously. She thought I had no interest and that's why she didn't ask me before. Though that's a little confusing considering she literally asked me to have sex with her. I hope she doesn't expect to get it on at work since we can't do it at hers or mine due to logistics issues.

That night we talked and I said we'd talk about sex some other time and what we are both looking for. She said it was the most adult and mature message she has ever received which was very nice to hear. Though she said we'd probably have different views on what we want as she ""never liked being a one man's girl idk"" but is open to talking it over.

I see a lot of girls with these profile pics that are kind of raunchy and super suggestive/revealing so naturally I assume they are interested in hooking up. Which is what I’m interested in at that time (Though not exclusively). I want something serious too though  not exclusively. 
I’m not kidding when they show images that are directed at their body with nothing on. It kinda lures you in.

I have more self control than that. I can tell they’re trying to drive me crazy or something. And I’m respectful when I say this. But 
What are they testing here? I know it’s a game of some kind. It’s come up repeatedly in online dating. It doesn’t drive me crazy so much as it’s just more of a “that’s odd” kind of a thing. (Not to say I’m not enjoying the free eye candy)
I answer back. Most of the time they approach me first or send me a like when I’m minding my own business. 
I may send out a few likes here and there but I know what not to chase. They end up flaking off which is kind of just odd. I think they expect it to have a stronger effect on me. Might be fun for them. Trying to crush me or something. And I might be willing to take this test of theirs and pass it if I just knew if I was being tested directly (which is never  “IF”, it’s WHEN; which is all the damn time) anyways, My question again is why they do this, what can I do about it to answer correctly in THEIR world if I were to play this game? and why would it would be worth it? Why waste my time?  Is there a way to even beat this game? Or should I just get the hell out of there?

So I met this girl on a dating app about 3 months ago and we really kicked it off. We talked for a few weeks before deciding to meet. Turns out we live about 5 minutes apart! We have a lot in common, like a lot of the same movies and music and have the same sense of humor.  We’ve been going out for about two months now when the topic of dating apps came up and we both found out the two of us had deleted it off our phones cause we didn’t think we needed it anymore. 


I got the sense she’s a genuine, honest person which is so hard to find these days (I had bad experiences lately.) Meeting her has been such a breath of fresh air. A lot of girls wait for the guy to make the first move. This girl actually asks me out first and plans dates, I’ve never met someone like this honestly. Maybe I was looking at the wrong girls.


Tonight in my car, the conversation was dying and I just said “I’m just gonna be up front, do you wanna make out?”
And she said was waiting for me to ask. So we spent a good 15 minutes driving around trying to find a dark enough spot, laughing at how silly it all was. Eventually we found a dark parking lot and we moved to backseat where we made out intensely, she straddled me and it was really hot and passionate and we both said we haven’t had an experience like that. Eventually we just embraced in the back seat, holding hands and listening to music (arctic monkeys, her favorite band). That’s when I decided to tell her I really like spending time with her, and after all these dates, was wondering if she wanted to be my girlfriend, which she quickly agreed to.

I would catch him though cause I would eventually realize they have the same mannerisms when speaking and same personality.

 I think my anxiety was triggered once my partner admitted he was attracted to someone at his gym and wondering if she had a bf, which was probably my fault for asking about his attraction to others.

25M here - so for context, one of my close friend's has a work friend (26F), who I saw in one of her Instagram posts a long time ago. For years, I've had a lack of confidence, so I never mentioned to my friend that I thought she was cute, but after spending the last year working on myself in many ways, I have adopted a different personality / level of balanced confidence.

So a few days ago, I mentioned to her that I'm actually interested in her friend. She was ecstatic and immediately said we would be a great fit. As we were hanging out, my friend texted this girl and asked how her dating life was going / whether she was interested in being set up.

Said girl said that she had only recently gotten back onto apps after taking a break, but was keen on something like this. My friend then sent her a message telling her about me (almost like a dating app bio) and sent my Instagram. To that she responded positively and maintained that she was interested.

My friend then gave me this girl's number. I sent her a text earlier to just introduce myself / say I got her number from our friend, little joke acknowledging it was funny/weird, and asked how her weekend was going.

Couple of hours later, she replied and acknowledged the joke and seemed to like it, then replied appropriately and asked how my weekend was going.

Now we've never met each other in person, and both seem to only have had interactions through dating apps. I'm very forward and usually like to match, chat for a day or two and ask them out for a drink (not a fan of wasting time - and this works more often than not).

Given this situation is slightly different, and I have 0 experience in this, I'm now feeling a bit nervy / conscious which is almost throwing me off my normal mindset.

Should I simply approach her like another dating app match, or be more conscious in conversation? I do want to hint at grabbing a drink in the next few messages but don't want to force anything.

Tips / advice?

We’re also in a long distance relationship)

Before we start things off, I just wanna say that no matter what, I love my girlfriend. I absolutely love and adore her. She’s beautiful, pretty, amazing, kind, generous, thoughtful, smart/intelligent, sexy, hot as fuck, and just an overall great person and girlfriend. I’m so lucky to have her in my life and she’s genuinely one of the best things that’s ever happened to me. I don’t know what the fuck I did to deserve her. 

However, if I’m being honest here, her lack of trust and faith in me breaks my heart and makes me question my worth as a boyfriend. I truly do love and cherish her from the bottom of my heart but she’s almost always accusing me of liking other girls that are physically/geographically closer to me. She’s particularly fixated on this one girl who I went to middle school with and use to like back then; she always brings her up (I never bring her up) and she makes comparisons of herself to that old middle school crush (who I haven’t even talked to anymore for literally a couple years by this point). I’ve even stopped following her and other girls and stopped liking their pictures when I found out that me doing so made my girlfriend insecure because hey, it’s no big deal I respect her enough to do that courtesy for her. But it gets to the point where if I’m just eating with my friends (who are literally all guys) and we go out in public to eat and hang out, she accuses me of hanging out with other girls or whatever. 

It’s been an emotional roller coaster to say the least and it makes me sad that my girlfriend doesn’t full trust, faith, and confidence in me while I have complete trust and confidence that she’s loyal to me and our relationship. I don’t like nor do I want other girls, I only want her. I’ll be straight up honest, I’ll see a cute girl out in public and think “damn she’s cute” but at the end of the day, it’s my girlfriend who I care about and want the most. I’m loyal to and I respect her enough to not hit on other girls even though we’re thousands of miles apart from one another and I like to think that she employs the same logic. But it gets really taxing having her tell me that I’m cheating on her with someone else when all I’m doing is literally hanging out with my friends and she’s literally the only girl who I talk to on a regular, daily basis. Like, here’s me pouring out my love, devotion, and admiration for her and I’m all hers but then she’s telling me that I like other girls who are physically closer to me. 

It just hurts me that here I am, loving and caring about her, and she’s gonna tell me all this. It doesn’t help that I work a physically and mentally demanding job. Whenever I come back from work and decompress for the day, seeing her accuse me of cheating or not being faithful shatters my heart and makes me feel down. And what hurts me the most is whenever she asks if we should break up. She tells me that she doesn’t actually mean it whenever she asks that but to me, posing that question is serious and punches me hard in the heart. I know I’m a terrible, shitty boyfriend but I’m trying to do what I can with what I have, especially with my demanding job taking up a large chunk of my day. Sometimes all I wanna do is just relax and talk to her but then sometimes she just has to bring up the fact that I don’t care about her or I’m cheating or whatever. 

Speaking of which, my girlfriend has a certain standard. She wants me to respond on time every time as much as possible and she just asked me if I could stop following other girls. The thing is that I feel like that’s pretty controlling; I sometimes can’t always respond on time because my job can drag me away at literally any moment and if I’m being honest, I think it’s unfair that she wants me to stop following other girls. I personally don’t care if she follows other guys because I don’t like nor do I want to control her and her actions but it doesn’t sit well with me that she wants me to do all this. Maybe I’m just a shitty, terrible asshole of a boyfriend but that’s just how I see it. 

And yes, I’ve told her all of this in some variation multiple times and I always reaffirm my love and affection for her. Despite that though, she continues to do the same above to me and it feels like I’m trying to run through thick mud whenever this happens. 

Again, at the end of the day though, I love her and I truly do believe that she does love and care about me. Despite this, I like to think that we have a great and amazing relationship that continues to keep moving forward no matter what. It’s obviously not perfect and it could be better but I don’t wanna leave her. Never.

To preface it, before him and i began dating last year, him and one of my close friends ended up having sex two years ago and he ghosted her once him and i started to talk. I knew they hooked up and before him and i got serious i talked to her about it trying to clear stuff up and see what her thoughts/ feelings were towards it. She told me she was fine with, doesn’t like him like that and literally felt it was a mistake that they hooked up and wanted us to date. Now fast forward presently, He confessed to me that last summer while me &amp; him were together (we took a break this past november-april) him and my friend would flirt behind my back, than when me and him broke up during the winter he sent her a nude, than currently while he was away he was drunk and had the intention of starting up a conversation with her to flirt, but didnt and ended up messaging her wanting to "" clear the air, apologize"" for how he ghosted her and is trying to come clean to me about all of this because of feeling ashamed and wants to have a clean slate, move on and build a better foundation for our present relationship etc... After him dropping all this news on me i went mute, and just started laughing hysterically because i literally didn't know what to feel. And on top of all this coming to light, me and this group of friends ( including my bf &amp; this friend) are going away to a cottage in a few days... The worst possible timing. 

He kept telling me he's trying to be better for me, and doesn't want to hide anything else, but it makes me sick to my stomach that a) his intentions at first were sneaky and ultimately trying to cheat and b) that i had to go myself, to one of my best friends to clarify all of this information rather than her having the decency to tell me straight up about last summer, about the picture and about him messaging her this past weekend. i'm lost &amp; confused, honestly have no idea how to feel or what to do.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,861056,public,self,A double slap in the face,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o8as8y/a_double_slap_in_the_face/,all_ads,6,,,,,

On several occasions during my life women have just assumed i'm gay. I'm not at all and i literally have no idea why they think this.

Last night i switched my tinder account to everyone as i curious to see what would happen. Forgot about it, came back in an hour. I went from 0 to 45 likes in 60 minutes and it kept going up by the minute. I get a fair amount of matches with women too but nothing to that extent. 

I turned it off as i felt bad for the guys swiping on me. At first it was really nice to have people find me attractive but at the same time i wonder  now if my inability to find a girlfriend is solely because they think i like men. I work in the arts so maybe this plays into it? I don't act particularly feminine, i'm in shape.

I really don't know how to be flirty/intimate simply because you shouldn't treat girls like sex objects, don't sexualized their body, and don't tell them what to wear. No matter what, always be respectful is my go to model. I'm just a respectful oblivious guy.

The problem arise when a girl actually likes me back. I have got consented booty pic's and nudes just being nice, and I delete them because you shouldn't sexualize women's body. I have been completely unbothered because I just want to respect women, though I do say nice about their if they ask me too. I even remember one girl asked me if I saw her booty she sent me, and told I did, I just ignored it. I just want to respect girls bodies so I can be a good guy.

Another problem is clothes. You don't own a girl, she's her person with free will. Yet it gets super when a girl sends me a picture of her in clothing (sometimes really sexy looking), and I just say they look nice whatever they wear. I only had 2 girls (different years i met them) who consented to send me pictures in lingerie, and I just didn't know what to say because I didn't want to disrespect them. I gotta be respectful at all times.

The last problem is the sexual object problem. I'm a virgin, and I haven't had sex yet. But it's extremely hard when sexy talks/text comes. I would love to lose my virginity to a great girl, but I wouldn't know how to look at her sexy. Like I don't want to hurt her, or not satisfy her needs. Obviously a girl would think I'm physically attractive to sex with, but she'll definitely have a hard time trying to get me all sexual and dirty talk. I just don't want to a object her, and make her feel less human.

I feel like we share the same values and we can sometimes have good conversations, but the chemistry doesn't feel like it's there (he has told me he doesn't want to try romance with someone until he is sure. We met on a dating site), I don't want to take care of another partner like I did with my ex, and it's growing to be uncomfortable af with having my sibling involved because he will ask them questions on how our dates went instead of just talking to me.

Been messaging a guy who’s 30, I’m 24, for just over a week, planning on meeting him for the first time tomorrow for a drink. 
He sends me these messages:

do you ever wear a nice tight fitting skirt or dress? Coz that's what is in my head 
are you working today in a tight fitting skirt or dress and heels?

Haven’t even been on a first date. I asked him if he’s just looking for a good time because it’s a tad uncomfortable, he said no he wants to get to know me and see where things go.

My name is Rejoice Molaodi and I am a masters student at the University of Strathclyde. I am currently looking for research participants to be interviewed for my dissertation project and wondered if any of you would be interested?

My dissertation is on women's experiences of sharing information when using online dating sites, their experiences with unintentionally revealing information about themselves and/or experiences where they believe a potential date had accidently revealed information about themselves before meeting face-to-face. 

**I am looking to interview heterosexual women aged 18 or older who have at least 1 months experience of using online dating sites.**

If this sounds like you and you would be interested in being interviewed, or if you know anyone who would be a good fit for this research, please email me at: [rejoice.molaodi.2020@uni.strath.ac.uk](mailto:rejoice.molaodi.2020@uni.strath.ac.uk)

Interviews will be held online, will last no more than 1 hour and no personal or identifying information about you will be recorded and included in this study.

Each participant will receive a £5/$5 online gift card to a store of their choice.

We had been talking for like a little over a month and a half basically everyday. (i’m 100% sure he’s not a catfish, some of the people i know from the college i’m going to know him personally and we talk on snapchat so he sent me live pics and videos.)

He seemed very interested in me and i was very interested in him and over time as we started to get to know eachother more i began to feel really fond of our conversations so i knew i wanted to start advancing past snapchat messaging. So casually one day we get into a conversation about how his english was really good and i ask him can he show me what his accent sounds like (as a way to warm up to possibly calling) and he’s like “meh maybe later” and at the moment i assumed he was just shy.

But then yesterday i just started to think if he can’t even show me his voice why would he actually want to go on dates with me when i get to spain? Then i’ll have wasted 4 months talking to a bluff. So after i got his daily message today i told him not to send me messages anymore because i don’t want to get anymore attached and the whole text only thing doesn’t feel right. To which he replied “ok i’ll stop then” and i said thanks and he said “yeah sure”

Now i just feel sad because i spent so much time talking to him and i feel like we really did have a bond even if it was just a fake text one. Which is why i wanted to start warming up to a skype call by asking him to show me his voice. But his response and actions showed me that i think he liked me but wasn’t looking for anything beyond a text buddy. I feel guilty and keep thinking maybe i should’ve just told him straight up call me or leave me alone but if he wanted to he would’ve said so when i mentioned texting not feeling right, right?

Most apps you sign up to after a few hours show you that a person likes you, but you cannot see their profile until you buy a subscription service.



These days im not a sucker, but from my experience a few years ago all they do is show you a fake profile, or a random person who hadn't even seen your profile to begin with. 


I recently signed up to Badoo,  and guess what? After 2 minutes of using the app someone liked my profile but I need a subscription to see who it was? No thanks. 



This kind of crap preying on the mentally vulnerable should be against ToS of the app or play store, but I doubt anyone has gathered enough evidence to submit a report.

Badoo,
Tinder,

OkCupid.

Next day i texted saying it was nice and would like to see him again. He replied next morning after asking how my day was, i replied, asked him a question back and he just didnt respond- so im stuck feeling like id been ghosted.

Today he replies to an insta story, we chat, i say i took his inconsistency as lack of interest, he said no its been a bad week and he enjoyed the date, i said yh same so i felt uncomfortable that i was ignored, he said he didnt mean to make me feel that way and some stuff about my body, i said hes hard to read as hes lovely on the date but flaked on me twice and left me on read.
