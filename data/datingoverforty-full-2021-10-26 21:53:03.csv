I think he's in a panic -- about to get ""everything he thought he wanted"" as he turns 36 next month. 

He is moving up the corporate ladder and is in our organization's formal executive training program.  This has resulted in him moving cities three times, once before we met, once to my city, and once to his current. He will be officially qualified for the next step up at the beginning of 2023, but could move up next year with provisions. He's contracted in his current role until mid-2024.

I have the opportunity to move to his current city next year; we've discussed living together. 

Yesterday, he forwarded me an internal communication which said the company is very likely to move me there when our fiscal 2022 begins.

Today, he was told that there is an open pool for the next up executive position *at his current workplace*. Yes, that's the one where I would be transferring. 

Now, he's being weird.   
Says that he'll leave the company if they don't promote him into this specific spot. Says he'll move to another country for better employment opportunities. No mention of our relationship. When we spent a week together in the beginning of October, he expressed concern about his future as he ""approaches 40"" -- he would like to change companies and countries, but ""doesn't know what to do about me.""

I'm taking it slowly -- it's been less than 6 hours-- and letting him vent about workplace issues. Asking him about his corporate future. NOT mentioning me or us.

Most have a lot of experience OLD, so we talk frequently about expectations and experiences. The topic of women's profiles came up and I thought I'd throw these to a broader audience.

1. I Like You! Now leave me alone.

The first that came up, and this was pretty universal among the men's experience with women on multiple apps, is when women will like, match or send you a heart/flower/whatever token and then not initiate a conversation, or respond to one. It's rampant, certainly has been with my experiences. It seems to not matter how you respond, whether short and friendly or witty and thoughtful. For most of us, all of our success has been reaching out because the women who are (otherwise attractive to us or interesting) that do send us a signal then never reply. It's baffling to men, because the signal says ""I like you, talk to me"", but that's clearly not what women are wanting. What would be the rationale for going out of your way to match or send a positive signal to a person you don't want to talk to? I can't imagine doing this. Even if I had many more interesting prospects, I'd still at least entertain this person who I invited....obviously I was interested enough to match. If I didn't want to talk to them, I'd NEVER send a like, heart, swipe, etc. One friend suggested these are the same people who message for sale boards and ask the people if the item is ""still available"" but don't respond or buy it.

2. I am nobody.

The second behavior we find baffling with women is how many have no bio or profile info whatsoever, or so sparse that it borders on comical. ""Describe yourself: Fun"". One word? I mean, even if that was accurate, you're just fun? Divorced? Kids? LTR or a hookup? Smoker? Serial Killer? Anything at all would be more helpful than ""fun"". If you're only going to use one word, try ""Lazy"". I've heard the rationale for this to be that men don't read the profiles anyway - but that's a terrible excuse. First of all, it's not true...not even close. The men you should be avoiding don't read them. Me and all my friends read the profiles down to the letter...clearly some men do. But, if you think no one does then you've eliminated the possibility of it working as intended by doing nothing. You took your best filter and disposed of it. And, you've also created ZERO filters for your profile that are useful and are bringing the whole opposite gender into your pasture based on nothing but photos. For me, I'll tell you, that an empty profile says ""just here for casual"" or ""too lazy/indifferent to care"", and both eliminate any possibility that I'm going to reach out or respond favorably. That was consistent with all my single guy friends too. Is there some other possibility that I'm not considering? I'm at a loss to understand why you'd want to reduce yourself to a photo-only advertisement if you were looking for compatibility, even casual...but certainly for a relationship wouldn't you want the most surface level description of yourself and your aim with a partner?

3. Pictures of your kids...especially adolescent or teenage girls.

Oof. This was a hot button issue as ALL of our female friends had pictures of their kids in their profiles, but the men were unanimous that this was a bad idea across a spectrum of opinions, from safety (advertising your kids via YOU as an avenue to be around them to dangerous men), to consent issues (kids don't get to choose to be part of the profile), to just being a general offputting part of the dating profile. I think most of us agreed that if a woman has children and they're an integral part of their lives  and it's wise to say this or even relate how many children, ages, or relate how much you enjoy being a mother etc., but the pictures were not a helpful thing and potentially turns men off. One of the group says he takes it as a red flag that she's not thinking very clearly about her kids by putting them in this role. I'm not sure I think that strongly, but I definitely would NOT put my children in my profile and never have. That's for after I meet and vet someone, never to a general public audience. Thoughts on this?

It isn’t easy even if you’re the dumper. I’m feeling, so, so tired. Put on some of my favourite perfume, some Air album, laying in bed typing out a rant at 2am.

Ever since the divorce, I’ve been “lucky”, being able to be in relationships every year. I’ve grown, I’ve healed and learned so much, I feel like a different person now compared to my 20’s especially. I feel like I could write a book about romantic relationships and friends around me come to me for advice often when they encounter issues in theirs.

But really, I’d rather be lucky than having had to learn all these lessons in love. All these lessons, experiences came with a price and it feels taxing upon my soul. I’d rather be lucky than “good”, I wish I met my partner for life right off the bat, but instead, I’m circling round and round.

I go through periods of being single, sometimes by choice. Do I feel better then? Sure… but inevitably it creeps in. I want a partner. I desire sex. I have friends but life is feels more alive, more satisfying with a significant other.

Funny enough, most of my partners came into my life when I’m not looking actively for one. It just kinda happens sometimes, I’m out doing things in the world and boom, feels are caught.

But, looking back, I’ve always had to be the one doing most of the work in my relationships. I’m the one that has to confess feelings first (and face rejection, but thankfully at least, if it gets to this stage, I don’t usually get rejected). I’m the one that had to plan most of our dates. Do most of the cooking when we’re staying in. The relationship progresses at the pace that I work towards basically. Isn’t there this quote that says, women are the gatekeepers of sex and men are the gatekeepers of relationships? I’m so feeling it right now and I’m so tired of it. I wish I had partners that put in equal efforts in the relationship, especially in the beginning, the getting-to-know-each-other phase.

From talking to my exes, most of them said that they’ve been interested in me very early on after meeting me. But being the guy I guess, I’m the one that’s expected to make the first moves and more. To be honest, I’m tired of that.

With the most recent ex, I remember how difficult it was to arrange to meet her in the beginning. How I had to be the one to initiate our chats over text, keep the conversation going. What ended up happening was that the first time we met, was after weeks of texting, with us ending up in a hotel room having lots of sex, cuddles and chatting. WTF? If she wants all this, why was it so difficult to even meet for a lunch or dinner first? After we got into a relationship properly, perhaps due to her anxious attachment style, she would hound me on the phone sometimes when she’s feeling insecure, calling me incessantly at night and whatnot. Where was this in the beginning?

I’m so tired of having to “chase”. I’m so tired of trading life stories with people after we begin in a relationship. Maybe it’s because I’ve been in too many? My first serious relationship was when I was 24-27. Second one with the ex wife from 28 till 36. Had a 6 month long relationship at 37. A 3 month long one at 38. A year old one at 39. A strange situationship last year for a few months. A 5 month relationship this year. I don’t think there’s any objective measure to how much is too many, but I feel like I’ve been through enough for one lifetime.

My relationships post-divorce run shorter now because I’ve become more aware of what my deal breakers are. And I wish there aren’t these deal breakers.

From my former marriage, from being in a dead bedroom for years, I learned that sex is important. So that’s the end of two relationships.

I’ve learned that intellectually connecting with my SO is important for me to feel like I’m understood, and maybe, just to feel like I am in love? So no more dating of Sensors (using the MBTI lens of looking at this). So that’s the end of one.

I’ve learned that attachment styles matter, a lot. Insecure attachment stems from childhood neglect or abuse. It can be really tiring, frustrating, to deal with someone else’s demons when you’re also dealing with yours. I thought that I could, I’ve been patient, supportive, tolerant, kind. But, it leaves me feeling stretched, sometimes more parent than boyfriend.  I try my best not to fall into this role, but what else can you do when your girlfriend is having a breakdown through no fault of your own? Even just holding space, offering solace can take a toll. Especially if you’re already a parent. It’s tough being the anchor of support for your child, your lover, and well, myself. I’m trying to keep my own ship sailing too.

Got divorced over a year ago. Wasn't really looking to date. Started talking to this guy who presented himself as sensitive. He went to school with my ex-husband is friends with him. Both of our spouses cheated on us so we bonded over that. Started talking everyday. I knew where this was headed, but I was a little iffy because I'm NC with my ex and I don't want to take a friend away from him. Mr. Sensitive assures me their friendship won't be affected. So we talked for almost four months. Grew closer. We decided to spend Thanksgiving and Christmas together. On Christmas, he is going on a roap trip with him family. I was excited to be invited because to me, this was an indication that this guy really liked me.

The first date was a little lackluster. He seemed a little distant. But I thought he was just being shy. I held his hand a lot, touched him flirtatiously. He didn't recoil, but he wasn't voluntarily trying to be close. My flight back was canceled. He asked me to come back to his house. I refused because I didn't want to be a burden. But there was another cancelation, we were almost at the airport when I decided I was better off spending the night at a hotel. He came to my room. I tried to hug him. He hugged me back. I tried to get him to touch and kiss me. He did touch and kiss me but he was literally only doing what I was asking. So, I stopped and said. I don't want us to do anything you aren't consenting to. So, he says, why do you have to make it awkward! I ended up going down on him. He very voluntarily stripped. I wasn't expecting anything back. He had go back home because his wife was going to drop the kids off early in the morning. I ended up postponing my flight next day. Would have been nice if he had offered to drop me off the airport. But he didn't and I did not ask. I was closer to the airport.

I asked him the next day if everything we did was consensual and he said it was. I said I am still not sure if you like me. Got no straight answer.

A week later, he asked me to come down to watch a movie. Obviously, I got excited. He was still his distant self. Didn't want to kiss. Didn't even hold my hand at the movies. I was scared and holding myself to self sooth. But he didn't hold my hand or put his arm around me.

We ended up having sex after I went down on him.
The whole weekend was pretty the same vibe. Distant.

Later that week I confronted him and said he was giving me mixed signals. I said you don't hold my hand or kiss me. Are we dating? If not, don't waste my time. He pretty much implied I was taking things too seriously. Idk, man, when someone tells me I make them want to be a better person and call me every day, I get the impression we are more than just friends.

I told him later that night I didn't want to go on the road trip with his family. And we should try to be just friends because it seems that what he wants to do.

Called him again after a couple of days. Told him I was struggling but it seemed he felt nothing. He was indifferent. Said I should have gotten attached to an emotionally unavailable guy.

I am kicking myself for being so naive and getting my hopes up. It's like at 40, I am making the same mistakes I made at 20.

Will people often assume spending the night entitles them to sex or do we have to spell everything out?

Continue on to read the following long story and musings, or NOT 😂!!

Recently I had an impromptu 1st weekend w/ a similarly aged man I'd been chatting with a lot.  Although I didn't lay any hard and fast rules down,  there were assumptions made by him regarding intimacy etiquette, sounding a bit contrary to previous chats. I ended up feeling like clear communication and permissions were lacking. It definitely gave me pause to reconsider how I approach this with the next person. Although it's not something I want to repeat,  I realized that if someone isn't savvy or considerate enough to establish mutually acceptable boundaries before making a physical advance, then it's not my job to teach... no harm no foul. C'est la vie, eh? 

My take away  from this unique (or not so unique?) interaction is that this particular person's choice to be poly seems like a way to avoid dealing in strong, clear, healthy boundaries. The personal boundaries he spoke of sounded very one-sided and reactionary, carrying a tone of monogamy aversion and avoidance. He was convinced people in the poly community were super clean regarding STD's; he sounded clueless about actual risks for pregnancy and disease transmission.  He did not seem to explain what he desired in relationship dynamics from an emotionally mature or empathic perspective.

Would you think any expectation exists for me to communicate anything more about how I feel, above average, occasional chatting? 
( Pardon, let's not act intimate again despite my hesitations regarding your over sharing, micro penis, constant assumptions, poor boundaries, and status as a prior sexual abusee.)

He said he spent almost no time alone (outside of a relationship) since a teen. I feel like this is a big red flag. Anyone else agree?

I'm not what I'd consider seriously experienced with dating and I occasionally succumb to bad relationship choices, pre mature, superficial or unstable intimacy. 

IMHO, differing levels of emotional availability and connection exist, so there isn't one gold standard for all interpersonal dynamics. I am working to improve, clarify, and strengthen my boundaries. I feel like I did not get a passing grade... again😂🙄. On the same token I feel like it would make it so much easier to interact with someone that's on a similar level. 

If you've read this far you should get a prize!!!

1.  I was doing a return at Kohls and there's a beautiful woman who I've seen over the years.  I ended up making small talk, she told me her name but I didn't get her number.

2.  The girl at drive thru Wendy's and I were flirting back and forth.  She told me I was to old for her when I asked for her number.  I'll admit I am and was but hey, you never know lol.

3.  I was at Walmart earlier today and I went straight up to this girl and we had small talk.  Got her name and what she's doing tomorrow.  She was shopping for a Halloween outfit for a party tomorrow.  The vibe and connection was going well, then I asked for her number but I was so damn nervous I was holding grocery items in one hand and trying to type her number in the other hand.  I texted her but I must have typed the number in wrong, then again maybe she gave me the wrong number.

Injury just affects my physical movement not mental. The physio program with her was meant to last another year.

Since that time we've got pretty close in the clinic behind closed doors, flirting, hugs, holding hands, kissing. Since we're in strict covid lockdown I've emailed her several times suggesting dates we will go on when lockdown lifts. She doesn't email back (as she doesn't want to leave digital footprint) but seemed interested when I seen her in clinic. At this point she was hinting she prefers I call her than email but I'm a writer so I kept on with emailing.

Lately I went to see another physiotherapist who specializes in brain injury. He said he could liase with my current physio (her) on some additional exercises. I asked her if she was ok with that and she was, but he baited and switched on me, telling her I should be seeing him instead of her. Him being a professor she obliged but told me later it was a kick in the stomach. 

I got pretty upset and told him that was not our agreement and that I would not proceed with it unless  he did what we originally agreed to which was he helps her out with brain injury exercises.

A week later I got an email from her (with her manager in cc) saying it was more appropriate if I go ahead with the professors program as she is not experienced in the field. She said she was happy to see me every 6 weeks just to check-in. It sounded like she took offense that I was trying to control her career by steering her away from what she does into brain injury.

I asked her what about our future plans, to which she replied ""can't because of doctor-patient relationship"". I didn't make a fuss and said showed gratitude for all she has done for me and said goodbye. She still comes up in my thoughts all the time. In a matter of 2 weeks she was gone.

I still have her number and contemplating to call her or delete the number. We no longer have a patient-patient relationship.
