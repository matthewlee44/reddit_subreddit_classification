However lately, he has been messaging me/trying to get my attention when drunk. He can be at an event, clearly drunk, and then try to get my attention by continuing the conversation, or write incoherent questions/call me by name with some internal joke. He also teases me like we're middle schoolers and not in our mid 20s.

We're also in a college Messenger group and whenever I write that I'm attending a student event and going in for tickets, he messages me as fast as possible asking me to get him tickets. 

For example last week, he messaged me to get him tickets for an event and I was like are you going? He was like yeah, I want to go with you and the others. And then a minute later he was like damn I can't, I'm working that date. Despite him already knowing the date?? It was like he just asking me to see my reaction or something. I've also noticed his friend acting weird whenever I'm around, smiling/smirking and there's a vibe in the air like he knows something I don't know.

I was mortified to say the least and even went to therapy and decided to move on from this messy situation although I kinda liked this guy I was dating. He reached out a few days after that happened with a pasive aggressive message to let me know he knows everything but acted like everything is cool and he's not hurt. I was devastated.

Month and a half later (last Friday) I accidentely ran into him in a club. He hugged me and we had a friendly talk. I decided to apologize to him in person and explain everything that happened the night I drunkenly ended up with the other guy. At first he reacted again like everything is fine but eventually became irritated with the subject and said he really doesn't want to hear the details of that story. We changed the subject and an hour later started making out and talked about how we kinda missed eachother. One thing led to another and he ended up spending the night at my place. It was very passionate and romantic. He was very cuddly which he normally isn't. We didn't talk about our future though because it was all surreal.

I always have the mentality in my life that if something can happen it will. The way I'm wired has brought alot of anxieties in many areas such as chemicals... I will think about the toxins that get leached into plastic water bottle , the dyes in our clothes , working on cars I worry about all the carcinogenic fluids , etc....

Now when it comes to dating the one thing that has crippled me has been the fear of contracting cold sores. I don't have them (yes I know I may have them but don't know ,but as far as I know I don't ). 

You can get them even when they are not visible on the person you are kissing. I've tried to just go for it and not think about it but it brings me alot of stress an anxiety. I can't enjoy myself at all. 

Yes, it. May not be a big deal and be seen as a pimple ..but for me and my mind it isn't . I don't know how bad I will get it . I would be worried 24/7 that I'm shedding it and  reinfecting myself on other parts of my body if I got it  ( if it may happen it will In my mind) .

So I hooked up with a girl for the second time last Wednesday, please see the previous thread on top. Invited her back to my place, I cooked her dinner. We got to know each other, we were cuddling as we watched a Christmas movie. I said let's take a walk to digest and she said she would love that. She mentioned several things about how she is not good of a texter due to her ADHD, told me about her friends. We held hands as we took a walk and she kept bumping into me, her shoulders/waist sliding against me, and she would sometimes strengthen the grip.

After we hooked up at my place, plenty of kissing, cuddling, she said she really liked my hair and massaged me. We slept together with her cuddling with me, and had morning sex. I sort of got a little too excited and gave her a few hickeys and she texted me, ""holy! it's so dark! you're banned from my neck.""

I replied to her text and told her to have a good day at work but she didn't reply.

She sent me a snap of her hiding her hair and I replied to that and she didn't respond.

We don't really text or call, although I would like to. We also haven't discussed what this is, although I'm going to bring it up next time I see her. I called her last night at around 9, (she told me she goes to sleep at midnight,) but she didn't pick up the phone.

I'm thinking maybe I'm just being too pushy? Thing is I got the vibe she was really into me, and I really do enjoy her company.

What should I do? Should I just shoot her another text later today and see if she wants to hang out again? I'd love to take her out on an actual date or hang out with her again.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1127013,public,self,Second night with a girl I really like spending with - please help?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qv9mk9/second_night_with_a_girl_i_really_like_spending/,no_ads,0,,,

I’m still technically not “supposed to know” but a mutual friend who she confided in told me because he’s a real one.

I was well on the way to recovering and getting back out there. I was just waiting for the last piece to fall into place which was her leaving my house, so I could fully move on. When I found out the real reason we “amicably” broke up, I was mentally destroyed and have been spiraling ever since. I was gaslit, told this was coming for a long time, and that we’ll both be happier this way.

I’ve still not gotten better. I go to bars alone, get hit on, rebuff any affection because they’re held to an impossible standard, I crush over people I have no shot at on purpose to feel something. Conversations on dating apps go no where because I can’t flirt anymore. It’s miserable honestly.

We met through an app, she was a slow texter (one message every night, sometimes not even that) so I asked her on a date and she agreed.

First date was okay. She was 10 minutes late (no text to say she would be), but she was great. Incredibly opinionated on anything and everything that it threw me off how fast she responded and functioned in general. Conversational, personal, clearly put a lot of time into her appearance, and she extended our date so we could walk and get dessert. We hugged goodbye, and that was that.

Second date, felt incredibly off. She did not seem happy to see me, was a few minutes late, and she did not put much effort in her appearance. The night was alright but it felt like she didn't like me at all. I ended up asking her if she wanted to go on a third date and she lit up and said yes so happily that I was taken aback. She later explained she was not an emotional person. Hug goodbye, did not feel comfortable kissing her, and that was that.

Third date was horrid. 15 minutes late with no text (I thought I was stood up). She was emotionless, felt very cold (more than usual), zero effort in appearance, and kept giving me a forced smile when I would stare at her. Claimed she could only stay an hour or so because of schoolwork (one grad class) and she had a male friend drive over from a nearby city last night to take her to dinner so she couldn't do it then. She kept speaking to me like I was an idiot when I couldn't answer questions about alcohol (I don't drink often) or didn't hold opinions on random things.  Asked me to ask her questions but never returned them.

She claimed she was never wrong, did not want kids because she was selfish, and kept asking me why I didn't know certain thing she knew. Hell, she even got irritated with me because I wanted to get a cat and then eventually a puppy....she claimed the puppy would kill the cat and I was being irresponsible. Any rebuttal I made was met with an eye-roll and more condescending lecturing. And every topic felt that way. Her opinions were never wrong and I refused to argue with her...it's as if she wanted me to argue with her. 

When I asked her what she wanted in a partner, she said ""I want someone who is my equal, who doesn't bend the knee to me"". At that point I became terrible company and just let the date become awkward with dumb questions and silence.

Ironically enough she offered to walk around for 15 minutes through the nearby shops to extend our date (despite me feeling that we both wanted to be nowhere near each other).

We haven't texted or spoken since then (mutual ghost). She rarely texted regardless.

She seemed to be her more genuine self during the last two dates, and I think the first date was just a mask of sorts. I just remember feeling something was off on that first date despite having a good time.

Very disappointing since we had a lot in common (family issues) that makes me feel alienated from most people. If she didn't come off so cold (intentionally or not), i would've been interested in trying to understand her and give it a shot.

For some context, I matched with this girl on hinge once and then on tinder. We quickly realised we had plenty in common, and when we eventually met up, we realised we had A LOT in common (we went to the same high school (we had the same struggles in high school as well), studied the same major, have similar taste in books, literature, movies, et cetera). We've met up twice, and on both occasions afterwards, I would say that I had a good time and she would agree that she had a lot of fun as well. 

I believe we've got a bit of a connection. When we would be cracking jokes, we would be finishing each other's jokes. We've got a similar pool of weird references (vine, movies, songs) which keep on popping up. There are some personal things we sort of see eye to eye on. I don't know in what direction it's going to go, but I'm not trying to worry too much about that. I'm just sort of living in the moment and just enjoying the time. We both work in the same city, but in different areas so unless there is a formal request, the chances are slim that we would bump into each other. We've been texting, but it's totally scattered because we're both very bad texters. (we even spoke about it, and shared a few jokes over it)

Here is where my anxious mind kicks in; I took the initiative to meet up on two occasions in a row. I really want to see her again, but i'm overthinking if i'm being too forward going already. If we had the same classes or had more frequent bumping into one another, I could easily get a feel of the situation. If I should back off or if she doesn't mind. But because it's text-based, my usual way of sensing her is thrown off.

We have talked to eachother continuously since then except when we just couldn't cuz of any personal reasons. We used to play games together and talk about anime/shows.

Days passed and after like 5 months one day i finally gathered enough courage to confess knowing there's literally no future together considering the distance between us. We talked about it and how edating just doesn't work and stuff and we were back to normal , like back to being friends. 
We are super close now(3 years almost), like there are stuff about me that only she knows and vice versa. I suppressed my feelings for her cause i didn't wanna ruin our friendship trying to edate.
Now the problem is , I know this been happening since a while now but i have ignored it till now but its to the point where i just cant. It feels like she only messages when its convenient for her. Like when she's bored or have some shit going on with her.
Like she would ignore my messages for 6 hours straight and only reply when she's ""bored"" or got nothing better to do. 
Sometimes i just feel like i deserve better than that , considering I've been there for her everytime she's needed me. But whenever i want to talk to her she's not really interested. I do very much respect her but when she acts like this i just feel like blocking her and moving on with life. But again i dont wanna stop associating with her ever.

This will skew reality and his ability to accurately assess if she has the characteristics he truly wants.

This often comes from a mindset of scarcity, while confusing love and lust. Men are visually driven, so when we see someone we’re attracted to physically, we will often assume she is someone we want to be with, before getting to know her at all. 

Men and women are different in this regard. A woman can have a high level of physical attraction to a guy, but if he fails to properly engage her emotions, she will begin the phase him out.

It’s not easy. Having true chemistry with someone isn’t an everyday occurrence; but that doesn’t mean it has to be once in lifetime, or even a infrequent occurrence—if you are a developed, dynamic person. We want to hold onto what we desire. It seems counterintuitive, but this approach almost always leads to failure.

Your only objectives in the early stages of dating are to have fun, get to know the person, and have sex. Additionally, date other people and keep your options open. This is a safeguard against neediness.

Things will develop if both people involved want a relationship. Trying to force things, or putting the other person on a pedestal with unrealistic expectations sets a imbalanced dynamic from the very beginning.

Haven’t met his family because his family  doesn’t want him to be with anyone but the baby mother, so we’re holding off on that. (His family knows about me,mostly just my name. but we just haven’t met because he doesn’t want me to feel uncomfortable or unwelcome)

We go on dates, text everyday or call.

I honestly feel like we’re out of the honeymoon phase now.

We’ve both told eachother “I love you” and opened up to eachother about a lot In the past few months.

He always talks about “our future” like… marriage and living together and things he wants to do in the future with me.

He sometimes refers to me as his “wife” or babe(we don’t use those endearments much as they are kinda cringe)

In Reddit post I refer to him as my boyfriend… but in actuality he never actually asked me out.

My family loves him.

I don’t know if it’s just me but I overthink everything and it’s honestly annoying.

I need to know exactly what we are. I know some people just end up in relationships without actually saying “want to be my gf/bf”

But I feel like I actually need him to ask me. Maybe i sound immature but it just provides me with clarity.

I guess I like commitment. If I’m not committed to him I won’t be loyal to him I guess?

I don’t know how to go about this because in my mind I think he thinks that we’re together. 

Which we might as well be but no one asked anything.

I want to talk to him about it but I don’t want to;
A- push him away by making him feel forced to now ask me out.

B-I ask him out instead and end up being rejected.(also I’m “old fashion” I like being pursued, so I probably won’t ask him out) I’ve asked him out on dates plenty so that not what I’m talking about for clarity

C- him telling me he’s not ready or something and then I have to end up cutting him off(or continuing an open friendship) even though I really do love him

I've (26F) been talking to this guy (30M) for a total of 5 months (4 months consisted of being in a harsh lockdown so we were on the phone for 2 hours every other day with consistent messaging) and we've been on about 4 dates over the past month. He basically initiated all 4 dates but I chose where we went for our last date.

After our last date (which was a Thursday night), we continued messaging/banter (which included him saying we need to go a museum for our next date) until Saturday. I stopped replying on that day (both on messages and insta) because there wasn't anything for me to respond to.

It's now Tuesday and I hadn't heard from him at all (which is slightly weird as we don't text all day but it is still somewhat consistent) so I messaged him if he was free for a call - he replied within the hour and said sure. I called and asked how he's going and that I was checking in on him, saying I felt like maybe the vibes were off because he would normally call me. He immediately joked/lie and said he was gonna call you but that I seemed busy (referring to an Insta story I put up of being out to eat earlier that day) and then he said ""truthfully, I am so exhausted from work. I'm sleeping badly and get poor quality sleep etc."" He then went on to ask if I was alright and what's wrong. I said nothing at all and said I'd let him go if he's tired. He said ""we never normally just have 10 minute phone calls but that if I need to go, that's fine"" I just said no I'd end the convo there and that should get some rest after working out (he was at the gym) and to feel better.

He messaged me about 5 minutes later asking if I was alright and I responded saying ""yes, just wanted to check in on you :)"" and he replied ""okay good"".

For context, apart from 4 phone calls I made including the one above, he has always called me throughout the past 5 months. 

So I don't know why but I guess from his ""I'm busy"" reason (he rarely says he's busy to me), the overall tone of the convo that I really can't explain and my clinginess that I showed by calling him to 'check in on him' - I'm worried I'm about to get ghosted ... or at least he's going to slowly fade. 

Any advice on how to deal with the slow fade out without acting on my paranoia/clinginess? Just not sure how to deal with this and I really don't want to get hurt.

I've (20m) been dealing with this girl (20f) from my hometown for about 4 years now. We started talking about being in a relationship during senior year of highschool, but she picked one of her coworkers (a notorious cheater in our school) over me when I confessed my love to her. As the years go by, she gets played by several ""toxic"" guys (by her own words) and goes down a road of self destruction (drinking, smoking, random piercings, etc). I joined the military after highschool, and we've always kept in touch since then. Every now and then, she'd tell me how she regretted not getting with me in highschool and how nice i've always been to her. She's always been cool to me, and she's one of the only women that I talk to at this point (I don't have a lot going on dating wise). I've always had feelings for her, but we've never really made it past the ""flirty friends"" stage. After a while, my feelings for her started to die off. 

Last weekend, I drove home to see the family and I eneded up hanging out with her again. We slept together, and she's now the second girl I've ever been with. I thought my feelings had dwindled since we left highschool, but I guess I was wrong. We were supposed to hang out the next day, but she flaked (she has a history of flaking when we plan to hang out). I was only in town for 3 days, so we didn't get to hang out again. That day before i left town, I decided to tell her how I felt. I told her that I loved her with every fiber of my being in front of her doorstep, and she said she always knew. However, I realized that being in a relationship with her is unrealistic, and after everything, I wasn't sure if I could keep being her ""flirty friend"" whose always there for her when she makes bad decisions. We kissed one last time, and i left town immediately after. Part of me wants to continue dealing with her and have a casual FWB situation for when I come back home. However, I know myself, and I'm not sure if I can do something like that.

Like it happened with this girl, I have met once. She was 19 and she wanted to register on a dating site to find love. She told me her story and I felt so pity for her!

She told me that her parents had a USSR vision of life. They were convinced that a girl must get married at 18 and not later. They even picked a guy for her. They said she must have a first child by 20, otherwise she will be counted as SPINSTER! Of course Lina did not want to marry SOME GUY, who her parents picked for her! Who she even did not LOVE!

They had a fight and her father put an ultimatum. She rather marries that guy or leaves his house. Guess which one she picked? Yep! She left! 

She cried, screamed, she were hysterical, she had suicidal thoughts but.... she was suggested to go into a church. There was a convent in her city where only nuns lived. And they welcomed her there. She got a duty list and a room.  She told me that she felt very lonely there because all the nuns are much older! But she at least has a home there and a food. 

So this was basically her reason of joining the dating website. She asked me if she should write her true life story in an ""about me"" section. I said YES! Did I give her a good advice? would such a truth scare people away of her profile??

Oh yes, she is still searching so the story is not over yet :)",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1127042,public,self,KICKED OUT OF HOME AT 18!,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qveq88/kicked_out_of_home_at_18/,no_ads,0,,,

We talk a lot and have thus far kept things juuuust this side of professional (it's taboo at the moment to date because of the circumstances - work stuff and specific university rules - but it won't be after the semester is done). We have tons in common, and he regularly shifts the topics of conversation when he talks to me from our class to more personal stuff, like what my hobbies and interests are and what my life goals are. He also keeps volunteering information about himself and his life, his background, his interests, his plans, and his favorite books and music (and recommending them to me). I'm the only one in our group he does this with, it seems. I mean, it's mostly just us two when we're together, honestly, so I guess I don't see him around enough other girls to compare the interactions. He also tends to get extremely close when he talks to me, leans in a lot, and gets really animated when I'm around.  

He asked me to meet up after the semester is over so that he could give me some ""pointers"" on something vaguely school-related. I'm interested in doing research on x not necessarily for my degree, and he has some experience with x, so now he wants to answer all my questions and keeps volunteering to help me with ""whatever \[I\] need"" after the semester is over. It's not just that he wants to help, but he wants to meet up in person to help. This seems to have finally crossed the line into ""I'm not just spending time with you because I have to; I actually *want* to engage with you outside the confines of the university"". But I could be misinterpreting and he might just be nice?

Because of the professional limitations this semester, it's really hard to differentiate flirtations from friendliness. Like, we are full-stop not allowed to date in our current positions, which end in December. But that goes away in a month, and it seems like the closer we get to the end of the semester, the more intense this stuff seems to be getting. I really don't know how to read it. Obviously, I want him to be interested because I am. But he could just be really nice, I don't know.

I'm not bad with girls at all, I go out often and hookup with girls on a regular basis, I have many friends who are attractive but just haven't sparked any interest for to pursue whatsoever.

Every time I hookup with a girl I have no motivation to make further plans to get to know her to see if I can see myself building a relationship with this particular girl. Many of my friends have gotten feelings for me or there is clear chemistry but I just cannot do something about it. I have always been this way and it has not bothered me the slightest, but suddenly I feel a crippling loneliness destroying me from the inside.

I have a lot going for me, I do very well at university, I'm not unattractive, I am very fit and I feel that I do very well in social situations and people seem to be drawn to me. For some reason I just cannot find connections with anyone on a romantic level. I have reached the point where I have too many female friends because I have some kind of friendzoning midas touch or some shit...

My brain looks for turn offs in any girl and for some reason expands on that shit until it is the only thing that matters and it is now ruining my life. I have started withdrawing myself socially to improve and compensate for this by studying and exercising like a fucking demon, but I know I am just doing this to mute my insecurities.

Now my life has changed, I am withdrawn, most girls know that I don't want anything intimate because my community is pretty small, so now I started hooking up with my sister's age group and I am now classified as the guy who has been with all the younger girls.

Fuck. I am 21 years old and I have no idea how to develop a relationship, I have unconsciously set the bar way too high for any possible candidate and I hate it, I don't want it, how do I fix this; please, any advice would be much appreciated.

I 'm not introverted, I'm social, funny and generally I treat people as best as I can without expecting nothing in return. I always make people laugh and make a good environment around me, I also read a lot and I'm interested in videogames, cinema etc. Girls I expressed desire for always rejected me(happened 3 times),while others blatantly told me, I don't know what to do. This is so depressing...
