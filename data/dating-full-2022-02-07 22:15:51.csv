We broke up some time in December, but it hadn't really felt like it since we continued to hang out and talk every day and we would still cuddle and fuck. I'm the one who broke up with her. 

But then, after almost a month of this, I realized I didn't want to be broken up, and asked her to just officially be back together. After a couple of days of thinking about it she told me all of these wonderful things about me, and then said, ""but..."" And gave me this ""we're not compatible"" speech, talking about fundamental differences that won't change. 

I was fucking heartbroken. I love this girl so much. I've had such an amazing time with her. And I regret breaking up with her. 

The next month was a lot of me trying really hard to accept that we're just going to be friends. A lot of emotional conversations and crying and her being on dating apps and me feeling bad that she says she loves me, but won't be with me. 

So, Thursday night we're hanging out. Haven't seen each other in a week because she had gotten COVID. Finally able to hang out, and we cuddled all night, then when it was late she invited me to her room and we had an amazing time. Knowing that it was just sex, and that she still didn't want to be in a relationship for me, I lay next to her, naked and feeling sad. We deliberately didn't see each other on Friday because I was trying hard to not hope she might change her mind. Trying hard to just be friends. 

Saturday we hang out all day. She admits that it feels like we're still in a relationship. We go skiing, then a friend of hers comes to town in the evening and we all hang out and have a good time. I plan to spend the night at her place since we're all going skiing Sunday morning, and I ask her, where should I sleep, and she says, ""In my bed."" I'm laying there next to her, feeling ok with being her friend. We cuddle, and I'm ok with just cuddling. I don't expect more. Then she turns toward me and links her legs with mine, and I can feel her breath on my mouth. It's dark, but I can tell she's close. I press my face forward slightly and give her a gentle kiss. She reciprocates and we kiss passionately for awhile. She interlocks her fingers with mine and holds my hand. And it feels so good. We end up having sex, then going to sleep. 

The next morning I ask her, ""Did last night happen because you were horny, or was it because it was me?"" And she fully admits that it's because it was me. And that yes, this is complicated, but reiterates that she doesn't want to be in a relationship. 

We then all go skiing. It's an amazing day. That night we're all just chilling after having watched a movie, and she's talking with her friend about his dating life and the dating apps, and goes to show him her profile. I'm fine with all of this, because I'm trying really hard to think of her as my friend, not as my girlfriend. But then she opens up Hinge and starts to look at guys' profiles with me sitting right there on the same couch. She's listening to their audio prompts and her and her friend are commenting on them and I can't fucking take it. 

I abruptly say, ""I'm gonna go"" and then explain further, ""I can't be here while you look at dating profiles. It makes me really uncomfortable and I need to go"" and I start to gather my things to leave. She never once apologizes or asks me to stay or tries to talk to me. And it hurts so bad. 

I leave and then, sitting in my car, crying, I message her, ""That was so incredibly hurtful"" then drive home. 20 minutes later I finally get a text from her apologizing, but she clearly didn't understand why I was hurt. 

We have a brief text conversation where I explain and she apologizes more. But this morning I woke up and still felt terrible. I couldn't get out of bed or go to work. I ended up clocking in 1.5 hours late. 

I called her this afternoon on my lunch break to tell her we can't be intimate anymore unless she wants something more. She again tells me she doesn't want more with me. I tell her I understand and end the call. 

Since then, I've been crying in my bed. I couldn't manage to go back to work. I ended up asking my boss if I can take the rest of today and tomorrow off and he agrees. 

About 2 hours ago I finally messaged her that I need to take a break from seeing her, and that I don't think I can go skiing with her and her friend on Wednesday as originally planned. I message her all of these tying up loose ends things, and she finally responds that all of that makes her really sad, but she understands and hopes she can see me again someday soon. 

And now I can't stop crying. I'm so fucking sad. It feels like this is finally really over and I know it's for the best, because trying to be her friend while still in love with her was wrecking me.

Over the years, I've come to realize how much the abuse has impacted her. I try very hard to be honest in all of my dealings in general, but I will lie to people I don't respect in order to get something I want.

Case and point: The company I work for arbitrarily decided to send everyone back in office (hybrid) after about a month of being completely working from home. The truth of the matter is I work some days in office and others at home, while my job duties are neither improved or impeded by me working in office or at home. I genuinely have no duties that cannot be executed in home. Therefore, I just want to work from home, especially since I already do so for part of the week. My boss is a decent person but very black and white: 'The rules are currently in office X days and WFH X days per week unless you have an extenuating circumstance.' I don't have a 'valid' reason; I really just don't want to waste time commuting and paying more for fuel.

Just today I messaged my boss and asked if I can get accommodation and work from home. Stating that I live with an immuno-compromised individual and don't want to risk their health by being in office and that my grandfather was just diagnosed with Alzheimer's. I would need to sell my car to raise funds to help support him financially, therefore, coming to work would just be too costly because Lyft would charge $40/day just so I can be in office and do the same work I would be doing at home.

 Let me clarify: We do live with an immunocompromised person and genuinely do try to be safer with COVID, minimizing risks where we can. My grandpa did just get diagnosed with Alzheimer's but the lie is that I do not need to sell my car. I lied about that because 'I don't feel comfortable coming in because of COVID' isn't a ""valid"" excuse my employer recognizes; I lied to strengthen my case to get what I want.

I just opened up and told my SO about this and her reaction was to be angry at me for making her uncomfortable. I told her the truth because I am stressed and frustrated with my employer. Yet, since she doesn't like the lie about selling my car, she starts berating me. Then, because of her abuse, she starts to assume that if I lied to my employer, I must be lying to her. Not about anything specific, but there must be SOMETHING I am lying about...

This is always her line of reasoning when we disagree. 'You did X thing that made me worry and rather than express this calmly, I am going to be mad at you for opening up to me and twist it into how I don't trust you.' I don't expect perfection in a relationship like she's never allowed to be upset, but when this is the reaction the majority of times... I start to feel like I'm better off keeping it to myself.

I'll calmly tell her that what I need is for her to express her fear and uncomfortable feelings in a loving way, without becoming irate, but the response to that is typically, 'Stop telling me my feelings are invalid.' This is not what I am saying at all, and I also point that out with no success.

Am I crazy? I feel I am pretty emotionally mature, but her lifelong abuse has stunted her growth in this area. I get that you should not lie to your SO, but that's the thing... I didn't. I lied to my employer and I feel I should be transparent in communicating that to my SO. In turn, my SO should be able to express any negative feelings they have in a way that doesn't make me feel berated.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1157839,public,self,My SO's (3 Years) Default Reaction to Disagreeable News Is Anger At Me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sn3k6z/my_sos_3_years_default_reaction_to_disagreeable/,no_ads,0.0,,,

He's a bit of slob when it comes to his living space &amp; personal hygiene. He rarely does laundry but continues to wear the same clothes over and over without washing them. I noticed today that he was wearing the same socks that he wore the day before and that grosses me out enough on it's own, leave alone the fact that I wouldn't put it past him that he'll wear the same socks for more days in a row than that.

His room has trash and old dishes all over the floor and he hasn't hoovered since I've known him so there's so much crumbs and stuff everywhere. When we met 2 weeks in I told him I wouldn't sleep over his house unless he washed his bedding as he hadn't in that time and probably hadn't for a long time before that too.

We went to the gym yesterday and we were saying he would stay over my house after so I told him to bring extra clothes to change into and he didn't want to. I told him he's not getting into my bed with sweaty gym clothes on. It baffles my mind that he even thinks that's okay.

He also just doesn't look after his health. He's been ill 3 times since I've known him and he like has a weird thing with medicine so he rarely takes it, but then constantly complains about how shit he feels or how much pain he's in. We both have a sore throat right now and he was over earlier and I offered him throat spray and he said no. He has throat lozenges at home but he hasn't taken any all day. Yet he keeps complaining to me about how his throat hurts.

He doesn't really eat or drink water either. He seems to only eat like 1 meal a day and that's it. And then he'll usually drink like 1 of some kind of non-water drink.

I feel bad, but it's really turning me off. Especially due to the complaining. It gets so annoying cause I offer him so much advice but he won't do it, and then keeps complaining.

An idea popped up in my head which is what you often see in movies and series. And that is buying girls you don’t know a drink and have them magically come over to thank you. 

Now I know this is just fantasy bs, that can maybe work but is more likely in movies than in real life. Obviously the whole point was to test to see what happens. No reaction is still a reaction.

So I talked to the bar keep (who we know personally) and told him we want to try this, and he found it so amusing he was on board straight away. 

We weren’t expecting anything and didn’t even think it will work and we stood correct. The barkeep gave them the 2 drinks and said: “Complimentary of those 2 gentlemen there.” But we got no reaction and that was the point. Just to see how it work.

Long story short, it doesn’t work. Maybe it didn’t work for us because we didn’t follow up and or we might be ugly and the girls were disgusted by us. But yeah, incase you wonder how it is in real life…there you have it.

Then my ex showed up with the guy she has been dating (presumably) for six years

Then i was like ""Good to see you with the beau tonight"" in good spirits. They made awkward sounds and went quiet on me. I was never corrected that night. It went most of the night like that. I tried to bring up ""How are things with you and your man?"" To be met with an annoyed look and silence.

I later sent some kind of apology saying ""I am going to assume that I was.rocking some kind of boat..I apologize for bringing it up and i wont mention it again"". By text (which is weird, yes, guilty)

She gave it a like. And then shot back a text of ""Lets dance"" (we did).

Her guy left. She then waited a bit. And then she left (they arrived together . .. So i assumed they left together)

A friend of.mine, not aware of anything, was asking me about my ex, assuming my ex arrived with me and was confused why she left with the other guy. So i cleared that up.

She told me it was nothing personal and I was great and set new standards for future dates/men and that I was always so lovely (just giving context, not playing the victim) but she was offered a job today (which didn’t change much re: her situation currentl) but made her re-evaluate her situation.

We’ve now unfollowed each other on Instagram, she explained that she’s not the jealous type but doesn’t want to overanalyse my story and she even unmatched me on the dating app we met - which is what I was planning to do when I downloaded it tonight as we had both deleted apps.

I’ve gone through the 5 Stages, I’ve had my abandonment anxiety breakdown and have spent a lot of time simply just in shock. 

We met off Reddit. Hot and heavy super fast. Instant chemistry, similar pasts, similar interests and overall just got along super super well. She was my first partner, first lover, first everything and looking back that probably led to a lot of my vision being clouded on who she really is. 

I’m a relatively late bloomer at 24 years old. Nothing inherently wrong with me outside some anxiety but I do have some trauma with me in my past. Childhood neglect, 6+ years of grooming/abuse (teens) and a incident in which I was raped. She was the first one to validate my experiences, accept me anyways and show me what love and intimacy was like. Again, clouded vision. I was love bombed HARD. 

My ex has her own traumatic past, abusive relationship history, commitment phobic (“I’m not good at conventional relationships) and a few other things (communication, stonewalling, lack of effort) that were huge red flags looking back. 

She was very avoidant/emotionally unavailable  and her Hot/Cold attitude often times left me feeling like I was fighting for scraps. She’d open up or have a lengthy conversation and then shut down for 3+ days. She very rarely let me in her inner world, almost never initiated/invited to hangouts, stonewalled/silent treated me often, didn’t communicate when she was busy/needed space and often kept me at arms length. 

I tolerated all of this because during our relationship she was constantly telling me how attentive of a partner I was, how listening and good of a lover I was, how I bought her flowers when she was stressed and how she enjoyed every hangout/intimate encounter we had. She said all these things and hit all the right buttons, but my efforts were never reciprocated and I often felt like I wasn’t doing enough. 

I’m starting to see how she devalued me in the process, especially after our first “boundary crossing” talk in our entire 6+ months of dating. I caught her posting a nude to an NSFW sub and was taken completely back/uncomfortable. 

I brought it up cordially later while saying that the nude wasn’t the issue, but not discussing it with me beforehand and posting behind my back in an exclusive relationship was. She apologized, removed it without me asking and said she did it “Just because she felt like it. Wasn’t anything tied to the relationship or being in it. Didn’t reply to any messages or comments because that wasn’t the point. I’m sorry if you don’t understand” (paraphrasing) 

We reconciled, or so I thought, and went our separate ways afterwards. In the weeks that followed her replies became shorter, my affection/Verbal affirmation and love wasn’t reciprocated and things seemed to become tense. 

I eventually could feel something boiling so a week later asked if there was anything on her mind she needed to address and anything I could fix. 

Blindsided with a breakup soon after. The breakup occurred over text, the day after the funeral of a family friend, on the day a personal friend died and 2 days before my first ever apartment move which she knew I was stressed about. 

Her reasoning  was that she felt “extremely under equipped to handle to emotional needs of a relationship”, that she just wanted to be alone and didn’t desire any romantic relationship with anyone at all. She also noted “I did nothing wrong” and that she still wanted to be friends because she “cared about me, had fun with me and because I was a good person”.
No communication, no fixing simple things, nothing. 

Yea well, in the 2 weeks that have followed I’ve gotten a friendly reply maybe twice, have been stonewalled again and my friend caught her now on Tinder/Bumble after she said it wasn’t because she needed or wanted anyone else. Guess that feels safer vs deepening emotional intimacy. 

I’m starting to see how she devalued me in the time leading up to the BU. She decided I wasn’t right for her without even giving me a chance to do right. This is from someone who in the weeks before was describing me as “Amazing, worthy, attentive, great in bed, very attractive and that I love you so much” etc etc. 

I just feel very sad I loved someone so much and gave gave gave EVERYTHING , through all the lovebombing and red flags, and she in the end didn’t even value me. 

I never tore her down for a schedule change (multiple times), needing space, being busy with school, her multiple chronic conditions or if she wasn’t feeling up for intimacy. She never took up my offers of support/help, very rarely complimented me unless asked, hardly went out of her way to initiate and often times just left me confused. 

I’m starting to feel like I dated my biggest hater, despite all of her affirming words, and that I was simply a 6 month rebound for healthy intimacy (she said I was once of the first to give her that), companionship and validation. 

I feel used, devalued and gaslit to fuck. 
I was love bombed, idealized, devalued, compartmentalized and now discarded without a second thought. 

Today I reached out, told her how I was feeling and how I couldn’t be the  friend she wanted and support her if all I was going to get was breadcrumbs and feeling like I hardly existed. 

I was honest and stood up for myself for the first time in 6months. I didn’t invalidate her past experiences, chronic conditions, sudden aromantic orientation or anything. 

Still, I refuse to be treated like an option. Especially after she broke every promise she made to me. 

Moving on because I’m deserving of love, care and respect just like everyone else. I have no desire to go out and date right now. I am leading a good life though with a new apartment, debt free, stable (but solitary) job and in good shape. I don’t drink, don’t smoke or party and with the pandemic/winter socialization is rough. Still, If someone walks into my life or I meet someone and we click, I’ll love them unconditionally just like I did her and give them my all. 

I have a lot to work on with my anxiety, setting firmer/more boundaries, recognizing a need for space more (hard if it isn’t communicated!!) and taking it a lil slower. But fuck man, I can’t help feel like I was abused.

So I suggested a FaceTime, which he agreed to. It was a bit awkward and felt more forced but overall fine and at the end he said he would like to see me when I get back. I realized I was putting in way more effort than him, so I decided to not text anymore. Well....5 days have passed and I havent heard from him even though Ive seen hes active on social media.

We lost touch for a while, although I did stay in the loop with what he was doing and just wished him well. Couple of months ago, some friends from our group back in the day got in touch about doing a little college reunion. This guy saw that I’d been on the group chat, and sent me some nice messages asking about how I’d been, and whether I’d be going to the reunion.

Well, we carried on messaging and decided that even if the reunion didn’t happen, we’d still meet up. (I’d figured that he must have split up with his ex, as he told me I could crash on his couch if I couldn’t get home from the group drinks, as he lives alone.)

Without going into details, we met up in the end and had a really nice time. A few drinks in and we’d both started spilling about our mutual secret crushes way back when. Kissed. Meeting again this week. So much in common, and so much more to talk about.

I thought I’d given up on dating after the past couple of years, and that this might never happen again.

I usually would not ask for advice, but this past weekend I went to a party with some friends and there has been this girl in my class year that I have been talking to.

I was excited for the party because she kept asking everyday if I was going to go and kept being subtly touchy and flirty throughout the week. When we got to the party though and before I arrived one of my roommates told her and everyone in the small room how I had no experience and was a virgin, and when I got there I became the joke of the party with everyone (including her) poking fun at my inexperience. It made me feel like crap, I was not expecting anything to happen that night but I still fixed up and was all pumped then instantly down.

Hi I’m a women  late thirties living in nyc.  Met a guy online he messaged a few months ago but I didn’t take the bait (gut was onto something) recently felt lonely (I know) hopped back on and we set up a date . I hate long paragraphs so I’ll bullet point it out then summize my findings (rotfl):

We spoke on phone he texted almost immediately after getting number (flag). I didn’t want to face time he said what are you ugly or something I felt pressured we did face time extreeeeeeemely charming (flag) I agreed to date 

Date : upscale fancy dinner in nyc
•led with job... said he had a super fancy job linked in basically suggested clerical work for the same firm (a liar.. lies)
•overly complimentary 
•would ask questions but you could tell he checked out (eyes would glaze)
•relationship history was all brief stints (nothing over 6 months) 
•literally said if I ever cheated on him he would kill me(😳🤯) I know
•drove me home (I know) suuuuuyyper handsy  he claims to be religious (a big show of dietary restrictions ) but the level of handsyness was well versed heathen level rotfl 
•dirty talk... asked me to go home with him I said no 

Next day 

•said he could stop by and we could hangout in his car for 5 mins. I said are you joking he played mock offense and hurt saying how could you think I had bad intentions you’re obsessed with sex (gaslighting)


2nd date. Top steak house basically back to super charming. We did the nytimes 36 questions that lead to love. In car home very handsy I said no he dropped mask abd straight up sulked ride home 

3rd abd final : a spa here with pools he said pack an overnight bag. I realized he’s into stuff that I consider painful and overly aggressive. I said ouch.   spa was good but once to his meh residence it was obvious it wasn’t going to go down he pouted slept int a different room and has been a ghost since.

It was kinda rocky in the middle because he was indecisive about if he wanted to meet up or not because I lived an hour and a half away and I don't have a car but, he expressed that this was truly something he wanted. While we were talking he would kind of insinuate that this could go further.

When we finally met up he took me as his date to his formal and it was great and he even sent a photo of us to his mom (which I thought was a good sign). When he dropped me off I asked if this was a booty call and he said ""no, I had a really good time with you this weekend"" then stated he wanted to see me again.

After he left communication was minimal. I gave the benefit of the doubt because he was truly busy with school which I believe because he was inactive online. I texted him asking to clarify what his intentions were and he replied by stating ""I'm not looking for anything too too serious at the moment but I had a really great weekend with you and I want to see you again"" which confused me because it wasn't consistent with what he was saying and his actions. In the following text, I told him I got Covid and he didn't even ask how I was doing or if I was okay. I left it and let him have his space and yesterday he finally replied back to a snap and we spoke for a bit. Then today I wanted to see if he would care or ask anything if I told him I was having a bad day and I was left on open (even though he used to reply asking if I wanted to talk to make me feel better).

It was the final straw for me because I didn't feel that he cared after we met up and had sex even though he expressed he wanted to see me again. It wasn't this incident alone which pushed me over the edge because I had trust issues with him before because during the rocky period he was really cold towards me and ghosted me for a bit before he decided to see me.

So today I finally decided to block him off Snapchat because I was kinda over the games at this point and didn't want to get hurt. I feel like if he truly cared he would notice or reach out to me because we have each other's numbers, but as of now I'm just tired of it. Comparing how we interacted before in person and before we met, it just felt off. It sucked because he was so inconsistent with his intentions and I really liked him.

Did I make the right move? (I appreciate any input)

We started talking a few weeks ago. When we started talking I think I was too direct and wanted to meet to early. We exchanged some nudes and asked to meet at his place and he said he wanted to know each other more first.

​

I remember wanting to meet him at a concert but we didn't get to meet. Afterwards I saw him doing a live at a club and went there with a friend to see him and I befriended one of his close friends, let's call that friend Y. I told him that I like X because he asked if anyone caught my eye at the club. I am shy and I have rarely went to a club and felt kinda uncomfortable there because I dont like flirting in public. Y told X that I like him, but he refused me and I felt super down and later left the club, he said that I was too shy or something among those lines.

​

Then I watched X while he was doing a live on instagram and he asked me if I wanna come over cuz he and some friends including Y where throwing a party. We drank a bit and played a game of truth and dare and when he was asked by someone if he likes me he refused to answer then I later asked him and said he can just say no and he said he didnt wanna be rude and that he doesnt and I felt bad again cuz I do like him.

​

I asked him in private later why he doesnt like me or if I upset him and he said he is in a bad phase after his break up and he doesnt actually know if he likes me or not. Then I talked about this with Y and he told me to have more attitude him oe something like that and told me that he doesnt want a relationship and he likes to play with people but he would probably want some fun if I sent him some nudes. So I did that (we exchanged before so I thought he wouldnt mind) and first he said ""I like your position 😍"" then later said I am not assumed and asked if I thought I would impress him with nudes and that he isnt just into fun with someone. I said no and that I am sorry if I upset him with that and he told me ""wtf, mature and have some attitude"". I still dont know what the fuck he meant with that. Attitude in what sense? And I thought mature people tell directly if they like someone and not play games so I dont know how he wanted me to act.

​

Then I went again to a party with him and some friends of his because Y invited me. I stayed next to X. He was dares to kiss everyone on the cheek and I feel flustered when he did that to me cuz I like him. Later he was dared to make out with everyone for 10 seconds and when he got to me he did it for a few seconds more (while we making out one of the guys said time's up but he continued to make out and he was dominant while doing it, forcing his tongue in my mouth and honestly that's how I like to be kissed hehe) and was later dared again to make out with me (this time just with me) and he did the same thing again. He was later dared to suck my tongue for 10 seconds and he refused. When it was my turn to dare him I dared him to hug me and he smiled and did it. And later I had to dare him and I asked to stay hugged with him and I stayed in his arms and he didn't mind it. Until then I also cuddle with him cuz he didnt seem to mind, he actually even touched my chest and abdomen and even held my hand. When I chose truth at the beginning of the game he asked me if I had hopes for a relationship with him and I said yes without hesitation. There was alsi this other guy at the party who likes X to and I felt him being jealous while I was hugging X and cuddling with him. Apparently he refused that guy too because he is into a guy who isnt into him. Y said that and pointed out how ironic it is.

​

I am really annoyed that he didnt refuse me directly, after he said he is not into me he later told me that he is just unsure or something like that. Y told me he is apparently into older guys (he had a relationship with a 38 years old guy for 1 year before they broke up 3 months ago) and I look younger than X although I am older. Now I was talking to Y about getting him something for Valentine's Day cuz apparently X is a romantic and I thought I could make him like me. Y told me that I probably shouldnt and get him instead for his birthday in April. I planned to buy him a giant red teddy bear with ""I love you"" written on it cuz it looked super cute although it is quite expensive. I talked with Y again about X and he told me he finds it weird that I like X because I look better, have a body more built cuz I go to gym and a nicer ass (found the last one funny lol) and he told me that X dominated me mentally or something like that and that I should try to do it to him and treat him with indifference and criticise him to make him like me (not my style to do something like that). Yesterday I left to go to my hometown for two weeks so I wont see them again for a while.

​

How should I proceed next? I think he likes me physically because he liked my nudes and liked to cuddle with me and touch me. I planned to work out more and send him some suggestive pics instead of nudes to see how he reacts and plan to get that teddy bear for his birthday. He is a romantic, I am also good at making portrait and wanted to make him one too, do you think he would like that? Any other ideas or help or advice you can give?

Like I find a lot of men do this they have like a 13-year-old or a six month old and they’ll not disclose that and when I asked they won’t say they have kids and then you get on the first date and you’re like a “hey is that a baby in your background” and it’s their kid. 
Like I don’t wanna date somebody with kids but maybe someone else  does and them hiding the fact that they have kids is a massive red flag to me because what else  are they hiding.

I'm a 26(F) who, up until around six months ago, has been pretty much a serial monogamist since I was 20. I've been trying the whole ""casual dating"" thing, but so far it feels like it is absolutely ruining my self confidence. 

I find myself realizing how many guys don't really care at all who I am and just want me for sex. It makes me feel dehumanized and worthless, and also makes me hyper-fixate on my appearance because it's what I sometimes feel is my only value, so if I feel like I'm unattractive I feel as if I have no value at all and it crushes me. 

I don't know if I'm keeping people at a distance because I'm afraid to be vulnerable, or if no one I'd potentially want to date actually wants a deeper connection with me, or both. I know I have to meet different people to find someone compatible, but the process is really wearing on me. I also find myself feeling pressure to sleep with the guys I go on dates with because I feel like that's all they wanted to hang out with me for and I don't want to disappoint them...I'm that desperate for intimacy lol. 

Is there a way to date while also protecting myself and vulnerability? I don't want to burn out as fast as I seem to be right now.

Not sure if this is the right forum, but I’d like to hear your input. I understand equality between men and women is paramount… HOWEVER! If he/she was the one who asked you out or chose the restaurant and invited you etc., do you believe they should foot the bill? 

Will you be offended if the bill comes, they look at you expectantly and ask if you’d like to go Dutch…? 

Personally, if a guy or my current partner had invited me out on a date for dinner or whatnot, I’d assume that he would pay. However, when we are finished, I always suggest an activity afterwards (more drinks at a different bar, a movie, nice dessert etc.) so that I can pay for us and treat him to something fun and exciting, regardless of the cost (basically alternating, or I take turn to pay for the next date, etc) 

I am very used to taking turns paying for stuff with my friends. For example, one of my friends might book a hotel room for a girl’s night (sometimes she’d pay for the entire bill, other times I’d chip in to help out) but I’d pay for dinner, takeaway, drinks, snacks etc.

Did I cross a line here?

Maybe a match every 6 months or so, and even those get about 3 messages deep before I'm either ghosted or the person I've matched with is putting in so little effort that I can't imagine they're that interested.

For a long time, it got me down and really hurt my self-esteem. I started to consider myself ugly (despite nobody ever telling me this) because if hundreds of girls don't want to swipe right on me despite there being no obligation to even talk to me, I must look pretty bad right? Or maybe my profile shows them that I'm a boring person? Whatever it was, I felt (and still feel) very unattractive because of the idea of being implicitly rejected by so many girls over such a long period of time.

When I stop to think about it though, it doesn't make a lot of sense. First of all, looking at myself honestly and without the emotional stuff, I can't pinpoint any one thing about me that is particularly unattractive. Am I above average? Probably not, but I think it's fair to say I'm not below average when it comes to looks either. I've also redone my profile several times, trying to make it better each time. I have several decent photos and a nice bio. I think I present myself pretty well.

What doesn't make sense to me is that out of the hundreds and even thousands of girls I may have swiped on through the years, I can count on one hand the number of girls that swiped back on me. Even just statistically speaking, that low number just seems fishy to me.

This is definitely not some kind of ""woe is me"" self-pitying thing either, so please don't get that impression. I'm genuinely just curious if it's something to do with the algorithms of these apps, the fact that the app developers want you to buy a premium subscription before they show your profile to anyone, maybe that most girls don't take these apps very seriously and they're more for entertainment?

Or am I really that ugly/boring/unattractive/etc?

If anyone has any insight into this, I'd really appreciate it. I'd really like to believe it isn't just some major flaw with me, but I genuinely feel like I don't know at this point.
