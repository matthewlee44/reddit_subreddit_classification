0,r9oiw9,1638735960,When to ask this girl?,"So exactly last week I accidentally called this girl, I apologized for calling her out by accident and she laughed because she didn't get notified for my call, she's from my school, we discussed a bit about our WhatsApp group from our school grade and why she and I don't prefer talking there, and we ended the chat there.

Just about 5 days later she asked me another question saying ""oh sorry I did not answer hahaha but why? Now I'm curious"" I thought we ended the conversation when I said why I didn't like talking in that chat, but I think this shows interest in wanting to talk to me (not in being something, lol, just interested in talking to me). That same day I tried moving the conversation a bit more personal other than our grade, and we ended the chat like this:

Me: ""Hahah, I really like you"" (referring that I like her as a person lol, didn't say it as a way to say that I like her)

Her: ""Me too, hahah""

Me: ""Although I have not spoken to you too many times, you have always seemed a very friendly person""

Basically I ended the chat like this, I actually do like her and I feel that she's someone who matches my vibe and I want to get to know her. Any tips on starting the convo again in a not weird way? I really want to speak to her and get to know her.

I have not seen her since a very long time because of the pandemic, I live in a place where covid is still affecting us and the only way to speak to her is through chat in the moment.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9oiw9/when_to_ask_this_girl/

I should mention I'm beginning to go through (another) depressive episode, and I think it could be blunting my emotions a lot. Also this is my second date ever in my life, my first date ever was about a month ago. (I'm 21F, dating other women/non binaries)

We talked for about a week before meeting, we texted quite a lot. We have quite a few common interests. When I met her we went shopping and then to her apartment. We talked a long time and cooked food. I think I was at their place for like 8 hours talking so pretty fucking long. We had quite a few bust out laughing moments, and even some more serious convo. However it kind of just felt like a friends meeting, well I'm also not sure what a date is supposed to feel like. My previous date also just felt like friends (with a different person)

I also felt incredibly empty, but then again I feel this way all the time, most likely from depression. We were laughing and having conversation but theres just an overlooming nothingness. When I drove home I felt even more empty, and tbh pretty suicidal despite having objectively a good time. I see a lot of people say you're supposed to feel excited to see your date again, and a connection. I dont really feel anything but I'm thinking I might need more time to develop something? My other thought is that depression is making me feel nothing, which is preventing any romantic feelings. Should I just go on a second date to see?

Or are not interested?,"I'm a 21m and I was out in Angel, London last night and to set some background the area is full of bars that become somewhat In-between a club at the end of a night, so the environment is friendly and people are generally more approachable and you can actually talk.  
I was approached by six girls in total, all of whom were dancing with me. The dancing wasn't casual to say the least, there was touching in let's say more intimate places from both parties, one even decided to put her legs on me.  
Yet, when it came to me trying to initiate something further, like going in for a kiss or asking for their numbers, I got a no back with most saying the reason was that they have a boyfriend.  
While I recognise that for some this could be an excuse, it surely couldn't be the case for all of them. So my question why would someone do this if they had a significant other? Or was it possibly something I did that put them off?

For 90 percent of women I see that they doesn‚Äôt want to create/have long term realationships. I have worked on myself too enough, if you will say to me to just chill and work with myself and just take my time.

IF you are seeing someone that has been cheated on, be careful. Get to know them first and see if you are truly compatible with each others desires and tendencies. Watch out for controlling tendencies like looking through your phone, skewed perspective on platonic male/female relationships, and extreme clinginess.

I'm not going to say that everyone whos been cheated is going to be difficult to date, but its possible. This event probably had a huge impact on their life and it could either change them for the better or worse.  He/She can become extremely controlling.

# Personal Story

So this happened a couple years ago. I haven‚Äôt thought about this girl in more than a year now but she came up in conversation recently as I was catching up with a friend.

I dated this girl about 2 years ago. Her ex cheated on her for the last several months of their relationship and this gave her some serious PTSD. Her outlook on life drastically changed and she became super insecure. Now she was already kinda crazy to begin with so the extra insecurity really amplified her natural difficult personality to the point where I was walking on egg shells every day. She also began worshipping this psychology professor Jordan Peterson religiously. He was good at first but now I can't stand listening to him make an argument with 1000 words that can be said in ten words. If you don‚Äôt know who he is... just look at his fan base. It's a cult. 

I met her through tinder. At first, things were great. Though I didn‚Äôt find her that physically attractive (maybe 5.5/10), I swiped right because I kinda knew her through mutual friends and was just going through a break up so I said fuck it why not. We matched and I'd say we connected pretty fast. She was chill (at first lol. more on that later), smart, and career-driven, attributes which I find valuable in a long term partner. I take her on a couple dates to get to know her better and eventually I ask her to be my gf, in which she says yes. At this point, I'm pretty excited. I tell a couple of my friends and show them a pic of my new gf, thinking they'd be excited for me. It was sort of the opposite. Turns out, they knew her or at least heard of her through mutual friends (for the record, we are kinda in this community where everyone knows or knows of each other, one way or another) and she was kind of known for being weird and difficult. Should've been the first sign but hey... I was thinking with the wrong brain. So I said fuck that I don't care.

As we date and spend more time, I'm starting to pick up why my friends had that reaction. Wow she was difficult. TBH, this was years ago and I don't remember the chronological order of the events nor do I remember all of them, but there was a lot. Let me just list out some of the crazy things I remember going through:

1. She was INSANELY adamant that girls and guys CANNOT be just friends. Now at this point in time, I had many female friends. Some I found attractive, some I didn't, but never acted on them. This was probably the number one thing we fought over the most. But check this out. She had a guy friend who she was super close to. Close enough to make those cheesy pacts where if both of them were single at the age of 30, then they marry. It was that kinda close relationship. But, to me this wasn't that bad. I have female friends and honestly didn't feel any type of way about them. I met him once when she invited him over to my apartment (which was normal because we were in college at the time and he happened to live near by) and when he came over, she was all of a sudden super flirty and touchy. Like leaning over and putting her hand on his chest. Wtf??? The hypocrisy... This frustrated me immensely not because I was jealous (still didn't care at this point but I think its because I didn't feel threatened and also no offense she wasn't that much of a catch), but mainly because we fought literally HUNDREDS of times over this notion that guys and girls CANNOT be friends... She pretty much only made that argument when it favored her.
2. She looked through my TEXT MESSAGES. Now this is partly my fault, as I should've had the backbone to not let her step all over me, but at the time, I was immature and weak. She would look for trouble in my phone and go through my text messages with my female friends. 
3. She was FAR from chill. There was this one time we were at a cashier register ready to pay, when she all of a sudden dropped some of the items we were purchasing. I chuckled because it was funny, helped her pick up the items, gave her a half one arm hug, and walked away (bc she was paying) to look at some of the items on the side. Apparently, me not standing by her side is considered un-loyal. So we had a huge argument over that which ended up her kicking me out of her car as she threw all my belongings on to the street. Like who tf gets mad over that? We had a lot of fights on similar pettiness level, all which were started by her. And of course, me being a pushover loser that I was, apologized and allowed myself to be stepped on.
4. I didn't have snapchat, but she did. I never liked taking pictures that much and was for sure not a selfie guy. She guilt tripped me into downloading it and if I didn't reply back to her snaps, she would start a mini-argument. This one isn't THAT bad but damn was it annoying.
5. Another event that I just remembered. This one pretty much happened weekly during my last semester in college. Just about every week, my roommates and I would play poker in our apartment. Usual broke college $5 buy-ins lol. Good times. Anyway, of course, knowing how she required a lot of attention, I would let her know that I would be not on my phone as I'm drinking and gambling with my roommates (3 other dudes btw). I would expect any reasonable adult to understand this and just let me have my peace, but no. Not her. Every time, without fail, in the middle of the game, I pick up my phone to multiple unread messages and missed facetime calls from her. Super fucking annoying that I couldn't have one night to myself and had to cater to her neediness.
6. This ones unrelated to her getting cheated on but I'm going to add it anyway because its just disgusting. She didn't shower after working out... She had a routine of going to the gym in the morning and running a couple miles before heading to class. But she wouldn't shower until the end of the day... wtf bruh. She would literally go straight to class after running miles, drenched in sweat. As the day goes on, the sweat dries so she doesn't feel like she needs to shower right away. I was pretty appalled by this as no one I know to this day shares this thought process. I mean it affected out sex life. Her arms were bumpy with what I think are just clogged glands and her pubic area almost always smelled bad. Couldn't get hard around her unless I was insanely high or haven't had sex/masturbated in several days.

No pun intended but I would describe it as feeing more lubricated. My thinking becomes more clear and conversations flows more smoothly. Physically, im able to push myself more with less stress on my joints and muscles. I attribute this to better sleep that aids recovery. For me, these benefits have help me to become more productive and achieve my goals so I'm not sure if I'm ready to give up this lifestyle yet. I am willing to compromise to having sex a few times a month but I do eventually plan on getting married one day and being fully committed to a partner. 

Im aware that regular sex is an important factor in a relationship and a deal breaker for some, so I would understand if someone would lose interest or even think it was weird. People can make exceptions in long distance relationships or just having different schedules that makes it difficult.

I've been talking to a girl for 3 weeks and we've had 1 date, which went really well. She ticks the vast majority of boxes, however there are a few which are making me a bit anxious. After a decade of dating, I know and accept that nobody is perfect and everyone will have negatives about them. 

Shes a great communicator, good looking / well groomed, has good morals and values, appears to be honest, thoughtful, moderately religious (like myself) and wants the same things in life. So lots of key things ticked. 

The few things I didnt like:
- I feel like sometimes she doesnt get my humour. Sometimes I make a joke and she doesnt get it and asks me to explain. Will she grow to learn this?
- Shes very self-absorbed/self-centered and loves talking about herself. For example, if I ask her 10 questions she will only reciprocate with 1 or 2 back. This suggests she might be a selfish person?

The first date, we went to a pretty exclusive social club that costs $5,000 to be a member of. I wasn‚Äôt aware of this before the date. On it, we had a good conversation, and he kept trying to get me to drink. I didn‚Äôt think much of it, but, by the end, I‚Äôd had five drinks because he kept motioning to the waiter to order more (way more than I would normally have, especially on a first date.) 

We walk back to my car and I am trashed. Like, I don‚Äôt feel safe driving. He makes out with me for several hours, and wants me to go back to his place. I say no, then call an Uber back to my house.

He is really obsessed with me and wants to go out again. I go on a second date. I‚Äôm way more cautious with alcohol and do not let him order me drinks, but I still have THREE (by his encouragement.) He tries to put his jacket on me several times, and I keep saying no, and then he does anyway.

We go back to his apartment, and the lack of food and surplus of alcohol makes me feel extremely dizzy and unwell. I tell him I am drunk. He starts making out with me and tries to perform oral sex on me, which I say no to. I am feeling stressed and upset.

Just as a note, for some lucky reason, even if I have had six drinks (that‚Äôs the most I‚Äôve ever had in my life) and feel like everything is spinning, I am still able to look someone dead in the eye and clearly say ‚ÄúI am too drunk to consent and moving further is rape and I will report you to the police.‚Äù It‚Äôs super weird, but it‚Äôs stopped all misbehavior, as I sound so serious. 

So I tell him ‚ÄúI am too drunk to consent,‚Äù and he kind of stops. I tell him I want to go home. He says I should sleep over. I now feel concerned something will happen to me if I fall asleep, so I call an Uber. He‚Äôs not happy with this.

When I go home, the next morning, I send him a long message detailing the number of things he forced on me and how, if we had had sex, that that would have been assault. I tell him that I think he tries to get girls drunk so he can sleep with them. Then I say that, at his age, he should know better.

I blocked him so I wouldn‚Äôt have to read his response, and it made me feel better. One of my friends told me that I was a jerk for doing that, and that I should have at least left communication lines open so he could learn more from me.

63,r9twur,1638750859,My girlfriends (best) Friend (f23) has been hitting on me (m23). What should I do?,"
Hi, so first of all I‚Äôm new on here and idk 100% how this works but I need some feedback and thought. So for everyone that will take out the time of their day to read it and tell their opinion thanks a lot.

So to start of ill tell you a little back story and put the parts where the weird stuff is happening separate so it‚Äôs easier to read.

So me and my gf have been dating for over four years, I‚Äôve known her for much longer same goes for her friend. In the first 3 years of our relationship we would hang out with her from time to time (she doesn‚Äôt live that close so we usually met up every 3/4 months). In those first 3 years everything was normal and chill the vibes were good but nothing special.

So this last year we have been hanging out together a lot more then we used to do. (once a month sometimes even more) the 3 of us would have sleepovers and it was all good. I would sleep at the outer side of the bed


Because obviously my GF wouldn‚Äôt want me to sleep in the middle. But things changed I noticed that the vibe between me and her friend changed (like I said I will note all the stuff separate down bellow so it‚Äôs easier to read)

But over the last year my GF really changed her way of behaving when it comes to her, as if she knows what‚Äôs happening. She won‚Äôt let us be alone ever, whenever I mention her name I will get a dry response and stuff like that. Them 2 never talked about it with each other but I can tell my GF is very jealous.


- I noticed her friend would look at me and seek eye contact all the time.
- She laughs at all my jokes and is on my side in every argument
- She is always calling me out (‚Äúbullying‚Äù) being annoying. Basically just seeking attention to have convos with me or have a laugh at stupid stuff
- One time we were in the bathroom alone and she was standing next to me with a oversized shirt with no panties on (not nude or anything just a regular sleeping shirt), and we were laughing brushing our teeth and she said something (can‚Äôt remember what) grabbed her panties of the radiator, politely slapped it on my arm, walked away looking back at me and laughing (I was shocked and froze hahaha)
- She told me and my GF (separate) that she‚Äôs into guys who have a girlfriend and that she knows it‚Äôs bad but she likes to play the games (which she is playing with me ig?)
- When I post that I‚Äôm in the gym, on Snapchat she will respond with stuff just to talk to me.
- Last time we were together the 3 of us parted ways and after 10 mins she sends me a stupid snap, also just to talk to me again.

Basically she just want to have contact and have my attention with me (IRL) even if my GF is there. The affection and the connection between me and her is something that is super dangerous.

The things above are just a couple of situations summarized as this has been happening for over a year. There has been much more thing that happened which I either forgot or I‚Äôm not gonna say here cuz it‚Äôs already kinda long and I don‚Äôt wanna stretch it to much.

Point is, I‚Äôm a guy that has a good intuition and I can usually tell when someone people me or not and how the vibes are. But this is different, this is my GFs friend and it feels weird. I want to believe she‚Äôs into me but I also don‚Äôt because it‚Äôs messed up. 

- also she never did anything that went to far or said anything that is like crazy, but I can just tell by the way she acts and behaves and looks at me that she‚Äôs into me (I GUESS) 

Anyway I would like to here u guys opinions on this and how I should handle it and if she actually likes me or am I making things up?

And what do you guys think she wants from me, I am acting kinda cool about it not responding to everything but like I said I‚Äôm not 100% sure if I‚Äôm making stuff up, like usually I know but this situation is different. And I‚Äôm also thinking like, if she‚Äôs into me why wouldn‚Äôt she just tell me or go a step further?

Also I was thinking of contacting her friend in private and just ask her Whatsup and what she wants from me, and also if she has been noticing some weird behaving of my GF to her, because this is having an impact on our relationship. But I‚Äôm scared because I think the affection will be to much and we will do more then just talk..

I know this one guy who on paper seems awful. I don‚Äôt even want to say he‚Äôs my friend because he‚Äôs not my friend and he‚Äôs kind of an asshole. 

He treats women shitty to the point where some of our girl friends refuse to be around him, I‚Äôve never seen him or effort into his appearance other than when his frat has functions. Any time else he‚Äôs in a stained muscle shirt and sweat pants, all he does is drink and smoke to the point where he has to pay someone to do his work. He just seems like the anthesis of what everyone here says will help me with women.

Yet he‚Äôs always fucking different girls. Like literally always. One of us keeps a hit list of every girl he‚Äôs banged and it‚Äôs like 30 different girls. And I fully believe him because I‚Äôve seen him just go up to a random girl at a party and bring her up to his room to different girls in a single night. It‚Äôs crazy.

I mean he‚Äôs a good looking guy but it seems like he‚Äôs failing literally everywhere else and he still is successful with women and I put in so much effort and I can‚Äôt get a girl to hold a conversation with me and I can‚Äôt figure out what‚Äôs so wrong with me that one girl won‚Äôt take a liking.

Should I tell him or would that be a selfish confession (to make myself feel better)? I can't figure out what to do,"TLDR - I feel like I cheated on a guy I am talking to even though we are not in an exclusive relationship. I am not sure how to navigate the talking stage and I think telling him would hurt him for no reason other than to make myself feel better. 

So I've been seeing someone from Hinge for about 7 weeks. After our first date, we've generally been in a rhythm of texting a little throughout the day, and going on some type of date once a week where we have sex afterwards.

I got tested for STIs a month ago (ish) and told him about my negative results two weeks ago. We both said that we hadn't been with other people since we first hooked up in this conversation, but we didn't talk about not seeing other people or being exclusive. 

Over the weekend, I ran into a former one night stand at the bar. I was very drunk and I decided to go home with him. 

I am unsure if I should tell the guy I am talking to about what I did. I plan on getting tested again once enough time has elapsed for the test to be meaningful. I keep going back and forth. I think at the moment, I would only tell the guy if he suggested being exclusive/defining the relationship? Does this make sense? I think I wouldn't want to know if he was with someone else, but I hadn't thought about it before I slept with someone else this weekend.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9uhyh/i_21f_feel_like_i_cheated_even_though_22m_and_i/

So, in my experience I found some preferences I have that might be weird, rare, or turn off to a lot of women, so pls tell me if there are women with SIMILAR sexual preferences / traits like mine.

My sexual preferences / traits are like:

1. Don't like or need sex toys
2. Don't have sex fetishes
3. Don't watch porn - it's boring lol (I don't care if girl watches, just telling mine stuff)
4. Not into flirt games (I like being direct and honest from start)
5. Monogamy, don't need anyone else if I find emotional and spiritual connection with a girl. (Fun fact, no one teached me this, not a culture or any religion nor parents, I just knew I am not into polygamy or other stuff)
6. Once I find someone worth my time, I don't find anyone else attractive
7. Brutal honesty and being 100% open with a sexual partner
8. When I see them alturistic traits and emotions in a women, thats attractive to me
9. I like to show my emotions and don't want to be percived as feminine because of just being genuine good and empathetic
10. I think I am demisexual actually, what do you all think?

So, even tho I have high sex drive I put all of that into gym, and while I search for a similar girl like me , I find that kind of girls are rare in this hookup culture.

6. Then I go check his Facebook dating profile and it's no longer there. Then almost immediately, my friend sends me a screenshot of his Facebook dating profile that she just saw appear in her choices and I see his new selfie that he had just uploaded on Instagram on there. 
7. I confront him and tell him I find it strange that 2 days earlier during our Facetime he kept reassuring me that he likes me and only focuses on one girl at a time and that we were planning on spending all next weekend together and yet he's updating his dating profile with new pics. 
8.

He's unsure why he still appeared in my friend's choices.
9. He said he wants us to be exclusive. 
10. He's been distant/busy the last couple days, but says I can call/ text anytime...

If what he says is true, wouldn't I have received a notification that tells me one of my matches added a picture (if he indeed didn't unmatch me prior to adding the pic)?

I have feeling for him and we have been seeing each other almost every weekend for about 6 months now. Anyways at one point I wanted a relationship and he didn‚Äôt and made it clear he was going to still sleep with other people (going out to the bar, talking about it in my face, ect) so I said okay cool I‚Äôm going to do what I want to do as well. Plus he was still questionable messing around with the mother of his child. Anyways so randomly all of a sudden he starts saying he can‚Äôt stay the night with me anymore claiming he has to (work) which may be true but he would always leave and never stay overnight like he used to and started barely responding to texts and a lot of other things that bothered me just being distant. long story short he texted me on thanksgiving saying he tested positive for an std and said he thinks I was the one that gave it to him because he claims he was having sex with me the most frequently. And although I feel it was him because as previously stated he was seeing multiple other people while I was just seeing one other person that I just started sleeping with maybe 2 months ago when he told me we were just friends and he didn‚Äôt want a relationship. So anyways I could have gotten it from the other guy or he could have gave it to me there‚Äôs really no way to know. But he thinks I gave it to him and I think he gave it to me and we both got treated and what not so we didn‚Äôt see each other and barely texted for 2 weeks then over the weekend he came over and spent the night for the first time and assuming he was clean I have him head and then after that when I wanted to have sex with him he said ok with a condom so I got one then he said oh I‚Äôm too tired. So whatever went to sleep. The next night he comes over super late and again same thing then when I asked did he want to have sex he said he didn‚Äôt want to because he just got an std from me (allegedly )and he wasn‚Äôt feeling like comfortable to have sex right now even with a condom so I said wow well we‚Äôre both clean now I got the same treatment as u. He knew this I told him I went to the doctor and was on pills like last week. Anyways he responded saying well I don‚Äôt know that and he said he cares too much about his dick and the health of it and he can‚Äôt risk getting infected again. and proceeded to call me sneaky. EVEN THO it was clear and established first by him that we were sleeping with other people. So we ended up just talking and cuddling which was still nice because I hadn‚Äôt seen him in weeks. So how can he 1. Call me sneaky 2. Blame it on me 3. Say he doesn‚Äôt want to have sex anymore. Like I‚Äôm just feeling like what is even the point anymore.

91,r9vfch,1638755442,I‚Äôm trying to confront my fear of social interaction and women so I smiled at a girl today and she literally grimaced and turned away. I‚Äôm dying alone,"I‚Äôve been trying to overcome my social issues and my fear of women and my self esteem issues and today it literally all came crashing down.

I was in the library looking for a place to study for my final tomorrow and I walked down a hallway that some girl was walking the other way.

Normally I look to the ground try to get as far away from any female that I‚Äôm in the same area as, but this time I tried to be normal and behave like a regular well adjusted person. 

We made eye contact for like 2 seconds and I smiled. Not a flirty smile, not a creepy smile, just a closed mouth, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm acknowledging your presence smile‚Äù. Her face turned in disgust. I disgusted her. She was disgusted by me and seeing me. She then looked down and away from me. I was so embarrassed that I wanted to cry.

If that‚Äôs the effect I have on women I‚Äôm better off locking myself in my dorm until I die. I‚Äôm never going to find someone to love me. I‚Äôm never going to have someone. I‚Äôm unworthy of love and  I doubt I ever will be.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9vfch/im_trying_to_confront_my_fear_of_social/

95,r9vskj,1638756513,found out the guy I‚Äôm seeing is my political opposite. how to handle this?,"Hello! I (26F) have been on several dates with a man (25M) who I was generally feeling good about. I wouldn‚Äôt say we have a profound connection or anything, but he is a gentleman and treats me very well and has made it clear that he likes me a lot. He has a lot of traits that I would like in a partner. I was willing to give it more time, at least, to see if the true attraction might grow. 

Unfortunately, last night I found out that his political views are VERY much opposed to my own. We had a civil and respectful discussion about it‚Ä¶and I appreciated his honesty, but really cannot justify or tolerate some of his beliefs. I mean pretty major social issues. He even admitted that his opinions had seriously damaged his relationship with his ex and caused a lot of fights. She‚Äôs on the same side of the aisle as me.

Is this worth trying to work through? At all? Or, how do I end this peacefully?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9vskj/found_out_the_guy_im_seeing_is_my_political/
96,r9w7v0,1638757759,"Ghosted after ""the best first date of her life"".... should I ask why?","25M, went on a date with a 25F two weeks ago now. We had talked for almost three weeks prior to that date so it was a pretty significant date for us. 

The date was absolutely incredible... conversation flowed so smoothly, we both laughed so much, and had such a blast getting to know each other while drinking and dancing. It was a Monday night and she told me ""this is the most fun I've ever had on a Monday."" She also said it was something like the best first date of her life. She was so complimentary toward me and genuinely seemed suuuper into me. We planned a second date at the end of the night. 

Unfortunately, the next morning we both woke up pretty sick. We texted back and forth a lot about our sicknesses and she mentioned she was really glad we got to hang out. A few days later, she texted me saying she was negative for covid but thinks she has the flu. I asked her if she got tested for the flu...read no reply. I sent a meme an hour later and asked her 2 days later how she was feeling...to both of which she read no reply. BOOM I got ghosted and it has absolutely torn me up. It doesn't make any sense.... why would she ghost after such an incredible night? It's been two weeks now and I'm still all flustered :/ 

This would be like my 4th text in a row now so it'd be quite humiliating... but should I ask her what happened? Not knowing is freaking killing me. It just doesn't make any sense. I feel really hurt because I was so excited and I really liked her, or so I thought.  thanks",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9w7v0/ghosted_after_the_best_first_date_of_her_life/

The conversation went well like questions were being thrown out and had some good but ended a bit quickly, maybe about 2 hours. He walked me to my car and it was sweet but at the end he tried to kiss me but I went in for the hug then it got to this super awkward like uh I don‚Äôt know what to do moment. So when we did kiss it was so awkward, like a super small peck and then I just apologized because I started laughing about how awkward it was. We said our goodbye and I texted that same night saying I had a good time and there was a response but nothing for the next couple of days. Sent a text and then no respond (which is fine). Although I feel like it might not go anywhere because of the lack of reply I‚Äôm just really proud of myself that I was able to put myself out there after that horrible relationship I had in the past but it‚Äôs hard to not get discouraged.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9wnm2/first_date_in_over_a_year_and_super_awkward_first/
