0,rbwgzf,1638984859,How do I let a guy know that I'm looking for a relationship in a way that's seemingly chill and not high maintenance?,"I (31F) stopped seeing a divorced guy (39M) recently who, although was funny, kind, smart, and consistent with texting, was pretty avoidant and flaky.

Before our first date, he asked if I had any serious relationships under my belt, and I told him no but I was just needing to find the right person.

First date went well, however, he told me he wasn't looking for a relationship but would be open to it with the right person, and I didn't say anything and went along with it. Second date went well and we ended up messing around and talking afterwards.

I went ahead and asked him out for the third date, but he declined saying he had a buddy in town that weekend without attempting to reschedule. He texted me a few days later saying he wanted to see me soon, and I suggested that Friday, and he declined again without attempting to reschedule. Obviously, I'm pretty frustrated at this point and pull back a bit.

He texted me that Saturday night asking to hang out last minute, and it went pretty terribly. I was tired and irritable from working all day, still frustrated with him, and the subsequent sex was pretty awkward and uncomfortable as a result. Aside from a few good moments, I acted pretty passive aggressively and snarky towards him. He was getting a bit frustrated too but attempted to reestablish a connection and get to the bottom of my frustration. He texted over the next few days trying to be more affectionate and serious, but he eventually slow faded on me. Not sure if he slow faded me because he thought I was slow fading him or what.

I ended up texting him a couple weeks later and apologized for my mood, and he texted me not to worry about it and that we were on really good terms and to keep him up to date on my new house. We texted a bit afterwards, and I thought that was the end of it.

Fast forward to now, he keeps texting me every couple weeks to ""check in."" He texts me things like ""hope you're well"" and asks me if I've moved into my new house yet. Not sure if he's just trying to be cordial, breadcrumbing me, or what.

Couple of questions: How do I let a guy know that I'm looking for a relationship and communicate my needs in a way that's seemingly chill and not high maintenance? Was it at all possible he was interested, and I was being unreasonable? He did say he wanted to introduce me to his friends and asked me questions about how I manage finances and where I see myself living.

Even when I sense that they are subtly flirting, I would become possessed by some anti-dating demon and blurt totally discouraging responses. I have never flirted in my life. 

Last week an attractive guy kept stealing glances at me, and I was stealing glances at him, but we quickly looked away when our eyes met. I came out of a communal bathroom where we were to find him waiting outside. He made eye contact with me and I reflexively scurried away. There’s a part of me that doesn’t want to assume he was intending to make a move.

Still can’t figure out how some people get dates out of a Starbucks run, or have a meet cute in a park. Nobody has ever directly asked me out in public, but I’m sure whatever I was doing didn’t help.

We recently had the talk about what we were both looking for (serious relationships) and I feel really good about getting to know him. We normally go on a date once a week and text daily, however last night he started talking to me about where he wants to move to in the next few years and talking about setting down roots, I was pretty supportive of the fact that he knew where he wanted to go and didn’t try to interject myself into his plans because we are still just getting to know each other. The weird thing is that I have yet to hear from him today after he opened up and he normally connects with me at least sometime in the morning.

11,rc19bz,1638998345,Should I make a move or will it make me look too desperate?,"Should I make a move and risk getting rejected?

An old friend from school (32M) and I (32F) recently reconnected. We live about 3 hours away from each other. 

Everything was very platonic at first. Responding to IG stories and then he reached via text (still had my number from college). This advanced to daily texting and phone calls/FaceTime a few times a week. One night he FaceTimed me for advice on what to wear to a wedding. He then randomly asked me to go with him. At that time I declined. He said he had another on coming up and to think about it. 

He ended up stopping to visit me on his way to the wedding, we had dinner. He also stopped on his way home, we had lunch. I agreed to go to the wedding with him. We had a blast and hooked up. He was very affectionate the beginning of the trip. But the last day things seemed to cool off. He was working nights the past month. But we still managed to text, but not as frequently. I was overthinking but tried to give it space. He texted me over Thanksgiving saying he wished I was there, even though he was going to be sleeping the whole weekend. He celebrated a birthday a few days later. I jokingly texted I’m on my with the balloons tomorrow, but he responded he had dinner plans, but maybe later in the week. He didn’t ever respond with an invite. I really didn’t know how to feel about that. 

Finally, this week I get the first call since we went to the wedding a month ago. He’s finally done with his night shift and has some weekends off. I brought up how I was looking for a place. He responded why? You should just move in with me… idk if that was serious. It felt that way. Because I declined but kinda entertained the idea. He basically said think about it and I’m welcome anytime. I don’t know if he’s taking/dating anyone else. I honestly don’t know how to read the situation.

Sooooo I really want to see him this weekend. Should I ask if he’s free? I don’t want to seem to forward or get turned away. How should I approach this without looking desperate? Honestly I just want to get out of town and do something fun, but not sure if that puts weird pressure on him.

TLDR; I (32F recently reconnected with old school friend (32M). We live three hours away. Some mixed signals that could be me overthinking/anxiety or just him not being interested. He extended an invite earlier this week. Should I ask him if he wants my company this weekend?",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/rc19bz/should_i_make_a_move_or_will_it_make_me_look_too/

17,rc2dkt,1639001528,Conversations turning into competitions,"I (F40) love nothing more than getting into a good conversation about music, art or books. I have a literature degree and have spent many years working in independent record shops and bookstores, and I even hosted a radio show for a few years. I was always learning as much as I could so I could keep up with my co-workers and customers and the end result is that I can shoot the breeze on a lot of random, obscure topics (not in a show off-y or aggressive way, just for fun).

The problem is that when I do meet a guy with similar interests, my knowledge seems to trigger his insecurities and he will turn the conversation into a competition. I hate it. It's like they have to ""win"" by proving that they know more than me - and because of my background, they rarely do. Often I'll get negged. Last night a conversation with a man about Brion Gysin ended with him telling me that my dress was ugly at which point I politely said goodbye and went home.

It's because I'm easily distracted, so I can't play music and multitask. And when I'm relaxing, I'd rather read than lay down and listen to music.

I often really enjoy music when I come across it in the wild -- at the grocery store or in an Uber, or something -- or when I play it for myself. I think I enjoy it as much as anyone. But my taste is profoundly uncool. There's no artist or genre that I'm especially into. I just like retro top 40 and random indie pop.

30,rc7y4p,1639018583,I was the cool low maintenance girl that always went with the flow and that’s probably why at 34yrs I’m still single. I want to change that.,"TLDR: How and when do I state that my end goal is a relationship and then marriage? How does one word it? When is the right time to bring it up? Social cues don’t come naturally to me so I need help in areas like this. 

This is inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/rbwgzf/how_do_i_let_a_guy_know_that_im_looking_for_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) that i (34f) have just read and some people in the comments made very good points to which I figured out over the last 5 years. 

Almost 5 years ago I ended a 3 year relationship, he’d been stringing me along “dangling” the idea of marriage. A week before my 30th (and six months of hell with his severe avoidant behaviour prior) he told me he wasn’t ready for marriage to which my response was “if you’re not ready after 3 years then you’re never going to be ready. It’s over”. Devastated and being an over analyser, I reflected hard on why he treated me like that (there’s more to the story but irrelevant) and I learnt a lot about boundaries and even more so about standards. 

I can say that my standards have improved a lot but still needs a lot more improvement. I just ended a 3 month situationship, and how apt that word is because what started the break up was that he used the word “situation” instead of relationship. We were in a relationship considering the way he behaved. I said to him “is that all I am to you? Just a situation?! I would have thought I was something a little more than that!” After a few days of him “thinking about it” and then telling me he doesn’t want a relationship I ditched him but was HB cos I fell for him. 

I’m quite a blunt person and was never taught how to communicate what I need (abusive upbringing = FA attachment working on that) so I really struggle with this.

I want to make it a fun evening where we're both focused on pleasure, but also want to put in a few extra touches to make it a little more special for her.

33,rc8zhz,1639021979,Boyfriend (45) probably just broke up with me (F31) over clubbing.,"Me and my boyfriend have been in a sweet, loving relationship for the past 5 months. We have established exclusivity about a month in. We just had a massive fight after which he basically ghosted me and now I'm worried sick whether he's ok. He has been completely unresponsive after the fight last evening, not even reading my texts. It's now 4:43 AM where we are.

To the background: He told me that he was going for a pizza with a friend of his. He does this on a bi-weekly basis or so, and I'm completely cool with that. I wished him a good evening and we texted here and there later. Then eventually he told me that they're in this club (original plan was to only go out eating because he's working tomorrow, but I was still cool). I googled the place out of sheer curiosity, not because I suspected anything. Well, the place is labelled as a private club and a nightclub, and advertises with scantily-clad women and words such as ""intimate atmosphere"" and ""don't tell anyone"". It's not a downright sex club, but it's most definitely a club where people go to flirt and hook up. There's red lights, sexy cocktails, loveseats, music. I expressed that I'm not comfortable with him being there because a) of the nature of the place and b) why would a 45yo grown-ass man go somewhere with drunk 20+ women. 

He got absolutely livid. He called me to yell at me screaming that I don't trust him, that I will never trust him, that I think he's a cheating A-hole and whatnot. Then he ended the call and is MIA ever since. I have been sending messages and calling for the past 5 hours, no response, no read ticks. He's with a friend that I know so if I don't get him by morning, I'm texting this friend to just see if he's ok.

I'm heartbroken. I feel like either he just broke up with me after I recently received a PhD contract in his country and we were both excited about no longer being long distance (long-ish, we're 2 hours drive apart which isn't crazy). Or after he treated me this way and basically stonewalled me, our relationship will be damaged if I can even stay in it.
