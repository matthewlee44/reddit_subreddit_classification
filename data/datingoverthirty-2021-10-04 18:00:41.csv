29,q1s591,1633422571,"Dating and Needing Time. Most confusing relationship thing I've ever had to navigate, and just looking for a bit of perspective.","Just looking for a bit of perspective on meeting someone, dating, and needing time. This is going to be a bit long- it's the first time I'm really putting everything out there. 

 I'm a 31M, and met a 26F about 7 months ago on OLD.  We had a great connection right off the bat, it felt like we had known each other for years, she was absolutely beautiful, all of that. Unfortunately, she ended up leaving the country to visit family for 3 months shortly after. We remained in touch for a bit, but she eventually disappeared. That sucked, but thems the breaks with OLD so I just moved on. 

However, once she came back she got back in touch and we picked up right where we left off. Plans were made for our first date, we talked every day leading up to it and when it finally happened it was everything you could ask for. Spent about 24 hours together, no sex but making out and cuddling and all that. 

We made plans for a second date and continued our usual texting routine. Right in the middle of it though she ended up disappearing again. This time it sucked pretty hard. Fast forward a few days and she gets back to me- she found she was pregnant. And not with me, obviously.

I'm thinking oh shit, what? huh? Asked to meet in person to talk about things and she agreed. 

Turns out she had reconnected with an ex while she was gone over that 3 months, and that's how it happened. But she made the difficult decision that he nor a child was in her future and that she was going to get an abortion. I decided that I didn't want to let what we possibly had going for us end over it as long as she didn't want it to, and we agreed to continue seeing each other and seeing what we could be.

She had the procedure shortly after, and we met for dinner a few days later. Our bond grew a bit deeper, and I was happy with where things were possibly heading. She ended up leaving again (though not the country) to go back to her hometown for about a month. But our communication remained constant with good mornings and good nights, pictures of our days, calls, miss yous, the whole deal. She finally comes back, and we end up going for dinner and an impromptu weekend trip the day after. It was everything you could ask for. I meet her family a few days later, we talk about the future and plans and goals for us, etc. Cloud 9 and I was stoked on life. The only real issue was a lack of physical intimacy, which was due to her abortion killing any sex drive she had. But we talked about it, and I was comfortable with waiting for whenever she was ready, which she appreciated.

She went away for about a week and a half again to visit a friend, but communication remained the same. 

She gets back, we meet a couple of times. A little bit after I just wanted to check in on us, what we were, and all of that. I told her my feelings for her, which she echoed, but she began to break down in tears soon after. The abortion was still affecting her hard, and she was scared of relationships and that she wasn't 100% sure she can fully commit to something serious right now. It hurt to see her hurt, and even more to hear that, but I asked if there was a silent ""with you [me]"" as a part of that statement, and if there was then I walk away and that's that. She emphasized no, and that she can still see a future, but things are just really tough for her right now between the abortion, finding a new job, etc. We wrapped our talk up happier for having it, thanked each other for being honest and communicating, and kiss goodbye. 

Here's where everything fell apart.

She texts me an extremely long message a few hours later asking for time. Our talk earlier brought up a lot of hard feelings for her with what she went through, that it's been hard to establish a relationship because of it and all the time apart. She said she couldn't have made it through everything without me, but that she feels bad about things like no sex, and that she isn't sure that she can make me happy the way that I do her. I respond as best I can saying that I can only imagine how hard everything has been for her and all I wanted was to be a source of comfort through it all, that she does make me happy more than she could even know. I echoed something we talked about earlier, that we've never been this comfortable with someone before, and that it feels like home when I'm with her. I ended it by telling her to take all the time she needs, and that I'll be here whenever she's ready. 

It's been about 2 weeks since then and I'm a wreck. I'm completely aware that time can mean a day, a week, a month, whatever, but man, it's been hard. I'm also aware that needing time almost always means things are over, but from the start, our relationship has been something completely different than anything I've ever gone through or experienced. 

I'm doing the best I can to focus on myself, started seeing a counselor, and got out of the city for a few days. I also know that may have been the last time I ever see her or talk to her again. But fuck is it crushing and confusing. Can someone just genuinely need time and come out better for it? How do you get through it? 

 I know I rambled a bit, it's still hard to write everything out. Thanks for having read this long if you have.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/q1s591/dating_and_needing_time_most_confusing/

33,q1u165,1633431602,Reconnecting with my (33m) ex (32f) after pining over her for two years. Need help.,"We dated for about 5 months approximately two years ago. I (33m) fell for her (32f) almost immediately, but took things slow for a few months before telling her that I was “falling in love with her” and she replied that she was falling in love with me as well. It was and is still the happiest moment of my life. 

She wanted me to meet her mom and step-dad, and I introduced her to my
parents. After meeting them for the first and only time, she wrote my folks a hand written card saying how excited she was to share so many more good times with us. 

A couple weeks later, she broke up with me one morning as we were laying in bed. There was no warning. I felt blindsided. I never got good reasons. Vague things like: she was still dealing with trauma from a past relationship, and that there were “issues with sex” (never able to tell me what those were and I’ve never received complaints from any of my other numerous partners). She also said that “she needs to be madly in love with her partner, and she never quite got there with me.” (Despite insane chemistry, her whispering “I’m crazy about you” in my ear, etc.). I was confused, and so hurt. I pride myself on being a good communicator, and combined with my willingness for things to work, had we ever had a conversation about what was bothering her we could have worked through it- but we never had that conversation. 

I fought for her. She agreed to see me a couple times over the next few months and I told her how I felt, that I was in love and wanted to make this work. Eventually she said that her and I shouldn’t see each other anymore. I was truly heartbroken for the first time in my life. 

I ended up meeting some one else, and that relationship was more balanced and had much better and clearer communication. However, I never stopped thinking about my ex. It’s a truly horrible feeling to wake up laying next to someone and wish it was someone else. Even though I cared for my new girlfriend, my relationship with her felt disingenuous and so I ended it.

Fast forward to a month ago. My initial ex and I bump into each other and learn we’ve since each moved and now live much closer to the other. We’ve gotten together twice in two weeks. The first time I invited her over for wine and then we went for dinner. A few days later she made plans with me to go over to her place later that next week. Her taking that initiative gave me some hope she was interested.

On our first meeting, she shared that has been seeing someone for few months - an older guy (42), but has complained to me about him on both occasions (he has been flaky on plans with her, asked her to leave his place one night without having sex, criticizes her over her work [they are both in the same field], etc.).

I told her that she deserves so much more; someone who cherishes and prioritizes her. 

On our second meeting when he came up, I said I didn’t want to hear about him, especially whether or not they’re having sex. She replied that it worried her and that perhaps she and I can’t hang out as friends. At this point, I spilled my guts and told her I had thought about her every day, and that dating others was difficult for me because she’s all I really want. That nothing has changed for me.

She reached her hand out to me and interlocked her fingers with mine and said that was “music to any single girl’s ears”- but that she wasn’t single right now. She also said she felt like she should at least try to make it work with this guy. Now I’m confused and reeling. I ask her how he would feel if he knew we were seeing each other twice in a week. She said he isn’t the jealous type and she would be honest if she was asked but wasn’t going to bring it up to him. 

She said she doesn’t know how she feels about me yet because I just “popped up again” and that I would have to “play the long game.” Pathetically, I’m willing to do that for her, but the fact she’s with someone else really fucks me up. We ended up having fun, casual nights together both times- wine, music, other friends around, but I feel like I may have scared her by being too heavy with things.

Also worth mentioning neither her or I have kids, and that we both eventually want to. She’s emphasized to me in the past that she really wants stability and reliability in a partner.

Today I texted her to say I was having a few friends over later this week and that I’d love for her to join us. She said “Aw thanks, I have a lot going on this week so might not be able to, but will let you know as we get closer.” Is this a soft “no?” Why not a hard no? She has been able to say to me in the past “we shouldn’t see each other” and I respected that at the time. This feels different. Now that I’ve told her how I feel, it isn’t really plausibly deniable that we are hanging out as just friends. 

I don’t know what to do and how to interpret things. I’m really vulnerable with her, and can’t help but feel like I ruined my chances with her by over sharing my feelings towards her. 

Please help. I’m grateful for all advice, guidance, and interpretations. Thank you.

Tl;dr : still in love with my ex, and we’ve seen each other twice in a week after no contact for over a year. She’s seeing an older guy, but complains about him to me. She isn’t really saying yes or no to me. Don’t know how to proceed.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/q1u165/reconnecting_with_my_33m_ex_32f_after_pining_over/
34,q1u9n9,1633432564,Cut off time for plans,"Does anyone else have a cut off time on the day of a first date, where once its passed, the plans are now off?

Context: a guy (34) asked me (36) on Saturday when I'm free. I said Tuesday (tonight). He suggested a drink but no time or place. Whilst I subscribe to the 'this is not plans' mentality, we live in a smallish town and I genuinely am free tonight regardless so I'm feeling a little flex on this, vs a Saturday for instance or where a counter offer from a friend has transpired.
He has not replied to my last message from Sunday night, but daily messages has not been our style.

That said, it's now midday Tuesday and I am thinking anything passed 3pm (that's if he reaches out at all) is a bit rude on his part and an instant no from me.

OP: As the tittle says I am struggling to get any matches on Tinder (2 a month tops), let alone those that will initiate contact (less than 1 a month recently). I am currently living in Brno, CZ (450k pop), even though nearby there's Vienna, Prague and Bratislava, Would appreciate some hardcore feedback. Roast me, please.

I know I'm a bit of a niche, but this is also intended, I see no reason to lie to people about things I like only to get them on a date and discover later they are against it, but I still feel like there should be more than one match per month.

One think I know is that my profile + bio reading is WAY too long, but this is intentional and I am not too keen on removing it, but will adjust, as I would like to avoid people with whom I will share no common interest (this is very important for me to form chemistry) with or those who would struggle to communicate with me (I either overshare, overexplain, or go non-verbal). I would like to be as myself as possible, but still roast me as hard as you can, every opinion is valuable.

Also obviously non native English, so if you have any ideas on how to improve that part, please share.

37,q1ui69,1633433557,"""If things go well""","So, I'm confused. A couple of men I've been talking to for a few days online, have asked me on hypothetical dates.

The first one, who likes sports and I mentioned being interested in seeing a game sometime, asked ""We could go see a match together sometime, if you'd like to"". That's it - no concrete plans, just a vague sentiment. Even when I responded positively.

Another one I've been texting online, after I mentioned signing up for dance classes, ""if things go well, I'd like to be your dance partner"".

I'm a little baffled by these comments. They have both been made before any concrete plans to go on an actual date.

Do these men want to go on a date with me? What am I supposed to respond? I'd like to meet for coffee first and get to know each other a little, before suggesting something much more time intensive far off into the future, like dance partners or going to a sports game that lasts several hours.

But saying I want to go on a date first, in response to their comment, feels pushy - obviously, they would have suggested going on a date if that's what they wanted.

42,q1x6xz,1633443100,How to handle job/income disparity?,"Hi. 38/m. Recently amicably separated after a 15 year marriage. I'm getting my feet wet with OLD apps. I've never used them before. They seem super emotionally manipulative. I'm looking for relationships, not big on ONS. I've never been really interested in the bar scene. I do have a few social hobbies but am not really looking for dates when I'm doing those.

I work in the tech industry. But, I work remotely in a small town, so I have a somewhat large place to myself, somewhat expensive/time intensive hobbies, and a decent amount of free time. I've had a few matches who work in the service industry, or other long hours career. I try to avoid talks about money but the chats/dates eventually veer toward hobbies and I try to downplay things but I feel like I sound out-of-touch and just like it ruins the mood.

I have no intention of being patriarchal, or implying some kind of ""dont worry babe ill can take care of you"" vibe but I feel like that comes off in one way or another. I want to say I don't care what career (or not) a date would have, but it seems to matter a lot. Like, if one person works a lot they don't have a lot of time to date, or have similar hobbies so talking to them about that kind of stuff just turns us into oil and water.

51,q21i7j,1633455609,"How to determine if slow moving, or just ""friend-zoned?""","Curiosity question, and wondering what other people's thoughts are on it before I make a decision.

I (33M) have gone on 4-5 pleasant dates with someone of similar age (32F) and socioeconomic status (calling out that there's no large disparity there). While all of them have involved a little kissing, heavy petting, etc. at the end they've concluded early, and seemed casual overall. Always had a good time, natural conversation flow, good personality matching, etc.

For background, I had some short term flings this year that fizzled for a variety of reasons, and she hasn't been dating at all this year. I was the first person from OLD she's actually met up with.

There's no religious, family, or cultural baggage in play here, and we've made plenty of double-entendre type dirty jokes along the way. We've both hung out in each other's neighborhoods, she's declined to see my place and hasn't extended any invites to her place when I was there even with some hints.

We had talked about hanging in my area for the next one, but she then wanted to meet halfway in the middle so it'd be a quick ride home to walk her dog afterwards. Coming up on half a dozen dates over nearly 2 months and there's seemingly zero interest in intimacy; I'd think at our age that's a red flag that I'm just a friend for entertainment till she finds someone else.

Anyone want to weigh in on if I'm just on a faster timeline than she is here and I should give more time? Or more likely I'm just being strung along and nothing is going to change?  


Edit: The ""Friend-zone"" term I'm aware has some baggage, I wasn't sure of a better term for the situation of being treated platonically but without communicating it as such.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/q21i7j/how_to_determine_if_slow_moving_or_just/
52,q21iv6,1633455665,Told to act more ‘mysterious’ and not put in effort till it’s clear the guy is worth it,"I’m a very direct person. Once I warm up to someone, I’m not inclined to play games. If a man seems promising but isn’t taking the initiative to ask me out, I’d outright tell him to do so. I’m looking for a serious relationship and don’t believe in playing hard to get, beyond giving myself and the other party a comfortable amount of space. I try to value each match and foster a connection, and this is rooted in my desire to find a partner. 

Recently, this guy asked me to meet him in his neighbourhood first so we could head to the restaurant together for our first date. It was an unusual request, but I agreed because it sounded fun and was reasonably on the way for me. We could chit-chat and bond before our meal, instead of awkwardly greeting each other for the first time at the venue itself.

My female friend told me “it was a bit desperate, like you can’t wait to see him” and “it gives guys the wrong impression” when I do that. Most of my girlfriends agreed that they don’t understand why I couldn’t just meet him at the restaurant directly. 

My friend then told me not to put in so much effort “till you know he’s worth it” and “don’t overwater the plant at the start”. She also advised me to be more mysterious. Apparently, guys like the kind of chase where I’m not so easy to get. 

I honestly felt a little upset hearing that, because these women are all happily married to great guys and I’m the only singleton trying to find a partner while they keep telling me I’m taking things too seriously too early. I don’t feel like I did anything wrong, and I want to stay true to myself. But every time I step off yet another bad date, I can’t help but think, is being myself not helping? OLD has been so confusing for someone like me.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/q21iv6/told_to_act_more_mysterious_and_not_put_in_effort/

58,q22zya,1633460214,Went for a date after 2 years. Don't know what to make of this.,"I (33f) went out for a date (35m). I met them on an app, and they had good pictures in on there. Nothing over the top though, just the usual a bust pic, one hike pic and 2 more similar ones. We've been talking for about 2 months before the first meet. I had some work engagement and then they had some of their own. Then we lost the thread of texts and there was radio silence for a couple weeks in between. And we started again to talk, but mostly initiated by me. 

Anyhoo, long story short, we plan to meet for drinks. They pick me up from my place, and drive me and we get our drinks and everything and as we sit down I notice that they have a balding patch on their crown. It is not visible if someone were looking facing them, but it is visible from behind. I felt a tinge of disappointment, that it they were sneaky about it. I didn't let that affect the date, we had a good conversation. Later that night as they were dropping me home they asked if they could get a kiss just as I was about to get out of the car, to which I declined as politely as I could have.

I'm a chronic people pleaser and that night and the following few days I was upset for letting someone down. I mean they were nice to me on the date and in general seemed like a good person. But I just didn't feel like kissing them that night, because I left that I needed more connection and investment time wise getting to know each other better before I open up to them like that.


I texted them later to see if they were upset and still wanted to talk. I wished to see them again and talk about why I declined their advances and what I wanted from them and also to know what they wanted from me. They didn't reply for a couple of days and I followed up again, and this time they were their usual funny self and made a few jokes. 
They mentioned that they cannot make time in person for at least 2 weeks due to work related reasons ( which I felt was a 'meh' reason). 


Given all of this I don't know what should I do. I have been speaking with them through texts for almost 2.5 months now, and so far we've met once during. The date went fine, but I felt they kept a part of their appearance hidden, and only revealed once we met in person. I want to be the bigger person here, who understands that people are insecure as am I about appearances. And now I am feeling less and less bad about declining their wish to kiss me, given that they are also unable to make time for me (text and in person), which is what I wish for. Should I let this connection go wherever it has to go, or should I put in effort for them to see me again. 

Send help.


Edit: It feels like somehow I have given the impression that I am hung up on the fact that they are balding. I'm not, I am able to see past that. The thing that I am unable to figure out is both of us got disappointed in one form or the other. Me disappointed that they are not as excited to see me next as I am, and them disappointed that I am not reciprocating to their advances as they would like me to. 

Online dating is a mess, I am slowing getting to know. Making a connection is difficult, finding someone who would want to go out with you is difficult thing too.

He was a great conversation partner and we had a lot in common. There was a good amount of drinking as well as playing pool at a few bars during the date- I didn’t realize he was so drunk until he walked me home and sat down on my stoop and was unable to get up. I took his phone out and called him and Uber. He did not mention it after but we have texted a bunch and he wants to see my again. 

I was not drunk. This may be an accident that he got to this point, but I am wary, having had partners with alcohol issues in the past.This guy was otherwise very nice and cool. He was not creepy or badly behaved when drunk.

The thing is, I’ve always kind of wanted to be in a relationship at some point. I just fear the pity I may experience if it never happens for me. I’d rather tell my family that I’m not in a relationship because I don’t want to be, as opposed to them realizing no one wants me. 

I’ve been using OLD for a bit and I am talking to someone I quite like. My thing is, how do I tell my family I’m dating without it being awkward? And if it doesn’t work out with this guy, how can I possibly revert back to my coping mechanism? I guess I know the truth is that I can’t. I’m just afraid. And it’s making me want to double down and say no dating ever. I just really want to be a mom someday and I’d like to have a life partner. Any advice is welcome.

65,q26py8,1633471341,How does normal dating work?,"So, I have had some problems with attracting narcissistic guys in the past. It’s just something about the avoidant emotional style and how they make me feel so special somehow. When I met my ex he would text me every day and kept asking me out on dates. I felt so seen and almost high from it. But after 2 months or so, once I’m hooked, the discard starts. I just came out of that relationship and I honestly don’t know what happened. 

I probably shouldn’t date yet, but I met this sweet dude and we have met up twice. We have a 3rd date scheduled, but I honestly don’t know if he’s very interested. We don’t really message that much, and I somehow don’t mind. I’m so sick of waiting by my phone for replies etc, and we have a much better time talking irl anyway. When we hang out, it’s always super nice. We connect so much more than me and my ex ever did, and it feels nice to be with an empathetic person again. 

But is this normal? We don’t really know each other yet, and I think I prefer having these early talks irl. I have a ton of things I wanna know about him, but I honestly don’t have the energy or desire to do it over the phone. In the past, I have ALWAYS messaged a lot in the beginning, and it always ended up pretty weird. I somehow “fell for” a better version of them which I created in my head somehow. 

This whole situation is just odd. A part of me thinks that maybe I have healed a lot and that I’m simply not as desperate for this constant attention anymore. It also feels nice to take things slow and actually be able to focus on my job and friends. I honestly don’t like getting to know someone via text that much anymore. My ex was so loving via text, but a fucking cold asshole irl. 

But then I wonder if him not texting me is just a sign that he isn’t so interested? Or that I’m not interested? As someone who has always been quite anxious, is it possible to date someone without being nervous all the time? I don’t think about him that much when I’m doing other things, but I do love his company and I find him extremely hot. 

Worth mentioning is that I started medicating my ADHD recently, which has made me a lot more mellow. I don’t get the same rush from being anxious, and I try to basically have a much more chill life. 

I hope I make any sense! I honestly just wanna know if I simply have become more “secure” now or something! That would be great!",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/q26py8/how_does_normal_dating_work/

We had slept together and talked a good deal between dates, so I had assumed the connection was at least somewhat reciprocated as well. A few days ago I texted her to ask what she was doing next weekend, and instead got back a short response saying she had been thinking about how this was not the right time for her to be dating as she was too busy with other things in her life.

Of course I was a little bit disappointed by this, but everyone has their priorities, and it's understandable that she decided dating was not at the top of her list. I was more surprised that she chose to break it off over text instead of a phone call. I've always felt like a simple, polite text is appropriate after a first date where no connection is felt, but any time after that, I would at least give them the option of a phone call - especially after sex was involved.

Have texted or talked on the phone every day since then, **with her almost always initiating**. So far she has called me 3 times. We have another date setup. **Yesterday she wanted us to take our profiles down so we did.** 

She's made comments before about whether I'm waiting for her to text me, etc. But she also told me she gives me space and doesn't want to bother me.

So after we agreed to take our profiles down last night and confirmed the date coming up in a few days, we said we'd talk to each other between now and then.

So I'm wondering, should I initiate once in a while with her? I tend to err on the side of it's better to under text than over text. She had even commented to me there was a guy who texted her constantly every day, all day and she got annoyed.

**So while I could initiate tonight and has her about her day like she did mine yesterday and other days, I'm thinking it's good to have her miss me a bit, wonder what I'm doing, etc. It's better to text her tomorrow, skip a day.**

I see these apps have had no pay offs for me and it's just been a learning lesson for how to read people and realize how shitty the world can be. I also figured that dating doesn't happen at the switch of a button like.these apps expect us to behave. All my relationships have stemmed out from prior acquaintances were we knew each other and dated much later and it felt organic. 

But its time to get off these apps for at least. I've run out friend's friends who are single, don't get to meet anyone new at work. Not sure what else will change for me but decided to delete these apps and make peace with single hood for ever OR an occasional date in real life if it ever happens. 

Where I live, there are not many social activities no clubbing/pub scene, very few opportunities to meet people organically as far as I can think of. There are activities like surfing, cycling, etc which I cannot participate in due to chronic pain issues. Already a part of book clubs.

91,q2hbx9,1633514678,Looking for a little reassurance,"TL;DR: dated and connected well with dated a great guy, separated 10 months with two kids and VERY close relationship with ex wife (who initiated the divorce and has a boyfriend). When I expressed discomfort with the relationship with ex and asked to understand it better, he broke up with me and said it’s because I don’t accept their relationship and his feelings for me changed (after an amazing fun and affectionate weekend- in public I might add). Going from super happy and so aligned to nothing hurts and scares me for future relationships. Need insight or maybe just reassurance so I don’t put up walls and push people away in the future out of fear. 



I’ve been doing so well with dating. I’m confident, happy, and I don’t get attached as easily. I can form bonds without being devastated when things end. And honestly, in the past, this situation would have had me devastated Like wanting to call out of work and cry all day, cancel my weekend plans to cry etc. and probably blowing up the guys phone begging him to reconsider. I did cry! But I don’t want anyone who doesn’t want me and this morning I feel OK. Just sad but I’m going to keep living my life. So, I could use a little reassurance and maybe insight so I don’t close up and get scared of connecting with new people.

I (33f) dated this amazing guy (34m) for 1.5 months. We got close quickly but it was healthy and balanced. However, I did have some hesitation in the beginning which we discussed and I felt better. In hindsight, I was walking into a mess and I believe he believed he had it under control. 

He is separated 9 or 10 months from a 12 year marriage, soon to be ex wife. Ex wife asked for the divorce and started seeing her now boyfriend while they were still married. 

He did date someone briefly before me and at that time he realized he was not ready. Broke up, started therapy. Still goes to therapy. 

He has 2 kids, a 3 and 5 year old. He and his ex have a nesting situation (kids stay at the house and they have separate dwelling quarters so he had his own place). They’re selling the house now. 

So, he started to become a little distant and he and I both assumed it was stress with selling the house. However, one thing I had an issue with and wanted to understand better (this is totally new to me) was the relationship with the ex wife. They get along for the most part (which is AMAZING and preferable over baby momma drama) but they’re together a lot as a family. Also, they hadn’t totally publicized their separation. They were doing it slowly and letting it come out naturally like selling the house and living separately. He did not hide our relationship. We spent time at his place and mine and in public quite often. We also did run into someone I knew who knew his friend from his town (small town). So I wasn’t a secret.

The ex wife also requested he tell her his whereabouts when he was more than 15 min from their kids (other than work). Which meant every time he came to see me.

I had my opinions but I’m neither a parent nor a child psychologist nor a divorce expert so I just shrugged it off.

Something that bugged me, was responding to her texts (that were unrelated to the kids) when we were having our time. 

In hindsight maybe I should have set firmer boundaries earlier on. But, this progressively became a problem. I think the more she knew he was with someone else she felt jealousy or possessiveness. And kind of would “flex” to get him to respond or show she still “had him.” Maybe subconsciously- she doesn’t seem like a bad person. Maybe she wasn’t as ready to let go as she thought.

So all of this combined, I was feeling a little uneasy and I wanted to understand the dynamic better and get a little reassurance. So when I brought it up, he ended it.

He said that my lack of acceptance of their relationship was a problem and his feelings for me had also changed. This was after we had an amazing weekend together. Very affectionate and just fun!

I know sometimes, often times, feelings do change.  But more importantly I know that he likely isn’t ready. I believe he believed he’s ready and I believed he believed he did not have feelings for his ex wife like that anymore and I wanted to believe the same. I’d like to believe that his feelings for me did not change and it was his lack of readiness and healing.

He really was a great guy and he treated me so well. He was reliable and dependable and supportive. We could talk about anything and he was a great communicator. The biggest problem we ever had was this, and honestly I just didn’t like how he handled it. It felt a little cold and abrupt. He just closed off. It also seemed like he tried to blame it on me rather than hold himself accountable for his feelings. He was an extremely self aware guy, aside from this conversation so it was surprising. 

I have a lot of empathy for him so while I’m hurt and a little angry about how he handled our final conversation, I can’t say anything really bad about him. I truly can’t. He treated me so well.. he will be tough to top! I know, however, that the separation timeline and ex wife dynamic 

I’m not going to wait for him or hope he will come back. It would just bring me comfort to believe that those feelings we felt for each other didn’t just disappear. Because I feel a little sad and discouraged about dating in general. Things felt very right and comfortable and it makes me afraid to connect with people or be even happy. And if I am that guarded then I’ll only push people away.

So, any insight from someone who’s been the guy in this situation, or experienced something similar, who could offer some reassurance or perspective that prevents me from throwing that wall up and not allowing myself to connect with people .. that would be great!",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/q2hbx9/looking_for_a_little_reassurance/

98,q2jyvc,1633525259,In my first situationship and I’m a little lost. Can someone explain some things like I’m 5?,"I’ve been out of a 10ish year relationship for over a year. 

Went on a date with a guy I met on hinge and I got so excited. I’m not ready for a relationship but it was my first date with someone new as an adult. Didn’t think I’d meet anyone I actually would like tbh 

We hit it off on our first date over drinks, had a nice dinner as a second date. He was so dreamy and sweet, he was a little too smooth but it was different and I liked him. The romance of it all really got me. Then we had a Netflix and chill date that ended in sex and then we did that twice a week for about a month. 

I went out of town for over a week and I’m back. I think I want to keep sleeping with him but I feel kind of anxious. I don’t have real feelings for him but I do feel like it’s possible I might catch feelings because he’s a great guy and we have great chemistry. 

The issue is that now that im back I feel disconnected from him. I don’t really know him much and romance from the first two dates has worn off and I’ve been warding off other guys because I feel weird talking to them while having sex with someone. 

Is it weird to ask for dates to reconnect? is how im feeling a sign that I’ve lost interest? 

I’m also anxious because idk where this is going and I don’t know how to ask without it sounding like I want a relationship because I don’t think I do. 

Any advice would help! Really inexperienced and I grew up kinda ugly but now everyone thinks im attractive and it’s really confusing. Thanks!",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/q2jyvc/in_my_first_situationship_and_im_a_little_lost/
