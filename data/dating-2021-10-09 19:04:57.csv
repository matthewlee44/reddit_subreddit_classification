Hey! 14 year old lesbian here.  


So, recently, I've been wanting a girlfriend. I have discovered that I'm lesbian a while ago, but only recently have I actually wanted a girlfriend.  


I see all my friends be happy with people of the opposite sex and, you know, I deserve to be happy too!  


But, problem is, I haven't met anyone gay/bi/etc., and, honestly, I don't know how!  


Obviously I'm too young to go to gay bars, and in my region, there is slim to no LGBT+ events or groups that I can join.

  
So, maybe in my school there are gay people. But how do I even know? And, well, I'm too shy to just come up to someone who I'm not even sure is gay!  


So, if there's anyone here who's been through this before, or is going through this, or even just got some advice, feel free to tell me!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q4xn2l/need_help_getting_a_girlfiend_lesbian/

 years of my life , as in I'm sure i got held behind  that many because of it.  theres people my age getting married and buying there first house and meanwhile I'm still trying to even to find a career or even a good enough job to move out of my parents house. it feels emasculating and pathetic at my age especially knowing I avoided any relationships because I was so stressed all those years. 

 At this point the only thing im not paying for is rent. im completely self sufficient and am in the process of building my credit so a lease agreement will be easier. Thanks to our wonderful healthcare system even with good insurance im still paying 375 a month for therapy out of pocket.  I make just enough at my job for living with a roommate but dont' have any friends near me for that option. I'm Planning on starting trade school next year because im tired of working dead end jobs that land me nowhere but home.

9,q4xr4u,1633826565,I’m over love/relationships,"I’ve been single for ten years (I’m 28M). Recently, I’ve been seeing all my friends on social media getting married, having families and having a great life. Because of these feelings, I can’t help but feel like I’m missing out on life because of that. 

My ex gf from high school was verbally abusive towards me, cheated on me behind my back and refused to ever have sex due to her religious beliefs and I respected that. Turns out after she dumped me, she fucked him thus I’m a 28 year old virgin who’s never even seen a woman naked and I feel left out that I’ve never had such a connection with anyone. She pretty much made me feel like I’m not worthy of anyone’s love

I just hate seeing all these couples in public holding hands, kissing and teasing with each other. Now for those of you who say I should try dating apps, don’t. I’ve tried Tinder, Bumble, Facebook Dating and OkCupid. Every time I matched, it was for a fake profile, causing me to think that if I was even worthy of love. After about four years on those apps, I gave up and deleted them. 

Every time Valentines Day comes around, I have to control my inner anger because everyone is talking about plans and each time I’m in public, I have to force myself to ignore advertisements or whenever I’m watching TV, I look at my phone and ignore it. 

I’m sorry if I’ve soured anyone’s mood about this but I just needed to tell someone. Thank you for letting me tell my story.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q4xr4u/im_over_loverelationships/
10,q4xsh0,1633826717,Does she likes me ?,"There is this girl in my class, I wouldn't lie I am attracted to, that's why I need outside opinions to be sure I am not imagining things.

It all started when we had a small talk at the beginning of the school year, so I can invite her in the class group I created on whatsapp, since this time I swear to god I felt like she was staring at me like crazy in the bus, and it happened multiple times. An intense staring not the ""Look away"" kind of staring from what I've seen. In fact, I was the first to look away, that's what made me initially think that after all I must imagine things and muh she just happened to look in my direction.

Then we happened to talk there and there. It was happening most of the time because she would kind of subtly eavesdrops in the conversation I had with my friends reacting to something I was saying, and it was usually moving to more casual talking especially with her. I wouldn't say at that point we were ""friends"" or something. But not strangers to each others for sure.

A few days after that I was with my buddies sitting at a table at the university and we were talking, and I see her coming with her friend and she clearly put herself in a ""talk to me"" position but without initiating, I was the one to automatically initiate a casual conversation with her, including her friend in the conversation obviously.

Then yesterday she made that thing that made me wonder what's her interest in me : (Like I said I don't consider we are currently actual ""friends"", we've talked from time to time so we're definitely not strangers to each other but we're definitely not comfortable as friends, at least that's not how I feel about it on my own. ) I enter in the big amphitheater of the school for a math course, I see her at the at the back of the amphitheater, she was all alone. I put myself in the middle of the amphitheater, definitely far enough from her so. I sit down, I take out my things, 1 minute later I turn my head back : And there she is RIGHT BEHIND ME she moved from the back of the amphitheater to the row right behind me without ANY explainable reason. I smile at her, she smiles at me so I move forward a few chairs while staying on my row so we can talk a little (She's behind me so), casual talk as usual honestly. After the course I talked with her a bit waiting for the bus and she touched my shoulder while saying something.

The problem is that when we talk she's not there to tell me she's crazy about me or anything like that, it's casual talk. I have no doubt that when she moved right behind me out of nowhere is a gigantic room it was to have more chance to initiate a potential conversation. But for what purpose then? Is it romantic? Am I kidding myself and it's purely friendly ? Like girls are like that sometimes with guys just to establish a friendly bond, without any romantic interest ?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q4xsh0/does_she_likes_me/

I’ve been on and off the dating apps for years. I’ve been on bumble for about two weeks. While I get matches, guys stop replying to messages early on or the convo just dies out naturally. (F 26), I’ve just never gotten dates easy like other women I know. I’ve been told I’m picky but everyone should be selective to some degree. I wonder if I really want a relationship, considering I don’t really have desire to have sex. I haven’t had sex in three years and don’t care if I never have it again. When I get messages on dating apps and convos seem to go well early on, I get discouraged as soon as the conversation fades. I feel forced then to try matching with more guys.

So, getting straight to the point, when i'm texting with her, one time she texts me first, double texts me, replies fast and shows me huge interest in the convo and the other time she replies very dry with the words like ""oh okay"", ""ok"", ""oh"", ""damn"", doesn't text me and seems like she isn't interested. I noticed that she is interested the most when she is bored, alone or doesn't do much at that time, however she doesn't gaf about me when she's with other people.

It really bothers me.. Does she really like me? Is she only talking to me for fun? Am i just overthinking? Is she using me only for attention? Is what she does a normal thing? I've been overthinking that for the past week and my thoughts start to be very unhealthy for my mentality and my relation with this girl.

can men please answer is my theory correct? if you are a guy who slow fades or ghosts. can you answer below what reasons made you do that?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q4ztdc/men_who_ghostslow_fade_after_sex_why_is_it_cos/
41,q4zvur,1633835115,"For some reason, my parents, friends and even my coworkers are trying to put pressure on for me to date.","So details is I'm 26, working a regular job, saving money up so I can eventually move out of my current state. Because of this, I don't have a lot of time to date. But I figured it wasn't a big deal, because I'm only 26, and the way I see it, I should focus on getting my life in order before I start dating. So for me, I need to focus on getting my own house first. Since right now I'm living with my brother and sister. 

But the weird thing is that they all keep trying to put pressure on me to date. My parents at least I can understand since they want more grandchildren and they only have one. My sister is constantly trying to pressure me to date by telling me 'Oh women like this, and they don't like things that you're into.' 

Okay again, thats just family, so its not that big of a deal.

But then my friends started asking me why I haven't started dating anyone yet, and they keep trying to set me up on blind dates. Which I usually don't want to go on, and I don't feel comfortable with when they're going on.

One time I told a girl my plans to move out the current state, and she said she thought it was stupid on our blind date. So that didn't go well.

Now its gotten to the point where my co workers are trying to make me go out with another one of our co workers who I have NO interest in.

I just don't understand why I have all these people trying to tell me 'Hey you need to date."" 

I'm not shy about women. Its just that I need to focus on getting ahead first. Again, I'm not going to date unless I have my own place first.

And its also my personal life, so I don't see why so many of them are trying to get involved. 

I got my own issues to worry about. And personally i don't think I'll be worth much dating material wise until i'm at least 30.

But now people are like ""No! You need to do it now!"" At first I was willing to dismiss it as just banter, but its gotten to the point where I get messages saying 'Yo i got a date for you!"" Even though I didn't ask for it.

One of the 3 was single, and we hit it off and chatted all night. Didn't even dance, nothing intimate, just lots of chemistry. 

Throughout the night, she kept asking me if I'm going to text her the next day (today). She kept telling me that ""guys always say they'd take her out but never follow through"". I shared with her that in my experience, she's likely never going to remember me or text me back. She made me ""shale on it"" that I would take her out to dinner tomorrow. This back and forth went on all night, and her friends made me ""promise"" that I'll reach out today. 

So, I made reservations to her favorite restaurant (gathered Intel from her friend) and texted her about it today. She never responded. 

I honestly feel sick that this keeps happening. Ladies, why do that? Why push the issue and beg for attention, only to not even have the decency to respond? 

I get it, this was at a nightclub where I'm sure stuff like this always happens. But she insisted on me reaching out and made me promise. She even texted me when she got home, but then this morning I noticed she removed her social media stories that included me.

I wonder - when you get married, what are your thoughts about your previous boyfriends/girlfriends, if any?

The post was a 14yo girl seeking advice on how to get a partner. Someone commented suggesting going on online groups…. Please STOP ENCOURAGING CHILDREN to explore their dating life online, we shouldn’t even encourage them making friends online. THEY DONT KNOW THESE PEOPLE. That is so unsafe! It takes very little information for a predator to locate a child. And young teens can be very easily manipulated into thinking situations are safe if they “meet in public” or “video chatted” or “talked on the phone and sent photos back and forth”. Our youth are being exploited, raped, trafficked, kidnapped every day already without online playing a factor, and are at a higher risk when they’re interacting with literal strangers! There is a false sense of security. As a woman who was very fortunate to have escaped a similar situation as a young teen I seriously seriously urge that we instead teach children to form real life bonds with people, even if it’s just friendship and not focusing on relationships until later on, and how to be safe with their online activity.

It honestly shocks me a bit to see how people whine about how they'll never find love, they only want someone to love them forever, etc. It's so one-sided. A loving relationship is about reciprocity. 

The person you wind up with is *also* looking for their soulmate, to be loved and comforted, made to feel wanted and safe just like you are. They are not an NPC put on this earth solely to love you and make you feel good. They are going to have expectations you must meet in order for them to feel satisfied in the relationship.

Instead of focusing on what it is you stand to gain from dating, maybe instead cultivate what it is you're bringing to the table. How do *you* love? How do you communicate? What are your skills and hobbies? How do you make people feel good? What are your dating weaknesses and how are you working on them? 

You must give in order to receive. Reciprocity. People will sense when you are just selfishly looking to fulfill your own desires and want nothing to do with it.

63,q51zkp,1633844291,Is it better to drop dating apps and just blindly meet people spontaneously?,"(M, 25) Like a lot of guys, Tinder has been laughably bad for me. I'm at a university in a 160,000 population city in a metro area that includes Atlanta and a smaller city, and remarkably I've gotten way less likes than in my old 7,000 population town in rural west TN. Strange isn't it. I wrote a bio and had pictures that have helped me in my old town and that helped me on Instagram. I guess a lot of girls don't get on dating apps. I look good for reference, and I run. I can go for a half marathon even. Not ranting, just trying to grasp the dating game. BTW I had a fling a few years ago, so I'm not totally new to this. Just new to the dating aspect still.

 The other day, I randomly heard a girl talking to someone about how she's studying abroad in spring (I am too) and I asked her about it, to make a friend. And it was just natural. I even got her number. Not saying it means anything relationship wise, but I think that's the first step you take in dating someone. Make a friend from having common interests, get to know them, and it can go from there. I guess I just have niche interests that most people don't care about, which makes dating feel kinda bleak. But talking to that girl felt much more real than fighting for relevance on a shitty dating app. I think the idea is to just be where a large amount of people are (unlike my old town), making it more likely to meet someone you match with. I had a similar experience when I got to college in August. 

Meeting those girls randomly and talking to them about shared interests just seemed like the actual way that you start to date. It all suddenly made sense somehow. I just had to be in an area with a lot more people my age. So since most of you are probably much better at dating, is it best to not use Tinder and just meet people randomly?

So I am speaking to this lady whom I've been friends with for quite some time and we just started to rekindle our friendship since she just got out of a relationship ( 8 years that she has been dating this dude) and is starting to at least dip in her toe back into the dating world . So my thing is that I am just playing the role as her supporting cast and just trying to help her wound heal quickly as possible in a sense of her breaking up with her ex. Remind you guys, she is still living with the guy but yet she tells me that she is trying to get out but of course her ex still tends to her needs and loves her dearly . Despite of all this , she still goes out on randoms dates with other people (because she is on hinge) and does her own thing. How do I know this? She would mention this to me here and there on our texts. Now this is where things get a little complicated on my end . She is a medical assistance and she works very late at night. I would text her and we would speak to like 5A.M in the morning and she gets out around 7 A.M. I don't mind it because at the moment I am not working plus I am a night owl so I am usually up at that time anyways . But lately she hasn't been responding to my texts and we went out a couple of weeks ago. We didn't do anything too special because she was meeting with one of her coworkers so our time together was pretty short. That time we spent together wasn't necessarily planned . She just called me up because she so happened to be in the city getting her hair done so I guess she just wanted to kill time which wasn't an issue for me. Again, I enjoy the talks we had through via text but I didn't want this to be our first hangout you know what I mean? Now ever since that day we hung out she hasn't been responding to me as much . So now my thinking is do I

1. Tell her how I feel and go from there?
2. Do I express my emotions and ask her what is going on ? Would this help me derail these negative thoughts?
3. Do I do nothing and continue to text her until she replies ?

From what I’ve observed, most straight Caucasian girls in relationships have boyfriends that have strong masculine features such as a sharp forehead, strong cheekbones and jaw. My facial features are much softer than those guys. My face doesn’t assemble the Top Gun era Tom Cruise, but more like kpop stars (A bunch of ppl on Omegle told me I look like a BTS member?)

I’ve always been insecure about my physical appearance. Is having a baby face or soft masculine features a turnoff to western girls?

I had just moved to this town and was very open. I found him charming, intelligent and attractive right away. I asked him out and during our date he told me that he was in an open relationship and lives with his girlfriend ""like roommates"" and they are very free (he compared her to a p**nhub actress - I know, charming). I was tipsy, so I invited him back home. Next day I decided to break it off given that I did not consider him available. We met again though our hobby and I could barely function - I was that attracted to him. We spent the next three months texting multiple times per day and having sex occasionally. Yesterday we were out with common acquaintances and someone commented on his *wife and child*. I almost had an aneurysm right there and then. I felt mislead and horrible, as him having a child crossed a line for me. 

Of course couples can have a family and be open, but I feel that he intentionally hid information from me. And obviously I had other hopes, though I was trying to keep me feet on the ground. 

I have been alone and very lovely for a very long time and now on top of that I feel disoriented and miserable. I had some very bad experiences in the past and the situation awakens similar feelings in me.

The thing is, I feel like dinner is too much of a whole thing for a first meet up . I barely ever go out to dinner with anyone let alone a stranger. The idea of sharing a meal while sitting across from a stranger makes me feel incredibly anxious. Its not about eating in front of others (I mention that because I know people who have that issue) I prefer going for a walk in the park or something along those lines. 
It feels more comfortable to me because I don’t have to sit face to face, there’s less pressure and less decision making. Additionally, if either party wants to leave at any time, it’s easier. Oh and also I can bring my dog along which is very comforting and he’s well liked by strangers.

77,q533nh,1633849639,Expecting to fall in love over a certain age is questionable,"This idea of mine has arisen after reading and hearing of a few people who expected to fall in love while they were in their fifties.

After getting a divorce from their wife whom they have been married to for a long time, they expect to find the perfect woman for them and fall in love in their fifties.
I understand we all have an inner need to deeply connect with a human being and I also try to not be judgemental BUT I can't help thinking it is ridiculous or at least highly unlikely.

I am in my late twenties and I have found dating to be well...inexistent so far for me and thus difficult to find someone compatible to me. I can't imagine how difficult it is for someone in their fifties, with children attached and a whole lot of responsabilities that need to be worked out around the other person's life. 
Not to mention, not to mention, the emotional labour you have to go through in order to build a relationship. It is tiring! How can someone past a certain age still have the inner resources to put themselves through so much effort considering, that is, that they have indeed found that compatible person to them. 

I see people past a certain age (let's say fourty onwards) who are now enjoying the fruit of their relationship that they have grown in their younger years. It seems they are more settled. I don't know quite how to describe it... probably that you have gerown with someone throughout the years and when you reach a certain age you start enjoying what you have built. As opposed to growing on your own or with someone else throughout the years and then splitting up and then getting in and out of relationships or encounters and just ending up lost.

Brief introduction: fell in love with a man, he fell in love with me, seemed very secure about our future, promised me so many things, the whole lot. I believed everything, we had intimate contact and right after that bam! everything ended.

I know where I went wrong. He wanted physical contact, he said he was coming after a long period of abstinence, so he really wanted it. I don't know what happens in the male's brain in this context, but he definitely started seeing me more enhanced than I actually am. He put me on a pedestal and sang love songs to me. AND I LOVED IT. My ego loved the attention, the compliments, everything. So I kept feeding this instead of stopping it and taking it slowly. I started lresenting myself in such a way that would feed his imagination. Then when his erotic desire was consumed, of course there was nothing else left. He didn't develop the desire to know who I was as a person because I didn't direct things in that way. I was all about ""look at me how beautiful I am"", ""look how well this dress fits me"" and all that.

What I have learnt us that compliments may be flattering to a girl's ego, but I didn't know back then who was talking. By this I mean to say that it wasn't him as a person who was talking, but rather his sexual desire. None if us knew this and it is fine. It is a lesson for me to learn and to reconsider my dating techniques.

When I woke up in her bed the next morning she was still sleeping and I looked around to realize how similar we are in the way of home/personal life. We spent some time together and it became apparent that we share many, many preferences, interests, and pursuits in life- we even study the same subject in school. I didn't expect to feel like we were two sim characters put into the same room on that fateful Friday night. During the time we shared I met her friends and siblings and all seemed to approve. Also at the time I was going through work stress and ultimately left because of the harassment from my manager. I found a new job and it fell through. With my parents deceased and friends living mostly out of town/state I felt very vulnerable and lost some confidence in regards to employment. This in turn highlighted my anxious attachment style as I began over communicating and trying to see her too often. As a result she broke things off. I'm kicking myself over it because if I had realized her attachment style and sense of security I would've given her a lot more space. It doesn't feel like I'm going to find someone like her again and with how I reacted to the stress it didn't highlight how choosy I am with who/what I spend time on, only my anxiety. Her friends mean a lot to her, as they should, and I'm very sure I've lost their approval- which I can't blame them for.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi ladies, I know this could be a sensitive topic. But I would really appreciate it if you ladies can offer me some good advice.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m 22 years old this year. I came to study in Canada from an Asian country. In high school at my home country I was considered a funny, smart and above average looking person. My English was very good and my all friends were very jealous of me. I also had plenty of girlfriends in high school. These experiences indeed have boosted my confidence and opinion on myself about my appearance. Back then I really dreamed of being wild in university, like hooking up with different attractive women from everywhere. Be both the hot smart guy in my university.

&amp;#x200B;

However, my actual experience in a Western university in Toronto totally made me feel down and confused about myself and what to do next. I had so many first dates with attractive strangers, I had courage to walk up to any girl in my school to ask them to go on a date with me. But I still find it hard to get laid, I have only got laid several times with slightly good looking women on tinder. And my tinder matches are getting fewer and fewer each month til I stopped using it.

&amp;#x200B;

At first I thought it was because of my fashion style, so I went on to spend some efforts onto finding myself some good looking outfits. But it was still hard, so i thought it was because I was too skinny without muscles, so I started keeping going to workout every other morning. I have also spend days going out to night clubs with friends. But eventually, none of what I did improved my luck with beautiful women. I just don’t know what I did wrong. I have never received proper PE back in my high school but I managed to find my own path. I honestly feel very proud of myself not playing video games and have so many hobbies.

&amp;#x200B;

So I feel really down, especially when seeing a 6 feet tall white bulk footballer had it so easy with a really hot white girl in my school. But I never had anything like that happened to me even though I tried so hard to improve myself. And it is also a hard topic to talk with parents or friends cuz people would just say I’m horny. But I know everybody wants what I am pursuing.

&amp;#x200B;

So can somebody tell me what I can do about this? I would really appreciate your advice and want to figure out my frustration.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5466n/what_advice_can_you_tell_a_young_man_struggling/

at his current location but i couldn’t make it since it was really far from my place. But I did offer to meet somewhere in the middle and he said that he cannot leave his mom alone for long hence it won’t be possible(which was totally understandable) so we planned of meeting before he leaves to his hometown at a common point(which didn’t happen) and two days later he told me that he has already left. Now, he is asking me to travel to his hometown as our first date, meet him(he said for like 2-3hrs)&amp; whenever he gets urgent work he will go back to get it done &amp; that I explore the place(which is a different place altogether for me cause I haven’t been there and have no friends there) alone when he is busy and can’t be with me.

There was another instance where he didn’t reply to my messages for two days straight &amp; when I told him that it hurt me and was insensitive of him to leave the conversation in the middle he said that not to get attached to him and it shouldn bother me if he is replying or not and he doesn’t want to take the responsibility of me getting hurt. I am not understanding what the guy is actually trying to achieve because any serious relationships wouldn’t start off this way and moreover he wants me to go over to his place, can’t promise me that he will show around the place and that I spend time with myself as long as he can’t make time for me.

We talked for about 3 weeks. He seemed really interested like he would ask questions about me &amp; he didn’t come off aggressive but I could tell he’s the assertive type which is actually my type. I was also the same (i asked him questions about himself) except I’ve never texted him first whenever our conversation ends. 

So here’s how it went: after meeting up for the first time and having talked for about a week, he asked me what I was looking for but I said it’s still hard to tell bc ive only known him for a week and he said he’s the same way. After that, he started bringing up sex- like he asked about my experiences but he’s never asked me to hookup nor was he ever creepy upon asking me about my experiences. Another week has passed and he asked me again what I was looking for. I told him to go first and he said “tbh I was looking for a fwb/ hookup at first but when I’ve gotten to know you and found out you’re still a virgin, I changed my mind bc i didn’t wanna take advantage of you like that, and I think I kinda wanna date you now but I think we definitely have to hang out more to be sure about that” to which I replied along the lines of “Me too. Glad to know we’re on the same page.” 

We hung out one more time after that and he even texted me afterwards (just some small talk). He brought up sex again (again, just shared about experiences, nothing creepy). I think I told him that I was still scared to have sex and he suggested “maybe you need a practice guy” (at first I didnt realize that it was like a code word for hookup LOL). After that, he just stopped initiating texts.

97,q54m70,1633857297,Internet Dating Safety Tips," Anyone who has ever heard of the Internet, whether they have used an Internet dating service or not, is well aware of some of the dangers that dating over the World Wide Web can pose. The fact is, if you Internet dating can actually be a more rewarding experience than dating out in the “real world”, and you may even be more insulated from a negative experience on the Internet that you would be in a face to face situation. The Internet offers several screening experiences that are simply not possible when dating face-to-face, and using these opportunities to your advantage can result in an extremely successful online dating experience.  


In order to remain safe on the online dating site, start off your experience with each prospective date with caution. I recommend a step-by-step elevation process. Begin your search through the use of a screen name that others will address you as when they wish to contact you. Progressing to first names is not too big a step, but giving out your last name certainly is- do not do it until you have spent a reasonable amount of time talking to the other person and have a feel for the kind of person they are. Set up a separate email account for communicating with potential dates, and never give out any personal information on the first communications. If you feel the other person is pressing you for this information, be prepared to stop communication (if they are pressuring you on something like this already, the odds are good that you will face further pressures if you establish a relationship anyway).  


Pay a lot of attention to what the other person is saying, and make sure to register any comments they make that are suspicious or contradictory as you talk. Don’t rush into anything- you don’t have to meet until you are both comfortable. As you chat, you will both need to establish a direct and forthright rapport with each other, in order to establish the trust which is necessary for a face-to-face meeting (this is one of the unique aspects of Internet dating- the foundation of trust is already there before you have even really met, therefore if it all seems to be working out you are several steps ahead of where you would be if you had met in the flesh initially).  


Some hard evidence is always good to establish some trust and a deepening of the relationship. Request a photo, and be prepared to reciprocate. It can be daunting to send that photo, but if the goal is to meet eventually then you are going to see each other sooner or later anyway.  


Finally, when it comes time to meet, make sure it is in a highly visible area, with many other people around. Don’t be too private on the first date- dinner at a restaurant, a movie in a theater- something with plenty of other people around as you get to really know the person.  


Internet dating is growing in popularity and can be a great way to find and establish a great relationship. The mantra “there are a lot of weirdos out there” certainly rings true, but the simple fact is that this is also true in “real” life. Exercising some additional caution in Internet dating will ensure that you have safe experiences, although just like in real life they may not always bear fruit.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q54m70/internet_dating_safety_tips/

99,q54q4d,1633857830,Trouble holding conversation on apps,"Hi, I've been on a dating app again for about a month now. I've been finding it really hard to hold conversations with people I match with. I will ask an initial open ended question and they answer. Might have a few more lines, then it goes cold,not even a chance to establish anything. It's funny cause this even happens with people that specifically say they want someone who can hold a conversation.

Do others have this issue often? Am I just super boring (quite possible) at initial conversation?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q54q4d/trouble_holding_conversation_on_apps/
