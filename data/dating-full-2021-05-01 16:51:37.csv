Yesterday we went on our second date. Few hours before date she  saying how excited she was to see me. We both drank a little. We showed each other pictures of family. She’s asking all these questions about me. She was saying how if we were to have a relationship it would have to be slow. She mentioned previous relationships and how she was really hurt by the fact that 2 guys said they liked “the idea of her etc” also mentioned she’s been in some really bad relationships. 


She also asked how I’d react to arguments and if she wasn’t in this bubbly mood all the time. I told her, I don’t have blow out arguments, I work through problems and I can accept when I’m wrong. That I also don’t expect to always be happy and cheerful. We go out to the cars and there’s a lot of kissing involved. Like relationship type stuff, holding hands etc. 

We get back to hers. First we start sharing poems, and we start sharing music and the one poem she showed me was extremely intimate. We hook up, but we’re having fun and joking the whole time. I say I like you, and it would be nice to hangout more because we get along well. She goes onto say that she would need time to think and maybe we shouldn’t go on another dinner date because of how “relationshipy” it felt. I told her I understood there wasn’t pressure..but I’m like it takes 2 people for it to feel that way. 

I’m thinking if this was just casual..why didn’t you kick me out right away after we hooked up last week? Why did you also accept an invite to go out? Because I wouldn’t have pressed it.

Stop running away from conflict. Conflict is a spark. Peace does not reveal true nature of things. Every  fight you resolve brings you closer together. Arguing is mental sex. Argue on the first date. Dont waste time agreeing.

When it comes to real deal, literally no one is confident. All want to run away from even the most basic commitment and responcibilities.

No one is brave enough to show their true face. We have to waste a few months of our lives dealing with masks instead of doing that in the first week so we can move on to things that actually matter.

Been single since January, didn’t jump into OLD until April, and this is my third go-around with being single in my 20’s (first time was at 23, next 26, and now again at 29). Hinge wasn’t around the last time I was single, so I was using Tinder/Bumble at the time. Now I’m using all 3, and the landscape of dating has certainly changed, in more ways than one. Unless you’re 6’+, or a 9-10/10 guy, women aren’t looking for my type of guy until I’m in my late 20’s-30’s (women love “finding themselves” with the most attractive guys they can find. Wouldn’t you if you had the opportunity?). So now I’ve had a bit more success than I did previously, which I had expected from the get-go (and predicted when I was in my early-mid 20’s).

Perhaps some of my thoughts are based on being more cynical and practical about certain things with age; other reflections will be based on the current situation with COVID. For further clarity, I live in BC, Canada, where the landscape may be much different than in other places around the world (I’m sure this group comprises of people globally). For background, we are still under a “soft” lockdown, and are not supposed to be seeing other people, need to wear masks everywhere we go, etc.

These points are not meant to necessarily be negative, although some may sound overly pessimistic. All I’m trying to convey is the simple facts about the nature of online dating, the issues with having certain expectations, and overall coming to the conclusion that with the pandemic at the forefront, we are slowly diving into a new age where our ability to connect with others is becoming seriously compromised. I feel like I could write a book about all this stuff.. maybe I should - let’s start with a Reddit thread and see what people think.

I haven’t posted in this sub before, and I’ve seen lots of people, both guys and girls, posting/commenting about how online dating is a nightmare, people are awful, they’ve just pegged themselves as someone who will be alone forever. Much of the discussion has been quite hopeless in nature, and the narrative of “I’m a nice guy/girl, but I get no matches, I get ghosted, people don’t respond, etc” is also quite common. Granted, the population of people posting about this stuff on Reddit needs to be taken into consideration. But at the same time, since I’ve been on dating apps throughout the month, I’ve had around 6 virtual dates, 1 in person date, and get probably 1-2 matches per day. As a guy, I would consider this to have some weight behind it in terms of what I’m about to say. For further information, I’m 5’9, work in a manager position, am active and have photos of myself playing hockey and completing a triathlon, and had a professional photo shoot done with some high quality pics that are candid and have gotten great reviews from female friends. So overall, I wouldn’t call myself a hermit with no social skills - I’d consider myself someone who can carry a conversation with just about anyone, make someone laugh, and intellectual enough to connect with people as long as the effort is there on the other side. Someone who, just like most people, think they are a catch! But there’s some success so far on the dating apps that may or may not make me feel OK to say that what I’m about to say should have a bit of merit.

As we all know, women run the OLD world. Well, at least in the age demographic that I’m looking at - 21-30 - but I feel this is the way of the land across the board (but I wouldn’t know this for sure). Women in this age category can swipe blindly, and will likely get anywhere between 2-9 matches out of every 10 right swipes. If you are a woman and you swipe right on 10 people and get 0 matches, please let me know - I personally do not think this is even possible. But guys, please keep this in mind with what I’m about to say, as it is very important.

Imagine you are a woman, and after 10 minutes of swiping, you have 10 matches. These are 10 people who you felt met your criteria, and now you’re waiting for them to message you because that’s how the game works (f\*\*\* Bumble). 3 of them message you, and now you start a conversation with 3 people who meet your attractiveness standards, and have taken the initiative to send you a message. The more attractive a person is, the less this initial message matters. Yes, I said it: attractiveness is the absolute basis of OLD at this point, without a doubt. Are you going to even consider dating someone you aren’t attracted to? The answer is no. Guys: are you going to date a girl taller than you? Pretty much very likely no. So stop getting upset at women for wanting tall guys!! I used to get pissed about this, but hey, I want a girl 5’5 or shorter, don’t even consider anything above 5’6. So if a girl says “must be 6ft,” perfect, I wouldn’t be down anyways. Anyone notice that girls on OLD seem to be taller than the general population? Interesting…

And so as a woman, after 10 minutes of swiping, you have 3 people who have been filtered by your standards to meet your criteria. But guess what? After a week of this madness, you will likely have 70 matches, and 21 people who have had the decency to send you a message. All we are looking for in this world is our one person to spend time with, and give us that companionship we all crave and need. How in the world are you able to manage all this, with so much validation and choice? How will you ever know someone is worth pursuing, and responding to, when there’s another 20+ people who might be just a bit better? Might live a bit closer? Might make a bit more money? Might have a cuter dog? Might have more similar interests? Might be more different? HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO CHOOSE? Of course you are going to stop responding to some people, cherry pick the absolute hottest people of the bunch, and even then - it’s just so much validation and choice that you start forgetting the conversations you had, and start to re-think your life decisions and self worth. It’s overwhelming, it’s disheartening, and sadly, it’s the reality of the world we live in. I have talked to multiple women about this, and there is 100% truth to the above. OLD has wired us to always think “but what if there is something better out there for me?,” and this has led to the increase in our anxiety about ourselves as men and our self worth, because women are presented with so much choice, and so many questions of the “what if,” and “what else.”

To all the men out there, I want to paint a picture for you. Imagine you wake up one day, and you have 10 matches waiting in your queue. 3 of them message you, and they all seem super interested. Nice! You message them all back, and all 3 of them respond right away. Awesome! You carefully craft a response of some sort to all 3, and then head to work for the day. Feeling good about yourself! Throughout the day, you get messages from these matches, you get more notifications about new matches, and you come home after a long day and have another 10 matches, and another 4 people who have sent you a witty message. And they’re all attractive people! So now you have 7 conversations on the go, with 7 people who you legitimately could see yourself potentially going on a date with. Life is great! Look at you go, all these women just wishing you would give them the time of day for a conversation, a virtual date, a walk in the park, a drink or two, some physical companionship, etc. And only a few days later, you have conversations going with 21 people, all of which are super interested in you, likely talking to other people as well, but still attentive and dying for that first date, for that possible connection. HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO CHOOSE? Sadly, this situation does not happen for men. But if it did, please realize that you would act the same way that women have been acting to you - ghosting, distancing, being evasive, etc. Who can have 21 conversations at the same time? And the reason, is because women are so absolutely overwhelmed and in their heads about the confidence boost and validation that they’ve been given by literally the above situation, that they are desensitized to the opportunity to build a meaningful connection online. But it doesn’t end there - let’s add COVID into the mix, shall we?

Think to how the landscape of OLD has shifted with COVID. Are more people using OLD than ever before? Well, I haven’t seen any statistics, but I’m going to confidently say that the answer is yes. Is there more selection than ever before, because of the above? Yup. Is it more acceptable to continue conversations virtually, as opposed to in person? Do we all have an excuse to behave in such a way where we just stop responding to people without any reason whatsoever? Is it fair to assume that everyone is a stranger, and meeting up in person is “irresponsible” and “against the rules?” Hey, I’d be lying if I said I had a virtual date with a girl because of COVID, but met up with another girl in person because she was hot AF. If I’m a 5’9 guy saying this, imagine what a 10/10 girl would do in this situation? Think about what *any* woman would do in this situation? Confidence level through the roof! The rules have changed, we apparently have even more of an excuse to behave in such a hedonistic, cruel, judgemental way, and it’s just the beginning of the demise in our ability to connect with others. And every time we do meet with someone, match with someone, message someone, the endless choice that exists out there throws such a wrench in the opportunity to actually build a meaningful connection, that we are essentially just doomed for failure. Sure, relationships start, connections are made, and physical attraction leads to 2 people initiating an intimate relationship of some sort through OLD. I praise this platform for its ability to act as the gateway for these sorts of things, but on a much smaller scale than we glorify it all to be. But on a more global scale - we need to really understand the root cause of the negativity surrounding all of this.

Do I have any answers? No. But I do want people to realize that any loss of confidence, feelings of loneliness, and questioning of self worth is absolutely not a reflection of you, it’s the system and the landscape of OLD. If you go to a library and meet a cute girl stocking books, you’ll have a conversation with her and her only. You will have her full attention! The conversation she has with you will be much better than any virtual conversation through text, every time. And what a much better story to tell her friends! The same cannot be said with OLD.

So yeah here’s the story.

I (23F) met this guy (24M) online and I was clear with my intent that we establish friendship first and that there will be no hook-ups as I identify as a demisexual (this guy said he’s a demisexual too so I thought that’s good).

So yeah I matched with this guy and we have been talking (or should I say flirting lol) for weeks now over telegram. We have also hinted on traveling together once the pandemic is over in our country. He is very nice and I consider him the first person I met online that really clicked with me. We have so much stuff in common and our values also align with each other.

Last night while we were casually talking, he brought up about his ‘ex’ who used to study in the same university as mine (we are both working professionals now). And he casually mentioned that his ex was a guy. Ngl, I was shocked at first. But I did not pry on him nor did I ask anything about that ‘ex’ as that was not our topic of conversation. But I kept thinking about it.

My fault is that, I did not confirm if he is a gay or a bi. Sorry for the title if it seems like I just assumed but he has been flirting with me so I guess he has interest in girls too which makes him bi? Please correct me if I am wrong. Anyway, I am not really against him being bi/gay. I am openminded and I don’t look at people’s genders as long as we connect emotionally. But he just confuses me?? Lol idk if he is really /into/ me. I don’t want to pressure him to talk about it coz I want him to tell it to me when he is already comfortable sharing.

He takes a while to reply (like 3-5hrs) but he’s saying it’s because of work which I totally understand, or that sometimes he is playing online games with friends. We haven’t had an official label as it’s been only weeks of talking so I know I’m not one to demand so much from him. He is still replying and still shows interest in texting me coz he still makes effort to talk and bring up topics which I really appreciate coz I got used to always carrying the conversation lol. But yeah I am just generally confused as to his intentions.

I stopped talking to my other matches just because I am reallyyyy tired of the same cycle of talking then ends up with one ghosting the other. I am fine just talking to this guy but idk I am afraid of getting hurt. I haven’t had a relationship for 5 years and I got used to being alone but it will really painful if this one ended up one-sided.

So yeah that’s all I am sorry if this is confusing. I am not good at expressing myself and English isn’t my first language. Maybe I just want to know or hear from experiences of women in this sub who’s been in a relationship with bisexual guys?? Is what I am feeling valid or am I just assuming things?

Before you had to be 6’2+ to date her, now she just wants a man to be her height or taller. Her self esteem is higher. Before she would sleep with a man she just met. Now, she requires several high effort dates and impeccable charisma and commitment on the guys part before any physical contact is initiated. Her skin isn’t as clear, she has wrinkles and her body isn’t as fit as it used to be. So what? The stress from her work has consumed her. She has a great job, makes great money and is a total catch

Title covers the basics. I'm 31 and never been with a woman in any official capacity. Gotten drunk at a few parties and fooled around a bit, but nothing much beyond that. Lots of bad dating scenarios that had me taken advantage of, and lots of dumbness on my part that tanked friendships.

This is not a 'woe is me' post. I'm not nearly as broken up about my status as I was as a younger man. I've learned to accept the reality rather than obsess over the things 'wrong' with me.

That said, dating is hard and I'm not very good at it. I'm a deep conversation kind of person and have little tolerance for small talk or conversation that doesn't serve a purpose. My lack of confidence and general 'I-have-no-fucking-clue-what-I'm-doing' makes sense with the context of my history, but without it I feel like I just come off as a generally socially anxious person.

But I worry that I'm pushing people away. It's not exactly a light and fun conversation to have. I feel at times that it puts undue pressure on others. But that's not really where I'm at. I'm just looking for someone patient and understanding and willing to take their time with me and my awkwardness, but that feels really hard to find, and I worry sometimes that I am pushing people away by being too upfront.

Thoughts? I get stuck in my own head sometimes, but I find sounding boards to be incredibly helpful.

I met this guy at work when we were working on the same floor one day. he approached me when walking by and politely started conversation. He was actually very sweet and looked like a genuine man plus he was cute and tall. He was quite eager in me, asking me about my studies and family which I find cool (most ppl at our work don’t bother getting to know each other). Our second day working together I saw him and came up to him and he was so chill I actually liked being around him, honestly with school being stressed and covid making harder to make friends I was happy to meet a friend. I didn’t see him for about a week because our schedules were different but I knew he worked mornings so I tried to pick up a morning shift as I wanted to see him again. we saw each other the following week and I came up to him to talk, little did I know he started being assertive, as to say making strong eye contact with me, catching up to me when he’d see me walking somewhere else, I didn’t want to be quick to assume although. 

To be honest, I was kinda nervous by his behaviour. It was flattering but I didn’t want to really pay mind to it (he looks like he flirts/gets with a lot of girls). But then he tells me before the end of shift that he finds me gorgeous and would love to get to know me better. I told him he could add me on Snapchat, he doesn’t have snap so I gave him my # and he asks if we could go out and I told him I’m not going out bc of covid and he immediately says we can work something out.. I said sure. 

He started texting me non stop for about a month until I decide to ghost. I would give him hints I wasn’t interested by being vague and taking long to respond but didn’t get it. When I ghost he still continues to text and I gently reject him by mentioning my interest in someone else but I really wanna be his friend bc he actually looks like a cool guy. He seemed down but appreciates me being honest. I text him back to say thanks after a few days and he then asks me out again but this time he says although he’s interested in a few women he feels things could work between us but still accepts if I want to just be friends. This absolutely makes me furious when someone doesn’t take me seriously/ respect my answer to romantic advances. I rejected him a little harsh but definitely not to insensitively.. it was in the lines of "" I do not want to be with you . "" 

He said nothing and I was starting to feel super bad as I might’ve made things awkward for him since we work together. I also didn’t want him to ask me this a third time via text or at work. I reach back out to him apologizing for sending that rude text and that I’m seeing someone else and hope all is good and we can still be friends. He asks me to give him space after a few days of me sending that. It’s been two months since I’ve heard/seen him and I feel emotions of sadness/anger with myself. I didn’t want to be mean but I just see him as a super nice chill guy, he’s not unattractive or anything it’s just I don’t want that right now. Will he ever talk to me again ? I feel like he will tell people how rude I am and make work awkward. I’ve had bad experiences with rejecting guys, it’s scary at times. Idk if there’s something I could do to make this all go away I feel like sh*t.

Tinder. Bumble. Hinge. Coffee Meets Bagel. I call them bait traps cause I have a habit of deleting them all and then installing them a week later, seeing if I caught any matches.

Pre-COVID was already hard enough for a guy like me, but now it's just brutal. So many flaky ghosts, unenthusiastic conversations, and matches halfway across the globe. Don't get me wrong, I'm part of the problem too. I've done my fair share of ghosting. Maybe it's my frail ego wanting to feel the same power. Maybe I just became too de-sensitized to it. Maybe I was just starting to lose hope... until I met this girl.

I matched with her [30F] a month ago and it just felt different. She and I had a great back and forth through texts. She was receptive. I joked with her. She joked back with me. We set up a date, and it was a fantastic date. We laughed throughout the whole time. Before the night ended we already planned for our next date. Then a few days later, she tells me she wanted to meet even earlier. I was ecstatic; it was just all so different than the other dates. 

On our third date, we went out for a picnic nearby my place. We drank together and shared each other's lives. I shared with her things I normally wouldn't. I put down my walls around my heart and let her enter. I invited her back to my place and we put on a shitty Netflix show. Then we all know what happens next. I drove her home and on the way back, I couldn't stop smiling so much that my face started hurting.

I started getting red flags after that third date. She was slow to text back. Reluctant to share what her day was like. We hadn't set a time and day for our next date. I was getting nervous about her flaking, but I kept thinking to myself: ""this is what the old, insecure me would think. Stop it."" But the old insecure me was right. I got a text from her a week later saying that she recently met another guy that she'd like to start dating. I was crushed. Devastated. The thought of me having to go back to ground zero and go through the bullshit that is online dating... I feel so hopeless. But the worst of all is, I really liked her. I really really liked her. 

So Reddit, what I'm asking of you is to please slap and call me silly for falling for a girl I've only known for less than a month.

(In our mid 20s). After our first date I wasn’t sure I wanted to see him again because he was pretty rude to the waiter about a small mishap, which is a turn off for me. He also talked about nothing but work and said he had no real hobbies besides working which I thought was odd... After the date, he texted me nearly every single day asking how I was doing and trying to get me to meet up again. 

To be honest, I turned him down about two or three times. He was so persistent in getting a second date that eventually after a week or so I obliged. After I got to know him better and who he is as a person, I started to actually like him and see that maybe the side of him that I saw on our first day was just a one time thing out of nerves. I saw him nonstop for the next three weeks, meeting up every two or three days.. The last time I saw him, I admitted to him I liked him and that I enjoyed spending time with him. We had not slept together yet even though he had asked the last two times if I was ready, but I told him that it was something I wanted to do soon. He told me that he enjoyed spending time with me, but that he was starting to get distracted from his work and really needs to focus the next few weeks. 

He works remotely with suppliers and sometimes has to work overnight. I told him I totally understood, and that next time for him to just let me know whenever he’s not busy with work and we can meet up again. After I got home from spending the night, I waited a day or so, and he didn’t text me at all. Even just to check in. Which was strange because we usually text every single day. I texted him the next day asking like “how have you been? Everything alright?” I waited another day and still no response. I sent him a text asking if we were still OK and if he wanted to continue seeing me. Another two days went by, and no response. 

The past weekend, while he was ignoring me, he posted videos on Instagram with friends all day Saturday and Sunday partying, which really confused me. He clearly wasn’t as busy as he was making it seem, it takes 30 seconds to send a simple text. Finally, after five whole days of not hearing from him, I called him out and asked if he was ghosting me saying that if he has lost interest I’d rather him be honest, because this was very hurtful. 

He texted me back saying “We can hang out and talk, but I’m super busy and I started feeling like you require a lot of attention and that’s just not something I can provide you with how super busy I am.” I was completely thrown off. He was the one that asked me to hang out nearly every single time except the most recent time. He was the one that texted me that entire first week prying me to meet up even after I turned him down. It made no sense. I responded back to him and told him that I appreciate the honesty, that I understand how busy he is and I respect that and let me know if he wants to go out again. He never replied, and it’s been a couple days now. 

I’m just a little bit hurt and confused. Maybe I shouldn’t have told him how I felt so soon but I was so confident he felt the same way because he was the one that had been so persistent and interested at first? Almost like love bombing.

Some backstory: went out with a guy about a month and a half ago. Had a great time. He asked me out for a second date the following week, and it’s been a hassle to actually get that date ever since. 

I’ve had to cancel on him a few times now. I had to cancel because of some work stuff the first time, the second time I was super sick a couple weeks ago, to which he was very understanding. And most recently- we had arranged dinner plans for tonight. I received my first Pfizer shot yesterday and felt totally fine, until late this morning. I have been SOO spaced out all day today, can’t emphasize that enough. The thought of sitting and entertaining a dinner with alcohol just sounds impossible. 

He knew I got the vaccine yesterday and checked in. I texted him around 1 today (our reservation was for 8:30) and was totally honest. I feel like that’s plenty of time to not gets upset. 

It’s just been really bad timing lately and I genuinely would love to see him again, I’ve made that very clear. I quite literally said to him verbatim “Just let me know what works for you next week. I’m still interested!” 

He kind of left it with a vague suggestion for dinner sometime this week, but I got the hint he was a little upset. I totally understand that. If I didn’t want to go out with someone again, I wouldn’t have agreed and made a whole plan to begin with! 

Anyway, I know if this were me being cancelled on I’d probably be irked/tired too. I appreciate his persistence but also understand if things are going to fizzle.

This is part-rant and part-question. 
I’m so done with dating apps and I can’t take another ghost/abrupt end. 
I hate how accessible a new prospective date can be, and how easily we can overlook someone great because we got bored with the one we’re currently talking to. 
I tried putting myself out there a year after my last relationship ended. Started actively dating from January. But my god is it hard?!
Even after 5 dates that go well, even if we connect on multiple levels, whether I have sex with him early or wait, somehow guys just decide to up and leave. No indication, no signs, they just change their mind.
 I manage to land dates fine. And usually reach date 3-6 before things go south and the guy changes his mind. 
I’m an attractive person and I’m funny. I’ve prioritised my career and I’m at the top of my field at 25, and I’m on an upward trajectory to achieving even more. When I go on dates, I make sure that my intentions are known and that that I’m open to a relationship but it has to be the right one. That I’m not there just to hook up. 

I can at least speak for the last guy - we got along well. We spoke on the first/second date that we’re not looking to just hook up. 
Same taste in music, movies, hobbies. Same sense of humour. Had the same likes and dislikes. Same values. We had gone on multiple dates with no change in enthusiasm. We’d talk every day. 
The last date we had went so well. Even checked up on me when I got home that night. 
I have a strong feeling he just happened to come across someone on OLD and decided the grass is greener there, because that’s when the dynamic changed and he tried ghosting me from the day after the last date. I asked to see him over coffee about a week after silence from his end, just to hang out (hoping I could bring up what happened and talk to him in person when I saw him), and he just turned around and sent me some half-assed text about how there’s nothing there between us. He didn’t even have the courtesy to tell me in person or call me - it took me sending another message for him to pluck up an ounce of courage and do the bare minimum. 
The one before this guy was an army guy who for 3 months told me everything I wanted to hear, and put his best efforts in to wooing me, getting me coffees, taking me out to dinners, telling me about his life and how compatible we were, and how he had never felt anything like this before. 
Well I slept with him 3 months in, and the day after, he had me come to his house with coffee, only to tell me that he changed his mind about me. The coffee I bought him still in his hand. 
I didn’t even get to sit down lol. On top of that, he told me about a week later that he caught chlamydia from this girl he slept with before me, and that I should get myself checked. 
He initially told me that it had been about 6-7 months since he slept with someone. Now I know that he slept with someone about 2-3 months into our dating when he was the one who explicitly said that he wanted to be exclusive. 

I told myself if things with the last one didn’t work out, I’m not going back on those apps. 
So I’ve deleted them. But is it even possible to meet someone outside of the OLD world?
I live in Brisbane and we’re pretty lucky that the pandemic hasn’t affected us as badly as other places, so social spots are open. 
I just don’t think I can handle getting so invested in someone who just drops off the map. There seems to be literally no way to tell whether someone is serious about you or not. 
Can’t trust what they say, and the last guy showed that I can’t really trust his actions either. 

Tl;dr: I’ve been fuuuuckeeeedddd over by every guy on OLD so far and am so jaded but I’m also so ready to try my hand at a relationship.

I (24F) have finally found a guy (25M) (let’s call him Mike) that I’m absolutely crazy about and vice versa. We were friends first from school, but I was more so into my books than dating until the end when we realized we enjoyed talking to each other so much and think so much alike and have the same interests. So Mike and I have been talking for a year now officially and been on three dates so far (we live very far from each other so we can’t see each other as much as we like unfortunately...especially with pandemic restrictions). I have noticed recently that certain things that he has done in the past or says now can make me wary of the possibility of getting into a committed relationship with him. At first when we were talking he had let me know that the girl he was having sex with before getting involved with me wanted a serious relationship but he told her he wasn’t looking for that at the time. A week or two ago he told me he wants us to be together and I honestly feel the same. I don’t question it...it’s just I’m worried he might be a cheater or player or something and it scares me because I already like him A LOT (some days I’m scared I like him more than he likes me but he honestly thinks he simps for me hard lol).

The problem issss I’ve never known a good, healthy example of love, a relationship that’s a true partnership. And honestly the duration of this pandemic has opened my eyes that I don’t even have a lot of people I can trust because of past hurt and because how my own father cheated and abused my mother. The distance the pandemic has forced on us is also most likely what’s been causing my second guessing. With Mike he explained to me that he has cheated in the past, I’m wavering between whether it was cheating or not since he wasn’t even in a relationship with her just benefits (I’m leaning more towards it wasn’t but he just says it is since it hurt her). And also Mike used to say things to test (I know it’s bad borderline toxic) if I’d get jealous or to see if I really liked him. Anyway that’s literally all that has happened, I know no one is perfect so I can’t put his past against him but I seriously feel like I have major trust issues when it comes to relationships and this is about to be my first! I just don’t want to be another naive woman that gives a man multiple chances like a fool, but I also don’t want to be super toxic and distrustful.
