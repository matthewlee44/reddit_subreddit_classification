So then I just stop talking to her or trying, I took the hint, right?
Then she notices and will try to get my attention at work, try to talk to me, so about 1-2 times I would start talking to her again after a month or a few.
Same outcome.

 Lately it felt different, wasn't talking to her for months, so I'm leaving work and she rushes to catch up to me and walk out together, we talk a bit and I mention I see she tweeted she wants to go to the zoo and she says something like ""yeah your always down to hang out and we definitely should go! I want to do things this summer"" or something.
She's been like ""aw were closing together Tuesday!"" And ""I will lyk what day to hang bc  I take things day by day and forget everythinggg"" then she tells me all the days she's off.  Shes been asking how my days been which is new.
We both went to a small party the other day and she was friends with everyone there but messages me like ""I'm hereeee, can you come outside I don't want to walk in alone 😂""

I'm not the best looking guys, but she seen I been going to the gym and that I had been talking to another girl 2 months before, I'm confident in myself but not the best at small talk, but she comes up to me a lot to talk or show animal tiktoks lmao(everything she posts is about her pets on social media)
We're both introverts, both mid 20's, she's dated 2 people, she dumped her last guy after years because he treated her pretty shitty.  Sometimes I can be playful and she'll be like""omg IHY 😂😂""
But then how many times have I tried to do things together and it never happens...?

For some background, I(25f) and my best friend(27f) have been best friends for 5 years. In past relationships, she backed away from our friendship and when I’ve told her how it made me feel, it only caused arguments. With the guy she’s dating now, it seems extremely serious and I don’t want to say anything that would result in her not being my friend at all. 

In the past 5 years, we text almost every day and hang out at least once a week. And for the Reddit psychs, yes I guess I formed a co-dependency (my bad). But since her new man and her have been longtime friends, they’re hitting the gas pedal on this relationship, which is ultimately leaving me in the dust. We went from constant communication and stupid gamepigeons all day to me basically waiting around for her when she remembers other people exist. 

When I get in relationships, I make sure to devote time to friends, but per reading other Reddit posts, putting your friends on a back burner when you’re in a relationship is okay to do? I am happy that they have found love but damn it hurts feeling like I was only there as a filler until the right guy came along. 

I got a little off task here, but my questions are 1. How do you cope with feeling completely alone after having a bestie who was formerly right by your side?
And
2. Is it really normal to put your friends to the side for a relationship? I haven’t been doing that while interested in someone but should I be?

But this is something that I wonder about every now and then, and finally want some outside perspective.

I've been going to the Starbucks by my house for a few years, and pretty much all the girls there are very pretty and were really friendly towards me. I used to work at a Starbucks myself though, and had a bunch of female coworkers there, so I knew they were just doing their job by being nice to me (whenever one of my female coworkers was interested in a male customer, some would make it super obvious, while others remained just polite towards the guy despite gushing about them all the time). 

But there was this one female barista at my regular Starbucks that was much more friendly to me than the other girls there: she would constantly offer or give me free drinks, make my drink immediately despite there being a line of orders ahead of me, laugh at pretty much everything I said, and ask to take over register whenever I was about to order and then move back to bar to talk to me when handing me my order. After a few months, I finally caved and as we were making small talk I asked ""Well I gotta head out now, but, actually, I was wondering if maybe I could get your number and talk to you sometime?"" I remember her eyes instantly  widened up. She looked to the side for a moment and then back to me, and awkwardly said ""Oh, uh, maybe not right now? There's actually a lot going on"" followed by a small chuckle. I told her it was totally fine, no worries, tried to insert some humor, and then left on a friendly note. I kept going back to the Starbucks, since it was the most convenient location for me, but never asked for her number again, no longer made small talk (but remained polite with her whenever she took my order), and never looked in her direction of I didn't have to because I didn't want her to think I was still checking her out or something. I didn't want to risk making her uncomfortable at all. Every now and then she would try to make small talk when handing me my drink, and a lot of times I would notice her staring at me through the corner of my eye, but I wouldn't engage (again, I didn't want to make her uncomfortable. I didn't want to be that guy who couldn't take a hint). Eventually, the pandemic hit, and she quit Starbucks during that time. Even now I wonder if I made the right choice in no longer pursuing her.

My ex of 4 years and I are making the right steps to get back together... I admitted that I slept with someone during our breakup last year. (It was 8 months after our breakup &amp; felt like it was ready for me to date) anywho, this guy and I  had sex 3x in one day that put me in the ER the next couple of days. (He bruised my cervix). After this guy and I had sex, I knew it felt wrong &amp; knew right there and then it wasn’t going to work out.

So my ex comes back into the picture after that month of the incident. (November 2020)
I knew if we were ever going to get back together I would have to tell him because I feel like it’s the right thing to do. I don’t want to keep secrets &amp; he deserves to know regardless if we were broken up. Trust me, it causes less problems in the future.

Ok, I told him this in December of 2020 that I had sex in October 2020 with That guy, my ex was in shock and asked a few questions and accepted it and left it as that, which took me by surprise because I can see he was bothered but kept it together and I knew something was sus.

Soooo now it’s May 2021 and my ex and I are really taking this serious &amp; feel like we’ve done so much improvement and getting to a better place.

Well, this weekend he just told me he had sex with some chick in March 2019 when we had our first break up... and when we started talking again in August 2019 he couldn’t tell me... and he felt like if we are going to get back together and get married he needs me to know and get passed through it together before his family finds out we are together (his mom doesn’t like me and the girl he slept with is someone his mom wanted him to be with)

Boy oh boy, I was in shock, jealous, and even felt betrayed, even though we were broken up and I slept with someone else I felt all these things. I began to snap out of it and be rationale. I failed miserably because every night I think about why couldn’t he tell me 2 years ago. 

I have to admit.... I think about her... like did he satisfy him better (stupid of me it was TWO years ago)
Is she prettier than me.lol I’m going psycho huh. What’s wrong with me?

He makes me feel loved and he apologized and regrets it all and told me he was in a bad spot and he thought about me around that time Nd knew he still was in love with me. He said the sex meant nothing and shortly after they stopped talking.

I've done OK dating friends and acquaintances - but meeting women at bars or out in public has never been my strong suit. I think that a large part of it is that I don't want to make women uncomfortable with unwanted advances, so I rarely even try. 

Lately, the downsides of being single have really started to set in so I've been trying to be more courageous when it comes to approaching. That said, what happened earlier today was quite out of character for me, and in retrospect, I went about it the entirely wrong way. 

I stopped into a local shop to grab a present for a mom's birthday and spent a few minutes chatting with the girl behind the counter. She was being friendly and talkative (as she is paid to be!), and so my female-attention-starved brain took it as a sign of interest.

 Anyway, I leave but then decide to head back a minute or so later - determined to ask for her number. Some other customers are walking in at the same time and she goes to assist them. After she greets them I get her attention and ask if she has a second. I got a little panicked so I basically just ask for her number with no lead-up or explanation or anything, and she understandably declines.

 I'm well aware that for the most part women dislike being put into that kind of uncomfortable position by customers, so making a move like that was bound to go over like a lead balloon. But for some reason, my ego takes over and instead of just being like ""OK no worries, have a nice day!"", I say, ""Oh, are you seeing someone?""

B) The only reason she could POSSIBLY not be into me is that she's already taken 

So she gets visibly uncomfortable and I get the hint, wish her well and leave, never to return.

I realized what a douche I must have seemed like pretty much immediately after leaving. I guess all I can do now is learn from it and try to do better in the future. I'm not sure if there is a proper way to express interest to someone in customer service, but this was definitely not it.

So what have we learned? 

1) People working in customer service are obligated to be nice, don't mistake this as romantic interest and certainly don't put them on the spot after a 5 minute conversation.

2) If she says no, the answer is no and her reasons are none of your concern. Wish her the best and politely screw off.

3) Don't dwell on rejection or fear taking a chance, but make sure that it's an appropriate time and place to shoot your shot.

All in all, I'm glad I went for it. The world didn't end, I learned a valuable lesson, and got out of my comfort zone.

Soo, I recently got back in contact with an old friend after literally 10 years. We’ve never met, but we live in the same city and we once exchanged “pics” when we were like 16 and we’ve always been quite flirty.

Off the bat, things were flirty again and he told me how I’ve always been beautiful and I Iightly flirted back. I’m a single mother to a toddler after my son’s dad got a traumatic brain injury which resulted in a personality change and safeguarding issues after I was pregnant, but that’s another story. I understand kids aren’t for everyone when it comes to dating and that’s partially why I’m not bothered about finding someone else atm.

He asked me out for a drink after asking if I was single, and I politely declined saying he’s handsome but it feels too soon and I have my hands full with a toddler and I wasn’t intending to date again, at least for a while. Straight away, he became defensive saying that it’s a shame I said no, and that just because he asked me out for a drink doesn’t mean it’s a date or that he wants anything lol. So I thought, that settles it and I’ll never hear from him again and I can just get on with my day.

Anyway, every day since he’s been getting into conversations with me and lightly (now) flirting here and there and tonight he asked me out for a drink again as “friends” saying he think we’d be amazing friends and that OBVIOUSLY there’s no sexual attraction whatsoever.

Here’s the interesting thing though, I’ve found myself changing my mind and seeing him as relationship potential, but I feel this situation is too much of a mindf*ck that I’m wanting to drop him completely.

One of the things we talked about was happiness with being alone. You see, it was not until I was 25yrs old when I first entered a relationship.

But now, as I go through a recent breakup with my first relationship, I realized that those years I spent alone with myself was not a waste at all. In those years, I realized that I never really felt the need to be with somebody to feel complete, to feel happy. As I live my life on my own, I learned to find happiness without needing anyone to be by my side. And that's also probably the reason I don't feel the need to immediately replace my ex with another lover just so I could forget and move on.

I realized that even when I was still single, I was in a happy world. The only difference when I had a partner is that I got to share that happy world with a special someone.

I hate dating so much. I’m in my mid twenties, and I really only started prioritizing dating in the past couple years. I didn’t date much at all as a teenager, as my priorities were always school, family, sports, etc. This continued through college as well. Once I finished school, I moved to a new city, took awhile to get settled, then really started putting an emphasis on dating. I suck at it. Since I never dated much before, I have the dating skills of a teenager. I’m not smooth, I’m fairly shy, and I take awhile to open up, which doesn’t make for a great combination when resorting to dating apps where there are so many options that the first impression counts for everything.

Recently though, I thought I finally turned a corner in dating. I met a girl on bumble, and we went out three times. It didn’t work out as we both realized we didn’t have much chemistry, but it was the most successful dating experience I’ve had in a long time. I was confident moving forward with dating, to the point that I scheduled a date with a new Hinge match the next week instead of taking a few weeks between dates like I usually do. 

The Hinge date was great! It was the first time that I thought a first date went really well. We clicked immediately and the date lasted over three hours. She told me at the end of the date that it was really fun and that she wanted to see me again. I was really excited about dating for the first time in a long time. We agreed to go out again the following week, and would figure out the details closer to then (red flag). We texted a little bit in the meantime just to keep the conversation going. She would sometimes take awhile to respond, but I figured she was just not always on her phone. She would ask me questions to keep the conversation going, so I didn’t think too much of it. But once it came time to make plans to go out, she ghosted me. 

This is why I hate dating. Whenever I get my hopes up, I just get let down again and again. It stresses me out. I would love to be able to snap my fingers and skip ahead to being married with kids. I want to get to that point, but getting there is torture. I hate it. 

I don’t want this to sound like I’m just some sad sack though, wallowing in self-pity. I consider myself a catch. I get a lot of matches on dating apps, I have a good job, and a good group of friends. I just find modern dating to be extremely frustrating. 

We have too many options, swiping through a virtually unlimited supply of potential dates. We chase perfection which is always potentially a swipe away. We give up on people for the slightest flaws. I’m not above it, I’m picky to a fault. But it’s a viscous cycle that makes us all miserable.

I've developed app (web &amp; mobile) with the intention to make dating safer for women.

You can learn more about the app here [https://vimeo.com/557098193](https://vimeo.com/557098193)

And you can also see short demo of the mobile app (Android) here [https://vimeo.com/557296122](https://vimeo.com/557296122)

The app has been tested in development but it is now seeking group of female volunteers to test it  
 and to provide much needed feedback.

In order for Google to allow you participate as a tester we need your email address.  
 [https://forms.gle/pNvG33dX51w5apn16](https://forms.gle/pNvG33dX51w5apn16)

note: All accounts created and men added to the app while testing will remain on the app only for 48 hours. Everything is deleted in 48 hours intervals. For security reasons.

The app is here to serve women.

Last night, a question came up at a friends party about when the last time everyone had sex. The asker clarified that we had to answer the last people before me and the girl, to not have boring answers. The girl said to remember back when her German “friend” was visiting, and revealed that was actually a FWB situation while he visited for a few days. 

I suddenly realised that she didn’t come to a group event that was on because she said her German friend was in town. That group event was the night before I asked her out, weeks into us flirting and growing closer. She quickly realised something was up with me and I explained I needed some time alone, and wouldn’t be able to hang out tomorrow. She respected that.

I’m not sure how I feel, what I’m “allowed” to feel given we weren’t exclusive at the time, or what I should do.

They make more money than I do, as they have an established career while I'm still working towards my degree. So far, we've been splitting bills fairly evenly when we go out, without too much issues. We seem to have a good balance between staying in and going out, and when we go out we keep things pretty reasonable cost-wise. However, we keep discussing plans to go on nicer dates in the city and make some other *pricier* trips, and recently my partner offered to pay for more of these outings because they know I make less and they don't like the idea of putting me in a potentially uncomfortable position financially by going dutch on these trips when they can more easily afford to cover us both on these kinds of excursions. 

I really appreciate the gesture, but I really value independence, and I think I would feel incredibly guilty if they spent money on me. I understand in traditional relationships it's somewhat normal for the guy to at least offer to cover the woman's bill on occasion, but I don’t ever want to put someone in a position where they feel responsible for me or burdened by me in any way. My other concern is that we both have struggled with codependency in previous relationships and I worry that an unequal financial relationship could create space for codependent habits to form. On the other hand, I don't want to hold my partner back from having fun simply because my own wallet is running a bit slim.

We've did things a few times before and I didn't want to do anything again but I get kind of sensitive with things (relationship, etc) and I got kind of drunk/high and I asked him to give me a blowjob (which didn't last long, I made it quick) since he offered earlier. 

I didn't have the intention of doing anything until then. I really do regret it and I really am not and do not want to do anything with him or ANY guy again. I feel nasty, dirty and guilty. I love my girlfriend, she loves me, and I am her first (sexually, relationship, etc). I talked a lot about her regarding homosexuality as in not so much of supporting some things, I also talked a lot about being against cheating and always was paranoid or something about her (issues I'm working on).

I went on a first date with this girl I had met online. She was very attractive. Dressed well. Very feminine and she clearly had high interest in me. We went out to dinner and had some drinks. I felt we got along very well and the date seemed to go very smooth and by the way she was talking it seemed like she had every intention of seeing me again. After the date she stayed at my place and we had sex. Due to drinking too much I was a little off my game in the bedroom and I struggled to “keep it up” aswell. So the sex ended up being fairly subpar and underwhelming for her. But she still cuddled up to me afterwards. I can’t lie I began to feel some type of way about this girl on just the first night. And I think she may have sensed this and it might have turned her off or lowered her attraction for me because I may have given off relationship type vibes on a first date. A combination of that and the average sex. I think changed her perception of me entirely. I’ve been fairly sexually active as of late with numerous different women. But this one girl to me was the best quality women I have been on a date with in years. This is why I began to like her so early. The next morning when we woke up I went in for a kiss (stupid I know) and she seemed hesitant. Almost as if she just wasn’t attracted to me anymore. Anyway I drove her home and didn’t contact her for a few days. When I initiated contact her replies seemed a lot slower and she just didn’t seem as interested in me as she did initially. She was still somewhat friendly. But you could tell she had lost some interest. I was very careful to not over pursue this girl and come off needy. I texted her 2 weeks later trying to make plans which didn’t come to fruition and then the following week I tried again. After trying to make a second date twice and hearing things like “I’ll let you know” etc. I figured she just wasn’t interested in me anymore and I stopped texting her completely. I was expecting to never hear from her again. Then 3 weeks of no contact go by and out of no where she initiated contact with me for the first time ever. And she asked  what I was doing for the weekend. She then asked me out on a date. I was very happy thinking me walking away had sparked her interest again. (And maybe it did) but when the date came around she was late. (Although her excuse sounded pretty legit.) after we had a few drinks she started talking on the phone and texting a lot. Almost as if she was testing me. I tried to act unfazed but it kinda pissed me off. The night was pretty fun but I felt she was acting kinda funny. Anyway she didn’t stay over this time because we both had plans the following day. No action this time around aside from  some making out at the end. Since then it’s been 3 weeks. We’ve spoken a handful of times via text. She’s initiated contact once which I felt was positive. But the last conversation we had just a few days ago she stopped responding when the text I had sent prior (even though it wasn’t a question) clearly was a conversation starter that warranted a response. I feel if she was truly interested in me she would have replied. But I’m saying that this girl seems to be full of mixed signals. I know she’s talking to other guys and I think she was even texting other guys on the last date. I’m sure she’s probably got her eye on someone else that she’s more interested in me right now and that’s sucks but she’s not my girlfriend so it is what it is. I’m talking to other girls too. But I’m just really curious as to where I stand with this girl in particular And out of the few girls I’m talking to she’s the one I’m most interested in.

I didn’t think too much of it, until I matched with a guy living in the UK that I really clicked with. We have similar backgrounds: both third culture kids and shared lots of same interests in travel, games, and values. He once asked me what my favorite cafe was and when I told him, he said he happened to know the owner of the cafe! What a small world! Anyhow, I’m very new to this long distance dating thing and generally have never been in a long term relationship before (the longest time I dated someone was probably 4-5 months and it didn’t work out). I’ve been told to take it slow and just be myself but sometimes I wonder what we are: we’re not in a relationship but we both communicated that we connected and vibed. We’ve both opened up a bit about personal family problems and video call from time to time but I am usually the one suggesting, he told me he’s not usually a call kind of person. He told me he plans to visit my country but because of covid it’s been really difficult. My questions are: How do I ease the anxiety of LDR? We’ve only been talking for about a month or so but is it too early to talk about expectations? Should I be talking to other guys as well just to keep my guard up?

I need some advice on how intentional I should be with dating vs just going with the flow. I’m a 28y/o F from the UK. Haven’t been in a relationship for around 3 years nearly, but had dated someone on and off for part of that time, ending last year. For context, that situationship was with a friend of a few years, and we both have our own places. So even though we were label-less and unofficial, it felt like a mature relationship, we travelled together, could work together, cook together etc. I’ve now met a guy (28/M), who’s fun, handsome and we started off as friends, talking for months on end during lockdown. We’ve now started seeing each other, as restrictions eased up, and hit it off in person pretty much instantly. The attraction and chemistry is there, we have fun, going for drinks and dinner and always end up staying together at my place or somewhere he books for us. 
I’ve just spent the weekend with him this past week, that was effectively our 4th date, but lasted for 48 hours. This is the usual set up for most of our dates. We’ve both spoken about taking things slow, but he’s also expressed he’s only exclusively dating me and wouldn’t be thrilled if I were to date others but can’t tell me not to. I’m in two minds about him because although I have so much fun with him, it feels like just that, just fun. I know the type of partner I need in my life and have usually dated older guys, because I need emotional maturity from a partner. I’ve held out/not settled in previous relationships because the guys I’d dated were too immature and had poor communication habits and/or other bad habits. I’m aware I may be reaching for the stars/setting my expectations too high, but from experience, I wind up feeling alone or like I can’t speak to my partner if the communication is just surface level. My personality is very independent, so I won’t force things onto them, but that ends up with me dealing with things individually and feeling alone in the relationship, because the guys I’ve dated don’t know how to handle the situation. I very much take on the ‘care-taker’ type of role. 
Now with this guy, he’s very much that, emotionally immature. He struggles to communicate his feelings or thoughts to me, which makes me feel like sometimes we’re just two friends hanging out, rather than dating. Our chemistry is off the charts in the bedroom, but out and about, I kind of want him to initiate more physically or even call me ‘babe’ to make me feel like I mean something to him. I guess, I need the reassurance. Now I’ve communicated some concerns to him previously, to which he has tried to step up in certain areas with, such as organizing proper dates rather than just coming to mine to Netflix and chill. But even when I’m out with him, I’m bothered! Like yesterday, he was on his phone a lot, texting all his friends, the conversation was ‘basic’ to put it bluntly and I’m the type of person that won’t bother someone if they seem preoccupied, I don’t need to beg for the attention. But I did find it rude that he couldn’t concentrate just on me, or even try to get to know me on a deeper level, which I’d already expressed to him that the emotional connection felt lacking just the week before. When I come away from our long dates, I feel like we’ve spent time together, but I don’t know much else about him from a ‘hard hitting’ questions standpoint. Unless I’m the one asking the questions. He also doesn’t compliment me much; this past weekend was the first time he expressed that he’d missed me. Which took me by surprise as he never says anything like that, it was very cute! 
I find him endearing and sweet, plus so handsome; the attraction is very important and I’m glad we have that. But I don’t want to be with someone who can’t handle ‘real life’ and leaves that all to me in a relationship. Because it seems like that already.
What would you do in my shoes? Continue seeing this guy and slowly begin raising the bar with expectations and effectively telling him what I need?

Every time he would say something about spending our life together I’d just ignore that part of the message and keeps he conversation going. I mention I need time but I never mentioned whether I was actually interested. He got the hint that he was being too forward after we went a whole weekend not speaking.

Now, he’s a lot more chilled and we still talk everyday. He still hints majorly that he wants to be with me and I can say that I’ve started to catch feelings. However, this might just be because of exams, but whenever I flirt with him he says something ridiculous like “sorry I have a wife”. Like he’s scared of rejection or misinterpreting. Last night we phoned for hours and every time I’d dig into him about who he likes he would say we can speak about it when finals are over. Just before we got off the phone, we had a bit of an intense flirting sesh where he asked if I want to be his *insert any female half of a TV couple* and I was like hmm perhaps and I ended the call for effect. An hour later I messaged him saying I’ll b his *other half* and he messaged back “I’m gay sorry” . Why is he being difficult when I actually like him back??

Hey guys!

I've been dating this girl for about a month now (6 dates) and everything's been going smoothly.

We're currently taking things slow since I just got out of a long-term relationship. Last night, I tagged her on sexually-suggestive meme on the Facebook page - Subtle Asian Dating and she has turned cold in her replies. We still text but I can sense that she's mad about it. I really have no intention of getting into her pants and just wanted to tease her since we can't meet at the moment due to the lockdown.

I've just asked her whether she's angry about this and waiting for a reply. What can I reply or do to recover from this?

Thanks!

So my question is how long do you guys still look for other options while already semi seeing someone?

It lasted 5 hours, talked about loads of stuff, had our first kiss, etc. Overall it went great and I'd like to see her again; It was almost all great, BUT... Towards the end we were sitting down talking and I said:

 ""I'd love to be able to give good back rubs."" to which she said something to the effect of:

""Just got this new nice smelling lotion for massages. I LOVE backrubs, I'm in a friends with benefits situation and he gives amazing backrubs""

My stomach sank. It was completely out of left field and I didn't know how to respond. The conversation sort of shuffled onto something else. I suspect because early in the date we were joking about some serious displays of PDA going on around us, which led briefly to a disucssion of kink, she maybe felt the tone was relaxed enough to mention it. Regardless, I'm in a weird situation now.

I only ever sleep with one person at a time, whether that's in a fwb, dating or a relationship. I only feel comfortable if that's their view too. Now I'm going to have to broach this subject if we continue seeing each other.

I really vibed and felt her since we would have very similar interests and our personalities were almost identical since we liked many things and had many things in common. We've been getting along very well. She would apoligize that she was a bad texter so I then asked for her number so we could talk on the phone. 
 
We started out by talking on the phone for hours almost everyday. We haven't really been talking on the phone last week. But when we did we would talk about very personal things and topics and pretty much would ask eachother a lot of different things just so we could get to know eachother. I ended up asking her out on a date. 
 
The first date went very well, I brought her roses, ferrero chocolates and a stuffed bear. She later told me that it was a nice gesture that she was suprised but she liked them. I took her out to eat then went to watch a scary movie and ended up cuddling and after I took her to Dave and busters. I ended up teaching her how to play pool. after that would end up having a few dates after that. Just last weekend I took her downtown to the city and we had a great time. 
 
Then two days after we both went to six flags which was fun but since we were both tired from not sleeping well we both didn't talk as much as normally but we would still talk here and there while waiting in line for the rides. I did notice she would be on her phone quite often while we would wait for the rides. I tried my best to keep a convo but Since we always talked about a lot of things it was hard to start a convo. then after I dropped her home, we talked and we had a nice convo through text. Then the next day comes, I sent her two messages through snap and she leaves me on delivered. Then she responds a few hours later. I would notice that she would be online on social media but would not respond through snapchat. 

So I just been overthinking if she really liked me. She told me she found me very attractive as a person and physically as well. We also made plans to go to lollapalooza together. We both agreed to go to lolla no matter what even if we were seeing other people, we agreed together we could go as friends. (Which that made me overthink a bit as well)

I noticed recently that she made it so I wouldn't be able to see her instagram stories, but since we aren't really dating yet I wouldn't bring it up. But that made me feel like she would be talking to other guys, and would not want me to see certain things she would post on her instagram story.
 
I am going on vacation for about a week starting friday. We made plans to hangout on thursday before I would leave. I was thinking of asking her out when I came back from vacation. I was thinking of taking her somewhere nice to eat around the city. But due to my insecurities and overthinking I was thinking of just asking her out on thursday. 
 
I know she is talking to other people for sure since thats what mostly everyone does from these dating apps. I stopped talking to other girls about a week and a half ago because non of them interested me like how I found her interesting. She seemed like the person I would want to be with since she has very similar goals as I have and similar ideals. It just gave me anxiety when she would lag on responding at times while she would be online on social media and her snap score would go up. I don't really bring that up due to the fact that we aren't really official yet. I would feel like she wouldn't want to be with me yet when we hangout we would always hold hands during our car rides.
 
I'm confused befause we would hold hands and kiss everytime we would hangout. Would I be able to get any advice? Should I just shoot my shot on thursday or wait till I come back from a family vacation? We've been talking for about a month and have gone out to about four dates and this thursday would be our fifth date. I am honestly worried about rejection but Also feel like I should do it due to my anxiety caused by my insecurity.
 
If I do end up shooting my shot I was thinking of getting her roses and two crystal bead bracelets (one that represents love) since she is into the whole crystal thing. I would have one for myself and one for her to match. Would that be okay or would that be a little too much?
