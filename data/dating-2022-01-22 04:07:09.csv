It's not a personal choice, it's lack of opportunity. I haven't had a girl interested in me ever, and meeting anyone is just difficult for me honestly. I don't wanna rush myself but I've been ready for a long time and seeing everyone else in relationships kinda hurts because it's something I feel like I'll never get to experience. 

How tf does all this work? How can I meet people, tell if a girl is remotely interested, etc?

2,s9zwyb,1642848345,I had a succesful date yesterday but I still feel shame from cumming too fast,"This date actualy started really good, I was confident, I was myself, I didn't feel any anxiety despite my autisme and OCD, and I know it's those little victories I should be focusing on, but when we went from talking and into the bedroom and she went down on me it couldn't even have been a minute before I came. Which surprised me because last time I had sex I couldn't cum at all. She said her self she was way more of a giver than a reciver, so she felt good that she made me cum so fast but that we could just try again when I'm ready so I could fuck her. She had told me before that she never cums doing sex but love it anyway so I really wanted her to injoy herself so I went down on her, but in her own words that just made her want to fuck even more. This put so much preasure on me. Ever second that went by was a second she had to wait for round 2 wich was the only thing she really wanted me to give her and I couldn't. After a while I said it would probably be better if we went back in her living room to finish the movie we were watching so I could relax and get ready. But it felt like over an hour had past and I still couldn't. Her mood was still the same as before and to be honest that was the part of our evening I injoyed the most. Just talking and laughing and getting to know each other, not like the first half when we were both just horny. She was really sweet and said it was fine I came so fast and that it made her happy, at that point we both knew there wasn't gonna be a round 2 and I had to go home soon.
Despite all this I still feel bad, and even though last night I heard nothing in her voice that made her sound disapointed in me I'm still thinking to myself that well maybe she is. Life sure ain't like porn with an 8 minute blowjob in the begining.

3,sa08xw,1642849655,How can I stop making guys see me as casual only?,"Okay so a scenario I‚Äôd just like some feedback/perspective and other opinions on: 

About a year ago I (23F) was seeing this guy (28M) I met OLD. We chatted through IG pretty much every day, he suggested coffee as our first date. Second date was dinner, third date was a movie at his ‚Ä¶ and we ended up sleeping together. I thought it was all going really well as we were still talking all the time up until the third date. After this his replies were super inconsistent, and we ended up sorta just not talking any more since I didn‚Äôt want to be chasing him or trying to see what the go was (he obviously wasn‚Äôt interested). Then a few months later he removes/unfollows me on IG and has a girlfriend. Anyways, that brings us to this year where I bump into him and we chat, he adds me back to IG (I assume he is now single). After chatting for another month, he suggests we catch up for coffee  which I agree to and we end up hanging out all day and I sleep with him again (yeah üôÉ). He does the same thing as last time where he starts contacting me less enthusiastically and doesn‚Äôt seem as interested. I decided to make it clear that I like him, but I‚Äôm not sure where we are at and I say that I‚Äôm not interested in just being casual sex and he says he must have misinterpreted the situation, he doesn‚Äôt want anything serious. 

Sorry for the rant guys (just want to give all the details). But this leads me to my question, did I misinterpret the dates as him wanting something more, or did he initially want to date but didn‚Äôt after sleeping with me? I just can‚Äôt get my head around it and can‚Äôt help but feel a little bit irritated.

Either way I think I‚Äôm done with this one, but trying to work out where I went wrong so I don‚Äôt have to go through this again in future üòÇ",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sa08xw/how_can_i_stop_making_guys_see_me_as_casual_only/
4,sa099w,1642849693,This sub wants you to feel bad for everything you can't change about yourself,"I've been observing and lurking some of the posts in here (and other dating subs) and what a cesspool of negativity and sadness.

And someone always links to some arbitrary study or sampling that shows yes indeed these random data has me doomed for the rest of my dating career and life.

Of course, everybody has preferences. These include but are not limited to what I mentioned in the second paragraph. It's just the tone and bitterness that has me perplexed. And honestly sometimes even I feel bad about myself after reading these (I'm a minority in my country and shorter than average).

She rejects you? Could be a million different reasons enough to fill the space between here and Mars that has nothing to do with things you can't control.

She said perhaps she could come to my place. It was a good time I think. She cuddled next to me the whole time and we kissed several times. She was around for about 7 hours. She made a few references to doing it again in the future and she complimented me on my looks. I‚Äôm thinking great‚Ä¶

At the end she said (not me - I didn‚Äôt bring it up at all), we should go on another date and I kissed her again. But I just thought I should be straight up and just asked her later what do u think about me because it‚Äôs easier to be honest over text right.

Then she says I just see us as friends. Which is fine I just said ah that‚Äôs okay no need to worry sort of thing. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get over it but it slightly stings because I wasn‚Äôt expecting it really.

I‚Äôm just gonna go on more dates tbh now but still it makes me sad. I had liked her for a long time rip. Maybe I was too physicalllllll.

10,sa0vr1,1642852206,How do I approach this girl I see every day on the way to the school?,"Hey! For some context: I (17M) fairly recently swapped schools, but didn't go there physically until previous week because of covid. I know I am new there and people give me extra attention for now, like random hugs from girls and lots of compliments and it boosted up my confidence a little from previous break up. I am pretty good looking and just not your normal average guy. (Not trying to say I am better or anything just everyone says that about me). 

Since I am not legal to drive yet I take bus to and from school everyday. I was a bit nervous the first time because I wasn't used to riding a bus with lots of people inside. Around second or third day I noticed this girl was hopping on the same bus at the same time as me. I payed a little attention to her at first because I couldn't see her properly through the crowd of people in the bus. 

On day 4 she got on the bus and stood right in front of me and I could see her for the first time. She was just gorgeous. Long black hair with hints of red, cute face, she dressed really nicely (had leather jacket I couldn't adore) which is huge plus for me personally and I could make up that she listened to Nirvana for sure. I am 6'1 and she is probably around 5'9 - 6' which is another huge plus for me since I like a tall girls. 

One week later goes by and I discovered this girl goes to the same school as I, and was shocked! She just looks so mature compared to the girls I used to like.  Now I have only two problems:

1. She is 19 and I am 17. I personally don't care that she is older, but she might not be alright with the age gap. I can't imagine what she may think when I confront her and she discovers that I am younger. I am really ahead compared to people that are my age. I have only older friends (around 18-19) and  think I could have a lot in common with her and our mental age can be pretty similar. What do you guys think? Have you ever had same or similar problem? 

2. I am INTP and that means I find it really hard to show my emotions and just start conversation with someone. I suffered from lots of stress lately and I am really insecure about myself even with the extra attention from other girls. I am scared that I will say or do something she might not like. 

I know her ig since other classmates already told me but she doesn't know me in person and I don't want to message her on there. Other places I can talk to her is either in bus, school and on the 1 minute long walk to school. I would personally go with the 1 minute walk to school option since that's the most private option from them all and at the same time it wouldn't be so intimidating since we are in public place with lots of people walking around. 

My main question is: How do I approach her? What should I say? What should I ask for number/ig? 


TL;DR: Saw this girls on the bus and was too scared to talk to her, discovered she goes to the same school, she is 2 years older than me, I don't know how to approach her.

So me and my ex started of as friends, he is a part of our friend group. We dated for about 2 years since I was 17. We were each other's firsts almost in everything but we decided to end things because things are becoming way too toxic. Even if things already ended, we still remain as friends. I don't know but it just felt normal to get back to where we were before we started dating. We help each other in our school activities even if we are from different schools. He's very good in math while I excel at language. So we're there for each other, only for academics purposes because we know each other's capabilities. We also have the same course in college which makes it a bit more helpful.

Then, I met my current bf (24M). I met him the same year me and my ex broke up. So fast forward, our feelings are mutual and I told him everything about me, including my ex and my firsts. He was shocked at first but I proceeded to tell him anyway because I don't want to hide anything from him. He kept asking me about my life stories and I thought it was his way of accepting me but I guess I was wrong. After dating for 8 months, we made it official. Things escalated and now he is very weirded out or start questioning the things I do which was stuff I told him from the very beginning before we even made it official. Things such as, me and my ex helping each other in school or me and my ex still remaining as friends after we broke up.

We compromised of course. I asked him to reconsider my friendship with my ex just till we graduate from college. He agreed at first but then he started acting out saying it's totally wrong. He also acts out when I'm hanging out with my friends which obviously includes my ex since he's also a part of our group. So, I'm very confused atm.

I can't help feeling upset because I think it is unfair because I already told him about all of it even before we started liking each other. What should I do?

27,sa3ra7,1642862001,West Elm Caleb advice,"Following the WEC situation, I thought Id give the women here a bit of advice.

When you make the choice to enter the dating world, whether it be irl or through an app, you put yourself at risk of being used for someone elses benefit. 

As much as we‚Äôd like to think that everyone on tinder is there to meet their future spouse, thats just not the case. A lot of men are on there for sex, and a lot of women are on there for attention and free food. Its just part of the game. I know plenty of women that go on multiple dates per weekend and suckle on the wallet of desperate men that are well aware of the risk that they are being used.

I think I can speak for most men when I say that we‚Äôve all been ghosted after paying for expensive dinners and thinking/hoping it was leading to something more serious.

It seems like the women calling out the Calebs of the worlds don‚Äôt realize that they are not immune to these harsh realities either. In the same way that women use their looks and sex appeal to their benefit, some men have learned to use their charisma and charm (what is now being labeled as ‚Äúlove bombing‚Äù) in order to raise the odds of their date developing into a sexual encounter.

Also, considering the fact that none of these people are claiming to have been in a committed relationship, he had no obligation to exclusively go on dates with only one woman.

tl;dr The dating world is harsh. You are not entitled to a persons exclusive attention and you‚Äôre at risk of getting used. Enter at your own risk.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sa3ra7/west_elm_caleb_advice/

It got me thinking, I texted during the uni break saying we should go out for coffee next term, she agreed. Then when she got back, I asked her on a ""date"" and got rejection.

I'm wondering whether specifying ""dates"" is a bad idea. It feels unatural, but it does make your intentions absolutely clear. I can't help thinking it forces others to make a decision on whether they like you now, rather than letting a attraction build naturally; I'd only just met her before the break.

33,sa4ced,1642863802,Navigating dating apps as ENM,"I‚Äôm in multiple open relationships (as are the people I‚Äôm dating) because I enjoy forming intimate relationships with different people at the same time and all the variety that brings. 

All the terms for this: ethical non monogamy (ENM) / polyamory / being open, have, in my opinion, quite negative connotations, which come from societal norms and are generally perpetuated by the media. 

This makes mainstream dating apps tricky. I am on more alternative apps like feeld, but I find these are more geared towards kinks and group sex, whereas I guess I‚Äôm pretty ‚Äòvanilla‚Äô. 

In general, the women on apps like Hinge or Bumble tend to appeal more, but my non-traditional dating/relationship style is clearly putting them off. I have tested this and when I remove the ‚ÄòENM‚Äô from my profile, matches go up more than 10X!
 
I totally understand that most women are on apps like Hinge to find a long-term monogamous partner. But I know there is another group of women who are just looking for casual relationships/friends with benefits/hookups. 

For this second group, I think I‚Äôm the perfect guy! They don‚Äôt need to worry about me getting jealous or me wanting too much of their time; I‚Äôm honest and have learnt to be a good communicator (you kind of have to be to be ENM). 

The question: how best to communicate that I‚Äôm non-monogamous on mainstream dating apps. Is there any way to phrase it that might speak to this second group of women? What are the main reasons women are put off? Any other tips would be greatly appreciated!

I think I‚Äôm at the point now where it‚Äôs just easier being single,but I figured I‚Äôd give this a try first before cutting the cord. I have no single friends so while they can help somewhat, I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs helpful.
About me. 37 yo F. One child whom I‚Äôm with week on, week off. Meaning I have 7 free days to spend time with someone. 
I seem to always attract guys that are solely interested in just fooling around, or distractions. 
We talk, we text, we phone, we meet, all the normal things. We have ‚Äúfun‚Äù a few times, so kinda like dating in all the aspects without the conversation of are we a couple yet. I know I‚Äôm no pornstar expert but I don‚Äôt suck either lol. Then the guy slowly stops talking and texting, I‚Äôll get the one word responses then basically get ghosted ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I‚Äôve tried chasing guys, I‚Äôve tried letting them chase me.
This last guy I met I really liked. We talked on and off over a few months, thanks to Covid and winter we couldn‚Äôt go out to meet in a restaurant. He asked to call me numerous times and we talked for hours. So I invited him to come over to watch movies. No expectations. I made dinner we watched movies, fooled around a bit because it felt right. I like to go with the flowü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. At any rate he stayed over, helped me with some things around the house before leaving. Messages me when he gets home. Everything seems fine. We were doing the whole texting good morning and good night things, texting all day kind of thing so I keep doing that. This time I notice it‚Äôs more me keeping the conversation up. He‚Äôs doing less conversing. So that‚Äôs usually my cue for he‚Äôs going to ghost. I ask him if he‚Äôs wanting to have a phone call instead. He said yes, so we talk. I ask him if he‚Äôs interested in doing something again next week which he says sure we just need to pick a day that‚Äôll work and decide what to do. It was probably an hour conversation at this point. He wants to go to bed so says we can continue this tomorrow. 
Tomorrow comes around and I message him, he responds. I send him another message asking him if he‚Äôd like to do this particular event and nothing. No response. No phone call.
At this point I‚Äôm not messaging anymore cause obviously he‚Äôs either busy or just not interested. 
My question is, why does this keep happening. I make myself very clear on what I‚Äôm looking for and they have a clear idea what I‚Äôm like as a person before we meet. I don‚Äôt change, I look exactly like my pictures. 
After leaving my ex, I had a line up of interested guy friends interested. (I made it clear to them I wanted to just stay friends)

At the start it was fine when I had the blindfold and was handcuffed. But as it went on and he got more rough it started to hurt and I felt claustrophobic which caused me to panicked and forget our safe words.

He didn‚Äôt stop until I started crying. But when he did he immediately took everything off and we stopped to take separate showers. So we ended the night in bed cuddling and he just kept apologizing non-stop.

We school/work we haven‚Äôt been spending much time together, but he‚Äôs been constantly checking in on me to see if I‚Äôm alright. He‚Äôs also been reassuring saying that it wasn‚Äôt my fault for forgetting the safe words and that he should have been more careful.

From everything he‚Äôs been doing I feel like he thinks he seriously hurt me, even though I feel fine now as it was more a panicked in the moment kind of thing.

Come Saturday night I went and drove to pick her up and as she came towards me I actually noticed yeah, she‚Äôs not the same weight that‚Äôs depicted in her photos, she also looks older in person. She still has that gorgeous smile of hers but in that instance I immediately felt off and misled. 

Driving to dinner my head was spinning of disappointment. I shook it off though and tried to make sure I have a good night out. At dinner we were conversing pretty well ordered more drinks it was becoming a pretty good night. She brings up her previous experiences (me personally I hate doing this) but her previous experiences with men seem to be from the photos apparently other men straight up asked how much she weighs, did she photoshop her photos etc etc

That again put me well off completely as she‚Äôs been doing this for some time now!

I drove her home and we end the night. I then looked her up on Facebook and Insta and turns out the photos she used was when she was 21. 

I informed her I didn‚Äôt grow the romantic feelings during the date and she asked ‚Äúwas it because I looked different‚Äù I made sure I was respectful as possible and I said I would have felt differently if she used up to date photos of herself.

60,sa6z4s,1642871300,I [27M] got Ina fight over finances with my gf [26F]. Was I right?,"

Backstory: I do well for myself, but have a few of my own important debts to take care of (loans etc). My gf moved from another country during Covid, and she is pretty reliant on her parents' money or her job (which she does part time). Essentially she is a little hardstrapped for cash.

Amidst all of this, whenever we meet up I always pay for everything and thats fine. Over the past few months the following has happened:

Initially she aske me to cosign her lease (which I declined because I was't in a position to take on more risk). She was pretty dissapointed.

2) She expected me to always pay for her uber back and forth from her place to mine (because I live alone and she lives with a roommate).

3) I pay for every meal, but like 2 times it happened, I either forgot my wallet or my card wasnt working, she expected me to actually interac her the bill she footed

All these things really pissed me off, particularly 2 and 3. I was ok with it only because she is hard pressed for cash.

BUT, then I find out, she actually had about 5K more in her account. This came up in conversation and I got upset because I was like I told you it makes me feel really weird that I have to pay for you to uber back and forth and apparently even like one time when you had to foot the bill for a dinner you expected an interac from me, you already had enough money to support your self. (Mind you she has a job albeit part time at the time and from what I gather she could have easily borrowed from her parents if she had to.)

This led to a huge fight. Some bad things were said. Did I overreact or would this piss you off too?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sa6z4s/i_27m_got_ina_fight_over_finances_with_my_gf_26f/

Next day he publicly tried to find something else to do for a day we had arranged plans. Guess he wanted to find something else to do first and then bail.
I called it off after this because I thought he was playing some kind of game and he kept bailing on plans, but then I thought maybe I'd acted rash.

71,sa82om,1642874286,Being bullied at work for respecting another's relationship?,"I have this recurring problem at work with some of my male coworkers and I wanted to get the Reddit community's take on this.

Some men at work flirt with me and show interest in me, which isn't a bad thing as long as it's not sexual harassment. A lot of people meet their SO at work. I am a single woman, so when I meet a guy I like that seems to like me too, I consider it a good thing.

Here are some of examples of things these guys did that caused me to think they were interested in me:  
\- One used to come to my desk and chat with me everyday. Told me about his life, a lot of his personal problems, etc. He also brought me candy (chocolates, etc.)  
\- Another guy invited me to a bar after work to get a drink with him and watch him play guitar at an open mic night. Also said I was pretty.  
\- Still another used to send me funny memes daily through the company's internal IM service where we worked.

The problem? All of these men had a girlfriend and didn't tell me. They didn't mention her. Not even once. And keep in mind we'd talk about all kinds of things, like what we did over the weekend, etc...and their girlfriend never came up in conversation.

Naturally, once I found out, I made sure not to flirt with them anymore, and not accept their invitations to 'hang out' after work, or any candy gifts they might have for me. I was upset because I got my hopes up and felt let down. I was always hurt when it happened. It made me feel lied to and used, but I kept my emotions and check and maintained a strictly professional relationship with these men out of respect for the relationship. I don't want to treat other women the way I wouldn't want to be treated. I'd be devastated if I had a boyfriend who was emotionally cheating on me at work, so I try not harm other women in this way.

But what was even more confusing was the AFTERMATH. After I learned of their relationship status and adjusted my behavior, these men started to be mean and cold toward me and behave passive aggressively toward me - and sometimes it affected work. One of them stopped responding to my (work-related) emails. Another used to talk to all our coworkers and ignore me and pretend I wasn't there. He'd also shoot me dirty looks or pretend not to hear me if I said hi to him. The third one started to snap at me if I asked him a work-related question. He also started to find fault with me over petty things. Like once, I was on the phone with a client, and he went to my desk to tell me I was being ""loud"". Ironically, he said this loudly because I think he wanted to shame me in front of other people at the office (He had never treated me like that before). 

Other employees noticed their aggression towards me and would ask what happened between me and him and I would answer ""I don't know"". Because that's the truth. I really don't understand why these men get angry with me. They weren't wronged - I was (and their girlfriend was), but when I revert to having a professional and friendly relationship with them upon finding out their relationship status, they react this way. Why is that? What would these men tell themselves to justify treating me like this at work after they lied by omission?

So I met this women a month ago on tinder and we have been talking up until two weeks ago where we started dating. She is amazing and she is been really forward with me about what she wants, what she expects and that I should not worry.

I have a background of running away from intimacy and running away from people when it starts even a little to be serious.

But with this woman I always felt safe, listened, cared for and I was able to open a lot and she was able to do the same.

I have never been in a relationship in my life and I have been living alone, independant all my life.

She has had relationships but it never stable as she says it and I have been giving her everything shes looking from a man so far as she says it. She has had trust issues and some mental wellness issues. I have been doing my best to listen to her and to give her the safety shes looking for because she really interests me in every ways.

When I am with her, I feel amazing, the conversation flows well, we have intimacy and its going okay and I really wanna see her again and have fun again.

The issue is that when I am not with her, I am anxious like I have never been in my life, I have almost completely lost my sex drive , I have diarhea from the anxiety and I have lost hunger.

I have been straightforward with her about almost every issues in my life, shes been understanding and shes been open about most of her issues so far and shes been open to let me know about whats going through her mind and the emotions shes feeling.

I am very very very shy about these things, and I am anxious about intimacy so I told her in the first place and shes been pretty open about intimacy and have given me the go signals for when I am allowed to go forward with hugging, kissing, etc. if I feel like and I am not anxious about it.

Still a new date is coming soon and I am anxious has never, I am stressed about kissing, I am stressed about disapointing, I am stressed about everything when I should not be as everything so far has been perfect. I have told her everything about this too and shes been amazing but my gut is hurting 24/7/

I have no idea what to do, I have done meditation, listened to ASMR, listened to music, etc. and yet I am anxious has never.

81,sa8t6p,1642876307,"Dating apps have been toxic so I (M22) deleted them. It feels great, at least for now. Anyone that has done it, how has it gone for you long term?","Note; wow I didn't realize I would write this much, caffeine is one hell of a drug. This has turned into a vent/advice seeking post so I apologize - but I appreciate you if you stick through the whole thing (or if you just read the TLDR and respond)!

I (M22) deleted dating apps. To preface, I graduated college last year and have found juggling work and hobbies strenuous on my ability time-wise to socialize (obliviously). FYI I live in the same major US city I went to college in, so I'm comfortable with my surroundings. I'm worried that I'm missing out and want to find a partner eventually, but I don't know how it'll happen. Just looking for some insight from anyone that has made that jump. I don't like all that stupid public pick-up artist ""game"" stuff; I am wondering if anyone had a unicorn moment or if there are some habitual changes you recommend to increase chances of meeting a good person. 

**Why I deleted dating apps:**

I  typically got a lot of matches on dating apps. I'm also pretty good at following through if a girl does respond. But that's the thing, a lot of times, they don't. And when they do, and things follow through,  I have yet to have anything more than someone who was getting out of a relationship and needing to fuck. Some things have actually lasted months but most of these women have had some serious mental things like depression going on during the time we meet and it doesn't work out. This was pretty damning to my mental health and caused me to question my self worth which led to me a therapist. Maybe my matches were a symptom of my bad luck but either way I am ok now :) Dating apps were my go to because they were easy and caused me to be comfortable in my introverted side of my ambivert ways. Life is busy like most of you know but I can't return to the superficial algorithm driven apps because it feels so increasingly ingenuine meeting these people.  

**Since deleting them (a few months ago):**

I took some time off of dating to focus on myself, get in shape, comfortable at work, etc. But, I met a girl through a mutual friend at a Halloween party. We hit it off and there was definitely mutual attraction, I asked her on a date. The date was fantastic and she really wanted to see me again but some life stuff got in the way and she realized she wasn't ready which I respected.  The date felt great though, as it was the first time in a very long time that I did so without dating apps. We are cool with each other and I hope that in some time our paths cross again because she had a lot of qualities I look for. Since then though, I've been dry as hay. I continue to hustle and grind at the gym and work, and see my good friends when I can. Even then our collective ability to go out has diminished with our new busy lives that I feel the social sphere shrinking. I send out some texts to some girls I had classes with in college asking to go out for dinner but so far a lot of them have either just gotten out of relationships and aren't looking for anything serious or just want to keep focusing on themselves in grad school work or whatever; all respectable reasons. Like I said, bad luck .

**Advice Seeking:**

I do sometimes feel the drag of not having constant attention/communication with interested women, and I am fighting that urge because it seems unhealthy if I am at that point. These apps were so damn addicting and instantly gratifying. This makes me sound obsessive, but I feel as if it is tied more to loneliness. Anyone that has stayed off of dating apps for an extended period of time, after being on them for a while/basing your dating life on them, how is it going for you? What changes did you have to make to adapt to this weird dating climate that is bent on the convenience/accessibility of dating apps? I feel like its weird to even talk to people at bars/clubs.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** I am good at getting matches on dating apps, but I have had a really bad streak since starting them a few years ago. No one seems to have their shit together on them, and their convenience enables this. I deleted them and have had some OK recent dating success but nothing to write home about. It feels like dating culture is so reliant on them that I feel like an odd-man out for not using them. Anyone that has completely deleted them, how has it been going?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sa8t6p/dating_apps_have_been_toxic_so_i_m22_deleted_them/

84,sa8zbd,1642876785,entire relationship was a lie,"Early last year I (21F) was in my final term of university and had downloaded dating apps to pass the time. Around mid-March I matched with X (23M). We talked on the app and he asked me out on a date. I was busy doing my essays so I told him I would reach out once I am done and we swapped numbers. A month later-end of April I texted him asking if he wanted to go on that date. He agreed. The date went well, we connected instantly and at the end he asked for a kiss. I was ecstatic as that was the first date I had ever been on and I liked him. He seemed gentle and sincere to me in his manner. X told me he was going to take on a job in Europe at the end of October.

I had my dissertation to do so I told him we would meet for a second date in Mid-May. Once I was done he asked me if I was free. I said yes and he said once he was back from cornwall we would meet. The second date was lovely and from mid-may we started dating and meeting up weekly. I had never been in a relationship before as I never found anyone I truly enjoyed spending time with and felt had shared values, until I met X. At the start of July I decided to establish exclusivity. We both agreed that once he left in October we would end our relationship, but I told him I only felt comfortable progressing physically (as I was new to this side of things) and emotionally if we were exclusive. He agreed to this wholeheartedly and had told me before then that I was the only one he had met up with/pursuing from the apps. From then on I believed we were exclusively together and dating.

I adored X. He felt sincere, honest and gentle. I loved the jokes we had, things we shared and conversations and by the time he left had fallen in love with him. We agreed to part ways as friends and for a month after he left we still conversed by text/call but as friends.

However I always felt like there was some distance between us that I could not explain. I felt like a secret sometimes as he never introduced me to friends/family-the one time his family was home I was hidden away. I told him that day that I felt like a secret but he said this was the normal dynamic and that I couldn‚Äôt be a secret as they were just upstairs. When we agreed to exclusivity he told me he had an ex of 4 years from university who he broke up with last year (in actuality it was 6 months prior) and that they still texted. I assumed this was just happy birthday texts which I didn‚Äôt mind. In September I saw his ex‚Äôs name on a calendar and asked him about it. He said they meet every 1-2 months for a coffee. I told him I was hurt he lied and that he has to tell me whenever he sees her, but that I don‚Äôt mind them meeting as I trusted his character. He agreed to this.

I took things slow on the physical front. For a while I told him I didn‚Äôt want to sleep with him as I felt him leaving made it too intense of a thing to do (and frankly I personally didn‚Äôt feel secure with him yet). I told him if he didn‚Äôt like this he could happily leave and I wouldn‚Äôt be upset as I understand sex is important to any relationship. He said he was fine with this and just loved spending time with me. A few weeks after I felt more secure as we spent more time together intimately. I told him and I felt secure and trusted him to be my first time. I thought it was a really special moment and felt glad it was with him. The next day he went to Scotland for two weeks, he said he went with his male friend . Once he came back we continued our physical relationship.

Throughout the relationship I always felt insecure about his ex (23F), but assumed it was because I was new to relationships. A month after he left by complete chance a friend of mine came across a photo of X posted by his ex from the two week holiday he said he had done with a male friend. I was shocked. I called X who lied and said he only met her for one day. I called him the next day and said I had more evidence but he still lied and said it was for two days. He never apologised for lying. I told him I was done because he had lied too much. Two days of silence later I sent him an email saying how hurt I was that someone I loved so purely had lied to me and that the evidence still didn‚Äôt match with his statements. I demanded an apology and he gave me one and said he will call me the next day.

It turns out: X had broken up with his ex (Y) in October 2020. In March X met Y to talk over their relationship. Y wanted to be friends and X agreed. During March X made a move and told Y he loved her and wanted her back. At the end of March he asked me on a date. From March-October X was publicly dating Y, who re-met his family/friends and Y believed they were exclusively together again. They went to Cornwall together and Scotland and were in an emotional and physical relationship. Throughout this entire time X had privately been dating me too. He made us both believe we were his girlfriends and lived a double-life. He did this for 6 months in totality. We both loved him and held a torch for him once he left.

Both myself and Y have now completely cut contact with him.

I am heartbroken. I feel incredibly dirty to be kept a secret, and feel confused because he was my first love and I adored him so much. To me he felt like both my love but also a friend who brought me so much happiness. I loved spending time with him. I find it so difficult to separate the person I thought X was (sincere, loving, honest) to the reality of who he is. I feel incredibly violated that my first time was such a lie, the security was never there and that he just agreed to exclusivity to progress things with me. I feel so used and even though he told me he had fallen for me I fail to believe he ever cared about me at all-which feels heartbreaking to come to terms with. I am so scared to date again and wish things were how they once were-though that was always a complete lie. It is also difficult knowing I never had a day where he wasn‚Äôt cheating on me-my entire relationship was fabricated.

89,sa9hx2,1642878200,How To Attract By The Right Man You Desire To Be With In Your Life | Tips For Girls,"Be care careful don‚Äôt ever try to be with someone just because you don‚Äôt want to be single or to also boast in front of your friends. It‚Äôs better to be alone and be happy than be with someone that will make you unhappy throughout your life.

**Be affectionate**

Being capable to give love, affection, and care, to yourself and to others, make people happy it will make them miss your presence with them and more to the point men need women like that to be with. It is important to be affectionate because this is your nature as a woman anyway, you just need to let it out and you will really see results. It‚Äôs one of the important factors in what makes a good relationship.

**Men are different**

Men and women are different. This is humanity. You have to understand yourself first and start to take action, for men, not all sexual relationships are romantic. Most women are more emotional and you need to be sensitive to yourself and if you feel uncomfortable don‚Äôt get into a sexual relationship without feeling some emotional connection first because it won‚Äôt work. If you are not so emotional, then feel free to go in your own rhythm. But it is important to understand that men are different that‚Äôs all I will tell you.

**Know What You Are Looking For**

Try to find someone with a similar culture as yours, with common values, common goals, that he wants the same things as you and is ready to be with you don‚Äôt force yourself into a relationship just to impress the world and cry tomorrow, examine yourself and Imagine your life in the future- what kind of life you can see? And ask yourself this question, Is this person a good partner, loving and caring for you? If yes you are good to go with such a person and if no‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. 

**Be open**

You can never know where and how you gonna meet your man. You have to try new options like matchmaker services, blind dates, and Internet dating. There are a lot of good dating ideas online and you can find many couples that started their relationship as an Online relationship.

**Patient**

It may take some time until you find the answer to how to attract the right man into your life, but you can discover many things about yourself in the way: what you like and what you don‚Äôt, what you want and what you don‚Äôt want. You might also find a few friends along the way.

90,sa9kjm,1642878402,Asked her out and got rejected,"So this girl I‚Äôve known for about a year, we work together and have become very good friends, I always thought she was cute but never liked her enough to ask her out but 2 months ago I started having feelings for her and she was giving me mixed signals, I still didn‚Äôt want to ask her out but the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù was killing me so I said fuck it and I finally did it.

She politely rejected me, gave me the ‚ÄúI see you as a friend‚Äù speech whatever 


The thing is, I was crushed for a few hours but now I‚Äôm am so relieved, my mind feels refreshed (used to think about her a lot) and my focus is back to me and becoming a better person, I‚Äôm not sure why I posted this, just wanted to get it out.


I am just glad I did it, I was terrified of asking her because she is an amazing girl and I wanted ti keep her around, but keeping my feelings ti myself would have been worse than losing her, we are still friends, still in the awkward phase but it will get better!

91,sa9mes,1642878553,How to talk to your girlfriend when you have an issue with them talking to guys.,"So as the title goes this is mainly for guys but this can also help girls get a better understanding as to why we have an issue with it at times.

First of all it's a difficult conversation to have with your girlfriend because you don't want to come off as ""controlling"" to her. The best way to go about it is by simply asking her how many guy friends she has and how often they talk. Don't bring this up in a random conversation, instead after she mentions one of their guy friends bring it up after so it isn't out of the blue. Talk about why it is uncomfortable for us, depending on how many they talk to or how often they talk to them. You can mention that you trust her but don't trust her guy friends.
As a guy I don't trust any guys I don't know so why would I trust her guy friends?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sa9mes/how_to_talk_to_your_girlfriend_when_you_have_an/

Long story short i have caught feelings and he‚Äôs not looking for a relationship. I can feel myself being more invested and things shifting. I guess he was in one that ended last summer. We talked and he told me that he‚Äôs not monogamous and he may not ever want to be and i told him i didn‚Äôt care about that which is something that i have always wanted in a relationship, so i‚Äôm confused. He said we have different views on things and we‚Äôre two different people but idk how that‚Äôs a bad thing. I know that he likes hanging out with me.

Hey!! I hope at least some of you will respond to this post and try and help me out, cause honestly, I am baffled! Alright so, a little about me, I am a Computer Science grad student from NYC. I am not bad looking, I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm some runway model either, I‚Äôm alright. I have a good personality, I have never felt awkward or weird in talking to, being friends with, or even dating/hooking up with the opposite sex. But since I have been in the USA, I have no idea what‚Äôs going on. So initially on Bumble, for whatever reason, I would just not get any matches. Eventually after a day or two, I‚Äôd get bored of the app and stop swiping and eventually delete it. Since I am on vacation, I decided to give it another go. 6 matches on my first day back. 12 matches in like 4-5 days. Most of these matches were from verified accounts as well. Guess what, ZERO texts from the ladies!! I have no idea what‚Äôs going on!! Also, my matches are never with someone I have swiped right on, they‚Äôre always with women who swipe right on me first. Can someone help? What‚Äôs going on lol. My bio is just me describing what I do academically and the stuff I enjoy doing in my downtime, nothing flashy or fancy.
