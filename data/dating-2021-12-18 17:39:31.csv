2,rjjw9e,1639871620,I took my ex back,"I posted here when he broke up with me. I was in a really bad place mentally so the breakup affected me much worse than it normally would. He saw I wasn’t well so he sent me a few messages to check up on me and wanted to hold a conversation with me. I only responded that I’m fine and that’s it. Only a few hours after the breakup he called me to say he made a huge mistake and if we could just forget it. 

We talked it out. He stopped doing all the things that were a trigger for me. He claimed that he loved me even while we were breaking up so he told me that again. He even said that those couple hours without me were horrible and he actually realised how empty he was without me. Started to compliment me again and tell me how he can’t wait to see me. That perfect bf behaviour lasted for about 3-4 weeks and then he started to pull away again. Lame and boring conversations, not texting good night, staying out with me for only two hours despite the fact that we go out only once a week. Something changed again and I went from the happiest to the most insecure and loneliest person again. He’s so unpredictable since he changed in a day and I don’t have strenght for this anymore but it’s so hard to let go. I really want to hate him or be mad at him but I’m just hurt that he doesn’t care the same way as I do or as he claimed he does. The worst thing is that he realises how much I support him and even told me how much he loves that he can tell me anything and yet treats me like this.

5,rjk7ju,1639872625,In a talking stage with this guy from Tinder but the anxiety and overthinking I feel because of him… reminds me so much of my last relationship,"So there’s this guy I met from Tinder and we’ve been talking for a month or so. 

At first, wow. He’s so smooth. So attentive. He initiated adding me up on socials outside Tinder. Constant communication and everything. We’re from the same city but he’s currently working out of town so he said we’re gonna meet up anytime this month when he gets home. After a few weeks, I felt like he isn’t that interested anymore. idk, us girls would know or feel if someone’s really interested, right? He’d ask tons of questions just to get to know you.. and he never did. It’s almost always small talks and lil updates. No honest or deep talks about ourselves so we could get to know each other better.

And I noticed something weird, he suddenly disappears and doesn’t contact me usually during weekends or holidays. He doesn’t reply for a few hours and there were even times he’d reply after 2-3 days. His reason would be work blah blah, ofc since we’re not in a relationship, I just didn’t mind. But this time, it’s bothering me. I know the guy is giving me mixed signals and I’m afraid I’m getting attached while he’s out there, probably enjoying with someone else haha. Most of the time he’s sweet but I just have a bad feeling that he’s just not interested, or like he’s just waiting for us to stop talking because he doesn’t want to do the ghosting.

As I’m typing this, I haven’t heard from him since 7pm yesterday. He said he’s attending a Christmas party with friends but honestly I’m just disappointed and I felt played. Maybe bc I got cheated on in my previous relationship and have terrible trauma so the feeling of overthinking and anxiety felt like flashbacks

How would you tell him if you were in my shows? What would you say? Or should I just ghost him? lol",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjk7ju/in_a_talking_stage_with_this_guy_from_tinder_but/

7,rjkaw2,1639872922,How do people meet these days?! London dating is the worst.,"So I’m not really sure if this is advice or just me having a rant.. but here goes. 

I’m 27F never had a serious relationship. I’ve had a few situationships, but quite frankly I’ve never really gotten involved in dating as with every case I’ve always been someone’s plan B. (I.e I get breadcrumbed away, only to see they’ve become official with another girl a few weeks later), so I’ve just enjoyed living my own life happily and been very content with that. 

However, I’m now wondering if I’m just one big walking red flag? 
I find dating apps quite demoralising, there’s plenty of nice people on them, but no one that I’ve ever found like a spark with. 
I did have one person ask me “what is wrong with you?” When I told then I had been single my whole life, which just made me feel a bit like now I’m a weirdo 😔
I’ve joined plenty of clubs to pursue hobbies the last year or so, but only females ever seem to turn up to them.
My profession is female dominated and I don’t really have as many male friends anymore since graduating. 
I don’t tend to go to bars that regularly as I rarely drink, which by British standards is probably quite bizarre. 

I’m not really sure what the solution is, or what I’m after but now that people are fretting about another Covid lockdown looming I can’t help but feel really lonely and like I would like to meet someone.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjkaw2/how_do_people_meet_these_days_london_dating_is/

Currently 30 years old and have been single my entire life, no girlfriends and hardly any dates. What sucks is that I’m in the best shape of my life, workout daily, have a nice job, my own place, have a butt load of hobbies like hiking, photography, yoga, rock climbing, cooking, love animals etc etc and can’t for the life of me attract a decent woman. I flirt, I make eye contact, smile and overall a very upbeat positive person.

I’m starved of affection, sex and someone to cuddle and love, I just want to know what it’s like; what it’s like to be loved and to give love. To go out on dates and laugh together. What it’s like to bicker over silly things and enjoy each other’s company. I don’t think I should feel bad or guilty for wanting normal human connection that most crave; not to mention the toll I takes on your mental health being alone and rejected for most of your life. 

Everyone else makes it seem so easy to find a partner or sex, but I never even get dates. I ask them out at the gym, out at local meetups, Facebook groups…rejected rejected rejected. Even just this week I asked out my crush I met at an in-person event and she said no. They always say you miss all the shots you don’t take, but what happens when you miss 100% of the shots you DO take? In all my life I don’t think I’ve ever had a woman accept a date from me in person. My few dates I get have always been from apps. 

And no…dating apps don’t really work for me. I’m 5’7 and a person of color, the two worst combos for dating apps. Despite that though, I’m still a pretty handsome, good looking guy and try to stay confident and love myself. 

What sucks is that my average looking friend who’s white and tall came over the other night and showed me his Tinder, he was drowning in matches and likes. Half the women he didn’t even message back because he said, “I can’t keep up with them, they all want to fuck.” All I said back was must be nice.  His bio was empty and only listed his height; Is that really all it takes to get matches is be white and tall? He’s also around my age so it’s not like he’s attracting immature young girls either. 

For the last 5 years I’ve done everything in my power to better myself emotionally, physically and financially…basically in every way possible to become a desirable and valuable man, not just for women but for myself too. You’d think I’d be able to find at least one woman to date with a mutual interest but alas I cannot. I won’t lie, every once in a while I get interest but usually it’s from a woman I’d have absolutely no interest in, usually very overweight; I also receive a lot of attention from gay men. I want to be able to attract a woman from the kind of energy I put out; I live a very active lifestyle and by no means do I expect a future partner to keep up with it, but I should at least be able attract someone who’s in somewhat decent shape. 

I get maybe 1-3 dates a year from the apps and that seems abysmally low for a guy like myself. Some of my platonic female friends have said I’m a and a I quote, “catch”, but clearly I’m not if I never get dates. Maybe it’s because they actually took the time to get to know me and can see something you can’t see on the apps? 

I don’t want to come off as arrogant, but I honestly truly believe I’m the ideal man a lot of women are looking for. I cook, I clean, I love getting outside my comfort zone and trying new things, I don’t mind nights in or nights out, I love movies and shows, very hygienic and wear good cologne, fitted clothes, sociable, great sense of humor and know how to have funny or intelligent conversations and I’m well-spoken. I work my ass off and output 100% effort into everything I do….I’m someone you could be proud to introduce to your friends or family.

I’m just tired of putting myself out there and seeing no results. I’m not desperate and not just looking to date the first woman who looks at me, I just find it hard to believe that I’m not a desirable enough of a man to get dates and get to know someone.

What advice is there for me? I’m not a quitter and not just gonna give up on meeting my special person, but I honestly don’t think I’m doing anything wrong.

I’m sharing it here as a way of coping and it even migh help someone to see what things shouldn’t be overlooked. 

- he always has money to party with his guy friends but never has money to go on a trip with me
- he doesn’t want to do anything I suggest and never makes this type of plans with me (going to the movies, to the mountains, a romantic getaway, basically anything that isn’t hanging out in a coffee shop or in a parking lot).
- whenever he mentions an upcoming trip with boys, he follows up with: I’d take you with me as well but you know it’s only boys, we can go next time (and then we don’t go)
- we see each other once a week and stay out for 1-2 hours
- changing his behaviour and actually treating me the way I want to be treated lasts for like 2 weeks
- his sexualized humor makes me uncomfortable, he even joked about my mom in that way
- “jokingly” called me stupid a few times and even after I told him to stop
- his friend had to tell him he should invite me to hang out with them sometimes since there are also girls in their friend group
- NARCISSISTIC
- I sent him a study that said how men spent xx minutes of their day looking at different women, just so we can mock it and he agreed with it. After I told him it was lame, he responded: „What do you want from me, the study showed it’s true”
- I generally don’t feel secure in a relationship, I have to hide how I feel so I don’t come off too needy or too emotional.

16,rjkqw1,1639874463,Feeling demoralized about relationships,"I'm a 30 year old male who recently got out of a 1.5 year relationship. I know that's not considered a long period of time, but I really loved her. It's been 9 months now, and I've barely recovered. It was a mutual breakup. She's had two relationships since the breakup and many dates. I asked her a few months ago if she had any feelings for me and she said no. It's clear to me that she meant a lot more to me than I did to her. She's had a lot of relationships but she was my first ""real"" girlfriend.

I've just got a very nihilistic state of mind when it comes to relationships. I don't want to think this way, but I can't help it. The average length of a relationship is 2-5 years. The average marriage length is 8 years. The chances of a spouse cheating (contrary to what I would have thought) actually INCREASES with age... Relationships seem so transient. It's also demoralizing knowing that there are hundreds of thousands of people who could replace you.

It's just been a very painful experience overall.. When I imagine her having sex with other men I feel physically ill.. Not to be too dramatic, but I don't know how much more I could take. I'm scared to get emotionally attached to another woman just to end up how I am now.

26,rjlkec,1639877206,"She ended it after two dates, I was surprised to say the least. What should I do now?","Hey everyone, I barely know where to begin, but here it goes.

This is one of those posts regarding rejection. From all the signals I could interpret during the dates we were on, and also while texting, it came out of nowhere and as quite a surprise. So I need your advice on how to handle this going forward.

Backstory, I'm not the most actively dating guy, I'm 27 y/o and when I turned 22 I just got out of a six year long relationship with a girl. The relationship wasn't good I might add, should've ended a lot sooner than it did. It took a huge toll on me and for a while I just wanted to be alone. But ever since I somewhat got over her, I've been curious about dating again, not necessarily eager to, but curious. I've been a Tinder user for about four years now, but I was yet to go on a single Tinder date until I asked the girl out that made me feel the need to write this, lets call her Kim. I'm the kind of guy who wishes to meet a girl irl, and ask her out and let the rest be history. The old school kind of way. Since I'm rather shy I've only been on a handfull of dates since the breakup with my ex five years ago. The ones I've been on have been both great and pure disasters, but none of them lasted, I was mostly the one to get rejected which was fine, every time. I'm usually not the first to give up on things, and I think dating works the same for me, if there's a chance (of feelings or such) I usually like to keep trying. I've never felt the way I do right now after getting rejected after just a few dates, and that kind of scares me.

So, what happened? As I mentioned I've never asked a girl on Tinder out before. It's been more of a ""feel good about myself"" app. I've been chatting with a few girls for a bit, but never done anything other than that. So what changed? About a month ago I wrote a message to a girl that really caught my eyes. She had the looks, the interests that I value and so on. So in the first message I made a reference to one of the pictures she had, and we instantly started a great conversation that night. We spoke briefly about the common interest that I had commented on, leaving a lot for a potential future date. She took over and asked follow up questions about my interests and said she enjoyed the same and I thought, ""Wow, this is going great. She's great"". And I told her so. I said, ""I've gotta tell you, you seem great. I'd like to challenge you to a game of darts so you can show me said skills."" And the first date kinda planned itself out. I asked about meeting on friday almost a week ahead of time and she said yes.

We decided to go for a drink before going to the darts bar. The drink ended up lasting two hours and we had a great time just talking. While playing it got kind of flirtatious and we had so much fun. We were continuously talking and just enjoying ourselves. When we were done, I was fully ready to call it a night, since I've learned from past mistakes that too long of a first date might not be great. But then she was like, ""So, where do you wanna go now? Up for more drinks?"". And I happily said yes, this was going so well.

At the next place we got seated by the bar, so we sat next to each other. And we had a few great conversations. All ranging from discussing hobbies to deeper things. She told me about her dating past and somewhat of what she was looking for, and I told her about mine, followed by a bit of silence, I guess we were both a bit shy at that point. But we both said that it's alright, nothing previous matters, and continued talking. We both felt the same way which was nice. We hung out for seven hours straight, and it felt like barely two hours had gone by. I live just outside the city so I have to take a bus to get home, and when it was getting late, none of us had kept track of time, so she asked me, ""when does your last bus leave?"". And I realised it was in 15 mins, so we left the bar. I paid the tab and while i was paying she offered to pay me back right away, and when I said that it was fine she insisted on paying for the next date. Happy and a little surprised I asked, ""So there's a second date?"". To which she replied, ""yes ofcourse, we're playing tennis next time. It's time for me to kick your ass."" I happily said yes, and we went walking towards my bus. We went our seperate ways and parted with a hug, which seemed appropriate. On my way home which is roughly 40 mins, I kept thinking about how great the night had been, and I was contemplating about whether I should write *tonight* to thank her for the evening and make sure she got home safe or wait til *tomorrow* and ask about more details on the second date or wait for a bit. Keep in mind that we had been chatting every day for almost a week at this point, so texting every day seemed normal. Once I got of the bus my phone buzzed, she had sent a message. ""Thank you for a lovely evening, i had a great time. Hope you got home safe."" I was once again happy and a bit surprised, but I was happy to answer and we ended up texting for another hour, and flirted some more.

We sent a few texts back and forth during the upcoming days, and set a date for the second date, friday a week from the first date. We kept texting about things that happened during the days, it felt kind of light and fun and nothing too serious. From conversations we found a few more things that we would like to do together in the future, which felt great. We both expressed a longing for the date to come and she seemed as excited as I was.

Let's jump to the second date, the second friday in a row. We met up and went to a restaurant for dinner. We had a great time chatting and went on to the activities we had planned out for the evening. We got along better than I could've ever hoped for. There was a bit of a waiting time to be allowed into the tennis court so we sat down and talked for a while, we even missed our name in the queue so we had to reapply and wait some more. Which was fine, since we had a great time talking. While playing we flirted some more and joked around, laughed alot and it really felt special. When we were done we ended up playing some more games that allowed us to be closer to each other, we flirted, smiled and had fun. Then the place closed and we went for a drink. Once that place closed she asked me when my last bus was. And I said in about 10 min. We started walking, got a little lost in great conversations about everything and what we wanted to do the next time we met and things we were looking forward to doing together. And I ended up being too late for the bus. Luckily there's a bus that takes a bit longer, that leaves a lot later, so she said she'd wait with me, atleast for a bit. We went to a bar and sat down, once again next to each other. We basically just sat down, gave each other a few compliments and then we shared a few lovely kisses. Followed by some shy, not really awkward silence. We broke the silence and started talking again. She told me she was looking forward to seeing the things I had talked about soon, and we both said ""yeah, lets do that soon"". Followed by a few more compliments between us. We went to the bus stop and parted ways with a kiss. Once again we texted as soon as she got home. I ensured her I was ok and on my bus home and thanked her for a lovely evening. She replied, ""I had *the best* time tonight"". And we texted a bit, some more flirting but mainly thanking each other for a great time.

Later the next day I sent her a text asking her about some details for the date we had planned for monday, and she answered with a kind of short message, ""I'm not sure, lets talk more tomorrow"". I got a bad feeling from the shortness of the message, and opted for a simple answer, ""Sounds great. We'll talk more tomorrow"". And the next day I waited until after work to text her as we had done for as long as we had been texting. And before I got home I recieved a text. The text explained that she had a great time with me and that she thought I was great, but she didn't feel the right feelings to continue dating. That she had thought things through and that it was a hard thing to tell me, but she felt it had to be done.

I was really surprised and sad, but appreciated the honesty and all that. I told her so and I asked if anything was wrong, since I felt the complete opposite and especially after how things went two days earlier. And she said she understood that it came as a surprise, referring to the date too and that she realised that it came as a surprise, especially with the last date in mind, but she had no other explanation than that it was just a lack of feeling the right feelings for me. I replied with a ""thank you for your honesty, I appreciate it even if it's tough to hear. Let me know if you want to crown a champion after ending things with a draw"". Refering to the fact that we're both competetive people and we had a draw in terms of matches between us.  

Its now been two weeks, and I'm usually not this bad at handling rejection after *""just""* two dates. But the fact is that we've been texting almost every day for almost a month, and we hung out for about 16 hours over two dates, and I really enjoyed every minute of it. And I miss even just the texting now that it's quiet. I haven't been as happy as I was when we were talking in years tbh. I guess the good thing now is that i know how much I want to find someone, and that it's the next goal in life for me.

But the problem is. I have a hard time accepting that after the two great dates we had, she doesn't feel the right things. I know I do, and I'd like to think I got a good read of people at this point. Like, the dates we had definitely were something to atleast build on. I couldn't have been this off. It's not possible. The dates we were on were by far the best dates I've ever been on. The last girl I dated before this, that was even close to having this feeling around it, were ended by the girl after just two dates. She said the same thing about not feeling the right things. Then half a year later she got back to me, saying she was sorry she had lied to me. She said that it had nothing to do with feelings, on the contrary she was scared of how much she liked me, and scared that the fact that I'm allergic to cats, dogs and other pets might be an issue in the future staying with friends and family who have pets, and how that would affect the future together. I guess that stuck with me pretty hard since Kim loves cats. I told her about my allergies on the first date and asked if that would be a problem given that she had the ""catlover"" interest pinned on Tinder, and with a sad look she said, no, it's not like you don't like animals. And smiled. But I guess it's been stuck with me ever since the last girl I dated basically ended things because of allergies.

I have a hard time letting go of this one, and I'm not sure why. And I have a feeling that I just don't want to give up on. Do you have any advice? Do I let her go completely or is it ok to try to stay in touch with her even though she didn't offer friendship while ending it? Might be torture for me, and on the other hand she might not even want to, which I would respect, ofcourse. But I actually care about her alot, and I just wanna know how she's doing.

All my friends said things would work with the last girl. On further inspection, no it didn’t. She obviously is just too nice not to ghost me.

Speaking of being ghosted, I saw one of the girls who ghosted me tonight and it didn’t help. We were calling every night and then all of a sudden she stopped texting or anything. She even got me to text her friend… who also never replied. She said she ghosted a lot of people because she wasn’t in the right head space, but I’m still disappointed. She even waved at me today, I waved back but felt weird about it. Even weirder is how she still talks about me like we still fucking talk.

28,rjlqox,1639877800,Should i apologise dear Redditors ?,"So about 2 years ago i've met a girl trough chat. We've talked and planned to meet but usually she was super busy always so we've never met. Fast forward to 6 months later we got into a fight through facebook messenger (well cause that was the only source of communication between us throughout the whole thing between us) Since then we haven't talked about it

Back then i was super jealous and i couldn't give her the space she wanted. She also wasn't the innocent one but for the most part i was the one who fu&amp;*ed the most. So few days ago an idea popped up in my head to hopefully reach out to her and apologise for my childish behavior. And no, i don't want to revive that friendship/dating between me and her and very most likely she doesn't want that to hapoen either  but i just want to apologise for my mistakes. I will probably do it very soon anyways but i just want to know your opinion on this one. Like isn't it weird to just randomly reach out to someone that you probably don't even remember that much

And why do i wany to do this ? I have no clue. I probably want to make a peaceful end with my past, i want to forget it and move on and live today with yesterday's experience",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjlqox/should_i_apologise_dear_redditors/

42,rjmyle,1639881835,I just got the open ended dump,"I (f23) met this guy (m23) on Hinge back in September and we were both too busy to start dating that we didn’t have our first date until October. There was a lot of chemistry, and cuddling on our movie date and we started making out at the end of it etc. I graduated and am working as a freelancer, and my part time job is over Zoom so naturally I have more free time than he does as he’s getting his Masters part time and working a full time job. Although he had a lot going on, he always showed effort and wanted to spend time with me. I’m not sure but have a feeling we were both virgins that lost it to each other, towards the end of October and he would come over to have some fun and cuddle for a while before he had to go back home. I feel like his family also interfered with whatever our relationship even was, because he had to run around and do things for them or cut out evening short because his mom wants him to go grocery shopping etc. Honestly I was surprised we even saw each other as much as we did given how hectic his life is. I would check up on him and ask how he’s doing etc and show empathy for his busy life.

I was on a film gig these last three weeks and I saw him the first weekend of December, and tried to get him to go to a bar with me and my friends, of course he was busy and told me to have fun for the both of us. I know winter break was starting soon and was looking forward to spending some more time with him.

Today in the middle of December, I had a funny feeling that he was going to end things with me this morning. Because although he always has moments where he can’t really talk, and I just let him do what he has to do while I do me… my intuition was screaming at me that this wouldn’t last long. 

I texted him this morning with a simple Hey what’s up. The whole day goes by and I get a text from him at like 8pm saying:
—
Hey sorry been dealing with a lot of stuff and kinda wanna be alone right now. It’s nothing against you but I just need some time for myself to get through some some stuff. We probably won’t be seeing each other for a while and hope you can understand me 

—
I just kept is short and said:
—
Oh I’m sorry about that I understand 
—
I never fully knew how I felt about him, like if we were just like FWB or an unlabeled couple etc. I kept our relationship private because I didn’t want outside things to ruing something so nice. 

I’m confused because his text implies that he wants to see me again but can’t rn, but we would always go a couple weeks at a time without seeing each other, after having sex we started seeing each other more consistently though. He was a sweet guy and it sucks that it has to end this way. But did it actually end?? Is he just trying to soften the blow with the “for a while” comment knowing he doesn’t really want to see me anymore?

i had my first kiss freshman year of college (lol) and basically it went bad because the guy just wanted to hookup. im already super reserved around guys but i think that incident made me put my walls up even more because i don’t wanna go through that hurt again. i haven’t done anything with a guy since but the older ive gotten the more i think there’s something wrong with me. i wish i wasn’t so reserved with guys but it’s really just the way i am. i don’t think ill ever find a guy who will be patient enough for me to get comfortable. i think im just scared of getting close to guys because i don’t wanna get hurt. im someone who loves deeply and i just know a breakup would completely ruin me. 

i understand and well aware that a lot of not being able to find a bf is my fault. im always too shy to start the conversation or anything like that. im honestly trying to get better at it but at this point i don’t even have anyone interested in me. im also not a fan of dating apps and hope to meet someone organically like through mutual friends. 

sorry if this is all over the place, just been really thinking if there’s something wrong with me and it’s really been messing with my head.

63,rjopop,1639887737,"(M, the late 20s) do you think renting a studio/1bedroom apartment and ditching my roommates will increase my dating prospect?","So I recently graduated from school and managed to get a job. My plan is to wait it out for 6 months and save up a little bit and then decide if I want to ditch my roommates and get a place all to myself or stay with my roommates to save up more. Honestly, even though I think living alone is better than dealing with roommates, I don't mind them as it will help me to save money. I am just out of school and as poor as it gets as I don't have family support (zero debt though, thankfully). getting an independent place will eat up to 25% of my post-tax income while having a roommate (my current setup) will reduce it to 12.5%. My previous dates (when I was a graduate student) didn't mind that I lived on campus and with roommates, but now that I am out of school I think it might be different. 

So my question is that, do you think women, in general, would write off a person based on the fact that they live with roommates and don't have their own place? On the opposite side, do you think having an independent place all to myself will make me look more attractive in the dating market (e.g. makes me look like I have my shit together)? Honestly, I don't mind if a person is living with a roommate as long as it doesn't stem from a lack of ambition for improving their life and increasing their income, but I am a guy and I know expectations from men and women are vastly different in the dating scene.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjopop/m_the_late_20s_do_you_think_renting_a/

I get she is a little sick and I may be over thinking this (I often do about a lot of things) but I already sent two text to her since her last text and don’t want to triple text. I am hoping given enough time she’ll text me back but I’m paranoid because I caught feelings for a really cool and compatible girl. Am I being too paranoid? How long should I wait until I send another text to see how she is? I don’t feel comfortable just randomly calling her as that would come off as crappy to me. I normally wouldn’t get so hung up about this but it’s because we had already been talking for 3 weeks had 3 different “FaceTime dates” as she called it and talked to each other as if we were going to be a couple that I am paranoid.

Today before the movie, he said good morning and I replied with a wave emoji. He normally would continue the conversation via Instagram but doesn’t message again until he said he was waiting at the theater. I was not as bubbly as I was on Wednesday, I was very quiet (not against him). He was annoying me during the movie, he’s the type to laugh and make noises when something exciting came on. He nudged me during the movie and asked if I was ok because I was quiet and I said yes. At the end I told him thanks, he said you’re welcome and he said drive safe. On Wednesday, we ended with a hug.

So my ex and i were talking again after 6 months of no contact. I dm’d him on Instagram first. He was really rude in the beginning but somehow we got back together. Yesterday he texted me politely saying he wanted us to work but it’s ‘different’ for him now, and that he wouldn’t be able to love me the same anymore and he apologised for being rude too and he said we should go on our own way. He thanked me for trying again. He texted that we can still see each other and we should grab lunch together but he deleted that message again. We spoke about two times on phone, he said that it was really hard to talk to me. 
I told him I respect his decision and hope he is happy. 
Where my confusion lies is when he said it’s different for him. If he wants us to work again, why is he giving up on me? What is so ‘different’? Is leaving someone u used to love easy for guys? Just like that? Also, why was it hard for him to talk to me? Did he hate me that much or he is still in pain that hearing from me is hard for him.

I decided this month to download bumble since I’m on break and have nothing better to do, and lo and behold I come across his profile. What I noticed though is that on his profile, he stated that he’s looking for a relationship.

He said she was the one that got away. He said he doesn’t miss her, just the idea and that he screwed up their relationship with not taking it seriously. I asked him if he would ever get back with her aid he said no. I was drunk and stupidly said that this was the last time we should see each other. He sounded upset. Idk why I said that. I backtracked and apologized. He said I’m the first person he’s really liked in two years. And since he talked about his relationships, thought I would make it equal and say I know where he’s coming from and also have someone who got away…I pulled up my search on Facebook by accident and I was like…”oh look, you are my number one searched person” to where he pulled up his and showed I was also his most searched, but I saw where he looked up his ex.

80,rjpvip,1639891949,Meeting more women,"Hey people,
I'm going to be honest: I'm drunk and just feel like sharing my thoughts/asking for advice.

I've (M28) been single for around 2 years and trying to understand why I'm not meeting any women that have the potential to be a girlfriend.
I've been struggling to meet girlfriend material all my life. Up until 19 years old, I struggled with the image of being a nerd or geek and most girls in my ocial circle us myself saw me as nerdy. When I moved to another city and started university, I managed to build a new image and started dating sirously. I got to know new people, more women, but nothing serious. I switched between looking for a relationship and the mindset of taking what I get. I'm not a bad looking guy and I'm pretty athletic, not too confident initiating conversations, but able to hold a conversation, if it develops naturally. So I managed to get a few ONS and a fwb situation, but always struggled to build a real relationship. 

At 23 I got into a relationship. It lasted close to 4 years and looking back at it, I wish it wouldn't have been my first real relationship (I had 2 before, but both were kinda childish). Being confronted with a person I cared for so much and who loved me, was an experience I struggled to deal with. Looking back objectively I could have handled a lot of our fights a lot better and could have communicated my wants and needs in a different way.

Evaluating my long term relationship, I'm considering myself to be in a healthy mindset right now, to be able to start a new relationship while knowing what I want and communicating or solve any fights that come up.

Know I'm getting to my current struggles: after our break up I actually haven't met any potential partners naturally. I've moved to another city for an internship and lived in an apartment complex for students, young people and interns and moved back to the town I studied in. In these 2 years I tried online dating with tinder and using a local app (jodel - pretty sure it's a German thing) and only met 1 girls that sparked my interest. Me dated for around half  a year, but I didn't develop any serious emotions. We had a fwb situation and I ended things after moving. 

I'm an athlete on a semi-professional level, getting to know people through the sport, but most are living in other cities, started hanging out and doing a lot of activities in and outside with my friends and new people when I moved back and generally take part in any social event I get invited to. But meeting potential partners has been a struggle.
I'm living my life with open eyes, trying not to seem desperate, my friends know that I'm looking for a relationship (in case they want to set me up), using tinder (no other apps have a proper user base in my area) and nothing seems to work. 
I've been thinking about my past relationship and if I could recreate my luck in any way. But basically we got to know each other because she moved into the same flat I lived in before. So it was pure chance. I've considered my strengths and weaknesses in dating and came up with the following: when I spend time with people I know, acting naturally, women seem to fall for me. I had a couple situations, when women got invited by friends to house parties and went home with me after. Initiating conversations and flirting with women I don't have common friends with, hasn't been my strength in the past. I struggle to be interested in talking to them and get bored easily. 

Right now there are 2 thoughts in my mind considering my situation:

- the typical ""be yourself"": live your life. I have a hobby, go out, act naturally and while just enjoying my life the right woman will simply appear. This would definitely work towards my strengths of being able to appear attractive to women while interacting with my friends. But it never really worked in the past and I'm tired of hearing people say ""just be yourself"" or female friends asking me how my dating life is and ""how is it possible you're single""

- reaching out to women outside of my social circle: online dating doesn't work for me. I updated my profile using reviews from reddit and selecting my pics with photofeeler. But even if my profile could be improved further, I'm simply too selective while using dating apps and love interest really fast if we don't meet right away. So the only other option is cold approaching women. I'm going to be honest... I'm not feeling confident doing that. One part is me still having the unconscious self-image of being nerdy and unwanted and the other part is simply not having the opportunity in my daily life. When I'm shopping for groceries, I'm usually ignoring other people around me, have headphones on and just want to get done with it. When I'm out with friends I'm enjoying my time with them (plus bars and clubs aren't the best place to meet girlfriend material women). I'm just not the type of guy that spends time walking around in the city and feel kinda stupid when thinking about doing it with the sole purpose of looking around for women. I just don't want it to seem desperate or unnatural. 

This post is something between venting and looking for advice. Maybe there is an activity or hobby, I could try out (not just to meet women, but something that I also enjoy, so I can partake while increasing my chance to meet someone) or someone has a new thought about cold approaches I haven't considered yet.... don't know, what time expect. Just feel like sharing.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjpvip/meeting_more_women/
81,rjpz6o,1639892337,My crush left me on read but he doesn’t know I like him …,"So I met this guy at a concert I went to alone ends of October, we hit off since we both like the band playing and actually talked about other interest we had. I was expecting him at the end of the night to separate ways but ending up hanging around until I said goodbye. We exchanged igs and found out we had a friend in common, I don’t speak to that friend in common just follow em since it was high school. He offered a ride home since we found out we live a city away from each other. A week in I notice the friend in common started seeing my ig post and as well as this guy. I figured he bought me up about me to that friend in common since that person before would never see my stories. A month in I was hesitated to talk again to hangout but didn’t know how. I would like and make comments on his ig but that’s it. Last night I tried to start a convo but felt it was dead texting since I texted him late at night and went back in forth in the morning but it just felt so dead. Idk how to let him know I want to hangout with him since I can’t really tell if he has a gf but has a lot of “girls” who are his friend… he posted once a girl but can’t really tell if it was a friend or gf ?

This man came up to me engaged in conversation and seemed like he had a charm and persistence to him. Fast forward a day later and he is texting me constantly and engaging in texting back in forth all day. We hangout and he buys me roses and takes me out for my birthday dinner. The 4th date we end up being intimate together. Soon after,( you already know what’s coming) he begins to slowly fade away stops texting me back quickly and playing games. He won’t hit me up normally. He would just text and come over my house on a weekday then suddenly stop talking to me for 2 days during the weekend. He had the audacity to make up a fabrication and text me this the nerve!! He said I gave him a rash on his private area when we were protected and were safe the entire time. This is the reason he said he didn’t talk to me. I just can’t believe someone would go to this length to treat a person like this!! I obviously left him unread after he texted me saying some bullshit lie that he cared for me even though he accused me of giving him a rash. This devastated me. Why would someone go to lengths to lie and get someone’s pants and treat a person this way. I want a boyfriend someday and I’m getting so upset over these guys who are wolves in sheeps clothing.

But the summary is that my long term boyfriend of 3 years just stated that he intentionally “tested” me by blocking me on his cell phone to see if I would snoop, which I did. I just bought him a brand new iPhone 13 Pro max so his old one was lying around and I used it to look at his Instagram stories. I know that it was wrong but he has a history of blocking me from stories because he doesn’t want me to see anything. So am I the bad person for snooping?

I am attracted to him but don't entertain the idea of dating him just yet bc I want to get to know him.

But if I change my photos to candid shots of a guy with a different skin color and height all of a sudden it gets hundreds of matches?

I don't really get it. Everyone here says those things don't matter to women. But it seems they're everything since nothing else I can do works. My sisters are the same color as me and get hundreds of matches so that shouldn't be an issue.

What does this mean and what is the solution?

96,rjqrxp,1639895361,"New boyfriend is lovebombing, but love bombs everyone all the time.

Even complete strangers he met 60 seconds ago get very genuine and meaningful compliments. I asked his friend about this and apparently he’s been giving out those compliments for 5+ years. 

But as someone who’s just started dating him, that seems like a huge red flag for emotional abuse later down the line. 

He has low self worth at times, and could just be afraid of people not liking him. 

In the past he’s jumped into relationships very fast, gets very attached to them, and has been in a few abusive relationships (where he was the victim of abuse). 

It’s all very stressful, and I care about him a lot. It really does feel like a too good to be true situation since everything about us dating would be perfect. We get along very well and have spent 100ish hours together in the last 2 weeks. We want to live together and pursue our similar careers separately but nearby. 

It just all seems perfect, and maybe the lovebombing thing is just the way he is. Just looking for advice here 😅",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjqrxp/new_boyfriend_is_lovebombing_but_love_bombs/
