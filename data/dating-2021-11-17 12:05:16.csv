0,qw57fi,1637172534,Hookup Culture,"So basically matched Friday, talked over the weekend, met Monday evening for drinks, had sex. I knew this was just going to be a hookup from the get-go. 

I asked however if she wanted to do something again as I had a great time. She responded saying she had a good time too but wasn't looking for anything more than last night, but glad she had fun (fun being the sex I assume). I just said that's cool, I'm glad too, and that it was a nice meeting. 

My question is are hookups generally a one-time thing? I wasn't sure if the way I phrased it was as if I was looking for a relationship. It's not necessarily that I've got feelings I'd just be up for doing it again. The night wasn't bad or anything, but I'm just assuming this is the norm for hookup culture - meet once and have sex, then that's it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qw57fi/hookup_culture/
1,qw58lj,1637172620,"Too good too soon? Need a woman's perspective, please.","I was having a discussion with a guy friend. We each recently got out of a long term relationship, and the discussion went to dating and how it would ironically be a BAD thing if the women we dated were amazing right from the get-go - because we wouldn't know what else is out there, and that our worldviews would be skewed due to the small sample size of instantly hitting the jackpot.

Other guys I have talked to have tended to agree. But now, when the tables are turned, and it's the woman who just recently started dating again, if she meets an amazing guy right off the bat, does she think like this too, that it's too good too soon, and that she should keep dating to make sure she's got something good?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qw58lj/too_good_too_soon_need_a_womans_perspective_please/
2,qw59rx,1637172705,"""Just quit dating apps and try to meet people in person"" is easy to say thing, but it's hard to apply in real life. How are you actually supposed to meet people in real life when everyone is always rushing somewhere and doesn't want to get bothered?","The most frequent advice I see that's given to men struggling to get laid is to just stop using dating apps and go meet women in real life. And it's usually added that you should not try to meet them in clubs/bars but go for the quiet girl that works in library or find some hobby where you meet women and meet them ""naturally"" like it happens in movies. 

Clubs/bars are the only ""accepted"" place where I'm allowed to try to get women other than dating apps. And clubs are basically like dating apps but in real life - you can get the girl only if you're attractive... so basically the difference between dating app and club is very small. Though in club you can at least try to use your charm and not be judged ONLY by our looks like in dating apps.

Trying to meet women outside of clubs and dating apps is an absolute nightmare if you're not super hot. If you try to start a conversation they will get super uncomfortable and will think you try to scam them or beg for money. That's how fucked up communication has become - you can't even strike up conversations with random strangers anymore since there are so many of scammers out there on the streets that people stopped trusting each other completely.

And that is IF you actually get their attention. Everyone is glued to their phones and constantly messaging someone. How are you supposed to strike up a conversation with someone like that? Another group of people are the ones with headphones in - and we all know very well that having headphones/earbuds in public is an universal message - ""leave me the fuck alone"". You can't really meet women like this. They are always in the rush and always busy.

I managed to strike up a conversation a few times when waiting in public, but it all seemed so forced and uncomfortable that I ended it and felt embarrassed afterwards. They always answer quickly and smile uncomfortably.. the energy of ""please stop talking to me and leave alone already"" is literally radiating from them and it's physically detectable LOL. And this all is in the case when I actually manage to get an answer back without being ignored.

Another part of the ""advice"" I would like to address is the ""pick up some hobby where you meet women"". OK, first of all, that doesn't work for everyone. There are men who's hobbies are heavily male dominated and deliberately picking up a hobby where are women is painfully transparent and will not yield any real results, in fact will actually even hurt guys options more since he will be seen as ""dishonest"" for doing a hobby just meet some girl. Secondly, even if the man genuinely enjoys a hobby that has a fair amount of women in it, it's still considered creepy and inappropriate to hit on women in a hobby group, if the guy is not hot and the girls aren't already attracted to him, then it's a completely different story.

&amp;#x200B;

The only way I see people getting sex/relationships outside of dating apps and clubs is through mutual friends/acquaintances or sheer luck. Someone who doesn't have big family and group of friends is basically left alone and no one cares. The only two options for someone like that are either get hot and then basically you don't even need to drop dating apps anymore since hot men get attention from women on dating sites or somehow try to get friends and get close to some family which is in my opinion highly inappropriate and I personally wouldn't do it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qw59rx/just_quit_dating_apps_and_try_to_meet_people_in/
3,qw5boe,1637172848,Ex dating someone else but wants to be with me,"So, I’m in a pretty weird predicament but am trying to make sense of this. My ex broke up with me earlier this summer a month after starting an internship in another state (we live together, all of her things are still here, and we were in a serious relationship with talks of marriage) due to many issues in our relationship that I had exacerbated and caused, especially once we became long distance. I won’t lie and pretend I was a great partner. I was not. I was very emotionally immature throughout our relationship, and caused her a lot of hurt in that regard. I have been working ever since to correct this and be a better partner for her and ensure those mistakes are not repeated.

We had talked here and then since the breakup happened, but had also been NC for a bit as well. Earlier this month, she reached out to me and told me she is seeing someone else, but that it isn’t permanent as she won’t be there permanently (her internship is supposed to end in two months), she is emotionally unavailable and still deeply invested in our relationship and in love with me. She talked about missing me, our life and our relationship. As we’ve talked, she’s told me that seeing someone else helps her to get a better understanding of how she wants to be treated, what our relationship could gain and other things we could both bring to our relationship. She’s been serious from the start about wanting to come home, wanting to be with me and being in love with me. Admittedly, I was hurt by this and did block her, but she found a way to reach out to me and then offered to compromise, which I will get into.

I was naturally very uncomfortable with this, and told her to compromise. She was originally going to stay a full year at the internship while dating this person in the interim (she would have extended from January to June), and I told her that regardless of what I did, if we both want to be together, we need to be able to compromise and show each other that we are committed to each other if we are both talking about wanting to be with each other. She did so, and is coming back in two months and offered to break up with him until she comes home and we get back together (she is rightfully uncomfortable being in an LDR with me after what went down, which I was fine with). She’s been very open in communicating with me, and when I asked her if the only reason she was reaching out to me was because her current relationship was failing, she made clear that was not the case but that the person she is seeing now isn’t and could never be me. She also told me she works with him, has stayed at his place and even goes to work with him and comes back to his place, and that he is very supportive, but it still isn’t the same as being with me at all. It’s a very weird situation. I don’t feel like an option. I feel as if he is an option, even if he is aware of the situation, knows it isn’t permanent and knows about me. She has never posted about him publicly on any social media (we are still mutuals and all) nor even hinted at this. I don’t personally feel like dating someone else when you are still in love with me is okay, especially for the person she is seeing, but it’s what it is. She’s talked about how it is common to see other people when we’re broken up, but the circumstances in this case are very weird.

I do plan to get back with her if she is indeed coming home in less than two months, but I will say this entire circumstance is odd in every sense. She’s been consistent on wanting to be with me, and where I stand with her, but it still feels weird and I don’t know if this is a rebound or if this is odd, even if both of them are okay with this arrangement and understand that she will get back together with me. I should also note that we are both monogamous, and aren’t together, although it basically feels like that even if we aren’t doing the things we would do in a relationship right now. She’s told me to trust her, and to not assume the worst of her and that if I were replaceable like I had felt, she would have just moved down there and never compromised with me at all even after everything I did in our relationship. I trust her, but I will admit the situation is definitely complex right now.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qw5boe/ex_dating_someone_else_but_wants_to_be_with_me/

I have been talking with a girl(20F) for a few weeks now. (Check my other posts on my profile for details) and today she told me that her best friend hooked up with a guy she hooked up a few months back. On this topic, I told her that I'm still a virgin after dating 2 years. And her response was ""oh damn thats sad fuck😂"". Which kinda hurt me. Idk why though. It felt l like she was turned off. Idk what to do. I have asked to meet her and everytime there's something which comes in our way. We are supposed to meet friday, at least that's what she had said earlier. If we do meet, what do I do? Like I am kinda insecure about it now. 

I sent her a freaky post on Instagram which basically said ""do you want me to come over and eat your p***y till you cum on my face"" and she said ""I'm always down"". But this before I told her I'm virgin (fml). What the fuck am I supposed to do? I'm so confused and insecure now. Please help.

This is the first time I'm talking to a girl after my breakup.Ive been starved of any kind of intimacy for over a year now so I really want this to go correct. Like I feel a bit desperate but I'm not gonna show it obviously. And this girl is way out of my league. Ik everyone says you shouldn't think that etc. But she's a solid 10 I'm somewere near 7(that's what I'd rate myself). Like idek what to talk over text with her she's that hot. This makes me even more timid. I'm trying not to be and I've told her I'm interested in her. So that's out of the way. And I've been straightforward so far as well. But still idk what to do.

5,qw5ioi,1637173386,undesirable personality traits for a guy to have.,"I actually don't feel that strongly about my gender one way or another but I realize I have traits that are more feminine and that has not really helped me when it comes to dating. for instance, the whole empathic sensitive nice guy is usually seen as needy or fake but sadly in my case that is just my default persona it doesn't feel like a mask to me, and I don't like being a dick. even joking around I'm not the kind of person to play fight I'm just more chill I guess. It's likely what keeps me in the friend zone.  I don't mind being friends, but it sucks when getting used just so they can get closer to your friend or have you as a backup sympathizer makes them feel more secure and you feel more like you're just some background character getting used as a prop. I enjoy being who I am and acting the way I do and i don't think it's wrong it's not hurting anyone if anything my friends like me because I'm more laid back chill and just a nice guy but in this society, nice guys get seen as boring or needy or easy or fake.   


another thing that complicates things for stereotypical gender roles is i am generally more recessive personality and very mutable. Assertiveness and decisive traits are what I look for in a partner because I lack those qualities personally. I'm not assertive or decisive I am floaty and like all kinds of things get distracted easily and more abstract creative look at life in a weird way and not as stable as I may appear on the outside. a lot of women like guys that know what they want and that are confident in the way they carry themselves and sadly a lot of guys that act that way tend to be narcissit. I find it disappointing that both genders find narcissists so attractive. I bet it happens that way a lot for women too liking guys that end up falling for a narcissist so i know it's an issue both genders are faced within the dating world.  


I guess I'm curious how others feel or if anyone else fit in this category that struggles with romantic relationships and what you'd suggest working on or looking for as a partner.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qw5ioi/undesirable_personality_traits_for_a_guy_to_have/

8,qw5q0w,1637173959,How to go through this,"Hi,  before (Sorry for my english) it is about a girl I met in my job. Since  I started there she looked at me all time. Cute face, charming eyes. I  felt in love for her. We started talking and everything was good, good  vibe between us. One day she offered me a ride to take me home (my car  wasn't working). After some rides she added me on snapchat but never  talked to me to know how I am or know me more. The only who texted her  was me. There I started to think what is wrong (literally 1 whole week  no talking to me there).

One day she told me about moving to another state but she wasn't sure so I didn't care that much about that.

Only  in the job she was caring about me. After a while I told her I like  her, she said she likes me too, one day on a ride she olded my hand all  the trip, I kissed her twice when we arrived, her best friend told me  she called her freaking out to tell about it. (5 days ago since that)  Everything was good, she loved to look at me and play with me all time  and I thought she wasn't moving. But yesterday her best friend told me  to leave her, she decided to move and that's why she was kind of dry  with me last days. That hurts a lot because I haven't had any affection  from someone I like since long time, years. All this happened in 1 month  and half, I know it's some dumb to fell for someone that fast and I  just want to stop being like that, rn I feel so sad.

22,qw6d1v,1637175732,"Girl wants to move to my city, very very strong 2 months of long distance dating, cold turkey overnight. What happened?","TL;DR (it'd be cool if ya did): Girl I have been very seriously talking with who wants to move to my city stops talking to me seemingly overnight, despite us having super strong feelings for each other.

Quick note: I know this timeline seems short but like any of you know, romantic things can progress very quickly and suddenly. (Apologies up front for the long post, but I know we all live vicariously through one another on these dating subs so I know we're all invested in the plots lol)

So I (25M) matched with a girl (23F) on bumble 2 months ago. She was visiting my city (with the intent of moving there eventually). She went back home 500 miles away before we even got to meet in person. But right away we got to talking and flirting.

We quickly learned a lot about each other, I even told her about my upbringing and my parents' long drawn out divorce that left an impact on me in high school, and even my abuse from my dad. She told me about her past, but also said that there's some stuff that she barely shares with anyone, so I respected that and told her to only tell me what she's comfortable with. Both of us had come out long of relationships recently: me (3.5 years ending in May), her (?? ending in June, but from what I remember it was serious like mine)

We find that we're both into similar things, certain video games, or shows (we're both huge Mando fans), even hobbies like film photography. She's downright one of the cutest people I've met. We learned about each other's favorite foods and, to my dismay, I find out she's quite picky (I will eat anything that's not a bug). For some people this wouldn't seem like an issue but food is my love language and this was definitely a minus for me. It's relationship defining for me :(

Texting and Snapchatting are going strong for a couple weeks (instantly becoming Bff's on the app) and she eventually calls me for the first time and we get to actually converse and hear each other's voices. We even start leaving voice messages for each other. This starts a trend of us calling each other that leads into FaceTiming and starting what seemed like a pseudo long distance relationship.

We would talk about when she could find time off work during the upcoming holiday to visit, or if I would be able to fly out to her since my work allows me to take off whenever. We'd talk about plans for her to move, like what would need to happen with her job, or the fact that she wants to leave because of her boss and not being given raises or chances to move up. She was even looking at air bnbs for later in the year but was still hesitant because of how busy work gets during the holidays starting Thanksgiving time (her work has a charity thing that takes up a lot of time that part of the year). She also really wants to leave her state (very pop punk of her lol).

She has a medical condition that'll cause repeated headaches/migraines and body aches that'll render her unresponsive over communication because she needs rest. There'll be some days where she seems to go radio silent for hours and hours and then she'll snap me an hour before bed about her condition. I feel so bad that she has to suffer through something like this. So I quickly became used to the fact that there'd be some days that she will open multiple snaps but not respond. This took some adjusting for me but we're both adults and I respected that sometimes she just needed a moment to herself.

We were both so into each other and one evening we even stayed up until 4am sending nude photos back and forth until both of us finished (apologies if TMI but it provides context). Maybe a week or two later, we were on the phone talking about sexual things like kinks and what our wildest sex stories are, things we've done with past partners even. Eventually we were talking about favorite positions and, next thing you know, both of us admitted that we had been touching ourselves during the conversation and ended up having phone sex (again, apologies for TMI, it's for the plot lol). She asks me if we are still friends and that this isn't just sexual in nature, and I tell her of course we are absolutely friends. After this we would end up sending each other lewd photos every couple mornings as a ""hey you're hot, I'm hot"" kinda thing.

Over thing to note is that we talked about exclusivity after that night, and agreed that since we haven't met in person we would stay open because we didn't want each other to feel obligated to what is basically an eventuality. Not the most modest of things to add, but we are both what society would consider pretty ""attractive"" so we know that we both have not a lot of trouble getting noticed by others. I asked if she was talking with anyone else and she said no she was too busy for anyone other than me, and I admitted to her that I had started conversations with a few people but they always fizzled out.

Fast forward a couple weeks and things are going very strong (still virtually, of course). I'm working on a new project and I'm busy for 12 hours out of the day. She'd call me at random times at work and I'd pick up if I can and we'd have lovely cute and quick conversations before I'd have to jump back into work. Those became my favorite little nuggets of my day. Surprisingly she even sent me a snap one day that said ""ily 💖"" which felt big to me, even though the actual words weren't said.

Now a few weeks ago there was a day that she wasn't feeling so great. Apparently something had happened in her past that she was nowhere close to ready to share. Of course I decided to give her the day and let her reach out to me the next day when she was all good.

Around that same time she reminded me that her work was starting the charity stuff and that she'd be really busy. Despite this, she still found moments to call me at work and I'd reciprocate whenever I could and over the weekends. Things were going fantastic even with our busy schedules. We even came close to coming up with a plan for the air bnb stuff when she would come down to visit, like agreeing to jointly paying for it because she was now going to be visiting for me and to look around the city more for possible areas to live.

Here's where things changed.

This Sunday I noticed that our BFF emoji went away on Snapchat (I know, sooo high school of me). I thought it was a bug of some kind so I tell her I'm still at the top of my list and she tells me I'm not longer at the top of hers. My stupid immature ape brain kicks in and this kind of throws me off little. I know we both agreed we weren't exclusive but things were so intense and strong that it seemed like we had every intention of starting to date once she can down to visit. I make a joke about losing the bff status and she just sends laughing emojis and tells me I'm silly. To which I send her the ""immeasurable disappointment"" meme and she sends more laughing emojis. Funny thing is that she playfully told me I was in her dream the night before (not sure what context but that's probably good right?). I end up not pushing any further regarding the Snapchat subject.

Monday morning I send her a voice memo acknowledging my weird energy regarding the situation and that I just had to remind myself that we weren't exclusive and that she has free reign to talk to whomever, despite us practically having a long distance relationship. I did reference that we seemed to have treated each other as if we were dating even though we technically weren't. I made sure the tone of the message was reassuring and supportive and happy. And I wrapped it up just saying that I appreciate our time together and I really do like her and I want her to keep doing her thing while I do mine.

She responds over text later in the morning saying:

""Haha good morning! I’m not talking to anybody else. But also I think I just need to focus on myself first before trying to distract myself into another relationship. You still don’t know a lot and I’m not ready to share that. But I do enjoy our talks and being friends 💛""

I ""love"" her message and respond with:

""That's totally cool! And yes please take care of yourself first! I want you to be the best version of yourself before starting a relationship. The amount of respect I have for you for wanting to make yourself better is immense. And I will be the best friend to you I can be in this process! I really do enjoy our talks 💛 thank you for opening up to me""

She then ""loves"" my message and we go about our day.

I send her a text about my work activities for the day and she doesn't respond. I send her a snap and she leaves me on read. This happens a lot but she always comes back around. I then send her 4 more (spread over 7 hours), just of fun work shenanigans (I work in a cool industry) and she leaves them all on read. I figured she might need one of her days off so I don't bother her the rest of the day.

Yesterday (Tuesday) morning she sends me only one snap about her crazy bed hair and I respond with a photo of mine. I then go into the chat and tell her that she doesn't need to tell me what's going on and that I know she might've needed some time to herself. And that I'm here for her if she needs. And the responds with ""Thank you!"" I only send her one more snap the rest of the day to which she leaves it on read. I don't bother her the rest of the day. Despite this silence she posts a photo of the city on her story. And she ended up watching all of the Instagram stories from my fun work happenings.

Now it's today and I have received no contact at all. This very morning I noticed she's was awake and watched some of my ig stories from last night when my team finished the project.

It seems like overnight all her feelings changed. And we're not ones to lie about talking with other people (we've been quite open about that subject). This was so cold turkey and I know she wouldn't appreciate me doing the same thing to her. We both got so much joy out of talking with each other, and even the Saturday just before this Sunday, when all the snapchat stuff happened, we where in FaceTime for an hour talking all lovely dovey.

I can't figure out if it's something I did/said, or how I should proceed forward. I really like this girl and she really seemed to like me, and this seems so out of character. Could there be some external thing on her end that changed her mind? Was it because I referenced that we were at some degree of dating and that scared her? Was it because I possibly put a label on it, despite us being extremely committed to the idea of seriously dating? Like everything was pointing to us actually dating once she came down to visit and I have no clue how things could change so drastically in a day.

I can't say whether or not either of us had plans of ""going the distance,"" and there are some qualities about her that I could foresee being a little rocky. But one of my biggest mistakes-leading-into-lessons from my most recent relationship of 3.5 years was listening listening listening, and understanding that some people are built a little different, but if you care enough, you'll find a way to work with them. I was actually applying that lesson to my time with this girl and it felt amazing and that's why I feel at such a loss because I felt like I had grown as a person and I was committed to doing something right.

Like a lot of you, I hate when ambiguous portions of our lives pop up, and I despise the person I become when I spiral like this.

23,qw6enp,1637175853,Let's share our stories about being ghosted by people.,"So, I once matched with a guy on some dating site and apparently he was from the same city. We talked for a while and I told him how I like ""old school things"" and he asked me out. 
We met at a restaurant and he got a rose for me which was like the SWEETEST thing someone could have done for me. Also because people don't usually get each other flowers these days. And I remember sneaking the rose into my house. 

We also talked about how people on dating sites reply so late, aren't good with conversations and also ghost so much. We talked for two days and he went out of town for some work. We had already planned our second date. But as soon as he went out of town he just ghosted me???
Everything was going great but he just ghosted me out of nowhere and I don't know why he did that till date.

So, this was one of my stories.

Is it because I have kids?,"I'm 26, a single mom of two little boys, and in college. I don't have much free time and I feel like men don't like that. They see that I have prior obligations and might prefer a woman who can drop everything and adhere to their needs whenever it's convenient for them. 

I'm attractive, have a nice figure, smart, good taste, and I like to think I'm funny. I'm not saying this because I'm a narcissist. I'm saying this because I realize my good traits after years of hating myself. I still hate myself but I know I have lots to offer someone. 

So basically I've just been on tinder to meet men (I'm bi, and like women too but I'm not looking for a relationship with a woman right now), and it hasn't been going very well. I put in my bio I'm not looking for hookups, because I'm not. I'm over being used for sex and being ghosted right after I give someone my body. I want someone to be actually interested in me. Is that too much to ask for in this day and age? Probably. No one really wants true connection anymore. It's hit it and quit it. 

I have a feeling it's because I have kids. If I see a man I'm interested in and he doesn't have kids, there's a huge chance he won't share the same interest and only wanna hook up. Well, my kids aren't going anywhere. I've felt so alone these past few years. I know im good enough for someone.

Don’t get me wrong, but I never meet someone at his home when it comes to a first date. He also suggest to take a walk at the evening, but that’s something that I like to do by day, cause as a woman I find that much safer.

We used to communicate via our work numbers. He has a dual sim phone I think, One day he made an excuse to text me from his personal number, maybe it was true, no clue. Mostly Responds very immediately to my texts, which is great, also not sure if he’s being professional. 
He put up a ton of his own photographs As his status, now I think it might have been visible only to me? Coz he didn’t seem the type to do such a thing. But giving him the benefit of the doubt maybe not. Also I posted about something, he posted the same aspect of his life within minutes.

32,qw72qq,1637177735,I need help or words of advice about an ex,"So my 7 year long term girlfriend broke up with me about a month ago. I totally saw it coming and was prepared for it. We have been long distance since covid and a month ago she said she felt trapped and didn’t want to do this anymore. The feeling was pretty mutual, and since she did this over text I got over it very quick. She lives in California and me in Colorado. I moved out there months after she took a new job and I just hated it down there. We weren’t living together, and were separated by 70 miles. Before this we lived together for 5 or so years and I was with her during her grad school which was very hard on her and supported her through it. During this time and even in Cali our sex life was none existent. I’m talking maybe 5 or so times a year. I felt more like a friend then a bf but knew she was going through some shit and wanted to see her through it. I felt very under appreciated and not loved. Then in July of this year we went to Vegas and had an amazing time. We boned so much I had road rash. We held hands and shared laughs and honestly it felt like a dream. Then the next two times we visited eachother it was back to nothing again. I’ve brought up marriage a ton of times and she expressed she did not want that with me. Come to find out this whole time she has been dealing with depression/anxiety and just got medicated for it. Fast forward to after the breakup.
After about a week or so I just joined a dating app on a whim. Not looking for or expecting anything and then got matched with a very interesting and beautiful girl. We went out on a couple of dates and I have been spending the night. She did a video of a date we had on ig and I shared it and almost immediately my ex texts me about it. Saying your dating already!! How could you and this and that. I started feeling really shitty about it and then she told me that she wanted me to fight for her after the breakup and all this other bs. I told her we wanted different things and I’m 32 now and I need to get on with my life. Meanwhile this other girl is getting very attached and talking about the future which I really like but at the same time I don’t know if I’m feeling the same just yet. She’s moving a little too fast. Then last night while I’m sleeping at her place my ex keeps texting and texting and try’s calling me. Then on my drive into work she explains how much she misses me, wants me, wants a life with me. Goes into how she is getting treated for her depression and can see clearly now. Like, I always wanted to be with her but I totally detached myself from her and jumped into another relationship which I feel like shit about now. My ex now wants us to meet somewhere via plane, probably to hook back up and now I feel like I’m leading this other girl on and BLAHHH. I don’t know what to do. I obviously have long term feelings for her but now I don’t know what to do with this other girl. I’ve never broken up with someone before.

35,qw77h6,1637178116,Does she (20F) like me (20M) and if so....how do I ask her out?,"I (20M) have spoken to my (now) best friend (20F) for 6 months every day, where we have never stopped our conversations on Whatsapp, Instagram etc, our conversations always just carry on after we change the subject if it has died before. We met on the language learning app, Hellotalk, where we slowly moved onto other apps as we got to know each other more.

3 months ago , I moved to Barcelona from the UK to study, this is also where my friend lives. For the first few weeks before uni started for us both, we went out at least once a week, walking around getting to know each other (such as the zoo or sightseeing the Sagrada Familia). We talked about our families, friends, life and generally got to know each other really well, in a way you can't do through text.

Once term started for the both of us, we made sure to at least see each other during the week or on the weekend when we were free. At the same time, she introduced me to her friends in person and we all got on. She then invited to me to an escape room with her friends and a meal with them after.

On Halloween, me and my friend spent the whole day together. During the morning, we visited a castle with views of the city, sea and nearby airport. I made sure to pay for our entry tickets (like the British gentleman that I am haha). Every Halloween, my friend makes halloween biscuits with her mum. She gave half of them to me to try and waited until I tried them all to see what I thought.

Afterwards, we travelled back on the cable car to a nearby park, where we found lots of places ""where we could go and sit in, in the future"" and we promptly returned to the train station where we could go back home to get ready for the night. During the escape room, the lights turned off sporadically every now and then, where she held my hand to guide us through. Every time this happened, she made sure she was near me to hold my hand. She also grabbed me to hug me whenever someone charged through the room (since it was horror themed).

On the way back on the metro, there were a few spaces left to sit on the train. The 6 of us were split between those sat on the 5 seats available. I sat down thinking someone would join me, while the others were either standing or sitting. My friend and her friend's boyfriend were standing, holding onto the handrail. Where they were whispering to each other, looked at me and then my friend sat next to me for the remainder of the journey and made sure to hug me goodbye. Now, every time we go out, she makes it clear she wants to hug goodbye and initiates it.

I've also noticed that she has become a lot more touchy (such as tapping my arm to get my attention or tapping me whenever we talk) and always made an excuse to get me to sit closer to her. Her body language was open and was closer to me, I hope I'm not going to insane with all this haha! I've just been googling all this like I'm mad!

All my friends and family keep telling me that they think she's interested but as a slightly awkward person I have no idea how to tell! I like her though and don't want to ruin our friendship! It doesn't help she's the girl I've had the most in common with in my life. She doesn't like to drink, I don't like to drink. She likes all the things I do. And most importantly, she makes me feel less anxious and I really love spending time with her!

This Saturday, we are going to a theme park and I really want to ask her then!

If so, what’s the best way to ask her out? By phone or in person? Do I say “do you like me?” Or ask to go out on a date? Who knows?!

36,qw78c9,1637178183,Having Abandonment Anxiety While Going On Promising Dates,"I (33M) had a date last week with a woman (33F) that I didn't think was going to pan out but it went amazing. We are actually going to be going on our 3rd date tonight in the last rolling week here.

We instantly clicked and have had some rather deep conversations right off of the bat. We are both stable in our careers, chase our passions, close to our families, and have a solid group of friends.

On our last date last weekend, we both expressed how important mental health is and she was beyond impressed that I make an effort to keep that under control as I have anxiety and Aspergers. Neither of which concerned her. She also values bluntness and not sugar coating everything in our conversations which I value as well.

She found out my birthday was the day before this date, so she got me a mini pumpkin cheesecake for my birthday because I told her in passing that I loved pumpkin. I told her I wanted to kiss her which she leaned into before I could even finish the sentence. Mind you, this was only date 2. I've talked to her on the phone a few times and there is usually a good morning and good night text on the daily too. She even gave me her number first as I didn't ask for it right away.

Where I get hung up is that I'm waiting for her to ghost me or tell me she's not interested. It's happened with every other person I go out with. I know that's not fair to her at all. She also travels a lot for work so I'm also afraid of the ""out of sight, out of mind"" thing. She's repeatedly told me how sweet I am, how refreshing its been to talk to me, how easy I am to talk to, and the she loves spending time with me. Heck I even went to a concert last night and she kept telling me before she went to bed how happy she was for me that I got to go since its something that makes me happy.

I have a WFH IT admin job and she has a super busy and stressful event management job so I have way more free time to chat and unfortunately let my mind wander. She also isn't super great at texting and doesn't like to play with her phone a lot. As someone who is on tech all the time for work, I see it as an indicator if you can't text back. It takes 10 seconds. It's not hard. If you wanted to talk to me, you would. I've slightly hinted at this by asking what a normal communication cadence is which she wasn't quite sure of after having a really busy week. I told her that sometimes I just need to be told I'm doing fine as one of my love languages is Words Of Affirmations. She told me I'm ""doing more than fine"".

So here I am, having not heard back from a good morning text wondering what I did wrong and if this is the end. Like I said, this always has fallen apart for me in the past so my data says that this is going to as well. I look at the facts and it does't seem to reinforce that that though. We are both super open with our mental health already so I'm not sure if it's even worth bringing up that I do struggle with anxiety pretty badly. I'm sure tonight will go well and every future date has been set up on the spot of the date prior.

This is amazing but it sucks that I'm so terrified that it's just going to end in a ghost of her just being bored and done.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qw78c9/having_abandonment_anxiety_while_going_on/

I was 16, and didn't know how to treat a girl, and I guess I still don't, but I'll attempt not to do that anymore. Still, though I felt like I cared deeply for her. My life revolved around that girl. I was devastated when what happened, happened. It's a whole story I may tell some other time. A while after the fact, I started getting on dating apps because I was lonely.

I've dealt with being single for a while, but I keep screwing it up with girls, so I get extremely interested in a girl, then I get let down. I've had so many let-downs by this point, (on dating apps, and not) that I don't think I can feel that way for someone, anymore. All I can do is appreciate someone. I have empathy, and I can appreciate, and I can like someone, but girls, and almost all people in general are just numbers to me, now. We're all just bags of meat, waiting to become inanimate.

I WANT to love. I just wanna be normal. I posted a few days ago stating that I don't believe in love. Well, honestly, I don't know how I feel, anymore. I'm just tired of being lonely. I can continue on, and continue my life myself, but I don't want to do the whole thing alone, and now I'm scared it'll happen. I could go to hell when I die, I don't care, but God, don't leave me alone in life.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qw85a8/i_dont_know_if_i_can_fall_in_love_anymore/

54,qw8ljj,1637182047,Does my friend (20F) like me (20m)?,"I (20M) have spoken to my (now) best friend (20F) for 6 months every day, where we have never stopped our conversations on Whatsapp, Instagram etc, our conversations always just carry on after we change the subject if it has died before. We met on the language learning app, Hellotalk, where we slowly moved onto other apps as we got to know each other more.

3 months ago , I moved to Barcelona from the UK to study, this is also where my friend lives. For the first few weeks before uni started for us both, we went out at least once a week, walking around getting to know each other (such as the zoo or sightseeing the Sagrada Familia). We talked about our families, friends, life and generally got to know each other really well, in a way you can't do through text.

Once term started for the both of us, we made sure to at least see each other during the week or on the weekend when we were free. At the same time, she introduced me to her friends in person and we all got on. She then invited to me to an escape room with her friends and a meal with them after.

On Halloween, me and my friend spent the whole day together. During the morning, we visited a castle with views of the city, sea and nearby airport. I made sure to pay for our entry tickets (like the British gentleman that I am haha). Every Halloween, my friend makes halloween biscuits with her mum. She gave half of them to me to try and waited until I tried them all to see what I thought.

Afterwards, we travelled back on the cable car to a nearby park, where we found lots of places ""where we could go and sit in, in the future"" and we promptly returned to the train station where we could go back home to get ready for the night. During the escape room, the lights turned off sporadically every now and then, where she held my hand to guide us through. Every time this happened, she made sure she was near me to hold my hand. She also grabbed me to hug me whenever someone charged through the room (since it was horror themed).

On the way back on the metro, there were a few spaces left to sit on the train. The 6 of us were split between those sat on the 5 seats available. I sat down thinking someone would join me, while the others were either standing or sitting. My friend and her friend's boyfriend were standing, holding onto the handrail. Where they were whispering to each other, looked at me and then my friend sat next to me for the remainder of the journey and made sure to hug me goodbye. Now, every time we go out, she makes it clear she wants to hug goodbye and initiates it.

I've also noticed that she has become a lot more touchy (such as tapping my arm to get my attention or tapping me whenever we talk) and always made an excuse to get me to sit closer to her. Her body language was open and was closer to me, I hope I'm not going to insane with all this haha! I've just been googling all this like I'm mad!

All my friends and family keep telling me that they think she's interested but as a slightly awkward person I have no idea how to tell! I like her though and don't want to ruin our friendship! It doesn't help she's the girl I've had the most in common with in my life. She doesn't like to drink, I don't like to drink. She likes all the things I do. And most importantly, she makes me feel less anxious and I really love spending time with her!

He(23m) broke up with me(24f) 2 months ago after a 4 year, hard, stressful relationship. So much life stuff going on for us both, and he didnt know what he wants. At first I begged, pleaded, he wanted to stay friends, I tried. We talked regularly at first and still saw eachother once a week, usually all contact was indicated by me. Then fell off a bit with a weekly catch up. Then for the last 3 weeks I havent seen him, but we'd still talk, and last week text once a day or so. He wanted to see me and my son last friday, but cancelled because of some drama with his dad.




I had stopped being the one to reach out first about a month ago, because I figured if he cared to talk to or see me hed reach out to me first and initiate. After a week of me not contacting him, he did. I started replying or answering his calls. He would say the first two weeks he does wanna see me and hang out, but was too busy. Cool whatever I got stuff to do anyway. Then last friday he made plans but cancelled. Now this morning I woke up to a text about dinner tonight. I texted back around noon and accepted, because I've been busy and didnt wanna deal with it while doing school. 




But I'm just confused. I dont really get why or what the point is? Any dumpers have any advice or idea what the motive could be? I'm trying to fall out of love using distance and he knows that.

Obviously part of the purpose of FWB is that you don’t have to put in tons of energy into it like a romantic relationship, so some nights I assume it’s okay to just come over, fuck, cuddle a bit and leave.

So far, we’ve mostly not seen each other more than 1-2x a week, and usually one of us would do something (like make dinner or drinks) so it doesn’t feel routine. But as we get more comfortable, we’re also getting hornier and want to see each other more. 

My concern is that seeing each other more could lead to boredom and taking each other for granted. In which case, I would just try to limit our encounters rather than allow things to get stale.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qw9jzi/keeping_things_interesting_with_fwb/
69,qw9mya,1637185083,The girl I like (ex) opened up to me just to regret telling me about it later…,"My ex (20F) and I (21M) had a tough break up. It ended on good terms so there’s that. So after a couple months I decided to apologize to her for my part. Initially she became furious so I explained to her that I did mistakes that I can change so all I can do is to ask her for forgiveness and she did forgive me. And that was it for my part. I was about to just move on but then she started talking to me. And I talked back. Just for us both to realize that we still haven’t gotten over each other yet. It’s been about 4 weeks since we’ve been talking. I’ve always liked her. Before we started dating we were best friends who had feelings for each other but was too scared to express considering it might ruin our friendship. Eventually I did express and it turned out to be exactly what I wanted. Today all of a sudden, she decided to tell me about a childhood trauma of hers. She got sexually harassed by a cousin of hers and her mom took it as a joke. She said she’s gone through that everyday. So I did what I should have done, I tried to comfort her and make her realize she was strong enough to go through all of that. I told her it doesn’t matter if anyone thinks that it’s awful she got harassed, and it’s not bad to open up about it. All that matters is she went through all of that and that I am proud of her. Then she told me never to talk to her about this again and pretend we never had this conversation. And told me doesn’t need my sympathy and she doesn’t want to seem like she’s seeking attention from me. All because I tried to comfort her. I got confused and told her that she shouldn’t have opened up to me to begin with if she was gonna regret telling me about it later. She said that I deserved to know about it. I replied to her that I don’t think I deserve to know about it if she’s not comfortable enough to tell me about it. She told this story to her ex (the one she dated after me) and a mutual friend of ours. She regret telling her ex about this since they ended up on bad terms. And so I believe that she might have regret telling me about this as well. I felt disappointed and told her not talk to me about her life anymore until she’s comfortable enough to trust me with it. I even told her that she’s special to me as a friend and more than that. And that I don’t give a shit about what she think of me. If she think I’m a jerk or a pathetic fool or a loser? I dont care. She then said goodnight and slept. And she “seenzoned” my text. Now I know it must be hard for her to open up to me about these  blood spilled pages of her life. But why would she tell me if she doesn’t trust me with it? How did she expect me to react to this? Please help a brother out.

75,qwajhy,1637187719,"Reassurance needed (or I am a crazy person, calm me down)","I’m (F early 30s) in need of some advice, or maybe just reassurance. I have ADHD with rejection sensitive dysphoria (basically an extreme fear of rejection brought on by the ADHD), so I sometimes misinterpret things and blow things out of proportion. 

Here’s the story…

I met a guy through my roommate, slid into his DMs, and have been talking to him since the beginning of October. We have a lot in common and I really enjoy talking to him. I met him in person for the first time last Saturday at a party my roommate and I had. When he first arrived we hugged, there was a bit of awkwardness but it disappeared quickly, and he really only talked to me all night (he only talked to other people if they came up to us). At the end of the night I walked him to his car and we hugged, it was a long hug, and he said “let’s hang out again soon, yeah?” I agreed. Later, he texted me and thanked me for inviting him and said he had a good time.

This was great, but he only hugged me twice, he didn’t touch me much otherwise, and we didn’t kiss. I’m used to men being very sexually straight forward with me. Even men that I’ve had relationships with, haven’t waited to initiate things, so this is making me think he just wants to be friends.

We’ve talked every day since Saturday. 

Last night I texted him and asked if he wants to hang out this weekend. He didn’t reply. This morning I messaged him again about something unrelated, he replied to both messages then. He said he can’t hang out because he’s visiting family. This is okay, obviously, but him not replying for so long upset me in a weird way, and is making me think he doesn’t actually like me and he didn’t mean it when he suggested hanging out again. 

Like I said, I have rejection sensitivity so I’m thinking all the bad things now. I’m probably an idiot, but I need some reassurance.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qwajhy/reassurance_needed_or_i_am_a_crazy_person_calm_me/

- She drives me home from work all the time (she always offers, or more like insists).

- Her and I have lengthy text convos, sometimes way past midnight. She sends heart emojis to me too. On my birthday she texted me first thing in the morning, and spent the rest of the day texting me.

- She called me cute or complimented my features multiple times.

- She always suggests that we make plans to hang out after work (for drinks, see a movie, go to a concert)

- she talks about me all the time to my coworkers (I had coworkers tell me that she asks about me all the time). She told me she's talked about me to her mom.

- She told me all her boyfriends have been the same ethnicity as I am.

- She told me that I was the only reason she hadn't quit the job.

So as I mentioned before, the whole time this was going on, she had a boyfriend. About a week ago I saw that she changed her relationship status to ""Single"" on facebook, and deleted all the pictures of her boyfriend, so she had broken up with him. I worked a shift this past weekend with her, and she purposefully brought up that her and her boyfriend had broken up (she said ""I'm sick of everyone asking me why I broke up with my boyfriend""). I pretty much didn't react and said ""I could see that getting annoying"".

I've put in my two weeks (I'm getting a job as a dev), and my last shift is this weekend. I told the girl it's my last shift and she said she was going to skip her shift this weekend because she's working another job and would only be able to work 2 hours of the shift where I work. I said ""you should come in anyway, hang out with me on my last day"" and she said she would and that she's doing it for me.

So idk guys, I want to ask her out, but I want to get your guys opinion first if you think I have a shot.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qwaw3b/i_really_like_this_girl_but_im_getting_mixed/

We had a phone conversation the other day and he had stated that if he wanted he could persuade me to spend all my wage on him. That to me is massive red flag.

91,qwbumf,1637191547,THE DISRESPECT IS THE CLOSURE!!,"I 22F have to be honest. When it comes to dating and being in relationships I have let men...ahem...boys.. walk all over me. I've changed my appearance, my personality, the people I was friends with, the type of music I listened to, etc. for people in the past who were not deserving. Why? I don't know. Maybe you can say a large part of it is insecurity, not thinking I was good enough, lack of confidence, not wanting to feel rejected, etc. 

After my last really horrific relationship that caused me to lose myself completely along with everything good in my life, I've been focused on rebuilding my confidence and working deeply on myself.  I am beginning to realize my worth and today I cut off a guy who I've been talking to for quite some time. He repeatedly stands me up and then asks for my forgiveness and promises to never do it again, only to turn around and do it 500 more times. I am guilty of always going back to him in fear of me missing out on ""my person"". But today I finally told myself that ""my person"" would never treat me like that. 

How do I expect others to treat me well and care deeply for me when I can't even give myself that same love and compassion? So I told him ""I have no to hate towards you, but I need to respect myself enough to walk away from someone who does not respect me"" and that was the end. While at first, I was mad that his response was just ""ok I understand"" and that he wasn't fighting for me to stay, I realized how much of a blessing it actually was. Him not caring even as I was walking away has given me the backbone to trust the red flags and realize that I do not need closure. The disrespect is the closure.  

I'm sure no one will see this or have anything to say to it but I wanted to write it so I can express, even if it's just to myself, how proud of myself I can for choosing me for once.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qwbumf/the_disrespect_is_the_closure/

97,qwc6vt,1637192571,Scared my date doesn't realise I'm overweight,"Hi people, 

I have a date tomorrow and I'm incredibly nervous. We met on tinder around a month ago and have been slowly building up a text relationship over the past weeks. It is safe to say we are both incredibly into each other and share a lot in common. This chemistry is actually just making me nervous. 

The issue is that we are both in entirely different weight classes and it is giving me anxiety. I am literally double her weight and afraid she doesn't realise this. 

I have made every effort to make this clear without coming across as a huge insecure weirdo. I've sent many full body pictures and at least half my tinder pictures are full body. Maybe she is just into my body type? But I find it difficult when she is probably underweight and I'm fairly far in the obese category.

I'm seeking advice on the whole situation. How should I have it if I turn up and it is awkward because I've been an accidental catfish? I'm feeling awful about this and should be happy. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qwc6vt/scared_my_date_doesnt_realise_im_overweight/
