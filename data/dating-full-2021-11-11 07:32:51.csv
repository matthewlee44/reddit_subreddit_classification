She's a cool work colleague and great to have a laugh with. Professionaly  we work very well together. Lately I have found that she is flirting more openly and more often. I am 14 years older. So naturally I'm a little uncomfortable when someone who was recently a minor is trying to flirt and act jealous when I joke with other female staff. I have sometimes caught her in the corner of my eye just looking at me while I'm working. Othertimes she and another young colleague will try to get selfies with me while I'm busy. 

And at this point I have to say that I am attracted and flattered by her flirting. But feel guilty being attracted and this is where im having a problem.

What should I do ?

We initially met about 2 years ago but it was just small talk and after sometime she left my workplace to go somewhere else (personal reason I assume). And soon after she left I was in a toxic relationship  for about 1 year that ended back in August.  Fast forward to late September I met her and we've got along so well, hung out several amount of times, its been hard to hang out with her because she does have kids. She had just got out of a relationship herself but at the time I saw her nothing more than just a friend.

 Later on after a couple hang outs, she openly admitted that she was catching feelings for me and wanted to kiss me so badly but held back. Me not knowing this obviously would've been really down for it at the time. Till the next time we hung out, we made out like crazy and really felt for each other but nothing led to another. We had fair talks about having sex and she was really down for it and then the next times we hung out she felt like or feared of being used.  Like if those were my intentions, to use her. 

So then I said okay then, it doesn't have to lead to that but we could still be apart of each others lives. So we left it at that and just talked normal and we still had plans to hang out.  Yesterday we out to a park late at night just enjoying the nightlife and she asked to kiss me again and I said that's fine so we did and then she was just feeling apologetic towards me and was expecting me to hate her for it. I told her, I do not mind being friends but if it gets to a point to where you can't even be my friend because you feel like you'll kiss me or feel like you need to retract your feelings, then what's the point of being friends anymore.  She doesn't want anything serious, nor I myself want something like that. But she genuinely confused me and I'm more upset about it than mad.

It's been a couple weeks since then. We've had so much fun talking. We've been out a couple times, got pizza, played pool, went on long ass walks and I showed you my favorite spots in the university. It's been a great ride.

But I do wish that it wasn't a criteria for you to date someone. Well it's either that, or maybe you're just not as interested in me as I'm into you.

Say there is a guy wanting to end a relationship with a toxic woman.

He tells the new girl right away his intentions of breaking off the current relationship. He also says he really wants to see her however he needs to end it with the current gf first. Is this considered cheating? 

My friend is convinced this is considered cheating because he’s talking to someone he is technically interested in. 

I argue it’s not cheating and more of a grey area because he intends on ending the relationship before proceeding further with this new person which, IMO, is the right thing to do.

TL:DR I get an overwhelming sense of guilt just before I go to make the first move even if I know they like me back and I don’t know where it comes from. This has recently completely jeopardized my chances with a woman I would have done anything for

Problem description 
     I have never been able to make the first move when it comes to any form of physical intimacy because it makes me feel like I’m doing something unethical. I have had some light experience with relationships and am very comfortable in my sexual identity but seem to lack the power to engage 

I am a (19m) and I have just recently noticed a strange pattern in my dating life. I essentially don’t have that hard of a time finding a date or even getting asked out on occasion. However I can never seem to make it any further than this. I manage to make it to about the third date most of the time and then things fall off because they think I’m not interested anymore. This is most definitely not the truth but it’s because I have a weird inability to initiate the extra intimacy. I don’t fully understand what the problem is because when I ask them out I’m not overly nervous about rejection. I also love touch it is definitely my love language but I get this felling of extreme guilt right before I ever lean in to kiss her. The thing that really confuses me is that although I have been kissed by 2 women ( I’ve literally never done it first) and really enjoyed it. One of which actually lead to a small relationship. I just can’t seem to do it myself. I’ve talked to a couple of my friends about it and they suggested that it was just because I didn’t have genuine feelings for any of them. And although this explanation does make sense for a couple of the women, this problem recently ruined my chances with a girl (20F) I could see myself dating for years. We meet over the summer and I swear my buddies kept track but we saw each other around 21 times in August alone. And I mean it when I say I was head over heals for this girl, just the purest and strongest emotion I have ever felt for another person. It was obvious that at first it was a one way feeling but it did eventually become mutual. The root of the problem however was that I was going to move hundreds of kilometres away in September for school and she had to stay for hers. But despite my feelings and the best before date looming overhead I couldn’t do anything with it. I’ll spare you the details but we did some really fun and personal things together that gave me ample opportunity to make a move. But long story short I never did. After I moved we stayed in contact and I ended up telling her essentially what I am telling you now. She admitted that she really did want a relationship and for me to make a move and was disappointed that I didn’t. This absolutely gutted me and has been taking a really heavy toll on my mental health and now my self esteem too. Please if you have any wise words or have experienced something similar help a bother out and let me know. I appreciate anything you can offer in guidance both for breaking this strange self restriction and distracting me from spending hours not sleeping thinking what could have been.

Little back story: We march on dating up “bumble” in beginning of September and didn’t have our first date until end of September. It was then when we had many dates and meets and things we did together until one of the big festivals recently we’ve attended which brought us closer. 

Since day ones I’ve noticed something that bothered me when we are out in public (social) place like a restaurant or bar primarily. I feel as if she only wants to go to these places to stare at other guys and girls and it is noticeable like it is not just a quick look, it’s more of a very visible stare with her even turning head 10+ times around. I had a little hint of a conversation about it about a week ago mentioning I love how aware of surroundings she is and I saw that she understood exactly what I meant by that.

As we know we are all looking at negatives in everything as humans, but during this stage of relationship I am trying to obtain trust and whether she is worthy of it as you know of it. When researching on google it seems to me it is a horrible sign and I should already be dumping her as “I am just another person to fill her time while she is looking for next big thing”. 

I know she and I have gotten attached to each other and we meet at least few times a week including spending weekend or day on weekend together.

BUT, this whole looking at other people situation so persistently in social scenes is driving me a bit crazy. I just never met a girl and I dated many (not to brag I just have experience) and see red flags very quickly, but this one is just different and I really like her in many ways. 

Little background on her: She is into rave festivals scene type of girl. She had two 2 year relationships with latest one being with bi guy (I am straight fully if that matters). 

At times really long shot I wonder whether she is promiscuous but she is just not exhibiting some obvious traits and things we talk about are just so close to both of our hearts.


Maybe I’m just over exaggerating this and best solution to just straight up ask her and not to waste both of our times on what exactly is she looking at. It’s just to the point of being uncomfortable for me as I get this stare from other guys like is that guy her boyfriend or a friend and should I approach her (and yes we are very touchy in public as she grabs my arm everywhere we go).

My ex and I had broke up in March and I wanted a hot girl summer before I left for my European adventure. One of the guys (26M) I went out with and I just clicked and dated casually, but intensely for the rest of the summer. When it came time for me to leave, he flew out with me and we spent a whirlwind week and a half in my new city together. We tried to have a talk about what was going to happen with us for the next four months, but I truthfully didn’t want to be tied down by anything and we agreed to just “try.”

Flash forward about a month of me being gone, and lots of great communication and missing each other, and he asked me to be exclusive with him. I agreed happily because I wanted to move forward with him and liked him enough to sacrifice some elements of my European experience to do it.

He then tells me a month later he is buying a plane ticket to come out and visit me for my birthday. I have been swooning. It’s been hard of course being apart for so long, but I have felt so connected to him and have felt like we have actually made so much progress in our relationship already.

Then, the other day, we started talking about how things might be different when I come back and we aren’t distant anymore. I asked him if he could see potential for us for a long-term relationship and his response was, “I can’t make any judgments about our longevity until you get back.” This was pretty crushing to me as I have felt like we have spent months now working towards that and I have given up a lot to do it. I sent him a 10 minute audio message explaining my feelings and how I don’t think we have been on the same page and his response was “thank you for explaining. sorry for the disproportionate response, I don’t want to make anything worse.” I was hoping he would talk to me about his feelings, but it seems like that was his attempt to spare mine. I feel really hurt and stupid.
The kicker? He flies in for my birthday tomorrow morning. I feel so disconnected from him now and am questioning everything, and I don’t know how to go through this weekend not completely miserable.

Hi everyone,

Over a month ago, I (31 W) met this guy (29 M) on an app. We had an enjoyable conversation on the app and decided to go on a date some days later. We had a coffee during the day, and the connection was so great. We were initially were going for drinks later in the night, but as I was in his neighborhood, he wanted to have the coffee, and we still met later in the evening.

&amp;#x200B;

**History of the experience**

The evening date was so magical. We talked about our spirituality, our relationship with the world, and everything between the sun and the earth. It ended up in a scorching kiss, but I told him I had to cut it short as I was leaving for a weekend trip. We texted a couple of times while I was away and decided to meet up on Sunday when I got back. He came and brought the beer I liked, we started watching a movie, it got hot and heavy, and we went all the way. Something in me felt like I had landed in a place I wanted to be, and I could sense he felt the same. In the following weeks, we both were busy with work and other things. We both got sick, so we did not get to meet up for three weeks. On our third date, we decided to go to the Spa and dinner. It was so magical that I was super nervous, but he kept making sure I felt safe, holding hands, kissing me, and taking the lead on the conversation. We went back to mine and got intimate, and he stayed the night, had lunch with me, and left. In between our dates, we did not text as I wanted to give him space between to feel it out and see if he would take the lead.

The following week he (M 29) reached out and came over Saturday night. We went out for drinks, played games, flirted, and went back to my house for an intimate shower, where we both agreed we were connecting. The following morning we stayed in bed, watched movies, and I made us lunch. I did not want to suggest what we should do after as it was better to give space for him to leave if he wished too and I would respect that. He wanted us to go for a walk around the city and have coffee. It ended up being us strolling for hours, kissing, hugging, and holding hands. He was cuddling with me, we were joking and laughing a lot. We later decided to sit down somewhere, and my friend came by, and we had conversations with the people around us at the restaurant. We moved to another place, where he said he wanted to go, and my brain went fast and said, oh, after spending so much time with you, I felt strange about you leaving, but don't freak out it is just because I have had fun, and I know you need space alone as do I. He said it freaked him out a bit, and I assured him. It was not meant like that.

We (M29) (W31) started playing chess, and he (M29) suddenly wanted to play with my friend (W33) in the middle of the game, and I was surprised but told him it was fine then another guy came and asked to play with him. I told him it was ok as we both wanted to go home soon and it would probably be more fun. We were joking and playing as a team. He then wanted to go, and I said I would join as I also needed to go home. While we were standing outside the bar, him talking to one group and me another, he was asked if I was his wife, he said no, his girlfriend, and I said how sweet, but that it was not the case between the two of us, no one heard us speaking.

When we left, he reassured me that he did not think that. I told him (M 29) no worries, we just started meeting, and we were not there to make any decisions, but I liked him(M 29), and I (W 31) guessed he liked me too, he confirmed. But if he wanted to speak his mind, he could do so. He expressed he did not want a relationship and did not see me as being one for him and that the day had made him feel drained. It hurt my feelings, but I told him I understood, but I was open to it, and if the door is closed, it makes it a bit hard to move freely to the unknown. we took a taxi together, and I kept quiet, he kept telling me that there was nothing wrong with me, but he did not want one. I told him I understood and that we were adults and it was fine, and that I respected feelings, and asked if we should cut connections. When we got to min, he got out of the car to hug me and said maybe we could sleep on it. I said, if you know what you feel, it might be better to leave it. I told him I understood and hugged him and left.

He (M29) has not texted me since. My guy friend tells me to text him (M29) and see if he might have been embarrassed and that he might have felt hurt. However, my girlfriend tells me to leave it and never connect with him again. It has been two weeks...

*Nature Human Behaviour (2021)*

&amp;#x200B;

Humans are social animals whose well-being is shaped by the ability to attract and connect with one another, often through brief interactions. In addition to physical features, a choreography of movements, physical reactions and subtle expressions may help promote attraction. Here, we measured the physiological dynamics between pairs of participants during real-life dating interactions outside the laboratory. Participants wore eye-tracking glasses with embedded cameras and devices to measure physiological signals including heart rate and skin conductance. We found that overt signals such as smiles, laughter, eye gaze or the mimicry of those signals were not significantly associated with attraction. Instead, attraction was predicted by synchrony in heart rate and skin conductance between partners, which are covert, unconscious and difficult to regulate. Our findings suggest that interacting partners’ attraction increases and decreases as their subconscious arousal levels rise and fall in synchrony.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1125569,public,self,Interesting - It's ur heart beats that bring u together,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qrhugb/interesting_its_ur_heart_beats_that_bring_u/,no_ads,0,,,,,

So, a few weeks back, I met this girl at a bar. We chatted for a bit, the convo was flowing really well, and I managed to get her snap. 

Honestly, I had a great feeling about her. She was genuinely smiling, and most of the time we got to spend chatting was with her and I alone (her friends and mine dissapeared out of nowhere lol) btw I'm a bit of an introvert, she really made me feel confident about myself and I didn't feel forced to talk to her at any point. She on the other hand, is more open and preety much an extrovert. 

Anyway, next day, I knew after leaving the bar that I wanted to see her so I shoot her a text and she shows interest in seeing me again too which was great, so I setup a date. Couple days later, we meet at this cool restaurant where I got us a table (fancy but didn't look too romantic, I mean... Why play the romantic cards right away if we met in a bar and got to chat for a limited amount of time?) And most importantly I really wanted to get to know her and not force things and see if there was at least room for friendship.

As a result, the date went SOOO WELL. We got to know eachother, talk about literally everything and nothing for 5 HOURS. Time flew with her, but we were having a blast. She even said it mid-date as we saw time flying. Also, I could feel some form of mutual attraction in the date from the way she was looking at me (and the way I was too), there was even some lip biting going back and forth for most of the time. And we laughed quite a lot too that night. And sadly the tables were big AF so we were quite a part, so no physical contact was really made with all that was going on. 

Now comes the moment we say goodbye, sadly I wanna say... No kiss, but we kissed eachother on the cheek saying we'll see eachother soon. Then as she walked up to the bus she turned and gave me a genuinely happy/reassured look. Man I felt so good. I know the old insecure extra-introverted me would've NEVER go as far as I went (even getting her snap lol) 

Now it's my turn to get home, then when I arrive, I see that she sent me a message saying she had a great night and ended by ""hope we can see eachother back soon😘"" 

Made my night twice as good as it was lol. I reply and as she told me she had a busy week I thought I'd send her a message on the week end (a few days later), so I do, she lets me know when she's available, I suggest a good time where we could see eachother, then she leaves me on read for almost a week. I ask her if we should do this another time, while in the meantime not overthinking things and saying to myself like ""is she ghosting me or wtf? What have I done wrong?"" 

I mean ghosting would completely contradict what has seem to come out of the first date, if that makes sense.

Anyway, she gets back, and we end up agreeing on seeing eachother on the following Saturday (like 2 days later). I suggest a date idea, bowling and a cool place I know she'll enjoy, then nothing but a ""read"" Until sunday where she says sorry for not getting back and tells me she was partying all week end and she accidentally slept all day on Saturday. I tell her we'll take the week to get properly organized for the next date. 

We get to talk a little bit on snap the following days. Then the time comes for me to, (for the last time) set up our date. I tell her a date and a time but sadly she can't and she tells me when she's available and I see that we have a day off in common so I tell her ""Friday works perfect for me as well. My offer from last week end still stands, you never told me if that sounded good to you (oh yeah because I asked her in case bowling wasn't her thing)"" Then got a response back 2 or 3 days later saying she won't be available again. 

Idk, for as long as I have her snap and for as long as she doesn't say that she's not interested anymore, I don't see why I should be dropping the towel, because she seems to be showing a ""minimum"" of interest by suggesting other days we could see eachother and not straight up saying ""no I can't see you this week ."" Or ""I don't want to see you anymore"". By the way she suggested other possibilities of seeing eachother the next week, but she's preety much saying that every time. 

This time what I did, I left things on her to tell me when she'd be interested in seeing eachother. I told her the days I was available, so I guess it's her turn to tell me what day she wants to see me. If she says something it's cool, but if she doesn't I feel like I'll have to take it as a pass. I mean.. It's almost going to be a month since we had the first date and since she started pushing things back every week. 

At the same time I don't want to invest too much of my personal time on one person IF barley no effort is spent on her end to see eachother like she said she wanted to, but I also think about how good was the first date and how good the next one MIGHT be? 

So yeah I'm quite confused about all of that.

Hello guys!

22M here, who dated this girl like 5 years ago but as you can imagine we were too young and that time I was really depressed that it didn't escalate towards a real relationship but now I am greatful that we met again. We went on a date and it was like never before, you know you can just enjoy your true self without worrying about the other get concerned because she is basically the same.

It feels like we continued where we left.

So after the date something clicked in me and I just can't resist chatting with her, sometimes I feel like I am too much.

How do you know that you are going over the line? How do you stop yourself of chatting all day? I am afraid it might have a negative effect on us and our ""relationship""

There is this girl at university that I fell in love with, unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. But I already knew from the first meeting that she was the one.  
I confessed my feelings to her and told her that I hope for more than friendship. What can I say, I still can't believe it myself: She feels the same way ...

She wanted to make it clear to me that she chose her boyfriend. But I knew that this was your lie and I also told her that, which she confirmed without much fighting. She also said things against her relationship with her boyfriend. She said she wished she hadn't met him so that it wouldn't be so hard with us and that if the time hadn't played against us, she would surely be with me today.  
We are left with nothing because she obviously doesn't know what she wants. But I think what she's doing to her boyfriend is wrong, he doesn't know anything about it yet.

TL;DR: I want to establish online/phone communication with a girl I like -- to continue communicating with her after class ends (very soon). She hasn't responded to my Facebook friend request. On the chance that she doesn't check her Facebook. How do I proceed?

I (M25) like a girl (F21) in my class. I was able to strike up a 20-minute conversation with her. In the next class, her friend asked me for my number. I was able to save the situation by asking her to place all of us in a group chat -- on Facebook Messenger. I was able to use a class assignment as an excuse to create a Zoom meeting with the girl I like and a few others in the group; the Zoom meeting went well. Our class is ending very soon and I want to establish a connection with her on social media and etcetera before I may never see her again. The next day I decide to add the girl I like on Facebook -- since we're only connected on the group Messenger chat. It's been a day since I've sent the friend request and she hasn't added me back and now I'm wondering what my next move is?

Should I wait until I see her in person again to ask her for her number or Instagram (which is awkward since we are already technically connected on Messenger)?

Should I send her a direct message on Facebook Messenger and talk about some random school stuff?

That city is 700km away from mine. 

We hit it off immensely and got physical the second time we saw one another. I travelled once more to that city, and spent one night with him. 

We texted a lot in between, and talked to each other once or twice every week. We had so much in common. He appeared to be very interested in me - my vibe, my background, my work, my physical features, everything. It also went both ways. He had said multiple times that he will definitely come visit me in my city whenever he gets a break from work.

Last week he texted my saying he misses me and wishes he could see me. I told him that well, that’s fortunate, because I’m visiting a city 300km away from his in the following week and he can come catch me there on the weekend. He got pretty excited and told me that he couldn’t wait. 

Flash forward to two nights ago. He texted me saying that he wouldn’t come because he’s “working too much”, “needs some rest”, “it would be too much effort for something that wouldn’t last long anyway”. Even though we never officially dated or were serious in anyway, this kinda hurt. Did he *just* remember that he finds driving to be a hassle when he’d told me 100 times he wants to see me in a city a lot farther than this one? Did it *just* occur to him that he’s not willing to put in effort for something that wouldn’t last? I feel rejected and frankly, a little stupid for that I was excited to see him. 

Yeah so, that’s all that went down. I didn’t have that many people to tell about this, so I kinda needed to get it off my chest.

However, the repetition aspect of social interaction is often what’s emphasized, not the ‘warm-up’ or preparation. It’s often encouraged to approach women with a certain line or faked energy, even if one’s confidence or mental state is less than ideal. The thought is that confidence and success will come from purely from repetition, after the initial fear of rejection has been met. However, this leads to endless approaches with the same result; guys often wonder when the confidence will eventually come, but what they don’t realize is that an initial insecure or negative self-perception sets the baseline for negative interactions.

When you go to the gym, play a sport, or physically compete with others, do you just run in without any preparation? Of course not—you stretch, you mentally outline how you’re going to approach things, you warm up. The same approach needs to be taken before you interact with a strangers, particularly women. They are highly perceptive to the energy you convey, which is determined by your state of mind. ‘Fake it to you make it’ does not work for long until the facade fades.

When you are interacting with a woman in public, your energy is far more critical than any line. How you feel is more important than what you say. You can have the best line on the world, but if you are unconfident, feel like you are bothering her, or outcome dependent, you will most likely fail.

Before going out and interacting with others, briefly visualize moments in your life that have made you feel the following ways. If you don’t have experiences to draw from, visualize a scenario where you would feel this way, an idealized version of yourself. Spend 30 seconds to a minute thinking of each scenario.

You are interesting. Think of what you do that makes you interesting or unique. Your passions, your hobbies, your knowledge or experiences. Get to the point that you feel like anyone you interact with will have

You are fun and whimsical. Think of ways that you irreverent and self/amusing, how you don’t take the opinions of others seriously. This is critical. You want to always interact with women with a genuine sense of fun and not taking the interaction too seriously, that you’re afraid of rejection.

You are attractive. Recall a few particularly positive interactions or compliments you received form women that really stood out and made you feel confident. Really get in tune with how it made you feel in the moment. I have had a couple of women tell me that they appreciate how masculine, yet fun and kind I was at the same time. Those really struck a chord with me, and what I reference mentally. If you don’t have these type of experiences, visualize what you would like women to say to you or treat you if you are the most attractive version of yourself. It might be difficult at first, but take a moment.

You might have other ways of getting yourself in the proper mental state, but always cultivate your self perception. Instead of worrying about bothering someone, you will view the interaction form the perspective that you are giving someone an experience they won’t have with anyone else.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1125604,public,self,Men’s advice.

Last December I went on 3 days with someone, let’s call her C. Two video calls, one in-person date. The last date went hours later than she planned to be there because we were having such a good time, but then a few hours after it ended she sent me a very ambiguous text about maybe just being friends. Maybe a stupid part on my move but I asked a clarifying question about if she was saying she wanted to go on one more date to figure out her feelings or if she wanted to end things there. Well she ended up exploding on me, saying I need to learn to take no for an answer (note - we didn’t even touch during the date), and then blocked me on all social media. Whatever, I moved on.

In March, she texted me out of the blue apologizing for ending things so quickly and in the way that she did. That I didn’t deserve that. She asked if I wanted to talk as friends, I accepted the apology and apologized for anything wrong that I may have done and then we agreed to talk that weekend. Weekend comes and… nothing. I text her Sunday evening asking if she still wants to chat… and then I get blocked again. Whatever.

Well in September all of a sudden she shows up as a suggested person on Instagram (we didn’t share handles so she didn’t block me there).

We met at work. She asked me out. It's the first relationship for her, whereas, I've been in both serious and casual relationships.

Things between us are great. We flirt, we talk, we meet frequently and got a great sexual chemistry too. However, one thing which has happened a few times is ""whenever she's in trouble, she puts the blame on me as a get out of jail free card"".

To give you a context, she comes from a conservative family. While her parents know about us dating, they don't like us meeting too often (once a week max). Her parents also don't like her going out (they prefer us meeting at her home).

Both girlfriend and me prefer meeting a bit more and going out. So one time, we hadn't met for a while, and I mentioned ""I feel like meeting you"". She was home alone and invited me. Before I reached, her mom came. While walking up to her stairs, I could see gf and her mom talking. Her mom asked ""Why did you have to call him today"". GF said something along the lines of ""He wanted to meet and I couldn't say no (it was more like he forced to meet""

I heard that and was upset. Gf told me later she had to do it ""to make an excuse to her mother"".

A couple days back, we talked on call. It was after a few days, so we talked right till 4 in the morning. It was me who had to end the call saying ""Got work tomorrow. We should sleep"". We also had a fight during the call.

The next day, I went to meet her and while things were great and fun between us, I noticed a text on her phone (she gave me her phone to show something on WhatsApp). She had told one of her closest family members (who she shares everything with), that she felt sleepy whole day because ""I"" bugged her to talk and hence she couldn't sleep. 

Her relative replied somewhere along the lines of ""Sleep is important. Switch off your phone if he forces you to talk during sleep""

Now I didn't tell gf that I read it but it pissed me off. Anytime gf is at trouble, she easily makes me out to be the bad guy. She doesn't actually think I'm the bad guy because she stil keeps calling me at night to talk but she pushes me under the bus so easily that I'm worried if her conservative parents know we got physical, she might even accuse me of forcing her?

I know it sounds exaggerated but I don't know what's the best way to confront gf. Since part of the reason I got to know it was due to ""reading message which I wasn't supposed to""

And the thing is I don't really think i'm a bad looking guy, I also don't think I am an introvert or can't speak openly with people. I was back then (for the social skill part) but in recent times I became better and better and people who meet me nowadays for the first time even refer to me as an extrovert (which is a huge compliment for me)

But still it didnt work out for me at least for now and that makes me very sad. I'm 26 btw and maybe thats why I feel under pressure or ashamed. I don't even think I'm not confident or whatever. I just got recently rejected by a woman I really really liked and thought we were a good fit.

I’m in my 40’s. While I had a very rough life, I’m a stable person. I’ve been through a lot of trauma, I surely have scars, but I’m stable, raising a child with a career, social life, all that stuff. 

I was very triggered finding out this information. I am happy he was honest. But I got literally scared. I do like him, and I am an empathetic person who doesn’t want to walk away because of his illness. Most would say “run” as it is early on. I don’t think that is the right thing to do.

I am afraid though. Having a mother with that disease was traumatizing. 

My plan is to have a talk with him explaining my experience with a mother with the same Illness and to lay down what I will and will not tolerate from this illness. Because the ones you love are often the targets, never ever the outside world .

A couple days pass by snd I ask her what she wants snd she said she doesn’t want something strictly casual and that a FWB would be something she would be interested in but she would want to set boundaries.

She said she was busy this weekend with work, but next week I said we should talk it out and set expectations, she wanted us to get STD tested too(something I’ve never done lol), and ya. I’m just concerned about catching feelings bc this was my highshcool crush and at first I couldn’t believe that I was doing this with my high school crush, but I think I still see her as the old version of her and I’m now seeing this new version.

Like she used to have like such feminine characteristics and have beautiful long hair, wear cute clothes, she seemed so gentle, and now she’s more into of a punk aesthetic, she shaved her head, wears a lot of black, and like I wouldn’t like this girl if I didn’t know the old her. She was like more of a sunshine and now she’s like rocky and grungy.

This is all to say that I don’t know if I even like her either, so I feel like she wants to test out the waters without commitment or like being tied down, but I guess we’ll talk about it in person. 

I’ve been wanting someone to experiment sexually as well and I guess it would be cool to have with someone who I’ve known and seems to be open as well.

He hasn’t really ever given me a reason not to trust him. I do know that because of my OCD spirals there’s some things he won’t tell me because he doesn’t want to trigger me or cause me stress. 

Now to get to the question. We’ve been together for almost 4 years! I was raised in church all my life so i made the decision to not have sex (intercourse) until I was married. My fiancé has known this from the very beginning and is fine with it! Recently (&amp; I’ve been known this) he was watching porn (no biggie); however, I found a picture of a porn star in his phone and I went into a spiral because of that. So we decided that he wouldn’t watch porn anymore. He also said that he didn’t want to watch it because he didn’t want it to affect his sexual performance. I can tell he hasn’t been watching it (either at all or not as much ) because he’s always on me, constantly touching me and wanting to do sexual things, which I like.

Today, I had his phone and went through his email (I was looking for an email from one of our friends) so I looked in the spam email section and saw some spam emails saying stuff like “I’ll suck you off” and things
Of that nature. So I questioned him about it and he was like “they’re spam, I have not watched porn.” But like how did they get his email?

Typically I will go on one or two dates per year via a dating app (which already seems a bit low) and if I like the woman I will follow up the next day only to receive from her the dreaded “there wasn’t any chemistry” or “I didn’t feel any sparks” text. When it comes to self-questioning, bringing up the typical speculation of “are the pictures on your profile honest?” or “do you smell?” or “do you talk too much?” doesn’t really help me, because those are questions I’ve already examined before and with honest friends too. Some of this may be in part because of the way online dating works, where many people expect intense and immediate sparks upon meeting a stranger and move on if it’s not present because they know the next date is just a swipe away. On the other hand, if I’ve been chronically single for so long there are probably factors of my own at play.

This leads me to wonder if an individualized approach would be better for empirically discovering what the actual problem is rather than asking for yet more speculation from strangers.
