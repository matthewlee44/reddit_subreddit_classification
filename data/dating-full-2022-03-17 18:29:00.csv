I sat down by myself on the couch as Jack got it for me. He gave it to me, and I had a couple of sips. Jack sat down so close that our butts were nearly touching. He put his hand around my waist.

John got mad and said he couldn't hook up with me because he liked me. The next day, everyone told me what John said.

I asked John if that was true that he liked me. He denied it, and said that he had a girlfriend, and that everyone else must've bought it up a joke. I told everyone what he said, and they were shocked. They had no idea that he had a girlfriend. He never brought her up.

I was wondering when it is appropriate/ inappropriate to approach women? 

So here's the situation when I was in university, I had no issues approaching women who I never met before that I thought were cute and managed to get some of their numbers. When I did this, I always made sure to assess their body language to see if they may be open to a conversation and kept the interaction light hearted and always made sure I did it either in a public place during the day or when they were around a group of friends so they would feel safe. 

The thing is I'm out of university now and I feel like at school, it was slightly more appropriate to do that but IDK how women will react to this in public like on the street, at the gym or even a shopping mall. Even though I feel like I do not do so and make sure I take steps to prevent this, the last thing I want is make a woman feel uncomfortable or even unsafe and not enjoy the interaction.   

I definitely do not feel comfortable talking to a woman on the street alone at night or even at their place of work (especially waitresses) because I feel like their place of work is a place they want to feel safe.

Option #1: Online Dating
Option #2 Dating in College

Option #2 would normally be okay. However... everyone in college now is 18-19 and I'm going to be 26. So doesn't really work out going back to school later in life to be dating students.

Option #1 is great if you are successful. Putting down that you're a 26 year old with no job, income, and living with parents is not exactly attractive.

And for now, I feel extremely happy and inspired from communication with him. Both me and him are independent people, doing pretty good, evolving our careers. Obviously, due to his age he has achieved more but there is no disproportion. I have broken up from my long relationship 6 months ago and I wasn’t dating anybody, maybe extremely casual encounters.

Our conversation goes with the flow, we can spend a lot of time together without being bored (and it’s not a frequent case for me), our sex is really one of the best I’ve had (and I had it with quite a few people different ages and experiences). It’s not even so much about sex itself, as about intimacy level and chemistry. We can be just cuddling and kissing and giving each other the most intimate time not in a sexual way. At least for me it feels extremely special even though it’s far from my first relationship. 

However, I totally understand that no matter how good we feel now, if it proceeds anywhere further, it might have a lot of difficulties and maybe it doesn’t even have prospective for such future as family and etc. Even in my own thinking, I’d never feel that I could develop genuine feelings for someone 14 years older than me.

Everyone got a little to drunk and we ended up kissing a little. I didn’t really recall the incident and didn’t think anything of it until he added me on snap and apologized for the situation being slightly awkward. Afterwards he kept starting conversations about everything and anything (ranging from his cat and curtains to parties and food) like 2-4 a week, and me not being so interested back then I just responded, but never started any of my own, he kept it going. We did this for about 3 months. 

The weird thing was that we act like we barely know each other when we run in to each other while going out. I of course is also to blame, but it’s weird and I have never been in a similar situation before. 

I started to become more interested the last month, but the fact the we didn’t progress the relationship at all except for slightly deeper conversations bothered me. He’s a “shy” nerdy guy, we’re both studying physics and out mutual friends who knows about the situation keeps pushing that he’s to shy and that I’m gonna have to make the next move if I want anything to happen. 

Normally I don’t ask guys out, but after completely ignoring eacother in a group setting an entire night out I felt fed up, and even just for the sake of a potential friendship, since we have many friend in common, I asked if he wanted to hangout after exams. He said yes, but didn’t seem very excited about it. 

After I asked him he is acting different. WAY slower replies and not a single conversation started by him since. In my mind, he must have at least wanted to be friend since he kept talking to me, and friends meet in real life, so I’m really confused about this reaction. I actually thought he liked me, or I wouldn’t have asked him. What does this mean, did he just say yes because he felt saying no would be rude or something?

Hello, I'm (29) and this is my story.

I just have a feel to share some thoughts this evening. It's spring, love is in the air and I have those rare days when I question myself why I'm still single. That tiny little saddenes somewhere in the back of your heart. It's funny that you understand how silly and stupid it is, but still hard to handle it. 

My last relationship had a very bad break up. It was a divorce and after that I couldn't be with someone. It made me question in what I believe, how things work and who I am. I'm kinda ""old fashioned"", if I choosed someone I thought It's a forever. My ex was almost immediately seeing someone and after a year got married again, and I'm super happy for them. For me I understood what it's like to be [really] alone and explore my true values, my shadow side and... tried rise from the ashes. 

I never had a problem to date someone and start a relationship. I don't want to label, but for a faster understanding for what kind of creature I'm an INFP, Sagittarius; dreamy, adventures, goofy, fun. I'll be open for a conversation and spontaneous adventures,  love to learn, do things together, people feel super comfortable with me and that crated falls hope. I'm just open, but that can be seen as flirty. 
Now I just go to work and don't stuff like that (go walk alone mostly), just to avoid unnecessary broken hearts. I'm ready to try, I just understand fast that with most people I'm kinda the clown and I don't want to be in this in solo. 

Till 25 I was ready to explore. For example, distance never scared me. I'll wait, find time for calls (talk till 4 am and wake up in 3 hours to get ready for work, for several months) and even traveled by myself to the boy, paid for everything too (I was raised that men pay, but I had to explore in person does it work for me). Age difference? Pff. Different areas of interest? Whatever, teach me and I'll share with you, let's combine and do projects together. Nothing was a problem. Arguing? Let's talk! Just anything, but [together]. 

Now at the age of almost 30 I understand fast with who I'm dealing with and just don't go even for a coffee. But! There were some cool people I've met, unfortunately it was only a 90% match. I didn't like some moments,   some fundamental values. I got to know myself better and now I don't close my eye on such things anymore. Basics values should match. 

I really want to fall in love and have the right energy exchange. I'll meet nice men, double excited if they are artistic and creating always something, but when I get to know them better they were kinda gay. I don't care what people do, not judging, it's just not the right energy. I'd rather question myself why I attracted such a person, it's not their fault, maybe I'm not feminine enough.

I’m 27 (f) and I’ve been single for a few months. I’ve been dating here and there. Mostly bad experiences until recently.

I met this 24 yo guy and I’ll call him Blaire (found on a dating app), and we had an amazing first date. We clicked and had a great time. So the next morning comes (yes, he spent the night), and we are going to brunch. On the way,a number keeps texting him (probably six messages in a row?). Without me asking, he offers up that it’s a buddy from work keeps texting him because he usually has questions pertaining to work. I just said oh ok, and we continued talking about something else…fast forward a couple of days.

I have him on Facebook, and I was looking his profile. I was looking because I missed him. I look down and one of his friends was the same name that was texting him that morning. It was a girl!! I connected some dots from previous conversations, and it’s a girl he had dated recently. 

So he outright lied about who was talking to. I was outright furious. I hate being lied to, and it’s a huge trigger. I’m a very transparent person even when it makes people uncomfortable. Before anyone asks, I don’t care that he was talking/dating other people. I honestly expect it especially after only one date. 

My reaction was not great, and I’m not quite proud of it. First, we had scheduled a second date and I told him not to come. Then I called him an “f-ing liar”. 
Then I messaged the girl and told her who I was, and told him the story about how she was a “co-worker”. In my mind, I messaged her, because I don’t want her to be getting played and she needs to know also that he lied. Blaire called and texted me a few times after sending him those messages. I waited about an hour for the girl to message me back on FB but she never did. At that point, I had calmed down and called Blaire back. 
What it boils down to is he made a stupid lie, because he didn’t want me to get upset for talking to another girl.  
Dumb answer. 

Also, I unsent that message to the girl (it was Facebook). I did this because according to him she was very into him and it wasn’t mutual. I did it to possibly spare her feeling if he was telling the truth.

So I'm 22 about to graduate undergrad and am looking to go to grad school. I'm fairly shy and introverted but I'm beginning to be more social and less shy and just coming out of my shell in general. Right now I've just been working on improving myself, and I have a small social circle of friends I talk to but it still needs work. I've been working on just talking to more people in general and not just women. I'd also say I'm fairly confident in who I am as a person, but when it comes to dating women or talking to them, it hesitates me a little. I've only ""dated"" 1 person in my life and it ended pretty bad since she ghosted me. I've moved on from it, but recently it dawned on me that I am super inexperienced. I've never kissed or had sex and there is a part of me that is somewhat fearful of what will happen if I get with someone my age, and they find all this out. Like a while back, I was in my school library and I overheard this conversation and this girl was telling her friends how this guy was  bad kisser, and I thought to myself ""Shit. is that going to be me when I have my first kiss? or lose my virginity?"" I often try not to think or dwell about stuff like this and focus on my positive aspects like how people say I am fun at parties or am very funny and make them laugh. However, once in a blue moon I let my mind drift into the shadow realm and let negative thoughts dwell for a little and this is one of them.

After that date, she told me that she was in a bit of a tough spot after a fairly fresh breakup so I decided to slow things down and give her some space.  


We did keep talking and after a few weeks we went on two subsequent dates that were both enjoyable. I still kept it pretty casual as to not make her feel uneasy or anything but I feel like we were bonding nonetheless.  


After that third date, we talked for a while, like usual, but now it's been a while since I haven't really heard anything from her.

  
Thing is, she rarely initiates any conversations but always engages, so right now I'm feeling a bit uneasy myself. I really like her but I feel like after all this time, still being the one to initiate things is a bit rough and it makes me question the direction things were going.

They said they had been to a lot of the artist we were seeing concerts. This was my then wifes' and my second, all were pretty excited. We all added each other on a social media website and became friends. About 8 months in May my then wife and I split and I moved from Kentucky to Maine. Once up there I had made a decent life for myself, had to refile for divorce after moving up there cause the exwife to be had moved to Texas and lost the divorce papers. 

Meanwhile the youngest of the daughters was too getting a divorce. I didn't know it as we kind of lost touch as there was a new social media platform beginning so I requested to add her on there. She agreed. Soon we were texting and calling each other everyday. Jobs at that point in Maine were becoming scarce. I asked her about the job market where she lived, she said there was a decent job market where she lived in Indiana. I asked her what she thought about having a relationship just out of the blue. She said I'd have to move down there as she was not moving up there so I agreed and we started 1 long distance and I started packing my things and I moved from Maine to Indiana that next month in July. Lady J as I will call her picked me up at the bus drop off and I remet her Mom before going to the place I would eventually move into. Lady J and I were spending all our free time together. 

We would later spread apart after being together nearly 5 years, I wanted to ask her the next step but never did cause she didn't want that ""ring"" again but didn't mind to be dating forever. 

So here I went about my life without her and she without me, we agreed maybe later if the time was right we might try again. So flash forward to 2022 still living in the town I moved to in 2010 and out of the blue I had a dream about Lady J. So I sent her a message and she too had had a dream about me, so we reconnected and started again. It was like we were never apart. Nearly a month in now but I feel like we are too different than we were before.

While he doesn't mind initiating things at all he said that some times he just wants me to take control and make decisions. He wants me to initiate a kiss or decided we're going here for dinner. Because sometimes me not doing that makes him feel like I don't want too. 

Which I understand. I really do get it. And I WANT to initiate more. Like it's always something I had said I wanted to do. But... I kinda get halted by 2 things (I think- this is self analysis)

1. When I think about initiating or doing nice things for him my brain doesn't go 'take control and make a decision'. It tells me that that is selfish and what if he doesn't want that (which is ridiculous cause I know he does). Instead it goes ask him what he wants to do, what he wants to eat and then make a decision based on his answer.

I didn't realise how hard it would be to tell my brain that taking control or initiating isn't selfish because it's literally what he's asking me to do... I'm struggling to shake it though.


2. Insecurities... Well yep. Kind of explains itself but there's always apart of me that goes 'what if he doesn't want that.' He is so thoughtful and goes out of his way for me all the time. I just want to do the same for him but I'm terrified that he won't like it.


Logically I know that taking control is what he wants (what I want) and will help it out a lot. But I'm really struggling with the mental side.

He had a horrible break up with a girl 2 years ago.  I'm older than him which complicates things as I found out that he had a horrible relationship with his father. Why I think he's looking beyond sex is that on our second date, we did NOT have sex (we had sex on our 1st date and it was amazing!!!). Our second date was him sharing with me his life and he confessed some really heavy things. I listened and empathized.  Between dates 1 and 2, he took a hot girl out on a date which kinda hurt but I didn't show it.  This will be the first date where he hasn't slept over. He's taking a break from work and going back after dinner. We text everyday. His life is kind of dysfunctional as he has a job that he's really not qualified for both in age and experience. I don't think it's going to end well but I didn't say anything. We have plans for adventures outside. He hasn't said it and to be honest, his actions toward me are more honourable than any gay date I've ever had. For example, the guys I have dated in the past ever slept over after sex initially. He stays and we spend the entire next day together until he goes to work.  I'm a fatalist and fear that I'm an ""experience"" and he doesn't see a long term future with a guy but I could be wrong.  My friends tell me bi men usually have sex with men but settle down with women.  I'm hoping this is not the case as I really like him. I am hoping that with time he can see a future with me. Why I see positive signs in him is because when we met, he told me on our first day that he doesn't kiss men. Then on our second date (he was drunk) he kissed me.

It’s really sad to think back on some of this stuff, because I was naive and lacked self-awareness. Some of the more unsavoury people I “dated” took full advantage of my insecurities, and ran with it - which resulted in some fairly traumatic stuff happening.

I’ve been on and off for years, for the most part I usually preferred the guy to make the first move. I wasn’t liking results &amp; moved over to bumble, that was just as bad. I’m going to be 30, the dating pool is shrinking and guys are going to want younger women. Mind you I was 23, a little thinner (same weight today but lost some muscle mass) and still didn’t get hit on. I just don’t get how people get into relationships so easily. On the dating apps I get matches and msgs but it dies out quickly, ghosting just doesn’t go well. I need the apps because I don’t get hit on in person or don’t have a social life. I go thru periods where I’m content with my singleness then have to ask myself what’s so wrong with me. I feel capable of finding a guy I’d wanna date but it just hasn’t happened.

He’s 28, and I’m 24. We went on a lovely date, he was such a gentleman and the connection was just out of this world. He told me during the date he had previously been engaged to a girl but they broke up a year ago. 

I said ok and proceeded to enjoy the date. A few more dates happened within that week and I was so over the moon. I was convinced this was the one (as early as it may sound). We laughed, hanged out and things were good. He decided for our fourth date (1 week and 4 days since meeting) we should go away together for a city break in Europe. I said yes because it seemed like an adventure. 

The holiday was lovely, and I think I fell for him even more. During the trip he did however mention that his ex had previously became pregnant with twins. She unfortunately had a miscarriage, and things kinda got pretty bad between them afterwards. They tried counselling etc but nothing worked, so they broke up amicably. He said he was telling me this so he didn’t have anything to hide from me. He informed me they are still in touch but just to talk about the ‘cat’ they used to have which lives with her. 

I again brushed this off. 

 Come Monday, he tells me, “oh my ex asked why she hadn’t heard from my all weekend. She asked if I was seeing someone. I told her I’m seeing you and she’s very angry”. 

Now I didn’t understand why she would be angry if they were broken up. I took a day to think about it and on Tuesday I told him I wasn’t comfortable with the situation and he needed to cut all ties. 

He then proceeds to make excuses to say ‘she’s never been like this’. Then he said he would deal with it, because he feels really good about us. He then said their situation is temporary cause he helped her our financially while at uni. Essentially this man paid her school fees and i wouldn’t be surprised if he’s financing her now. I was not happy.

Come today, this girl has tried to add me on all social media accounts and she messaged says ‘I really need to speak to you. I have some questions’. 

I ignored and told him. He said I should ‘block &amp; ignore and she won’t annoy you anymore’. That’s all he’s said to me today.

I confronted him about it, and he just stopped talking to me. We stopped talking for 2 days. Thought I should just give him space.  2 nights ago I decided to message him if it was over.

For the basic rundown, we're both 18F, and have known each other for around a year and a half maybe? The two of us recently turned 18 (our birthdays are just 6 days apart), and we've gotten closer and closer as friends, to the point where I'd probably say I know her the best out of anyone out of our friend group. We're also both one of the few transgender students in our school, which gives us a common ground to talk.

he's had a few relationships in the past, but my situation's a little different. The most I've ever had was a brief time e-dating when I was 15, so I can't exactly say I'm experienced. After I first met her, I gradually formed a crush, though that was put to a halt once she got a girlfriend. Regardless, our friendship continued to grow, and I can't fully say my crush went away. This New Years, she'd discovered that she was being cheated on, and needless to say they broke up. I felt kind of guilty, but my feelings came back in full force after that.

We both have very similar interests and passions. I've just never felt the same way whenever I'm with someone. Every time I'm with her I feel both infinitely comfortable, and completely flustered at once, but I feel like that's where I belong. I've had passing crushes on friends before, but it's very clear this is different.

Early February is about when I'd say we got really close. During group hangouts we began briefly cuddling, and this eventually snowballed to me coming over to her room, watching a couple of movies and just cuddling the whole time. This would happen a couple more times and it just felt. nice. We never kissed, but we both seemed real happy with the time we spent together and it felt like a proper relationship was forming. She’s called them “friend dates” to the rest of our friend group before, but sort of hesitated when she did (this is likely just my brain looking way too into things)

Valentines day came around and I invited her over to my house, though anxiety took over and I didn't quite phrase it like I was asking her out. Near-ish the end of February I finally asked “what is our relationship?”, but again the way I phrased it I don't know if it came off that I was interested. Her response was;

""going to be honest i have no fucking clue, we have been getting closer then before and its nice to get physical affection. i try to avoid dating in friend groups so this is a funky thing we got going on like i want you to know that im interested in you but i don't know if i can go further then good friends cuz shit i don't want to lose you over some stupid break up. words hard”

and after a short back and forth,

“how about we chill as friends for know and see what happens in the future""

I agreed and was fully content with that. The way her last relationship ended, I could most certainly see why she was afraid of dating in a friend group. She's also expressed that the friend group we're in is the only one that's ever felt like a home. Quite frankly I wanted to take it as her friend zoning me just so I could get a definitive answer, but she's a sorta blunt, and would've outright said if she wasn't interested.

The thing is, is that we have gotten closer and my feelings are stronger then ever. Just about everyday we'll sit in a Discord vc after school for hours, most hangouts we'll cuddle, every lunch we'll sit right next to each other. I just don't know what to do with my feelings.

Recently its felt like I physically can't stop thinking about her, to the point where I'm concerned for myself- it feels almost like an obsession. In the near future I was planning to just outright go up to her (or more likely message her), and say that I had feelings for her, but was completely content with staying friends, and didn't want to lose what he have.

Now though, she tells me that she got a date on Tinder, and I just feel lost. I'm still happy hanging out with her but I just don't know what to do, it feels like I missed my shot to say anything. I want us both to be happy, so I don't want to stop her from dating anyone else. I also most certainly don't want to ruin our friendship or make things weird between us. Its just a wacky situation and I've got no clue what the solution is.

**TLDR:** I've gotten real close to the person I would consider my best friend, and have fallen in love with her. I don't know to what extent she's interested in me, and now she's got a date on tinder.
