7,ocp7jb,1625279498,Why can't I find a man?,"((This is going to be a long one))

I'm a 25 y/o female and most of my life I've always just wanted to get married and have a family. I'm a romantic at heart and can't really help it. 

I got out of a 1 and a half year relationship with a guy that I believed was the one I was gonna end up with. The relationship was dreadful though and we just weren't getting along. That was probably one of the hardest relationships to try and move on from for me. 

Fast forward 8 months and I've gone on a couple of dates since me and my ex broke up, pretty much only from guys I've met on tinder or bumble, but nothing really came of it. I just wasn't really attracted to them for one reason or another. I would much rather meet somebody organically (in person) but these days that's kind of hard. Most of my past relationships haven't been that good either so it's tough to have a good outlook on relationships for me. 

But then two days ago, I matched with a guy on tinder who was the same age as me (25) and he just caught my eye because he seemed to have a sense of humor and I was attracted to him. He could hold a conversation and we just seemed to get along well. One issue I kind of had was that he liked to do psychedelics often he said and that's not really something I'm into, but I was willing to accept it I suppose since he just made me feel happy, which is something I haven't felt with someone in a long time. He honestly wasn't even really my type, but I just figured I'd take a chance and go for it. 
Right of the bat though, he told me he wasn't looking for hookups but he also wasn't looking for something serious, he just moved into the city from another state and wanted to get to know people here who weren't his roommates. He moved here from LA since he likes to make music and more importantly be an actor or producer. He has been living here about 6 months and I guess the production thing he had moved here for just fell through and he didn't have a job anymore. He said he wasn't too concerned though because he's pretty lucky and things just always work out for him. Deep down I just want someone to settle down with and I guess I was just hoping if he liked me the way I liked him he would want to date and maybe just want to see where things go. I wasn't thinking too much into it tbh, I just knew I liked him.

We only hung out once and he came to my apartment (I know not very safe) and right off the bat I just thought he was the cutest boy ever and had the most amazing smile. He had only been in my apartment for about 30 mins when he said it was really hot in the apartment and so he just took his hoodie off and he was completely shirtless. I thought it was super strange because I just met him and he's shirtless on my couch. I made it kind of obvious I was not comfortable with him being shirtless and he just kind of acted like it wasn't weird so finally I just let it go and he kept his shirt off. We cuddled and he asked to kiss me eventually and it was super super hot. Like I was very attracted to him and he seemed to be very attracted to me by all the moves he was making. 

I made a comment about him possibly wanting to hook up and asking if that was the case since I was a little worried about it and he said that's not what he came here for and that he didn't even bring condoms. I just said okay and hoped I didn't offend him by asking and he said no that it was a fair assumption to make. Anyways, that's pretty much how the whole night went, we just cuddled and talked. I told him that I don't really like to date guys that aren't from my state because they usually aren't here for long. I had a lot distance relationship with a guy from Texas a few years ago and it was hard so that was the main reason. I'm dumb and I didn't think he would look so much into that statement but immediately I could tell his whole attitude changed and he said that it was late and he should go. So when he left I didn't hear from him for like two days and so finally I texted him and asked if he just didn't like me or what happened. He said he was sorry and didn't mean to ghost me but he just felt I was looking for something long term and he didn't even know if he was going to be here long. He said I just really seemed like I was looking for something serious and I knew what I wanted so he thought it best to just not see each other anymore because he didn't want to waste my time. 

I didn't blame him for that since he did say he didn't want anything serious right off the bat, but I was still very hurt he pretty much did ghost me. I feel so miserable right now because of how much I liked him and I just feel so upset that I felt we had such a good connection and chemistry but he just didn't want anything serious with me and that even the thought of it scared him away SO FAST. Im also upset he said he didn't want to hook up but can't help but feel that is what he wanted. Please tell me if you guys think he wanted to just hook up or not. 

Anyways, considering I hadn't felt that way about somebody in a long time and he just ghosted me and then finally told me he didn't want to see me anymore I just can't help but feel done with dating. I feel emotionally exhausted from trying to meet someone and this just made me feel so defeated and I'm interested to know why I'm having such bad luck with guys and dating. I feel like I'm a nice person and even though I'm not the hottest girl out there, I also don't think I'm hideous. I've dated some guys who weren't so cute, I've dated guys who were super hot and I've dated guys who are pretty average. I don't really have a type is what I'm saying so idk why I can't find a good dude who sparks my interest.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ocp7jb/why_cant_i_find_a_man/
8,ocp89k,1625279572,Every partner I meet want to be a stay-at-home mom,"Hi I am 34 year old living in MCOL city with 0.01% income &amp; assets (founder IPO money). This is not a brag so please bear with me. It's usually hard to tell what I do unless I tell them where I went to school because I still drink busch light and I curse like sailors hanging out with bunch of hooligans from my childhood (They love me regardless of my income). My assistant also tells me to dress for the job I have regularly as a joke. 

Now, I am not getting any younger and I want to be married with kids one day. In the past years, I've dated all sorts of women from moderately successful to still driving 1998 sunfire. My last girlfriend was a bartender. Normally my relationship is smooth until I divulge my finances few months into my relationships then my partners attitude usually take a drastic turn; 

1) Every partner I had adjust their plan to be a stay-at-home mom as soon as they find out about my income. Now, I have no issue with stay-at-home mom but it turns me off how easy my past girlfriends were wiling to give up their life path and wanting me to finance their lifestyle. It almost makes me see marriage as a simple asset transfer. 

2) High Quality women(not looks, professional accomplishment) do not give me a time of the day until they see me in professional representation or charity dinners. I highly value competence and intelligence in my partner as they will be mother of my children. If they are competent, they can handle rest of my assets and raise children properly with me being gone due to some freak accidents or illness and etc. 

My happily married assistant told me to get a better car, house and I shouldn't be ashamed of ""flaunting my success"". She also told me to take chance on women who want to be with me for my finance because It is a ""natural order"". She also assured me, my future wife will never leave since I have so much wealth. I can't help but think that this is a way to attract predatory individuals into my life. and I really want to meet smart and competent women but they do not give me time of the day! 

3) My money becomes their money and they love to comment on my spending habits. I absolutely spoil my mother and my siblings. I take them out to dinners, nice vacations and buy them nice cars cause I love them and I can afford it without putting a dent to my future self. Before you judge, my mother/much older brother didn't go to college and worked to put me through prestigious university and grad school. Once my partner find out about my finance, every one of my partner commented on how much I spent on my family and tries to frame it as bad thing for some reason even though my family are nothing but wonderful to me. 

All this just makes me bit jaded about my chance of being in happy marriage. All i want is to buy a nice Dacha with direct fiber connection and grow backyard chicken and be in happy marriage. 

Can you please offer some advice in finding good partner?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ocp89k/every_partner_i_meet_want_to_be_a_stayathome_mom/
9,ocp9xy,1625279765,"I got rejected, and it felt great!","I knew this coworker of mine for quite some time, about 3 months or so. Me and her started out as friends and nothing more.

She declined, saying that she hasn’t had the best experience dating a coworker, the ex being abusive to her. I understood how she felt and moved on. We’re still friends, and no awkwardness between us. 

I feel great that I asked her out, not only did I feel confident in myself for asking someone out, but also not wasting my time and thinking, “does she like me?” Without knowing it.

The guy I’ve been casually talking to/seeing reached out yesterday to wish me a happy Canada day.

I sent him a picture of my cocktail (I was out having day drinks with friends), said he was very sweet for thinking to reach out, and told him he was on my mind all day. I’m rarely ever this suggestive, he knows this, but I had a couple of drinks in me and felt like throwing him a bone.

His response: “hey now you cant say something like that and call me the sweet one, i oughta hold up a mirror.” 

His last text being: “but honestly again i dont want to keep you tied to your phone at all, live up the night out! we’ll circle back bc of course youre on my mind too.”

SO THEN I respond by highlighting how nice it was of him to think to message me, and that I wholeheartedly enjoy every moment I get to talk to him. Told him to tap into himself this weekend (he’s in the states for 4th of July celebrations), and that he owes it to himself to have the most fun.

To this, no response. 

He “hearted” two of my messages at 2am (I sent the string of texts at 8pm), but nothing else. We “heart” each other’s texts a lot to acknowledge something that was said, but never like this. I said something very expressive and all he did was shoot me some hearts.

17,ocpswt,1625281844,At war with myself..,"I met this guy eight weeks or so ago and we hit it off immediately. It felt like we’ve known each other our entire lives, it just felt right. It’s been awhile since I’ve truly felt comfortable enough to open up myself to someone. I was in a pretty toxic relationship for four years and I’ve been single for going on two and a half years now. It took me quite some time to heal from that relationship, in order to feel like I was ready to truly commit myself to someone. 

The guy I’m talking about I went to high school with. We never really knew one another but we’ve chatted here and there through Facebook messenger over the years. From what he told me.. he’s had a crush on me for forever just never had the nerve to ask me out. To be honest I never even thought of him in that way but after meeting him in person that changed completely. Our first date.. I don’t think we stopped talking the entire time. It was like I was seeing my best friend for the first time after being apart for so long. And our first kiss was electric and each time we kissed got more intense each time. Still till this day we have a hard time keeping our hands off each other. 

After a few weeks of talking he asked me to be his girlfriend and I of course said yes without hesitation. Even though I did feel we were moving things along rather quickly, it just felt right. Like, damn I finally found MY person. 

It was only two weeks after that though that he decided to end things. I was completely devastated, especially because it came out of nowhere. I guess he wasn’t ready for a relationship and wasn’t able to give me what I truly deserved. I know he has some things he needs to work through due to his past relationship and childhood traumas. I guess I just didn’t realize he was still healing and was that emotionally unavailable. Just didn’t seem that way after all the deep conversations and heart to hearts we had. Telling each other things we’ve never told anyone else. I assumed we both wanted and was ready for the same thing. FYI everything between us was very much reciprocated and not one sided. I’m not your typical delusional female, lol. 

They say if a man truly wants you or loves you there isn’t anything he wouldn’t do for you to make the relationship work. Is that true? Or is there a slight possibility that maybe we are meant to be together but it was just bad timing? If I’m being honest though, there’s still that part of me that thinks maybe I am just not that one for him. I don’t know really what to think..
I guess that’s why I’m posting this in hopes to get some advice and feedback from anyone who’s might of been through something similar. 

I’m 32 years old and I’m ready for a serious relationship. I want marriage and kids..

He’s been chasing me for 2 years now. I kept him in the friend zone. 
This year I kinda started catching feelings for him. So we made it offical and went on our first date. 

He looked at me every time the bill came. 
I paid for everything 3 meals and coffee, I let him crash at my place (he’s from out of town.) 

It was his idea, he insisted on visiting me for this date - I even offered to meet him half way if he wanted. 


If I asked him out it makes sense for me to pay for everything- but he asked me- he was chasing me for 2 years. 

I feel off about it. The last meal I even raised an eyebrow - like SERIOUSLY. 

It’s not an expensive restaurant but still- I paid for everything and even got him a gift. 

Is this a major red flag? 
I know he has money- he’s not broke. 
I woulda been happy to split the bill but he expected me to pay for him too.

My past messed me up for future relationships. I’ll be tying through voice so please don’t mind. 

being a young kid always had social inside the problems that honestly stemmed from personal family issues sucks. What sucks more is when those emotions get manipulated. My last actual girl I dated was in seventh grade. I’m going to be a senior next year for reference. I had a girlfriend before earlier in that year but she was my best friend and saying that we did it it really didn’t seem like we did it and we just drifted away after that but the girl I didn’t in seventh grade for that year it was nice I felt something in my heart that had a mushy and Gucci feeling that for some reason I just loved and although I was young at the time I knew that I did love her. Even though if you go to my pool sister you’ll see that I do have some type of anxiety problems and back then I definitely did have them I was scared to kiss her in our first months of dating. Eventually we did break up and we broke up I had a decent feeling because I didn’t really realize that we like holy shit we’re not together anymore until a few days later after not talking and that’s completely my fault so you guys can flame me in the comments for that one. If it ended like that it would be good but it didn’t. If I remember correctly that summer or year later we talked again. This time we were sort of messing and I was really vulnerable because it was the girl I loved and I was talking to her again I was head over heels and honestly starstruck because of it. 


We didn’t really meet up a lot we did have times that I would go to the park and see you there and we chatted on recent like that but we were usually texting and FaceTime me I just got an iPhone that year so we were on FaceTime a lot. Then we went to the movies it was her friends birthday and they all went to the movies and we were talking and she said that she wanted me to go and I was like sure I’ll see in a leave that my parents would give me the money and go ahead to go because it was around 8 o’clock and I was still around 13 or 14. But once I got to go ahead to go and I got dropped off with the money I said I’ll be there and I came into the movie theater sat down she saw me she saw her friend and her friend knew about us she smiled because she was happy that her friend was happy I guess and she sat up with me and we watched the slender man movie.(weird movie lol) and it was there that we actually didn’t have our first kiss there but we had our first week passionate kiss there if it makes any sense we did had to have our first kiss a different time when I went to her house because I just came around that’s something that we did well that I did I would ride my bike around to her house she will come outside we talked for a little bit and I would leave but that time she was waiting when I was leaving I turned around looked at her she looked at me and I walked up and kissed her. 


That first because that’s corny as it sounds and I don’t think as masculine as people think it is it was magical head even still remember to this day that her lips felt like Marshmallows. So after explaining my first case I’ll go back to the movie theater and we had a more passionate kisser and I a lot of the movie but I do remember us kissing a lot there and I was doing through puberty at the time and I uh nvm. but after the movie ended and I was waiting for her to leave and for me to leave actually she waited for me at the exit to leave the movie room and she kissed me again and shit walking out we played a few other games in the movie lobby and my dad picked me up and she got picked up and we went home. 


At home I thought that I was like the king of the world because I really never had a date night like that and that’s when she called me. She was calling me crying and I didn’t know what was wrong I’d her hey what’s wrong what happened and she said I’m sorry my mom found out and we can’t see each other anymore. I was heartbroken and I faintly remember me just going quiet and me just sitting back at my bed going through my mind like what the hell happened what happened and she asked me if I was still there and he still struggles in stoned I said yeah yeah I’m here and it was a lot of silence and a lot of faint crying in a way and I never really criedTo anyone I don’t like to cry quite a lot actually but they’re in my dark room my parents are probably in the room to be fine but I was in my dark room with the phone light on the very slightly lighting up in me just seen you crying she never heard me cry before and she asked me if I’m all right I said I’m I’ll talk to you later. After that I remember being just depressed because she’s like the only girl that I’m really able to open up to like that and she’s just gone so I was just stuck there to bottle up 

of course my friends were around just like any other friends that are Dickheadz so you can’t really take them seriously or they don’t take you seriously. Another year goes by and it’s just summer again and she’s talking to a guy that honestly I feel completely sorry for him if somehow he recess I am sorry for everything that happened. She was talking to a guy and she was texting me. She cheated on her current current boyfriend at the time with me and I saw him all the time with her snap and he was honestly look like a really good guy and he all he had was to love someone. But I allowed her to cheat on him with me now since I’m older I completely see that terrible acting that in this cheating thing happens a lot in my little story so be ready. I was well aware that she was cheating and my friends told me that I need to break up with her and I need to stop this because she’s cheating on another guy with me it’s terrible it’s terrible and I was getting mad and that’s because she was the only one to give me a chance she is besides family or anything like that she was the person that I loved that I could never disrespect someone that guy in my deepest feelings wholeheartedly loved. And they simply didn’t see that and saw that when she was in was wrong but they didn’t do anything to stop it they would try to tell me encouraged me to stop but other then that they stayed in a lane and didn’t intrude or anything. 

Like I said I now I know that it was terrible but back then I was just so happy that the person I loved I was talking to again and we started to go really dates but I consider him as dates we did live close and her mom her mom is an ex cop and she was very strict at the time before she really got to know me so she didn’t really just allow her daughter to just leave out with me So she would tell her mom that she’s going out to walk the dog because it was summer and walking your dog is something that you normally do and we would meet up halfway because I lived maybe around the corner from her and we would meet up and walk together and be like a couple. Then after a while of doing this she ended it again she said that I don’t wanna do it anymore I wanted to take the relationship serious. That of course was a lie. She bad talk to them all the time to me. So I stood up for myself I said why this is happening so much why do I always lose and constantly lose with you when am I going to win. I was basically having a mental shut down and those aren’t common with me but I do have times where it does happen. It’s kind of genetic like in my dad side of the family but we haven’t experienced something like that in a while. I was basically having a mental shut down in I guess he just yelling at her saying that why do I always lose wives why do I never win it makes no sense why am I would feel like I’m the last pig for anything and just ranting and it ended up with her saying goodbye and she left.

No it’s around ninth or 10th grade I’m not sure bye of course we talked again. I asked her about what happened to the aches she said she broke up with him and I was basically it I didn’t do it push any more towards it and just like before we start talking again and have those little couple meet ups and what not and of course I like again she cheated on another guy with me. Now around this time she started to have sex. And I was talking to her about it and she was just upset with me saying that she’s tired of him stuff like that and that she’s sad about sex and I asked her what was sad about it or what’s the problem with it and she said she didn’t want her first time to be with him and If you have any type of common sense I’m guessing you know it’s going to come up next she said that she wanted her first time to be with me and I still to this day don’t believe that’s a lie I personally do not believe that I feel that our first break up or second I guess in a way where we are actually more mature into it that that really wasn’t helpful because her mother was like oh shit before strict so I do believe that around that time that she didn’t want her first time to be with me but you guys can decide that. So for some context before we started talking there was another girl that I was talking to and I asked her out some stuff I got friend zoned or rejected either way I didn’t care about it that much but I kind of was a little sad about it but it was a girl that pretty cute and nice and all so a Texter got rejected and I said you know what I’ll take a break not a break as soon yo I’m tired of all these girls just a break for my own I guess well-being and for a refresher so I took a break and when I came back I had a lot of text from her now why don’t you take a break I don’t mean I just deleted apps I mean I completely just didn’t use my phone for around probably around a month it was a wild time. But I had a lot of notifications from courts to exit been talking about and she was asking if I’m all right and cause I had one of my friends handling checks for me and stuff like that nothing big Texan be like I’m not here on our course I from my closer friends that knew about my whole situation I told him to tell anyone that I talked about to them to tell them the truth about everything that happened because we were all close in away so I told him to tell the truth on now and they told my ex and she basically bombarded my phone asking if I’m all right and stuff like that and that’s another instance where I see that I believe that she actually cared but anyway going back to the whole cheating thing. She cheated on another guy with me and it was of course the same usual meeting up dates and some other stuff like that and she seemed genuine on when she was saying stuff about him and saying that she actually did hate him because honestly I have read the text and if I’m being honest he’s kind of a dick. And we were doing good and I feel like I messed it up because what happened was we were talking and I of course I put on the ground talking to because I am more so of a one lady person so she was only girls talking to you I said you know I took her saying you know I don’t really like that you have to play both ends and you knows you’re on two different guys and I just want to be the main guy and I feel that I would treat you really well clearly I’m Richard and I’m not a little kid as when we did before. And I’ll be sneaky ranting about stuff like that and how better and I feel that she isn’t right and doing this and I was I had a brief moment where I was really standing up for myself and seeing my own worth


But it ended up with her saying that hi I have to leave you I have to leave you this isn’t good for your health and she was right she was honestly right it wasn’t good for my health at all but I was so in a love trend I said I don’t give a fuck about my health I know what I wanted to do she then said bye goodbye again and of course I wouldn’t kill my depressing state again and I was just out of it for the next year until a week before my birthday I was completely out of it I’m completely out of it but I was I was healing and someways I was healing and then she texted me while I was at work. You see now I’m 16 I think and I I have a job now I can make money so you know I i’m kinda ballin in a little bit I was hype that I was making money now so I can I can buy stuff that I want and of course she didn’t know that so she didn’t really have the whole Golddigger thing going on and By the end of the day with everything going on not going to get into the specifics but I winded up seeing her naked. Now this right here it was like heaven cause don’t get me wrong I dated her we had a good time is and I was wrong I feel that I was in gay and I wanted to do whatever I could for her but seeing her naked it was a blessing I’ll just say that. End it was going pretty good she wasn’t talking to anyone we were meeting up from time to time going on actually deep deeds and it was coming up to be around Black Friday so I went out shopping and I didn’t tell her any of this and I did buy her a necklace. No cords and tell her any of this I was going to surprise her one day and it came up to be my birthday weekend and on the day that I got off a Friday we went out we went out to see IT but of course we did kind a half to wiggle her way into it and she said we weren’t the right age to actually going to see it will be able to see it and we kind of didn’t get kicked out but it was fun and I remember walking around with her and she had I don’t know if this is right to see if I’m objectifying her anything

But she had a really nice body will in my chest because I did like women that do eat you know I’m saying I like my girl with a little little meat on their bones as my parents would say. End it was nice to have you by my side in theaters and she said oh I know if you guys here and I said oh for real and she said yeah but I don’t really talk to him or anything so it’s it’s all cool but she was one of the Prettier girls in the school so a lot of the school knew her and I guess they thought that they were quiet or anything but it’s night time and like no one‘s around us so when they walked by and they saw her in her likings they said yo she got a fat ass I know that she heard it and I just looked at them with you what the fuck bro honestly I’m really not an aggressive guy so I put up a front on that honestly not gonna lie I was scared shitless because I can’t fight and I don’t like the violence so if they do pull up onus do you guys what was I supposed to say chill out? Iwas honestly scared

But having her by my side although I was scared I was able to put up a front of me being more aggressive and I kind a like that. Besides that we had a pretty good night her mom drop me home now at this time her mom did like me and we are pretty well known so she was bringing me home and she asked of course her daughter what did you eat now she completely blanked out on what she ate which is terrible because when you go out to see a movie for reference she told her mom that the movie Ended like 30 to 40 minutes ago so she said that you were out eating but the movie really wasn’t done yet so she was trying to remember what she ate anything I had to text you or text so I actually spoke up to your mom and I said I said I don’t know how she doesn’t remember but we had like pizza or Chinese and she said OK then laughing because I think I think she knew What was going on and I’m happy she knew about that. No like how are usually say before then when I got home we broke up and we didn’t actually we were pretty chill until the day before my birthday when I was out at the mall because my job took us there to shop.

Mid shopping way we were talking texting actually and she said someone’s texting you now I took it as a joke it’s texting me and and I was just like oh this is your friendly guys doing LOL and she said text him back and if your texting to find out that it was a guy that she was also talking to. And she gave my number to the guy to text and was basically telling me that I’m pathetic for Cheating here for years now and hi me too honestly grow up and that she likes him and other stuff like that. No remember reading those in she was laughing at me and that she told him to see all that and when I asked her she said it’s true that she sees me as someone who is pathetic and clingy

And now I’m standing in the middle of the mall just crying because the person that I love said all those hateful things and I was just destroyed my coworkers ask me what’s wrong I didn’t say anything my parents and friends asked me what’s wrong and I didn’t say anything I was just broken in a way and I kept it to myself I didn’t really tell anyone about it because I didn’t want to until two days later where on her snap they did ask me anything in a question came up about me and her asking if we kiss it still don’t know who asked that question probably one of my dumbass friends but that isn’t the point. She said no I wouldn’t kiss him when I died never did anything like that do anything like that and I saw that just broke my spirit and I was talking to my friends in a PlayStation party and one of my friends told me to keep my head up and I don’t know what it was what about that comment fueled me up ages to go orphanages I posted back so we can subs now and I was really standing up for myself. Then she released the text messages on where everyone can see it and I was just humiliated.


I honestly couldn’t believe that she would do that and that’s when my breaking point with her really started. We had a whole big argument argument on snap in group chats on one on ones and eventually it came to work she got her friend switch and she actually got a hit on me I never thought that I would see the day where the person I loved legitimately wanted me dead. I am of course sorry to say but I am holding back tears and that’s when she said that I only did this all of this because I felt bad and now I don’t feel bad anymore I actually do it I never liked you I never will.

That hit me harder than any punch any cake or anything that anyone could have done to me I don’t think a lot of people know how it feels you honestly loved him with all your heart wants you dead and said that they only did it because they felt bad that that really hit me in a way that I never thought that anything would how did she said that I stopped a sister who argument and he just simply stopped with everything I remember my friends being in the party they also saw what was going on and I was really every message and they were stunned as much is me although that they did see it coming we’re in disbelief that anyone would actually say that. She did block me that day and it won’t look good for a while actually till May the middle of my 10th grade year either the middle or the winter of my 10th grade year where she did snap me and she asked what happened to us and when I saw it I didn’t get excited I didn’t get mad I said extremely how I felt and that I didn’t like how I would be treated at all throughout the yeas and that she honestly needs help she saw that and she understood that she understoodw because we do you have an argument anything bad about me she said I know she’s actually seeing a therapist psychologist whatever now and we have texted as a couple or anything but as yes I catch up and to apologize she did apologize for it to happen. It was nice to see you it was a sincere apology and I said that I accept now I won’t date her again and barely as a friend but I’m happy I’m free but all that trauma won’t just go away.

30,ocrczs,1625288190,"After going NC and distant with FWB, he kept on texting and asking me to see him and gave me a pet as a gift. What is he thinking?","Im seeing this guy for a year now. Nothing serious. We decided we’re not compatible in the long run so we kept it casual. We only see each other once a month. Our routine mostly consists of hook up, netflix, cuddle and sleepovers. In between, we would text each other about our day. This was okay in the beginning but for the last few months, I felt like im getting attached. I did NC for 1 month, ignoring all of his texts, but broke it off when I received a text from him begging me to noticed him. So we’re back on our usual set-up.

Yesterday he asked me if I wanted a fish as a pet as he has been growing an interest on fish tanks lately. I said yes and he came over to my place carrying a bowl (very difficult to bring while driving btw). I was touched by his effort. He also promised to bring food for the fish the next day so I wont have to be hassled in feeding the fish. We hooked up that night and lied cuddling in bed for a bit before he left for work. 

A part of me doesnt want to see him for two days in a row as to avoid getting too attached. I swear he had made it very clear that he doesnt want a relationship so there’s kinda like an unspoken rule that this is just going to be casual. I dont want to look like im fishing for labels also as im not really sure if I like him or only the idea of him. The thing is every time I go NC or post something on social media like im going out with someone. He would go crazy and would chat me nonstop and ask me if im already dating someone else. This has been going on for a year. Every time, I would decide to go NC and be at peace, he would bombard me with texts and chats. I know I should be putting up my boundaries more but I live alone and the pandemic makes it difficult for me to resist temptations. It gets really lonely sometimes and I found myself responding to him after awhile.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ocrczs/after_going_nc_and_distant_with_fwb_he_kept_on/

What is that supposed to mean?!.

Context:

I (20m) asked out a girl (21f) I liked (for about a year or 2) and she said:  “Yea I’m down, I think your kinda cute but you might be a lil immature for your age, because normally girls mature faster than dudes” 
I don’t consider that a rejection but I’m concerned because she’s only 9 months older than me, and I think I’m pretty mature, I have a job, I live alone, I don’t drink that often, I don’t smoke, I don’t do drugs, I’m not a asshole, I pay my taxes and shit like that and she knows about those things.

Should I be concerned about this, maybe she wants another kinda dude, or maybe she did rejected me, but what is that answer supposed to mean.

And yes maybe it’s a stupid question but I’m not a guy that has been in a million relationships, so I’m not that experienced that’s why I’m asking.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ocrqtj/i_think_your_kinda_cute_but_you_might_be_immature/

Everything was going amazing for a while and both of us were spending so much time together up until 2 weeks ago where he had a breakdown and said he felt like he doesn’t know what he wants (having come out of a 6 year relationship a year and a half ago and also going through a tough time in his personal life) but said he has real feelings for me and doesn’t want to lose me to another guy. We agreed we would take things more slow so that he could work on his mental health and sort his shit out and see one another once a week. Lately sometimes he can go the entire day without interacting with me once, he doesn’t ever make plans with me in advance (and was also that way before all this too). For example he called me last night at 5pm asking what I’m doing for the night and when I said I was busy he got upset and I told him I was free today. But even still, I had to call him today to ask what time was suitable, and he hadnt opened my message on snap from 18 hours ago but said he was just playing Xbox.. it is now 3:30pm and he still hasn’t even given me a concrete time when I asked him to let me know, and he wants to hang tonight?!

43,oct3u2,1625296231,Controlling or reasonable?,"Okay so my girlfriend likes to wear slightly more revealing clothes and it makes sense because she really does (not trying to brag but I mean, hey) have an incredible body. She recently bought a couple new tops and one of them is beyond revealing. Not only is it see through but it shows a lot of side boob and what not, far beyond just cleavage. She said she’d only wear it with pasties to cover her nipples considering that its see through but the idea of other guys seeing her in this ONE shirt does honestly kinda make my skin crawl. I love her other revealing tops and I love being able to be by her side when she wears them, but this one top puts me over the edge just because of how much it shows. 

So this brings me to my question,

If I ask her if she’d only wear it in a social setting if I’m there with her, is that controlling? 

To try and phrase it better in case that’s confusing, I’m asking her to just pick a different shirt, any but that ONE if I’m not able to be by her side in a social setting, if I’m able to be with her, wear it as often as you’d like.

I’m 5ft 2, I have long black hair, brown eyes, I weigh around 130lbs. I don’t drink, smoke or do any kind of drugs or even tried it. So if it’s something you do we probably won’t get along. I’m loyal and caring, and I would like to find a shy and sweet guy who’s the same.

46,octwyh,1625300243,How do I mentally prepare myself for the possibility no one will ever want me?,"22 m never had a girlfriend only ever had sex once with a hooker. This is all my fault given the fact that I essentially avoided anything to do with girls for the first 21 years of my life due to my extremely low self esteem (I believe I may even have a mild case of body dysmorphia) 
 I even turned to plastic surgery after high school, and my not wanting to attend parties or social gathering in college due to my introverted nature. 

Now I’ve graduated college and am much less shy than I was I enjoy parties now but unfortunately it’s too late, school is over, I missed out on that time in life where those things are supposed to happen. I try to cold approach girls a lot now but I’m always getting rejected, even when they give me their number they ghost me, happened once again today.

Not sure what’s wrong with me.
Despite my extreme insecurities I’ve been told I’m not ugly. When I’m talking with girls I don’t feel like it’s not going well. If it was just a few rejections I wouldn’t care but the number is beginning to pile up.

She is completely blocked on all social media and I will never speak to her again. I don’t feel ready to seek love again, and I may never be.","I feel extremely hesitant to let someone in, because I’m afraid they’re going to lead me on like my crush did. My crush and I also had some very intimate conversations even when she had a boyfriend (she and I met before they did), almost at a sexting level, although this may have to do with the fact that we met because of a fetish that we both had.

She led me on, twice. The first time was when we met last summer (when we were doing the intimate convos quite frequently) and then she did it for a while in the winter by basically saying that she wished she was with me even though she never broke up with her boyfriend. I don’t think she loved me, despite things she’s said and done, because even though we live 90 minutes apart, love knows no bounds.

I don’t like leaving the house, except for when I have to go to work, for the most part. I feel like isolating myself to my room for the rest of time so that nobody has to deal with me. I’m not lovable and even if I meet someone I don’t think that there will be any chance of it going well.

We get along really well and have a lot in common as well as share similar world views. However, I still can’t tell if I’m totally in it for him like he is for me. I don’t love him. I don’t know if he loves me. We both have a deep appreciation for each other but this is where the line is drawn. I keep dwelling on things that he did whether it be jokes or mistakes he has made already that really bother me and fill me with resentment and I know it’s selfish of me to have internalized these things.  I’m helping him through a transitory time in his life and he’s very grateful for that but sometimes I feel like I let him walk all over me in the name of jokes and teasing and I don’t get much back in return other than the company of a good enough guy. The relationship almost feels childish, but also mature and laid back. We’re both old souls and we put any problems we have out on the table right away...but something feels like it’s missing. I lie awake at night thinking of things that have bothered me that make me feel insecure and even ashamed or embarrassed. Things he has done that were a small cry from intolerable but also innocent because they were mistakes due to lack of self awareness.  We are both very young in our early twenties and these times can be unstable I get that.

At the volunteer house I am staying at there is a really cute guy who visits for a few days most weeks in between travelling around doing jobs/research. He works sometimes for the organisation which is why he sometimes uses the house. 

I just don’t know how to subtly show I find him attractive or how to know if he finds me. His first language is obviously Italian and I know he has a slight disdain for speaking English with volunteers (don’t blame him). My Italian is mostly a few words/phrases but I try speak them and understand Italian where I can. So it is difficult for me to initiate conversation because I know he doesn’t like speaking English but I can’t speak Italian well yet. 

Most of the time I think he doesn’t find me attractive at all — he often goes off on his own, doesn’t look at me much at all, and doesn’t often initiate conversation, but maybe this is also his personality/the language problem.

Sometimes we have really nice conversations about niche things or he will ask me questions about myself but he is probably just being friendly. Although, the first evening he visited he said I had a beautiful name and yesterday we went to the bar to watch football and he was showing me what offside was by moving bottles, he kept placing his hands where mine were on the bottles/glasses.

Still I feel like I’m reading into a lot of this and I don’t know how to subtly know if he finds me in any way attractive or how to get to know him more. Also he often just speaks Italian with the other volunteer who is here a lot so I struggle to keep up with conversation.

You might remember, a while back, I texted you a lot which resulted in you getting irritated and pissed. It was between our higher secondary and first year (2 years ago).

**I hate asking these questions, because you never know if someone likes you until you ask. And plus I won’t be able to ask her out for another two weeks.**

I’m a 21yo guy and she’s 19yo. We just started working together a couple weeks ago. One female coworker that I’m friends with said that she thinks this girl likes me, but I’m not sure. Apparently she flirts with me but I’m not sure. Here are some things that may be signs...

*I catch her looking at me often. She’s a very observant person, so I don’t think that this is a sign. I catch her looking at me at least twice a day.*

*She remembers a lot about me. I’ll mention something once and she’ll remember it. Even really small things.*

*We tease each other often. Like today we were shooting trash in a trash can I she said how if we played basketball 1v1 she’d beat me. We tease each other about our food tastes all day. 50% of our conversations is just us teasing each other about something.*

*Yesterday we got tipped at our job, but because of my position I couldn’t accept the tip. I jokingly said I was upset, and she said she’s bring my a Gatorade and some sour skittles (we talked earlier about our love of sour skittles). Sure enough, this morning she brought me some. I will say that I’ve had female coworkers buy me random snacks before, but it was always platonic and they never bought me a snack they knew I loved.*

She definitely gives off tomboy vibes, so there’s a chance that she might be gay. Of course I’m not sure, though. Obviously I won’t know for sure if she likes me, but what do you all think?

However, recently the tables turned. I asked her out casually 2-3 times, wasn't like and official date invitation, but she always came up with an excuse. So I thought, alright, guess she doesn't like me in this way, we'll just stay friends, that's fine. We're in the same friend group after all.

So I proceeded to act as usual, just friendly, no flirts etc. Her birthday came shortly after and I sent her a happy birthday message, very short and casual again. She said thanks.

However, when the birthday party came she invited EVERYONE in our friend group + a couple of other people, except me. I thought WOW, that's weird, I guess she doesn't even like me as a person then?

So I decided to keep my distance with her when we're out. Yesterday we're watching a football game with my friends, she was there too. She would occasionally ask me something and I would keep my answers short and try not to engage with her at all. She seemed a little surprised, but didn't say much about it.

So my question is, am I doing the right thing? I don't wanna make things weird and ruin the good atmosphere in our friend group, but I also don't want to act if nothing has changed, because quite honestly I feel a bit insulted. What would you do?

84,ocy8vg,1625319550,"I need some advice, idk if i’m just being insecure rn or if this is normal to feel weird about…","


So i’ve (M20) been dating this really sweet girl (F21) for some time. Yesterday she asked me “what are we” and told be she would like to become something serious. I said i’d love to but need some time. After that - out of the blue - she asks me “how many girls have you slept with in total?” 

I was sort of speechless cause i thought that was odd, but told her the truth (i’ve slept with way to many, to the point where i actually lie often cause it sort of embarassing idk)

Lo and behold, she tells me her ‘body count’. She have slept with the exact amount, minus 1. 70% guys 30% girls ish. I really wish she didn’t tell me cause i went so awkward after that, i could only give her one word responses. The only girls i’ve been with have been with max 5 or something, so it was quite a shocker for me. 

I seriously dont know how i feel about it. Something tells me it’s immature to be insecure about, something tells me that it’s weird of me to be turned off about it something i’ve done myself… yet i feel like it was so so unnecessary for her to tell me that, i really wish she didn’t ask me that question 

What do you guys think?

Need to adress that i’ve never had a gf while she have had a bf before, so i felt like her bodycount is extreme compared to me, since i’ve always been single (by choice)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ocy8vg/i_need_some_advice_idk_if_im_just_being_insecure/

I had some girls interested in me, even bootycalling me, but I somehow sabotaged it and did not have much action then. I hade a couple of makeout sessions while being abroad and had something like sex (went rly bad), but I guess technically it was sex. So now I got the feeling that the older I get, the worse it gets.

When we talk, he asks a lot of questions and when I ask him questions he answers them in a lot of detail. I keep pushing myself to do the same.

At the beginning of last week I messaged him and he told me he didn’t want to push me but he’s very happy I thought of him. He asked me out on a date. Throughout the week the same thing happened. He kept checking in when I didn’t respond for a while. 

Yesterday I pretty much avoided him the whole day. I wasn’t having a great day. He asked how my day went and I didn’t go into detail. He didn’t respond. 

Should I be honest and apologise for the way I was acting? Is there any point now if he’s had enough of me? I still want to see him, I feel like nothing is translating over text.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ocyg3i/should_i_apologise/
88,ocyjut,1625320664,How to know if attractive Italian guy likes me British (20F) whilst interning in Italy,"I am interning/volunteering in Italy for the summer (am British). At the volunteer house I am staying at there is a really cute guy who visits for a few days most weeks in between travelling around doing jobs/research. He works sometimes for the organisation which is why he sometimes uses the house. 

I just don’t know how to subtly show I find him attractive or how to know if he finds me. His first language is obviously Italian and I know he has a slight disdain for speaking English with volunteers (don’t blame him). My Italian is mostly a few words/phrases but I try speak them and understand Italian where I can. So it is difficult for me to initiate conversation because I know he doesn’t like speaking English but I can’t speak Italian well yet. 

Most of the time I think he doesn’t find me attractive at all — he often goes off on his own, doesn’t look at me much at all, and doesn’t often initiate conversation, but maybe this is also his personality/the language problem.

Sometimes we have really nice conversations about niche things or he will ask me questions about myself but he is probably just being friendly. Although, the first evening he visited he said I had a beautiful name and yesterday we went to the bar to watch football and he was showing me what offside was by moving bottles, he kept placing his hands where mine were on the bottles/glasses.

Still I feel like I’m reading into a lot of this and I don’t know how to subtly know if he finds me in any way attractive or how to get to know him more. Also he often just speaks Italian with the other volunteer who is here a lot so I struggle to keep up with conversation.

Any tips? 

Tldr: trying to figure out if a guy I am volunteering with finds me attractive through a disdain for English and very lone-wolf behaviour",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ocyjut/how_to_know_if_attractive_italian_guy_likes_me/

Do you think this is a bad thing?,"Let's be honest with each other, almost everyone masturbated at least once in his lives, even the majority of girls tried it, but for many, this self sexual activity is still seen as bad for some reason, so, i would like to discuss it here.

For singles: how often do you maturbate? 

For engaged people: do you masturbate? If yes, how often, and why since you have a partner? Also, do you think masturbating while engaged is bad? if yes, why?

90,ocynws,1625321031,Is it unreasonable to ask for plans to be confirmed the day before they’re meant to happen?,"I (23F) was asked out by a guy (29M) I briefly dated in the past. In the past he was extremely flakey but I’ve decided to give him another chance, but this time im not expecting much out of it and im also not waiting around, but I’m open to seeing where it goes.

Earlier this week, we decided we were going to go out on Saturday (just the day, we didn’t decide on anything else) but I told him to message me the day before with the plan/time so I can plan my day or I’ll assume we’re no longer going out. I didn’t get a text all day yesterday so I assumed the plans were off and planned to run errands today and went to bed. Given how flakey he was in the past, i assumed he wasn’t free anymore (which has been the case before)

He ended up messaging me at 11:57pm when he knows im almost always asleep by then so I won’t see it until this morning so I told him he should have messaged me yesterday and that we’re not going out. He said ‘please, I booked something for us’ and I said ‘why couldn’t you have told me this yesterday’ and still stuck with my decision to not go out.

He’s now angry and thinks it’s my fault for ‘not keeping my day free’ 

I specifically told him to message me the day before so I can plan my day otherwise I’ll assume it’s off so I don’t think he has any right to get angry. He’s used to cancel on me all the time before even last minute after I’ve gotten ready so I don’t think this was an unreasonable call from me.

I always prefer at least an idea of time and the plan so I can plan my day, plan my outfit, other preparations etc which takes time for me and I like to put in effort for dates, especially as this almost feels like a first date again since it’s been that long

This has made me feel like I’m inadequate and that he doesn’t see that me liking other girls is ‘real’. I asked him if he’d be ok for a threesome with another guy and he said he wouldn’t let any guy near m. This has made me feel undervalued and disrespected.

I’m more into Latino / white guys. In my area it’s hard to find Asian guys. I’ve talked to guys who have ghosted me or lead me on and I don’t know what I’ve done wrong.

95,oczoah,1625324451,Dating as a bisexual person has been harder than when I was “”straight””,"I, 26F, have been single for a little over four years. The bulk of my dating experience (like 99%) has been with straight cis men. I came out as bisexual before the pandemic but haven’t been able to do a whole lot of gay dating (dating women and other non-men) due to my work schedule and then the lockdown happening last year.

Since becoming vaccinated, I’ve only been interested in pursuing dating women and non-binary people for the time being. But damn, it’s tough. On apps like tinder, I’m lucky if I get one match in a week. Even luckier if they respond at all. Even luckier still if I get a date or two. With women specifically, I’ll feel like we’ve hit it off great, it’ll start off very flirty and frequently texting, and then I get ghosted after the second or third date. It’s getting harder to brush it off and not take it as there’s something “wrong” or “off” about me.

I’m getting sad and discouraged. I’ve wanted to explore this part of myself for so long, but I didn’t know there would be frequent rejection and confusion along with the discomfort of still learning to be proudly bisexual.

talking to my mom , the longest conversation that I've had with women was like 1 minute , like talking to a receptionist or a female waitress.

And I've asked a lot of people about this issue , and most of them , even friends , have told me to just give up at this point and not even bother , cuz I'm too old to start dating and that I'm going to find it extremely difficult to date someone , or to connect with women in general , it's too late and nearly impossible.

So is it too late for me , cuz I really feel that way , I've set up a tinder account long ago and I got 0 matches and no woman seems to give a f\*#K.

Also even if a woman did match with me , and we agree on a date , what the hell am I going to say to her , I really have no idea what people do on dates , or what is it all about , or how to talk to a woman , it's all so foreign and strange to me , and I've even tried to imagine the conversation and the scenario in my head , but I can't even imagine it , it's that strange and foggy.
