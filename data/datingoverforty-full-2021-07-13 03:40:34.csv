I separated from my STBX about 8 months ago, and I'm now just waiting out the full year so we can finalize a divorce. I entered the dating world basically for the first time 4 months ago after 20 years in a relationship, 15 years of marriage, and 2 school-age kids. To my surprise it was a better experience than I expected and I quickly started dating someone regularly. 

I was up-front about my separated status, and we had a good conversation early on about where I am in life: that a long-term relationship was not my priority right now, but that I wouldn't want to just arbitrarily end something that felt right. A lot of things HAVE felt right, and if it wasn't my first new relationship and so soon after separating, I would certainly want to keep seeing her to discover where things go. I've become more conscious of a few of the negatives I do see, and I planned to bring them up, but I realized some of these may be due to her understandable ambivalence or fear of committing given where I am in life. I'm realizing now the best thing for me is to end things soon before they get too serious. I should have gone into this more firmly focused on keeping things casual instead of leading her (and myself) on. 

This is probably dating 101, but ending anything other than a long marriage is brand new to me. I think my natural inclination is to always pursue a serious relationship, so it feels really strange and selfish to end something that has never had any major problems. But I know logically that I just need more variety of dating experience before I trust myself to enter into something long-term (and I think I deserve to just have some fun). So two questions:

1) If you have been in a similar situation in the past, how did you handle it? 

2) A specific courtesy-related question: One quirk that is an issue for me is that she has never invited me to her own apartment, despite her coming over here many times (and even lamenting about her friend who is dating a guy that hasn't invited HER over). Regardless of the actual reason why, I'm trying to figure out where to have this conversation with her. I'd prefer in person and at her place so she doesn't have to go anywhere after hearing the news, but that doesn't seem to be an option. Maybe somewhere outdoors, but not in a busy place, like a park? A phone call seems too impersonal after 4 months of dating.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,53035,public,self,I'm going to initiate a break-up for the first time at age 43.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ojett7/im_going_to_initiate_a_breakup_for_the_first_time/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was the one to call it off, I do love her ...but there are too many incompatibilities there.  she's a great person and has done nothing 'wrong' in the relationship. There was just something missing there for me and I felt it best to split for my own wellbeing, rather than stay with someone lovely who I just don't feel 100% about. 

It just hurts so much to do it. Everything is still fresh and raw, I miss her so much and I'm crying all the time. My chest is aching, I can't sleep and I have a knot in my stomach. Heartbreak REALLY hurts and it completely sucks. I don't know how long I will feel bad for. 

I'm trying to take it each day at a time. I keep running the decision over and over in my head - did I make the right choice? Could I have tried harder to make it work? It's so painful and I am so sad and disappointed that this didn't work out.

 I think she wants to get back together and give things another go. I am having to be so strict in my mind with myself, reminding that there were solid reasons of incompatibility (schedules, priorities, leisure time, mental health, affection levels....) that i need to remind myself of. The missing her and the loneliness is so overwhelming, I can see it would be so easy just to get back together. But i know deep down that this relationship isn't right for me. I think i need to be on my own and single for a long while, I suspect i have some unfinished healing to do from my divorce, this break up has reignited some old wounds.

We seem to get on really well, and everything else has been incredible.  I certainly have no complaints with regards to our time together, we seem to enjoy each other’s company, and are very attracted to one another.  So far so good, right?

The other night we were together at my house, she was staying over.  I was doing some work repairing some photos she wanted to have up in frames, so I’m sitting at my computer and she’s sat behind me on her phone while I work.  She’s chatting to friends via WhatsApp, something that seems to be common but not - until this occasion - something I personally have an issue with.  We are comfortable enough to chat and or sit in silence together and reply to messages of friends do so.

But on this occasion I turn to ask her opinion of some work I’m doing to one of her photos, and she’s scrolling up two photos that, although I only saw them briefly, are obviously of a naked man with his hand just covering his junk.  She types a reply and closes WhatsApp.  I sat waiting for a comment or something but nothing is said.  We then left my work room and return to the living room.

It was then that I asked what the photo was?  She replied that her friend often sends her naked photos of men, as a joke or because they think she’d like them.  And that her and her other friend often laugh at them when they’re sent.

Now I’ll point out that this other friend is a man.  And someone she spends a lot of time with, there are weeks that she’ll not be able to see me because they’re out together, he’s a lorry driver and they’ll be on the road.  

I can’t help but feel that these photos were probably from him and of him, seeing as they were also arranging for him to pick her up the next day and then she’d spend time with him for a couple of days.

It must be added that she hates to be at her home, as she feels unsafe their due to her ex living nearby, I have seen her there and she’s absolutely a wreck and constantly anxious.  I’m not making excuses but understand that her being away from there, be it with me or with her friend are understandable.

I have since had it out with her that I feel that there’s something going on and she has obviously stated that there isn’t and apologised for not explaining better and making me feel like there was something going on.  But I still can’t shake the feeling that while she’s away with her friend they’re not just being friends, if that makes sense to anyone?

We talk every day, including when she’s with her friend, both via texting on WhatsApp and on the phone, but when it’s not text based all comments regarding feelings are missing.  I understand that she might be worried her fiend would lecture her that we’ve not been seeing each other long enough, but I’m not talking messages of undying love just sounds of blowing kisses, or general ily that she has said when he’s not around are always missing when he is.

So, after all this long explanation etc.  Basically help.  Am I being overly sensitive and reading into stuff that’s not or shouldn’t be an issue or do you think my concerns are based in something that does sound suspect?

Am 45, was married 20 years but relationship went bad 11 yrs ago.  Stayed for the kids, but we didn’t know how to give each other what we needed.

Im sorta an “all or nothing “ person.  One of the reasons i decided to end the marriage.  it was agonizing being with someone who had shown she didn’t really care about me

I had really been “out” of the relationship for about 8 years…. and was ready to move on.

A funny thing has happened that i didn’t expect.  

I have very little interest in meeting new people and learning if i am compatible.  I have met a few people, gone on a few dates, and at first am interested and it’s exciting.  As soon as they express interest, I start to pull back and not want to go thru with anything.

I have two female friends that are divorced and im pretty close with.  We will message a few times a week, and maybe get together every few months.  Dinner, drinks, baseball game etc.

And of course the “one that got away “ is still out there.

We reconnected and it was amazing.  I never lost feelings for her, and am so thankful to have her back in my life in some capacity.  But, for a variety of reasons a real relationship with her is not feasible.

As i navigate this journey, i am realizing the only person i desire a relationship with is the one that got away.  And its not in the cards.

So….do people just hang w their friends and carry on w their life? I never thought id be alone, long term.

Since then, I’ve been trying to make up for lost time and figure out how this whole dating thing works and what I want in a partner. So far, I’ve had exactly one relationship that lasted longer than 9 months (probably would have lasted longer but we broke up under pandemic stress).

I’ve been going on a lot of dates since I got vaccinated a few months ago, and I’m slowly realizing that even if I find a guy physically attractive, I panic if he makes moves on a first date because it feels like pressure to immediately reciprocate. In fact I’ve been on two first dates where I was initially on the fence about their physical attractiveness, but because they limited physical contact to hello &amp; goodbye hugs I felt that I had room to explore my feelings in my own time, so I gave them a second date chance and only after then did I start to find them attractive. Meanwhile, I have so far been uninterested in second dates with the guys who got handsy on the first date.

I’m not sure how to communicate my hesitation to potential dates without making them think I’m weird. And in the back of my mind I’m also worried about the possibility that a guy who doesn’t try to make moves on a first date is really only interested in me as friends (this happened once), so I might be turning down guys who are actually interested in me romantically/sexually and falling for the guys who aren’t interested in me that way.

Sorry if this is confusing or sounds juvenile this is the first time I’ve actually tried to thing critically about my dating habits. I’m simply trying to figure out how to navigate the first few dates in such a way that I can find out whether I am actually attracted to a guy without inadvertently sending him the wrong signals.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,53137,public,self,Navigating initial physical attraction,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ok9wqn/navigating_initial_physical_attraction/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just feeling increasingly tired of it all. Tired of being alone, but also tired of putting in any kind of effort into dating, and then having that effort be all for nothing. 

I'm tired of making a connection, only to have them be painfully terrible at keeping a consistent conversation, or just disappearing entirely. I haven't made it out of the conversation/talking round in well over a year. I've almost forgotten what it's like to spend time with another adult that's not a family member or friend. 

I'm nothing special, but OLD just makes me feel even worse about myself. I swipe left on so many not because they aren't a match for me, but because I just don't think I'm good enough to be a match for them.

I have posted on a few different sites and receive little to no attention.  
I am relatively attractive (at least not an ogre), in good shape and share a bit of information on my profiles showing my intelligence level (not a genius, not a dummy). I try to let my humor show through along with my willingness to put forth effort.  I post my photos with no filters, I am truthful about who I am and what interests me etc.  
on other words, I think I put something genuine and what I think should be alluring, but I get nodda.  I try to initiate with women by writing on my likes to their profiles (I say more than just “hi,” but don’t write a novel).

I am at a loss as I feel I’m approaching this correctly.

I have always wondered why men (in my case) want to go to WhatsApp after a few messages. It didn't make sense to me. You are basically opening an app to send messages. Yes there might be an extra step in opening OLD messaging service but it doesn't justify going to another app. You can still get messages through the app. It's all text based, anyway.

The other reason I don't like going to WhatsApp is security. It's harder to block someone once they are in your phone. I remember a specific incident where I blocked someone on WhatsApp and SMS, only to find that I still had them in my contact list, when they appeared on Viber.

She'll give me shit, i.e. she's going to hang onto something I've said being (or acting, I don't know) all surprised ""Oh! I can't believe you just said that!"" kind of thing. For example, we'll walk by a shop window and notice a nice dress and will say something like ""I bet you'll look pretty good in that"" and she'll go ""wait, are you now imagining me in that dress? That's interesting.""

I don't want to constantly watch everything I say, I just want to relax and enjoy my time with her, sometimes I may make a comment on, say, what it says on her t-shirt and she'll smirk and go ""and pray tell, why were you looking down there?"" and won't let up. The problem is I'm feeling like I'm backed into a corner and say something like ""Oh, no, no, no, I didn't mean it like that"", feeling like I'm accused of something.

Once we get to know each other a bit, I think a woman will subconsciously test me to see how I react in certain situations and if I'm up to the mark for being a long-term partner that she can rely on, but I can't tell for certain between when she does that and when she's genuinely annoyed or surprised. When I do my retrospect post phone-call or date, I replay those conversations in my head and go ""fuck! I'm sure I turned her off by saying that."" I'd like to know which times she doesn't get offended so I can own up to what I say and tease her back.

I’ve done my research and I’ve collected a few different pictures that I can use for my profile. My hesitation? My face and upper body pictures look like me, no question - but as soon as I take those full body shots, I feel like an imposter. I’ve taken pictures myself using a timer and I’ve had friends take pictures but it seems that if my body looks true to life then my face doesn’t look like me - and if my face looks like me then my body looks off. The consensus among my friends is “yeah, you don’t look like that”. I’m not sure if it’s lighting or if the cameras aren’t using a proper focus point or what but I’m exhausted trying to get a decent picture! I have other pictures where I look “normal” but they all have my ex or my kids in them - and they can’t be cropped without looking ridiculous.

I’m not a fan of judging people by their looks and, for me, attractive is largely based on personality - but I know that is not how online dating is set up. If the current pandemic hadn’t greatly affected my ability to meet someone in real life, then that would be my preferred way to meet people. Until my area goes back to normal, online is what I’m working with.

We have a good and strong sexual connection. It’s been great, all aspects. Last week, laying in bed after sex, he made a comment that alluded to giving me an orgasm and punctuated it with some incredibly unflattering noises which is apparently what I sound like during sex. In that instant my heart just dropped and I think I went sheet white. I was mortified. He has made comments about closing windows and the neighbors will hear before and I thought he was being funny. I felt instant shock and shame and intense embarrassment. If I am not in love with this man I am very close, and he thinks I sound like an actual animal during sex. 

I know all people make less than flattering noises and I also know in these moments I was absolutely undone with passion and pleasure and was paying no mind to what I sound like. But this keeps playing on in my head. We have seen each other but not attempted sex since but when I have tried to masturbate, when I get close I hear that and it just disappears and all I feel is shame. I have a lot of anxiety about having sex going forward and I’m not sure how to relax and enjoy it again.

For a little context, I left a dead bedroom marriage and sex is absolutely a main priority to me in a relationship. I need to have an open and trusting sexual relationship to be happy. I need to be able to be vulnerable to really enjoy it and connect.

I do think he was being kinda insensitive but I don’t think he meant to hurt my feelings like that and I know I am sensitive which is not his problem at all. My emotional roller coaster is my ride, not his.

I don’t know what I want. Any funny stories to share? Advice to move forward? Thanks ya’ll.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,53219,public,nsfw,I’m so embarrassed,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/okzlrp/im_so_embarrassed/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently though, I've been seeing someone, and we've been out on 4 dates so far and I feel like I haven't been falling as fast as I have with some people (maybe that's a good thing).  Also, I feel like it has been hard to gauge her interest in me too, though it seems like she is.  She's a few years older than me, if that matters.

These are some signs I've thought she might not be very interested in me:

* She has mentioned a couple times that she has talked a lot.  I do tend to be an introvert and might not talk as much, depending on the person, but I have done some talking and shared some things about myself.  When she has said she's done a lot of the talking, it didn't sound like she was really complaining though, just something she noted.
* As far as communication between the times we've met up in person, it seems lately I've been the one to initiate texts; she does respond though, and sometimes she texts first.
* She hasn't been very flirty with me.  And from observing her body posture/language, I'm not sure yet how she feels about holding hands etc.  I'm not sure if it's just because she needs time to warm up or if it's a sign she's not very interested.

On the other hand, these are some signs that make me think she is interested:

* She has repeatedly mentioned seeing me again after our dates.  Also, a couple times after a date, she has said she enjoyed it
* Often it's common where I live for the guy to pay for dinner &amp; stuff, and she has let me pay rather than assuming I'd want her to pay for herself.  I know  this point might be debatable and some people can disagree on who should pay for dates, but it's just something I noted.
* We had a dinner date last night, and when we were leaving, she kissed me (normally we just hug).  It was a light kiss on the lips (though it wasn't full-on, it was more in the right corner of my mouth).  She then mentioned seeing me again this weekend and asked if I'd want to come watch a softball game with her.
* She has mentioned telling a couple people she's dating (and specifically used  the word ""dating"") and has said one of her friends wants to approve people she dates.  This might not mean much, but I felt like at least I'm not being friend-zoned.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,53223,public,self,Interest levels (and gauging a woman's interest level),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ol0clf/interest_levels_and_gauging_a_womans_interest/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Learned a ton here and thankful for everyone that participates!

Had a short relationship just end ( I'm more of the dumpee, but somewhat mutual)  It was about 7 months since we met, 4 or 5 months exclusive.   This was my first relationship after 20 year marriage,   we met 19 months after my separation ( 4 months after official divorce).  Overall it was a great relationship... until it wasn't  ( past 6 weeks or so?).   Probably not a great match overall as some of our weaknesses didn't mesh well together... but that's the way it goes.  I have some stuff to work on  - had a couple of screw ups that definitely didn't help.  Maybe this is a vent post as well.... breakups truly do suck.  I got a little ugly over a couple of things and that's not cool.

I thought I'd be in for a world of hurt, but I'm not?  Maybe because I realized a while ago this was not going to be long term.  Maybe because compared to the ending of my marriage this is nothing.  And  things never progressed that much relationship wise - good times -  saw each other a couple times a week from the start, no family enmeshment.

I won't be putting myself out there again at least August.  I'm not one to fudge things when asked either, if someone asks me about my last relationship I'll tell them how long and when it ended.

I have a good feel for what I look for in time passed since a longer marriage.  What's a good number that won't raise eyebrows for a shorter relationship like this?

As I started going through their profile, the pattern solidified, a couple of nice pics - good lighting and composition, but not overly professional, unverified, and each of them had an ""anthem"" (it's a quick setting to pick a song that feels like you).  A lot of them had the same anthem.  In fact between the 15 of them, there were only about 3 songs represented. Peaches by Justin Bieber is apparently a favorite of single professional women in their late 40s.

Several hours passed and I ignored the app.  I noticed 1 or 2 real likes in there (not interested).  At 7pm I decided to use my boost for 30 minutes of slightly increased visibility.  Again the popcorn starts popping - got about 12 new Likes in rapid succession.  Same deal - cute but not suspiciously stunning, age-appropriate, unverified profiles with shockingly similar taste in music.  And maybe 1 legit user (not interested).

I was tempted to Like them all to see what kinds of scams were in store.  Then I thought ""what am I doing with my life"", deleted my profile, canceled the subscription, and deleted the app.

For comparison's sake, I've been on *\[another app which I've redacted so you don't think this is an ad\]* for less than a week, am chatting with a few cool, interesting women, have been on one date with an agreement to go on another, and have two other first dates lined up.

Anyhow, Tinder is awful in my demographic.  Not only is it hard to find any mutual interest, the amount and effort of the scam-bots is kind of terrifying. And that's not even getting into the monetization side of Tinder.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,53307,public,self,Story time: 3 hours of Tinder Gold (52M),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/olpl7p/story_time_3_hours_of_tinder_gold_52m/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I haven’t been in a serious relationship in over 3 years. Was ready to propose, moved to a new state to be with her. We lasted a year after that, then I got dumped a few days before Valentine’s Day. Since then, my longest relationship has been about two months. 

I deal with some moderate mental health issues, and the loneliness really doesn’t help. I get treated for it, I exercise regularly…hell, I’ve been alcohol-free for almost two years. But, that red flag’s always going to be there.

I’m the last of my close friends left. All of them are married, or basically married. And here I am, striking out on OLD and in meatspace. The best I can hope for is a three-hour cup of coffee followed by weeks of conflicting schedules or radio silence. 

Every few months I get just enough confidence to set up a new profile online or put in a little more effort when I go out with those friends, only to delete everything a few weeks later and have a low mental episode.
