3,ms4ny0,1618584323,Advice or insight as to what the hell is going on?,"What the actual hell? So confused about the after math of this date.

Disclaimer: everyone in this story is vaccinated.

So, went on a lovely date with this guy (Thursday). I’m mid 20s he’s mid 30s. He pays, walks me to my car, we even reference potential future dates. He’s a really a genuinely nice guy. Has a very demanding career. He knows I’m going to be leaving for five months (I jokingly invited him for a weekend to visit).

Anyways didn’t get a text from him that night (which is what other guys do when I go out with them) and didn’t know what to think. Next day (Friday) went out with a friend at the same bar he and I went to the night before and he happens to be there and approaches us and says that we can join him and his two colleagues if we want! Super nice gesture. Didn’t even see him in the first place so he could’ve gotten away with not saying hi. I politely declined because we were headed out after our beer. Also how awkward I’ll pass no thanks no way Jose I’m not even comfortable around him let around his friends!

The next day I send him a text (Saturday) and say it was funny running into him and that we should get together when he’s back from being out of town for the weekend. I didn’t want him to think I wasn’t interested bc of me declining his invite. He responded and agreed.

Anyways he gets back in town Monday. Last night, Thursday, still haven’t heard from him. My friend who read our text said balls not in anyone’s courts so whatever I texted him and asked if he wanted to get together over the weekend. He responded a bit later saying sure what day and I responded etc. Then nothing! I know it’s still morning and all on Friday but what the f? I have a feeling he is going to ghost me and I’m just so confused.

Am I blind? He seemed so into me? Should I just flatter myself and tell myself he’s just worried of getting so attached before I leave because he likes me so much? God damn.....

Btw be nice plz because I’m new to this dating world! This is the first guy I had genuine excitement for since my ex so my heart hurts a little.

9,ms5fst,1618586567,Dating long (ish) distance?,"I've (26F) been dating this guy (30M), we live 1-1.5h away, both have demanding jobs, but we make it work. See eachother once every 1-2 weeks, sometimes 3 weeks. But when we do visit one another, we spend anywhere from 1-3 nights together depending on what our schedules allow. 

Lately though, I've noticed everytime I leave him, I get really sad because I know it'll be a bit of time before we physically spend time together again. We keep in contact when we're apart, but it's always the first 1-2 days after getting back from spending time together, I get bummed out. Once I get into the swing of work and my own life, things get better, but I hate having to deal with feeling this way every single time. 

Also for context, my last ldr was in college and I got these sad feelings too. They were def worse then because I was more immature, but it definitely took a toll on our relationship. This time, I really like this guy and I don't want to mess things up, so I've been trying to cope and deal with these feelings on my own. Anyone else get these feelings too? How do you cope?

10,ms5u68,1618587713,I just have to vent this out! I believe MOST guys share the same experience with me,"I have been rejected many times by women, the more you approaches, the more rejections you will face for a fact of life. 

If the woman is not interested romantically, I would really appreciate a clean, honest rejection. 

Sometimes, women do not say out right that she is not interested, she may say she is not looking to date anyone, or she is too busy right now. That is ok, we have come to understand this as a lack of interest.

What is worse is, when women shows you so much signs of interests and flirtations to lead you believe that you have a real shot, and then lead you on. That is totally sad and dishonest. 

I have a woman showing me signs of interests for so long consistently, turns out I came to concluded that she is not interested in me, as the bottomline is that, she won't go out on a date with me haha (not outright rejecting, but saying yes while never pinning down a date). She still show me all signs of interest like staring, touching ,helping me etc. Heck, If I don't set my head clear, I am gonna believe her for who knows how long. 

TLDR: I don't believe in signs of interests anymore. I believe in ask the girl out fast and stop fantasizing, I would rather know NOW whether I had a shot with her or not. 

If she doesn't give a clear yes with no strings attached. forget about her.

Over the past year, I’ve gone on a lot of first dates. I always respond if someone texts me after, no matter what, just to tell them I didn’t feel a romantic connection. 

Three times, I’ve messaged a guy, and I’ve not heard back. While it feels a little weird, I don’t really think of it as ghosting? Them not messaging me back IS the message that they’re not interested, right? 

I don’t understand why people find it so hurtful. I chalk it up to maybe something I said they found off, or that they didn’t think that we were a good personality fit, or whatever. 

To me, ghosting is when you date someone for more than two or three dates, and they totally disappear. At that point, they owe you an answer. But what does a person owe you after the first date? Out of these three guys, only one hurt me by not responding, but it was more because I felt rejected, not because I was confused.

17,ms690q,1618588855,Lately a lot of people on this page complain about getting a date but I promise you that you’re gonna be devastated without this piece of advice.,"**You should not date until you are able to fully commit yourself to NOT needing someone**

The day you are able to chuckle and say “yea having somebody would be cool but eh, the time will come,” is the day you are ready

This applies to men and women who either can’t land a date in person or from an app or haven’t been approached by anyone at all. 

**Work on bettering yourself. Please. Make yourself the person YOU would date and I know you’re gonna say “but I would,” but would you REALLY? Be honest with yourself.**

I know so many of you want to find someone so badly. I completely completely understand. I have been there. I used to cry many nights over the idea of never finding that person also. 

**You have GOT to love yourself before searching for someone else to bring in what you’re missing**

It’s only adding baggage to the next person’s back. Let’s be honest. I’ve been in your shoes. You want someone to fill a void in your life that you so desperately want to have or maybe you are infatuated with the idea of having someone and think all your problems will go away and life will be bliss. 

That’s not gonna happen. 

**I promise you what is gonna hurt you SO MUCH more is when you finally land a date and that person is incompatible or completely crappy. Whether it’s on the first date/no show or they cheat on you 3 months in or they just don’t take you serious at all or maybe they’re just careless and rude. This can all be as early as the first date or as late as 2 years in.**

Im not trying to come off as rude or toxic. I genuinely want you all to have the best life but needing/wanting someone is different than having someone. If that makes sense. 

What are you missing in your life? Search deeply for that. 

I don’t want to beat a dead horse but honestly find a hobby or do stuff with friends. 

Workout, crafts, hiking, trips. Anything. Fill that void of happiness in your life. You have got to face yourself and be the person you would genuinely date. 

Let’s remember, when this person comes into your life, it’s all butterflies and sunshine at first but you gotta care for this person constantly. Day and night. 4pm or 3am. 

The job is never either. Ever. Trust me. 

Im 22m tomorrow and have had a 2 flings and 2 girlfriends. One(4 months@17yo) was a disaster to my mental health and another one(3 years that ended recently) made me realize I deserve better. 

I found the gal of 4 months when I was desperate and thought I needed someone. 

**I found the gal of 3 years when I didn’t need someone and it was 3 years I wouldn’t trade but long story short, we were great short term but had complications and incompatibilities when facing long term stuff.**

I just want to share my opinion or advice. However you may see it. I know this page has animosity towards people who have landed dates or are currently in one.

It just depressing, when they always treat me like they see so much potential in me, just to reject me that soon. I always wonder if I did something wrong or don’t look good enough, even though I tell them my „flaws“ before and ask them not to build up such high expectations of me.

A while back my friend decided to set me up on a date. Haven’t been on one for quite a while since my ex and I split. She gave him my information and we started talking over social media. At this point it had been a week and things were going good. During the past few weeks I had been talking to other guys some of which led to friends others which we realized it wasn’t necessary to continue talking. In this case though things were going nice. We had some similar hobbies, he seems kind and considerate and we could  actually have conversations of substantial value not like the other guys I had talked to who would respond in a few words at times. He would ask me about how I was, about my job and my favorite games and in turn I did the same or about his hiking day trip. Honestly it was nice talking to me. Well this friend and I had a big falling out with way too much drama to last 10 lifetimes on crack and we aren’t at all connected anymore (she’s blocked on everything and I deleted all social media for a cleanse from all of this.. there were three people I am no longer friends with (all parties blocked) but she was the longest and the one that set this thing up). In her being friends with him and the reason we were talking I had told him something along the lines of “hey I’m sorry, I really enjoy talking to you and you seem like a caring person but ____ and I are no longer friends and a lot of drama came from it and I don’t want that to affect anything else” to which he responded with “yeah I don’t like drama”. I said something like “neither do I but since you guys are friends and her and I aren’t I think it’s best that we don’t communicate anymore. Can I ask why you seem mad or irritated at me?”. Well I deleted all social media accounts however when I did so there was still no reply from him. As I cared for me and still do (like I said) I only kept reinstalling this social media to check to see if he responded. Today I logged on and it said he did. It was snapchat so I could swipe and see his message w/o it showing as read and he said “I’m not mad or annoyed with you. I didn’t mean to come across that way. If you think that that best thing is for us to stop talking then what other choice do I have”.

Out of curiosity - and also to inflate my ego - I downloaded Grindr and turned my Tinder option to ‘looking for men’ and i was inundated with requests from guys for dates, hook ups, and everything else. This convinced me that I’m not THAT bad looking. 

From Grindr, a very convincing crossdressing man messaged me. He was very conventionally attractive, looked exactly like a girl, but was by all accounts a man and identified as one. 

I hooked up with him because he wasn’t unattractive and he was really into me and i’ve found myself having sex with crossdressing men when I’m in the mood and consider the unlikelihood of a woman hooking up with me, although a woman would very much do be my first choice. 

i know it’s a bit odd, but does that make me gay - if i’m only doing it because i can’t find sex elsewhere?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ms816x/straight_guy_had_sex_with_a_guy/
34,ms89yd,1618594574,"I feel like I'm never going to meet a partner, open to hearing advice, thanks.","To preface this story, ill say I'm a 30 years old organic cannabis grower in Colorado who spends a lot of time alone, I dont drink, and I'm starting to feel like I have a problem, or not starting to but have been thinking it for a while now, I havent had a girlfriend in years, havent really even been on a date in a couple years, and I am really bad at being myself when I'm around women I'm attracted to, like I just get nervous and don't flow like my normal self, I really just don't talk or have much to say. But what sucks is.. I also feel like I'm a cool person who's into all sorts of cool things like nature, psychedelics, camping, mountain biking, skiing, mushrooms, plants, art, being healthy, being mindful about how you carry yourself.  I am a humble person but I just feel like a girl would be happy to spend time around me if I could just be myself and let my guard down.

A friend said to me recently ""don't build things off false pretenses"" and that stuck in my head. I'm not into social media dating apps, it just feels inorganic and like I'm cheating nature and the universe. However, this same friend also has mentioned to me that I should meet one of his friends because she's kinda nerdy like me and he thinks that we'd get along. So I guess I naturally developed a bit of want/desire to get along with this person because my friend thought we might mesh. And thinking back to it..I feel like thats kinda false pretenses because I'm expecting to get along with someone because my friend thinks so. Anyway on to the story.

Last night I went to the friend's friend (the one he thinks I would mesh well with) concert to support her because she was singing and I hoped to maybe have some conversation with her after she was done and the opportunity for conversation was there, however I didn't really know what to say other than to congratulate her on the performance and tell her how I thought it sounded really good.  It was a club environment with loud music playing too, so that also, I feel, made it difficult for me to hear what people were saying, let alone carry on a conversation. I don't really go out to clubs or drink and am very introverted in my way of life so this environment wasn't really my type of place, I was also smoking a good bit of weed which turns me quiet but it gave me something to do.

I think what bums me out a lot is that I have had many, what I would consider ""potential"" opportunities to meet people and get to know them further, and I feel like I always drop the ball by not engaging well with said person or am unable to carry on a conversation, its like my mind goes blank, and in the end I go back home to my life alone, feeling like I failed or didn't try enough but when I'm in the moment earlier on, it felt so difficult to try.

Another thought that I have though too...a glass half full thought..is that maybe when I run into the right person that I mesh with...things will flow better and fall into place easier, I don't want to force anything that wasn't meant to be. But I feel kinda down, I guess partially because I had hope for a good interaction because my friend thinks me and his friend would mesh, but we havent really yet, I mean we've talked a bit and get along but It doesnt feel like theres something there to me, it just feels like I'm attempting to talk to someone because someone told me that they think we'd get along.  And overall at the end of these nights, its just another time in my life where I hoped for something to work out but it hasn't and I drive back home, alone and it bums me out because I just want someone to talk to about my life, ask questions there life, just someone to hangout with who's interested in me and I can be interested in them.

TLDR: I'm feeling down because Ive really wanted to meet someone to spend time with for years now but I've been alone for years and years now and every time I go out to try and meet people, I lack confidence or dont know what to say in the moment, it feels like a failed aspect of my life that I can't find a partner and im just overall, lonely.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ms89yd/i_feel_like_im_never_going_to_meet_a_partner_open/

38,ms8jm0,1618595356,Am I overthinking this situation with this guy I dated?,"Am I overthinking this situation with a guy I dated?

I broke up with a guy recently for reasons I won’t go into detail with this post. Basically, I wasn’t getting the same effort I was giving out. I also discovered he lied to me about where he attended university and what he studied, but I brushed it off as him trying to impress me and being insecure. He’s been so vague and kind of shady about a lot of things. Like, he didn’t even reply to my breakup texts. Could he have been scared I found something out?   

Today, I couldn’t stop thinking about him, and about how we might reconcile in future. I looked him up on Google. I came across an ancestry.com page which showed two records, one was his name with a weird middle name I’ve never seen before, and the other a random woman. They both had the same last name. I know his sister’s name and am pretty sure I know his mother’s name from what I’ve seen repeatedly pop up on Google. So this made me think, could this ancestry.com person be his ex wife or even a current one that he’s hidden from me? **For some reason I get this fear with every guy I date, that they had or have an ex-wife**. Also, it showed him as being born in a certain town where he told me he was born overseas. The woman was listed as being born in the same town. 

The guy also has a four year seemingly unexplainable work gap on LinkedIn, I can’t imagine what else he would have during that time. If this is true, and he were married previously and I didn’t know, I wouldn’t be able to bear it. That’s a huge thing to hide from someone you’ve dated a year. 

Am I overthinking this? I feel I have so much reason to doubt him, yet at the same time don’t feel as anxious or as nervous about him and about possibly figuring this out. Which I was with other guys I dated who acted shady.

44,ms99nr,1618597419,Bipolar Dating Experiences,"Just to keep this short, I had to leave my ex because I think she was bipolar. It sucked because I didn’t tell her but I loved her. But in my brain based on a few bad past experiences when we were dating I just knew it wouldn’t work out long term.
This was a year ago.
She’s with a new guy now and based on what I can tell they’ve been together for probably 7-8 months.
We were together for only 3 but she was honestly my first serious girlfriend.
I know I’m better off but just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences with a ex or maybe a current gf who had a few emotional outbursts (even in front of friends) and just overreacted to little things or would even act like they were texting someone else to make you jealous, and then when you fake it too they get act like they want to leave, only to relax when you say you are kidding and ask them how that felt.
I know I’m better off like I said. I was really good to her, and it just sucks. I know I just need to find someone else who is balanced but it’s just what I’m dealing with right now. She never had an official diagnosis of BIpolar Disorder that I know of but based on what I’ve read about it I think she had it big time. The link to alcohol being prevalent with BP disorder and how she’d get when she drank and her emotional outbursts and overreactions just ring a bell to me. If I was more prepared for what she had I might would have been able to at least understand better what was happening when it came to a head the last night she stayed over...

Just wondering if anyone else has any experiences with a bipolar woman.

For one thing, I'm short. Around 5'5"" to be precise, which limits my options significantly.

I tried using dating apps to try to find people, but those things proved to be the worst. No matter where I went, I could barely even get one person to even talk to me on these sites. I didn't know if it was my pictures or what (I don't have a lot of good pictures of myself or just pics of myself in general. It took me forever to learn how to smile for them and I don't have the energy to make more). Every girl eventually began to look the same to me because really, what was the point?

Not to mention, men are expected to make the first move, but how can I do that when they don't even talk to me? Plus I learn the best by actually doing things, which means that I would have to use several women as ""test subjects"" to develop my flirting skills. And on top of the moral repercussions that presents, it doesn't matter if I can't even talk to them.

I'm honestly at a loss and have seriously considered giving up on it forever. I mean, my life is a mess right now ever since Covid dropped. I couldn't handle the stress of both Covid and living on campus. (my parents even compared the isolation on campus to solitary confinement). And it's not like trying to find someone in person before Covid was working for me anyway.

It's time to face facts. For a neurotypical man, finding someone to date is hard enough. For me, a 5'5"", autistic person who's down on his luck, whose only interests include games and anime (a social tribe where most women hide themselves), and who can only really get better at flirting if he actually gets to practice it, it's absolutely impossible and not even worth trying.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ms9ip1/im_done_trying_to_date/

It seems like it's becoming a trend nowadays with lots of people seeing someone from another country. I (M, 32) couldn't even imagine that it would be my case one day.

&amp;#x200B;

It all still seems surreal to me. I've lived in the States almost all of my life and only moved twice from one city to another. I've never socialized with people that live outside the USA, so it has never occurred to me that there might be someone on the other side of the world who doesn't speak English, even though it's an international language.  

&amp;#x200B;

It all started when my girlfriend of 7 years broke up with me. We've been together through thick and thin and thought about starting a family together... and then one day, she said she wanted to move out. Apparently, she fell in love with someone. I was obviously distraught, so my best friend suggested taking a trip somewhere far away from home to get a clean slate, start from scratch. One of my friends joked about ""Bangkok Singles"" and that Thailand would be perfect for getting my rocks off. I thought: ""why the hell not?"" I've never done anything crazy in my entire life and felt like it was the right time to blow off some steam. 

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to take an unpaid leave from my job and went to Bangkok to teach English. I heard that Thailand was an affordable place for everyone.  I decided to spend some time there, so I applied to work as an English teacher and learn the local language along the way. I never thought that I would fall in love with one of my students so quickly and be bold enough to tell her that even though she barely understood what I was saying. She managed to tell me that she liked me back, so I invited her to be my guide and travel together around Thailand.

&amp;#x200B;

After I returned, I wanted to find a way for her to come to the US. We managed to apply for a visitor visa for her and spend Christmas together. That's the photo of us.

AITA for not wanting to date a woman at work whom I had chemistry with when she wanted to take it slow but proceeded to be with the “hot guy” instead?

Ok so pretty straightforward here , I work at a large hospital and I worked closely with a woman , let’s call her penny.   Penny and I instantly hit it off upon meeting.   Always had great conversations, similar sense of humor , and sought each other out to eat together or just hang out with when there was down time.   Weeks progressed and I asked her out on a date and she excitedly said yes.   We went out had a great time and at the end of the night we kissed.  It was fantastic!  Or at least it was for me, we spent the rest of the night texting about how great of a time we had and how we enjoyed the kiss.   So we go in a few  more dates and after a few weeks I think about asking her to officially date and be exclusive.    We have not had sex yet but we have kissed several times.   When I met up with penny again she seemed off and said she would like to take it slow and not rush into anything, she said she could see something amazing developing with me but wanted to be ready for this emotionally.   I said ok and backed off and just gave her space.    Over the next couple weeks penny basically ghosted me and started to be seen with a fellow co worker more.   Let’s call him Dave.   Dave is a good dude and I have nothing against him, admittedly Dave is a really handsome dude and has a great career and lots of money.  Ok so penny decided to date him instead of me , I get it I mean we weren’t serious and although it hurt my pride I was happy for her and him.   Well turned out Dave was going through a divorce and had no plans on being serious with penny, basically they were fwb and was planning on moving to another state soon ( hospitals can be gossip chambers ughh).   So I was having lunch at work and penny came and sat down next to me greeting me with a “hey stranger, how are you?”    We had some small talk and that’s when she says “so hey , I have been thinking about you a lot and I miss you.   Can I take you out for dinner sometime this week?”    I laugh and ask how Dave is doing and if he would be having dinner with us ?    She went on about how she realized we were a better fit and how he was just a fleeting lust because he was so hot.   I thanked her for the offer but said I don’t want to be anyone’s plan b or backup plan.   I picked up my lunch and walked away.   Part of me wishes I had given her another chance but I just felt like a safety net and not her choice.

Today she went to work. She wasnt as cuddly in the morning but thats okay. This evening she comes back and i thought we were gonna hang out play games chill. I wasnt be super touchey but then after eating she said she felt very sleepy so she said im going for a nap. A nap for 8 hours more like. She used her work alarm which is like 7am.

Anyway not sure what to do. Ive travelled all this way ,k,3 hour journey. Im pissed since im only her for two nights and tonight seems like a write off. Not sure how to feel. I dont think i was too touchey today at all. She even jokingly rode me and rubbed me. All i did was massage her feet which she liked and went for a kiss ,(where she gave me the cheek treatment) but yeah. Dunno. I talked about sex a tiny bit. Am i being paranoid?

Advice?,"I went out with a guy yesterday who is super hot, buff, etc. We went to dinner which was a bit awkward, but he seemed to be putting in an effort to talk about each other’s lives. He didn’t compliment me once though. At the end of the dinner he walked me to my car and asked if I wanted to go to back to my place or his. I told him we’re not going back to each other’s but I would happy to grab a drink with him. We went to a bar and talked for over 3 hours. Everything appeared to be going fine. We mirrored each other’s body cues and like touched knees and stuff. He did pull away when our legs touched for longer than a minute though. I put my leg over top of his leg and he awkwardly slapped his hand on my knee. He asked me where do we go from here and I told him whatever he wanted. He then told me he was tired, but he was down to continue hanging out if I wanted to. Obviously, I didn’t want to continue the date after he said that! So I told him that we can go and he walked me to my car. I gave him a punch on the arm and told him that I had fun. He asked for a hug and I gave him one. He didn’t try to kiss me or anything like that, but I didn’t try to kiss him either. I tried to flirt with him and he just got flustered and didn’t flirt back. He wants to go out again and I may give him another shot because he is super sweet. Idk, I’m kind of disappointed that he didn’t make a move or flirt with me.

71,msdcwi,1618609729,She's gone completely cold since I've backed off,"So there's a girl I have mixed feelings about.  We work together but remotely. I used to hit on her a bit, paid her compliments, but never sexually escalated my messages with her. I felt a spark but felt she wasn't going anywhere in life: she's in her early 20s, lives at home with her folks, has no desire for college, mediocre with her hobbies, wants to be a housewife but doesn't know how to cook and bake, wastes hours on tiktok and YouTube, claims be social but hardly has friends she talks to. 

Our hands touched during the one date we had, and she even slipped a pet name (heard her call me baby and thus made me feel that spark). I paid for us during the 1st date (she initially wanted to split the bill), and she was so enthusiastic about a 2nd one until I mentioned her getting me next time (I wanted her equally invested). She became a little flaky but we still chatted nonetheless. However she became more distant the more I pulled back: I stopped calling her beautiful or using creative nicknames, I hinted at dating other girls (mentioned a date as a ""female friend"" on a social media post to NOT come off as too available), and lastly since we talked about dating on the phone before the date, afterwards I made a meme poking fun at people who rush in to try to backtrack on what we talked about to not come off desperate. 

Anyways these last 2 weeks the times we did talk were strictly work related and she was brief and quick.. I'm not sure what to do because despite me feeling mixed, I can't take my mind off her and deeply wish I could pick up where we left off and naturally progress this into a relationship. She's super sweet with a lot of moral values that I'm looking for despite some of her short comings.

I look back and the truth is the girls I knew were always dating a guy at a higher status level than they were currently at. In middle school, girls dated that weird dude in high school. In high school, they dated the guy that just graduated. In undergrad I don’t even know what they did because none of them wanted to have anything to do with me. In medical school they dated residents.

So I imagine in residency they’ll probably date an attending physician or a rich financial adviser or something. Yet again, I’m probably not gonna have a shot.

81,msf8qb,1618615678,I feel so manipulated,"I (30F)have been seeing someone (34M)for four months, and the chemistry was movie-level. I get along pretty well with most of my dates, and for the first couple of hours I found him a bit cold.  I was planning to politely end it after dinner. To my surprise, he warmed up quickly, and even ended up telling me that he “felt like we had known each other our whole lives.” It was cringe, but I kind of felt the same way so I let it slide.

We ended up getting along well, and he told me he was leaving the city in a year and didn’t want to do long distance. I then told him that I wanted to do something casual, rather than something half-assed and messy, and he was genuinely so sad and heartbroken, so I decided to give him a chance. He told me he “couldn’t bear to give up on us.”
He is leaving to work in another country, and even asked me if I would consider working there someday. He reached out consistently, kissed my forehead, gave me massages, and really seemed to care about me. We’d spend hours just talking about life.

Then he goes weeks without so much as contacting me- when I contact him now he only gives half-assed answers. I figured it was because, as he said, he was protecting himself from getting hurt. We had tried to end it once, and that didn’t even last a day. I thought he really did care about me. 


I was sooooo fucking wrong. I feel embarrassed for myself. I am ashamed about the level of stalking I had to go through for this, but he’s been playing around in LA with a girl for the last 2.5-3weeks.  I don’t know if they’re friends and we’re not exclusive so it doesn’t even matter, but I’m so hurt by this. He told me he’d see me soon, then he drops off the face of this planet to stay at this girls house for weeks??!??! 


He’s given me wayyy too much time to think. I think about the time he hit me in bed without asking, the way he asked me to cook him dinner the night after a very important proposal he KNEW stressed me out, how much he has left me confused- and I realized he didn’t ever actually care.

THEN WHY PRETEND? WHAT IS TO BE FUCKING GAINED? sex? We were already doing that and I ASKED FOR IT TO BE CASUAL TO AVOID THIS SHITSHOW. Now I’m super hurt and am having trouble maintaining self respect as I let myself get bamboozled by this king dick.

In truth, I don’t hate him, but I am hurt. I’m left with all these pleasant memories, like of him stroking my hair while my head is on his lap, him reassuring me that I am a smart woman who will change the world for the better, only now they have the bitterest aftertaste.

We live together . I think we have an amazing relationship , our connection is really strong and we love each other very much . However there is some little things that make me insecure or doubtful. 

I have always suffered what it seems to be emocional dependence or co-dependence, not sure which one . But all my past relationships  am always the more dependent on the other for happiness. The difference with this particular relationship is that I have no doubts this is the man I want to spend the rest of my life with, therefore since I have been working on my self to not loose him although I think he has his flaws too to work on like any other human being. 

Situation: It kind of stupid but it affects me deeply. So I get a lot of negative and fearful doubts of abandonment for the smallest things. For example: He works 8 hr everyday Mon-Fri . Before he used to text me all the time because his job is not that busy its kind of chilling. But he has gradually stop texting me or texting me less. He rearly text first , its almost always me who texts him , and ultimately he replies within hours. In conclusion he texts back around 2-3 times in those 8hrs . 

Although i have a lot things to do to keep my mind bussy I get distracted when I remember he hasn’t reply and I get anxious with negative thoughts since I was so used to him texting me all the time. I start thinking that there might be a girl at work who is taking his attention or flirting. Also , bc of my co-depence I have made him wanna break up with me in the past which is why I started changing. And I have to say it has been successful since then everything went back to normal. He is really sweet , loving , he expresses his love for me all ways but he has this days out of the blue that I never expect, When he doesn’t text, or is serious, walks around the house without talking to me , i get the fear of “what if he wants to breakup again” although that was a long time ago.
Also concerns me that sometimes we nearly talk all day although we live together , and sometimes he gets home not in the mood to talk or anything , and I don’t want our relationship to get cold or distant 

We have talked already . He says that is normal bc we live together he doesn’t need to talk to me at work because he will see me when he gets home. This doesn’t stop my negative thoughts . Am very open to him but When I ask him questions about his mood swings he doesn’t like it and seems really annoyed by me asking. Unlike me (am very patience with his flaws) he is not very understanding and has little to no patience. 

Although am more dependent , am more mature too , he acts like a little girl sometimes and dramatizes everything, turns almost anything into a confrontAtion , so I don’t want to make this a fight.
Is there anything I can do to make him be with me like before? Are my thoughts accurate with his actions or should I work on myself? Any advice helps

Finding a rebound is a bad idea in my opinion, it feels good to get your mind off your ex but its kind of like a dead end, like your trying to fill that breakup void/ hole in your heart. You need time to heal, and focus on yourself is the what I wish I knew 6 months ago, now that I realize instead of going on pointless dates with people on the dating apps that I know will go nowhere but waste my time and money, or pointless one night stands. I've decided instead to focus on work, dreams/goals, getting healthier. Not turning to booze or vices to cope with the break up, that just numbs the pain and makes you avoid having to deal with the breakup emotionally and move on and better yourself. When the right time comes you will find a person that connects on your level and has also built they're love for themselves that they have a lot of extra love to give you and you can benefit each other by building one another and helping reach person goals and even the same dreams you both share.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/msfref/my_advice_on_moving_past_a_break_up_and_bettering/

I live in Virginia and am having trouble finding local matchmakers, not large nation-wide companies. specifically in Virginia Beach/Norfolk/Portsmouth/Hampton/Chesapeake areas. Does anyone know of a good way to find them?

Unfortunately I am not having a lot of luck on online dating apps, and approaching people out of the blue on the beach or in the mall feels odd.

Any other advice would be good too.

I am 27(M), and have focused exclusively on my education/career/wealth/fitness for my adult life so far. Never actually been in a relationship. But now that I'm happy, nearly financially free (through a 6 figure job and several investments that have paid off exponentially), and fit, I'm having issues finding someone. I am quite short though at 5'5, don't care about height but many do. I have been told by many that I am above average to handsome, and look a bit like Elijah Wood if he had overall sharper features and was a bit more muscular/stocky build.

My only real dealbreakers are smoking cigarettes, single mothers, and at least average fitness.

(The information above is just to give a frame of reference as to where I am at in life so you guys can accurately inform me as to what you believe the best course of action I can take is, or if you know/can find any matchmakers that can assist me)

please help, this is getting bad.

Hi everyone, 
So i really need some good sensible advice. I have been dating my boyfriend for over a year now. we are both in college. we planned a future out together and i would really love to keep him in my life. However there are ALOT of issues. First of all he has severe chronic depression, anxiety, and struggles with thoughts of suicide regularly. He has tried to take his life in the past and he has cut himself several times. This all comes from his family and how he was raised and grew up. His family is Indian and wealthy, I used to have a decent somewhat relationship with them before i actually saw what went on in that family. The father is on drugs, cocaine, smokes weed basically everyday and is on so many different mental drugs, antidepressants, bipolar meds, he is basically a fucking mess and should really be in rehab. He once left his stash of coke in my boyfriends car that  him and i were driving so we literally had to pull over at a pharmacy and throw it out in the first trash can we saw. His mother is a lawyer and is extremely manipulative, controls her children with money but is never actually really present. She has punched my boyfriend in the face and screamed at him with me in her home( this was on his birthday this past year). i began to realize this family was putting on a front at first for me but i began to see the alcoholism, the drugs, the abuse after time. The cops have been called to their home several times and a lot of the time i was there all there was was screaming and yelling. the marriage is non existent yet the mother refuses to leave the husband for some reason (i think it is because of money). regardless she controls him and forces him to come home to all of this. We live close to 3 hours away. she recently had a huge ordeal with me freaking out because i refused to ever step foot in that home again( i would hide in the basement bc i was literally terrified for my safety and well being) and also because i do not want to chat with her over the phone and pretend eveythjng is fine. she did not take this well and told my boyfriend that she does not support this relationship that i am controlling and domineering blah blah blah saying she wouldn’t pay his college tuition. Nevertheless I told my boyfriend that because he struggles so badly with his mental health ( he will not see a therapist bc he thinks he can’t be helped) that i don’t want him going there. every time he goes there he comes back negative and cursing and just overall a different person. it seems as if every time he is making progress with his life and mental health is it setback by going there. He is on antidepressants bc of this and it concerns me that he will have to live the rest of his life this way being submissive to his toxic extremely abusive family. He seems to be in denial and just defends his family especially his mother. he seems to have some twisted obligation towards her probably because the dad is a deadbeat and she makes all the money. I once called her as a last resort bawling over the phone because i had caught my boyfriend cutting himself and she simply told me “ thank u for bringing this to my attention he will obviously have to seek professional help” and that was the fucking end of that. she did not even care and simply moved on with her life. I told him i don’t want these people in my future i can’t be surrounded by the drugs and abuse manipulation and greed. i simply won’t settle for a life filled with that. i fear for my future children and myself having to visit or having money held over our heads. I don’t want to live surrounded by this hostile angry unloving environment and i don’t want my children to grow up how my boyfriend did. I told him this has to stop he has to cut them out this is unhealthy and he will never be able to focus truly on himself and being happy and forming his own life and family. Some sort of weird cultural thing about them being indian seems to not care about how deep the problems are or what is going on as long as they are “family” that’s all that matters. i think he feels guilty and also scared of drawing some lines frankly because he is a really kind guy who doesn’t deserve all this and also bc he will have no one in the case that we don’t work out. also money he will have no money. i really need some good advice here because i cannot continue this way. I would really  appreciate any help thank you 🥺",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/msgus1/psycho_family_please_help/

96,msh8dw,1618622840,Bumble experiment made me depressed.,"Did a bumble experiment using this Mr Olympia dude juiced up on steroids called Chris Bumstead. Put up a bunch of pictures of him and in minutes I was swarmed with women wanting to fuck. Literally matched with like 50 women in 30 minutes it was ridiculous. This is the kind of guy I’m competing with and what women really want. A 6’0 super super handsome guy juiced up on steroids with an impossible physique to obtain. Makes me depressed because I know even if I do get a girl, she’ll always greatly prefer some guy like this dude. No wonder most guys don’t have success on dating apps, because it just takes a few tall built handsome guys to “horde” all the women.

I look at myself in the mirror and think what’s the point. Being settled on hard for my looks sounds depressing to me and with my looks/body that’s the best I could hope for...",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/msh8dw/bumble_experiment_made_me_depressed/
97,mshc9f,1618623240,How do I make a coffee date feel less like an interview?,"I just went out on a coffee date, and I really liked her.  The thing is we mostly kept talking about our jobs / interview type of shit.

We were legitly talking about doing our taxes.  I think I blew it since how tf can chemistry build under those circumstances?

It’s hard not to be nervous on the first date.

So how do I make a date feel less interviewy?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mshc9f/how_do_i_make_a_coffee_date_feel_less_like_an/
98,mshhyw,1618623845,I’ve dealt with a bunch of emotionally abusive people in my life (my therapist’s words). Maybe that’s enough of a reason to avoid kids and relationships,I thought I wanted both. But maybe that wouldn’t be best. Maybe it could turn out well. But it could also not turn out well. Sometimes people are just shitty towards other people. And some people sometimes get taken advantage of over and over again. I feel like I’ve been like that. I’ve finally escaped and come to terms with lots of shit I’ve been through and feel like I’m at a point where I can mostly trust society again. Maybe I should not switch things up now when it could end up moving me back to where I was before. Maybe I should just do my own thing,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mshhyw/ive_dealt_with_a_bunch_of_emotionally_abusive/
