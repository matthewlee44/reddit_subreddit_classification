I eventually summoned the courage to ask him out by saying “Wanna go out for drinks with me on _____?” After he asked me what I was doing for the weekend (I asked him the same and he said nothing, which is when I asked him to go out). I usually never ever ask ppl out, cos I do consider myself more reserved, and um hello they could say no and my ego just can’t T^T But we would flirt all the time, break the touch barrier and he even opened up to me about some stuff he said he doesn’t really talk about. It really seemed like he was interested in me too. So, I mustered up the courage to ask him. He said yes, and when we got off I told him to text me about that day so we could make more definite plans, he said he definitely would. The reason why stood up is in quotations is because we never actually made the plans, cos we were working at the time, so i don’t know if it’s technically considered being stood up. The weekend comes and goes with no text or call or anything from him. (I wanted to text and ask if we were still on but, last and first time we texted after he asked for my number, he never responded n I didn’t wanna like overwhelm him?) Anyway, I was just gonna pretend like nothing happened, and just treat him like another coworker. Still cordial, but definitely not the same as before. Which was difficult because, honestly, I do find him really funny, and don’t usually stay mad for long. When we worked together afterwards, he kept asking to do me favors, trying to open me up to have super random conversations, or making a lot of jokes, even after I didn’t laugh at most of them, or walked away every time he approached me, and honestly, just pretty cold to him. I could just sense that he felt guilty (could be a projection). Like, he would stare at me from afar, try to smile or be silly, and I would stare back blankly when usually I match his energy. This only served to make me even more annoyed/confused cos why not just come out and at least acknowledge it? When we were alone for a moment he said he would to come visit me on my shift the next day (my response was a monotone “ok”) even tho he wasn’t working, and he did actually show up, and I made him a coffee. I was still cordial to him, but still pretty cold, not on purpose but I’m still feeling really annoyed by the situation.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about two years (with about a 4-5 month break in the middle). I love him very much and I am so happy that we reconciled after a breakup that left me broken. Being apart from him helped me realize that I loved him and want to be with him.

When we were together the first time, he was really respectful about cutting off his ex gf when I asked. He respected my wishes and he unfollowed her from social media etc. When we broke up I moved out of his house and back in with my family for a bit. He works a sales job and doesn’t make any money if he doesn’t do well and gets his sales in. After reconnecting with him I found out that he had reached out to his ex gf during our break up and asked her to let him borrow money to pay for rent and groceries. He said he was really distraught when I left and he wasn’t able to focus on work. 

She let him borrow money and he says that he will never stop talking to her because she was his friend during that hard time. I understand that she helped him out and I do feel terrible about the whole situation. However, I think his communication with her is a little too much. He reaches out to her a lot, regarding our relationship (getting things back to a good place has been hard) and his job and sales goals etc. They seem… really close. And it does bother me a lot. It makes me uncomfortable.

my (23M) boyfriend of (off and on) 4 years and i (21F) recently got back together in July after 6 months of being broken up when he reached out to me and wanted to give it another try. 

we originally broke up because he just simply didn’t respect me and we fought every single day. (why did i think it was a good idea to get back together???) 

well. yesterday night, he was sleeping and i had a very strange gut feeling telling me to look through his phone. and i am not the type of girlfriend who ever does that kind of thing, so having this feeling was very strange to me. 

well. i grabbed his phone and started looking, and sure as shit. his search history was filled with “live cam sex” “live cam porn” etc. so as if it wasn’t bad enough that he was going on live cams with other females and beating his meat to randos on the internet. he took it so far as to MESSAGE THEM ON SOCIAL MEDIA AFTERWARDS. 

and the REAL kicker, is that at 12:37 am he messages this girl “heyy :) you’re very pretty” and at 12:42 am he messaged me the whole “goodnight I love you and miss you and I can’t wait to see you tomorrow”

i am filled with rage and disgust. four fucking years i wasted. four fucking years.  i know it’s my fault and i never should have continued to take him back but i cannot help but to be filled with such anger and hatred. 

once i saw this, i immediately woke him up and made him bring me home. did not tell him what i saw. then once i was back home he saw that i had sent myself a screenshot of all the messages he was sending to the girls off his phone and messages me with the whole “I love you so much I regret ever doing this! This was the only message I’ve ever sent I promise! You can go through my phone everytime we’re together please don’t leave me I can’t live without you!!” 

such a disgusting fucking joke. words cant even explain what i feel inside.

So!

We made out for an entire DJ set. 
It was STEAMY. 
Swapped numbers. 
Texted him the next day to ask if he enjoyed another set I went to. 
He said he’d gone home by then, ‘lovely to meet you’. 
I said he missed out and that it was lovely to meet him too. 

Which I take is a ‘thanks but no thanks’ (BUT I ALSO suspect he’d have been on a hideous come down, as I was / also why bloody give me your number the day before then? Weirdo)

AND THATS IT.

Do I bother with a Hail Mary ‘fancy a pint’ nonsense? It’s not everyday you have a steamy make out session with a hot stranger (I’m not hideous myself)
If so, how do I approach it?
Or do I just leave it? If he was interested in going for a drink/hooking up, he’d have texted, right?

Women who say they will wait before having sex with a date because they've been used for sex in the past and then 838484 of commenters guilt tripping them saying its not going to work etc.

Here's the deal. A lot of men on OLD are just out to get laid. It has never been easier than today to get laid as an average man. Before OLD, men had to have social skills and court a lady to bring her home. In todays dating world, a man doesn't even have to have good social skills to get laid. Because of that most men aren't looking for long time relationship or to 'settle down'. Why settle down when you can get cheap sex around the block?

Since most men put in the least amount of effort to court a woman, they won't be around for more than a couple of dates without sex before they move on. If they can't get sex from a certain woman, they'll just move on to the next woman. Its a numbers game. A woman deciding to wait more than a couple of dates before having sex will weed these men out since they won't be staying around waiting go get with a woman they don't really like.

So to any woman getting guilt tripped for waiting with being intimate, don't. You have nothing to lose by waiting. In fact there's just benefits to it.

I don’t have complete evidence of her “cheating” but the situation is pretty suspicious. She constantly whines to me about “some guy” that (in her words) “keeps asking for nudes”. My response was always “idk, block him?”

Then she’d come up with an excuse like “it’s funny”

I’m finally to my boiling point especially after a friend of mine suggested that she’s probably cheating. Now I’m wondering “Hmm, it’s a bit weird she continues to chat with a guy who clearly wants something from her?”

btw, she’s known this guy for like 2-3 years or so.(She knows him in real life) According to her he’s been asking for nudes since we started dating(she always mentions him)

Today, I texted her “I feel like you may have sent nudes to that guy, not saying it’s true but that’s how I feel.” She says “You really think I send pics to other guys? You probably send nudes to other girls, am I complaining?

I completely denied it and she continued to insist that I did. The blame got switched on me really quick. Plus, what did her statement mean anyway? Sounded more like she admitted to doing it then tried to place blame on me.

I literally don’t understand anything she said especially the “am I complaining” part, like what? Lol.

I have constantly brought this up but she never does anything about it(I guess I have to now) Like that one time where she “claimed” she didn’t talk to the dude, then how else does he ask for nudes? Lol. She talks to him like every 2-3 weeks btw.

I then replied “To be honest I know that you will talk to him eventually” She said “Keep acting like this and I will.” This whole situation makes me feel like she cares about him more than me.

She then implied I was trying to call her a degrading name(can’t say it here, but it’s basically someone who sleeps around while in a relationship) after that she got mad about it.

She would lose her shit if she caught me sending nudes because she didn’t even want me hugging a girl other than her.

Yesterday I told him I was starting to develop feelings for him and asked if he felt the same. His answer was pretty vague, no direct yes or no, mentioned “you’re very interesting to talk to but I’m not very talkative and bad at communicating online” he also mentioned he “wasn’t prepared for something too serious” and “if you’re not ok with this I won’t waste your time” 

I’m not rushing to be exclusive because I think it’s too early but I just want to know if there’s a possibility for it in the future. 

So I asked if he still wanted to continue talking to which he said yes. I don’t know if I should stick around and see how things go or end things now?

I spend most weekends at his place as we typically aren’t able to meet up during the week due to commitments. (he has a 8 year old son (that stays with other family during the weekends). I still live with my parents, and I have uni and family commitments). He’s been an absolute gentleman from since I met him, he’s made me realise what it’s like to be with a more mature man and has made me feel happy and special which helped a lot during these pandemic and otherwise uncertain times too. I assume it probably comes with time passing in a relationship, but we don’t text every day now, now sometimes two days even pass by without any communication even though we used to text a lot and he used to try calling me quite a lot too. I usually wait about two days but I can’t wait more before I get anxious, and I text him something or, he ends up texting me something. After two days it’s like sweet, he usually sends me hearts and being all sweet so it doesn’t suggest he’s disinterested or something. Then I get reassured. We spent last night and most of today at his place, cause it’s uncertain whether we can meet up this weekend for some personal reasons. I had work yesterday then went over to his, it was a really great evening together with some alone time we craved. Yesterday he said he said he can’t wait to see me. Today was good too, we watched movies all day, and cuddled on the couch. He’s always really affectionate but as I was trying to put my head on his shoulder and hold his hand like usual he kept saying at some point “he feels too hot for that right now.” After that I think he felt bad or saw the disappointment on my face and put his hand in my lap, saying okay you can have my arm though. I kinda chuckled awkwardly but I felt sad and terrible. It felt weird to just sit there next to each other not holding hands at least but I felt stupid for wanting to and then the feeling of being turned down by him just felt too awful. Before the movie he asked me how long I’d like to stay before I need to go back home cause we realised earlier I can’t stay over two nights even though we could have, as my dad’s having surgery tomorrow and I have to help my mum at home for a little while while he’s at hospital. I told him til about 7pm. He said ok, shall we watch another movie? I had a feeling he’s rushing me home? During and towards the end of the second movie he kept picking up his phone to look at some car stuff as he wants to buy a car in a few days and seemed preoccupied. He reached out for my hand a couple of times and smiled at me but I still felt overlooked for some reason. As soon as the movie was over he was like, I’ll get you an Uber to the station (as usually he drops me back there but he doesn’t have a car right now). He literally went to order one as soon as we stood up from the couch after the movie. Then he saw that I wasn’t even dressed yet so he’s like I’ll let you get dressed and stuff haha. I went to the bathroom and picked up my belongings from his room but I was already struggling to fight back tears and didn’t want him to notice them. Then when the Uber came in like 1-2 minutes we stood at the door and I told him I loved him and we touched lips briefly before he gently directed me out the door for Uber was there. He said “I’ll talk to you soon but nowadays after we see each other I often don’t hear from him for like 1-2 days where earlier it was typical of him to message me or even call me often hours after.

I had my first girl friend in college (3 year relationship) and we broke up about seven months ago. Hardly talked at all after the break up, but started talking again earlier this summer. In talking we tried to rekindle the relationship, but the past few weeks it became clear the relationship was going no where. Yesterday I made the decision that we should stop talking all together.

Feel like I wasted these past few months, although I was technically ""single"" I definitely did not feel the need to meet other girls because I was talking to my ex girl friend. There are reasons for hope, I am moving out of my parents home to a new city and will have ample opportunity to meet women. 

In talking to friends, I feel like the most common way to meet girls at my age is meeting them out or the dating apps. I have doubts that these methods will work for me. Although I have some attractive qualities, I have a receding hair line. I understand that this is a massive turn off, especially considering how young I am. I realize this may not be the biggest deal, but really hurts my confidence

I personally think the best angle I can take is meeting girls through mutual friends, probably out at a bar at a party. Think this is best because I do not have to go up to a random individual, I am talking to someone that I have something in common with. I have never been the smoothest in talking to girls. I feel like I can be funny/nice, but really have no clue if the girls is interested in me or not. Due to this I have history of never making a move. I think I'm just insanely scared of being rejected.

Anyway, I was looking for advice- maybe there are better places to meet women at this age. Along with this, maybe there are things I can improve on as a person- get over my insecurities and be more confident in myself. Or maybe there are even talking points I should try to focus on when I meet new people out.

She went on to tell me that all those things can be done alone and it’s unhealthy to want a significant other and I should just want to be alone. 

I am so confused.

I have been extremely alone other than having my children half the week and briefly speaking to coworkers during the day (remote working). 

I don’t want random hookups and want a real connection but from how she shamed me it’s made me feel like there’s something wrong with me for wanting to have a life partner to grow old with and enjoy life with. Is she implying that all relationships and marriages shouldn’t exist and we should all be off on our own? I just don’t get it at all.

Relevant sidenote: Her friend was a supervisor at this job and me and the friend had a couple arguments at work. Never disrespected each other. It was mostly just miscommunication and weird stuff and we apologized to each other both times. When I saw the girl I liked after some of this stuff had happened she was less talkative. Acting way different and less excited to see me. But that could have been for other reasons. At the time I thought maybe she was stressed or she wasn’t single anymore but I didn’t know for sure. 

Anyways me and the girl I liked never matched but I went to the page where you can see likes you’ve already sent.

- They don’t seem to be really interested in sex? Most guys I dated before comes back or keeps in touch for more sex but the guys I met they didn’t seem as much interested. They do get excited at the moment but recurring sex doesn’t seem to hold their attention.

- Because they don’t get excited about sex it is hard to tell if they are interested. Some of them try to connect more by talking and others by trying to do activities together.

There are definitely pros and cons. I am more sensitive to sex appeal so I like it when guys are turned on or become more excited about physical aspect..so with these guys it’s been hard to gauge whether they are really interested in seeing me further. Also one of them ghosted me after sex which was a shock to me because most guys I met in late 20s always wanted more. Since I usually don’t want serious but casual/semi-casual (fwb), this always worked out but looks like guys in 40s are not looking for that..then I was wondering what they really want.

So basically even though I’ve been out of school for a few years, i haven’t had any romantic success. I’m still young obviously, but have had unrequited crush after unrequited crush, fell really hard for my best friend for a long time, had other little flirtations after that that went nowhere, not really much attention apart from that, etc. It’s been getting to the stage recently where, while I’ve worked on myself to be more confident, put romance to one side and focused on myself, and really tried to just sort my life out in other areas, I noticed I hadn’t had a thing for anyone like I used to. Even though it tended to go nowhere, I did enjoy that kind of drunk infatuation feeling you get. I hadn’t felt that in a couple of years by now, and I felt like maybe all the rejection and failed attempts had made me too guarded to fall for anyone. The idea of even dating just didn’t appeal to me; I didn’t go near dating apps for months because it felt like a useless chore, I didn’t have any interest in anyone and honestly kind of made peace with the idea I might never find anyone who I’m attracted to who feels the same, and was honestly okay with it. It kind of was weird to me that I had closed that side of me off, but it was what it was. 

Anyway, a few days ago I matched with a girl on tinder. I remembered scrolling past her before we matched, because I genuinely done a double take because she’s exactly my type. And then we matched. And then she messaged first. And we’ve been talking all day every day since, I’ve barely put my phone down. I’ve got her socials, we’ve been joking about dates, we have loads in common, we’re at similar points in our life, she’s ridiculously smart and funny, etc. It’s been a long time since I’ve had that feeling of sitting on my phone, smiling to myself while texting someone, and I can’t remember a time someone I’ve been this attracted to has shown such genuine interest in me.

And it’s really early days. We barely know each other. Maybe it will fizzle out, maybe we won’t even make it to that first date, or a million other things could go wrong. But it’s nice to know I still have it in me to be infatuated with someone like that, and to know that it is entirely possible for women I’m very much attracted to to be attracted to me too.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1020676,public,self,Things are going really well with a tinder match and it’s so nice to know I’m still able to become infatuated with someone,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pt9qfi/things_are_going_really_well_with_a_tinder_match/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

Sorry, this may be a post which is not usually on the topic of college subjects, but I’m a junior in College, and ik I have a year left, but I was just wondering if you guys thinks it’s weird if I graduate and not have any dating or relationship type experiences in the 4 years I’m at college. I just keep thinking how I’ll be around the most girls ever in my life, as I’m literally on a college campus with them everywhere, and if I don’t meet “the one” or let alone get any dating experience in college I’m weird and kinda fucked. The reasons why I haven’t kinda contribute to it too, I’ve been really stressed about career stuff for awhile and was just grinding school/club exec positions/internships/research to build up a good resume, and I had friends, but through all that there just was never time for me to meet girls or go on dates and what not. I’m also a stem major so my classes always take up so much time.

Ik that’s just me making excuses, but is it weird as a guy for me to go through 4 years, never get into a relationship, never have the first kiss, lose virginity, or really experience any sort of romantic endeavors as a 20-21 yo male in college?

Because of this, hookups or casual engagements have been the main form of relationship for me. 

I recently moved to a new city which I plan on staying in for a while and have really made strides in my personal life which has lead me to feeling pretty good. About a month ago I went on a date with a girl my age who I met on Tinder. I fully anticipated this to be the same Tinder experience as always: get a drink, go back to one of our places, and hook up. That's exactly how it went, but there was a connection between us that was unlike any other Tinder experience I have had. We both seemed to really enjoy each others company and we had a lot in common. Also, with me feeling better about life I am less opposed to something more than casual.

Since then we have been seeing each other fairly frequently, more than just in a hook up context. We go on really fun dates, hang out, watch movies, cook together--I even suggested that we slow things down sexually so we can get to know each other better. We have both expressed that we like each other and spending time together. Everything seems to be going very well but this is a strange situation for me considering how the relationship started. I just am starting to feel confused about what I ""should"" be doing or how the relationship ""should"" be going with how it started with sex, slowed down a little, and is now picking back up as we get more comfortable with each other.

Does anyone else have an experience like this?  I have read a lot of stories about Tinder success stories but I am unsure of how many of them came from what was supposed to be just a hookup.

She's not exactly my ""ex"" because we were never official. She was my first friend when I moved here 6 years ago and I eventually fell in love with her. It was sort of a FWB situation. We've told each other 'I love you' many times and have been on &amp; off in contact over the years ... but we're very close. She has a self destructive personality and I could never get her to commit to being with me (nor would that have been the wisest choice) ... So once again I stopped talking to her a few months ago.

Now I'm moving and I really want to see her before I go but is that a bad idea? I feel like I still love her enough that I want to be with her someday if she gets her sh\*t together, but I recognize that's a longshot.

The profile info on them hardly matches the prompts, so you know they're fake. I also see a lot more profiles blatantly advertising sex work with images that give you a link or a snapchat name.

There also seems to be way more profiles on there in general, which I'm guessing is because the app is finally hitting its stride with mainstream in the same way Tinder and Bumble have, and since people are probably sick of Tinder and Bumble, they're moving over there. Crowded profiles mean having to swipe through way more profiles you're not interested in plus it's more difficult for your profile to be noticed by others. Whenever I'd rejoin the app, I'd get 30-50 matches within the first month or two. I've gotten maybe 5 so far after a few weeks, most which have already died out, and I'm not receiving any new likes.

Add to that, Match's ownership of the app continues to gatekeep success for its most attractive members by hiding them all behind its ""Standouts"" section, which you need to purchase ""roses"" to leave a message and like for. The general premium service also has lessened in benefits as well, only giving you the ability for unlimited likes.

We all know most apps at the end of the day are a business that benefit only a select percentage of highly attractive Instagram model-type people, but Hinge used to be one of the apps that connected someone like myself -- decently handsome but not necessarily a model, very fit, and has their shit together with a well curated profile with very recent pictures and original personality in what's written -- with others who were very much in the same lane as me.

One piece of advice I often see that goes hand in hand with dating is to just try and meet as many new people as possible, in particular through apps like Meetup. I've downloaded Meetup and so far I haven't really found any groups or events near me that appeal to me in all honesty.

For one thing my city isn't even on there so all of the events near me are in the next town over. It's only a train ride away but its still a bit of a hassle to get there. The other problem I have is that most of the events are either geared towards older people (38-55 speed dating as an example) or they're tailored towards a hobby that I have no interest in.

There's basically not a big enough variety of groups/events that I feel I can easily fit into and just not enough going on near me. It might just be my location (UK), since I have seen some stories on hear of people having successes expanding their social circle and working their way into dating through Meetup but so far I don't seem to be as lucky.

So I'm curious if there are any other similar apps or sites I could use for this.
