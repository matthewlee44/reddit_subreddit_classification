It didn't work out. so this quarter, we were picking seats in our new class, and I show up and see my friend, Don, on the other side of the room, so I bee-line it over to him. just as I'm about to round the corner to grab the seat next to Don, at the end of the row, I see ""Mike"" in the row in front of Don, and he's smiling and waving at me. I said Hi, and grabbed the seat next to don. suddenly Mike's smile falls away. I am a little socially inept and I didn't realize that I think Mike was waving me over to sit next to him. we were passing around the seating chart. and after I write my name I am passing it up to Mike and he literally waved it away and wouldn't take it. I kept trying to give him the chart and he refused. he kept shaking his head. It honestly didn't occur to me what was going on until after the mid-class break and Mike changed his seat to somewhere across the room.

I feel sort of bad. I really did not mean to snub him or whatever. I am very close friends with Don though. For what it is worth, Don is gay, so he isn't a romantic interest. Mike knows that Don is gay (not sure if that matters). anyways a few days after that I ran into mike as we were all leaving class and MIke seemed very cold towards me.

am i misunderstanding or is Mike mad that I didnt sit next to him? I honestly didnt even SEE him there . i was focused on Don, my closest friend. I wouldn't have sat next to Mike over Don even if I had noticed him there. Did I hurt his feelings? If so, how can I make it right? I feel like he really hates me right now.

also. this isnt the first like ""misunderstanding"" between mike and I after we dated. before the quarter started, he threw a couple get togethers while I was out of town and I think he thought I blew them off, but I was out of town.  i told him i was out of town for the first invite, then he invited me to another group get together less than a week later. I was still out of town. I told him i couldn't make it. I think he thought I was lying about that but he kept scheduling the things at times when I was unable to attend. I definitely would have, if i was in town. Im not really sure if that has something to do with him feeling weird around me.

but the situation is very weird.....because we had gone out on a date and he definitely did NOT want a relationship. so it's very confusing to me how he's acting like i'm hurting his feelings but it's not like he even wants a relationship with me. So i feel bad if i hurt his feelings, but i guess i just am having a hard time understanding what I can do to not hurt his feelings?

*Thank you all for replying to my last thread.*
As many people suggested, I joined the gym to get in shape because I understand that I must take care of my body to get girls. I also started taking testosterone tablets to look masculine. 
Progress is still 0, no girls want to talk with me and I am still poor (not focusing on money for now). However, I noticed a bit of change in my body even though I am fat I am not weak, I can do more weight in many exercises than average guys.

It didn't work out. so this quarter, we were picking seats in our new class, and I show up and see my friend, Don, on the other side of the room, so I bee-line it over to him. just as I'm about to round the corner to grab the seat next to Don, at the end of the row, I see ""Mike"" in the row in front of Don, and he's smiling and waving at me. I said Hi, and grabbed the seat next to don. suddenly Mike's smile falls away. I am a little socially inept and I didn't realize that I think Mike was waving me over to sit next to him. we were passing around the seating chart. and after I write my name I am passing it up to Mike and he literally waved it away and wouldn't take it. I kept trying to give him the chart and he refused. he kept shaking his head. It honestly didn't occur to me what was going on until after the mid-class break and Mike changed his seat to somewhere across the room.

I feel sort of bad. I really did not mean to snub him or whatever. I am very close friends with Don though. For what it is worth, Don is gay, so he isn't a romantic interest. Mike knows that Don is gay (not sure if that matters). anyways a few days after that I ran into mike as we were all leaving class and MIke seemed very cold towards me when I tried to make small talk with him and ask him how he was doing. (I hadn't really spoken to him in like a month) he kinda gave me the cold shoulder

am i misunderstanding or is Mike mad that I didnt sit next to him? I honestly didnt even SEE him there . i was focused on Don, my closest friend. I wouldn't have sat next to Mike over Don even if I had noticed him there. Did I hurt his feelings? If so, how can I make it right? I feel like he really hates me right now.

also. this isnt the first like ""misunderstanding"" between mike and I after we dated. before the quarter started, he threw a couple get togethers while I was out of town and I think he thought I blew them off, but I was out of town.  i told him i was out of town for the first invite, then he invited me to another group get together less than a week later. I was still out of town. I told him i couldn't make it. I think he thought I was lying about that but he kept scheduling the things at times when I was unable to attend. I definitely would have, if i was in town. Im not really sure if that has something to do with him feeling weird around me.

but the situation is very weird.....because we had gone out on a date and he definitely did NOT want a relationship. so it's very confusing to me how he's acting like i'm hurting his feelings but it's not like he even wants a relationship with me. So i feel bad if i hurt his feelings, but i guess i just am having a hard time understanding what I can do to not hurt his feelings?

I invited her to join myself and a couple mutual friends to a concert we are already planning to go to.

I never share my phone number because of personal reasons... Last time we date he said he like me and wants to spend more time together. I felt the same way that we had a good connection. He invited me to meet his friends and parents, because of his work schedule we weren't able to yet. Last week I was planning to go out of town and told him I want to see him before I leave. We schedule to meet one day before my trip, but on the night before I just mentioned to him about drinking. We have been talking about everything, I mean everything... work, ambitions, family, hobbies, our dreams

So I explained to him that I don't drink, but I am not planning on starting ever. I told him how I feel about the alcohol. This conversation was on chat. I don't mind him drinking, but I just want to make sure and get to know about his drinking. He said he doesn't need to drink to have fun, and he likes a couple of drinks after dinner.

Then after he said that: He unmatched me. I wasn't sure what happened. If he really unmatched me. On the next day, I went to come and see him. He knew how hard it was for me to plan things during the week. I wait for him for one hour he didn't show up. I created a new account on Tinder to just message him. I just asked him to call me so we can talk I think he misunderstood what I was saying which he did.

Still never heard back from him. I am so disappointed how immature people can be. I've been so honest with him about everything. We made plans to spend his birthday together in a couple of weeks.

He is really a caring guy, might get a little angry at times but is always the first one to apologize. Helps me with a ton of things, and not just me I guess, he is helpful to everyone.  My bf really got strong booze for the first time because for some reason he wanted to wait till 25 and spilt out some things to me. There were 3 weird things he told me about himself and I just feel uncomfortable now. Now, I am not sure whether I truly like him or not. We have a lot of memories together but after what he told me.. I don't know.. I just don't know. 
I can't tell you what he said exactlyy tho.. because that would be really humongous message but it was something like: 
1. When I asked him why you take so much burden by yourself to help others. He answered that he was not alone and had two people with him all the time, I thought he was talking about his parents and friends, or someone else but he says there are two other people inside him and that's hella weird. I thought this is how it would get when he is drunk(the crazy drunk talk) but then he showed me his 400+ voice recording of him talking to himself in different voices. That was so weird.

2. He told that one of ""person"" living inside him is a liar and another was an angry individual. He suddenly started a conversation like,""You don't love me actually, you are forced to love me"" and I tried to defend myself saying I truly do and all that stuff. He continued and listed lots of psychological(non-psychological) things he did to grab my attention before we were together. Basically, there were instances were he lied multiple times and convinced me into believing that something like he was very reliable(which he is but to a noticeable extend), he does things which I love(or even convincing me into I love the things he do), and what not. The things I thought were coincidences were kinda not, he planned them, and there were not just 1-2 such things believe me, at least 50-60 or more. Not exactly like a stalker but he predicted my next move and tried to match it.

3. He also told me that he also had to convince my close friend(s)  that he was a really good guy(he brought them gifts and invited them to few events). In all this one of friend confessed her love for him to him, in fact, he also went on a date(s) with her (before we were together, also he said he didn't love her but had to do it which makes it even worse). My friend and he dated for less than a month and then finally she had to leave the city for academic purposes. He didn't told me what happened in them but they (he and friend) act like normal friends now. 

I never knew such version of my bf existed and I feel unsafe now. Makes me feel that if he can do it then he can do even worse. He made me question my feelings and it just feels hard to accept that my feelings are fake. I feel so not good but I think I really love him. On the other hand as a bf he never lacked at anything but I can't unthink about things that he told me. There were a lot more but these are the only ones that are on my mind.

She stated because non-Christian couples are not as resilient as Christian one and her example behind her logic is she works for a shelter that takes in refugees during a crisis and its the Christian ones who show the most resilience in times of trouble thus that shows their faith is stronger then those refugees who might be Muslim or Jewish.... it was a interesting back and forth from there that really felt like it went no where because she couldn't understand how I could disagree with her point of view,True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163885,public,self,An amusing exchange on Bumble,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tgtz5u/an_amusing_exchange_on_bumble/,no_ads,0,,,,,,

The details seem to represent the following traits that the alpha has and bear in mind that the person could poor . MOStly the cheating occurs in a truck or in a rented appartment .

1. He is extreme masculine man -- he outshine his surrondings with his magneticism .
2. He is a verbal seducer
3. He had a bad boy reputation or play reputation which reinforces his desirability .

He's also pretty well off financially for a college student; he owns his own house. I really, really like him and want to take things further, but there's just one thing. He loves Hot Wheels. And I mean, REALLY loves them.

I knew that he liked them from the start. When we went to the store together a few weeks ago, he wanted to stop by the Hot Wheels aisle. Ok, he's got a cheap hobby, cool....or so I thought. I never knew just how serious he was about them until I went over to his house. He has a whole room filled with nothing but Hot Wheels, on the walls and everything. Now, I don't think it's ""childish"" or anything. I myself collect stuffed animals. But his collection is easily worth hundreds if not thousands of dollars and it makes me wonder if it's something he really should be doing as a college student. He also has a pretty big video game collection, though he says he's planning on selling most of it soon. 

Like I said, I don't think it's a bad thing that he's 21 and collecting toy cars. I just think it's a little excessive for him at this point in life, when he should be saving his money. I want to talk to him about it, but I don't know how he'll react. I don't want to screw things up.

The first date went great and there were moments where we were more intimate than expected.

I really didn’t know how to love and receive love so I kind of just thought to my self hey if you do everything you can to please someone and completely rid your self of any kind of self identity then maybe just maybe that’s what love is. 

I should also preface that the examples of love that I witnessed as a child were heavily toxic &amp; manipulative in nature with a dash of extreme verbal and physical abuse (my mothers boyfriends weren’t the best people including my biological father).

So after beginning my conquest to devote my entire being to one person I soon came to discover that with an attitude like mine I was certainly going to be abused and taken advantage of when all I was wanting was to be held and share the joy that most couples  have. Due to my twisted idea of what love feels like I genuinely thought well all this abuse and unfulfilling sex is love. I knew that in the back of my mind that love was definitely supposed to be different it should not feel like a panic attack or some kind of chore. Honestly the only portion of all the relationships fwb and many rebounds that I actually enjoyed was the smooth calm hazy silence after a night of trying so desperately to make someone have an orgasm so great that they would see me as someone so amazing and worth remembering that they too would want the same love that I crave. (Which is literally just to feel comfortably at ease with someone where all the cloud and confusion of existence trickles down into something beautiful).

The last kind of relationship I had with someone was my biggest high-school crush. She was so damn beautiful, undeniably sweet, and so calming although she thought of her self as nothing remarkable I definitely saw her as a place of pure bliss which was extremely different from every past relationship I’ve ever had. The weirdest part is on the night of my birthday I could tell that she wanted to fuck but the first time in my life I truly felt okay with just cuddling up with her in her bed and feeling the warmth of a kind human being right next to me completely skipping the anxiety driven sexual impulse and straight to just feeling okay and that was certainly the best feeling I have ever had with someone. To feel safe with another human being is better than sex. Sadly those moments of bliss and excitement turned to ash as the inevitable ghosting occurred and honestly that’s the first time ghosting actually cut so deeply. It was truly soul crushing I’m still a bit shaken by that one if I’m being honest.

(2.5 years later)

I have now found my self in this weird stage in life I actually put my life together during the pandemic. I got my finances in order got a new car and an actually decent paying job I also live alone now which is great but I do miss living with my grandparents. I even packed on a few pounds of muscle, picked up the guitar, and started modeling again which has been making friends much easier and it also gets me out of the house (I work from home as a web developer). I definitely have changed the way that I approach women to ensure the safety of my own self identity but the changes made are more so internal rather than external. Instead of coming in with the thought of devoting my self to someone I’m kind of just dipping my toes in trying to get to know them and understand what there values and ambitions are. Hopefully along the way I make them laugh by doing/saying something goofy as I try to get them to talk about their passions and then further the conversation with more meaningful conversation in an attempt to get to the root of their being. I mainly do this on the classic dating apps but it’s all in vain because 90% of the time I get ghosted after asking them relatively interesting questions about them selves like “What is something that you find so interesting it’s hard not to think about?” Or if they say in their bio that they read or write or do art “What are your favorite lines that you have written/read or art that you’ve created/seen and why?”. I of course ask them all the other preliminary questions that are pretty general when getting to know someone. 

Here’s the main reason why I spent an hour writing this up to get 2 upvotes and 1 comment saying “shit idk I’m in the same boat” lol: 

How do I stop getting ghosted? Being ghosted is my prime number one S tier level of interactions with potential partners online and in person and I never send them any kind of text saying “oh I guess I’m ghosted” because then I turn into another guy complaining about being completely forgotten about. You think someone would become so desensitized to being ghosted repeatedly that it wouldn’t hurt anymore but it kind of just reinforces the overall “I am in purgatory” narrative. And when I say that I have no clue why this is happening I really have no idea like I’m pretty well spoken and I’m always in the mood to talk about anything from random thoughts, traumas, and dreams to existence it’s self and all I ever do is encourage and hope that people do well with a charismatic attitude but idk lately it feels like that it’s all wasted energy on people that don’t really matter in my life and maybe it is maybe it isn’t but it doesn’t stop that problem solver brains from thinking of a reason to change the outcome of most of my interactions online and in person. It certainly doesn’t help when every one of your friends comments on why you’re single like damn do you want to go on some cute dates then? (most of my friends are girls btw but I am straight)

I peg my self for being pretty smart but I cannot figure out what’s going on like I used to have to turn down women because I was busy with someone else but now it’s the complete opposite and it’s maddening. And for context I’m a 6’1 light skinned well groomed and well dressed man with a big ole head of conditioned curly blonde hair that looks like vash the stampede’s. I also have a pretty good looking jaw line &amp; a big ole lined up beard.

I also hope people believe me because I am in true disarray and I would appreciate feed back or even a dumb joke to ease the burden.

It’s to the point that sometimes he will avoid eye contact w me and I can see him blush to no end, which is the cutest thing but I’m still a little worried. 

Also, we kiss and stuff like that but we’ve only been completely intimate a handful of times and whenever we are I can also feel that he’s very nervous. When I ask him about it he says he “doesn’t want to disappoint me or do anything that I don’t like.” During another instance,  We finally had a chance to stay the night together a few weeks ago. It was actually his idea but then when he came over and things were going great (no sex, just kissing and cuddles) and suddenly he tells me that he doesn’t know if he is ready for us to stay the night together after all. This totally threw me for a loop. I should also mention that he’s been single for a very long time - a little over three years. He’s a single dad and is great at it. When I asked him what was wrong he kept reiterating that it’s not me, it’s just the first time he’s liked someone this much in a very long time that he overthinks. I don’t know what to do. I’m trying to be patient and let him open up to me but I can’t help but to feel that I’m doing something wrong (not trying to make this about me at all but just can’t help it) to which he always says that I’m not and he’s happy.

Thing is, I feel like my personality might be undesirable for a lot of guys when it comes to dating me. I generally don’t really have a problem with getting dates and can tell that a guy is attracted to me physically, but when I start acting like myself I feel like they get less interested… 

From my point of view, I am a big jokester and not very dainty or feminine in my behaviour. I really like making people laugh, and am not cool or mysterious at all, I make a fool out of myself a lot if it’ll make my friends laugh… I’m worried that my personality draws guys that I’m interested in away because there have been many times when I start talking with someone and they’re super into me, and then as I start to show my true colours they become less flirty and more friendly. 

It’s a difficult thought for me, because I know that if I started behaving a certain mysterious, and cool way that guys get more interested. I’ve done it before, because when I’m not interested in a guy, this is generally how I behave, and most of the time they’ll be very interested in me… I feel like guys are always interested in the cool and distant version of me. 

Should i try to hide myself from ppl when I first meet them and act more dainty and soft spoken? Is that how dating works? Putting on a facade and then slowly unravelling your true self?

We met online as friends 2 months ago and since then we have went to many places including the beach, museums, parks, sports, and shopping. We are pretty close friends as we hit it off right from the beginning. Our personalities just fit each other to be friends instantly. We text almost every night for hours about anything and nothing. I've been feeling more interested in her lately but I don't know if she reciprocates.


She doesn't flirt much. We have piggybacked each other in the beach waters, lied down together on fields, taken many pictures together and she has also suggested that we wrote our names in the sand and for me to take a picture of it.


However, I find that she isn't very touchy. The closest touchy thing she's done outside of the beach is that she'd hold onto my shirt sleeve when we walk around but thats it. She's also said some stuff long ago when I asked for advice about liking a friend, where she suggested that I might be feeling that way because I'm currently still waiting for school and don't have a job.


What do you guys think? Should I ask her out on a date?
