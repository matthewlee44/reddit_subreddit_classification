I've been on several dating sites for 2 years now. This is the story of my first match 3 weeks ago.

It happened on Badoo. I started with the question feature of the app. ( both parties answear the same question, then they see each others result). I had choosen ""What would you assume about me based on my profile"". For the record, I have a full bio, long introduction, several pictures. 
(Translated from my language)
Me: ""One of your hobby is cooking!""
Her: ""I don't know.""
Me: ""I'm that cryptic for you?""
Her: ""Don't judge anyone, so you won't be judged.""

From there It's continued downhill. I tried to ask her questions, based on her profile, only got few words back, no questions about me. This goes on for a few days. I've even watched a movie she mentioned once (in her only non zero effort post), but still couldn't jumpstart the convesation.

I asked her out for a coffe/cake date, but she said she have to talk more to a guy. At that point I asked her, why she is even here on this dating site, if she don't put any effort in. Her response: "" I see that the conversation is bad, but I don't care that much. I hate forced, boring talks that goes nowhere.""

I know this is an ""isolated incident"", but when the few girls that are ""willing"" to talk to me does this all the time, it's tiring.

I (33F) met my boyfriend (28M) in October. First date was sparks flying and match on every level from expectations in life to shared life experiences. For the first time, in a long time, I met someone I could see a future with.

We're both ambitious and dedicated to our careers and he travels abroad at least once a week which meant dates once a week/1.5 weeks which I was absolutely fine with. Slept together on the 5th date but he couldn't maintain an erection and said it was because of the condom. Fair enough. Same thing happened the next time ad we both agreed that we would get tested and I would go on the contraceptive pill. Ironically, right after that he started to distance himself and became unsure of the relationship. He also got Covid at the time and was in quarantine and miserable. When we eventually spoke about it, his belief was that I was more invested in the relationship than he was and he ""wasn't there yet"". What was supposed to be a break up call lasted 2 hours with neither one of us really wanting to end the conversation.

This was right before the Christmas holidays and we were both leaving London to go back to our respective countries for the holidays. I told him that it's clearly not working, wished him the best and broke it off.

The holidays were unbelievably miserable and I was surprised at the sense of loss and regret I felt at losing someone I had dated for such a short period. After the holidays, we're both back in London and I reached out to him saying that our last call had left more questions than answers and we should meet in person. He agreed.

When we met - all the feelings came back and we almost immediately went back into couple mode. He admitted that he had also struggled with the break up. I was more hesitate than him but we agreed that we had a good thing and would work on making it work. We had another date a week later and attempted sex again, this time without condoms and he had the same ED issues. He gets an erection but can not maintain it. This time the issue was how tired he was.

Fast forward just two weeks - and its back to the distancing. I know he's busy and is working all weekend but the lack of effort given all the promises made is making me reconsider and the sex issues on top of that, I'm not sure that other than feelings, I have anything to gain in the relationship.

Is he avoiding me so he doesn't have to deal with the erectile dysfunction issues or is it simply that he's not invested in me &amp; the relationship?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1155664,public,self,Walk or Talk?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sfjj1h/walk_or_talk/,no_ads,0.0,dating,,,

Now that my frontal cortex is done developing and I've had a couple COVIDy years to process my young adult dating life, I thought I'd share some truths I've learned throughout a variety of relationship types over the past few years. Some of these are things you see around this sub a lot and others are less obvious.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **When people tell/show you who they are, believe them.** This applies in a few situations. Firstly, if someone says they're not interested in a committed relationship, they're not going to change their mind, so don't proceed as if they're magically going to want to get serious with you. In addition, if someone does something very shitty early in a relationship, do not assume they can change. Most people don't, or are simply unable to do so on a timeline that works for you. And lastly, if people openly tell you about a difficult personality quirk or character defect of theirs, that trait WILL eventually be a problem in your relationship. Think hard about if you can live with that trait. For example, I had an ex warn me that if XYZ event ever happened in his life, he would become impossible to date/interact with in a healthy way and I should leave him. I listened and left him when that event did happen, and I'm very glad that I did because it saved a lot of heartache.
2. **The amount of effort someone puts into a first date is a pretty good indicator for how they will show up in your relationship.** I've had a lot of dates where the other person suggested last minute that we go to the same couple of local beer bars to meet up and chat. This isn't necessarily a bad date idea but it is pretty low effort and not interesting. In contrast, my current SO went out of their way to take me to a fancy cocktail place for our first date even though we are both poor. They insisted on paying for my drinks and ensured that I got to my destination safely at the end of the date. This person routinely shows up for me in ways big and small, making a huge effort to make me happy and do nice things together. Their behavior towards me during the courting stage was an enormous green flag that has proven to endure.
3. **If you aren't SUPER ENTHUSIASTIC about introducing someone to your friends, if they embarrass you, or if you wouldn't be platonic friends with them, DO NOT DATE THEM.** You probably don't like them that much and it's not fair to them or you.
4. **It's so much better to date someone who is kind and dorky than someone who is conventionally smoking hot.** Your attraction to an average looking person will grow over time. With hot people who are less kind or compatible with you, it's likely going to be the opposite.
5. **If you always smell shit, check your shoes. Ie: if you routinely are dating people with the same issues or the same kinds of conflicts arise over and over in your life, YOU are most likely the problem.** For me, I spent years dating active addicts, alcoholics, and people with other unhealed toxic -isms because of my own codependency, poor boundaries, and general emotional toxicity. Now that I've taken the time to work on those issues, I am in a very healthy relationship, and I generally move through the world with less bad vibes.
6. **Being critical and negative is not hot. Nor is being a bad listener.** Work on your social skills. I'm white, decently attractive, and outgoing so I was able to form ""connections"" with people for a long time without thinking much about how I came off to others. As I got older, I found that fewer people were willing to put up with this (thank god). You will have better dates and enjoy life more if you are positive, listen and ask leading questions, and have interesting stuff to say that isn't just opinion based.
7. **Too much emotional enthusiasm early on is a sign of poor boundaries and a serious red flag.** My two most unhealthy relationships were with people who told me they loved me within a week of meeting me (yes I was dumb). Also, hanging out with your SO every day in your 20s is probably not great unless you live together.
8. **If you can't live without it, you can't live with it.** If your relationship is all-consuming, your only reason to keep going, the only way you spend your time, or your only way to feel confident/loved/connected, I can guarantee it is not healthy, and your breakup is going to suuuuuuck when that emotional rug gets pulled out from under you.
9. **It's okay if casual sex isn't for you.** I came of age during the area of ""sex positive"" girl boss feminism and ended up having a lot of casual sex that I regret. After being celibate for over a year due to quarantine, I can confidently say that emotional connection is extremely important for my sexual satisfaction. It's okay to have this boundary- a lot of people feel the same way.
10. **It's okay to have high standards or want people with the same ambitions as you.** For years I was not very selective about mid to long term partners because I didn't want to be classist, wanted to give people the benefit of the doubt, and believed that great connections could be made across lifestyles (I'm very high achieving, educated, and active). It turns out that lifestyle compatibility does really matter (shocker), and finding someone who is similarly ambitious is essential. This does not make you judgment and you're probably not missing anything.
11. **You might not have the tools to be polyamorous, especially if you don't have a lot of relationship experience.** My SO and I prefer a poly dynamic, but our lives are separately sufficiently chaotic right now that we need to not be dating others. I only realized this after starting to date someone else and having to flake out because I wasn't respecting my own capacity. Don't do that.
12. **Pay attention to how people behave in conflict.** Conflict is not necessarily bad-- it can be an opportunity to get on the same page about how to best meet each others' needs. At worst, it can reveal that your needs/wants/personalities are simply not compatible, allowing you to stop wasting your time on something that will eventually unravel. If a potential love interest is aggressive, sarcastic, yells during conflict, or does anything other than trying as hard as possible to communicate clearly and with good intent, that person is probably not ready for the challenges that come with a long term relationship. 99.9% of the time there is no reason to yell at your partner. This also goes for conflict avoidance- if people run away from potential issues, your chance of successfully working out problems in the future is not good.
13. **Vaguely not feeling good after you hang out with someone is plenty of reason to stop hanging out with them.** For both friends and entanglements, I used to try to come up with some well thought-out rationale for why I didn't want to continue hanging out with a person. Sometimes a bad vibe is literally all you need (pay attention to how it feels in your body!). Your relationships should be sustaining and life giving, not draining.
14. **Mixed signals should be taken as a no.** This sort of goes back to my first point. You deserve to date someone who is enthusiastic about being with you AND has space in their life for you. If people are giving mixed signals it's usually because they aren't that interested but want to keep you as an option. Alternatively, someone might really like you but just have stuff going on in their life that makes them not a compatible match for you, OR they could be a really bad communicator. I don't really subscribe to ""if they wanted to, they would""-- shit happens, and I personally want to show up for people more than I'm able to. But regardless of why someone isn't enthusiastically communicating where they're at, if you find yourself confused about someone's intentions a lot, it's probably best to end it there.
15. **This is for my bi folks, especially non-men:** You do not have to subscribe to compulsory heterosexuality. I've known I was queer for about ten years but only set my personal boundary to not date cis hetero dudes relatively recently after years of frustrating dynamics that included elements of poor communication, low effort/weaponized incompetence, mediocre sex, etc. While some cis straight guys are wonderful and don't have these issues, I personally find the filtration process to be tedious and historically not very rewarding, which matters a lot when you're actively trying to date new people (first dates can get old). I had a lot of issues with internalized homophobia and anxiety about vaginas but my life is a lot better since I decided to stop looking for needles in the haystack. This is just my experience and I know it won't make sense to a lot of people but on the off chance that it makes even one bisexual girl/NB's life better, I thought I'd add it.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been on a few dates and my general rule is nothing physical on a first date. No hand holding, kissing or anything. At most maybe a hug goodbye. I've been told this is a good things by some or a bad thing by others and even just go with the flow by more. So I'm here to ask Reddit's opinion. 

I normally fear showing to much physical affection like soft touches, hand holding or kissing on a first date will tell the lady I'm dating that I'm only seeing her for sex. I personally want to date a lady with the eventual goal of a long term relationship. So play things cool on a first date or they might think ""he only wants sex"".

I the other camp I've been told if the mode feels right and light touching, kisses or hand holding opportunities present themselves, take the chance and give it ago. This will show the lady I am affectionate (which I am a very affectionate guy by nature). I've also been told if I pass up obvious opportunities the lady is likely to friend zone me. 

I've also been told to just use my best judgement as every girl is different. This to me feels like the right answer, but I still got fears and reservations from my previous 2 options weighting on me and just want to put this out there and ask you guys and girls what you think.

I’m 28 (m) &amp; she’s 27 (F)

So I showed up at her place at 5:30. She was gorgeous! But wasn’t feeling confident bc she just fit a face peel and her face was super shiny and she didn’t think she looked date worthy but she was gorgeous

Originally we planned on eating Indian food but I asked if she had ever been to a Malibu Jacks (it’s like Dave &amp; Busters)

She said she been before but she was JUST talking to her friend about how she REALLY wanted to play laser tag but she felt like being 27 meant she’s too old to for that  but she really wants to have a fun time and do it 

I told her to get in the car bc we’re going to play laser tag and arcade games 😂 she was hungry so we ate in there. She had a burger and fries and I just had fries bc I wasnt hungry 

We showed up and played laser tag and it was a blast! We kinda played with the other people at times but we just chased each other and talked shit and laughed. (I won the match) She told me afterward that it was a blast! She was excited 

Next we played ski ball and whoever lost with the lowest points had to confess something something no ourselves.

Then I spent almost $10 on a claw game trying to win her a damn teddy bear 😂 I never got it but I won her a little rubber duck with a game we played so she loved that

Then my father called me and told me my grandfather is dying. I ran outside bc I needed it to be quiet and my father gave me 1 minute to say my last goodbyes to my grandfather before he passed and he was gonna call my other siblings to do the same 

I took the call and took some deep breathes to not look emotional. She asked me if I was okay I told her not really but it’s family stuff and I’ll tell her AFTER our date bc I didn’t want it to kill the mood and her look at me with pity. So I compartmentalized it and told myself I’ll feel everything after this date bc I couldn’t just do all this emotionally now  

We played more games And talked. She said she was having a great time but noticed I was a little off. I told her well enjoy everything and talk about the issue later but right now we just enjoy the moment 

We played a few more games together and then rode a ride. It’s like the tilt-a-whirl 

We were about to get in the seat and she said “wait, if we sit that way you’ll be smushed against me bc of the force of gravity spinning us ..are your sure your wanna sit like that?”

I picked the hint and  switched sided and she said “I was hoping you’d do that!” And smiled 

We rode the ride and she was smushed against me and we laughed. She was crushing my arm a bit tho so she said “are you comfortable?” I moved my arm and put it around her and she said “that’s definitely better” and laughed 

After the ride we went back to the car. She asked if I was ready to head back to her place to make the brownies we talked about making together

I told her I’d love to but I can’t rn I explained what happened with my grandfather and the issue and I told her “I’d love to be at your place and spend more time with you but I can’t give you my full attention or emotional attention rn bc of this but I’d love to see her again before i go” she said she understood and rubbed my shoulder and we talked about my grandfather and heaven and life 

I took her to her house, she gave me some pumpkin bread she made, we hugged and she said she’s down to meet again

Looking for some feedback, input, or ideas on how to address this seemingly tricky and difficult topic with my girlfriend.

To sum things up, I'm(36/m) with no kids dating (28/f) with a child for about 6 months and things have been going relatively well! We've got a lot in common and very similar lifestyles and overall, generally have a great relationship. There's just one thing that I'm having serious difficulty with, and it's the behavior of her child. For a little detail to the situation, my girlfriend has been raising her child (8) while living with her mother and stepdad. The child's father isn't in her life and the additional support is really beneficial.

Basically, the child does whatever she wants, and I feel it's a result of living with grandma/grandpa as they cater to her 24/7/365. If she doesn't get what she wants, she absolutely loses it and throws hysterical meltdowns on an almost daily basis. Some examples: 

* She demands things be done. For example, last night she told me to ""Watch her lego"" while she was using the restroom before bed. When she came out, I was looking at a text on my phone and wasn't watching her lego and she lost control. Hysterically crying, screaming, demanding I explain why I dont do what she says. Her grandma eventually put her to bed, and she said goodnight to everyone but me. 
* The behavior is pretty constant. If her mom tells her she can't do something, she demands reasons and just won't follow instruction while having meltdowns. 
* Simple requests such as ""Say Thank You"" or asking her to throw her trash away are ignored, she will literally walk away and laugh. 
* She ignores and sort of direction at home. No does not mean no. 
* She makes all of the decisions. Chooses what she wants to eat, and that decides what everyone else is having. 

While she does have her sweet times, it just feels like everyone is walking on eggshells around her to avoid any meltdowns. I do notice her behavior is better when she is out of her house. 

There are no repercussions for bad behavior, and any threats of punishment aren't followed through with. I wasn't raised this way and just don't see myself allowing my child to every have this type of behavior. As someone who wants kids, this is also concerning as to my gf being OK with this behavior. 

My questions:

Is this just normal dating parenting issues that I'm not familiar with?

Has anyone experienced this? How should I go about addressing my concerns? 

Is this a red flag?

I am very interested in the this relating to people who use OLD or /r4r type subs.  

If an overweight person saw a profile that listed a preference for thin, fit and highly active people, for many, that would suggest they probably should move on.  Even if the overweight person was fairly active, there's enough description to suggest bias against size.  

How should an overweight person respond to the profile of someone who has lost a lot of weight?  I've seen quite a few people on r4r that have lost over 100 lbs.  Some of them mention wanting someone else that exercises or is health conscious.  But a lot of them don't.  

If I were overweight and liked a lot about a profile but their profile mentioned they lost a lot of weight, I  would be afraid they'd be critical of whatever lifestyle choices or health conditions that may or may not have contributed to my own weight.  

If you've lost weight, do you state in your profile the body style or activity level that are dealbreakers?  

Please, this is NOT a post about how to find someone.  This is not making any judgement on any body size or health journey.  I don't need anyone to tell me to just go ahead and lose weight if I want to find someone.

TL:Dr. If you have lost a lot of weight and mention this in your profile, should overweight people just move on?  Are you more or less sympathetic for an overweight person since you've been there? Do you think you would be compelled to improve, fix, or change them?

Tl:Dr 2:. Regardless of your weight, I am also curious if you would want an overweight person to swipe right/reach out if they otherwise might be a great match?

I (F22) had been talking to this guy (m24) for a month without meeting as we lived in different area for Christmas break. I guess you could say that anticipation was building up between us and we were both excited to meet. In that month we had laughs, disagreements, and talk all day everyday.

When we met yesterday, it was awkward and uncomfortable because it hit me that he was more like those nerd guys that are really blunt and socially awkward. He’s a very organized and focus person with strict routine and our interaction felt scheduled and I did not feel comfortable. I’m not someone who is shy to say how I feel so I tell him and he assures me it’s fine. We talk and try to be intimate. I just became disappointed because I felt like I built up all this chemistry and it just wasn’t what I wanted at all. I was embarrassed that I even entertained this for long. I had to stop in the middle of intimacy as it looked like I was about to cry. I just don’t know why but I guess the ambiance and his true personality made me uncomfortable. 

Anyways, he brought me over but when it was his “bed time” he just let me leave knowing that I did not drive myself or whatever. Luckily, I was have money and Uber but he didn’t even mentioned that he wasn’t gonna take me home or even check how I was gonna get home. I felt so angry because it’s basic common courtesy to at least make sure the person got back safe.
As I left and he closed the door I just blocked him and deleted him on everything.

So, I (18F) have been single, since, well, forever. Never had a boyfriend, never had someone tell I love you to me, except for my friends. All my friends have had boyfriends, multiple, to say the least, and here I am, with no darling in sight for me. I am genuinely happy for all of my commited friends, but honestly, I am tired of third wheeling. And the current situation has forbidden us to go out and mingle with people, but I am also shared of trying dating apps, because of safety reasons. For all of time, I have given relationship advises to my friends, yet not having any experience, but then, I feel really lonely, and when I see people my age being happy in their relationships, I always think that probably I am not meant for love, and will die alone in my room, watching a series.

Also, for a bit more context, I am a fairly chubby girl, (your girl is thickkk), so I think that because of that, guys may not be attracted to me? But then, there are others who say that looks don't matter, and I have no clue of what to believe. I am an integral member of the introvert community, with anxiety being my companion. You know, when you see someone post about their SO on any social media, and then you are like, oh, this person also got a partner, and here I am, rotting alone, that is me.

At least not until i turn 30..or maybe never..it all depends on how I age.

I have a very young looking face, one that people would refer to as neotenous, but one that I would refer to as visibly underdeveloped, small and deformed looking.
I have to come to terms with the fact that my facial structure probably won’t change in the next few years..at least not drastically and to the extent that
1.I’d go from looking like a 12-15 year old at most to a grown woman
2. I wish it would

Before continuing, I would like to beg anyone to refrain from comments like “You’ll be thankful for it when you’re older” “You’ll look great as you age, at 40 you’ll look like 20..” etc..as these enrage me and because I hate people’s attempts at giving me false hope, being dismissive and invalidating me, especially when not knowing or understanding my situation 

Not only is a babyface, the way mine is shaped not guaranteed to look good or younger with age, as well as there being the risk of ending up like those people from the 13or30 sub…considering I have bad bone structure, pre jowls and horrible eyebags
but the downsides of looking significantly younger imo outweigh any potential benefits of it..most of which I don’t think are benefits at all..

My body isn’t much better, I’m petite, small built..childlike, with very narrow shoulders and hips..I once calculated my hip size in inches and it turned out to be way below average for a woman..Someone on a sub actually commented that that is not the normal hip size for a woman but for a teen starting puberty..it just reinforced my already poor self image


My face, my humongous bulgy eyes disgust me..my pouty small lips, my facial expression is so childlike as well, like an actual kid, a confused stupid looking kid…there is absolutely nothing attractive about me, no matter how old I get, I will never be attractive or hot, or sexy..it would be possible to maybe be perceived as pretty and only if I could compensate with a personality, but to be seen by someone as physically desirable? No

And it breaks my heart, that I will never know what it’s like to feel like a woman, never be able to truly dress like one because my body doesn’t allow it.
I hate imagining myself being intimate with someone, it’s like they would be with a child…

I’ve thought about kms honestly, because I don’t want to live a life so unfulfilled and filled with embarrassment, shame and disgust over myself.

Idk if this is the right sub to help with my problem but I'll give it a try. Also, my apologies for not being able to make the story shorter than this.

A year ago, I went for training at this place and I met this man there, we started talking about work and he suggested that I add him on fb. after a couple of months I got a job offer similar to what he has and I sent him a message asking for advice. he said he prefers to talk on what's app to send voice messages ( even though he could have done that on fb messenger) but anyway I texted him there. He suggested I meet him at this café to tell me more about his job. I kept delaying meeting him a lot because I was busy with some stuff but after weeks I went there and met him. he talked more about himself. At first, I wasn't sure if he likes me or not but after meeting him I felt certain he doesn't , because he kept describing the girl he would like to marry and from what he shared it was totally the opposite of me. after that we texted on and off, sometimes he used to compliment me too much and  
I didn't like that, so I told him I don't mind having male friends but I don't like it when they flirt with me , I prefer to have limits and not cross them.  
after a couple of months , I asked him about something and he suggested to give me a favor , I accepted it (even though I wish I didn't) . he met me at that place where he helped me and we talked briefly , after that he talked to me almost everyday. he kept telling me to hook him up with one of my friends, and to share fb profiles of my friends who are single , or any girl who is single and suitable for him, and I did, and it started to get annoying and then he said he gave me a favor and I should return his favor back. he also kept asking to go out together again, but I kept refusing because he said he doesn't want to keep contacts with female friends once he find someone , so what is the point of going out together and becoming even closer friends and I know he'll cut contacts anytime soon?  
then he told me he actually want to go out with me because he likes me , and that he liked me since the beginning and that I am a queen and stuff like that, honestly I was surprised , but I also thought to give it a chance .. I asked him why would he ask me to hook him up with other girls if that was how he felt for me then he said "" I only did that to see your reaction about it , if you'll get jealous or not and to know if you like me back"" . I thought it is silly and childish but I decided to forgive it and give him a chance. I forgave many things that I didn't like. it was basically because my friends and family told me I should lower my standards already , everyone is getting engaged but me , so I thought I should just accept how things are. other things that I hated but let it happen ; he got mad at me for mentioning guys I have known before him ( I wasn't even in a relationship with these guys) , and he once got mad because I check other apps sometimes while he text me on what's app , he said its rude that I go offline like that and reply to him when I feel like it , even though I didn't actually take long to reply, and he always said how he is a great man and no one is like him, and he said "" I'm 99% and you're only the 1% that I need"" looking back at what he said it was so insulting and I just smiled at it and I didn't defend myself and just let it happen.

so after that i went out with him, and maybe I was awkward in the date because I am a shy girl , and I giggled often, I even type"" lol "" a lot during texting and he criticized that .. I also think I drooled while talking to him by accident lol we were eating pancakes and the sweets made me have too much saliva in my mouth I guess. I am sharing this to be fair that maybe at that last date he changed his mind about me but idk. he kept talking about himself in the date and his family and how they are rich. and he talked about other girls again. after I went home he texted me as usual and talked about girls. then I told him is he going to hook up with one of these girls then he said ""why? are you going to be jealous?"" then I told him let me try to understand , just because you said you like me , then it doesn't mean you want to have a relationship with me? and he said that's correct. I got a little bit mad and told him I feel like he played me and didn't respect what I told him that I prefer not to go out if we will be just friends, then he was like why are you accusing me of playing you and made me sound like I am crazy and said he didn't change his mind that he likes me but it doesn't mean much , and started saying how he can't be in a relationship rn for personal reasons, so I apologized for saying that ( this is the part I regret the most, I was super nice and I was apologizing even though I was being hurt ) and he said he felt bad because I told him I am distracted from studying since the day he told me has likes me, because he actually doesn't doesn't care much about it , and that saying I like you isn't a big deal and also said "" personally I am fine with whatever you do rn"" hinting that i delete contacts . I was shocked after that and thinking what the hell happened then I texted can we be friends and can you tell me you don't like me so we talk normal like before , and he sent me the rolling eye emoji and we pretty much stopped talking.

So after that I stopped texting him , and after 2 months he got engaged. And idk why I'm obsessed with this. I can't get him out of my mind and how he made a fool out of me. I can't keep his fiancee out of my head and stop comparing myself to her , she has colored eyes, she is younger, He threw me away like that but chose her because she is better. I keep thinking this happened to me because I'm not smart enough and I'm not attractive enough. people like her don't get played like I did because it's my fault I'm naïve and dumb and ugly.

However, the sad part is, he doesn't feel the same about me. He does care but wouldn't go as far to call it love. 
Also, since we both belong to the same 3rd world country where religion is a big deal , as well as the age gap and to top it off there's a distance of almost 1000 miles between us which make matters worse. 
He told me these were the reasons he wouldn't go ahead with us. Which in my opinion is being very real and smart and sexy. And I've tried to move on before and got into relationships when j liked someone(I gave my all in these relationships) and forget him but couldn't.

I initially went on Tinder looking for a hookup, but ended up chatting with this really sweet and chill girl who lived just a couple bloxks away. She said that she, ""Would love a boyfriend, but is ok with sex in the meantime."" After talking with her, I realized that we seem to have a lot of similar interests and I might be interested in pursuing a relationship with her.

However, I unfortunately did a terrible job communicating this to her. During our date (we went ice sakting and then to a bar), I was awkward and quiet and constantly worried about whether or not she liked me back. I didn't want to make any advances because I was worried it would make her feel uncomfortable. 

We chatted about our lives, and I realized that we are both pretty different people. She's very extroverted and relaxed, and I'm well, not. While many of our interests overlapped, we just couldn't seem to relate on much. She said I seem overly composed and a little emotionless.

We ended up going back to her apartment, where she told me that she doesn't feel any kind of sexual vibe toward me whatsoever and wondered why I took her on a date when she thought I was looking for sex.

I was pretty confused myself, and just really didn't articulate myself well at all. I told her that I would be cool with a friend with benefits type of situation essentially. But I don't think that was true. At this point, I felt I had really screwed things up and didn't really feel much attraction to her anymore.

She basically said that she thought sex with me wouldn't ""end well"" and we probably shouldn't.

I didn't want to just up and leave, so for the rest of the night we just chatted about our lives, smoked weed, and drank. The conversation actually got way deeper and more sexual than I thought, despite her repeatedly saying that she doesn't feel a sexual way about me. She also basically poured her heart out to me about her past boyfriends, and other drama in her life. We both talked about sex and I told her I was pansexual. This seemed to suck out what little intimacy there was between us, and the conversation just became two people who were talking.

After a while, we both went back to my place. We also watched 50 Shades of Grey (her suggestion) for some reason, and she said that the cold, emotionless, almost psychopathic stare of Christian Grey reminded her of me.

That really hurt me a lot. I wouldn't say I'm Robin Williams, but I'm not a stone-faced serial killer like she seems to think. I'm honestly a hopeless romantic.

At that point, I just wanted the night to be over and leave her alone. I didn't want to hug or kiss her on my way out, and just tried to be as polite as possible. 

I made a huge mistake in not making up my mind about her early on and it was dumb of me to take her on a date. A part of me thinks that my fear of disappointing others gives me a fear of commitment. I also think it's because I've been rather lonely lately, and I miss getting to know people in addition to kissing and having sex with them. This probably isn't a really healthy combination. 

Now I'm left, once again, wondering what's wrong with me. 

She texted me after I left, saying that she ""regrets being scared and maybe we should've tried kissing.""

I said not to worry about it, that I ""had a lot of shit to figure out when it comes to knowing what I'm looking for right now, and don't wanna confuse you anymore or make you uncomfortable.""

I just let my emotions get the best of me ALOT. I’m insecure sexually with my partner but she’s always made me feel comfortable and loved. In person. I know she had sex toys and all that and has loads more experience than I. I’ll start by pointing out some things that I guess added up to this explosion. So we always said our phones were never a secret and we know each others passwords. A couple weeks ago I was on her instagram and saw she DM’d her ex on Christmas Eve and was upset he didn’t reply “wow X no fucking reply and your online? I bet” keep in mind we dated for probably 6 months broke up for 3 and in that time we broke up she slept with him. And then we got back together and have been a thing for 5 months. My problem is that I should’ve addressed it, and when I waited to talk about it, all I got was “I don’t love x, I’m sorry I won’t talk to him again” two nights ago I planned on spending the night at her house, I wake up early af for work so she typically stays up and snuggles me while she watches TV and we both drift off. She all of a sudden was like “I want to take a bath” okay that’s cool I don’t really care, imma go to sleep to will wonka haha, we’ll she cranks it up, slams the bathroom door and makes a loud noise. I was just sus, I walk into the bathroom and she’s watching porn with her vibrator. So I shut my phone off drive home and went to bed.

Aloha from Maui!

I need your help on this one reddit. My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a year and a half. I love him tremendously and we've had a very healthy relationship since it began.

He lives on the other side of the island from me and the road is kind of a pain in the ass so he and I only see eachother on weekends.  Despite this we still talk every day and keep up connection that way in between visits. This month we happened to have a few conflicts which made it impossible for me to see him for three weekends in a row so I was thrilled when after almost a month I finally got to see him again! When he got to my house he excitedly showed me his new tattoo he had gotten the day before on his left foot which read ""Lily""

My name is not Lily. He does not have a relative named Lily... so who is Lily? That's a great question. She is the 15 year old girlfriend of one of his friends. My boyfriend is 22. So why does he have her name tattooed on his toe? I honestly couldn't tell you. They've been hanging out alot this month while I haven't seen him but he swears nothing has happened between them. He insists they're besties. But YIKES right?

Obviously I hate this life decision. I'm really really curious to hear what you all would do in this situation.

I said life is short, let's do it now. He hesitated and started making excuses why it's not possible. I said ""okay, then I'll go alone"". I opened the train schedule on my phone, there was one leaving in 4 hours. It will take approx. 18 hours. I Started packing, took all the essential stuff and next thing I remember is that I'm in train and some old Russian lady is telling me stories how nice Indian movies were in the past.

I couldn't waste 18 hours doing nothing, started talking to some people, worked on the videos I was going to post, Read obstacle is the way by Ryan Holiday.

I reached St. Petersburg early in the morning, it was super cold, I almost started regretting the impulsive decision, but then I saw this amazing Blonde girl running towards the metro, she missed it. I walked upto her, said ""hey, I know it's random, you look amazing, you should have ran faster"" she started laughing, we exchanged names, she was married, told her that I'm just here for 2 days, let's just have a drink together. She said ""we'll see"" I knew it was a No, but took her WhatsApp anyway. You can't know which number converts to date so.. always be closing.

During my stay in petersburg I talked to more than 70 Girls, it's more than most of the people reading this post have done yet. 

My Logistics were amazing, right in the center, 2 minute walk from the main shopping mall ""Nevsky center"" all I had to do was just start walking towards my apartment and pull was easy. 

Pull 1 - She was a cute university student I met while I was searching for ""some good restaurant"". we clicked instantly, she was super feminine, very receptive. In morning she was in hurry, so we made plans to meet in evening. called her in the evening for drinks, gave the excuse that it's cold outside. we sat in my room showed her some pics on my phone. there was some physicality but she didn't want to go further. I understood it, told her to meet next day for food or something. She left around 9pm. I had another girl coming  at 10, so took a shower and put the beer in the fridge.

Pull 2 - This one was surprising for me, because she was not that receptive when we met during the day, anyway she came and we had some drinks. I took it slow, we watched some Russian drama while laying on my bed. Then after drinking one beer she went to the bathroom and after that it was just happy times. There was lot of Intense tension with this girl, she was amazing in bed, probably one of my favorites.

on day 2  I couldn't even walk because of pain in my knee, I walked too much on first day. took some painkillers but it wasn't getting better. Went to the nearest supermarket to buy something, talked with some girls but it wasn't going anywhere. Thought I'll just text the yesterday's girl. she agreed for plans but canceled on last moment.

Day 3  - It was last day, I had a train back in evening, knee was better so did some approaches, talked with this amazing girl who was also traveling. With her we went to the Kazan cathederal, shot some funny videos, walked with her for 3 hours. Then she left me at the station with a promise of meeting in summer. 

My train ride was crazy, I was super tired from all this Intense gaming. so, thought now I can rest, but god had different plans for me. Near my seat, this cute girl was laying, I noticed that everytime I go to toilet or take something from my bag, she just stares at me without emotion. Even though I was tired I couldn't Ignore the IOIs. so started talking to her. Showed pics on my phone. Makeout. Then told her  ""go to toilet and don't lock the door, we'll talk in private"" it was like 1 AM and everybody was sleeping nobody noticed us. There were many techniques I had to use with these girls, I'll post the full story in details somewhere on a different platform.

I'm not trying to say the emotional connection isn't important, I treasure this a lot. I get told I look like a doll, cute, bambi etc but no one is affectionate physically with me, I'm treated like I'm fragile even when dating. In prior relationships I have had to ask my ex boyfriend if he wanted to take off my clothes and touch me and he responded with ""the thought doesn't cross my mind I like you for other reasons like you're pretty nice and smart. It's what's inside that counts. I'm allowed to be attracted to different body types.""

I don't understand why someone would date me if they didn't want to look at me naked. I know looks are not everything, but most women don't have to ask for this. Sometimes I think if I were bigger than maybe he would have wanted to look at me. I don't even like to wear padded bras though. I'm waif and a bit tall for a girl which I know is not what everyone's likes, but I like how my body is and would just like whoever I am with to at least find the thought of my appealing. I don't care if they look at porn or find other women attractive as long as I feel wanted.

It's not really all about sex, I'd like to be able to just be close to my partner and hold each other, shower, wake up to each other etc. So I need to feel secure in order to be able to be open like this. Once my partner expresses something like how I'm ""not as good as other women visually"" I just can't do this sort of thing anymore, they get upset, the relationship ends. So I guess it would just have been nice to have someone accept me for how I am and want to be intimate with me instead of liking me for ""other"" reasons when I want to be share myself with him. I know I have a lot to offer (I think a lot more than just being pretty, smart, and nice) and I'm happy to share that and take care of them when I'm with someone I love, but I have never felt wanted sexually. Just emotionally and romantically. I feel a bit frustrated and sad, no one has touched or held me in a long time, not even sexually but just lovingly.

I just have horrible anxiety around physical intimacy/sex now, I can't even fathom trying to be intimate I get so anxious and just shut down situations because I don't want to dump this one someone else. I feel really undesirable and unwanted. Like I should just stick to being the nice pretty smart girl and feel lucky someone loves me for who I am inside, but that's the reason most people like me so it is not very unusual for me. I'm not insecure about my breast size and think my body is very nice, I'm just more insecure about this sort of rejection again because of how I look and how ""nice pretty and smart"" I am. I don't like feeling like whoever dates me doesn't even want to look at me naked but is with me for other reasons. I know confidence is the sexiest thing but I just have lost it with this after that happened. If anyone could give any advice about how to ease anxiety around this so it can stop impacting my dating life so much I would appreciate it.

TLDR: My ex said ""the thought doesn't cross my mind I like you for other reasons like you're pretty nice and smart. It's what's inside that counts. I'm allowed to be attracted to different body types."" when I asked him to take off my shirt and if he wants to touch me. After that I didn't feel comfortable with sex/intimacy with him anymore.

This post is part vent, part please help me I'm hopeless (please really help me ha).

The background first: I'm a college dropout from San Francisco (20M) that co-founded an up and coming startup. I'm average-good looking, quite tall, dress well, and am pretty damn funny. Whenever I talk to people about my girl problems, they ask if I'm kidding and tell me I will be fine. The thing is, I went to an all male high school, uh, COVID, and I grew up socially awkward so I didn't really have any dating experience until I decided to leave home in July 2021 and truly live on my own.

I met a few girls through friends but didn't really hit it off with them. Part of it was clearly inexperience so I wasn't too sure what I wanted out of a relationship or how to best go on a date, and another part was that I just didn't really like them as people. Though one of the girls I met in late August I continued to see pretty casually. She (20F) was great to hang around because we had a lot of shared interests and we continued to see each other but it never really got too serious. Because I didn't know exactly what I wanted until recently and she was traveling outside of Cali after her school ended in early December, I held off having the conversation until last week.

So we go out for dinner this past Monday and I ask her where she sees me and her going. As the title of this post implied, she rejected me, which really sucks because I had finally brought up the courage to ask and reached a point where I could see myself spending a lot of time with her. The short of her answer is that I should have said something wayyy sooner and been more serious because she didn't really know if I liked her or not and that her feelings for me had passed some time in November or December. Also she was concerned that with me having left school early and have been relatively successful, I was at differing points in life to her and that there would always be some fundamental disconnect. It was pretty emotional for both of us because we didn't want to see each other upset.

She left me that evening saying that she would be mad if we didn't remain friends since she enjoys spending time with me platonically. I'm totally going to take her up on that offer since we have shared interests, I'm ""over it"" on the romantic side of things, and she's just a very cool person.

That's the story part of this post. I'm ""over it"" mentally speaking --- it sucks but I know it's not the end of the world and I really respect her and why she came to that decision.

But now I need help...

I don't use dating apps like Tinder because I despise casual hookup culture, do not know how to text(!! but can hold my own on a date), and feel like putting your life into like four pictures and two paragraphs makes girls (or guys) create an image of yourself in their head that taints the relationship from day one. What makes it worse is I'm starting to travel a lot so I'm not in places with friends all the time or not in places where I have an easy way to sneak into college parties. I also don't want girls that like me because I'm ""successful"" (gold diggers basically) and also I am truly scared that there are girls that won't like the fundamental disconnect between myself and them.

Re: the travel part, I am willing to make an effort to settle down in a new city or back home if I can find someone that i really like (sweet, wholesome type). Also worth noting that my home base is still SF and the Bay Area, but I will only be there for around 1/3 of this year.

So knowing all this, what would you recommend I do to find someone? If you think dating apps are still the best way to go, how should I frame my profile and how should I best learn to text?

Shane and I have been friends and dated on and off for two years. We broke up for good a few months ago, because I didn't feel like he was invested enough, and when we discussed it he said he didn't have the same feelings for me that he once had, partially because of my personality and partially because of my crazy parents. After this, we agreed to be platonic friends. However, he still texts me things such as, ""I wish you were here to fall asleep with"", ""I want to cuddle you"" or ""I love you"" (because he says he does, as a friend).

We call for an hour or so every night, and hang out weekly, which usually involves doing an activity together, or cuddling in the car watching Netflix (he gave me his mom's login information). He also constantly tells me how attractive I am, which I usually brush off with an ""I know,"" or ""thank you."" and if I ever wanted to be friends with benefits, he'd be down. It's been months of no nsfw stuff though, so I think he's gotten the hint. He also invites me to spend holidays with him and his family, and even wants to move in with me when I turn 18, since he knows I'm looking for a roommate. He wants to cook dinner for me soon, and introduce me to his family (including some extended family members). We also have a marriage pact, when I'm 25 and he's 28, if we're both single. He's asked if we could move up our wedding, and says if we end up getting married, it would be really nice. He (who works minimum wage) spend $100 on my gift along with a heartfelt card, and spend $20-$40 on everyone else he was getting gifts for.

However, we both talk about liking other people, and he's always trying to suggest me good dating sites. Occasionally he'll send me girls with really horrible bios from tinder to make me laugh, so I know he's looking for romantic people too. All my friends think he likes me romantically, or is using me as a back up option, but why move in with your backup option? I'm not sure if I'm being used here, or he just genuinely doesn't know what normal friends do, or he has feelings for me and doesn't know it.
