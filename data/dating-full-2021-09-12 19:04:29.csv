I have had a crush on this girl for a long time, and I am pretty sure she knows it. At some point I realized I had been friendzoned and that she has started dating her ex. It was hard to accept, but I chose to keep a distance from her, which helped my heart break a lot. But it is not easy to keep a distance from her. I would not mind just being her friend, but I don't think she treats me as a friend for the following reasons:

\- 3-4 times she has contacted me to ask if I wanted to walk with her and go out and have food. I wanted to avoid this, but I was desparate enough to say yes. The thing is that when she asks me, it feels like she is trying to manipulate me into saying yes. She compliments me and explains how much she wants to see me. But as soon as we have seen each other she changes entirely - it feels like she just wanted my attention/show me that she is in control, and that I am not strong enough to ignore her.

\- When I have tried to avoid her for long enough she suddenly sends me really sweet messages that makes me feel great but, but when I reply, it takes her between 1-6 days to reply again. I think it's weird since she starts the conversation every single time, and it's not like I wrote something wrong (as you know, she has done it several times).

It revives my heart break when we have a conversation going on and when I am waiting for her replies. As I said, I have tried to avoid her, but it is not easy when she reaches out that way. Can someone help me explain her behavior; is it normal ""friend behavior"" from her side, or is she taking advantage of my attention because she can (since she knows I like her)?

People say break ups are for the best, but I have grown so much since, I don’t see why we wouldn’t be much more successful. We had so much in common, had the same career, and both smart + driven. We had the kind of relationship that would exhaust most people, we were constantly doing something productive. 

In my opinion, permanent breakups are for the best when: You share vastly different principles, you have different goals in life, you have no hobbies or career in common.

When I look back in my relationship so many of the issues really stemmed from me being insecure, inpatient and most importantly, having no control over my emotions.

I used to stress out my partner a lot because I would always get very anxious about things. I have since worked an incredible amount on meditating and completely changing my thought patterns where I have become one of the calmest people in my circle. It has greatly benefited me personally as well but it would’ve made an incredible difference in my past relationship. Getting a weird pain? It’s probably nothing. And if it is cancer, why freak out? Might as well give yourself the best experience by staying chill throughout this worst case scenario.

I used to have hyperbolic views on things, and expressed them ad-nauseum. I have since put an incredible amount of work into understanding how I make other people feel, and how to reframe every situation and information in a way that considers a lot more nuance. I rarely see things as all bad or all good anymore. 

I used to be very negative and complain a lot. I realized that after doing a lot of post-relationship auditing, and it has slowly transformed the friendship I have with my friends. Whenever I have the urge to feel negative about something I try and reframe it in such a way that I can see positives. I try and be as grateful as I can for all the other things. I am also very lucky to have phenomenal friends, a great job, and being a healthy able bodied person.

I used to be very unorganized, lazy and low effort. I feel like a kid who has finally become a man. I make checklists for things, I prepare for the day ahead, I organize and plan events myself. I don’t drink any alcohol anymore (I learned to be fun sober around drunk friends). 

I took on so much responsibility for the relationship failing, that it led me to work so hard on myself. She has her flaws too, but none of them are Reddit-level flaws (people’s stories are wild). I didn’t feel respected at times, but who would respect someone with little follow through who never took anything seriously?

Having said all that, I can’t help but be negative about one thing: The fact that I might have permanently set myself up to settle because I blew it with a statistical anomaly. For reference, I’m picky, and it took me 10 years after my first girl to find her. I just don’t jump on anything that walks.

I have given many girls a chance, and I just can’t click with them. Confidence, athleticism, creativity/curiousity and a shared love for  engineering is what I crave, on top of being someone who is attractive to me. I’m shocked how rare that package is. I send out likes rarely and when I do it’s more so because I just want any match, not because they fulfill what I want. Covid really challenged my mental health but I wish I would’ve met her after making all these mistakes. I think once a girl sees you be mentally weak, it’s understandably very hard for her to change their opinion of you. As far as she is concerned, A relationship with me brings a lot of negativity,stress, anxiety and being disorganized.

Most of these women have been hurt and if they’re comfortable talking about that hurt with you then they probably already trust that you’re not like that.

I haven’t said what I *am* in the market for explicitly, which is ideally a relationship, because it’s very early days and I don’t want to put that much pressure on either of us. But I’ve made it clear, I think, that I’m not down to have sex and then just never speak again, or do anything too casual. 

However, my humour is quite rude. It has been since I was a teenager. When my friend googled something using a private tab yesterday, I didn’t even think twice before I’d automatically made a joke about porn. It’s not like that’s *all* I talk about or joke about, but it is a part of my humour. 

I’ve been talking to this guy for a few months, and we had a really fun first date about two weeks ago. We didn’t kiss, but we were able to talk continuously for literally 6 hours straight and we were having a fun time. 
He mentioned something about staying with me yesterday, (because I’m travelling for our second date and renting a hotel room for myself, so I think the option to have sex on the second date is pretty obvious to both of us. 

My best friend is engaged and is very much a ‘wait an hour to text back’ kinda girl, and absolutely swears by all the ‘rules’ that people typically consider outdated nowadays - but it clearly worked for her, since she is happily engaged in her early 20’s. 

She knows that I think I could really like this guy and see something happening with him - but she’s also making me really worried that my sexual humour will make him see me as only a hook up (despite us both claiming we don’t want that). 

Like, he made a joke about pineapple on pizza, and I made a joke similar to ‘I’ll still hope you fuck me on the second date, but I’ll be wary of you’ (once he’d already mentioned staying the night). 

She thinks I’m totally ruining my chances with him, and I’m trying hard to keep my jokes and comments more PG than usual, but it’s an automatic part of my personality and it’s kind of difficult to.

“I will say that men, for all their flaws, are equal opportunity daters in a way that women are not. While they will still lust for the hottest woman around, they’ll ultimately marry someone in their league, which, empirically, is not always that attractive.”

But then after thinking about it and reading that I realized that I’m really not picky. I’m just trying to date my equal, someone who ranks the same as I do based on everything but mainly physical attractiveness but those guys aren’t interested in me because it seems they’re always seeking women 4x more attractive than themselves. 

Well, I don’t get this. If I was one of those women, I’d want my equal, I wouldn’t lower my standards. Just like now, when I get approached and am showed interest from guys, who I don’t find to be my equal, it’s an automatic NO, no questions asked.

So when I read that statement and I was like ok I guess this makes sense.

Other people are shy just like you so they're probably too scared to make the first move, just like you"". holy shit i miss her bro

Like I had this experience last week where I was at my first frat party ever and this girl was flirting with me we danced for a bit and that was it bc I was tired. And the next day my homie was like ""BROOO you just danced with her? WTF you should've kissed her she was so into you!!""

And I was just like ""what the fuck you can just do that?!"" and he's talking about yeah, once he knows a girl is into him he'll just be like ""wanna kiss?"" and shit will happen. 

And my biggest fear is that like, I'll misread someone just being friendly with me as them being into me and try that, and they'll be like ""oh this mf weird as shit"" and go tell all their friends and then no one will ever fw me ever again. 

Like I just don't wanna hurt anyone or make anyone feel uncomfortable and that, coupled with some light self-esteem issues is what's been holding me back I think. Like, it's hard for me to even fathom a woman being attracted to me despite the fact that ITS HAPPENED BEFORE, and off of that I'm too scared to tell someone I'm into them because I'm scared of what could happen or how I could make them feel if I mess something up.

The only time I've ever been with a girl (2019), she came up and introduced herself to me, took me to her dorm, literally EVERYTHING was done by her. I didn't have sex w/ her bc I was rlly scared of STDs and she said she understood but kinda ghosted me sooo yeahhhh yikes. 

I've always been kinda shy to hook up with a random person, but at this point, after being in quarantine for so long I'm so fucking starved that i dont even care anymore. 

I just need to know what's the best way to get to that point. Where do you generally meet people who are into that kind of thing? And what is the best and safest way to bring that up into a conversation? 

Like,, it's partially a self-esteem issue that's making this hard for me, but I know I'm cute I'm confident enough. It's just I don't really know enough about this kind of thing to not be a little nervous. Sorry if this makes no sense I'm trying to explain a lot of deep dark shit about how I feel in concrete terms and that's really hard.

I got this woman’s number awhile back.  She works at a big retail store that is always busy so I never have a ton of time to talk to her.  She is a single mom of three kids so she doesn’t have a lot of free time.  

I am basically a traveling salesman that works in that store about once a month.  Every time I see her we exchange pleasantries, make small talk for the minute or so we have together.  She never mentions a boyfriend or that she is dating anyone.  Admittedly a couple of times I have been tongue tied around her because she is so damn beautiful.  

She shows some signs of physical attraction like eyebrow flashes and eyes widening when she sees me.  Consistent eye contact from afar for example.  This morning for example we locked eyes probably like 6 times within the first hour of work to the point it was clear that we were checking each other out.  From the time I got her number until now about six months have passed.  Texted her twice, no response.  

A couple times I asked her out for a drink she has said things like “I might be able to do that but I’m really busy” or “I’ll let you know”.  


I’m starting a new job on Tuesday so I will not be seeing her anymore and at the end of my shift today I said hey if you ever want to get that drink let me know.  She replied with I’ll let you know lol.  

I’m guessing she isn’t into me but I wish she would just flat out reject me instead of leaving the door open for some hope.

It's something we've been doing since fall 2019. We might not be bf/gf, but it's been such a bonding experience between us. And last January, I started developing feelings for her. 

Just yesterday, just before my sales management class was starting, my brother called me and I heard her voice on his phone. I had some time so I walked down to her and I felt so amazing in her embrace. She told me that she felt my heartbeat and how it was pounding. I even asked her if we can have a heart-to-heart hug. She said yes. It was my first time having a heart-to-heart hug. It was so magical. I honestly wanted this moment to last forever. And I was still euphoric both during the class and when I got back to the dorm. 

It didn't stop there. A few hours ago, I was at the cafeteria and she showed up. And this time, she was so excited for another hug. Immediately after embracing, we were just swaying and spinning with our eyes closed. I had to be dreaming, right? After all, there's no way I actually experienced a heavenly moment such as this. But Nope. This was real! In case you're wondering why I love this beautiful angel so much, here's your answer.

I met this girl during the summer that my best friend and his girlfriend introduced to me. We met at a festival in person, but we had talked on video before (I live abroad, and she lives in my home country). At the festival, we had a good time, and I asked her out. We didn’t hook up, we just made out. But she seemed really nice, so I’m continuing talking to her on instagram.

Now, the thing that I am confused about: we talk on Instagram all the time, we write long messages, because we talk about a lot of things at the same time. We might write like 7 up to 8 or 9 long messages. The problem that I am struggling to understand is the frequency. She writes once every 3 up to 5-6 hours. In the weekends is even longer, she might write me only once a day and reply the next morning.

She knows that I won’t be seeing her until December probably. But my hopes got high, because her best friend told me that she liked me.

Now I want to ask for your opinion: do you think she is interested in me genuinely, or she is just being nice, and hopes that one day I’ll just send a message that she doesn’t need to reply?
If the latter is the case, what do you think I should do to get my mind off of her?

Hey everyone, I have a question. I’m gonna preface this question with a story to help with understanding why I’m having trouble here.

So back in middle school, I met this amazing girl. She was super funny, nice, and attractive. We had a really strong friendship since we were in a few classes together. At that time, I was super short (shorter than her) and I really wasn’t the same person I am today. So middle school finally wraps up, and since she and I attended a public middle school, the next step would be to attend our district’s public high school. The only problem was that I attended a private high school while she attended the public high school.

One noticeable event that happened was that, maybe a month into high school, the public high school hosted a movie night. My best friend from elementary and middle school invited me to go (since the school and his house were minutes down the road). I went and enjoyed it, but I did see the girl. We exchanged hugs a few times and talked a bit. We even took a picture, which I still have today. That was the last time I talked her.

High school wrapped up a few months ago and now I’m a freshman in university. I had seen her briefly working at a grocery store, and she’s the exact same. I’m one of those kids that drastically changed in high school, not middle school, so even without a mask on, there’s no way she could regognize me.

One day (maybe three days ago), I saw her profile pop up in the “people you may know” section on Instagram. I felt pretty confident and decided to request to follow her. Not even a day later (maybe twelve hours or less), she accepts the follow request. And follows me back. And likes my graduation post from four months ago. This freaked the heck out of me. Why would she like that post? Since then, I’ve changed quite a bit. I joined sports and became really good at school. I’ve grown in height and maturity. I’ve never been in a relationship, but I want it to be with someone special like this girl. I don’t know where she’s going for school or what she’s majoring in.

So here are my questions now that you know my situation:
1) Should I like one of her posts back since she liked one of my old ones?
2) How should I start a conversation with her?

I’m really struggling with this one. I want to slide in to her DMs, but I genuinely don’t know how to even start a conversation with her. I’m totally okay with just saying “screw it” and sending something, but I don’t want to mess this one up. If anyone sees this, please help! May Reddit work its magic!

She wasn't looking for a relationship at the very beginning but we got along pretty well. We usually hang out once / twice a week.

We did all the couple things together. e.g. Long walks at the beach, hanging out with our friends, good sex, travelling, meeting her family, buying matching shoes ... etc

Recently we went on a trip and she told me that I have been a casual date and she only likes me as a friend. She wanted to end the 'relationship' and be friends. I have got rejected before and I was always happy with it because I am not compatible with those girls and they were respectful. But this girl destroyed me by saying she never had any feelings for me yet we have done so much together. She said she would do all the same things with her guy friends (except for having sex). She even thought of moving in together. I never fall for girls easily and I only did this time because I felt like our feelings were mutual. I never saw this coming especially she brought it up during the trip.

Her reason of dong all those couple things with me is that she has to try everything to see if she is really interested and it is normal to go on dates for a few months to see if things work out. During the trip I was super upset and she asked if I could hide my feelings as I was omitting negative energy. She got frustrated since she thinks it was a good reason to reject me. She was like 'You once said you would be happy if I am happy, why can't you be happy for me right now?"" 

Honestly I would be happy to be friends and move on within a day if she said we are not compatible / I am too immature (any solid reasons).

I went on a first date with a guy recently. We went bowling and had dinner after. I felt like we were connecting and had a lot in common. He suggested we go for a drink in a theme bar and afterwards invited me to his apartment.

One thing led to another and things got physical. I didn't want to have sex but we did other things. He came after like 20 seconds and apologised. I didn't care because I took it as a compliment. We lay in bed and talked about various topics for a while and then I went home.

Since then I have been ghosted.

I feel hurt because I honestly thought we had a really fun date and had lots in common. We have the same sense of humor and interests. I figure he must have been attracted to me because he invited me back to his place.

I am just curious if maybe him cuming quickly had anything to do with the ghosting. Could he be embarrassed? Or maybe he thinks I'm too easy.

So I have no idea how to tell if someone’s being suspicious or not. 

But seriously I think she’s way out of my league, but also I have no idea if I’m gauging myself properly. 

I swiped right on this chick, she’s like 14years older than me. I thought she was out of my league, but it doesn’t hurt to try or smth. We matched. We started talking. It was a live chat too, and she didn’t seem botty as she’d never strayed off topic. 

Look I don’t want to break any trust here, in case she’s actually a real person interested in me so I won’t post screenshots. Here’s a list of things that makes me conflicted about whether or not she’s legitimate. 

Suspicious:
- she called me ‘cute’ early in our conversation, although that was in response to me telling her that I’d never dated anyone prior

- she messaged first. Like, maybe I’m just an insecure piece of shit but it’s hard to believe that someone like that would like me enough to message first? Granted, I’ve had pretty girls my age message me, and we end up getting on pretty well, but this one’s 14 years older than me and uhh it’s rare for someone like that to be interested in someone younger? I think? Especially in WLW situations? Clearly I have a thing for older women, but that’s a whole other rabbit hole)

- mild sexting. She mentioned wanting to use a vibrator passingly. 

- “you wont be single for long, I’ll be scooping you up” I was super flattered but also,,, out of my league??

- she’s a hot, Caucasian lady in her mid-30s. I’m a fresh high school graduate from Asia who refuses to leave her room without at least some eyeliner on. 

Not suspicious:

- we talked about hobbies and such, and bonded over that

- banter - we talked about Cheerios. 

- we talked about what we were looking for out of a dating app

Look I get emotionally attached easily, and then I start getting suspicious and having doubts. You don’t need to tell me if you think she’s cat fishing me (although that would be super appreciated), just maybe a few signs of someone who isn’t actually serious about a relationship?

(Also I tried running her pictures through a reverse image search and it came out empty so… they were suspiciously blurry though)

Plus the fact that I share very little interests  with women in general. I don't care about dogs, cats, hiking, camping and drinking wine. I like heavy metal, crude humor , action movies, running, lifting weights and eating a lot of crap.

He’s going through a custody battle at the moment so I know a lot is on his mind. The night before he canceled the trip (said his mom may have covid) but he still wanted to hang one night that weekend. We did and he totally was not present during the entire date. Kept apologizing saying that he had court earlier and his head just isn’t in the right space. I kept trying to wrap up the date and say we can hang another time but he said he enjoyed being with me and wanted to continue. We ended up playing a question card game where we both reveal some really personal stuff and would really only feel comfortable sharing with someone you trust. After the game I asked if he wanted me to leave and he apologized and said yes I’m sorry I just need a little space. I said is this the last time we’re gonna see eachother and he said no, we were just supposed to have a lovey weekend together and I feel deeply connected to you. I waited a week and checked in letting him know I was there for him. It was a short convo. Then waited another week and reached out mentioning I felt like I was left hanging. Things were so good and wanna respect your space but did something change? He apologized for leaving me in the dark and there were things he wanted to tell me that not but didn’t know how. He’s not sure if he’s control of his emotions enough and can’t guarantee it doesn’t happen again and he feels horrible about that night. At the same time he doesn’t wanna say goodbye or end things. I responded saying that I was confused because things were going well and did a complete 180 in one night and we didn’t speak until I reached out.

I wrote something and need a place to share it. Sometimes I get lost in thought about past or future romances.


I remember when I first met you, I could hear the gentle breeze rustle the leaves of the nearby tree. A shade of orange covered the terrain as the evening sunset approached. We looked at one another in the eye and I noticed you had a slight smile pursed upon your lips. Your eyes could tell a story: the blue depths of the ocean, the green foliage of the forest, or the brown soil which creates life. I got lost in them for a moment, but you brought me back to my senses as your voice radiated warmth. The cool weather no longer had any effect on me, as if blanketed by your presence. This was the beginning of our story; a tale that transcends two beings, almost as if we were one entity.

The years flew by, time’s wheel spun rapidly. Weddings, funerals, birthdays, anniversaries. Things weren’t always easy, but as long I knew you stood beside me, time felt like a gift. One of which I now felt like was in short supply. I made sure to appreciate each moment we spent together as fleeting as it was. I’m reminded of the small things we did together, the jokes that cheered us up, the places we visited, and the sights we saw. Your touch was as comforting as always, your smile as bright the day I met you. I wished the wheel would come to a halt, time would stand still, and I could feel your loving embrace for eternity.

Years became decades, I became weaker. Soon, I didn’t have the strength to stand. I looked up at your eyes, they told me the same story as always, however the last chapter was approaching. I took a moment to feel the your hand clasped with mine, I felt complete. Your wrinkle-clad face was as beautiful as the day laid eyes upon it so many years ago. With my last bit of strength I stroked your cheek and smiled as I remembered the gentle breeze and sunset of the day I met you. A tear trickled down my cheek.

I awoke to the same tear and could feel the precipitation on my skin. I was filled with melancholy, followed by inspiration. Even though our time together was just a dream, I knew you were out there somewhere. I wiped my cheek and smiled, as I gazed at the visage of the sunrise, for our story had yet to be written.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1003943,public,self,"I admit it, I’m lonely and it feels good to say.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pn3gb9/i_admit_it_im_lonely_and_it_feels_good_to_say/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

She was a bit flirty with me and I returned the favor. Asked her for her number and she gave it to me and then later that night I asked her on a date. She told that she would be free the following Sunday (today). 

Told her cool I will get back to you on a place and tell me what you think. Monday comes and I ask her about this cafe and she said she really wanted to go because she has always wanted to try it. We proceeded to talk for several hours after. Tuesday we go back to work and I hadn't hear from her most of the day. Reached out later in the afternoon. She responded back. I responded and then radio silence. Same thing Wednesday. Thursday the same thing happened so I reached out and asked if she was still interested because she seemed to be somewhat withdrawn and not interested in talking.

She informed me that she has a second job at night and has just been really busy and stressed with work. I respected that and left her alone Friday and Saturday other than to confirm the time and place on Saturday.

Our date was today. She showed up about 10 minutes late (but we live in the city and that can happen with trains). She informed me that she was kind of hung over from the night before which I thought was weird but it is what it is. First few minutes were a bit awkward because she didn't seem like her normal peppy self like last week. We got out coffees (which she let me pay for). I went to find a table and she said she wanted to walk around the park near us instead.

We walked around the park and talked and the conversation flowed pretty well. She'd bring things up and ask about me, my life, work, etc. and I returned in kind. We eventually got to a bench and sat down and talked for the remainder of our date.

However, when we got to the bench she wouldn't look at me when talking at all. The conversation was still quality but she would only look forward. Sometimes we'd brush against each other accidentally and she would move herself back to a small distance away from me. She would ask me questions about another girl I dated (who was also Chinese if that matters for the story) and when she asked me if I was currently talking to girls I told her that (and we're part of a group to make new friends for context - that's how we met) I was talking to other girls that were part of the group as friends but she was the only one who I had any intention of dating. To which she responded that she didn't care. She also told me that I should have sent her a picture of where I was when I got to the spot so she didn't have to do it. Honestly, didn't know that was even a thing. Normally people just text me when they get to the spot and I call them. So that was my bad.

She did still seem to enjoy talking and was laughing quite a bit but I suppose that can be faked just to appear nice and not make it awkward.

Towards the end I asked her if she would be interested in going out again next weekend and she responded with ""uhh maybe"". Which is generally a tell tale sign that they aren't really into you.

As we approached the train station and we were saying goodbye she went into give me a hug which really through me for a loop consider just a minute ago she wasn't sure if she wanted to go on a date with me again. idk if this was sympathy hug or what but it felt weird and out of place. After that she texted me a couple minutes later to say that she had a really good time.

It seemed like such a mixed bag of signals in a 5 minute period. Am I crazy for thinking that these signals are mixed? If she said uhh maybe and then just said goodbye I would understand she was interested but it just seems a bit strange to say uhh maybe then give me a hug and tell me you had a good time?

Because I am a moron I responded to her text saying ""I had a good time as well and I really do hope I can see you again. But if I can be totally honest with you I felt like I was getting a lot of mixed signals (for all the reasons I just posted above). I'm still interested in you and would love to continue going out with you but it is a bit hard for me to understand exactly how you feel. I'm not sure if you are unsure or nervous about our date and just need some time to process how you feel but if you aren't interested I don't want to spend the time and emotional investment in someone who doesn't feel the same way. It's fine if you are unsure and I don't mind giving you space to think about it but if you definitely sure that you don't want to continue on please let me know.""

Which she read and hasn't responded (although she is doing tutoring tonight so she could just be busy)

So what do you guys think - is it a lost cause? Should I follow up with her tomorrow if she doesn't respond? Am I crazy for thinking that her actions are kind of mixed? Am I just an idiot?

I had a girlfriend until six weeks ago. We broke up because we just didn't have the same spark that we used to have when we first started dating a few years ago, mainly because of the coronavirus and the quarantine and how long we spent time apart from each other, even though at this moment the quarantine is over in my country.

Not even video calls made it easier, but at least we broke up on good terms (we are still friends) and we wish all the luck and success in the world to each other, but since we broke up, i started trying (a week after the break up) to go out with again by meeting some new girls at the club and in a way i was surprised to see how easy it was for me to get back on the ""game"" again, but for some reason, after going on the first official date today (with a girl i met 6 days ago), and even though it was great, i felt like i am kind of lost and i don't really know what the hell is going on in my mind.

It's not like i still have feelings for my ex-girlfriend (because i don't anymore, only as a friend), but i just can't see myself getting back to dating again as easily as i thought i did.

Like i said, the date went well and she was pretty cool and interesting and i can tell she found me interesting as well, but it seems like i am forcing myself to get back into this whole relationship thing without me actually putting thought into it, so i am afraid that i could end up emotioanlly hurting someone since it seems like i am not being true to myself.

Before this date, i slept with another girl two-three weeks (wasn't a date, just a casual meeting in a night out) ago and even then i felt like i was still forcing myself to go through all of this.

I think deep down inside of me, i have been in a relationship for so long, that after ending it all, a part of a routine in my life just ended and i am somehow trying to get routine back, without actually caring if this ends up well for me or not, not to mention that i also dn't want to end up hurting my date as well if it lead to something really serious.

I was relatively short, skinny, socially awkward, poor, had acne and crooked teeth. Because of this, I was undesirable to the opposite sex and hence didn't have a lot of relationship experience. Obviously, that messes with you.

I grew into my own in my thirties. Throughout the years I managed to grow to average height, fix my teeth and acne, gain muscle and cut fat (I was 9,5 % body fat when I last checked with my dietician, with a visible 6-pac), get a lucrative career, developed my social skills. I consider myself to be a 6, maybe 7 out of 10 now. I atteibute some of my success to luck but I also worked extremely hard to better myself.

With my newfound confidence, I decided to go on Tinder. I got a couple of matches which turned into a few dates and eventually a relationship with my current GF. I was thirsty AF as you might imagine. I didn't care if we were a good couple, I was deprived of love for such a long time that I jumped head first into the relationship.

Fast foward 3 years later, I'm having doubts as to my decision. My GF is wonderful to me. She takes care of me, is supportive, loves me and forgives my for sometimes being an idiot. That being said, I feel that something is missing. I have this sinking feeling of missing out in my earlier years. I was never the popular jock. I never got to have sex with a different hot girl every other day. I feel a strong urge to fill this gap.

I'm considering ending my relationship and in favor of having a bunch of one night stands and eventually staring other relationships. I am deeply ashamed of my desires. My GF doesn't deserve this. She loves me and I would break her heart if I were to leave her for something this egoistic. I'm the worst for trying to leverage my position to satisfy mu urges, knowing fully well that it'll hurt her.

Broke up, overall had a good, close relationship with lots of common and lots of vulnerability, but both had unresolved trauma to deal with and had been projecting onto one another which was difficult at times. I felt I had been improving and thought things were good, he apparently hadn’t. I did beg at the breakup, and did suggest it was a cycle/pattern he was in (we had a runner-chaser dynamic when emotional). He didn’t like that, and I get why. Anyway, I know he’s been on some dating apps (friends have seen him and asked why). Before we got together he was barely using them, a relationship years before me was pretty bad for him (he was married, she cheated) and he didn’t deal with that before me. I was the first girlfriend after that. He doesn’t have a history of being too eager about women/dating anyway, and he has good character so I’m not really worried about how he is interacting with people on there. I think he mostly just has them as a distraction, but I could be wrong. I’m not sure I’m ready to date, I’m still holding on but not reaching out. We haven’t spoken much in a month. I’m giving him space. But he did tell me he still wants me in his life and has offered to show me his new truck he got sometime. I guess I’m wondering, would it be helpful to try and get on the apps and have him see me? I know that’s in the realm of playing games, I just don’t know what to do. I’ve deactivated everything but Instagram, but archived all my posts and never share anything. He knows I used to use social media for validation a lot and I’m not doing that right now. In a way, I want him to wonder what I’m doing. And I don’t want to post like I’m having the time of my life either. He’s got more of an avoidant attachment style, so I’m not sure if making a dating profile would make him want to reach out again or not or if it would trigger him, and I don’t want to do that either.

Please only kind responses, my heart is hurting but I’m doing the best I can to be both considerate of myself and him.

This means that even if this woman isn’t available and you’re also not available, in the back of a man’s mind, they’ll be open to whatever chance they get to be with this friend whenever their current commitments dissolve. 

I personally found this to be a bit odd, but after asking my boyfriend, he agreed. 

How he put it was that he could very well maintain a friendship with a woman who he is attracted to for years to come, but there’s no way he could just see her as a friend. Attraction will always be lurking in the background and whenever the opportunity arises to be with this friend, he’ll gladly take it. 

I on the other hand could be friends with an attractive guy and only ever categorize him as a friend. I think the same goes for most girls. 

So to my guys, are you all capable of just being friends with a girl who you’re attracted to?

I wanted to do it at the end of a late night walk since late night walks since late night walks are her hobbies  and I want to do it in person for my confidence 


First time I asked her to hangout was in the summer I said I would take the train to come see her she said she can’t because it’s her last weekend with her family before collage starts and she wants to  hang out with her family. I had my doubts but she actually come uni the following Friday so she was being honest. 


The thing is I never get alone time with this girl since we share the same friends so right now I thought it was only me and this girl back in collage since Everyone else is coming back Wednesday. 

So I’m like this is the prefect time to ask her out since nobody else is here. 

I sent a message around 7pm saying I’m running some errands right now do you want to go on a walk after I’m done. Of course I’m asking her on a date at  the end of the walk. 

She says she’s busy and might not be able to go and she didn’t know I was back in collage she asked me when did I come back. She said I should message her after the errands regardless. 

I did message her after the errands she didn’t reply for ages then she reply’s and saids sorry I was in the cinema. This is so confusing because I though nobody else was here in collage since we share the same friends. The only person it could be is this one guy she talks to who I don’t who’s my biggest competitor and if it’s that true that means I’ve basically lost. Since that sounds like a date if it was just them two but I don’t have proof I just don’t know who else could it be 

Anyway I message her back saying that’s fine I’m still around town this was 12pm so we can still do it now if your not tried. She said she’s tied and wants to go to rest. 

I just don’t believe it firstly she used the out I give her not another excuse. Secondly she never sleeps at this time she always sleeps around 4 am. Thirdly she says she hates being alone and will always be around other people she don’t care how late it gets she says she hates herself. So she most likely want to hangout with the person she want cinema with and if I’m correct and it is this guy then I’m  basically finished. 

I’m not upset that she choose another guy ( if it is since I don’t have proof yet) it’s her choice she can do what she wants I’m just upset that I wasn’t fast enough I’ve know her a whole semester I should have already asked her and I like this girl a lot so it just makes sad I really don’t want to loose her to another guy I would rather she says no to my date offer then me being too late. 


What do I do now? Should I try and plan a walk for Monday night. The thing is I’m starting to feel like she don’t want to  hangout with me and if that’s the case I don’t want to try for the third time I feel like I’m being desperate and annoying to her. I feel like she should reach out this time. But if I don’t reach out before Wednesday it’s basically over for me all my friends are coming back and we will do group activities and I will never get alone time with her. What should I do?
