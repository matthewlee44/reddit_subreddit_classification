0,q95oku,1634362052,I need advice on my girlfriend.,"Me and my girlfriend started dating a month ago and talked for about 2 months before that. She has a guy “best friend” who is also a really good friend of mine and he is the reason why we’re dating. However they have this really close relationship where they’ve spent nights just having deep convos and she tells him everything personal. She really isn’t open to me with the personal things and I’m never the first person she comes to for advice, it’s either him or her other friends she goes to first. I’m not jealous of their friendship because I don’t envy it or wish they didn’t have it. I’m glad they have that, I just worry that me and my girlfriend never have that trust between one another because like I said she never really tells me anything personal unless I ask and doesn’t go in too deep, we’ve stayed up late talking but about nothing personal like her and her “best friend” do. I’m worried our relationship doesn’t advance farther because of this. Like I said I don’t envy it but since I feel some of y’all might question but when they were much younger they did like each other but as of when we started talking I know her “best friend” doesn’t like her like that and what she’s said she doesn’t either.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q95oku/i_need_advice_on_my_girlfriend/
1,q95r2s,1634362376,I want to create an app for long term relationships. Here are some features I came up with.,"Here are some things I came up with:
-It has to be a paid service.
-Men should only have a very limited number of swipes a day, since otherwise they just swipe on every girl with the hopes that one swipes back. 
-Women should be free to swipe as much as they want.
- Both should get penalties for not writing back. This will have a stronger effect on women. 
-There should be an option to end a conversation where you have to give a reason instead of getting a penalty. It should have at least 50 characters (I just picked a random number). 
-You should see the description of a person first.
-Profiles have to have a description.
-There should be a limit of matches you can have at any given time. Your profile should disappear for everyone once you matched perhaps just 5 times. 

I hope to reach a state where both women and men only get very few matches, and therefore they have to focus on these few matches a lot. You have to explain to the other person if they are not right for you. 
Other apps should be for hookups, while this app should aim at having a small customer base and its business mode should be to attract new customers through word of mouth. 

When the app opens it should maybe start with the results of a study:

When people have the choice between six chocolates, they find it easy to find their preferred one and they are very happy with their choice afterwards. 
If they have to choose between 20 different chocolates they get choice paralysis and end up unhappier when they finally make a choice. 

The name of the app could be Chocolate choice.

For the tech savvy:
-back to back encryption
-messages are not saved on private servers
-highly privatized",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q95r2s/i_want_to_create_an_app_for_long_term/

4,q95xnv,1634363219,"I was writing a letter to my GF as the last ""make it or break it"" of our relationship. Writing it made me realize...welcome to my nightmare","Here is the letter:

I am writing this due to a big conversation about our relationship that I’ve been wanting to have. It is too much for me to effectively communicate in the heat of the moment so the only way I can effectively organize all my thoughts is to write it all down like this. I love you and I cherish the times we have spent together. That is why I am giving you this so we can try to work for a better tomorrow. Although we have tried to progress on some of our issues together for the past year, it seems like things have actually been going in the opposite direction since we moved in together. It is getting harder to feel like this is an equal partnership and it is a frustration that has been building up inside of me.  Sometimes it leaks out and hurts you, and I am sorry. 

We need to work on how attached you are to me. It seems like you are afraid to be away from me outside of work, and that is not healthy for you or me. I feel smothered like we’re attached at the hip. Then there’s the issue where you emotionally lash out at me if I separate from you, which doesn’t feel great either. I want you to feel comfortable by yourself. I want you to feel comfortable in your own home. 

Another issue is that your level of codependency seems to be growing higher. Maybe we’re both to blame for that, as I enable you to be that way. I feel like I am your dog to go fetch things as you ask me to do most tasks for you. I do almost everything, including cooking, cleaning, and sometimes part of the one chore you volunteered for. In doing all of this for you, I am feeding into a loop of enabling you to grow more codependent. I am happy to cook for you, but I just don’t know how to take it when you won’t eat an entire dish I’ve prepared for you because it’s missing one thing you like to put on it. It also does not feel good when you expect me to drop everything in the middle of dinner to go get it or you just won’t eat. You could tell me to just not cook for you, and maybe I should do that, but I am worried you would not take care of yourself. I want you to be cared for and healthy. 

I also feel like I am the only one holding up our date nights. I always have an idea for us to try on my nights, but you are always starting to say you don’t have a plan for your nights. It makes me feel like only one side is putting in effort. I know you can think of something! Expand your comfort zone and open your imagination, but don’t forget the idea can be a really simple at-home thing! I understand that it’s harder for you now that you don’t have money to spend on date nights. 

This leads me to my next point, which is that another thing I feel is unequal is our handling of the bills. You don’t have the money to pay your half of the bills anymore. I’ve been trying to help you get your finances in order and will continue to help you, but please understand that you can’t afford everything you want, and you can’t afford to take days off or leave early just because you feel like it. I also need you to understand that you can’t fulfill your spending urges through me either, or that will hurt me as well, which in the end, will hurt us both.

These next couple of paragraphs might get a little harder. We have a bit of a problem with emotional manipulation in our relationship. I try to do my best to be a good partner, but sometimes it feels like I’m chasing a goal that’s always moving. Sometimes you get upset, or act angry, or accuse me of something (like cheating), and use that to get me to do what you want because I want to keep you happy, or I’m afraid of you getting even more upset. It is not fair to me when you do things like get mad at me and say I don’t care because I didn’t do one certain thing for you, like buy a matching bracelet with you, as if everything else I did for you that day didn’t matter. It’s as if nothing I ever do for you matters because when you don’t get what you want, you’ll throw that all away in a loss of control over your anger. Sometimes you put me through tests where you see if I’ll do what you want without you having to tell me, then when I don’t do the thing you wanted, it must be a sign I don’t love you. It isn’t because I don’t love you. It’s because I want you to get stronger. I must also say that there is a slight physical abuse problem in our relationship, like when you intentionally hit me in the balls. I legitimately flinch at you sometimes, which is not a good thing for us. I never have the intention of hurting you, but there are times that you have the intention of hurting me. That isn’t right. I just want you to be happy in a healthy way for both of us.

Something harder to talk about is the meltdowns you’ve been having, where you break down and try to break up with me until I calm you down. I think they’ve been happening an average of every 2-3 weeks since we moved in together. I’m your rock, but these are starting to get hard even for this rock to bear. I feel a little closer to breaking every time a new one comes up. I cried after the last big one because it seemed like we were actually going to go through with it and it made me imagine my life without you. I don’t know how I can help. You tell me it’s because I don’t do this or I don’t do that and it all builds up, so I’ll write down things I can change. Short of doing things that I believe are enabling you, I take steps to change the best I can. That doesn’t seem to stop the meltdowns though. How do I help? If this relationship is too stressful and it’s hurting you more than helping you, I understand if you want to end it. I love you and I just want you to be happy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q95xnv/i_was_writing_a_letter_to_my_gf_as_the_last_make/

10,q968bj,1634364628,Where have the normal/good girls gone ?,"Ok, so I've been using dating apps for about 1.5 years now and I noticed that there seems to be very few ""normal"" women. There's many alt-girls, goth girls, alcoholics, and these wanna-be instagram models but ordinary yet good looking girls are uncommon. Throughout my time swiping I found around 3-5 such ""normal"" girls, with one of them I had a relationship for some time but whenever I find them they are always far away (200-300 km / 124-186 miles) , the last one I found was literally half a country away.  
Now this confuses me because I remember just a few years back in my early teens *(here I should note I have the ""honor"" of being a part of Gen Z)*  most girls were ""normal"". There were no alt girls, no goth girls, substance use was waaaaay lower and they even looked similar (style wise). And I don't know if this is just what happens when ppl age or was it sorta a social change around that time that resulted in girls changing so much. There's also now more girls with piercings and tattoos (which tbh look crap in my opinion).  
Also another thing that puzzles me is how when you find one of these ""normal"" girls they try to downplay their normality. They say things like ""my psyche is messed up"" and try to be edgy. Why are they doing it ? Do they feel like they need to seem ""cool"" or ""different"" ?  
Also as a side note, I do guess that a lot of girls who fall under the ""wanna-be instagram model"" category could actually be ""normal"" girls who just do things for instagram but it's not really easy to tell.  


So does anyone have thoughts on this. Honestly I can't tell if what I see is true or whether I'm being delusional and I just never noticed other types of girls because when I was younger my social circle was slimmer. **And if you know how to find such ""normal"" girls please share how.**  


Also a PSA

13,q96fh8,1634365603,Just looking for sex or actually a relationship guy?,"Met this guy at an alumni party. Went on ONE date. He invited me back to his place and we kissed and ended up hooking up (I said “maybe we should not do this” but I guess I kissed him back so cannot blame him. He did not verbally ask if we can have sex, but we were already making out...so he probably expects it. He tried to put his “private part” into me (without a fucking condom on). He put it in halfway before I push him away and tell him to stop. Then I asked him to get a condom and he said “let me see if I can find one” - why would you even try to hookup without a condom WITH A STRANGER.
He put it in, we tried to have sex but I was not in the mood anymore so we went to sleep. Cuddled for a bit and slept together. The thing is when I am half asleep, he rubbed his “private parts” on me again and tried to talk nasty to me. I AM NOT HAPPY that he tried it again, maybe he got the wrong idea because I cuddled him...but still, I was half asleep. I did not feel good about it.

In the morning, he cuddled with me, kissed me in the lips and cheek. Hung out with me. Invited me to meet his friends and family. This happened a while ago. He texts me everyday and asked me to be in a relationship with him. He hardly calls but started to call more now I mention I prefer verbal contact. I told him we can continue being together but not in a serious way but he insist that he want us to be exclusive. I also tried to cut him out of my life because everytime I think back to that night, I am annoyed. He always comes back no matter what I do (maybe for the sex but we are long distance until Christmas so not sure if it’s worth his effort to do all this just to have sex with me again). He also wants to invite me to his company party - he works for another office in another city. The second time we tried to sleep together I told him I am not ready and he said it’s fine and just hugged me. I just get a player vibe from him because he calls me “sexy” all the time.

I like the guy but he did not leave me a good impression first time. Overall he is respectful and gives me what I want. I push him away a lot because of what happened but he is still there most of the time.

What are your thoughts? Bad guy or just someone who was horny and made bad decisions that night?

I like my space, always have, online schooling crippled my social skills and all of my friends have been online since i was 14, im 24 now. Covid has not helped at all, i was planning to return to college before it happened, but covid ruined my chance to be young after working hard for years after online high school to go back and finally feel young with my peers, and i often wonder if i missed out on many things due to my upbringing growing up, and now with my adolescence leaving me, Most of my childhood is blank, video games, online school, or media. Locked in a closet as a kid for years sometimes, losing out on being with other kids growing up, with nothing but technology, it was fucking depressing. You see why so many kids today post-covid on online school are suffering? that's what I went through, and I suffer the social consequences. 

I've recovered to a healthy degree socially, i have been living on my own, doing my own thing, working and growing, saving money for schooling, but ive never been in love. I cannot tolerate intimacy because it makes me cringe. Touch is terrifying, and i am afraid something is broken inside of me.

Just a few things to name a few. However deep down we truly care for each other. He’s the only other person who I’ve ever been vulnerable with and vise versa. 

We both have done a lot of ground work, dealing with our mental health with therapy. And so on. However my drinking gives me too much courage and i find myself calling him an excessive amount of times. Merely because I miss him. He states he understands and he’s not upset about it. However a lot of his childhood past trauma was him growing up with alcoholism throughout his family and it just makes him uncomfortable.

I really only started drinking to cope with my first heartbreak. Got my shit together. Now I simply drink because I’m out having a good time and out for long periods with friends. And more often than not I’m living in the moment so I don’t call him as much. Just when I do, I wholeheartedly just want to spend time in his arms and maybe do a thing or two lol. 

But I’ve come a long way with my drinking. There was a point where I was drinking HEAVILY 6 days a week. Now it’s impressive if I’m out 2 a month.

21,q96p5d,1634366876,I'm Done with Dating...Officially done..," Just like so many other things in life that eventually come to an end, dating can be added to that list for me.

 I turned 50 last December to me 50 is old, very old but I do realize that a lot of people do not think 50 is old.  I was surprised that there are a lot of younger people that are actually into older people it's something that's been on an upward trend for a while..

  Yes I do realize these people have daddy issues or some are into older for financial reasons but I have found a few younger guys that are not in it for the money, as far as whether they have Daddy Issues hey listen I'm not living in their head I can't tell you what's going on there..

 I've decided to throw in the towel for multiple reasons and you would think the biggest reasons would be my health. My health sucks  no way around it, I have a lot of health problems and they're not getting better. 

 My health started fading officially 13 years ago and it's just been downhill since.  For a long while I was actually just unable to date ---constantly being in the hospital getting treatments having surgeries-- dating was impossible.. as I was recovering I started putting myself out there and in the beginning I enjoyed dating.  I had a good time but nothing ever seemed to clicked with anyone.. a lot of the issues that I blame it right on the fact I was getting older I was in my 40s my health was a slow decline always something cropping up problem after problem but I still was determined to try to get out there and meet new people and have fun..

 Now being gay this community stinks you would think he would be a little bit more tolerable and kind if you're over 30 and you're single and you're gay you might as well give up..  I wish I did,  I wish I did a long time ago give up that is.. But no I had to keep trying..

   as the years went on I became more toxic, jaded and bitter.. not because of my health but because of the people I was dating. one jerk after another and now I'm one of the jerks and I don't want to be.. I've decided I don't want to feel the way that I feel anymore.. I feel terrible not health-wise, yeah I feel lousy there too but do you know what's worse is how I feel after going on a date or trying to meet somebody or me needing to turn someone down or someone rejecting me, which if I'm honest is everyone that's all I face.. I just can't do it anymore it's way too much of an emotional roller coaster and it's one I want to get off,  I don't want to be on this ride anymore.. 

   yes,  I'm lonely I'm extremely lonely and that's the whole allure to wanting to be in a relationship. I've been seeking the dream for so long to have a significant other that cares about me and that I care about, someone to do things with someone to keep my spirits up and I can keep their spirits up,  just the opposite keeps happening so far..  I'm never going to find it so why put myself through the misery any longer.. 

 I'm just not going to do it anymore. I finally need to put an end to this and it's way overdue. Some people may be wondering how are you going to handle interaction with people when you are in the mood for sex.. simply I'm not and that can be done.   I started a medication that will kill your sex drive it was specifically designed to do that as long as you take this medication you don't even think about sex you don't want sex you don't want any of that.. I started it last week it kicked in and boy you immediately start thinking differently when you no longer have any Drive.. and as any gay will tell you (any honest gay) will tell you your sex drive really controls a lot of what you do.. From going out on various apps and hooking up and doing things it really takes over it controls a lot of what you do in your life and once you eliminate that do you get your life back or you get (a life back..) 

 I look back at the things I did the relationships I've had the arguments have gotten into it was all so stupid.. this is all new to me but I can already tell that it's going to be a pretty lonely existence.. now that I don't have to deal with my sexual urges while trying to make friends I guess I'll find out if I'm someone people want to be friends with. I suspect its going to be a pretty lonely existence..  But would I rather be alone or would I rather spend the rest of my life getting turned down rejected made fun of be the butt of the joke or even get taken advantage of for whatever reasons... NO I don't want any of that anymore. I don't want to be that person anymore I'll take being alone.. sometimes you just need to know when it's time to throw in the towel.. I didn't know that I should have thrown it in 15 years ago... 

so far all you that are in your twenties and thirties and single enjoy it!  try to settle down for those that did  congratulations.. for those that got married or in committed relationships don't take them for granted.. you don't want to be apathetic old guy grasping at straws trying to find someone before they check out..

  The last few years I feel like something is unsettled, I was missing out on.   I never got it, now I know I never will.  I took care of it I wanted to stop that yearning to be wanted.

24,q975oh,1634369103,Constantly lacking a romantic connection,"Hey everyone,

I'm dating with the purpose of finding a relationship. In the last year I've been on dates with 

First guy I went on 2 dates with (we slept together on the second date). After I went home, he told me he wasn't feeling a connection. He wanted to be friends, so I agreed. We ended up sleeping together again on multiple occasions of course, this went on for about 2.5 months until I stopped seeing him. He said I ticked all of his boxes and we got along great, but he wasn't feeling that spark.

The second guy I went on 6 dates with, we never even kissed that entire time. Yet when I asked him out on dates he would agree to go. That fizzled out when he did a slow fade and eventually ghosted me. I cut my losses quickly.

Went on first dates with 2 different guys (#3 and #4) I ended things straight after as I wasn't feeling any interest towards them whatsoever.

The 5th guy I went on 6 dates with. Slept together on the third date, things seemed to be going well. A few days after our 6th date, he told me he didn't see it turning into anything serious as there wasn't a strong connection there for him. He wanted to keep seeing me casually, I told him I couldn't see him anymore.

The 6th guy I went on 2 dates with. At the end of the second date I had a feeling he wasn't as into it anymore, but I decided to ask him on a third date anyway the following week. He let me know he wasn't feeling a romantic connection.

I don't really know what I'm doing or not doing that results in a lack of romantic connection with guys. They all tell me they find me really attractive, they like me, they enjoy spending time with me. But that romantic connection is always missing. Doesn't seem to matter if I sleep with them or not.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to improve the likelihood of developing a romantic connection with someone? I feel like I've lost 2 really great guys because of this.

P.S. When I've posted previously, a few common questions come up, so I'll answer them now.

* I've been told I'm an attractive person by men and women. I believe I am, too.
* I'm slim, petite, slight curves. I've been told I have a great body and I believe I do, too.
* I dress very feminine and to suit my body shape, and enhance my curves. I always make sure my makeup and hair look great for dates.
* I can hold a conversation and typically focus more on the other person. Asking questions, showing an interest in what they have to say. I talk about myself too of course, but I definitely make it more about them.
* I have a lot to offer a partner and I believe I showcase that, myself, and my personality.
* I'm an introvert, and I come across as confident but not cocky. Like everyone, I have insecurities but I don't let them show.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Every guy I date says they lack a romantic connection with me. How can I fix this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q975oh/constantly_lacking_a_romantic_connection/

I would text I’m not in the mood but I feel awkward to say it out loud. I don’t want to ruin his mood too. I know I’m wrong for not saying it out loud and clearly. But what I want to know is he’d continue doing it and would dirty talk more when I say I’m not in the mood. Is this normal? I don’t think it is. I don’t know how to tell him not to do anymore.

This was only one example. I get a lot of attention from people wherever I go, I’ve been told that I’m handsome and good looking by those around me.

 	2. We don't have enough things in common. We like different music\\series\\movies\\food\\books\\...  
 	We also have different taste in things.

 	I am an engineer, I like to read books, learn things, I always look for ways to improve my life and have a better future.  
 	and she spends most of her time with friends, or watching TV, or just spending time doing nothing at home.  
 	4. Sometimes I feel she is needy  
 

**The reasons why I think I should keep the relationship:**  
 	1. She is really a very good person with a good heart  
2. She cares about me, and loves me too much  
 	3. I feel she is very loyal to me

And I have never been in a real relationship nor had any sort of sexual or suggestive encounters, I used to be very shy but not as much now but I still have great social anxiety and I fear rejection, I believe this is because I am mostly scared that I'll never find anyone not just because I may be seen as a late bloomer but also because I was born in Northern Europe but I grew up in Australia and I was bullied in school for being perhaps the palest person in the school.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have Albinism however I feel I will never find anyone because I feel 99% of people in my area just don't like how pale I am, I've become that scared that I've considered going in the sun daily without protection to darken my skin (even though I already go in the sun regularly, (I don't tan I burn)

My question is, is this normal to be considered unattractive because of how pale I am and if so what can I do about it? I don't want the game to be much harder for me just because of the way I was born, It gives me heartbreak and anxiety. Are there more people than I think out there that aren't judgemental/picky about this? Am I paranoid?

So I decided to make simple mobile app that I hope can help such people. It's free, has no ads and don't use internet connection.  
Let me explain the idea of the app.  
Say, you met a stranger in the subway, cafe, bus, club... and you like her/him?  
And if you don't have enough courage to speak with a stranger, but brave enough to show mobile phone screen, here you go.

1. Just type your name and write an interesting dating offer.
2. Then show the screen with your offer to the person you like. That\`s all!
3. The person you show the screen can type phone number or social media account name, so you can continue your conversation and go out for a date.

If you like to try it, you can search it in App Store or Google Play by ""Small Talk Pickup"".  
Also, there is PWA version, but I can't post url here due to rules of Reddit.

I asked him if everything was alright, and he said he’s not feeling in the mood for his life, but that we’re still okay and that I still make him happy. Come Thursday, I tell him I miss him and he says he misses me too. I get a good night text on Thursday, and then Friday is absolutely nothing. I text him asking if I did something, and got no response, but he viewed my Instagram story. I tried texting and calling, and again, no response. He is not one to just ghost someone and we’ve talked through “arguments” in the past, but this time feels different because I’m not even sure what I did to get ignored like this. I’ve been very hurt and anxious and unsure what to do now. Do I attempt to contact him again, or do I just let it run its course and if it hurts me, so be it",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q9b9tv/guy_ive_been_talking_to_for_months_ignored_me_for/
54,q9ba18,1634388260,Girl says she wants to date then gives excuses,"She recently told me she liked me. I don't know her well and I think she is still trying to see what she says that will be good and what doesn't. So far its been a difficult conversation because she shuts down quickly and doesn't ever get around to talking about the things we want to talk about. Recently, this has become problematic because she is saying a relationship sounds like something she wants and she wouldn't mind dating, but we haven't spoken since we met each other and the idea of getting together has grown more distant as we have talked. I can tell she is taking this serious, and thats good. She is just incredibly lazy, and where she does show up it is great. I wish she covered more distance and was able to send more than one text every few days. 

Right now I do not think anything is going to happen between us. She is still very tense and our conversations fall flat every time we talk. This isn't good and doesn't allow for us to talk about things how I prefer.

Any ideas on how I can talk to her about this or is it a lost cause?

56,q9bi9s,1634389135,"I'm 5'10, I love tall women.","At first, it is a simple statement that normally no one bats an eye. However, once I discuss why I have this preference, many taller women run to the hills. To be put it bluntly, I have a height kink specifically Macrophilia (the attraction to large things, in this case tall women). There is more to said kink, but for this post I will keep it simple here. In short, it is hard for me to date taller women because many of them revile that kink.

Honestly, I can not blame them. Especially those who have dealt with too many height chasers that only want to fulfill their fantasies while completely disregarding the woman's feelings. This stigma of the chaser with no boundaries hangs over me because of this. I like to openly express what I am into, but I will do it with someone who is comfortable with it. It is about being respectful and having common courtesy for those who are into it and those who are not.

If there is anything you should take away from this post it would be this, regardless of what you are into, always be respectful of one's boundaries. It goes without saying, but sadly some people tend to disregard that rule of dating just for their own pleasure.

He has stopped doing it so much around me but during the work week - it's everyday.  Sometimes those late phone calls are drunken rambling with his buddies over speakerphone.   I hate it.  For one, I have waited all day to hear from him and I would love to speak to HIM. I would like the version of himself that's sober.

76,q9d5z8,1634394775,Feels like I may as well be in a long distance relationship,"I started talking to this girl back in April. It started online and we're both in our 20s. Obviously, with the pandemic, it took us a while to actually meet up. We waited until it was safe, we were both fully vaccinated, etc. We talked on a daily basis and it was seemingly all good. We seem to gel pretty well and have all the same interests and all of that.

One thing that always kind of stood out when we talked; 90% of the time, when I brought up meeting up or something we could do when we finally could do so, she'd kind of ignore that message and talk about something else.  I figured, maybe she wasn't cool with it yet, not interested, or whatever. At that point, we'd only texted, talked on the phone, etc. Occasionally, SHE would come up with an idea like ""let's go skating when winter comes along"". It was a weird thing where she'd only acknowledge doing something together if she brought it up first. 

Anyway. Fast forward a couple of months. It's safe to meet up and we finally do so. We had a nice date. All is good. Our next date? Two weeks later. The next date after that? Another two weeks later. 

I'm really enjoying the time we do spend together. However, she works a fairly demanding job where she works over 55 hours a week sometimes. Some weeks, she has to work on Saturday. 

We literally live around 15 minutes away from each other and I spend as much time with her as I did with an ex-gf that I lived an hour and a half away from. 

She gets busy and tired because of work and I entirely understand that. But here's a kicker; even when she has a weekend off and knows she may have to work the next weekend, she'll tell me she needs a day or two off to just stay home and be lazy (in her own words). Which means, she's too ""lazy"" to hang out this weekend but she probably won't be available the weekend after either. It's kind of driving me nuts. 

So since first talking to her back in April... we've hung out four times total. I'm all for giving this some more time but this schedule of hers is making it impossible to actually plan anything ahead of time. 

I don't know if much advice could be given or not. I mostly posted this to vent a bit. But any would be appreciated. Thanks",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q9d5z8/feels_like_i_may_as_well_be_in_a_long_distance/

Then suddenly he starts crying. I ask him what’s wrong, and he said “I’m still in love with someone else, my ex. I would die for her.” 

Then I decide to go to bed and he leaves. I tell him how confused I am and how I don’t understand that the first time we finally kiss and I open up, he says that. 

He did speak about her before every now and then about how she was borderline and suicidal. I also talked about my ex but when I asked forever ago if he still has feelings he said no. 

The next week, I tell him we probably wouldn’t work now after that because I don’t want to be a second option. He proceeds to say “I don’t love her anymore. I only think I do when I’m drunk sometimes. It’s rare that I feel that emotional drunk, it’s cause you were in my arms and the thought of falling for someone else, etc.”

I feel incredibly hurt right now. I really don’t think I can trust again. It’s always when I finally open up I’m not enough or I’m a placeholder. 

What are your thoughts? Am I right here?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q9eohw/we_became_very_close_he_began_falling_for_me_and/
94,q9epnt,1634399747,How do I become unobsessed with my partner?,"I would like to preface this by saying this is my first post… My boyfriend (17 m) and I (17 f) see each other for hours on end daily, until one of us has work. While I couldn’t see the issue with this at first, I have come to realize how harmful it has been. I am obsessed with him and he is my main source of happiness. We both struggle with depression and while we both need each other, I can tell I need him quite a bit more. I am stuck and lost because the thought of taking a personal day or going to spend time with a family member for a weekend makes me so sick both emotionally and physically (i get very nauseous from anxiety). I want to get out of this doom cycle but I don’t even know where to start. I am thinking of bringing this up to my therapist soon, but until then do I just sit in my misery? An example of how bad it’s getting is that his phone died because he didn’t charge it at night and I started bawling my eyes out at the possibility that he blocked me. It scares me how emotionally upset I get over small things like this because I instantly think the worse since I am so scared of losing him. I need any advice or help I can get.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q9epnt/how_do_i_become_unobsessed_with_my_partner/
95,q9f19c,1634400735,youngster with a question,"i need help guys

So i’m a high schooler. freshman year. i’ve been talkin to this girl for about 3-4 weeks at school and over text. i’ve liked her for abt 2 weeks. she’s not super attractive or anything she just makes me feel good abt myself when i’m around her. She sends me soooo many mixed signals. for example last week it was cold and she asked for a hoodie. i didn’t have one on me. next day it’s no where near as cold like high 80s and she took the hoodie i had out of my backpack when i went to the bathroom. she kept it for 2 days then gave it back. another example is when we were talkin abt the homecoming dance she said she wasn’t planning on going with anyone but wanted to ask this boy out. after a bit of talking she said the kids name but said he doesn’t go to our school and she hasn’t talked to him for a while. so at that point i kinda gave up and jus said she should ask him out. she then said she never said she wanted to go with him. There are more examples i just don’t feel like re thinking abt them cuz it sucks. so anyways last night i asked her to the dance. she said she wanted to go as friends if she was allowed to go. i then said ok we’ll see and that i’m not even trying to do anything crazy with this jus go and have fun. i’m not the most attractive guy at school but i’m 6ft 150 lbs have a man bun ( she’s expressed that she loves the man bun) and am in better physical shape and looks then anyone in my grade ( honestly. i’m at a nerd school you have to apply to get in)

am i fucked. should i do some sort of technique on her or should i just move on and talk to one of the many other girls at school. ?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q9f19c/youngster_with_a_question/
