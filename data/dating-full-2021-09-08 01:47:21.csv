This was more than I expected because they're both Christian and somewhat conservative. Anyway, we hadn't talked about it a lot, but during the time, I'd developed a quite nebulous and undefined romantic relationship with a guy. Despite becoming pretty fond of him, I'd always been hesitant to go further with him because of our pretty significant personality and cultural differences.

I'm African American, from the East Coast of the US, and have grown up in an extremely diverse community of people that has afforded me a lot of opportunities to develop cultural competencies throughout the years. He is white, from the Midwest, comes from a very conservative Catholic family, and hasn't grown up having the same ability to experience and learn from others unlike himself.

Throughout our relationship, I've come to realize how many ways that we just don't connect because of the difference in our backgrounds. We have different senses of humor that don't always align; we process and deal with emotions in different; we see the world and people differently. Sometimes it doesn't bother me, but other times I'm left feeling kind of unfulfilled when we're together. And sometimes I feel really comfortable and able to be (one side of) myself when I'm around him. I think he knows this because as I was trying to explain why I feel unsure about pursuing a relationship, he noted that he thought that I felt unsatisfied with him because I ""have to code-switch"", which is true in a lot of ways.

Anyway, this past weekend, I was checking in with my parents about how they were processing my coming out to them a year later, to which they reaffirmed their support and even encouraged me to find a relationship. Something about that was very liberating because I never invested a lot of energy toward finding a relationship due to the fact that I didn't know how they'd feel about me being in a full-blown relationship with another guy. I think I'm finally ready to find that now, but I just don't know if it would be with this guy.

Most importantly, I don't like the fact that he has no plans on coming out to his family. I feel like I'd be wasting my time dating him because I'd never meet his family, and even if I did, then I might not ever be fully embraced. That bothers me a ton because family is extremely important to me. I've always imagined my SO becoming a part of the family and for our families to merge into one bigger family.

Are my concerns valid? Should I pressure him to come out? Should I walk away?

I've basically tried all the major ones during the past three months and have noticed certain things that have annoyed me.

One of the biggest annoyances that I've come across is when I get a match about 90% of the time the other person never responds. I'll get the match send them a message, not just a hey or hey what's up, but an actual message with some meat to it and I get nothing back. What I can't comprehend is why on earth these people are matching with me if they have no intention to even send a single message. I know people ghost all the time (which is awful btw) but I can't comprehend why people don't even send a single message. The entire point of online dating is to meet and talk to people so if you're not up to that then why are you using these apps?

The three apps I've used the most during the past 3 months are Hinge, Bumble, and Tinder. Been on Hinge and Bumble for 3 months and Tinder for about 2 months. I've had a varying amount of matches on all three.

In 2 months I've had 5 matches on Tinder which to my surprise is the most matches I've had with any of these apps. I would've thought that I'd be getting more matches on Hinge given that I'm looking for a long term relationship. Out of those 5, only one person actually sent me a message. Their reply came 3 days after my initial message and I responded to it a couple of hours later and then never got another response. I've also used Tinder Hot Takes (for those who don't know it's basically kind of like a blind date but just over text and then eventually you'll see the other persons profile) and even on Hot Takes so many people don't respond. Which to me is baffling since the whole point of the feature is to talk to someone to then see what they look like.

Hinge is by far my favorite app that I've used and I've had 3 matches in 3 months. The confusing part to me is that my first two matches came in my first month of using the app and then I had absolutely no matches for 8 weeks. I was still using the app during this time but wasn't getting any matches. Like I said before this was confusing to me as I can't comprehend how I'm liking hundreds of profiles over those 8 weeks and not a single person reciprocated interest. Anyways my first match actually led to a short conversation. Conversation was going well until the other person just stopped responding. My second and third match never responded to the initial message. What I don't understand about Hinge is this app is supposed to be for those looking for a serious relationship yet some people don't even send a single message. Also, another thing I don't understand is that for all of my likes I send a comment along with the like which is meant to be a conversation starter for if we match. All 3 of my matches didn't respond to the comment instead they ""invited to start the chat"". Like I said the whole point of the comment is to start the conversation but then they just ignore it and wait for you to initiate the chat.

Lastly is Bumble, which is an app I don't understand whatsoever. It was the first one I downloaded as a close friend recommended me trying that one first. I've been on the app for 3 months and haven't had a single match. Not one match. Nothing. I really can't comprehend how that is even possible when I'm getting matches on Tinder and Hinge. For the first month, I spent the most time on Bumble. Honestly, too much time on the app and not a single person liked me back. I honestly wonder if the app is even working because like I said I can't if wrap my head around how that is even possible. My friend who recommended it to me met his gf after one month and they've been dating for almost 3 years and are planning on getting married. Yet, I've been on this app for 3 months and haven't even had a single match.

Anyways, I'm sorry this turned into such a long post but I really needed to vent because this is getting really frustrating. I'm not even annoyed at the lack of matches. I'm just annoyed that the ones I get don't even respond. I'm not someone who's looking to be inundated with matches. I'm honestly just looking to talk to someone, hopefully go on a date with them, and see where it goes from there. But it's nearly impossible to do any of that when the majority of my matches never send a single message.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,994926,public,self,My Experience With Online Dating Thus Far,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pk17up/my_experience_with_online_dating_thus_far/,all_ads,6,,,,

So I (23f) have been single now for 4 years. This is completely 100% by choice. I took 2 years to heal, one year to explore, and this last year to make big changes. With all of this being said, I am a huge hopeless romantic. I absolutely love the idea of flirting and just having fun all around. 

Sounds totally fine right? Well I have fallen into the fear path of love. First I would meet the cute online guys and talk to them for a few months then just dip. Why? Because I loved the feeling of new crushes but hated the ""maybe I can come see you?"". 

Slowly it then shifted into ""well maybe I could try some dates?"" Which only lead me to going out with these guys and having a wonderful time but always dipping after the first date. Why? Because I loved the beginning but hated the ""Wow, you are really cool. I really want to get to know you more"". 

Now I'm at the point where I realize that I'm genuinely not ready for a serious relationship because I haven't found someone I can trust. I always said I don't want serious but I also refuse to have a fwb. 

So yes. I totally lead guys on but it's not because I don't care about their feelings. I'm just really scared that I will have to commit and then lose my freedom. I'm trying really hard to stop looking at everything as a lockbox commitment. The second I feel obligated to hang out with them more than I actually want to, then I totally shut all emotions off. Yeah yeah trauma or something but please tell me I'm not alone in this? Any tips on feeling more in control in the beginning of a relationship and not leaving at the ""I want to hang out with you more"".

He never made any physical advances until he eventually asked after hanging out about 5-6 times. Not even like rubbing my foot if I pushed it up to him during a movie.

I also exclusively use hinge  which makes implementing this advice a lot easier, but I'm sure it would still be useful on other apps. Anyway, here we go-

* **Show what your personality brings to the table** 
   * If you were to ask your friends and family what one thing they consider to be the biggest defining aspect of  your personality, what would they say? That you're high energy, cool under pressure, animated, goofy, serious, thoughtful, outgoing, shy, very organized, etc? Whatever you think they would say, someone looking at your profile should be able to tell that about you based on your pictures, how you answer prompts, or ideally both. 
* **State your values**
   * What is most important to you, that you strive to live up to, that drives most of the decisions you make? Is it that you always put your family first? That you always want to be able to take pride in doing a good job? Do you constantly push yourself professionally? Are you here for a good time, or a long time? What specifically makes you a good person? You don't need to convey all of your values, but someone reading your profile should know something about *how you live your life* and *what values drive you to live that way*. 
* **If you can show it, don't tell it!**
   * Hobbies, work, cool vacation stories, favorite sports teams, etc. are all fantastic to put on your profile, but your space to write text is often super limited. Use that limited space to talk about things that cannot be easily shown in a picture or video, such as your values or parts of your personality that are hard to show. If you don't have pictures of your hobbies and adventures, get them! If it's a hobby or activity that doesn't show well in a picture or video, you need to get creative and find a way to show it and not just tell it. (looking at all my fellow video gamers out there- Throw an esports viewing party and take pics, or record your reaction to something crazy happening in a game, the sky's the limit- put yourself out there, and show your personality while you do your thing!)
* **It's not about standing out, it's about standing out** ***to the right people***
   * A common thing I see on this sub is how to stand out against everyone else, particularly for guys as women often get overwhelmed with matches. If you are looking for something more serious, the question isn't about standing out against others in general, its about how to stand out to the kind of person you're compatible with- and there is no better way of doing that than conveying your personality and values through your profile. Of all the couples I know that met through OLD, both partners usually something along the lines of ""They said \_\_\_\_ in their profile and that really resonated with me and showed that they were really \_\_\_\_ , which is something I look for in a partner."" Don't prioritize putting things on your profile that appeal to most people- put things on there that will *really strongly appeal to the right people.* That's how you stand out and really hook the interest of a good potential match.  

Bringing a profile up to this standard takes a lot of effort, careful consideration, and self reflection, not to mention time- it'll probably take several days of thinking and revising at a minimum- you need to seriously commit to digging deep, reflecting on who you are, and then figuring out how to effectively show that to others in the limited space you have, so that ***at a glance they get an idea of who you are as a person- not just what you do or what your interests are.*** For me, the results were very much worth it. After bringing my profile in line with this advice, my number of matches stayed about the same, but the quality of my matches drastically, *drastically* improved, way more of my matches resulted in actual dates, and those dates on average went far better than they had gone prior to my profile revamp.

We're all out there looking for a meaningful human connection- so show the world what is meaningful to you as a human! Spruce up that profile so that you're more than just a swipe in a sea of matches- you'll only be seen as a unique individual as much as you show yourself as a unique individual!",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,994990,public,self,How to combat dehumanization on your online dating profile,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pk32fa/how_to_combat_dehumanization_on_your_online/,all_ads,6,,,,

Before many of you tell me im friendzoned for good, i must say she dated different kind of guys (tall, short, fat, skinny) and im not so ugly that would make anything impossible to happen. Im positive my physical appearance is okay. 

I do have a crush on her but i dont say much cause i dont wanna scare her away from me. She considers me a real friend for her personal problems. 

I wanna conquer her in small steps, making her feel comfortable around me and letting her know im not going to scree thing up like her ex boyfriends. Due to covid is tough to ask her to hang out in person. 

She is an intense person while im much more calm so her life is full of stuff happening and im not even sure i will have the time to try something. 

I feel like i gotta gain her as an essential person in her life first. Pretty guys she obviously knows a lot and some of her ex are ugly tbh. Im opened to your suggestions of approaches.

We had a big fight 3 months ago because of his lack of attention to me. He literally will only text me once a week and that's it. He's a gamer and he's unemployed. I had a conversation about this issue, twice. But he stayed the same. He changed for a week then back to his old habit. 
No text. No call. No nothing. 

We have only been together for 4 months at that point. So I thought, I should break up with him now to not waste anymore of my time. So I sent him a text telling him that I wanna a break up. He kinda defensive at first. He then begged me not to leave him the next day. He promised to change and will text me every single day, so I trust him and give him another chance. Suprisingly, he did text me everyday (or everytime i didn't text him that day) until today, it has been 3 months since our big fight.

I know I should be happy about this. I am. But, he only text me at night and he did not respond immediately to my texts, we text for few hours (with very little conversation). He never calls (unless I asked him to). But whenever we're on the phone, he sounds really happy and will not let me hang up the phone until I fell asleep (because I'm working during the day).

He did say he loves me once in awhile. We're not the romantic couple. We call each other by name. No darling, babe, honey, etc. I did call him baby once on the phone, and he make sounds and said ""bruhh"". Never did I call him baby anymore since then.

My question is; Does he or does he not love me as he claims to be? Should I continue this relationship? 

Idk if this relevant to this question but all of his friends knows about me and he proudly introduce me to his friends. We usually on call while his gaming with his friends. So it is safe to say that he's not cheating and he is proud to have me as his girlfriend. The only thing is the way he treats me.

Anyways, I met this girl off a dating app, chatted for a bit, swapped numbers and took her out twice so far in the past month. I'm assuming things are going well since the texting back and forth is still consistent and the dates both ended with us feeling like time passed by too fast. The chemistry is good between us and we both have similar personalities (infp and infj) plus she agreed to a third date afterwards.

With that said, I am a bit confused about pacing. I tend to be a bit more serious when I do date and prefer to really get to know someone before things get too involved. If I could I would flat out skip the small talk and ask the deeper questions but obviously don't because I don't want to come off too strong. Plus I do have other matches on the app and not sure if it's fine to see those other girls at the same time.

Since it has only been a month with her, when is a good time to get deeper and more personal, is it ok to talk with and see other girls, when does exclusivity happen, does making things physical speed it up.

Here is an excerpt from an article that I've found relating to this lawsuit:

*Certain Bumble app users are eligible to benefit from a $3 million settlement resolving claims of discrimination in Bumble messaging.*

*The Class is made up of Bumble app users in California who used the app between May 29, 2016, and July 1, 2021, and identified as a man interested in women.*

*A class action lawsuit had accused Bumble of discriminating against male app users who identified as being interested in women because the Bumble app only allows women to send messages first.*

*The Bumble dating app grew to* ***100 million users*** *in 2020, according to Business of Apps.*

*Bumble denies any allegations of wrongdoing, and the Court has not ruled in favor of either party.*

*Instead, the parties have agreed to a settlement resolving the issue in order to avoid the cost and burden of moving forward with litigation.*

*If the Court grants final approval in the settlement, each Class Member who had an active Bumble app account on the notice date and does not ask to be excluded from the settlement will receive a one-time deposit of 20 free Super Swipes — a total benefit value of $31.98 —  in their Bumble app account.*",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,995152,public,self,"Incel sues Bumble for ""discrimination"" against men.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pk5fe2/incel_sues_bumble_for_discrimination_against_men/,all_ads,6,,,,

He lived quite close and has the same University background as me so we hit it off quite soon. We ended up meeting the same week in a garden nearby and had a walk where we discussed about life and career. Overall I loved the vibe and I was more than happy to be his friend if he didn't want to date. 

After the first meet ,we had a good convo over text where he expressed his desire to meet more often for such walks as we lived too close. I willingly agreed. Then a day after the first meet , he asked to meet again in the evening. We even decided that we would confirm the plan in the evening. After that he went offline and I pinged him in the evening to ask the status about the plan but he didn't reply. I felt he must be asleep and evening naps aren't that uncommon in my friend circle so I didn't think much of it. I got a reply from him at night about how he had slept and he was sorry and we could try meeting tomorrow and I was like we will see. 

Next day he again asks to meet and I told him that in case he is going to take a nap just inform me prior to that. He says fine and then when it's almost time to meet in the evening I recieve a text from him that he got a meeting related to university work and I tell him to get his work done and we can meet some other time in the most understanding way possible. He says he will manage something and abruptly goes offline and comes back online after 1 hour and says can we meet now. I was already out at this point and was a little pissed too cause I have told him that I can only take out certain time out of my schedule and I was ok if he was not able to make it but his delayed response in conveying that sucked. Had he told me he would come late I would have called some other friend for a walk( it is nice to have company sometimes). 

After this I resolved that I won't meet him and will just text( cause we have some real nice convos at times). But a few days later he shares some problem he was facing and we had a very late night convo regarding the same and I assured him that it would be alright. He suddenly asks if I would like to meet him the next day and I say that I am not sure if he would turn up. He said he was sorry about the last time and I can trust him. After legit asking him a 100 times if he would turn up I get a little assured and we make a plan. We are supposed to meet at 4. And I get a text at 3:55 that he will be there in 15 mins. 

I feel all is well and I go and wait for him at the meeting spot. Suddenly he pings me that he has some work regarding the problem he faced yesterday. I ask if he can still turn up or no. He says he is coming, so I wait for a while but no sign of him. He is not coming online either. He doesn't pick up my call either. Finally he does after 10 mins and says he got stuck and he is coming. I feel like a fool for trusting him but I was actually out of home at this point vand didn't want to go back cause I live with parents and they are strict and they would not approve of tinder dates so explaining them why I returned so quick would have been impossible. Hence, I am stuck outside waiting for a guy and he finally shows up at 4:40. 

I am in rage and he apologises. Going back is not an option, so I do go out with him for 2 hours and we roam around and have a good banter. My mood is back to normal. We part on good terms. But I make up my mind to not meet him again. Also he went out of the city for a week after that and is yet to return. 

But he has started asking me to meet me this weekend once he is back. But I told him honestly that I don't trust him enough. He keeps on saying he is really sorry and it was the circumstances and all. But I am not sure so I have made up my mind to not meet. But the vibe with this person was too good. And he does text with me often. 

He says he likes me. He really wants to meet me. But his actions have proved otherwise. Is that possible that he couldn't show 3 times due to some genuine circumstances or was he not interested in the first place? Right now he is begging me to meet again. But I am firm I don't want to.

But I feel like I'm holding on a thread here. 

**Tl;dr: How do I fix my mindset when I know logically that I should be patient with my girlfriend because she’s temporarily very busy with her career, but I struggle to do so?**

Here’s the story:

We used to call 20 minutes a day, or even longer at times. Now we've reached a point where we don't talk for days on end aside from the texts/voice messages we send when we're both awake. I'm trying to understand that she just resumed classes in law school and she may be really busy. But I struggle to reconcile with the idea that she could be so busy she can't make time to talk to me anymore. I mean, is that even possible?

I've talked to her about scheduling regular talks, but she just seems aloof all the time. Her original suggestion was to call while she walks to school, to which I said that while I would prefer another time because I want to sleep early, I'd be down for it if there was no better choice. She said she could call while preparing for classes. I agreed. But every day since, she's cancelled. I confronted her about this and she said she just can't make time happen. I don't think she even apologized for flaking. She said she's usually freer to make time around one hour before I wake up, but she wouldn't ask that of me. I told her that by all means she could if that was the only choice. She said she'll figure out a schedule and will try to call on the weekend. She hasn't. 

I'm trying REALLY hard to be patient, but if two people in a relationship can neither see nor talk to each other, I feel like the relationship doesn't exist anymore. She's the first woman I've ever actually loved and I really wanna make this work, but sometimes I can't help my brain thinking I'm the only one who's trying. I know logically that's far from the truth, but my emotions get the better of me sometimes. 

To add to that, she's previously asked me to send her a voice message greeting her good morning everytime I wake up. I had initially resisted the idea because there are days when I'm just not in the mood. Despite that, she made it known how important it is to her, so I eventually agreed. These days, it feels like a third of the few conversations we're having is just me saying good morning, her replying, and us going back and forth a little. 

I hate what I've become. I try to avoid having more talks about having more time for each other. Because even though I frame the conversations as having more time for ""each other"", silently, I know it's just me asking for more of her time when she already has most she needs of mine. Mostly, when we talk about time, I feel like I'm just begging. 

The other day, she called me out of nowhere to my pleasant surprise, but when I got to saying, ""I've missed you, there's so much I want to share!"" She said, ""I have 30 minutes."" Instantly, I felt like I'm talking to a countdown timer who just goes, ""Hmm… yeah? Uh-huh."" So I tried to shift the conversation towards her by asking, ""How about you, how've you been doing, baby?"" I was expecting more details about her life and she just basically  said she's tired and very busy. She said she needed to sleep after just ten minutes, instead of the intended 30. I playfully protested a little, to which she said, ""You know I didn't have to call you. Would you prefer I don't talk to you at all?""

When we started dating, I was very vocal about wanting an open relationship so I wouldn't have to adjust too much, but she's super into monogamy so I agreed to be monogamous. I think that through time she noticed how miserable I am about my inability to be with her physically, so she told me she would allow me to have sex with other women temporarily. I declined her offer because I knew she wasn't completely comfortable with it and the pandemic helped start me to be more comfortable with monogamy. Now I'm so tempted to ask again because of how absent she is. But I won't.

In terms of solutions, I know I just need to keep myself distracted. But then the more try to occupy myself the more I want to share with her. Now it's like we don't know what's going on in each other's lives anymore. 

I love this girl and I want to hold on, so I'm desperate for advice. I'm particularly looking for ones on how to fix my mindset, but any kind is welcome.

I've had some hook-ups and some ""dating"" here and there, but it never ended up going anywhere
(I know this might not be correct English, but I'm using the word ""dating"" meaning ""seeing someone"", ""going on dates"", ""not a relationship yet"")
Anyways. 
I want a relationship now. 
So I actively started going on a lot of dates (tinder and not)
Until I found a guy a liked. Let's call him C. 
C is 19 older than me. I've seen him four times now. I find him very attractive, and he seems like a very interesting person. 
Although I don't seem to understand whether he is interested in a relationship with me, or if he prefers keeping it sex-only. I see signals from him for both things, so yeah. Also there's a few things that don't convince me fully about him. 
Since there's all this uncertainty with C (I know that I could just ask him, but I somehow feel like it's too early to bring up the topic), and it's been now 2 weeks that we haven't seen eachother (it was a busy time for both), I decided to go on another date. 
Let's call this guy S. 
S is 28. And holy shit we really clicked (it was just yesterday night). I know it was only one date, but I can really see myself with this person. He has almost all of the things I was looking for in a person.
And right away I know this is going to be actual dating ending up in a relationship if things work out. I know that he doesn't want a FWB thing from me.
I did not tell S about C.

C asked me out. I said yes.
But now that I've met S I'm not really sure anymore.
I could just tell C that it's over, but what if I go on the second date with S and we realize that we don't like each other that much or whatever? 
C and I have something already. I feel really good with him and honestly don't want to just throw it in the bin.

So what do you guys think I should do? Should I be straight honest with both and tell them? How would you react if someone told you something like that?
Or should I keep it to myself to avoid pressuring them or potentially make things uncomfortable?
I mean, I feel like it's totally fine what I'm doing. I'm considering my options before taking a non reversible decision.
I care about both and don't want to be dishonest or hurt anyone's feelings

TL;DR
I'm seeing two guys at the same time and they don't know about eachother yet. The thing is I really want a relationship and feel like both would be options atm.

We met a few times she seems nice and cute, i was interested but never made a move since i didnt really get to know her because i may see her once every 2-3 weeks. One time we were playing cards and we were sitting next to each other so we were talking and making jokes and all of that, i even ""teased"" her in a funny way, it was good we were vibing (she also leaned onto me and grabbed my arm when i told her smth funny). We were vibing imo and it felt really good (i think from both sides). So in a few days i go tell my friend, you know what i like that girl and it would be nice if we can arrange a day out or smth, he says cool i would love to help. 

After 2 weeks he texts me that he is in a cafe with his girl and also her friend ( the girl i like) is coming. For some reason i lost confidence knowing that my friend's girlfriend might know that i am into her friend. I was thinking not to go but i did meet them, i avoided eye contact with her at first i didnt feel really good, but then i gained some confidence and we had a casual chat nothing more, after that we went to eat (all 4 of us together) at night it went well nothing much though between me and her, i didn't really have the chance to sit near her at night and talk. And now its been few days when thsi happened and i am getting vietnam flasbacks of what i did wrong or not. I dont know how to proceed and how to approach the situation.

If you want to be exclusive, communicate that to see if you are on the same page. If you are not, then you should not longer date them because you want different things. 

If you’re wondering if your date in a few days is still on, just say that. If it’s not you can do something else on that day.

There is no cheat code for people. Your concern with looking desperate is controlling you and you deserve to know where they stand so that you can do what’s best for you and opt out of a situation that may not be working for you. People can’t know your needs/wants without you telling them. At the end of the day, you only have yourself, so you need to make sure you are surrounded by people who make sense for you out of respect for yourself.

The last guy I talked to (let’s call him A) before the guy I recently met (let’s call him B) lied to me the entire time and I didn’t find out until after. it kinda really fucked me up. I’m a very open and understanding person, so as long as you’re honest with me it doesn’t matter what your past/ current situation is. If I like you then it’s worth it. there is no reason to lie to me so that’s really what got me. 

I decided to stay single for a few months up until recently when I moved and met a new guy. let me tell you this guy has treated me absolutely amazing, 1000x better than any guy in my life, ever. and I don’t say that lightly I mean actually ever. He’s extremely thoughtful, we get along so well, our personalities align very well, we are both more career/ success oriented, we are into the same hobbies, he’s very honest, &amp; overall he checked every single one of my boxes. except the emotional availability box, the most important one. there were no other red flags, and believe me I was loooooking for them. 

i’m very tired of wasting my time and getting hurt and I’m really ready for something more serious. I’ve known I’ve wanted this for a little bit too and I’m willing to wait for it to come, but I got really excited that this was that one. but they just got out of a long term relationship a couple months ago and don’t know what they are ready for. and trust me I completely understand. we talked about it last night after seeing each other for a little over a month. the worst part is even though he’s not ready he was so honest with me and put my feelings first before his selfish needs. he didn’t to waste my time and end up hurting me because I expressed that I was looking for something serious from the beginning. he differed from every guy in that past in that way. he actually cared. that is what is the worst. he even checked the closure box. 

I can’t decide if I still want him in my life but I know I’m really tired of investing in people and ending up with the short end of the stick being left high and dry after constant effort. Part of me thinks if I do start dating again, am I willing to subject my heart to all that pain. this guy still wants me in his life and he said yanno I check more boxes than any other girl but he just isn’t emotionally ready. He still wants to go on adventures and come over and fuck which I would really love. But if I spend time with him and invest in this, even if it only turns out as a friendship, am I going to miss the opportunity with someone who can give me a more guaranteed future. but also why would i subject myself to more hurt and pain to find something with someone that I have with this guy. I know I want something serious but he gives me everything I would want in that except the long term commitment. I’m worried though I’ll get too hung up or hopeful for something more and if it never comes I’ll get even more hurt. 

Maybe this is a lesson I need to learn or maybe it’s a waste of time. all I know is I’m so tired of getting my heart hurt.

My hobbies are: Reading, Vocal composing, online research &amp; travelling.

My strengths are: passionately curious, Straightforward, open-hearted, ambitious, well-mannered, empathic, caring, family-oriented, Shy, funny, friendly, respectful, self-esteemed, grateful.

  
Moreover, I'm a virtual assistant, able to business develop through, lead generation, build over lacs of phone contacts database, any data collection like email, mobile etc. from any website, 2d to 3d design, audio isolation and mixing &amp; so on.

My dreams: Exploration Geologist, Audio production with moral lyrics, make videography with traveling on an open places etc.

And also consider myself a decent-looking man. But appearance is not the key element about me, cause I can offer way more than that!

I believe every human being does mistakes, and so do I, so does everyone else. It's what makes us human and we have to learn from those mistakes.

I'm happy to get to know you and adjust to you, as do I welcome learning new things for you and from you, being an eager learner.

I have many dreams and wishes I would love to share with you, I see myself as very hardworking and dedicated to achieve what I want to.

I am invested into religion and have been for the past 10 years, but I don't traditionally follow it, but logically.

Now with being 27, I'm worried I'm running out of time, so I do hope to find a woman who fits to me and who thinks the same about me. I hope there might be someone on the corner of the world who could feel deeply for me. As I would for them.

My issue is that every means by which I attempt to meet women seems to have the same issue, significantly more men than women.

At some point I tried to look into this and what I found was confusing. The % ratio of men to women in the UK in my age range is supposedly almost 50/50, and yet online dating sites like tinder have 9:1 ratios, the better sites like hinge maybe 5:1 (I suspect much worse based on my experience).

Outside of online dating I run events in my local area to help people make friends, at these events similarly attendance is 90% male at best. I also do active activities in which similarly there are significantly more men or couples, at least in this case its not as bad as 9:1. To top this all off every friend group I have been involved in since I was a child has always been either 1) All men or 2) Mostly men and women who have very few female friends and never introduce them to us. When I go out drinking almost every bar seems to be majority men and generally younger people.

At this point I am baffled, I do not understand how this makes sense. How can it be that every social/active activity I choose to do has consistently significantly more men than women.

Meeting a single human female of average (or higher) attraction seems to happen once in a blue moon for me. Meeting a single human female of average (or higher) attraction who is actually my age and not a early 20s student is non-existent. My bar of attraction is not high.

It really just seems like if there really was 50% women in this country I would run into them more often, but as it stands it seems that they all just hide at home 99% of the time. It also seems that the ones you do see or meet are not dating, ever.

I have always thought that dance classes would end up being my last resort as far as dating goes because its one of the few activities where I am close to sure that there would be women, although now I am wondering if even thats true. Maybe I would book a class and end up slow dancing in a room full of men all there for the same reason. Is finding women centric things and joining them legitimately one of the few ways to meet people?

Im not a pickup artist and I hate flirting, I just want to meet people on equal ground and get to know them, hence why I run social events. Regardless I now have this image in my head that all the 28yo women in the UK just hide at home surrounded by cats and houseplants. The only way I can realistically see of meeting people regularly is to walk up to them in the street and talk but to me that seems predatory and I hate the idea of doing it. I am not a creep, I have never been called a creep by anyone, ever. I am (apparently) of average appearance or higher depending on who I ask, the people who have liked me have liked me a lot for whatever reason. Im not trying to brag, its just I know what kind of responses these posts get, this is not some weird aggressive creep post about how awful dating is, I am genuinely baffled by this entire situation.

She also mentioned other experiences of escalation of physical touch  that made her uncomfortable. So I decided to play it safe due to that information I heard which I now regret.
