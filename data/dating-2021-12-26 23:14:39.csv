0,rpfo5k,1640582535,I've never had a serious relationship and am worried I missed my shot,"I am 26 and recently went to a family friend's wedding. While there my older brother (28) had many girls come up to him, dance, or just chat. Now I was talking one girl that night too, but she ended up having a bf. I do lack some self-confidence and am not as good at flirting as my brother, it just seems effortless to him. My brother also started dating his first serious gf \~6 months ago, but was still entertaining these girls. 

Now you are probably thinking I'm just jealous of my brother, however I'm not, we are very different people and I'm very happy with myself and my place in life, except only in the dating realm. I am 6' 2'', skinny/average looking, content with my appearance, and I have a good job. I go out to bars and see girls, or in college I remember talking to girls at house parties, but very rarely did it turn into anything more. It just sucked after the wedding when family members and friends were commenting on the impression he left on all of these girls who were disappointed he was taken and none were interested in me. I know its my own issue and has more to do with my inexperience and lack of self-confidence than with my brother.

This is not the first time I've felt this way and I can think back on previous encounters with girls that I could've done differently, but that is in the past. At the same time I wonder if maybe I took a couple more chances or was a little more bold I could potentially have had one or two serious relationships by now. I just feel I've always been chasing the wrong girls and it almost makes me regret not settling for girls that I knew liked me but I wasn't interested in back. Have I been self-sabotaging myself my whole life just because I haven't tried hard enough, or didn't want to settle

Next week I am moving to FL (currently live in NJ) for my job where there is even less of a younger population than where I currently live, I'm worried I missed my chance and will not meet anyone (my anxiety talking). But I also think its a good opportunity to focus on myself. My plan is to hit the gym (The most comfortable I've felt going up to girls is when I'm consistently working out), stop smoking weed, find some new friends, hit up some bars, and actively practice having more self-confidence in these situations hoping it will eventually lead to a serious relationship. Any more advice on how to deal with these self-confidence issues would be great.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rpfo5k/ive_never_had_a_serious_relationship_and_am/
1,rpfokp,1640582572,Carrying a conversation,"Hey all, so I've been getting on dating apps.  Mainly hinge, bumble, tinder.  I'm a 22 male, and on the apps were a dime a dozen so matches are far and few between, however the other day I finally matched with this cute girl on bumble.   She seems really cool and we've had a family constant conversation

The only problem is we're only talking about her.  Ik all about her hobbies and passions, her work, etc. Not once has she asked anything about me! Not that I'm a narcissist and want to talk about my self all the time, but in the whole ""getting to know you"" phase shouldn't she actually get to know me?  

This isn't the first time eather.  I found that in alot of my matches I end up being the one asking questions and carrying the entire conversation, and non of the women put forth any effort to get to know me. Not Even simple things like my hobbies or work. Like WTF. Why can't women on these apps participate in the conversation.  Are they just to lazy and complacent to actually try to get to know someone.  Ik that is I stopped talking to this one girl, and we've only talked about her, that I wouldn't get another message from her, or from many of the girls I've stopped carrying the conversation with.  It's so frustrating that not even the smallest effort is made.  

PSA women, talk to guys.  Reach out to them, ask them what their passionate about.  How they are doing.  Their favorite memory. What their hobbies are. Don't just wait for the guy to ask you everything and have to carry the conversation. If you don't think this applies to you, look through your messages and see who texts who first.  Even then, make more of an effort to get to know the guy, cause I'm tired of keeping these conversations alive with complacent women who don't put effort into getting to really know someone till we buy you 4 dinners",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rpfokp/carrying_a_conversation/
2,rpfp0e,1640582613,Thoughts on dating an only child with divorced parents?,"Genuinely curious and not sure why I never asked this…I (29F) am an only child and my parents got divorced when I was 8. I have a great relationship with both parents but they don’t have much of a relationship with each other at all so always grew up with 2 Christmases, birthday parties, etc. I’ve found in my dating life that although I never ask about families beforehand I tend to date guys with big-ish families with married parents. I’ve never dated another guy who’s an only child as well. I have friends who are only children but they have married parents so I feel like I can never fully relate.

Curious though….honestly, what would most guys think of my situation? I feel like I’m pretty normal, work as an attorney, super independent, was in a sorority in college.

It started when she swiped up to a snap of me and we kicked it off from there. We talked for like a month before I asked her on a date. I picked her up we talked and everything went good. After, we kept talking and 1 week after everything stayed the same. We kept talking and even started hinting another date. Then 2 weeks after things took a turn in my life and things were tough. I wouldn’t reply to sc messages quick since I wasn’t in the right head space and didn’t really care if I lost her at the time. After, I think she was beginning to lose interest or give me a taste of my own medicine by also replying slow/ dry texting. Whatever the reason was I was going through a lot of personal things in my life and thought “this is the last thing I should be stressing about and so I left her on read after it took her 8 hours to reply. A week passed and I posted on snap, she saw it and I didn’t think much of it. A couple of days after I go on ig and I can’t see her account since I believe she restricted me. I got butthurt since she restricted me and so I blocked her on snap. I regret all of this and feel really bad. She was special and different from many girls that I’ve known. I didn’t know that I would be regretting this still a year later! Even more since I recently went through our old messages and believe there could’ve been something between us. I just want to make things right and apologize, maybe even try dating again since she still single according to her ig bio. What should I do?!? Should I try requesting to follow on ig and if she accepts message her? Should I message her through text (I still got her number)? Should I just move passed it? It’s been a year already.

I was really upset after that and really confused and I leave him an angry message , he IMMEDIATELY blocks me everywhere without any explanation. Also thought it was so strange how he immediately available to block me yet ignores all my other messages the entire day. I then get even more upset and proceed to use my second instagram account (since he blocked me on the other one) about what a piece of shit he is and even commented all over his posts about it so all the other woman can see what an arsehole he is and because I just don't give a shit no more. I just can't tolerate bullshit.

I’ve noticed any time a man in particular brings up his poor appearance, the cavalry comes screaming down on him, if not outright calling him an inc3l, hovering dangerously close to it and/or telling him he just “doesn’t try hard enough”, “has a shitty personality”, “doesn’t groom/clean himself” or any other manner of insult or accusation, as if his problem cannot in any way whatsoever be ascribed to his looks, it HAS to be something under his control, something he’s doing wrong. 


Why the aggression? Why is looks so taboo to discuss? People are happy to say looks matter somewhat, but then feel the need to immediately qualify that with overcompensating BUT PERSONALITY MATTERS MORE!!! So nobody calls them out for thinking “inc3l thoughts” 


I need some advice. Help me understand why this is the case.

But she initiate way less than what I am used to with other women my age, she isn’t best at bringing up new topic to talk about incase we would finish a topic.
Doesn’t ask me any questions, basically everything she knows about me I have brought up smoothly in conversation.

I feel like she likes me when we talk but then this low effort behaviour makes me think otherwise.

It’s frustrating and I am not sure if am to assume it’s her inexperience showing or if it’s just her interest isn’t high enough.. 

Really makes me appreciate how easy it is with more mature women.

Tl;dr 
I actually really enjoy talking to her but the inequality in effort is frustrating so here I am to rant/vent

I know this isn’t the typically post but I actually think it may fit here. 

I ask this with 100% curiosity and no other agendas. I recently learned about a described man shortage in Ukraine and the surrounding nations. I looked it up and apparently there are about 3.6 million more women than men, with Ukraine currently fatally under the birth rate required to sustain a stable population. I am interested to learn general information about this topic. Does this shortage affect dating characteristics in any way? Do women do more pursuing? What are some differences in the dynamics between men and women? Do the women still maintain most of the traditional values in a relationship?

We grew apart eventually, as we went to different colleges. He reached out to me about a year ago (after almost 10 years) to see how I was doing and told me that he deeply regrets not asking me out when we were younger. He asked to take me on a date. I was in a situationship at the time, so I turned him down. 

Me and the other guy broke up pretty soon after. My friend reached out to me again a couple weeks ago. Telling me how beautiful I am, and that he’s always liked me, and that he would like to take me on a date and that he hopes I’ll at least consider it because he’d treat me better… we’ve been taking back and forth since.

Reasons I’m hesitant:
1) We currently live in different cities and if we got into a relationship, someone would have to move eventually. I’m not good at LDR’s bc I need a lot of attention and quality time.. 
2) I’m not super attracted to him. Once a guy is my friend, it’s hard for me to feel that way towards him physically. He’s cute, but not my usual type.
3) I don’t know what his intentions are, or why he waited all these years to tell me. 

I know he would treat me well, and he makes me laugh. He was always such a kind and caring friend who I could tell anything to, and I keep dating douchebag after douchebag. I’m a little worried about how I’ll ever see him as more than a good friend though after that’s what he was for so long. And I’m worried about the long distance. I don’t want to hurt him, but part of me does want to see him and see where things go. I just can’t tell if it’s a good idea despite the circumstances.

57,rpkvl6,1640601888,Struggling with breakup for second time,"
Hi all, just need some advice and help, ex (20) broke up with me (22) mid November after 5 years together due to no longer feeling happy and excited.


So we separate and I started no contact for 3 weeks I was absolutely heart broken over it as I thought we were going to have a future together. After her breadcrumbing me she reached out just saying “I made the biggest mistake of my life thinking I wasn’t happy enough with you”.


I was obviously so happy when this happened and after talking we said we would take it slow and get back together. Yesterday after just 2 weeks trying she just kept saying her head was a mess and the last thing She want to do is mess with my head so I think we should just call it a day. 


This was all over text and I asked to see her in person just to talk and she wouldn’t and that was it she wouldn’t talk about it anymore or anything.


I just don’t know what to do now as when we first broke up I was struggling but made it 3 weeks with no contract and this time it is just so much worse as she literally said she made the biggest mistake of her life thinking she want happy with me ,so how can she say that then do this this 2 weeks later then my friends see her out clubbing a few hours later.


I just need advice on how to cope and deal with it, I’ve removed her off social media but the pain is so much worse the second time after her saying all that to me about making a mistake. I just don’t know how to cope she seems like a different person. She was hugging and kissing me just on Christmas Day saying she wishes she could spend all day with me too.


Any advice would be great!

58,rpl14x,1640602544,Help! How to have the commitment conversation when someone might be moving long-distance?,"I (33F) started seeing this guy (27M) about 2 months ago, met on Tinder and wasn't expecting much (after all, it's Tinder). I did indicate on my profile I was looking for something more serious, not just ONS. I thought maybe FWBs or maybe casual dating, who knows where that goes... 

However I've been pleasantly surprised. We get along very well, talk everyday and have hung out at least 1-2 times a week as our schedules permit. Communication feels very natural, our sexual chemistry is fantastic, and he's very sweet and chivalrous. I've tried to let him take the lead because a) keeping realistic expectations to avoid disappointment, b) trying to reciprocate based on his actions, not just his words. So far, he's been the one initiating conversations and arranging things in advance (i.e. next date plans on the current date, etc.) and his words and actions have been consistent.

My dilemma is this: He will likely be moving quite some distance away for work in the New Year, and I don't know where I stand or how to talk about what this means for us (more details below for context). I like him more than I thought I would, and I think there's a possibility that things could grow into something real if given the opportunity.

How should I ask him a) where we currently stand, and what (if anything) he wants from this relationship, and b) what his impending move means? (i.e. does he want to give a LDR a try, and if so what parameters are there? Do we set a time limit? How often and how would we see each other? Are we dating other people? etc.)

I don't want to rush the normal momentum of the exclusivity/commitment conversation and I really don't want to be that stereotypical clingy female who pushes things. But I'm feeling the need to have this discussion soon because there's a bit of a time limit with his potential move.

Any advice as to how/when to have this conversation? And what are people's thoughts about long-distance relationships when you've only just started seeing each other? 

I'm so confused! Please halp!

*For context:*
• We haven't had a conversation to define anything yet (no labels, no direct exclusivity discussion, etc.). I haven't wanted to be pushy or scare him away. However, his actions and the way we talk is very much bf/gf relationship stuff and I'm fairly certain he's not seeing anyone else. And he has made comments about plans in 4-5 months' time (I plan on having very serious surgery, he asked about sex 😅). 
• He's currently interstate with family for Christmas for about a month, which is making having any kind of conversation harder. I had hoped to find a moment for this discussion before he left, but we were both too busy. I feel like this is the kind of conversation best had in person, not via text or phone call or even facetime.
• He has two job offers (either would be ~2hrs by plane, basically interstate). He was upfront and did mention this possibility on our second date, but it was still early days so I thought let's just see where things go. Well, now it's getting complicated. 
• He's still making his decision about what job offer to take (only just had the interviews/offers before Christmas). He's talking things over with his parents, so again, I've wanted to give him some time to think things through.
• I don't want to stand in the way of his career and professional development. Either job would be a good move for his career, a logical next step, but I'm not certain I could/would follow him by moving to these locations unless we were really serious and further into the relationship.
• There aren't many great job prospects for me in those areas (kinda regional), and it would mean upending my life, although I'm also facing many forks in the road professionally right now).
• If he takes either job, he'd probably be staying there for 1-2 years and there is the possibility of him buying a home, something he can't as easily afford right now in our city.
• I don't want to scare him by asking him to commit, but at the same time, I don't want to waste my time if this isn't going somewhere (I'm a women in her mid-30s, biological clock is a tickin'). I'm also scared that we're just starting to get to know each other properly and gain momentum in the normal progression of relationships. Moving apart would likely hinder this process and could prematurely kill what might have been. 
• He has mentioned that if either job offer wasn't good enough, that he would consider staying in our city locally and finding work with another company (lots of comparable jobs on offer). I don't want to sway him one way or the other, but for context, he has considered staying locally (but I think he's seriously considering both offers).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rpl14x/help_how_to_have_the_commitment_conversation_when/
59,rpl2nh,1640602731,"Woman I have been talking to for 2 months, randomly blew up on me last night","So, I have been seeing this person for around 2 months. We've been regularly talking everyday, making phone calls, and have been on multiple dates. She has even stayed the night at my place multiple times. Started to notice some red flags from her. Every conversation we pretty much had, always reverted back to her complaining about her work, coworkers, family, or anything going on in her life. I don't mind people occasionally venting, but she constantly complained and was negative pretty much every single day I talked to her after the first 3-4ish weeks we initially met. Another red flag I noticed, was that she was being pedantic over my texting. One day, I was hanging out with my step sister, and she tried calling me, and I responded with, ""Out with someone right now. Will call you back later.""

She took offense to me saying, ""someone"" and she basically demanded that I clarify who I am out with. I let her know that I don't have to clarify who I am out with every single time I go out, and that we weren't even together, so I don't have to say who it is (I ended up telling her it was my step sister for piece of mind though). I let her know from the go, I was remaining exclusive and even if I was seeing another person, that I wouldn't be an ass and tell her I was out on another date...She just didn't trust me when I told her ""someone"". 

So last night, after Christmas with my family, I called her late at night. She was in an awful mood from work and she cut the conversation short. I ended up going to sleep and I kid you not, she called me back at 3:00 am in the morning... It woke me up, but I didn't pick up because I wanted to go back to sleep. As the day went out, I just sent her a text saying, ""Hey, just wondering what were you calling about last night?"" She got pissed, and texted me, ""Excuse me!"". I then called her back and she blew up on me over the phone out of nowhere for me texting her, why she called me last night. I was getting a little ticked off, but I was biting my tongue and being vague in the conversation. She just kept ranting on and grilling me out. She then yelled at me, "" I AM GETTING OFF THE PHONE!""  I hung up the phone after she yelled at me, and then she sent me an angry message telling me to go ahead and block her phone number...I told her that I enjoyed hanging out and talking with her, but that she  unnecessarily blew multiple things out of proportion for me asking a simple question. I told her I will not tolerate someone blowing up on me out of nowhere, and talking to me like this. Told her I was not interested anymore, thanked her for showing her true self to me early on, and blocked her number after that. 


Just thought I should share my experience and story with someone. Sucks, that I talked to this person for a bit and it happened right after Christmas, but oh well...

60,rpl3y4,1640602849,Does she want more than friendship? (Co-worker in fast food),"Myself (22 M) and a 20 year old female hit it off the first time we met and around the 3rd shift working together (where it was just us two in the shop) we held eye contact for over 15 seconds while smiling at each other without talking- We are both somewhat introverted and there had been very little verbal compliments due to the shop being audio monitored constantly by the boss- so I took this as a sign that she was somewhat interested in me along with the fact that she was never scared to 'bump' into my personal space, but with every other coworker she makes sure to keep her distance.

Another 3-4 shifts go by just making small talk until one shift where she randomly comes up to me where me and my other coworker were working and asks what I'm doing after work, I was stupid at the time and gave her an honest answer of 'sleeping'- my dumb ass didn't work out that it was 99% a cue for me to ask her what she was doing and if she wanted to do something after work. We had been texting about work to each other prior so I thought I better start giving her signals that I'm interested so I started putting x's at the end of texts and she responded by doing the same, also added her on FB to see if she had a BF- which she didn't so everything was going well.

I asked her at the end of both our shifts if she wanted to get some food with me and she had the biggest smile on her face and said yes, we got some fast food and just talked about life for a couple of hours getting to know each other- It seemed clear to me that she was comfortable around me as she started opening up about family problems, she was also laughing quite a bit so I felt it had went well.

About 2-3 days pass until we were working together again and I ask her if she wants to hang out again after work but said she was busy- fair enough, not every shift we're on together automatically means we should hang out so I asked again after a week had past and she again said no so I took this as the last time I'd ask face to face given that it seemed like all I was doing now was bugging her while losing any self respect I had left. It had now been about 2 and a half weeks since we last spoke outside of work yet she was still showing interest during work hours so I messaged her after work saying we should catch up next week if she wasn't busy and she texted back 'of course'. The week arrives so I asked her over text if she wanted to go out to a certain place for food on the day we both had off- I waited 2 full days for her response and got nothing and never got a reply- I would've been gutted if she had replied 'no' but not even replying really got to me.

I started backing off again and thought to myself that shes probably only likes the attention I give her and that I'm her 'eye candy' to look at during work but once work is over she wants nothing to do with me. I started removing the xs from the end of texts and treated her like every other coworker- it took her a total of 1 shift for her to message me and ask if I wanted to hang out with her after work. We did and spent 3 hours in the back of her car talking and watching videos, we did the same thing about 4 days later- this time she brought up the conversation of her ex and how she dated him for a couple of years- I wasn't threatened by this but did wonder why would someone mention an ex out of the blue, it seemed like a sign that she was thinking of us becoming something, but I always 2nd guess myself. I suggested the idea of doing something outside of just hanging out only after work has finished, she seemed keen but maybe she was just being friendly.

She does seem to have a few guy friends she messages which is a bit strange considering most women where I live are only friends with their own gender, when I ask her about she met them ( not in a threatning way) she says they are 'just old school friends/mates'- For me shes indicating to me that shes single (I've never asked her but of course know through FB), or shes sleeping around. Is there anything I can say or do that can test the waters and she if she does want a relationship ? If I do straight up ask her I feel like it will just lead to another disappointment like when she didn't even reply to my text about meeting up,and then there is the problem of having to face the awkwardness at work every day we work together if there is rejection.

70,rpnotf,1640612141,"If you receive a compliment, don’t respond by downplaying it, or by giving a compliment in return","This may seem like a small or inconsequential behavior, but the ability to receive a compliment graciously is extremely important in social interactions.

Even if you are attempting to be humble, downplaying a compliment will backfire. When someone gives a compliment, they are putting themselves out there. Downplaying a compliment is in essence a form of rejection; if their compliment is sincere, you are negating a feeling they had about you and were willing to express. They will be less likely to open themselves up to you in that manner in the future. Additionally, downplaying a compliment will make you seem insecure and unsure of yourself, not humble.

The same holds true for returning compliments. On the surface, it seems like a friendly and polite thing to do. However, it comes of as being insincere. You are not giving someone a compliment based on something they did themselves, but rather as a favor for saying something nice about you. This will likely make them feel the opposite of how you intended when you returned the compliment.

If you receive a compliment, embrace it. If someone says something to you that is impactful, try to stay present in the moment and remember it for when you need it in the future. There is nothing egotistical about this. Tell them how it makes you feel. Simply saying “Thank you, that means a lot to me” is all you need if you mean it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rpnotf/if_you_receive_a_compliment_dont_respond_by/

(Alt relationship kink community.)  BUT in honesty, in my life.... I've been a sucker for toxic e girls and have had some relationships with a few insta ""models"" that were less than healthy for me. I'll spare the details but a sad e girl vibe used to send me loopy and I'd ignore about any red flag. Licking knives you say? Well... maybe she likes cooking?... maybe we could settle down and I could get her a whole cutlery set?... wrong. Very wrong. 

I'd end up trusting people I never should have and believed they wanted more than sexual fantasy... never ended up that way and ironically enough I'd end up being used for sex and dumped lol left pining over someone who never cared about my happiness or life

So after a year off social media i feel actually ready to resist e girls. I feel GROWN. I can't stand drama and the idea of a girl begging me to stay on the phone until 3am and ignore my need for sleep or life schedule etc... sounds nauseating. Clingy used to be cute, the constant whines for attention seemed adorable at the time but now is just... no. Go to sleep. And no not in the cute I'm tucking you in way like. Girl. Go..to...sleeep....

From here. Its librarians and turtle necks baby. Wear them glasses at girl? I know you need them shits to see and not just so it doesn't get in your eye ;)  Oh you got a knife? Let's make sandwich! no need to stab me a little ;) oh you didn't text back fast? Nice, you probably taking time for yourself in a healthy way and I fully support it.

When I was younger (16-22), women used to show interest (in a subtle manner, like prolonged eye contact, smiling, acting shy around me), but at that time I was very shy myself, and with a low sex drive, which made me clueless on how to approach the situation.

Fast-forward to today, I think my sex drive has improved, I work out and have thoughts about having s.ex with women, but I've become quite anti-social and angry. Somehow the idea of making the first move pisses me off, I always stop myself, thinking, do I really need sex? I feel like women are still interested, but they are afraid of me (in a sense that they would not dare to even look at me). So I go around thinking, If she can't even look at me, is it really worth my time, to tone myself down, just to accommodate her (you probably would say, of course, you should accommodate her, but that's how breakups happen because people can't be themselves around each other).

My family keeps telling me to go and just meet a girl, but I get frustrated because I do not feel the genuine desire (I have a sex drive, but not romantic/relationship drive), coupled with women not giving subtle signals anymore.

So I live out in rural Ohio. The place isn’t teaming with young singles, but I love the area. I’ve got a graduate degree, and I am an intellectual. That sounds cocky, but I don’t mean for it to. What I mean by this is that I like high conversation: politics, religion, literature, etc. I have cultured interests. That also makes dating difficult, but again, I love it here.

So, let’s get a few other things about me: I’m 30. I am in great shape. Am I a Victoria’s Secret model? No, but I know I’m pretty. I take care of myself. I have eclectic but cute style that guys usually compliment me on.

Again, normally I have no problem getting men, it’s just the match that is difficult.

A friend of mine’s mother has a friend (the chain here...) whose so moved to town a year ago. I am told “add him on Instagram! He’s lonely.”

I did just that - I’m 29 at that point, he’s in his 30s. What’s the big deal? It’s not like this is middle school. And again, I’m confident (most of the time), so I have no qualms about approaching a man first. 

I said something in an Instagram message along the lines of “Hi! My name is *Kara*, and your mom’s friend *Linda* said we should maybe meet, that you’re new to town.”

Please know that by this, I did not mean “meet me around the tool shed sometime,” I meant, “we should grab coffee.”

Two weeks go by, but I finally hear from him, and he’s added me back on Instagram. 

Okay, maybe he’s not on Instagram all the time. Most guys aren’t. That’s cool.

He replies that he’d love to meet and that he hasn’t met a lot of people here yet.

I start suggesting places, since he’s new here. 

CRICKETS. And I can see that he’s seen it, because it’s Instagram.

Well, this continues to go on. He’ll message me that he likes my sweater, or that I look pretty, or he’ll send me videos of cute animals... and goes on for a year. I ask if he wants to meet at the local coffee shop, and I won’t hear from him for two months, but here’s the first weirdest (it’s all bizarre): 

I’m a social media influencer (not major, but I get paid to post for some brands) and a lot of people look at my story, but I kid you not, this guy is consistently one of the very first people to look at my story, even when I post during the day, when I know he’s working! Why? He clearly has no interest in meeting me, right? He’s been playing coy for a whole year, and I have dated other people, because I am not going to wait around on some guy who is scared to meet me, right? But why does he clearly have an alert on my posts? It’s not like I’m a bikini model... I’m telling people which moisturizer is the best, or which J.Crew sweater I’m wearing today. 

In the meantime, people who have NO IDEA what’s been going on are trying to set us up, and I know on good authority he’s super single.

So, I kid you not, a YEAR goes by, and he messages me on Instagram, asking me if I want to come over to his place. I’ve gathered enough from his bajillion videos of cats and dogs that he’s not going to try and have sex with me. This is clearly a friends thing. He apparently has an indoor pool and tells me to bring a swimsuit. Okay. Again, this is a friends thing.

Well, I go over, and it’s totally a friends vibe - he is so awkward, laughing at things I say that no one usually would or should laugh at, almost like he doesn’t know what to do. That’s fine, but we’re having a great time, anyway. Then, we get in his pool, and I’m not in there two seconds and he’s pulling me on top of him, and he’s got a boner. He’s telling me about how left out he feels because all of his friends are married with kids and he is single and childless. All while grinding on my ass.

As you could expect, this isn’t where I saw this going. So I’m like “maybe he wants to?” I keep turning around, thinking he’ll kiss me, but nope, just keeps subtly touching my boobs and  being flirty. 

Dude does not kiss me, but I leave at 1:00 AM and go home...

And don’t hear from him again about meeting up for SEVEN WEEKS.

So, at this point I’m too curious to say no.

I go over to his house, because apparently he’s allergic to a social life, and no one has seen him at a restaurant in town, ever. We drink a bit, he doesn’t touch me, and then BAM! The pool is boner city.

At this point, I’m like “what are we doing?”

He thinks I’m pretty, funny, and great to hang out with, but he “is just going at his own pace.” 

Own pace? Can you imagine what being strung along on line for a year feels like, then have your ass used as a boner cushion by a guy who is too scared to kiss you or have sex with you? He appears to have to get liquored up before he has the confidence to touch me, meanwhile, I’m over here wondering why my boobs and ass are good enough to practically dry hump but I cannot be kissed. He then tells me about how I’m the first girl he’s felt comfortable letting over to his house, which is sweet, but also... you have been here for over a year now.

So I leave again. He doesn’t hug me, and I tell him that friends that live in the same town don’t go seven weeks without seeing each other. He seems to understand.

Meanwhile, he’s scared to use my phone number, but feels fine messaging me on Instagram. What’s scary about my phone number? It’s a PHONE NUMBER. 

Reader, I am lost. What is wrong with this guy? He’s cute, funny, but seems to be lacking confidence. Is he a virgin? Gay in the closet? I’m not sure. I just know I’d like to kiss him and have sex with him but he’s terrified of me, it seems.

The thing is, despite how awkward he is, I’m attracted to this guy. He’s mostly sweet, and seems to be really shy. I just am at a loss for what I should (or should not) do. I’m the more experienced one here, I think, which is weird, given that i can count all the guys I’ve slept with on one hand.

TLDR: Guy seemingly likes me but moves at the pace of a snail.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rpsd0x/help_i_30f_am_not_understanding_this_man_34_at/
98,rpsd9n,1640625867,I need some suggestions!,"Me (20M) been dating this girl (18W) for almost 5 months, we are currently in a LDR, the way we pleasured ourselves most of the time is sexting, rarely masturbate on facetime together, or I send her videos of me masturbating. Our time zones is different (12 hours difference at the moment) so that’s why we barely masturbate together on FaceTime. Today we had a topic we’ve discussed about which ended up not talking for almost a full day yesterday and thankfully we fixed things together. Before she went to bed I told her I’m gonna send her a masturbation video like I’ve always done most of the time and she said “don’t send it, I don’t like it” and made me wonder why is she saying this right now and not before since she doesn’t even like it, she used to enjoy it but now it seems like she doesn’t like it. Does anyone has a opinion on why or what made her change her mind?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rpsd9n/i_need_some_suggestions/
99,rpsflt,1640626045,refusing to use her money on our date.,"(I’m on mobile)

This lady and I went on a date, we hung out for like 6 hours. And through the night she had offered to buy me: food, drinks, into the bars. I respectfully declined all her advances. I wasn’t trying to be chivalrous by any means, I was just like damn … save your money ; you’re in school for crying out loud.

After our date concluded, I was very confident our date went wonderfully! However  , I tried to message her a few days later and she ghosted me (left me on read)
:/ …. 

Did I insult her by refusing to use her money? If so, can you tell my why ?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rpsflt/refusing_to_use_her_money_on_our_date/
