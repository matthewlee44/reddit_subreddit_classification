I can‚Äôt put my finger on it. I have no idea how I know but I‚Äôve never been wrong. In many situations it‚Äôs almost instant. I‚Äôve had this ‚Äúability‚Äù since being a teen. 

It‚Äôs one of the reason I think I have anxiety around certain women.

I know this sounds arrogant but when I look back at my life, it‚Äôs saved me from lots of humiliation and dealing with rejection. 

It‚Äôs also kept me from falling into a trap I see my friends get into when they approach someone they have no chance with.

4,qm2bwz,1635968203,Update ‚Äì 32M wanting to date 24F ‚Äì the final outcome,"  

Last week, I asked for your advice on what to do and whether or not a girl likes me. So, I told her how I felt, and here‚Äôs the outcome.

It was Monday.

I asked her how her weekend was, and she said it was uneventful. But, she told me this story of how she got to work on time despite falling down a hill as she trekked through a park near her house to get to the bus stop, then forgetting her purse with ID. So, she had to go back. It sounded like a crappy start to the day and new month. I smiled, and I felt sorry for her.

I took her to dinner. There, I glanced over after she put her phone down and I saw a text conversation with someone, and there was an emoji: ‚ù§Ô∏è. My heart sank right there, as I could tell she was interested in someone else, and that somebody else was not me.

My initial plan was to tell her about my weekend, which involved some friends roasting me. I brought up how we became friends, and it seemed to go well.

I drove her home, and despite what I saw earlier, I went for it: I told her I had something to tell her and that I would regret it if I didn‚Äôt. 

I told her that I sensed that she trusts me. She said she ‚ÄúYes, I trust you.‚Äù I told her that I enjoyed spending time with her and that I feel content when I‚Äôm around her, like nothing bad could happen. I added: ‚ÄúI feel like you at least enjoy spending time with me as well, or at least you tolerate me the best you can.‚Äù She smiled and then nodded. From there, I brought up that some friends suggested we be together and brought up some lighthearted stories, and she laughed at those stories, including a man we know who claims to be in his 80s (we both know his real age) who told me, ‚ÄúIf you marry \_\_\_\_\_, you‚Äôll have plenty of reasons to shop at Costco.‚Äù I then told her that I liked her.

Then, the moment came, and she said: ‚ÄúThank you for your honesty.‚Äù She paused and told me she had been talking to someone she met at her sister‚Äôs wedding and she had been talking to him on a regular basis ever since she came back. She added he was going to visit, but she referred to him as her ‚Äúfriend.‚Äù

I thought about telling her how I felt about her before she went to the wedding, but I couldn‚Äôt find the right moment.

Even though it did not work out, I have no regrets and have turned to some close friends for support and comfort. However, one of my female friends crept her Facebook profile and questioned her choice in men, who she described as ‚Äútrailer trash types‚Äù and that I should know what I‚Äôm worth and aim for higher quality women.

From my close friend‚Äôs perspective, she is not worth my time because my 24-year-old went to aesthetician school while I have a BSc and a networking technician certificate and work in IT. However, that is her opinion, and I feel like she only said that in a bid to make me feel better about the situation.

On the bright side, the lady I hoped to pursue was completely honest with me and I believe it is still possible to be friends. For now, my ego is bruised and my heart is a bit broken.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qm2bwz/update_32m_wanting_to_date_24f_the_final_outcome/

We met out for dinner (casually after work nothing fancy), met up to talk/coffee/walks a few times. We got on really well so he invited me over. We watched a movie and he cooked me dinner. We cuddle but nothing happened because I went home quickly.

The next time he invited me round his flat, he cooked me dinner and we sat and talked. Instead of watching a movie we cuddled for a bit and things escalated (not sex but foreplay).

We‚Äôve seen each other since but still haven‚Äôt had sex because I don‚Äôt want to. He‚Äôs open to it but I think it‚Äôll complicate things since he‚Äôs not my boyfriend.

I think this has made him feel a bit insecure or paranoid. He asked me if I‚Äôm talking to anyone else and I am so I was honest about that. I asked him if he‚Äôs seeing anyone else and he said ‚Äúwell I am single‚Äù. I said ‚Äúfair enough‚Äù and left shortly after because it got tense. 

We were just on the phone now and I told him I want to see him and he said he was going out. He asked if I was asking to see him one last time before I got bored and stopped talking to him. 

I was so confused, why is he ruining things? I like him sure but we‚Äôre fine as we are. I don‚Äôt plan on meeting anyone else and I‚Äôm enjoying the moment. Why can‚Äôt he go with the flow?

18,qm3wfd,1635972569,I need some other opinions on this,"

So me and my ex broke up about a month ago lasting about 1.5 years. I just finished high school and she is still attending. We were both immature and argued a lot. We both hurt eachother many times which eventually led to her breaking up with me. It‚Äôs a good time to mention that she had an ex from middle school and they were best friends. He left her and later on he apologized and they stayed friends. Once me and her started dating in high school I told her to cut him out and she did. Well towards the back end of the breakup she added him on Instagram and I let her since she did ask me. We would argue and at night she would go to him for support since I wasn‚Äôt always there. Eventually we broke up and I told her to choose me or him and she chose him because ‚Äúhe wasn‚Äôt making me choose‚Äù. Anyway, I fought for her after the breakup but with no success. It was running its tail end anyway since we both weren‚Äôt very happy. She told me that he had changed and he made her happy. Ofc he was going to make her happy when they arnt dating since he wants another chance. They are both still in high school now and are taking things slow. He messaged me saying to stop texting her and ‚Äúwe are on the same page and will get married‚Äù okay lol. But I‚Äôve been no contact with her for a few days now and just want another opinion on if they will last. They used to be close and now they are trying again.

Unfortunately we both lead somewhat busy lives and I find we both keep apologizing for late responses lol it's like we're Canadian. 
I work a lot and I'm constantly moving to and from doing stuff and it can be difficult to keep a conversation sometimes. 
I imagine she's pretty busy as well, she's an interior designer plus she's a single mom. 

For instance our conversations can be back and forth for an hour and then the next we can be replying every other hour lol 
Please note I'm guilty of this too. I like my independence, I'm actually that person that can go to a movie alone and still quite enjoy myself. Though I would love to have the right person to enjoy stuff like that with too. 

I don't mind because I feel like it's going great regardless it's not a one sided conversation and she's showing me clear interest. 
I mean everyone has a life of their own and I think it's a good thing we can still find and dedicate sometime to the people we like (or at least try)

26,qm4lgv,1635974498,"She stares a lot, but seems hesitant otherwise","We're both 16, and I have two classes with her. We have a lot of similar interests, we both play soccer, a lot of the same classes, etc. when I realized I was crushing on her, I noticed she stares back, and it will be many times each class. She'll glance over and look back, her eyes will linger as she looks across the room, or sometimes just stare for a few seconds. We make eye contact occasionally, sometimes she looks away quickly but sometimes it lasts for a second or two, and I try to only look if I can see her already looking out of the corner of my eye. She's usually a really shy person, like she talks very quietly around people she doesn't know or when presenting something, so that's what kinda surprised me about the staring. I have noticed she sometimes stares at the floor by my feet too, but idk if that means anything.

In one of our classes, we can move around to work, and I have friends at her table, so I go over and talk to her.  We can make pretty easy conversation, I can make her laugh and she poked fun at my handwriting because a lot of the letters I write look like s, I don't close the back of letters like g or b. She'd also glance at me a lot when I was listening to the other girl at the table to see if I was paying attention to the other girl. 

So this is all going well enough, I ask her for her number and she gives it to me, she didn't really give any signs if she was happy or confused by it. I text her a question about soccer, she responds after a day, and then she doesn't respond. I asked her a week later why she didn't, she said she was at soccer and just forgot. That's reasonable enough, but she'd been staring a lot that week so at the very least I'd been on her mind, which I would kinda expect a response. 

The issue is, we moved tables this week and she doesn't sit with any of my friends now, so I don't have an excuse to talk to her. She also usually leaves class quickly, so i don't have a good time to catch her after class. So, I don't know when to talk to her to try and gauge how interested she is. Yesterday, we were standing with our table groups out in the hall and I was behind her, and she glanced  over her shoulder multiple times, and when I moved to behind her other shoulder, she glanced over that shoulder. I wish I went over and talked to her then, but she seems to only want to look and not come over to talk to me either.

So, idk if she's interested and shy, or just confused why I show interest, or if she thinks I send mixed signals",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qm4lgv/she_stares_a_lot_but_seems_hesitant_otherwise/

29,qm4vfh,1635975254,Did she like me or did I mistake it for love?,"So I work at a restaurant that I‚Äôve been at for about a year already and then during the summer a new girl came to work there for the first month or so we didn‚Äôt really see each other. I worked a Night Shift and she worked day shift so I would normally come in to clock at the same time she was clocking out so in terms of talking to her or any type of communication was 0 of course I did ask around co workers for her name which I already knew since all our names are on the schedule but I just wanted to ask about her but i kept my interest low. 

Shortly after the summer ended she started working night shifts so at this point I started seeing her more regularly and eventually when I was in the back of the house prepping some stuff she happened to be back there but I didn‚Äôt say anything until she said ‚ÄúI have a question‚Äù and I said ‚Äúyeah what‚Äôs up?‚Äù. I thought she was just going to ask me a question about the job or something work related but she asked me about my age. I didn‚Äôt think much of it at the time but I just told her I was 20 and she was 18 but she was surprised and thought I was younger like 16 or 17 and she laughed and honestly from there on we started having more conversations and I thought she was funny so I enjoyed talking to her.

Now here is when I started falling in love with her. We would only see each other at work so I caught myself wanting to go to work just to see her. We would start getting closer like I always play fighting and it would only be with me she rarely talked with other co workers and that‚Äôs when I started getting questions from my co workers if we were dating. It caught me by surprise because I asked them why they thought that and they all told me it‚Äôs because she is always next to me and talking to me. I would be in the back prepping food and she would pass by and jokingly say ‚Äúyour working too slow‚Äù or sometimes I would be washing dishes and she‚Äôd come by and drop some dishes off and try to have a conversation with me. There was times we would get a little touchy like I would be doing something and she would poke me or poke my ass but in a flirty way because for some reason girls like to poke a guys butt to see how they react. I went along with it and sometimes I would slap her ass after she did that and she would laugh and keep it pushing like nothing happened.

Then came a time when I asked for her number and her Instagram and she gave it to me. I was also driving her home on the weekends since she had no ride and she so happened to stay right near my neighborhood so it became a thing that everyone thought we were dating because of how we acted and we were riding together after work. I started falling love during this time because after work she said she didn‚Äôt want to go home so early because she‚Äôs bored at home even though it was already 11pm when we got out of work. So me liking her and being cool with idea of chilling with her alone after work was appealing so it became it a thing to just park somewhere after work at night either grab something to eat and talk for hours or sometimes just listen to music and chill. Her mom would sometimes call her asking her where she was at because we would get carried away sometimes and it would be like 2am and she would tell her mom that the Uber was taking long to pick her up or she would come up with an excuse but never told her she was with some guy from work and I didn‚Äôt know what to think of that But I never asked. I remember some nights we would get close to each other like once she was showing her camera roll on her phone of pics and vid‚Äôs of her or funny vids and k would be leaning on her and she would be playing with my hair. Another time when I was taking her home she put her legs on my lap while i drove her home one hand on the steering wheel and the other hand on her legs/thigh and at this point I was thinking she has to like me theres no way she doesn‚Äôt like me. 

One day I came to work and they told she had quit and I kept thinking about it and wondering why. She didn‚Äôt tell me or anyone she just called the manager and said she quit. I was sad but I never texted her until a month after she quit and it was to tell me happy birthday which she saw on my Instagram story and from there I started conversation and she told she quit to get another job that was paying better. I eventually asked her if she wanted to hang out some day and she said sure that she would be down to but it should be next month since she was busy that month and I was happy because at this point I was going to take her out and then tell her I like her which I should‚Äôve done sooner I know but I felt like this would be the perfect time to do it. Next month came and once again she swiped up on my story which she saw that I was on a trip and we started talking about hanging out which she said yes to but then asked out of no where the next week that if the reason I want to hang out with her is because I like her. I froze and told her the truth that yeah I do like her that‚Äôs why I wanted to hang out and see her again. She then told me that she has a boyfriend and he wouldn‚Äôt want her going out with a guy that likes her so I told her I understand and that I didn‚Äôt know she had a boyfriend which I never asked how long they‚Äôve been dating.

She‚Äôs super kind and patient. I had to postpone this date 2 different times because I was either sick or had last minute things to take care.

Well, last night we finally met up. I got there much later than anticipated because my car battery died but we went and got dinner at fast food and spent the night in a motel. We made out, did some things and cuddled in our birthday suits until this morning. We talked about all sorts of things in the night. From people lacking self awareness to how we think women have more power in certain aspects of the world than most realize to talking about how we can help people to things about our pasts.

Right before checkout time we decided that we‚Äôd spend another night together. So I paid for another night and we just cuddled all afternoon.

She has work she has to do for a couple hours but when she‚Äôs back, I‚Äôm gonna take her to a nice restaurant this time.

34,qm55dy,1635975999,Girl who keeps cancelling dates at the last minute,"In September, I (25M) randomly bumped into this girl (24F) from my country at a foreign archeology site and we started chatting. At the end of the conversation, she asked me if I'd like to go out with her after we both got home.

We had trouble setting a date, largely because she seems to be incredibly busy. Eventually we settled on a day but then she cancelled the day beforehand saying that she was staying with her parents and had been unavoidably detained. We rescheduled, this time it worked and the date went very well. She text me immediately afterwards saying that she had a great time.

It's another two weeks before we manage to arrange another day (this was mostly my fault this time because I was on a business trip and because we wanted to see a particular opera). This time she cancels on the day (without really giving a reason) and suggested this evening instead. I agree to the change because she's just started a new job but two hours before the rescheduled date, she cancelled again. This time, the citation given is that she's been put into a business meeting at the last minute.

While I guess that this isn't entirely her fault, I was still annoyed because I'd had a fairly bad day already. So I left her on seen, and she sent me another message of apology a few hours later. I still haven't replied, largely because I haven't decided how to.

Don't get me wrong, I really like her. It's just that this pattern of behavior is beginning to feel a little bit disrespectful. It's also that a complete inability to manage time effectively was a problem that my parents suffered from, and I'd rather like to avoid that particular hell.

I am just wondering what r/dating thinks about **little social media presence.**

This might mean I have social media accounts, but I do not post very often.

To me I find this an attractive trait because I know the person is not trying to gain attention, rely on social media to present themselves, or be attached to their phones all day.

We have a lot of similar interests, we both play soccer, a lot of the same classes, etc. when I realized I was crushing on her, I noticed she stares back, and it will be many times each class. She'll glance over and look back, her eyes will linger as she looks across the room, or sometimes just stare for a few seconds. We make eye contact occasionally, sometimes she looks away quickly but sometimes it lasts for a second or two, and I try to only look if I can see her already looking out of the corner of my eye. She's usually a really shy person, like she talks very quietly around people she doesn't know or when presenting something, so that's what kinda surprised me about the staring. I have noticed she sometimes stares at the floor by my feet too, but idk if that means anything.

In one of our classes, we can move around to work, and I have friends at her table, so I go over and talk to her. We can make pretty easy conversation, I can make her laugh and she poked fun at my handwriting because a lot of the letters I write look like s, I don't close the back of letters like g or b. She'd also glance at me a lot when I was listening to the other girl at the table to see if I was paying attention to the other girl.

So this is all going well enough, I ask her for her number and she gives it to me, she didn't really give any signs if she was happy or confused by it.

She also usually leaves class quickly, so i don't have a good time to catch her after class. So, I don't know when to talk to her to try and gauge how interested she is.

55,qm7hol,1635982749,I kinda feel like an asshole...,"So I met a guy about 2 weeks ago, (2 weeks on Friday), on a dating app and he's really gorgeous and funny and I like talking to him a lot, (I assume he also enjoys the conversation because he makes a strong point to keep it going/respond to everything I send). Thing is, it's been about 2 weeks and he *still hasn't asked me out*.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, this amongst a bunch of other stuff going on gave me a complete mental breakdown and I deleted the app because I want to take a break from human lifeforms. I didn't want to ghost him, but I didn't want to sit in a perpetual cycle of mental torment, either. I was actually planning on going back and sincerely apologizing whenever I feel better, (maybe a week or two?) because I know how much someone poofing on you can suck.

&amp;#x200B;

**The meaty bits:** 

So when we first started talking I really enjoyed it, and it seemed he liked it too. We joke around a bit, (I try to not joke around too much because historically for me men get *terrified* if they laugh too much. Basically letting him lead, blah blah, whatever,) and we had some VERY mentally stimulating conversations about all sorts of stuff like philosophical and political stuff. HOWEVER, I'm not an idiot and I know guys make a move when they truly like someone. That being said, 2 weeks is a long ass time to not ask someone out, unless you're the kind of person who moves incredibly slow. *(It's fine if you do, but I'm not into wasting time.)*

&amp;#x200B;

I told myself maybe he's shy? He always made it a point to make sure I didn't think he was creepy or coming on too strong with his jokes. Like, he'd back off really hard over mild jokes, (we both have dark humor,) and say sorry and swear he's not a creep, etc. etc. When I was simply laughing my butt off at the joke. I assume someone (or multiple) girls have called him creepy in the past, but I also know his ethnic friends' wives and girlfriends tend to respond to him negatively because he's white, (I know some people hate talking about race, but that's just how the world is sometimes.) I mean, if anything, I'm creepier than he is I made a sexual joke before he did and he deflected back to food, lol.

&amp;#x200B;

So in essence, I'm under the assumption that I am friendzoned or he is unsure of what he wants or perhaps he's not getting the connection he wants. That's fine, I just wish he would've said something sooner because I have been *very* patient in my eyes. I'm honestly ""looking"" (strong word) for a fuck buddy, he seemed interesting and cute enough to be around, (I might add Im not opposed to dating if it gets to it,) so I swiped right. He wants a potential life partner, saw me, and apparently also swiped right. When I got the message we matched, I was convinced it was a mistake, (he's the cutest of 3 guys I've swiped on in the past 4 months,) because he is looking for something different and he's like, SUUUUPER cute. Apparently he actually did it on purpose because I said hi and he said hi back, lol.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel bad about it all because I was kinda getting to like him, but I am quite irritated we haven't been on a first date within 2 weeks. That's a super long time to just be anonymous words on the internet. Yes, we have pics, but they could be of anyone. Not saying hes catfishing or I am, that's just the reality of the internet. You don't truly know someone until you're in front of them in person and speaking, you just have to *assume* they're not lying to you online.

&amp;#x200B;

I also assume that he has plenty of other girls to talk to, (mostly to comfort myself over feeling bad,) because it doesn't make sense that if he were truly interested he would take so long to say anything. I'm thinking it could be his first time on a dating app, but that's too many presumptions and not enough evidence so it means nothing at this point. Idk what I'm gonna do, probably just go back and say sorry later, but I did basically make the first move with everything. Maybe I move too fast, but it's just strange to me to not get someone's number or a date when you start to hit it off. I asked him on a date and he just said we can figure it out later when the conversation was getting good, but I really don't need a penpal or more online friends. I have plenty of those already.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to go back just yet because I'm still having my breakdown (which may or may not be obvious), but I do feel really bad and want to go say sorry... I just kinda wanna plan out what I'm gonna tell him for closure. I don't want to wait around while he weighs options with other women, (which is fine. This is a dating app you're supposed to do that,) and basically just compliment him, flirt with him, and drop hints just for his ego. I also don't want to just super aggressively rush in and say something stupid like ""So how do you feel about me??"" so soon because that's just weird and... well, *too* aggressive for something so brief. Even I wouldn't respond well to something like that. Maybe some ideas will help and I'll talk to him sometime this weekend, but I'm hoping I get over all that's bothering me in a couple days so I can at least say bye to him. I could at least pay him that courtesy even if I feel my time isn't being respected, lol.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qm7hol/i_kinda_feel_like_an_asshole/

58,qm7o89,1635983295,Humiliation," So there are these 2 girls in my class who im going to call g1 and g2 (I don't have crushes on them) and they decided it would be funny to prank me. Badly. 

BACKSTORY: I used to be quite large but I worked out and got thinner, I was proud of myself and thought I was on top of the world so I was quite gullible. 

Anyway, I was blinded by how I thought I looked and they knew that. They sent a paper aeroplane over to me that was a love letter (They faked it from a girl I don't have a crush on). I took the letter and opened it. 

It said '**I like you, do you feel the same way'** with 2 boxes that said yes and no. One of my friends (A) who was in on the prank told me to say no while the other (B) who was also in on it told me to say yes. I didn't do anything, I just put it in my bag and forgot about it.

 Throughout the day they were asking me how I felt and my only response was 'Idk maybe'. I told some of my friends that I was 'asked out' and the news didn't spread that much. It isnt too bad but Im now contemplating 'Why me?' and ive began to realise why they did it. 

1. Im an easy target.

 2. Im blinded by my weight loss. 

3. I used to have a crush on the girl(G3) that they pretended it was from 

4. They know I am **VERY** socially awkard and start to shake (obviously) when I get into an uncomfortable situation. 

5. Im a loser who has never been in a relationship.

Every date went well. we message maybe once a day.

I think she's losing interest.

‚Ä¢ She doesn't ask me out. i always have to do it...  
‚Ä¢ I asked her out today for Saturday and she ‚Äúthinks she's busy (but will let me know)‚Äù

My guess is she'll offer another day. Although, I wanted her to come over.

One thing to throw in is perhaps she wants a ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù and is frustrated I'm not taking action. she hinted at this early on. But subsequently said she's just come out of a long term thing and happy without ‚Äúno pressure‚Äù right now.

**Two questions** 

a) Next time we meet I think I'm going to bring up ‚Äúwhat we are‚Äù.  Any advice on how (or if) to do that?

b) In the meantime... I should cool off myself? The alternative is mention something on text.

She as my fianc√© cheated, left with a rich guy, manipulated me, and attacked me at a spiritual level by calling me ugly, fat and broke in many psychologically disgusting ways. After years of pain, finding a loving community of friends and traveling, I did (and still doing what I can) to re-gain my self esteem/confidence. I learned to lift my head up, got my degree, had professional experiences where I worked with several world leaders. People say they're inspired by me etc... things that should get my ego up. Despite everything, I still felt - fat, ugly and somewhat broke because the way someone I loved and trusted hurt me. A few weeks ago I had a moment of enlightenment. Im starting to workout, be healthy and know that along with my achievements and the hard work I'm putting in - I am a total catch! However, I never really dated anyone since, for fear of getting hurt and rejected and relapsing into that dark hole of depression. Never felt any attraction for anyone until....FUCKING HALLOWEEN. I noticed this beautiful girl who happens to be a friend. Im the glue in my friend group, and she was well accepted into it. She talks to me like she's flirting but also acts like she's not into me. She knows I'm into her but she's one of those VERY pretty girls that gets a lot of attention.

Now what? At what point do you pick one? What is the general expectation here? At some point (conventionally) the goal is a committed long term relationship, but obviously you start out trying out a bunch of things, so at some point you have to cross over.  But at what point do you cut off any other prospects/stop going on dates in favor of investing in one person? Where does sex or just things like making out come in? For some people perhaps sex waits for that level of commitment, but for others maybe it's part of the road to get there, or just not that big a deal.

Context: 31M, big city, plenty of potential first dates. I had a conversation w/ someone who ruled me out because I expressed the perspective that it's OK to pursue various things in parallel when you're starting out, and that *could* include sex or lesser intimacies but would not necessarily, with the expectation that you'll eventually commit to one person.

78,qm95rw,1635987947,Advice for an Inexperienced University Student,"Hi everyone!

I am a uni freshman (M) who has never had much interaction with females, let alone a relationship back in highschool. This changed when I began university and was put into a group with a girl that I like. When there is nobody around us in lecture, we talk a lot about random stuff and are fully comfortable with each other since day one. On days where she doesn‚Äôt meet up with her friends, she walks with me back to the subway. We‚Äôve had 2 dates before (both initiated by her); one study date and one escape room+dinner date and I‚Äôd say both went very well. She willingly tried to fully pay the first two dates and we had a friendly fight over splitting the bill vs paying in full. Both times when we got food after, she‚Äôd always look out for me (refill water, put food on my plate, get me new plates without asking). Not much physical touch has happened yet as I am a bit shy and want to take things slowly.

I am a little bit intimidated as we both live entirely different realities. She comes from wealth and lives a luxurious lifestyle (parents bought her a condo in an upscale area, multiple yearly vacations, only takes uber, and so on) whereas I live a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù lifestyle. There‚Äôs also a bit of a difference in culture and language as she‚Äôs an international student but it hasn‚Äôt been an issue so far. I‚Äôm just a little bit concerned about how our differences may affect our compatibility or relationship (her having to compromise on cheaper dates, etc). 

Since this is all new to me, I‚Äôm wondering if she has an interest in me or does she just see me as a friend, but is willing to pay and go on dates because money doesn‚Äôt mean much to her and that she doesn‚Äôt have much friends in school? Should I take things slowly or should I speed things up and set up more dates with her? Any other suggestions or advice is much appreciated!

79,qm95xb,1635987961,Women only answer,"I recently made a post about how I have been dissatisfied with men and sex when it comes to dating. I prefer men who have larger penises (6-8 inches) and can last at least 15 minutes during actual intercourse. I don‚Äôt think my preference is that rare. I even said maybe I should be up front about my sexual preferences when talking to guys I‚Äôm interested in dating (of course not right away) but over text. That way it eliminates (although some men will still lie of course) the men who don‚Äôt match my preferences. All these people, I would guess men, started attacking my preferences 

. One person said I was strange to try to talk about men‚Äôs Dick size as a way to gauge if we are compatible. This was a guy saying this .Another person said that sexual satisfaction isn‚Äôt always up to the men and I need to ‚Äúown my own foreplay‚Äù. First off that doesn‚Äôt even make sense because if it takes women longer on average to orgasm, then the men should be ‚Äúowning the foreplay‚Äùand doing foreplay on women. Most men I‚Äôve been with sexually didn‚Äôt even offer to do foreplay. In my experience, most men I‚Äôve slept with were selfish in bed. But even besides that, I‚Äôm more of a penetration type of woman (with clitoral stimulation at the same time ) and foreplay doesn‚Äôt do much for me. I understand that men can‚Äôt control their Dick size, but health issues aside they can absolutely control how long they last in bed. That isn‚Äôt my problem. 

So ladies, what are your preferences? Are mine that rare? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs weird to talk about these things with men and be upfront and honest, how  else would I know!

The day after I asked her out again and she said yes!

After work I took her to a bar nearby, but she had a long drive home, so she went with an orange juice. I had a beer. We asked about each other's careers and different things that we kinda talk about with other people. I was so anxious about this date that I didn't even considered having some kind of strategy to gear the conversation towards something more date-like. We had some fun but I feel we were afraid to get more serious.

At some point, we seemed to hit a wall. Lots of awkward silences and I began feeling tipsy and slurring words. After 40 minutes or so, she said ""should we get going?"" and we parted ways. There was no kiss. Not a passionate embrace either. Just a friendly kiss on the cheek. I paid for everything, and she jokingly agreed to ""repay me with another beer in the future"".

I haven't dated in ... about 6? years. The last time I dated I was living in NYC, had a very large friend group, and met a lot of people out at parties, randomly, on the subway etc. 

The reason I stopped dating was I was just really unhappy, and about 5 months ago I started taking medication that makes me feel a lot better, went to a Halloween thing last weekend and it got me thinking about dating.

Now... I have like 5? acquaintances (in my area) that I will meet up with for drinks super randomly  maybe once a month (not dates, not romantic), and don't really have any clue how to go about dating because my social landscape is very different than the last time I dated.  I'm not comfortable with going up to a person I don't know and asking for their number etc.

&amp;#x200B;

My only really active hobby that I do is working out and I assume someone you fancy at the gym does NOT want anyone to try to pick them up, I mean that's not why I'm there either.

I was thinking of trying out a kickball league thing in my area, but it seems like it's just a few people (I'll probably try it out either way because it sounds like fun and I might meet some cool people). Other than that I'm kind of stumped.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qm9r6v/havent_dated_in_years_when_i_did_i_was_in_a_major/
88,qm9vmr,1635990232,He Isn't Physically Attracted to Me,"Okay this is so long. Bless you if you actually read it. 

So I (26f) started seeing a guy (32m) back in March of 2020 just after covid hit. 
We met on a dating app, but remained virtual for an entire year. He was in a polyamorous relationship with a severely immunocompromised woman. I fell in love with him.
We both got vaccinated and the reality of us meeting in person was becoming more and more impending. 
This pushed the other woman he was with over the edge. She was the one that originated the polyamory, but she had some issues with jealousy and their relationship had been having problems (which I was unaware of at the time.)
She came to me via Facebook and told me one night that he was abusive and that he had been bordering on violent when she wouldn't have sex with him. 
It rocked my world upside down and I genuinely had no idea what to do. I couldn't sake the feeling that something wasn't right, and doubts began to form based upon some other things she then said additionally. 
I eventually confronted him with what she told me and asked for his side of things. By his reaction alone, I could tell that he was the prudent and calm man I knew him to be. He ended up breaking up with her and moving out. 
She had some extremely unkind words for me. I ended up blocking her. 
We both got vaccinated and began finally spending time together in person (April 2021) 
We messed around the first time we hung out (had oral sex) but didn't actually have sex. Same with the second time, and the third. After about a month, we had a talk, he said he was getting ""more of a friend vibe"" so I began to pull back.... but we continued hanging out and things still seemed very gray.... and to get grayer by the day. 
We ended up going on  6 week vacation together. Where we had endless talks about what we are and what we're doing. 

It ultimately was revealed (after I pryed like holy hell) that he wasn't physically attracted to me, mostly in part due to my weight. I'm not obese like I once was, but I am still on my fitness journey and he has always been one for petite women. During that time I asked if he could see attraction happening as I continue down my weight journey, he said he thought so.

Since returning home we continued to see each other. And we have some physical stuff every so often. We cuddle and sleep next to each other naked pretty often. We go on dates, he pays for things, we know each other very deeply and intimately at this point. 
We spent the last 5 days together. Going to events and preparing for him to take a potentially lengthy trip. (At least a few weeks)
Last night I asked him point blank if the physical stuff had gotten worse, because it had been a while since he kissed me or since he let me blow him (which I love to do) He said no, but that he felt bad stringing me along physically when he just wasn't into it. 
He said he also felt bad because he knows I have needs and they aren't being met, and that he's worried about me wasting the latter half of my 20s waiting for him when he isn't committing. He listed off all the things that he loves about me and about us. But he also mentioned that he was worried because he doesn't know that it will ever get there, even with the weightloss. He said at this point we've gotten used to sleeping beside each other with nothing happening and I am unfortunately, entangled in this break up in a way. He says he feels almost guilty with his sex drive because the breakup was so centered around him and his ex not being sexually aligned. 

I know he had a one night stand in between the break up and now (we agreed to be physically open) and when I brought that up he said ""it's different, I didn't have a relationship with that person, I have a relationship with you""

I mentioned that I wanted to keep trying until our anniversary in March, I want to take the time and do everything that I can on my end. And if we still can't get it together by then to reevaluate. I love him so fucking much. I am willing to wait and be celibate (not that he's even requiring me to be) because he means so much to me. I told him that I can see us getting serious, that I could see a future with him and he agreed. 

Today I dropped him off at the airport and he kissed me a bunch and thanked me for everything. 


Does anyone have any recommendations on how I can help him clear this hurdle? Or how we can bridge this gap together? I know so much is rooted in the betrayal and the guilt he feels from the break up. I want to be able to help him get past that so that as I slim down, we can begin to really connect and the past won't get in the way. He thinks I'm pretty, so that's not a part of it. (And he's right, my face is v pretty.)

While it's important to note that the weight plays a role in this, I think the biggest hurdle is the hang ups he's facing from the last relationship/break up. It really is a deep wound.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qm9vmr/he_isnt_physically_attracted_to_me/
89,qma2sa,1635990886,She invited me over to her place but kept her distance (after lots of touching on the previous date!). I'm confused!,"Am I misunderstanding something?
First off, I was not going for any sexual activity at all.
We've gone on several great dates the past 2 months. The last date, we did something scary, and she was hanging on to me tight the whole time! I said we should do something again, and she invited me over. I went to her place, but she sprawled out on the other couch and was busy doing homework the whole time during the movie. It seemed pretty clear she wanted us to be on separate couches and did not want me close. I told her that I really liked her the previous date, and she said the same. Should I have made an aggressive move and stopped her from doing homework? Did I mess something up? I thought she would immediately want to be cuddly because of our previous date.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qma2sa/she_invited_me_over_to_her_place_but_kept_her/
90,qma55r,1635991093,Should I (24F) talk to my mutual friend about this guy (30sM) who didn't respond when I asked him out?,"* I met this guy in a Facebook Group for a hobby. He's a part of the group I have been hanging out with regularly the past few months.


* He's extremely shy. He's only made eye contact with me once and it was by accident. He has never talked to me. A few weeks ago there were five of us who just sat around in a circle after a meetup and just talked for hours. He stood the whole time and would only whisper to our mutual friend if he wanted to say something.


* Multiple people have confirmed that he's just very very shy and is especially shy around women.


* I asked him out Monday night and he never opened my message to look at it.


* I sent him very vaguely flirty messages a few weeks before saying that I want to talk to him. He didn't really flirt back or anything but he responded akin to the messages I sent. He gave very short responses a few times too and they said that that's just how he talks.


* I haven't seen him in over 3 weeks. After this weekend, I'm starting to suspect that he's avoiding me specifically. I went to two different events this weekend and had to skip a third. He didn't go to the first two that I posted on Facebook saying that I was going to. But he went to the third one that I posted on Facebook that I definitely couldn't go to.


* I'm thinking about messaging a mutual friend and asking him to ask the guy if I'm making him uncomfortable or maybe he is into me and is just *that* shy. I really think he's hot asf and really sweet, and absolutely hilarious too. I just wish I could talk to him.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qma55r/should_i_24f_talk_to_my_mutual_friend_about_this/
91,qma5j5,1635991128,"What advice would you give someone whos a little old to be inexperienced in bed?,","As the title implies, I'm worried I'm a bit too old to not be that experienced. I'm 24 and I've only ever had actual sex twice with one girl, not including a few handfuls of fooling around to lesser degrees.

I don't have any ""moves"" I hear you're supposed to have. I'm not the most confident in the bedroom either, though I try my best. And really the main thing is I'm concerned a potential romantic interest will... well, lose interest, upon hearing I'm not someone who's built up skill and technique through many partners or through hookups. 

I may be wrong, but I'm assuming thats what I was ""supposed"" to do, but I'm just not the hookup guy, plain and simple. So I mean... is it going to be as big a problem as I imagine it might be? Would most potential partners judge that or be offput knowing I'm probably not a porn star in bed? Or would most partners be open to being patient, or even into the whole thing? 

Is this one of those things where its more about confidence and stuff like that? Idk. Talk to me about it, give me some perspective here.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qma5j5/what_advice_would_you_give_someone_whos_a_little/
