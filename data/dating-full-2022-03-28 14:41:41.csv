Also, she asked me if I want to go with her on a club event but the tickets were already sold so I couldn't find any and I told her that next time I would go with her.

İt was on a language learning app, she wanted to learn English and i wanted to learn her language. We talked for a while and then she asked me for my Instagram/WhatsApp etc, so we shifted our conversations there. She's attractive and I've always had a thing for Turkish women. 
During the second week of our conversations on Whatsapp (~ a month of talking in total) i told her that i like her etc and i wanna be more than friends. She said no, she can never be with 'foreigners'. Even though I'm a middle eastern man, living in Canada (similar cultures, same religion), i was still not a Turk. Anyways, i said my goodbyes and left. The very next day she texted me, lets be friends for now and we made up again.

8 months later. İt's still the same bs. İ want her, and she doesn't apparently. İ understand her reasons, (or at least i try to) she says she hasn't seen me irl, and she can't fathom the thought of being with someone not from her culture. 

Also, during all this, we talked in lengths about our feelings. She told me several times that she likes me too, (i told her i loved her several times), she said she gets lonely without me (she doesn't have anyone else), she says she doesn't talk to other men because she feels like that'll be cheating on me (even though it makes no sense to me), she says no one cares for her as much as i do and it makes her feel even bad (not even her own family). 

She said no one ever gifted her anything ever, so i sent her gifts. 

She says that she wants to meet me, but i get confused, why would someone, who always keeps saying we can't be together (because of cultural differences) still linger around and also wants to meet me? 

She has a difficult life, i know. At some level i believe her too (that I'm the only one who cares/loves her etc), but whenever i want to leave or I'm frustrated or i  just wanna move on, we always decide to take a break and then some days later she'd text me again (this has happened many times, and every time she comes back). She will say sweet things, and I'll melt. Once that phase is over, its back to dry ass conversation and her kinda ghosting/airing me.

Now i know, i told this to my close friends and they say this is toxic af. I realize this too at some point/level, but because this is all online, we haven't met, i always wonder what if meeting her would solve this? Maybe it's the language barrier? I'm even learning turkish too, just for her.
So, I don't know.

I am looking for advice, or hope or whatever, because this shit is leeching my happiness, and my friends can no longer help me, as it gets very complicated by the minute. Also this is my side of the story, so I'd rather have you kind folk help me out. Can this be a fixable love story? Or am I doomed?

I'm (M) 20 years old and I'm finally putting myself out there for dating. 

Why now? Because I had a lot of personal issues that I'm finally resolving - I wasn't ready for a relationship a few years back, plus I know what its like to be an ""emotional dumping bag"", most of my friends use me for low-key therapy and interestingly for dating advice despite me never having dated before.

Being an emotianal dumping bag is truly exhausting. I didn't want to be ""that"" in a potential relationship. After all if you don't even love yourself how can you give it your all to another person? 

Appearance wise I'm quite average except for my height, (5'3-5'4) and eyebrows, apparently they look ""as if they were drawn on my face"".   I've slowly come to the realisation that the 'standard' of 6 foot and up is a bit inflated and I'd happily date a taller woman if anyone even cares for that. 😅 Then again I'm from Europe so it might be different here (my height is listed on my profile). 

I've made a Bumble and Tinder profile and I do get matches! Not a lot but I do get them from women whom I consider to be good-looking and interesting. 

Here's where my issues begin: I try to actively engage in a conversation, my openers are usually something related to the bio or matching music tastes for example, I do get answers but they're very dry - a simple ""yes hahaha"" or something like that. I feel like I have to completely guide the conversation if that makes sense? Most don't give me a rebuttal, it's like talking to a wall,  After a while I don't even bother anymore. Advice on this would be kind. 🙂.

Furthermore I know all about presenting yourself in a good way, groomed hair, beard, skin-care, cologne, yada yada, I have most of that down but clothing style? Yeah I don't know whats considered a good style  so tips on this would be godsend. But in general what is the 'oomph' concerning all of these points, if you peeps get what I'm saying?

Also it feels like something changed about him too. He doesn't want to break up at all, like if I bring it up he stubbornly wants to continue and talk about it, but he wants to meet less and less. At the beginning we spent weekends together and one day during the week and I also went to visit him at work once a week. Now he always says I can't see him at work because his boss is always there, often cancels dates during the week because he's ""busy"". Now we mostly meet only at weekends, though sometimes that becomes less as well, like one day instead of two.

I understand he's busy, but I work full time and study as well, so I'm busy too, yet still try to spend time with him much more than he does.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164809,public,self,Breaking up for no big reason?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tqchon/breaking_up_for_no_big_reason/,no_ads,0.0,,,

Hey everyone x I hope you are all well. 
I’ve been talking to someone online for the past month. He lives in Paris at the moment for work, while I live in the Middle East. He also comes from the Middle East, with his family being here. So he does frequent trips back. 

We had a connection right away! We would talk incessantly all day long and he finally came back home for a few days. We met the same night and our date went so well! He asked me to be his girlfriend, telling me that we would overcome the distance. I was a little hesitant at first but obliged because he treated me so well and told me how he was falling for me. 

He’s here for work, which requires a lot of time. He finishes up work by midnight on all days because it’s a whole event. We met last night for the second time at a hotel. We did the deed and cuddled. But he had a few questionable things that he did, that caused me a level of discomfort. 
1. Prior to meeting him, he told me one of his friends had access to his hotel room- so I asked him to take the key back because I wasn’t comfortable with someone having access to a room I was sleeping in. He started to yell at me stating that I trusted nobody and that I was judging that mans character. I yelled back and said it was nothing of that sort. He apologized a few minutes later. 
2. He told me he was still traumatized by his ex who broke his heart. 
3. I have the ick because he sits down and pees. It’s the worst to look at because he faces the toilet seat. 
4. He didn’t text me as much the next day because he was busy at work. Which I get, but I felt used because I had sex with him the night before? 

I just don’t know how to go about this. I could use some serious help. I don’t know what to do about him at all. Please help xx",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164808,public,self,Help!!

Myself and a longtime female friend of a similar age (mid 20s) took things to the next level after a night out about a month and a half ago, we've always kinda liked each other apparently but things just didn't line up until that night. Since we've had both had an amazing time getting to know each other on an intimate level. She was basically everything I wanted in a potential partner and I really cherished our friendship. 

Unfortunately the anniversary of a mutual best friends passing came around, and even in the week leading up to it she had been very distant with me.

We handle our emotions differently, but we're both very calm and collected. I knew it was upsetting so I've gave her time and been supporting her with dips in mood. However I felt like she was distancing herself from me by replying slower, the messages were less fulfilling, all flirting has ended and all intimacy dried up bar kissing. She only stayed over once since and that was due to her feeling so down (I didn't try start any funny business, I just held her) but other than that has no interest in seeing me often or staying like she did multiple times a week before.

Unfortunately this has been going on since then and honestly its got to the point I felt we needed to chat so I brought it up and she assured me she still wants to see where it goes, but she's just going through some things. I understood her completely but later she text me saying she wants to take a step back, take things slower and with less intensity if that's okay, but she'd understand if I didn't want that because she believes I deserve more than she can give. I asked her what the boundaries were and she was unable to tell me on the call, I didn't want to keep pushing it so I agreed we can see how it goes.

However, even since chatting it just feels like things are so different now. It genuinely feels like two good friends who kiss and rarely cuddle. I occasionally try and flirt and remind her I like her but any reciprocating is now dead in the water. It just feels like she doesn't actually want me despite claiming she wants to see where this goes. I want to support her but I'm the type of person who needs intimacy and to be showed they're actually wanted rather than feeling like I'm the only one arranging days out, or showing any kind of affection (although she'll still initiate kissing goodbye etc.)

I know yous won't be able to answer questions on her behalf but I want advice on how to handle this as I still cherish her and our friendship, and I honestly really like her and want this to work but I just don't feel like she feels the same despite saying she does. I usually distance myself in these types of situations by chatting with other girls until I know where things truely are, but I respect her too much to treat her like this and potentially hurt her.

I never subscribed to the Disney, man and wife, roses and petals stuff ever. When I was a kid I always thought dating was stupid—what can another person bring to your life that you can’t bring to yourself? Once I started dating some years ago, I still never felt like another person can bring more to my life than I can bring to myself, but that person becomes a mainstay in my life, a family member. I meet their family, they meet mine. We do stuff together all the time. Spend incredibly intimate sacred time with one another. I found it very special. It was something different  than my friendships, it satisfied many different needs and you have a fulfilling polarity with your s/o.

But when you lose somebody like that. Somebody you’ve been that intimately connected with, and not just them, but their family, their dog and cat, their younger sibling that treats you like their older brother and you teach them things, their younger cousin that loves a damn play fight even when you are trying to sleep, their mother who treats you like her own… how the fuck do you just instantly move on from that?

That shit is truly traumatic. It’s unnecessary, that type of pain is way too much. I still feel pain about the families of girls I’ve dated and how I don’t speak to them anymore.

I love really hard but I don’t let love blind me at all, when a breakup happens I hold my head high and let things be, but the pain that comes with it, the way it makes you cry at night, the way it makes you overthink… what’s the point? It just always ends in grotesque levels of pain.

And then when they move on with somebody else? Having all that special intimate time with somebody else?

Why the fuck should I or anyone put themselves through that? That is way too much.

I know I’m young, but the emotions of break ups are way too taxing on my soul. I prefer to be level headed at all times.

I know I care deeply about people, so why should I abuse that fact about myself?

What could I possibly gain from having a 2 year long intimate and special relationship with another human being and their families only for it to end every single time? And it’s not the fact that it ends that is the bad thing, it’s the amount of pain I feel.

My eyes have opened. My ex texted me recently and a week later she had a new bf but still wanted to communicate and leave “😍” emojis on my pictures. I blocked her on everything. The same pain came up from when we first broke up. The guy wrenching shit.

So I’ve had enough. I care about people a lot, I don’t want to lose that and become jaded from breakup after breakup. Enough man.

I’ve been like this for a while and it’s right and it works. I tell girls that I get into with that I don’t date. Most of the time they aren’t happy with that and end up moving on because of that, and I’m fine with things being that way. No unrelenting pain.

I just see relationships as a means to really fuck your psyche up and derail you from life and what’s important.

My problem is that I really want to be a dad, no, I have to be a dad. I want to raise children one day. I don’t know how I can do that without a woman I’m committed to though. I don’t want to do any type of separate householding or nothing. So I have no clue how I’m gonna do it if I never date.

Regardless, right now it’s better to not date. Too much unnecessary pain.

I really need some advice because I feel like I am going crazy. I really have no one to turn to and I would really appreciate some opinions on this. I want to try to make this as simple as I can and straight to the point without leaving too many details out. 

In February, this guy (John) and I decided to part ways. We were seeing each other for about a year and 3ish months. He basically didn't want to give me a title, didn't want to fully commit, cheated on me plenty of times and lied to me on many many occasions. At this point when things ended, I was very much mentally checked out and had been for months. I had given my all and my best to make it work and he simply did not care nor did he put in the effort, ever. It honestly felt like a waste of time. He never really expressed or showed TRUE DEEP feelings for me. He never posted me on socials, I met some of his friends but was never fully invited out. Hopefully this paints the picture. I have no idea why I stayed for so long but I regret it.

Before we broke up, around November, his best friend (Mark) and I started communicating and exchanging memes. It was completely harmless until it wasn't. Out of nowhere, we both started to develop serious feelings for each other. And I mean, SERIOUS feelings. We would talk on the phone 24/7, FaceTime, communicate on many social platforms. For a long time, I brushed them off and we never did anything with them because Mark and John have been best friends for literal years. I will say, I don't think I have ever felt what I felt/feel for Mark in a long, long time. 

Mark and I spent some time together in Feb. after things ended with John. Every time we saw each other, it was like this guy was completely in love with me. The connection and emotions, everything was there. He took me out to a fancy restaurant shortly after Valentine's Day and I spent that entire weekend with him. But every time after we saw each other, Mark would back off and feel guilty because of John. We would ultimately ""end things"" because of his guilt. Here he would go on his rants about how things could never work because of his friendship with John, his inability to want a relationship rn and all these other things.

Basically, Mark and I have gone back and forth between cutting communication, to communicating less, to starting it back up, to him backing down.... that's our cycle.

For instance, about 3 weeks ago, Mark invited me to his place. I went, I stayed over and within 4 days he was telling me it as a mistake and we couldn't continue. Here he told me he was going on a date with someone else and he will basically do this to rid himself of his guilt for liking me and see other people so he doesn't get fully attached and feel like a crappy friend. (He has told me this)He has always said he didn't want a relationship because he doesn't know what his future holds in terms of schooling and he likes the casual dating situation he was doing before me. Mark has expressed that he is able to casually date people because he feels no emotional tie to them. It's just physical. He has expressed that with me it is totally different because there are emotions involved. It also doesn't help that John and I once had a thing. So, we cut it off..... then last week somehow we get back into communication after a few days of no contact, its clear he missed me and just this past weekend I went over to his place, we had sex for the first time and I stayed over. Again, had a great time and it felt like we were together. He has expressed many many times how he enjoys spending time with me and how he's happy when I'm around. I know it's not about the sex because again, we just had sex for the first time this past weekend and before that, we hadn't and he still expressed such feelings.

John has now come back and told me that he is regretful and has given me the whole speech about how he misses me. I have no interest in ever dating him ever again and he's just being manipulative as always. I know for a fact that Mark has NOT and WILL NOT tell John about what has been going on. So I know it's just John trying to get some grip over me. 

If you made it this far.... thank you. My issues are as follows:

1. I need John to get over me. I do not want him expressing his feelings of regret to his friends, Mark specifically because it'll only push Mark away. 
2. I don't know what to do about Mark. I have very very VERY strong feelings for him, I know that he has strong feelings for me and that clearly shows because despite our back and forth and goodbyes, we always end up right back to where we are now. I don't want him going on dates with other people but I'm afraid if I go down with this conversation again, he will only freak out and leave again because he'll feel it's too much. 

The whole situation with Mark is very sensitive because he really does care about John despite all of this. I would be okay with us seeing each other in secret for a bit until John gets over me but I don't know how to have this conversation again with Mark. I'm just stuck. I don't want Mark leaving again and for us to go through that phase of not communicating or ending things just to end up doing it all over again. I get MASSIVE anxiety thinking about Mark going on dates with other people. I've tried to let this guy go but I genuinely can not and I have no idea why. I just know that if him and I were to have an actual fair shot together, it would work and he knows that too. But he gets in his head about his friendship with John and his future and then I'm the one who has to deal with him leaving and saying goodbye.... just for us to pick it back up. We both go back to each other no matter how hard we try not to.

I appreciate all of the advice and I'm sorry for rambling. I just hope this all makes sense to you all and can get some feedback because again, I am very very stuck.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164817,public,self,Need serious advice on my ex and his best friend.... caught in a serious pickle.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tqe66n/need_serious_advice_on_my_ex_and_his_best_friend/,no_ads,0.0,,,

I (m24) went on a date with this girl(f19) and went great to the point that she deleted tinder right after it
We kept messaging the following days and agreed on a second date, I asked if she wanted to go that same evening but she said she was tired

Yesterday after 2 days of not texting I contacted her and it was going great, we stopped talking and after a bit she messaged me but her vibe was off and told me that she was in a bad mood, I asked if her and her friends wanted to come eat with our groups (not as date more as way to try lifting her up) at first she seemed interested in coming but i feel like she got talked down by her friends. 

She then got mortified about saying no twice and started taking upon herself and I told her that it’s not a big deal because both times I asked on a short notice to which she said that I haven’t.

I’m a 34M and have been single since I broke up with my ex almost three years ago. I’ve hardly dated since then, since I needed time to get over the bad relationship, then several waves of the plague and me moving across the country I was finally ready to get dating again as the clock struck 2022. 

I came prepared to get back into the scene. I already know that I’m smart, funny, and have great fashion sense. I treated my male pattern baldness and my hair looks better than it has in years. My skin is better than ever too. I lost 25 pounds. I haven’t looked this good in about a decade. Heck, I’m 6’1 and have a conventionally respectable job. Im feeling confident.

I didn’t have any good photos for online dating so I worked on those. I invested in some basic phone photography equipment and got photos of me cooking and bicycling, wearing a suit, playing in the snow, and generally showing off my interests. I picked only the best and edited the photos in Lightroom to make them look great. 

When it came to writing a profile, I found examples of effective profiles for Match, the site I chose. I wrote my profile carefully, making sure that I was honest, interesting, and showing off my creative side. 

After several months on Match, I got one match my first day and nothing else. I’ve sent dozens of not hundreds of messages to women, all of which were written individually. I’ve gotten a lot of practice at messaging, but still no matches. So I went back to Coffee Meets Bagel where I’d had a lot of success in the past. Rinse, repeat: using improved photos and sending personalized messages, at least 10 per day. After over a week of this, bupkis. No matches. 

With all of these setbacks in online dating, I decided to be more outgoing in person. Thursday night I went to a local bar to watch a soccer game. I got talking to this beautiful, fun woman. We hit it off. I asked her out on the spot and she said yes! Finally, success! We exchanged numbers and she proceeds to ghost me. 

Yesterday I went to a local singles event that was a walking tour around one of my city’s art districts. They sold tickets to ten men and seven women. Not bad! Except only two women showed up and I was the youngest person there by at least eight years. 

I’m just so frustrated, confused, and lonely at this point that I’m getting depressed. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. My dating photos are getting poor scores on Photofeelr for attractiveness, is that just making me automatically rejected? I’m in Denver now and I know the dating scene for men is rough here, but is everybody looking for a mountain man here while I’m in town clean shaven and wearing a suit? Am I just the wrong type? Is there a trustworthy resource for me to figure out what I’m doing wrong? Is every other man having to put in this much work just for universal rejection? I’m just so exhausted of putting in work for nothing.

I’d really appreciate some perspectives on this issue. Both from girls and guys :)

I - a 30 year old male have been seeing a girl (also 30) for the past few months. We started off a bit quickly and saw each other almost every day. She recently got divorced (loveless marriage which she regretted from the start) and has been in relationships her whole life. 

The other day she told me she knew I wanted us to be exclusive/committed in a relationship but she wasn’t ready and wanted to be honest with me as she cares deeply - her words. She told me she isn’t ready to make anything official or be exclusive but wants to keep it going to see how things pan out and work out if we’re an ideal match. Her reasoning? Her previous marriage which she rushed into and has since regretted. 

I care a lot for her and her daughter but I’m at pains as to what to do. It feels like we are in a relationship bar making it official but she told me she still wants to experience single life (for the first time). I agreed to be patient and proceed but it’s difficult knowing she is flirting/messaging other guys who are all obsessed with her. She is very attractive and she knows it. She hasn’t gone on any dates with others (yet) but it feels this may happen sooner rather than later and being brutally honest here, makes me feel anxious and insecure. I understand she’s trying to see what she wants and doesn’t wish to make a similar mistake as she did with her ex husband but to see her messaging other guys hurts and makes me feel nauseous. 

Up until this point my anxiety/vulnerability has been showing and perhaps an element of neediness - traits I do not wish to possess nor exhibit. My question here is - do I stick it out, play it cool and give space and take a backseat for her to do more of the leg work (and be less available/emotionally invested - I know she likes to chase) or do I bite the bullet and call it off? I almost tried calling it off the other day and gave her an ultimatum and she told me she understood why but I wasn’t strong enough and agreed to be patient. Anyway that’s where her emotions currently are right now. 

It’s a shame that we connected at a point when she just got out of her marriage but we knew each other before (friends of friends) and things just happened so quickly after we met on holiday. I do regret rushing it as I am very invested now so would be eternally grateful for your take on the matter.

Almost all were first dates going nowhere.

I get a match. I do some ice breaking witty chit chat. I ask her out on a date. I use both Hinge and Bumble.

On the first date I greet her with a gentle hug. I buy her coffee, and we typically sit outside or go down to a park.

I then just talk with her normally trying to get to know her finding some common ground / laughter. I like hearing people talk about themselves, and I usually share stories of the hilarious things kids do at my work (I work at a public school).

Sometimes I'll talk a bit about grad school / my hobby of mountain bike riding / somewhere I recently visited. But usually I just try to let the conversation drive itself. Best convos take us both along for the ride. I try to let my date do most of the talking if I could.

If she has a bracelet on, I'll compliment her bracelet and gently grab her hand to have a closer look (Or if her nails or done / she has a tattoo / whatever). Just a few seconds of skin contact.

Then upon leaving I read her body language, and 99 percent of the time she just hugs with her head turned.

Then I text ""hope you made it home okay. It was nice getting to know you more today.""

Then the following day I ask her out on a 2nd date, and then I get the ""no connection, nothing in common, no chemistry,"" abstract rejection message.

And I scratch my head like WTF am I doing wrong? This sounds incel, but sometimes I really do wonder if I'm just an ugly guy. I workout a lot and dress nicely. I swear I've been on first dates that were dead from the first minute.

I sometimes just rack my brain how come I'm just very unsuccessful with it all. Sometimes I'll date someone for a couple of weeks, and even that fizzles off very quickly.

What are your thoughts? I sometimes think:

Maybe I'm too nice? In the rejection message they always say ""It was nice meeting you, or you're a nice guy.""

Sometimes I think I have a weird nervous energy that's off putting. Or maybe I'm coming off as way too platonic. I just don't know.

Also, she asked me if I want to go with her on a club event but the tickets were already sold so I couldn't find any and I told her that next time I would go with her.

Hi there M(17). I have known this girl for about 5-6 years. She is 17 also. Over over the last couple of weeks there have been things that she has been doing differently which makes me believe that maybe she may want to be more than friends. Out of all the guys at work and in our classes I would be the main one she talks to or at least feels comfortable talking too.

This is what I have noticed.

1. She asked me if I was going to homecoming and if so if I was going with anyone.
2. When around me at work she becomes way more social than what she normally is with other workpeople.
3. She changes the tone and pitch in her voice when around me.
4. She makes a effort to try to continue the conversation after she gets interrupted by something. This was evident today as she was wanting me to talk about everything that was in my head to be honest.
5. She kind of changes her tone in her voice when she speaks with me
6. At work she makes a effort in being near me and chatting to me while walking with me around the store helping out and trying to make it last as long as possible.
7. I catch her glancing and looking at me from either across the store and the class.
8. She waits behind for me at the end of work and and will sit near me at break in the staff room.

I (37, F) just got out of a five year relationship. I broke it off because of my partner's alcoholism and we had both stopped putting effort into our relationship and were both dealing with varying degrees of depression. I would have been open to working things out, but it just felt impossible to even get to a place to work on the relationship while addiction was in the way. I didn't want to live in limbo and uncertainty anymore. After the latest series of incidents I had known for about 1-2 months the breakup was coming. Is that why I don't feel sad???

My question is how long should I abstain from dating? Curiosity about the dating scene (at my now older age) got the better of me, and I swiped around a bit on one of the apps. I ended up matching with a number of people and one of them I was excited about meeting. We had made plans to meet, but I started having second thoughts so I told him I needed more time. He was super cool about it and we agreed I'd reach out when I was ready to get to know each other. 

The reason for the second thoughts is because a) what if I end up liking this first guy; I don't want to jump immediately back into something serious and b) I need to work on my depression. The last time I was single I stayed so for about 9 months and started casually dating on the apps immediately. To me, it was a lot of fun. The thing I need to work on is I seem to have a pattern of becoming depressed after entering a new relationship. I can elaborate more on why in comments if anyone is interested. And that snowballs into me not maintaining friendships, self care, etc.

But at the same time I'm curious about this guy... Is it possible to meet people while actively working on yourself?

Maybe it’s my fault for thinking something like that was true, but I felt the same way, we had so much in common, she was so understanding and completely understood me and was accepting when I told her my biggest mistakes and I thought this could really go somewhere.

Her dad cheated on her mom, and her ex cheated on her, so I understand her trust issues, I’ve been cheated on so I understood. 

Before her my first big ex left me whenever she wanted and came back whenever and I always stayed, I developed a habit over the course of 3 years to check my story to see if she checked it. I know that may sound dumb but I have no desire to talk to her or get back together, it’s just like a habit. I wish I didn’t check my exes social media because I have no desire to talk or be with them. It’s just one of those things and i get that sounds dumb, but I don’t cheat and I’m 100 a loyal person, sometimes I’m just interested in those persons lives because of the time we spent together and shit. As dumb as that sounds.

Anyways she brought up how I kept looking at my stories like I was looking for someone, wish is somewhat true but not for the reason she thought, also sometimes my old friends see it and it bothers and I’ve always genuinely checked who looks at it.

So we get into a mini argument and our anxiety goes really bad, but we work through and she says all these amazing things, because I have bad anxiety and ocd and she really eased my mind and let me know things were okay.

I thought she’d appreciate the honesty by me saying today my most recent ex, kept looking at my stories, and that I kind of felt bad because even though we broke up in December we always remained friends, so I felt a tad bit remorseful blocking her on Snapchat and so on, because I have no desire to talk to her or anyone because I thought I was with my dream girl 

She took that as you still like your ex and you’re wasting my time, it’s like everything she’s ever said and everything we’ve done, gone an instant. I’m so broken and I have no tears left to cry. I don’t know how I’m gonna make it through the week. She was so sweet to me and made me feel beautiful. She always complemented me and treated me better than anyone my entire life. But it’s all gone.

I know it’s partially my fault and I’m trying to get better at those bad habits, oddly enough I can’t help to stop least smile knowing she threw everything away over something I was never gonna do. 

But I think I won’t be able to date for a long time, my trust is completely gone. I don’t ever wanna feel like this. I hate feeling like

Hello, sorry for the English, not from the US.

I(25M) have know this girl (29F) for more than 5 years, we've always been close friends ( for the most part) , we went with no contact for more than 2 years. I have always liked her but I chickened out, I never asked her out because she was in a relationship, 3 years ago when she broker up with her boyfriend I felt that she liked me and wouldn't say no if I were to ask her out. an example of this is that she started calling me love, baby etc .. Also one thing that stayed on my mind is one day she wanted to have a coffee with me and when I said I can't , she told me "" if you really care about someone you will create time to meet them"" is this a hint or am I tripping?

Anyways, she broke up with her 2 years boyfriend ( was a very toxic relationship ) and I think she is depressed right now, Should I ask her out or am I already in the friend zone? Also seeing as she is depressed she might say no even if she wanted and I really do not want to lose her as a friend as it will be awkward if she only sees me as a friend, what is your opinion?

First I want to say that I have tried searching though the web in order to find a similar situation like mine, and I am sure that there is a bunch of example to take inspiration from. However, I felt that non of the stories that I have read really matches how I properly feel so I had to write my thoughts down. Also I think that I and my girlfriend have something special and the whole write reflect-and-conclude process really helps me see clearer. 

As some of you have already notices I am a very rational person, for the better and for worst. I have been very reluctant about writing a post like this but I feel that it is necessary. Ok, so enough about me. Here we go.

I met this girl on Tinder almost 6 months ago. She is soon to be 30 years old and I am almost 29. The first date was not very impressive, more like a “ouch I will not here from her again” kind-of-date. Despite all odds she was quite eager to see me again and we just kept dating. Ever since we have been just casually dating, meeting up 1-2 times a week which allow both of us to do our regular stuff. I guess that I have benefited more with this slow approach (and frankly also needed the time and space) in order to make things works between us. It has been a long time since I was in a serious relationship, and I really enjoy my own time. I am quite busy with work, part-time studies, currently a language course, some sports and hanging out with my friends. I am also quite busy with visiting my mom which runs a farm a few hours away from where I live. It happens quite often that I need to see her to help her out with some stuff. The reason for this is that my father passed away quite some time ago, and my help has been more or less essential to run the farm without having to pay a fortune every time something small breaks or just basic work performed using a tractor. 

Anyway, back to me and my girlfriend. The chemistry between us is great. I would say that we match at an intellectual level, we talk almost equally much, and we area very often finding ourselves laughing at some stupid thing that either she or I have said or done. The communication flow between us is great, except when serious things, such as issues that could threaten our relation comes up. An issue that has been discussed is the fact that in the long run we want to live in two separate cities each on the other side of the country I live in. The distance is not enormous (I believe that a lot of people somehow make it work) but I see that this could become a problem familywise after some time. Another thing that I have not mentioned to her, but I want to mention is the fact that we are also quite different. I would like to live on a small/medium farm when I get older, and she doesn’t. I need space and closeness to nature, and she adores the city life, shopping and going to coffee shops. She is optimistic, I am a bit pessimistic. She wants to travel to big cities in the weekends and I want to go backpacking before I get too old and used to being comfortable. For instance, I believe that my girlfriend has already entered this level of comfort in her daily life. Perhaps this is a small derailment, but she is also pushing for buying a new apartment soon, as I have no desire to lock my money into an apartment yet. This whole concept of her mentioning this is freaking me out. 

To better understand the situation, I think that it is necessary to go deeper into our personalities. I would define her as a very open, understandable person who fires compliments to all persons she meets (at least me) and she needs (and deserves) positivity in her life. Me on the other hand is very realistic by nature, using few words describing myself and sometimes having a hard time expressing my own feelings. Since I am not good with these things, I have a tendency to retreat to my own space whenever things get serious. Sometimes I feel relieved that I have work to do, so that I can perform a raincheck on any of our plans. To add to the list of obvious things, I believe that I have a strong case of commitment issues. Also, I am not good with complimenting others, and giving her compliments is not an exception. It is not that I don’t want to, but it doesn’t come natural to me. She is always telling me that she is looking forward to seeing me and that she enjoyed every minute spent with each other, she calls me handsome etc. I also notice that she is trying to test me by asking me if I still have a crush on her, as I will only make a joke to avoid the seriousness of the question and to avoid telling her how I feel. This makes me very uncomfortable, but she should feel the same for having to ask these things too, I guess. 

First I want to say that I have tried searching though the web in order to find a similar situation like mine, and I am sure that there is a bunch of example to take inspiration from. However, I felt that non of the stories that I have read really matches how I propetrly feel so I had to write my thoughts down. Also I think that I and my girlfriend have something special and the whole write reflect-and-conclude process really helps me see clearer. ove myself by learning new things, staying fit, and meeting new people. I think that I am on the right path for finding people that I want in my life, but I am not sure if I want to settle for the normative life just yet. I am afraid to commit to a relationship just because it is expected from me, and that I overlook my own needs, feelings and goals. I have been using a lot of time finding myself, knowing what I like to do and what my cornerstones in life should be. Now I am afraid to compromise one or several of these to “give in” for love. Now I feel that I have meet the ideal wife really, being smart, attractive and funny, but I just feel the timing is all wrong. 

I am afraid that I will never be able to say that I love her in a way that she wants, and in a way that I actually mean it. This could because I truly don’t love her, but that I am being afraid of the feeling of being alone. Or it could be that I have not felt “true” love before and that I cannot tell if I am experiencing it or not. I mean I have felt that I have been close to some degree of love before, but never experiencing the real deal as some very assertive people describe it as. My gut says that I need to be open with her about these feelings, to the extent that I will risk losing her. Again, I am afraid that if I am losing her I will notice that I took one of my greatest loves for grated and that a bridge has been burned down for good and for all. On the other hand, I am afraid that she will accept a lot of my bullshit, move to my hometown, that we were not meant to be and that we become misery and have wasted each other’s time. 

Am I only seeing this potentially great relationship with dark colors or am I on to something here? I would love for any constructive input from people being or have been in a similar situation. I also hope that I have not picture myself as totally inconsiderate, cold, and a selfish person. I must add that I have been loyal to her the whole time, and that I have never intentionally considered doing anything to hurt her the slightest. The only doubt and pain that I might put her through is due to the fact that I am becoming more true and generally open to her, just being the person that I truly am. The reason that I ask you is to better know if she is better off without me or if she deserves the chance from me and that I have to put my own goals and expectations aside.

“Do you want to have a 3some with me and my boyfriend”

……….”Parden?”

“Yea”

And obviously I’m like ok scam this isn’t real. But we were talking normally before and usually scammers go straight to sexual and send me money.

We talk some more she says add her bf he’ll send some videos (sketch). They’re legit….it’s real…I could fuck this hot girl on the regular and her bf would be there but I’m sitting here horny and that isn’t sounding like a problem. The only problem I’m seeing is my personal life. Me and the guy talk (both of them were actually super nice and patient which I thanked them for, not pushy AT ALL) I’d ask “should I really consider this” and they’d be like “it’s up to you no worries”. Eventually I was like I’m gonna have to call it a no. Thanked them both for being so nice and told them good luck. (Genuinely they were so sweet)

To start everything off, she had very rough experiences with boys and relationships in general in the past.

The school year is coming to an end and I most likely will go to a different school than her (Well I can choose, I'm in the position that I have the ability to do so, but education is numero uno). Now, the thought of her rejecting me is almost gone from my head, I'm pretty sure she likes me but I don't give a damn. What matters is that I care for her, I don't want her to feel bad if we have to split up if the relationship doesn't work cause of the different schools. I honestly don't know what her reaction to a break up would be. Even if she doesn't react to it, what was the point if we just get into a relationship and months later we break up, not because it didn't work out, just because of an inability in contact.

I was introduced to a girl by a friend (let's call her Ann) of mine when we were at in a pub. I've noticed that she has asked me a shit ton of questions. So many of them, that I rarely had the opportunity to ask her back. Also, when we were sitting at a table she would suddenly ask me personal questions and ignore my friend's presence. 

Two days later, the 3 of us met again in a park. While talking she suggested going on a trip to Italy together which is kind of surprising because we only have been knowing each other for literally 2 days! She reasoned it by saying that I was a friend of Ann, so I must be a good person. Also when we were walking together, she asked me personal questions like 'Do you play an instrument?' etc and completely ignored Ann. I find it weird because if you would talk as a group you would ask questions that everyone in the group can or should answer... 

Today, I asked her if she was free today and if she wanted to something with me outside. She said that she is busy but invited me having lunch with her. So, I agreed and had lunch with her. I gotta mention that we had lunch for only about 30-45 minutes (because she had to go to work afterwards) and there she also started asking me personal questions again.

I just can't tell if she is into me or not. 

I really do like her. We have so many things in common and also think in the same way. She is the kindest person I have ever met in my life and I always start smiling when she nice to other people. 

All 3 of us vibe together really well. I really would love to get to know her more and take her on a date but a few months ago I did have a bad experience by asking a friend out which lead to losing contact with her. That's why I said to myself that I will never ever ask out a friend again... 

I just don't know what to do right now... How can I tell if she is interested or not?

After the end of my last relationship I put a lot of much needed effort into myself; I lost weight, started to dress better, started to live a more active lifestyle, and invested much needed time into my hobbies.  

I took about a year off from dating to work on myself and because of COVID (i.e., I didn't feel comfortable meeting up with random people just yet).  I have been going on dates again since late August 2021.  

Since then I have been on dates with 8 different girls:

* 3 were just one dates that I was either not into or indifferent with and didn't proceed with after the date
* 2 were girls I went on 2-3 dates with who I was into but got hit with a ""I don't think this is going to work text"" afterward the 2nd or 3rd date
* 1 girl I went on 2-3 dates with but I ended as there were too many red flags
* 1 girl who invited me over to ""watch a movie"" and set up a formal date afterwards but she ghosted me
* The last was a 2 month long situationship which I thought was going to go ""official"" until I realized she was lying about being exclusive and she is now dating the ""guy she told you not to worry about"" so to speak.  

A majority of these have been from dating apps; I get a ""decent"" amount of matches (I'm not a male model by anymeans but I realize that I am ""a type"" to some girls) but often times will not get a response when I message someone (which is normal IMO).  

It is all starting to get a little tiring?  I feel like a lot of other people I know seem to have a lot better luck with dating than I do.  

I guess I just need some advice/words of encouragement?  I have been setting a goal to go on a ""date per month"" just to get myself out there and meet new people.

And that I am also sorry for the incoming word vomit. 

I dated this guy when I was 17-18, a senior in high school (he was a freshman in college). It became much more serious much faster than I expected, but I jumped into the commitment. We were young, doing long distance part of the time, and absolutely infatuated with each other. I developed deep love and care for him and always wanted it to be him that I ended up with. He always reciprocated that to me, and we talked about our future plans often. Our families and friends all truly believed we would end up marrying one another. 

My first month of college freshman year (his sophomore year), our communication was a struggle. I was adjusting to a new schedule and a new life, and balancing that with the relationship was difficult. We ended up parting ways that same month and although I saw it coming, it did devastate me. He initiated the breakup call, and I really just said “okay, friends it is.” For the next 3 years, we’d do our own thing and never reach out to one another—we’d occasionally see each other at mutual events at home, but generally avoided speaking or being near one another because it felt as if I didn’t know how to address him. 

Fast forward to my senior year of college—he is graduated and working a full time job in his college town. In the fall, I begin thinking of him again + start to consider just reaching out to see how he is and how his life is (we’d been broken up for 3-ish years at this point). In a series of serendipitous events, I run into his mom when I’m home one weekend and she tells me what he’s been doing. I took that as a sign to reach out and texted him—we had a great conversation going and it was clear we have both grown up quite a bit. Suddenly, mid-conversation, he stops responding. My first thought is that “okay, he must not want to talk to me. I’ll leave it be and not push.”

I’d go on to wish him a Happy Thanksgiving and he wished it back. We left it at that. We didn’t speak again after that until this week.

Last weekend, we saw each other at a mutual event at home but again, didn’t speak or acknowledge one another. Based on conversations with friends who were also there, it was pretty obvious that the both of us were looking at one another throughout the event and trying to stay out of each other’s way. I spoke to many of his family members there who recognized and stopped me to say hello. 

After seeing him but not speaking, I said “I guess we’ll never speak again” and went on about my week…until my birthday. He texted me a happy birthday message (the first birthday message he’s sent me since we dated years ago). I asked him how he was and we started up a conversation about our work and about the event we were both at as if we talked regularly. I realized that I felt truly happy to be talking to him, and have missed having him in my life all this time. He was bringing up new things to talk about, responding to my messages fully, and it was great…until he just out of the blue didn’t respond anymore mid-conversation. 

I am now feeling a couple of things: 

1) I’d still really like to get to know him again, and I enjoy sharing conversation with him.  
2) Wondering if it’s something I say or do that makes him stop responding…I thought it was a fluke the first time but now I don’t know.

It might be worth noting that neither of us have seriously been with anyone else since our relationship—I had a failed talking stage and I think he may have been on one date…but we’ve both remained single. 

If you’ve made it to the end of my word vomit, thank you for even taking the time to read it. 

In summary: I am starting to feel a little butterfly of feelings and curiosity again but I don’t know how I would even approach it if this weird stopping mid-conversation thing keeps persisting.

I'm looking for someone who doesnt approach conflicts with assumptions and sticks to them.I want  someone who goes into the conversation about conflicts with questions and trying to find a solution on how to prevent it it from happening again. Someone who is willing to hear and think about both sides.Not with the objective of an opology, an assumption and getting overtly angry( of course there situations that do merit the aforementioned traits). Now I'm not saying I won't apologize, I want to but going in demanding an apology every time, over little things isn't something I do when I feel like my partner caused a conflict. Also I want the person to have the emotional maturity to have the conversation in person or over the phone, not text if we can't talk at that moment.

Someone who is very self aware of what they are doing and doesn't have double standards.

Someone who doesnt excpect me to plan the dates almost all the time.

Someone who wants to go out on dates at least once a week and likes going places almost all the time, not a homebody.

Someone who doesnt think the world of themselves, is talking about how great they are, even saying ""I'm an amazing person""once is such a turn off for me.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164842,public,self,"Are these unrealistic standards, especially all of them together?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tqke8p/are_these_unrealistic_standards_especially_all_of/,no_ads,0.0,,,
