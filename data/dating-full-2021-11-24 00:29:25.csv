I made new friends in here. Some of my female friends proposed me and i rejected them saying i dont feel for you like that way then they badly wanted to know why am I still single and why don't i have anybody in my life.

I had to tell them the truth and everything. Thought I'll get their sympathy now and they won't talk about these things.

It all started in sophomore year of high school, she was the new kid in school and barely knew anyone. We never talked to each other, but we did have a class together. The reason why we started talking is she became friends with another girl I was friends with. The three of us went out for a small birthday celebration, that‚Äôs when we started talking more. 

Nothing really changed between us until halfway through senior year of high school. 

I came back to my school after leaving for that semester to take college courses and online high school classes. She was excited I came back, including a lot of other her and my friends. I got back on the school tennis team and started practicing again with my old teammates that didn‚Äôt graduate last year. I jokingly asked her to join the team and she said she would join with me. At the time, nothing really seemed special between me and her so I never really thought of us being in a ‚Äúrelationship.‚Äù When she joined and we started hanging out more, I started to like her more. We would always practice tennis outside of school every week and just have fun. After awhile, we started going to activities together and going to restaurants. 

This is where the story takes a turn.

After graduation, we had a lot of free time. Every week I went to her house and watched her favorite movies and shows. The first couple weeks were just me and her sitting there watching the tv and us talking. After a while, she started laying on me and touching me; which caught me off guard. Probably a month in, she was literally on me and and rapping her arms around my body. At one point, she literally grabbed my hand and put it on her ass. That night of the ass touching, we both went outside so she could say bye to me when I was leaving, and we did a 30-60 second tight hug, which was kinda awkward since I‚Äôm quite a bit taller than her. She also brought me around her family and her mom and dad loved me. Her dog also LOVED me, it was hilarious. She‚Äôs also in pageants and won the city last year and she was competing for state queen. I promised that I would go but something came up and it made it where I couldn‚Äôt see her preform. So I got her a small gift for what she did, and it was a cameo of one of her favorite actress‚Äôs congratulating her on what she did. When she saw it, she almost cried. 

After the gift, was when I gained up the courage to tell her my feelings. She did say that she cared also but since we were going to colleges that are pretty far apart from each other. Which I understood, I was in a long distance relationship at one point and it fell apart. So do you guys think I still have a chance or was she playing me in some small way? The thing that stings about it if she was playing me is that she seemed like the one. Whenever I tried to talk to other girls after her, I would grow disinterested with any other girl because they weren‚Äôt her. She was the perfect girl I was looking for; funny, smart; likes to play video games, same religious standpoint, and same political views. I know this is surface level but she is beautiful and she would always complain about her ‚Äúassets‚Äù but I thought her body was perfect the way it was.

I have been trying to find a girlfriend for a good two years. But I hardly get any likes on platforms like Tinder and Bumble. Most of my dates end with ""the evening with you was nice, but the spark is not there"". I'm at a loss by now. All I want for christmas is ... a girlfriend. 

I can't think of anything else that I could do. I have optimized my photos and even paid for Tinder Premium. Neither has brought much improvement. I don't know what I'm doing wrong with the meetings. I've tried asking the women for feedback, but have never gotten a useful and honest answer. 

Things are no better in real life. My circle of friends and my job in the tech industry are dominated by men. So I signed up for bouldering. But most of the women are already taken. 

I don't understand why I have such a hard time finding a partner. 

I'm certainly not a handsome man, I had to learn that the hard way on Tinder. I've tried chadfishing. Suddenly I had more than enough matches and the women wouldn't have been averse to a first date at their house. While I always have to keep the chat alive with questions and come up with a creative date idea. 

On the other hand, I am not ugly, I would rate myself as mediocre. In any case, not worse than all the men who stroll happily with their girlfriend over the Christmas market. In addition, I am interested in many things, according to my degree  not completely stupid and earn quite well. But all that doesn't seem to be enough for women nowadays. No woman has shown interest in me yet. Although my standards are not high. I don't want a model, just an intelligent and slightly nerdy woman who feels like going to the theater with me, cooking and watching Netflix.

Do you have any more ideas to make my dream come true? Or is anyone in the same situation?

The girl I wanted to ask out is my brothers girlfriends sister in july. We didnt really interact until around a month ago. We spent the weekend at there house sense my parents went out for the weekend, we all ended up going to a amusement park,and we ended up splitting up and i thought we had a good time. Then last week we all went to the boardwalk at the beach (4 of us plus another couple) and We spent like 3.5 hours together, shopping and playing minigolf. I had a good time and I thought she did too. I was advised to ask my brother about it

Now onto the update:

I told my brother about it and he said no. When I asked why he said that wouldn't work out. Thats all he said, and that was the end of the duscussion.

So yeah thats not gonna happen.

So I‚Äôve been on a few dating apps for maybe 4 months now, at least consistently. It‚Äôs done a number on me mentally because I‚Äôve had probably 4 matches in that time, 1 was a past fling that went nowhere and only 1 of the other 3 even responded. Some of this I attest to the fact that I‚Äôm just not great looking, about average at best. But I feel there‚Äôs also something to be said about my account not being a great representation of me.

So I guess my question is simply, how do you take good pictures of yourself?

He mentions how much he likes spending time with me but part of me is also hurt that he does not see the possibility of a relationship with me. Is this normal? Do any of you take awhile to enter a relationship or are you pretty decisive early on. I realize a lot of this indecisiveness is also on my end but if I felt that he wanted a relationship i might be more open. I guess a lot of my own indecisiveness is due to insecurity and inexperience.

Then she had a problem with her family making our relationship sour. I tried my best to cheer her up and be there for her like I did back when we we're best friends but it didn't work. Things go sour between us, we cooled off just a bit but after a week we got back together again. 

Things we're back as it used to be but I felt like something's not right. She won't talk to me that much anymore, she's busy playing games. I thought that this is her way of coping so I supported her and gave her space because I thought she would need time for herself and only she can solve her problems and that I was only there to be by her side and support her. 

One day I was playing resident evil village when she texted me that she wanted to be best friends again, that she wanted for us to break up. I talked to her that it's just probably a heat of the moment type of thing that we can maybe get through this together but she insisted that she didn't want me to be hurt anymore. At the end I go with her decision and we broke up. 

It's been a few months now, I'm starting to feel better. But I'm still stuck at the thought that what if I could've done better, what if I was more capable, what if I didn't confessed that I have feelings with my best friend, what if I just suppressed these feelings and eventually forget it. I miss the closeness we had back then

We didn't go back as being best friends just like she said. We're just strangers now. It's fine by me at least I know that she's kinda happy now, she found new friends, a new way to cope and all of that stuff.

I (24 M) have been going out with some women for the last two or three months, and it‚Äôs been awesome.
But the idea of going for the kiss actually scares me a little, not because I haven‚Äôt done it before (I‚Äôve kissed a lot of women, and I‚Äôve had a very sexual period in my college years) but this is the first time on my life that I‚Äôm only going out with women I really find attractive both physically and mentally, normally I played it safe and just went for whoever gave me attention regardless of me reciprocating, after a lot of therapy I decided not to do this because it‚Äôs not fair for all of these women, I won‚Äôt be able to fully reciprocate their feelings towards me, and it‚Äôs not fair for me because I‚Äôm not respecting my self worth, and I ended up feeling empty and broken after this.
Normally what worked for me was verbally asking if I could kiss her, but I don‚Äôt feel that goes with the proactive, risk taking man I want to be.
Even if this gives me the chills I really want to do it.
Confidence it‚Äôs not actually the problem because I see myself as a good looking, smart, good hearted successful man, I take care of my health and image and I‚Äôm proud of my achievements.
So, my question here is how do I go for the kiss while also being respectful and prioritizing consent, but also not asking for it verbally, and how do I know if the moment is right?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1129159,public,self,Help!

When I finally got over that, I tried dating again, but it was really hard to find someone I was compatible with who I could connect to on the same level. So i took a break from dating.

Well now I'm 26 and I just moved into my own place, and I want to start dating again, but the truth is I'm scared.

It was easier for me to get into a relationship before in high school and college simply because you could meet people easily through class or extracurriculars. 

However here in the real world, I'm constantly scared of coming off as a creep if I start a conversation with anyone. So I just don't. It doesn't help I'm constantly being pressured into blind dates, which you think would help, but it honestly makes me more anxious.

So I didn't say anything and tried to continue as nothing had happened. 

It was a bit awkward after that. I didn't say much and was a bit short. She seemed a bit flustered too. After another week passed, things eased, and we started to speak/text again. It was strictly business, only to talk about the lab report. When she talked to me about the reports, though, she constantly thanked me and used my name. I think it's cute how she uses my name so often; I try to use hers often as well. Also, she will send me smilely faces with her messages too. I have only seen her once without a mask, and she did smile at me then too. 

Once, when I asked her a question not wholly related to the lab, she quickly messaged me, ‚Äúthat now is not a good time. Ask me another time, for sure.‚Äù

This is her first semester in a Ph.D. program. She has mentioned that she is very busy and that her schedule is crazy. She typically would tell me this when she couldn't get enough work done for the lab reports or work last minute. I had to pick up the slack a few times for her, which bothered me a bit, but I bit the bullet. I did mention to her that my schedule is also busy. However, generally, she has done great work, and we will both end up with a good grade. She carried us a few times, and I did too. 

I can be pretty intense when it comes to doing laboratory. I'm not afraid to be critical of other people's work. I was critical of my lab partner's work, and I can tell it occasionally rubbed her the wrong way. She would still accept my criticisms, and I would take hers. When things looked good, we would complement each other too.

I typically over-communicate. I have sent her many messages about the lab. She sent me a lot less. Sometimes I think she is just putting up with me and being kind üôÉ. My confidence has not been high lately, and I‚Äôm sure she has noticed that in my interactions with her.

My time with my lab partner is coming to a close, and I find myself wondering

Should I try asking her again? I feel like she has sent me signals all semester long.

Tonight I met a guy that was just a straight up dick but thought he was like funny doing it. Anyway. He kept bashing on me for whatever reason and was really getting under my skin. But I kept being nice to him and teasing him back in non insulting ways (which is a skill in its own right let‚Äôs be honest). What really turned me onto him was how stubborn he was. He was so fucking stubborn. So steadfast in his ways. And that‚Äôs so hot to me because I haven‚Äôt managed to hang onto many beliefs long term and am constantly redefining life as the open minded person I am. 

So I kept being nice to him. And I asked him about himself and his life and his family. And he answered every question I asked. 
And he stopped being a dick. And I melted his little arrogant stubbornness and got him to open up about why he was so angry. I got him to laugh. And man did he have a beautiful smile. 

Then everyone was making jokes about us and how we were ‚Äúgonna go make out‚Äù or ‚Äúlovebirds.‚Äù And that‚Äôs how you kind of know it‚Äôs not just in your head right? When other people notice and call it out? Idk

Towards the end of the night he was just a ball of mush. He told me about how he got rejected from the schools he wanted to go to and was really lonely at this school. He really softened up and even apologized for being so rude at first. 

But it‚Äôs probably not going to work out with this kid. It never does for me. I mean I told this kid I was sort of seeing someone which is an exaggeration at best but not an outright lie. I don‚Äôt know why I said that but it was probably because I‚Äôm insecure and was scared if he thought even for a second that I liked him that he would reject me immediately.

It‚Äôs currently 5am the day after a first date and I can‚Äôt seem to stop thinking about this one thing.

Little context, I‚Äôm 19M kissless virgin but have no problem getting dates or attracting girls, the issue starts with the type of girls I get attracted to. They usually end of being really distant and have bad communication, always have some kind of family/mental health problem. I‚Äôm a very logical thinking guy so when I see this I know I shouldn‚Äôt be pursuing further but I still end up having feelings afterwards. Last girl I was actually interested in told me she ends up hurting people so we decided to be friends since this is what we started as. 

Went on a date yesterday, she‚Äôs great but not my type and at the end I knew she wanted me to kiss her but I couldn‚Äôt, even though she‚Äôs attractive and I could at least get some experience I still didn‚Äôt have the urge. 

I really hope it‚Äôs just me not having met the right person yet because if it‚Äôs just the classic ‚ÄúI want what I can‚Äôt have‚Äù scenario, then oh boy am I gonna have a rough time. I‚Äôm getting really tired of this. Finding a girl I like, turns out she‚Äôs bad‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs pretty demotivating.

So now my question to you is, should I be working on my self more before trying to find a relationship?

Meeting people IRL is hard after being in online school. 

I have decided to delete all my dating apps. Because nothing positive comes out of it for me. I only used them when I felt lonely. 

So now I‚Äôm slowly attempting to meet people IRL, I‚Äôm going to a community collage at the moment, my first semester classes didn‚Äôt really have any possibilities. Hopefully next semester will. People seem to just keep to them selves. As do I, but it makes it 10X harder to start a conversation.

Plus I‚Äôm more mature for me age (I know I probably still sound like a child to some of you, but I have always gotten long with people older then me) so the people in my classes don‚Äôt really have the motivation and values as I have. Finding someone‚Äôs who‚Äôs older in typically freshman level classes is going to be difficult.

On me being shy, normally I become bold, outgoing and funny once I get know someone. But I have some deep routed insecurities. Most of my life I have had a speech impediment, I spent 12 of my 19 years working through it. I have ‚Äúgraduated‚Äù from speech therapy, and I have clear speech (according to the people I tell) I‚Äôm trained to here even the smallest mess up in my pronunciation of a word, I also stutter when I‚Äôm nervous, which is a lot when taking to new people. So I tend to keep quite and not strike up conversations. So lots of missed possibilities 

One more thing is that I have a medical condition where a benign tumor has ate away part of my jaw 
So I have an asymmetrical face, it‚Äôs not horrible, but it‚Äôs noticeable enough for me to be called a ‚Äúsquash‚Äù (Iv learned to laugh at it , it‚Äôs a stupid joke though)
Despite that I still think I‚Äôm decently attractive.

Wearing masks have been away for time to hide and feel more confident. But I feel ashamed when people look at me or of I get a ‚Äúchecking you out ‚Äú I feel like they would be disappointed if I were to take off my mask .

Overall, all that has made me hand my head down, and avoid eye contact, so I‚Äôm hesitant when entering the dating world.

So any advice on getting the courage to  attempting to strike up a conversation irl, and trying to seem like a person who wants to be approached",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1129180,public,self,Dating when shy and during an pandemic,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r0wjup/dating_when_shy_and_during_an_pandemic/,no_ads,0.0,dating,,,

A little bit of contexts: 

* We met in August and has been maintaining the fwb situation for over 3 months (met up for 7 times in total, so not that often) 
* We started things in a fwb way but it eventually became more like a situationship in the latter months 
* I made it clear in the beginning that I don‚Äôt want relationship. We get along pretty well on bed but I don‚Äôt want to go further
* We once had a casual convo about things that are considered bf/gf stuff and he said ‚Äútaking cute pics together‚Äù and ‚Äúintroducing to my friends‚Äù, which he initiated doing in the last month. I was confused at the moment but it all happened naturally so I didn‚Äôt communicate my thoughts (maybe I should have) 
* I don‚Äôt like pure hookups so we usually do a lot activities like hiking, dinner and movie when we meet up. Sometimes I spent the night(3/7)
* He said he thinks a situationship shouldn‚Äôt last longer than 3 months, which I‚Äôm fine with 
* I‚Äôm 25F and he‚Äôs 26, doing his PhD rn

But I've never seen the sexual side of a woman.

It's a combo of different things that added up over the years, like dominos falling: trauma from childhood divorce, no real guidance from an older man on how to romantically talk to women, going to an all boys high school, having low self-esteem in adolescence/young adult years/college, all sorts of stuff. Either way, it's just an experience I've missed out on. I just can't relate to most of my peers and I'm well aware of that fact. Most of my friends are married/engaged/in long-term relationships and I'm just...here.

I also know at this age, women will be looking for something somewhat serious and will be surprised/shocked/maybe even disgusted at someone who doesn't know how to get down in bed. My sexual history (or lack thereof) isn't something I'm necessarily proud of, I've never explicitly told anyone (not even my good buds) and it hurts that I've missed out on so much.

I missed out on that period of 20s experimentation where it was ""kinda, sorta ok"" to be inexperienced and just figuring things out. But I'm going to be 30 soon and I'm running out of time. I know I need to take massive action, but just getting past the first step is hard. I know I need to develop confidence, get over fear of rejection, and other things that make me masculine.

He said its personal and he's dealing with a lot and that he's been meaning to tell me this, but I find that hard to believe since he said that right after we had a fight.

I got a weird problem. My girls is literally the woman of my dreams. She has her faults i am sure if I just haven‚Äôt found them yet. The only problem that bothers me is 2 things. One her friendship with this guy who she always jokes and says she related to. She told me something about how he‚Äôs not quite 100% with it (privacy) but I‚Äôve been around him enough that he just seems like a guy that instead of being at a normal 5 all the time he is always at 7 or an 8 in terms of energy. He is not related to her in anyway as much as I wish he was. 

The problem I have with him is he is so engaged when talking to her and the way she talks back to him. I don‚Äôt see her talk back to any other guy like she does with him. I don‚Äôt have any doubt when she told me she views him as a cousin, but he just says things and does small things that I would never do with the girl best friend that I just stopped talking to (for good) because we both finally got into a real relationship. 

But of course my girlfriend won‚Äôt take my hint or see it my way in that I don‚Äôt think having close one-on-one friendships with the opposite sex if you are in a serious relationship with someone is wise or beneficial unless their gay or you ARE related to them. Because it can makes people jealous whether they admit it or not. 

What would you do if you were me? She has already said she has never hung out with him one on one alone before, BUT that on more than one occasion grown up adults like in their 50‚Äôs (she‚Äôs 23, I am 26, her friend is 24/25) have asked and were like what is going on with Jessica and Kevin or has said are they together? (names changed for privacy). And she was shocked, but I see it and I know other have because she admitted they thought that. 


I HATE being like this, but it bothers me. Because yesterday she dragged me to another group date and he came and two times he in his flirty teasing way of talking to her said she should come over to his house and watch a football game. (I don‚Äôt know the details of whether or not he lives alone or with his brother and sister who she is also friends with or whatever) she said she is busy hunting (she told me like 2 days before she‚Äôs never hung out with him alone before) with her dad then he teased her about not knowing anything about hunting.

Then I was like lol I‚Äôm the one that knows nothing about hunting if anyone. Because I don‚Äôt. 

My point is with my ex-best friend because of circumstance I would NEVER invite her to do something at my house (alone or not) and I ESPECIALLY wouldn‚Äôt do it in front of her boyfriend. Like I wished I hadn‚Äôt heard it. Because I knew it would drive me crazy. And it has. Any time I know he‚Äôs coming to something I‚Äôm always inwardly pissed. All her other guy friends are normal and treat her in a non-flirty way. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do because I have already warned her that in my past relationships I would get jealous a lot. And it‚Äôs a red flag I know. 

The other thing that bothers me is her brother. He is like 13. And he constantly feels the need to climb on her and sit and basically just hug her when she is sitting right next to me. Her parents are always like hey so-so get off her or etc. but she doesn‚Äôt mind. So I‚Äôm like well I can‚Äôt say anything about this ever either.

I just remember having a 15 through 20 year old sister and I never would hug her or be overly affection like that and (or the chance I was wrong and did) if I did I definitely didn‚Äôt do it in front of her boyfriend because that‚Äôs just FREAKING weird. Like maybe I have a bad problem but I don‚Äôt know what to do or say about either of these problems. The problem with her friend bothers me more because he‚Äôs grown and is not related to her. And he has said in front of me to her

‚ÄúI love you best friend‚Äù 
‚ÄúWanna come over to my house and watch the game‚Äù
And he just teases her in a way that I would never with my past friend. Who I can promise you I had a better relationship with than she does with him. Like I know I did. We were friends constantly since 2013. We would always talk about who we liked alot among normal things but I kept it platonic because i would always bring up some guy she may have liked at the time. And I know I never told her I loved her and tried teasing her in a flirty way like he‚Äôs done in front of me. 

He never asks her about me. Which a NORMAL platonic friend would do! I mean like come on. It‚Äôs EASY. I don‚Äôt need or want any of his attention but in like the 10+ hours I‚Äôve been around him he‚Äôs not one time asked her about me or tried to tease me in any way about her or asked me about her or her about me. Not once. Her other friend (who I like) it was the first thing he said to me. And he‚Äôs done it more than once which I adore. He‚Äôs normal.

To use her words ‚ÄúI am much closer to Guy than his brother.‚Äù She is also close fiends with his sister as well but she has told me that the guys sister gets mad because the guy will listen to my girlfriend for advice over his sister. Hearing that didn‚Äôt not make me feel better at all.

She has no freaking idea how much it pisses me off. And I know that sounds super controlling. I‚Äôm sorry okay! 

Please give me advice on what to do especially with her friend. I‚Äôm sure her brother will one day grow up and not need his 23 year old sister to TUCK HIM INTO BED. And constantly feel the need to sit her on lap and semi hug cuddle her in front of her boyfriend.

On Monday it was announced that our lockdown would end next week meaning we could hangout with friends etc again and suddenly yesterday (Tuesday) she messages me out of nowhere apologizing saying stuff like omfg I'm so sorry with extra letters on pretty much every word saying she didn't realize I replied etc and I thought whatever since with lockdown I haven't been able to meet new girls etc anyway. So I waited 3 hours and replied asking her wait what? And included a laughing emoji cause thats the kind of idiot I am and now it's been 21 hours and she finally replied, she sent another 2 messages saying how she hasn't really been on insta recently etc and again it's been a couple hours since the last reply.

I am an American (23M) living in Central Asia. I speak the local language, went to a good university and people tell me I am really good-looking. Still, we all have our doubts...I have a large crooked nose and am skinny and I think about this a lot. Anyways, my friend and I were out at a bar and I was introduced to a girl there that he likes (26F). I thought she was super cool and beautiful (turns out she is a somewhat famous dancer) but I wanted to be respectful and give my friend space. My friend and I and this girl bounced around a couple bars and stayed out till 6:00 AM together. The whole time, I was trying to give him space, but she (albeit inebriated) grabbed my hand once or twice and I felt a connection. The next day I asked my friend to tell me how things work out with the girl because I'd be interested in asking her out at some point. To my surprise, he told me to go for it, even though he clearly told me before that he had a thing for her, long before I had ever met her. 

I was elated and a few days later I asked her to get coffee one evening. We met for coffee and towards the end of our time, she suggested going for drinks. At the bar we sat close to one another, we shared a few beers, cigarettes and put our hands on each others' arms, hands, shoulders at natural points in the conversation. We went to two more bars, and at the last one, we danced a little bit (no grinding or anything) and had great conversation before the bar started closing down around 5:00 AM or so. We sort of beat around the bush figuring out what to do next, I mentioned getting a taxi home (not clear if I meant my place or to our own homes). She said she had to go to the bathroom, when she came back she suggested we get food, on her (I had been paying for all the drinks and taxis up to that point). We walked to get food, and she put her arm through my arm, it was an amazing feeling...that closeness and trust with her. We got ramen and drank tea at a busy all night Korean diner, and then around 6:00 AM she got a taxi for us and it dropped her off at her place then went and dropped me off at my place. 

We have a second date tonight at a restaurant and I just don't know what to think. My gut tells me there is something here, but I have been on probably 50 first dates in the last few years and and not that many second and third dates (90% of the time it is me to end things) and I have never been in a relationship. I don't think I have a typical personality, and I think the age difference is a big deal to her.  I like this girl more than I have liked the vast majority of women I have gone on dates with so far, and really want things to work but I am afraid that she may not really like me.

He broke up with me but I begged him back the very next day. Since then, I've been acting like I don't care that he cheated. But I do care and it really bothers me. 

The other day I brought it up to him about his unfaithfulness 3 years ago and he said that he was thinking of me while having sex with her. At this point I don't know what to say or do. I just froze and sweat. The only time him and I have a genuine conversation is when we are sexting. Any other time, he is playing video games with his friends. I've been thinking about breaking up with him but I don't know how. 

6 months ago he was suppose to pick me up to move in with him. We are in a LDR btw. He doesn't have a education or a job. His room is nasty and when he sends me pictures of himself, in the background you could see the dirty carpet with crumbs/stains. He has bottles under his bed. He doesn't clean his fingernails and when he sends me sexy pics, it looks like he is wearing the same underwear. 

Idk if this is normal or not, he is my first long relationship. I should also add that he follows many women in his area and that makes me feel uneasy. He liked one of her sexy pics on instagram. He also complements his really hot female friend on facebook. She already gets enough attention and complements, why does my boyfriend gotta complement her? It makes me feel like he is hitting on her.

I've always asked girls out relatively fast. But I often also get the impression that most women prefer to build comfort through text before meeting up. And this is the dilemma I face now. What is the best approach? Women, what do you prefer?

IRL and over the phone I get great results, but I struggle with texting, I just find small-talk boring and shallow. I would much rather learn more about her when I sit in front of her, and I can't wait to get off the phone and meet the person IRL. And I struggle with being present in text interactions, as I overthink the messages too much which makes me a rather slow responder, whereas IRL and over the phone, I'm really smooth and confident and the conversations flow naturally. For me, texting is just a tool for quick messages, not a media to build rapport on. All my successes with women on online dating have been where we met up soon after matching, and in those instances where that isn‚Äôt possible, I fail.

\- Is it the lack of sub-communication (eye contact, body language, charm) that makes texting hard?

\- Am I failing to create enough comfort/security for her through texting prior to meeting up?

\- Is it my texting ""skills"" that are lacking? Am I supposed to be some kind of entertainer on text?
