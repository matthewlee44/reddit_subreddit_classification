How do you get over feeling like maybe there's someone better out there but then at the same time you feel like you'd be passing on something wonderful with the person you are with? 

For context: I was in a relationship then married to my ex-husband for 16 years. Then I took two years for myself after the divorce. Now I'm in a relationship with a great guy for 5 months. He was only the second guy I met from OLD so I've never ""played the field."" And while he's amazing and thinks the world of me, I'm starting to notice some little quirks that give me pause. Not red flags... Just oddities about being extremely germophobic. I've always classified myself as a germophobe but this has me beat. I know I'm not perfect.... No one is. I didn't really think about it until the possibility of a cross country move came up for his career and he asked if I'd consider moving with him (I said no... I'm happy with my career and I have kids that I can't just uproot and again... we've only been dating 5 months). It would make me sad if he moved but I would be so happy for him with the opportunity it would open for him. Am I just finding things to question because I'm scared of commitment? Or am I'm walling up my heart so it won't hurt so bad in anticipation that he moves? It has me thinking that even though he is amazing and treats me like a queen, that maybe I'd be settling by living with these quirks. Would I find someone less obsessive with germs but then have some other quirk that's more annoying? Or maybe I would I never find anyone else at all? 

Also, another part of me doesn't want to leave my job... I don't see myself ever wanting to leave it until I retire which is at least 25+ years away. He was ready to buy a house here (not with me or because of me... We aren't moving that fast... But because he likes where we live and wanted to put down roots) and then this opportunity came up. So what if we continue in a relationship/possibly marriage and this comes up again about a relocation? I know relationships are about compromise and we talked about this scenario in the very beginning of dating but I guess I never expected it to be a possibility so soon. He said it would be something we make a decision on together and he's not looking for someone to just blindly follow him.... But I feel selfish for not even wanting to entertain the idea in the future.

But romantic relationships still remain a challenge. I used to completely shut down when problems arose but have become more comfortable with communicating around challenges. I can be a bit of an emotional rollercoaster as emotional regulation is hard for me due to the ADHD. The good news is that I can go from sad to happy in like 10 minutes or less. I used to need a lot of reassurance but now I'm more comfortable with less - basically, send me the occasional ""good morning"" or ""I'm thinking about you text"" and help with planning dates and I'm mostly good. I say mostly as I am sure there are times when I need more reassurance, and I still have difficulty with expressing wants and needs. This is an area I am definitely still working on and have made some improvements, but have a long way to go.

I don't have the baby drive but I connect easily with older children. 

I didn't know I'd end up leaving my ex. It's been 5 years since then (final for 4) and I've done the work on myself. My life is solid, but healing has been a higher priority than dating. I'm very social so I meet lots of men, but no real prospects. And that's okay. 

I always pictured fostering/adopting as something I'd do with a partner. But as much as I'd love to fall in love, I've gotten pretty comfortable alone. I started to think.... why would I put finding a partner as a prerequisite? Fostering/adoption is more meaningful to me than the dim hope of romantic love that may never happen anyway.

So I'm going forward. And I'm really excited! It'll be a while until I'm approved, but I'm getting things ready. The room is coming together nicely. I'm reading and learning. I don't know who this girl is yet but I already feel love towards her.

I (40 F) have been dating a single father (40 M) for nearly a year. We are long distance (several hours drive) and overall have a wonderful relationship - we laugh, have great physical and intellectual connection, mutually supportive of one another's busy careers, we both treat each other well and respectfully, we get along with one another's friends.  I care for and admire him deeply. Our ""honeymoon"" phase was hot and heavy and we developed a bond very quickly. The past few months we've been struggling with logistics and intimacy, which has caused me to feel a bit distant and insecure. Now that it's post lockdown our lives are getting busier and he seems to have less time for me though he still makes effort to drive to see me every couple weeks. We went from seeing each other every week, now to every 2-3 weeks. But lately he's always exhausted, after dinner he just wants to sleep and in the morning he wants to sleep in, so our intimacy is lacking (went from the best sex I've ever had to average). We also have gone from talking multiple times a day to talking multiple times a week. Overall, I feel our relationship has lessened across a number of categories and he's putting in significantly less effort. He says that we are just transitioning out of the honeymoon phase into something more comfortable and that in general he's a lot busier than I am (being a single father). This is not untrue but I'm still struggling and feeling my needs aren't being met. I am not the type of woman who needs to be with or talk to my man all the time, I'm pretty independent. But being long distance is complicated, our calls are all we have, it's the only way we can maintain a connection and be part of each other's lives.

The other challenge I have is I haven't formally met his child (4 years old, who he has 50/50 custody), which can feel painful at times as I feel disconnected from the most important part of his life. We met briefly 6 months ago and it made me so happy, I just fell deeper in love with both of them. But based on the separation agreement with his ex I can't spend time with their child until I meet with his ex. I facetime with him and his child occasionally but he has expressed he's not ready to make a formal introduction (i.e. start spending regular time together), mainly bc of the bad relationship with his ex (he feels she might lash out and cause problems) but more importantly, he just doesn't feel ready. I understand this is a big step, so I'm trying to be patient. But it's been almost a year and he has not expressed much empathy or understanding for the position I'm in (I have tried to explain how this makes me feel multiple times but I'm met mostly with defensiveness). And with all the factors I've mentioned above my insecurities are starting to get the better of me and I'm left wondering if perhaps he just doesn't have space or energy for me in his life, and if he's still unsure of me/us after 10 months of dating is that a red flag? He seems content with our situation but I feel I need a little more and it doesn't seem like he can give more at this time.

I don't want to lose what we have bc I think we have a great connection and could see creating a future together. I should also add he has mentioned having kids and marriage with me - obviously I am 40 so having children is tricky but something I'd love to share with him. I'm trying to figure out how patient I should be w a busy single dad, what's reasonable to request of him and if I need to be more assertive about what I need in our relationship.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,56606,public,self,,,Advice for Dating a Single Dad - how patient should I be?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pf9727/advice_for_dating_a_single_dad_how_patient_should/,,some_ads,7,,,,,

We weren’t in a defined relationship — we were best friends who did a lot of partying together in college and had a sexual relationship that lasted for the four years we were together. I always assumed I was more into him than he was me, as I wanted a real boyfriend-girlfriend relationship and never got it. He joined the military and after a few years, he was married. We never spoke after he left. It took years for me to stop thinking of him. He often crossed my mind, as a “What if…”

When we reconnected, our chats were sporadic and more focused on catching up. But the connection was still there. We would talk on the phone for hours. He would continuously say things like, “I wish you lived closer,” or “I’ve never forgotten about you.” He lives about 5 hours away now, and we started flirting with the idea of seeing each other, but one of us always backed out, and then he would go silent for weeks/months. In addition to the distance, our lives have turned out very different. I am career focused, never married and have no kids; he’s been married twice, has three kids and works a blue collar job. I’m not deterred by this at all, but our lifestyles are opposite.

Then, out of the blue, I receive a message from him saying he had been putting too much pressure on himself and that was why he’d been backing off. He told me he seriously wanted to see me, but not for sex. That he wanted to take me on a real date, get to know me again, and see what happened. I was taken aback at how forthcoming and earnest he seemed. I told him I loved that idea, and that we should plan something. True to form, I didn’t hear back from him until months later. His excuse was that he thought the conversation didn’t go well. I admit, I was shocked and probably didn’t immediately embrace what he said. It just wasn’t like him. But I was enthusiastic and very into the idea. 

Fast forward six months, after I’d reached out a few times with no response, and he reaches out to me. We chat via text for a few days, and eventually, have a three hour phone conversation. He confessed he’d always had strong feelings toward me. He brought back things from our past, and the memories he had were a little different than the way I remembered things. My self esteem at the time was very low, and hearing his side of things made me realize that the love I felt wasn’t really unrequited, I just wasn’t in a position to receive it. He invited me to visit for the weekend, and I made the spontaneous and uncharacteristic decision to drive to his town the next day for the weekend. 

It was magical. He did everything right. There were about ten minutes of awkwardness, but we immediately became so comfortable with each other. We drank coffee and watched the sunrise, went to brunch and walked around his town, dined at very nice restaurants where we shared bottles of wine and amazing conversation. He said it was the best date he’d ever had, and I wholeheartedly agreed. The sex was great; it was more loving and romantic than in the past. He was so kind and considerate, he looked at me like I was the woman of his dreams, he held my hand in the car, he kissed me on the forehead. I was sad to leave him to come home, but I was excited to see where things were headed. In all my years of dating, I finally was having the feeling I’d been chasing for so long. I had a strong premonition that he was the one.

Over the next few weeks, we exchanged messages, had a few short phone calls, but it was back to reality for both of us. Long days at work, his kids back in school, and he started slowly dropping off. After some drinks, I asked him why he was backing off. He didn’t answer, but a few days later, he told me he had a busy, not great week and apologized that he hadn’t had the time or energy to engage. I understood, and told him that I did want to talk soon. I wanted to establish some expectations for moving forward. I didn’t want him to think I was expecting constant contact, but I did expect consistency. I decided a once a week phone call and occasional texting was enough and hopefully would not be a strain on him as a hard working single dad. (he works a demanding job and takes on several side jobs in the hopes of launching his own business at the end of the year.) I planned to ask that we see each other every 4-6 weeks, and since I have fewer responsibilities at home and can work remotely, I was prepared to go to him more often than he came to me. I just wanted him to commit to making an effort and to take things day by day, visit by visit. 

I’ve been patiently waiting to talk, thinking I’d get my chance the next weekend he was without the kids. That was last weekend. I messaged him Saturday evening, we chatted back and forth about our week and day. 

Then, he says, “I don’t see any reason we should continue talking. We are different people with different lives. You couldn’t begin to understand what my life is like with the kids. Long distance sucks and I have too many variables. You are in a good place with a great career that you don’t need to leave, and I don’t want to see you throw it all away for this. It’s just irresponsible. It has nothing to do with you. We are just in different places and I see no reason to try this when I know I can’t make it work.”

I asked him if we could talk, that I thought he was borrowing problems and worried about things that hadn’t even happened yet. I work in higher ed, and I didn’t share this because I didn’t want him to think I was moving too fast, but he lives very close to two universities where I have great contacts and am confident I could land a great job — probably even a better one than I currently have — if I was patient. But realistically, that is at least a year down the road. I told him that I deserved the opportunity to make my own decision about my future, and that he should respect me enough to at least hear my side or give me his over the phone. Not in short messages. The conversation ended, I could see I wasn’t getting anywhere.

His last relationship was not great, and I know he is very apprehensive about being hurt like that again. Ever since we first reconnected, he has had a sadness about him. Almost like he wasn’t fulfilled and is lonely, but he had accepted being alone and putting his kids first. 

I messaged him the next day and asked if I could call him that night to talk. He replied and said his son was spending the night, and that the next day would be better. I messaged him the next day, saying I would call at a certain time, and to let me know if that wasn’t good for him. No reply, so I called at the mentioned time. No answer. I called again an hour later. No answer. 

I am heartbroken. I feel so strongly that we are meant to be together, but even if we aren’t, I deserve an opportunity to share my feelings and I deserve a conversation. I know it will be a hard talk, but we are adults.

We weren’t in a defined relationship — we were best friends who did a lot of partying together in college and had a sexual relationship that lasted for the four years we were together. I always assumed I was more into him than he was me, as I wanted a real boyfriend-girlfriend relationship and never got it. He joined the military and after a few years, he was married. We never spoke after he left. It took years for me to stop thinking of him. He often crossed my mind, as a “What if…”

When we reconnected, our chats were sporadic and more focused on catching up. But the connection was still there. We would talk on the phone for hours. He would continuously say things like, “I wish you lived closer,” or “I’ve never forgotten about you.” He lives about 5 hours away now, and we started flirting with the idea of seeing each other, but one of us always backed out, and then he would go silent for weeks/months.

Yes, lots of food, beer, walking, gas station sandwiches, the works. I saw the window of travel open up and took a chance on a cool country. Glad I did.  

But I noticed some things that might help some of you along the way. Or you disagree with. Either way, it's ok.   First off, this is a comparison between the PNW and Europe...which us Pacific Northwesterners don't really dress up too much. Europeans put a little more effort into even their daily appearance.  Not really over the top...well, there were some exceptions to that rule on both men and women.  But the biggest takeaway I got from the direct comparison is that it only takes (at least for a short haired guy like me) a little effort to dress better. I didn't feel I had to wear a fancy sweater tied around my shoulders, but a button up shirt instead of a t shirt and some casual shoes (like pumas, etc..) was a good compromise for the environment. I don't think I'll be joining the skin tight jorts or peg legging jeans camp anytime soon, but here's your fashion forward warning. I won't give any women's fashion advice here, since I can say that picking out clothing for myself was a stressful enough of an endeavor, but I appreciated how (again, a PNW and a guy's perspective) simply it seemed the women were able to dress and still looked nice. 

I didn't go out with the intention of intimacy, and I certainly didn't find any while I was there (I think the stories of traveling hookups are 95% made up anyway), just to get that out of the way.  But I have gone out for years in my area and not made acquaintances as easily as I did there. I ended up every night I wanted some companionship, I found people to hang out with. Whether it was the Dutch women I ended up playing cards with at the bar, the Belgian woman that I complimented and ended up drinking beers with her and her friends 2 nights during my trip, the Brazilian guys that I ended up bar-hopping with, or the odd Belgian guy who had a watch fetish and a few too many drinks, I was really surprised at how easy it was to strike conversations and have friendly company nearly every night of my trip. I wish friendships were that easy to start here in the PNW.  My takeaway is that I can meet people, even though I get in my own head sometimes, and maybe I just live in the wrong area of the country/state to meet people. 

Traveling solo is great. And it sucks. You experience tons of things that you can only share in photos. Noone to share in the awe of the situation, or tell you later how cool something was, or how much it sucked. I still wouldn't have skipped the trip.  I got out of my comfort zone and experienced a whole new country and people, and came back knowing that I need to dress a &lt;little&gt; better when I go out for an evening dinner or to grab a drink, esp. since as a guy it doesn't take much (at least here) to make a decent improvement.  And, even as a lego guy shaped human, I'm still decent enough looking to have people open to talking with me as a stranger, even if that is 4000 miles away. It might not sound like a confidence boost, but it is.  

So, with the fall/winter season coming,(yes, I know, it's only September) and what feels like the door slowly closing on the dating season, I have some really good memories and experiences to keep me warm through the cold, rainy season here. Not the same as an affectionate, compatible human...but maybe once the spring arrives, so will a new group of people that I can meet and expand my circle with.

Anyhow. I do plan on meeting him when I make it back. Finally.

Thing is, we sort of connected over having dogs. &amp; we both love hiking. I'm thinking it would be logical to ask him out on a hike, but since my dog is a bit of an a$$, I see nothing but trouble brewing there (a day of managing my dog, and his issues, not actually interacting with each other). But not bringing him would seem like I am hiding him away and would also feel wrong somehow... (besides, I sort of value his opinion of people, bit skewed as it may be.)

Safer to go with a coffee date? There it would be easy to explain not bringing the mutt. But then I'd be sitting there with someone whom I've literally talked about everything with already, so I think it would be strange... besides, he doesn't drink coffee (still debating how much of a character flaw I consider that :-p ).

What do you think? Is the dog the ultimate test, or should I save that encounter for a bit further down the road?

We had been texting daily on an app for the last week or so. He asked me out, I accepted. We negotiated a place. I was early, he was on time. We sat and chatted for about 2 1/2 hours - both of us laughing and sharing... it felt comfortable and although neither of us were being overtly flirtatious it felt like we liked each other and things were going well. 

Then, suddenly he says that it's time for him to head home. Like, I had no indication that we were wrapping things up. So I get up and say that I need to cash out at the bar and he says something like, let's do this again and gives me a hug and then disappears. 

I went and cashed out and walked back to my car and drove home feeling absolutely confused. It felt like our conversation was flowing smoothly, there were no weird hiccups. I really don't get it. I would normally have expected this to end with him waiting for me to cash out to walk me to my car and then perhaps a nice text when he got home to say it was nice to meet or something. I'm not oblivious, I would have picked up on the 'no chemistry' or 'bad vibes' feelings, I think.

However I lost a lot of weight and now with dating, when things begin to get physical I am always very embarrassed about the residual loose skin around my abdomen and upper thighs. It’s a natural consequence after being overweight and losing that weight, and unfortunately it can only be dealt with through expensive plastic surgery, that I can’t afford right now.  I am proud of my weight loss, but I don’t want it to define me, which is why I preferred to try to wait before I disclosed that information to people in my life. (Most of my work colleagues don’t even know that I used to be overweight.) 

However, now I’m starting to think that maybe if I just put it out there in my OLD profile that men will then just know, going into dating me, that my body isn’t going to be perfect, and I will have loose skin, since I have lost so much. So I’m asking; Is this a good idea? Or is it better that I wait to disclose this personal information until we know each other better? What do you all think?

Regardless of how well the conversations seem to go, eventually almost everyone seems to end up ghosting me.

I ask them questions about themselves and their interests, and I always at least reply when they message.

If they seem uninteresting I'll politely let them know that I don't think we have much in common and wish them well in their dating journey.

I would argue there were perhaps many mixed signals but no handholding, kisses or sex. We enjoyed going for walks, eating dinner together at my place or his, watching Netflix, etc but neither of us initiated a conversation about how we felt or whether we wanted to take things further. 

I suppose I knew on some level at some point that I was friend-zoned but again…mixed signals. Anyway, it still came as an unpleasant surprise when he suddenly asked me recently at dinner “So, how’s your summer dating going?” as if we had already had a conversation defining what we were doing. He then proceeded to tell me all about a woman he’s met, their courtship history and how after 2 dates they were going away that weekend for an overnight. I was rather stunned at the admission, the way he did it and I felt like all that was necessary might have been a simple “I like you, I enjoy hanging out with you but I’m not feeling anything romantic here…” No need to elaborate on the rest. 

We finished the dinner and evening fine but the way he did that didn’t sit right with me. Blurting out “How’s your summer dating going?” was obviously a setup for him to share his news. I did tell him later that it made me uncomfortable, told him why, and said ‘I’m sure you didn’t mean to upset me but I thought you should know how it made me feel.” He appreciated that and suggested we meet in person to discuss, which we did. 

We talked and I felt good about getting some things off my chest, asking my questions, even though I believe he still was not completely honest or straightforward at times. Even if he didn’t answer truthfully or directly, that’s still an answer for me. I’m not heartbroken, nor am I jealous over this woman he’s met. It’s about finding happiness, if not with each other then with the right person. 

Anyway, he wrote me again days later to say hi, how’s it going, how was your weekend? I see no reason to continue communicating. Can’t imagine his girlfriend would be pleased to know he’s talking and hanging out with someone he met on a dating app, either.

I thought about gauging her interest at one point, but there are a few reasons why she may not be into me. I think she wants kids in her future, I already have 2, and a vasectomy (she is 38, I'm 44). She is a little taller than me, and much more of a beast in the gym than I am. I think she may want a traditional attentive boyfriend, but I'm a little limited in that area as I have primary custody of my kids and they come first in my life. If I thought she were actually interested I would jump at the chance because she is a great person not to mention gorgeous.

So in any event, we've been in each other's DMs and are looking like we're gonna grab drinks Saturday. She actually invited me out last week with a few mutual friends but I had to decline.

In view of this whole situation, should I believe she is interested here? I have history of reading these things wrong. And to complicate things even further, I've been seeing someone else, not with an exclusivity talk but definitely steady, who is also somewhat out of my league. But my interest in gym girl is too strong to not explore this.

If people just wanted to talk and never set up a date I'd end it with them. I had quite a few dates, then ended up in a relationship with someone for 18 months. I'm finally feeling like I'm in a good place and ready to date again after that ended, but OLD seems so different now...

I am still matching with a lot of people, but one of two things is happening. They either chat for a day or 2 then disappear (which is fine, I just unmatch and move on) or we hit it off, have great conversation, set up a date, and then the DAY OF, they text me to cancel, saying they just aren't ready to date, they are still processing their divorce, etc etc...  They always say things like ""it's not you"", etc. Thanks, I know lol...

It's infuriating! Not only is it just frustrating from the standpoint of whyyyy are you on the apps if you don't have the balls to go on a date? But it's also so disrespectful of my time and my feelings. (I obviously try to limit feelings lol, but I do get excited about dates and meeting someone new!)

This post is intended for amusement  and learning. Warning: it’s long. 


I decided to try OLD again; I only create 1 profile on 1 site at a time since it’s enough bs to wade through. Day2 I get a like from a rather good looking fella (flag1 - in my head: *why would he be having trouble meeting people*) who actually isn’t my type since he’s sporting a full, but groomed beard (flag2 - *everyone says to be open to meeting someone that I would not typically meet*). Pleasant openings were exchanged of a few sentences. I inquired about ethnicity since his was listed as ‘Other’; to which was told he was from the Netherlands. (*isn’t that still Caucasian?* -Flag3 But whatever since maybe it’s just a US delineation) He asked what I’m looking for &amp; even though ‘Something casual’ is on my profile, I answer ‘occasional dating, for now’. When I reversed the question, his was a ‘serious relationship’ which didn’t surprise me since ‘long-term relationship’ was selected on his profile. Then the long, diatribe of what a loving, committed relationship looks like started. (Ummm BIGFlag1), but I asked: “what does that look like to you? Exclusivity? What do you call the time between meeting &amp; getting to know leading towards a committed relationship?” To which he simplistically answered ‘friendship’. (*ok, that I can do*) 


Some more casual exchanges occur for another 2 days before he suggested we move to WhatsApp. Here’s Lesson1: WhatsApp is tied to your phone number. Even with using the QR generated code, the info is still shared. WhatsApp isn’t my preferred texting method, but of course he didn’t have KIK or Skype, both of which are linked to an email account. I’ve gotten criticized for not trustingly giving my phone number to a nice fella that became a FWB earlier in the year; so I’m was trying not to be so ridged.  Flag4 - Funny enough, his initial greeting was “hello pretty” but considering ‘beautiful’ is overused &amp; not quite to ‘dear, sexy, or gorgeous’ yet, I let it slide. Over the next few days, my actual name from my profile was never used to address me - BIGFlag#.  


Lesson2: Another weird thing I noticed with WhatsApp is that his messages never showed the check marks turning green for ‘read’ which was completely different than when I text with my friends on the same app. BIGFlag2 Plus, if he commented on something I wrote or shared, it would paste the repeated dialogue box over his response. Again, not the same as when used with my friends. Deductive reasoning concludes that it’s from using the app on a desktop and not a personal mobile device, but I’m just theorizing. 


Then the personal questions started: ‘what is your family like…?’ In which I gave general info and never any names. Standard get to know intro. But when asked in return, he was an only child of deceased parents, and wife passed away 8yrs ago during birth of his son. (*Tragic but really?!?* HUGEFlag) This is the start to when I am pretty sure I’m getting catfished; I know that we will never meet, but am curious to know what tragedy is going to be spun to ask for money. So I don’t report and block at that time because I would have missed some of the hilarity below.  


When asked what he [CF for CatFish from here on out] liked to do for fun, holy moly word vomit ensued: “ I enjoy cooking, especially when cooking with someone special; … good conversation and am a good listener. Holding hands at the beach with my partner and watching the beauties of nature, like to spend a quiet time with my woman at the fireplace telling her some good stories and running my fingers through her hair, dancing, i am a very romantic man who love to treat my woman like queen” and more: “ I also like exploring i love to travel out new places and activities. Finding the simple pleasures with a special someone at the grocery store, walks along the lake, just hanging out can be magical making anywhere in the world our hot spot. I am a fun loving person ,loves to try new things, but sometimes my mood matters, the weather too matters, when its rainy, love to sit at the fireplace, cuddle, loves to read novels while the thunder storms is making its noise out side, when i am  with my partner love to play with her  romantically , pillow fights and all that, and it  would be fun reading her some good novel till  we fall asleep together. But on normal day, love to cook at the kitchen, drive around town with no destination looking around and seeing new places.” WOW that was overkill imho. 


When asked my favorite color, I only provided a specific shade, one word answer, and got back: “My favorite colors are both white and red, because the white stands for a pure heart and the red stands for love, so when you add the both of them together you have a pure hearted love, that is me because I do have a pure heart for love” *Oh my* - big eye roll time. 


In the middle of Q&amp;A, “I’m off to the Gym, but I’m open to text and reply you until when I start to work out”. That’s great to set reasonable expectations that one is not always available but… it’s a Sunday evening… 8pm … as a single dad of an 8 year old that should be getting ready for bed &amp; school the next day. (*that must be some amazing babysitter or super kind neighbors*) I’m not complaining since a vid clip of overhead shoulder presses was sent; clothed, not offensive, but you know - planned proof that the workout occurred. When later asked what CF’s kid was doing while at evening gym trips, ‘watching movie’ was the concise reply. 


The morning greetings went above and beyond a simple hello: “ Good morning pretty, I hope you slept well? Every day is beautiful. Each day is special. Each day is a gift of God, and this is why we call it the 'present'. May the light and freshness of this new day, bring in a sweet vibe in your life. Live the day, as if there is no tomorrow And enjoy every moment, like there are no worries. I wish you a fragrant and beautiful day.💞🌹” and “ Good morning pretty🥰 Yesterday, today and tomorrow are all a chain of achievements for a hard working person like you. May you get all that you work for and aspire for. May you paint this world with your colors so bright and cheerful. May all you do be so beautiful. Have a lovely day dear 🌹🌹”


See a pattern yet? When CF asked the question, a long answer was most likely cut/copy/pasted; but when I asked a question, it was short and usually with broken English.  Feel free to ask a question [like favorite food? Music? Sports? Temper? Looking in the mirror? Past marital life affect now? Goals &amp; dreams? kind of mate? Problem with marriage? Favorite attributes of another? How romantic are you? Why looking online? Likes &amp; dislikes again? Favorite thing to do alone?  Inspiration in life? What is love? Trait to maintain a successful relationship? Communication properties?] you might use to when getting to know someone new and if I have CF’s answer, I will provide so you can get a feel for the exchange. 


Ready for more ridiculous? CF apparently has tons of money. “I drive Mercedes Benz, Range Rover, BMW….I’m looking forward to get sweet sport Lamborghini or Bugatti” *Dream big single dad!* 


I actually think this is a good Q: “…can you tell me what would make you smile on a blue day?” But it seemed that “Dad jokes and maybe cheesy pun memes” was not the correct answer since a smile &amp; someone else’s happiness was all it took for CF. 


I was surprised I wasn’t pressed for more info when asked what I do for a living since my response was very general and then added: “ I don’t prefer to get into the specifics of my profession until after meeting in person and getting to know each other more”.  CF said he was a mechanical engineer… on an underwater oil rig… (*hold up - engineers I know are concise, not verbose; plus what happens with the kid when working onsite?*) The plot thickens! 


When asked what CF had for breakfast: “I had Sandwiches”. And what did you put in your sandwiches? “ Whole wheat, sourdough and rye” (isn’t that just toast?*) 


CF was the first to mention “… I look forward to spending some time with you in person.“ Of course I took the bait &amp; asked: “Is there a lunch time this week that you could meet?” But got a brush off: “I will notify you when is possible ok“   


Was day5 (yes only 5) the right time to list out the factors that go into a successful relationship? There’s 7. It was an active copy&amp;paste day for CF. 


And for the final question i tolerated: “pretty Tonight you can do anything you want, No penalties, No reprisals and the Cost is Unimportant. What are you going to do?” in which “sleep” was not the answer CF wanted since he had plans: “Since it's only for one night I would drive down to (my city), order me the BIGGEST FRESHEST LOBSTER I could find, eat every single bite, then get a room at the swankest hotel right off the beach, dress in the most GORGEOUS 40's something outfit and go dancing with my specific woman, take my telescope to the hotel roof and watch the stars until I got sleepy, sleep without any phone ringing, any cell phone ringing any TV going, get up in the morning and drive back to (CF’s city)”. More big dreams but also big holes since both of our cities are less than 50 miles apart and both are land locked.  Hmm. When I checked the profile again, low and behold the city had been changed to a coastal town in another state. 


Lesson3: don’t forget with whom you are conversing.  When I attempted to read the OLD messages, the account had been locked and under investigation. I’m heart broken I wasn’t the only one on CF’s agenda. I did also report it as a fake, and subsequently blocked on WhatsApp. 


The irony was not lost on me that the following day I got a text on my real message app: “Your AppIe-lD account has been locked for security reasons. To unlock it, You have to provide some additional information: [hyperlink provided]”. LESSON4: please NEVER click a link when you don’t truly know the source. Yes I reported it to Apple.

I feel like I am a high value woman, have a successful career, am fit, look good, am nice, overall a good communicator and willing to make the time for someone I'm interested in, etc. And I'd like the same in a potential partner. We're all busy but I think if you like a person, you make time for them, not excuses. I've verified both of these men are who they say they are and they're legit. They're both successful business men and have busy lives just as I do.  *side rant - communication is a big thing to me and I don't understand why men don't ask me a lot of questions about myself. Do they not care to know me as a person? I'm not just a vagina. Ugh! 

So anyway, I had matched with guy #1 a couple years ago, talked and texted and went on one date. It was fun and he was sweet but something felt off. He didn't ask for a second date and that was that. 2 weeks ago I saw him on OLD and swiped right as I thought, why not. It was a match as he had already swiped right on me. We started texting and caught up. He explained that he thinks I'm a great catch but at the time of our first date, he was dealing with fall out from a stalker ex who wouldn't leave him alone. Plausible explanation. I asked him to lunch but he had a meeting. I told him he's not in my friend zone so if he's interested in a date to let me know. He told me he definitely wants to take me on a date....and then nothing. He hasn't asked and I'm stumped. He's also not a big texter so communication is limited. And I feel like I'm in limbo with him, and I don't like it.

Guy #2 is awesome and I really like him. We've been texting for about two weeks also. We have a lot in common but live about 7 hours apart. I haven't been on a date with him in person yet. We talk on and off but some days it's minimal which I think is because we're both really busy. I make more of an effort to text during the day than he does. He answers some of my questions, but not others. Overall he does okay, just not as communicative as I would like. 

I guess my questions are: 
1-Do I let both of them know I'd like more communication from them, even if that means all communication ends because they can't or won't give me more? I don't want crumbs from anyone, I'm worth more than that.
2-Or is this how it works now and I'm just getting ahead of myself and need to be patient? Because as things move forward, even if it's slow, it will get better.

I(48F) finally ended the nearly 5 month LDR relationship with a man (38) who had been taking chunks out of my emotional and mental health for the past month. His high school sweetheart died in July of this year and he took it really hard because she'd been the ""love of (his) life"" and ""soulmate"". It just got to the point where I just couldn't do it anymore. The constant pictures, posts and videos about her and how much he loved and missed her were all over his social media platforms. He changed his profile pic to the last pic they'd taken together. I had to see all of this nearly every day for weeks and then he'd turn around and text or facetime me, wanting to cry, vent or talk about her because he had ""nobody else to talk to"". I tried to be supportive and understanding, at first, even though it was becoming increasingly difficult for me considering the newness of our relationship and my feelings for him. I felt like the 3rd wheel, like I was invading their space. Yet, I put aside my feelings and actually felt guilty for feeling the way that I did. All for a guy who, when it came to us being exclusive, was ""weary of a specific commitment because he'd been burned"". But then he later love bombs me. The triggers and the crossed boundaries were just too much and he could never see things from my side. As much as I tried to be caring, understanding and supportive, I found myself feeling more like his therapist than potential love mate and began feeling insecure and resentful. Despite the fact that he was aware it was bothering me, he continued. I take responsibility for the fact that I didn't set proper boundaries and hold him accountable as I should have early on, but it just never seemed to be the right time. Two days ago, we had a terrible argument regarding a question I'd asked him about their relationship and it annoyed him because it was a question he'd been asked numerous times since she and he had been together. It was really bad and that is when I decided I needed to take a step back and allow him to continue the journey through his grieving process without me.  His heart was, understandably, broken but don't we all deserve to be loved by healed hearts, not broken ones? He never answers his phone so I broke up with him using the voice record option on Messenger.🤦‍♀️ He deserved a phone call, I know, but he hates using the phone and never answered it when I call.  He ended up calling me, on his phone no less, some time later just as I'd gotten into bed and he was livid!! He seemed more upset about the fact that I didn't call him on the phone and that I'd cancelled my flight to visit him next week. He was literally yelling at me because he'd bought me all these gifts and rented a car (which is odd considering we had already agreed that he'd send an Uber to pick me up and drop me off at the airport then I would rent a car for 2 separate days we'd planned on visiting a couple tourist attractions) and that his wallet would take a hit (and here I am out roughly $100 due cancelling my flight). He never ONCE expressed a desire to address the reasons why I felt like I needed to take a step back and prioritize my own emotional needs over his, but I guess it didn't really matter at that point anyway. I hope he gets to the place where he can let her rest and then resolve their past and his other issues. I think I was in the way of that. I hope he will be okay. I, on the other hand, am done with dating for the foreseeable future. I don't think I'm nearly as ready for what's out there these days as I'd hoped.

It's not that I don't match with guys in their 40s, it's that they appear very rarely at all no matter what I set my range to. Of my choices, I've gone with the young ones thus far, because I live a pretty young life. Gym rat of the small and ripped variety, roller derby player, still working aggressively and likely to do so for quite a while yet, live adjacent to a college campus/downtown and love how lively it is.
