He is an attractive doctor and after not very much conversation we decided to meet up for dinner the very same evening we matched. He was about 20 minutes late despite living within 10 minutes walking distance. It was a nice day so I didn’t mind a ton, and he was fairly communicative about running late. The conversation flowed easily and we found that we could have intelligent discussions about both my field and his, which is always attractive to me. After finishing a sushi meal, we decided to continue the evening with a margarita and taco at a different spot we could walk to. 
It was a good amount of chemistry, flirting and laughing so when we he invited me to come hang by his place afterward I agreed. 
We listened to some music for a bit, quizzing each other on whether we had heard of some of each other’s favorite songs. After a bit he asked me to dance with him to a sexy song and I was not feeling it but I appreciated his fun attitude so tried to go with it for a bit, but I felt awkward. It was starting to get late for a week night any way so I mentioned it being time for me to leave. 
After agreeing we both enjoyed each other’s company, we exchanged a kiss. This is when I realized he was sweating a bit so the kiss felt very wet from his upper lip sweating, almost like there wasn’t a separation between his lips and the skin around it. The pace was fine but the kiss itself didn’t leave me wanting more. I didn’t hold it against him thinking there is not much to do about a little sweat this one time. He walks me home which is only 5 mins from his place, quite convenient. Or risky. He had mentioned inviting me to go out with his friends over the weekend but didn’t follow up on that, I think his dad ended up visiting but I didn’t know until after the weekend had passed. 
He reaches out via text a couple days later and we make plans to get dinner the following evening, another week night. 
We start off with a round of drinks, he had paid for our first date so I paid for the first round. He got us some tacos. I paid for the next round of drinks as well, nbd but I was surprised that he didn’t even make a move to pay either time. The night is going well again so at the end of the meal he mentions going back to his place but I suggest mine since that is where I’ll be most comfortable. 
Skip to the chase, we end up hooking up after having a discussion about stds and safe sex. The kissing is pretty good! He really struggles to find my clit when rubbing on me, and it’s a little aggressive. There is a lot of spanking and I feel like the rest of the passion isn’t on par with the enthusiastic spanking. He gets on his knees while I’m standing to continue rubbing but doesn’t make a move to eat me out. We move things to the bedroom and I’m using my hands on him too. He positions himself on his knees while I’m laying down, putting his dick pretty close to my face. This is a turn off when he had not given me any head before now. I don’t do it. He did make me squirt eventually by using his fingers. He asks about getting a condom to which I agree. He had made a comment on the first date about lasting a long time and not being able to finish after drinking but I didn’t see evidence of either of these things. We did missionary with my legs back and doggy and it just seemed like it was slipping out often. He finished and we got dressed. 

He is planning to move in 10 months and got out of a relationship 1 month ago. I was fine with a LTR not being the outcome of this connection but I’m not sure if I should try seeing him again after the less than satisfying sex. First time is not always the best. 

He texted yesterday but didn’t ask to make plans

We were talking about my upcoming birthday, because he said he wanted to do something special for me. I suggested the possibility of going to Vegas for a night with a small group of our mutual friends. He responded that was a great idea, and that one of the other guys in the group would probably really like to go to a Vegas strip club - so he would probably dip at the end of the night to go do that with that friend. 

He seemed to genuinely not consider that I would find the guy I’m talking to leaving my birthday party early to go to a strip club offensive… and this is strange to me… because to me this is so obviously offensive haha.  

Maybe making matters worse: I suggested that instead the whole group could drop by a strip club together and he said “no, I wouldn’t want to feel like you’re keeping an eye on me the whole time.”

Curious if any of you have had a similar experience - I matched with a girl on Bumble that was pretty attractive. This isn’t super uncommon for me, as I’m a decent looking guy too. We are the same age (28) and based on first impressions, we’re pretty compatible. That’s to say, she’s not unreasonably attractive or socially beyond me to where there would be some obvious reason she’d change her mind. 

So she opened by asking how my day has been, etc. She quickly followed up with some back and forth banter, then asked if I wanted to talk off the app instead. Normally this would be a catfish red flag, scam, etc. I have a very keen eye for this stuff, and I really don’t think that was the case. In her bio, she mentioned something to the effect of, “I’ve already checked off a lot of boxes on my life goals, just looking for someone to enjoy life with”. Pretty wholesome, and in the range of what I’m looking for as well. 

Anyways, I replied yes, I would like to speak off the app and get to know you better. I also mentioned that her bio is right in line with my goals, which is a good sign. Since that message (3 days ago) I haven’t heard back at all. Of course, she could just be busy, but I doubt it after the initial enthusiasm of her messages and quick reply.

Basically, there's this guy I suddenly like. 
I met him at his workplace. I signed up an activity package with him. That was a few years ago. But that time, I havent like him.

Then we did some activities (it's his work and I'm a customer) together. He treated me kindly.
Then covid happened and I was absent for about a year.
When I came back, I dont expect him to remember me since there are other customers.  So when I had activity again with him, and he asked me a lot of questions  like where have you been all these time,etc. At that time my mood was horrible, remembering a big fight with relative, so being a bit pissed he wss asking questions, I answered shortly.

After that, I kept thinking about it. Why did he remember me and ask questions like that. I thought he had some interest in me. I also felt bad how I replied shortly when he was eager to ask me. So a few months later, I had activity again with him. However when I was refering to the time he chat with me asking those questions , he said he forgot.

That cleared up my misunderstanding. Because it meant he was just curious why i  was absent. After this activity, however, I suddenly realized he had treated me so kindly on everytime we do activity together. 
I noticed on recent few months that he talked to me more softly than to others but maybe because he see me as a soft spoken person. Also I feel like he was so attentive and caring to me.

And then... suddenly I like him. A lot.

The next time I went there again to have the activity but this time not with him. I think he saw me staring at him from across the room. 
After that whenever we crossed paths in the same area he smiled and greeted me.

I'm very inexperienced with this kind of things so I tend to misunderstand. Is he just being friendly? Is he just being kind to me because I'm a customer?
Also, I dont know if he's single.
He has my number but we only chatted about the activity packages, like he's promoting it.

However, when I go to the gym (it is the only moment of the day that I go out, cuz I work with software from home), all I see is couples on the way there, and really attractive girls. I have to admit, I do feel a bit jealous. I moved in this city during quarantine, so I haven’t had the chance to socialize or anything. So ofc, I want to talk to people, get to know others.

But yesterday coming back from gym, it was raining, and it hit me. No matter how much I lose weight, or I build muscle, it will be near impossible to have somebody glance in my direction. I’m only 1.77 m tall. The only moment I forget about this is when i’m lifting weights, or i’m doing my courses.

I graduated in a technical study. Statistically, there weren’t a lot of girls in my bachelor, I’m gonna be honest with you.

The next day when I went in work and saw those same coworkers I immediately felt like I was the popular kid in high school again. That day was fun as well.

I feel so much better than if I continued trying to meet up with this person. I can start to see my confidence going up and my existing friendships becoming more developed. I'm also starting to become less lonely and less angry and upset. Had I continued trying to meet up with this person I don't think my mental health would have lasted much longer.

Got out of a very long relationship, first time using a dating app so while this seems painfully obvious I genuinely don’t know how things work anymore. 

I was on a date with this guy, good food, good drinks, good conversation, we both had fun, and we hooked up (I went down on him) which I usually don’t do on the first date but sometimes it just feels right. He mentioned going somewhere for the second date before the hooking up part. In fact he said while we were hooking up that he doesn’t want me to regret things if we hook up. It’s the next morning and we had a pretty dry conversation that ended with me saying “had fun” and him saying “so did I!” Not sure what to do now. 

My question is what do the men (and others) here think about sex or any sort of sexual activity on the first date?

“You know what they say about tattoo placement?” I randomly came up with…

‘Nooo’

“It’s all about where you can handle pain, but also feel pleasure. Some girls have lower back tats because when they kiss, they want the guy to place his hand at the base of their spine. You put yours here...”

I touch the back of her arm, very soft grab with the tips of my fingers.

‘Whoa’
I freak out for a sec… did I just do that?
‘No… it felt good’ she says.

We learn each other’s names, hometowns, but go out separate ways in the restaurant.

As I’m leaving, there she is standing at the entrance.

I walk up behind and again softly touch the back of her arm.

‘Hi again’ and she says my name.

I asked her “How bad is this tattoo gonna hurt?”

‘I guess you need to get it in a spot you like to be kissed…’

“Well, could you go with me and hold my hand because I’m a baby? Then… we’ll celebrate with dinner afterwards?”

‘I’d love to’

She gave me her IG (I guess Phone Number is too sketchy to give out these days?)

I followed her, she followed me the next morning.

I messaged a kinda cheesy message which I can post in the comments if necessary followed by a second message.

“What does your schedule look like this weekend?”

I think it should be said that I am a man. This all stems from my current job (which I am trying to leave). It's all my co-workers ever talk about. Staring at women's butts, constantly talking about who they'd fuck, saying they don't care how they look just turn the lights off. The standards are so low at my job it makes me want to vomit! Let's talk about something else... Movies, sports, the fucking weather I don't care...

The reason this has gotten so much more annoying is that there is a very sweet girl I currently work with (don't care for the ""don't shit where you eat"" idea cuz I'm hopefully leaving soon). Everyone knows she likes me, and honestly I like her to. But every time she comes around, as soon as she leaves all the guys keep asking ""why haven't you fucked her?"" ""We're not asking you to marry her just fuck her."" I have very high standards, always have. I haven't had a relationship in 4 years because I don't need one to be happy. If I'm going to have sex I want it to be with someone I desire intimacy with. But I know that if it ever got out that I asked her out the questions would only get worse... And at this point I'm not even sure if she wants a relationship or just wants to fuck, she's hinted at it once or twice. But she isn't the first girl they've bugged me about. I'm pretty sure it's just because I'm so picky and reserved that that is all they want in life. For me to become just as horny and sex driven as they are all the time.

I'm an introvert so I don't really like going out much and I work a lot each week so I don't have a ton of friends outside work. But I've asked them to stop, I've told them how much it irritates me and ruins my day when that's all they talk about. But it's the same every day. And unfortunately HR is garbo and won't do anything about it.

Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfterbal. 

After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague

Tl;dr: met this girl a while ago. Thought she was interested but she wasn’t... now its messing me up in future interactions because now i dont know whats just being friendly and whats interest.

I’ve had this friend with benefits for eight years, ever since high school. I met him when I was 16, and he was 18. We’ve hooked up on and off for the last three years. He was in the military, so he moved around a lot, and I didn’t get to see him. Sometimes he would text me when he had a girlfriend, or one time he left me A girlfriend three years ago when I told him I would text him if they were together. 




Six years ago, he said that he wanted sex, and nothing more than two years ago, he said we had a mutually understood sexual relationship. I just never expected anything more from here, and this year, I’ve just gotten depressed, and over the last two years, I’ve just been very depressed. I don’t usually initiate contact with him, so I’ll text him when he contacts me, but I typically don’t start with him. I hooked up with him twice in the last year, but I haven’t seen him in six months because we lived in different states just last week; he was trying to talk to me or FaceTime me but honestly 




I don’t like FaceTime too much, so I made excuses, and we didn’t. I think he was annoyed with me last year he told me to get on Snapchat. I said maybe I would create a new account because I had one when we were younger, and we would go back and forth and text each other. Still, honestly, I just have grown tired just because in the past he’s thrown that like we’re not in a relationship in my face, and I don’t want to make connections or strings attached if it’s an NSA switch situation, so I said maybe and then didn’t make an account, and then we didn’t talk for about eight weeks. 




Last week we talked a little bit, he wanted to FaceTime me, but I didn't want to because he just pressures me  to do sex outside ofwhat I want to do, and I feel so sad have an eating disorder now feel like it would be better if I stop talking to everyone I texted him. I was supposed to visit my family in the state that he lives in the last couple of months but decided that I didn’t see him anymore. I haven’t seen him in six months, and I feel like it would be better if I never spoke to him again. I stop talking to anyone in general. I text him that I didn’t want to talk to him anymore, and then I didn’t like talking to anyone, and I can stop contact with him. I felt forced to speak to him because he would always try to contact me if I wanted to move on I’m. Trying to get him, I told him that I just wanted to be alone in life. I don’t want to speak to him ever again, and that it would just be better if we never talked or hook up with her again. I don’t have any social media, so I’ll never see him again, and I also don’t have any mutual friends with him or live in the same state, so we plan never to see him again. He just texted back, “K.”

What I said rude was what I told hurtfully. I need to find something that makes me happy I want someone who’s a real friend. I don’t understand why he responded the way I try to be nice to him and be not with that much drama when I hook up, but I always feel like you think that I am low class. I don’t know what is wrong with me?

This is not too often, because I am busy with life, but I put effort. When I hit it off with someone and I think we have some rapport, I ask for her number. Having her number I continue talking to her over text or maybe meet in person if we frequent the same places.

But then, that's it. I can go no further than that. When I ask for a date, I get turned down immediately. I have never managed to get even one date. I just don't get it. I just wish I could ask somebody where I'm going wrong.

I mean, I am not doing anything obviously wrong: I am a well adjusted man. I have no self esteem issues. Relatively successful. Not ugly either. I see far worse men who get gfs so I should be able too. I am not shy. I am not a bum. I dress well and have good hygiene. I don't ask out random women, I always get to know them and make sure there is some interest (although I guess I'm not good at that) and I am always acting out of interest myself, not just going after everyone. I don't go out looking for sex. I don't ask for nudes. I ask for a simple first date. I am genuinely interested in a relationship.

Yet it never works out at all. I just don't get it. The furthest I went with a woman, was random ones I met at parties propositioning me for sex, but I had no interest in them and there was really no connection at all.

So I asked her on a date with only a small guess as to what I’d take her to do, which was mini golf since we both expressed interest in it. 

So! I took her to a local mini golf place she’s been to before and it was a little awkward at first since I felt my flirt/convo game was off but that quickly turned around after I figured out how nervous she was as well. 

We finished the game quick so we decided to hit a random bar which happened to be filled with people 20+ our age but after a few beers we were chatting up a storm and I was honestly having such a great time so I didn’t want to stop. 

We then both decided to keep things going and went to a bowling alley to play pool which she’s never done before (she killed it). It was here I actually got to initiate slight physical contact without pushing any limits. 

We have a huge height difference so she stood up on the bar stool to see if she could match my height and in that moment I felt like a kiss was coming my way just by the look in her eyes but we ended up just gazing for a minute and she jumped down. 

I vape so I asked her if she wanted to step out with me and she gladly did. We both had some alcohol in us so I could tell we were both more comfortable and I let her know how much fun I was having and she agreed. She came in for a hug which was unexpected but we did hug when we met and she let me know how nice my cologne smelled. Told her I picked it out just for her (which I did) (felt gangster lmao) 

She then offered to show me the pier near the lake so we could walk to the light house at the end. On the drive one of my favorite songs came on so I turned it up. She held her hand out and my heart started racing. So we held hands till we got there. Ended up walking to the end of the pier holding hands still. I wanted to kiss her because it felt right but I didn’t make the move. 

She unfortunately had to head home so I walked her to her car since the pier is where we met up. She hugged me once and was about to leave but came back in for a second hug. 

I said goodbye but walked back over to her saying “wait!” And I pulled her in for a kiss. Never made a move without asking first but I felt nothing but vibes and comfortable with her. 

Was so nervous that I messed up a second date but she let me know that she almost kissed me too and she’s glad I did. She’s so different to read through text vs in person but I just overthink when I really like someone. 

Hoping to see her Thursday for a movie and hopefully some cuddle action lol. 

Sorry to drag on but these past two months have been so hard to cope with and this girl made ALL my worries and heartache go away. Wish me luck that she says yes!! 🙏🏻🙏🏻

I don't have a lot of confidence about the date and here's why:

I haven't had a date in over 4 years. This girl seems kind of fit and is attractive, and probably dates a lot. I on the other can not get a date easily. Two years ago I asked 15 people on a date during a phase and was rejected each time. Usually when I ask for a girl's number she gives me a fake one. (Happened to me again 3 weeks ago)

I feel like an unattractive replaceable person. I'm not the kind of guy girls like. It doesn't really make sense that a girl would choose me over the hundreds of attractive guys on tinder. I hate to be too real about this but I am suspicious of anyone who goes out of their way to date me. She sent me a message first.

I am also not traditionally masculine. I am not an ""alpha"" and I'm not really interested in acting assertive or ""taking charge"". It simply is not me. While my appearance is masculine, my personality doesn't line up super well with traditional gender roles. I'm afraid this is going to make me look weak when other guys challenge me and I don't respond assertively. Basically I'm not assertive and easily emasculated. I can respond with anger, but I think male competition is obnoxious and I don't like acting like a big man.

I think women tend to like all the stuff about men that I do not like, which is why I can't really get a date.

So I have a date finally this weekend and I am skeptical. I want to cancel just because I don't want to fail. I know I'm not attractive and she is attractive. It doesnt make any sense to me. It isn't a catfish or anything I know from out conversation that she's a real person but the whole thing just seems unreal or bizarre.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,902760,public,self,I have an upcoming date and I feel bad about it for a few reasons.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/om06il/i_have_an_upcoming_date_and_i_feel_bad_about_it/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,

I’ve gone on a handful of first dates, and none of them have been bad or anything, but until my most recent one none of them really led to a connection. This most recent date (a couple days ago) was just awesome though, and we’ve continued to talk since then.
I’d like to ask her on a second date, but since this will be my first time actually moving past the first date, is there any advice you can give me? I’m not sure how long to wait after the first one, and I really don’t want to scare her away. Also, just as a whole is a second date much different from the first vibe-wise?
