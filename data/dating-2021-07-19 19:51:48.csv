We finally met about 2 weeks ago and the date was fantastic. She gave me her number asked for a second date (which was today) however she told me she wasn‚Äôt free until 2 weeks later. In those two weeks she barely spoke to me. Barely replied to me. Showed no interest.
Then today happened. Our second date. We did a fun activity in archery, then took her out for Mexican. We had a nice conversation but I could tell something was off. Date ended and I asked her for a third date. She was honest and told me she‚Äôs been talking to other guys and seeing them too. (Which I figured). But likes my company and would like to see me again.  So I asked her when she would be available and she said she doesn‚Äôt know as she is really busy. (At this point I‚Äôm feeling like a fighting a lost battle) So she offers to play it by ear. I agree. But I just feel like Im ready to move on. I don‚Äôt want to go two weeks of minimal contact. When she never replies back to me since the first date.  She knows I‚Äôm interested in her yet, she doesn‚Äôt show it back.  I feel like I put in effort on my dates to just not be good enough. Am I wrong to move on so easily?

TLDR; date shows no interest in me but wants to see me anyways when she doesn‚Äôt bother replying to anything I say to her by text for weeks.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/onrgj2/second_date_went_sour_what_to_do/

I work in the back and she works in the front so we are distanced but shifts do overlap. We started talking almost immediately after her ex cheated on her (not physically) and we became very close. Talking texting all day talking all night, meeting up whenever we could.  The past two months with her were really enjoyable as somebody with not too many relationships under their belt and I miss having that.

 But she broke things off because she wasn't completely over her ex and wanted to fully emotionally recover before big committing. Sucks but I get it she wasn't all there when we got physical. But nowwww she's reconnecting with her ex and they've hooked up again. 

Here's the problem: she wants to remain friends and obviously that's not happening while she fucks her ex so soon afterwards. I just want to get over her, maybe friends down the road. But I'm reminded of how fucked it all is everytime I see her and it's often. Very hard to get this girl off my mind enough to get over dude.

15,ont7uh,1626748927,Can I save the friendship?,"
Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn‚Äôt interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfterbal. 

After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn‚Äôt get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response‚Ä¶ thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn‚Äôt think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn‚Äôt talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn‚Äôt want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn‚Äôt need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn‚Äôt talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn‚Äôt know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn‚Äôt want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn‚Äôt just tell me she wasn‚Äôt interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn‚Äôt even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird. 

Tl;dr: met this girl a while ago. Thought she was interested but she wasn‚Äôt... now its messing me up in future interactions because now i dont know whats just being friendly and whats interest.

About 2 nights ago, I had some drinks with this girl and all of our friends. (We do share the same circle of friends.)

It‚Äôs good information to know, but it‚Äôs difficult to figure out what to do going forward. Yeah, she might be cautious about jumping into another relationship so quick. But if you like me, i think you should give it a chance. I believe all guys would agree with me on this.

I gave him a change back then, well‚Ä¶. Too many chances. Long story short he was super flaky when I actually put energy into it and started wanted him also. It continued for years. We never met up like he said we was, the ‚Äúplans‚Äù were never actually plans they were just texts, but with no action. I remember following his friend (the one I brought up earlier in the story, and the one this is all about) let‚Äôs call him jusi. I remember following jusi on Instagram after seeing someone post him and he slid in my DMs lol. I was stiff for a little, but then I finally gave him my number. I don‚Äôt remember much from us talking, but it didn‚Äôt work out really I feel like mostly it was a kiddy thing and I had no business even being aloud to date and see him. Jusi came back around this April and basically said he really wants to get to know me more and possibly start something Told him I wasn‚Äôt ready and said. If he could give me some time that would be cool. So I told him I would hit him up when I‚Äôm ready. He would keep in contact basically just ask if I‚Äôm okay every once n again. Until we finally had a conversation after months and he told me he really liked me and had been waiting.I am gonna be honest, I would sometimes call him bae and just play around with him knowing I wasn‚Äôt ready. He told me he can‚Äôt keep chasing me forever and said that we could just be friends. I said ok and we went on about our way, other than him texting me sometimes and I wouldn‚Äôt respond, but in the back of my head he was on my mind a lot. I finally thought I was ready for a relationship and so I texted him asking to talk and he said okay and I told him I felt bad for leading him on and that I wanted to Give him a chance. He said not if I feel bad and I told him I really did like him and so basically over he period of me giving him the chance he wanted to see my apparently and the first time I told him I was getting off at a specific time, 8, and he said he would be somewhere but I didn‚Äôt wanna go so I asked him if I could chill with him before he goes and he said yes, and so basically 8 rolls around and I text him, but no response. This pissed me off being that I got done upto see him. 10:30 rolls around and I‚Äôm already home, and he calls like 4 times after I let it ring and the last two times I hung up on first two rings. I was mad. He accidentally send a voicemail n I heard him with his friends, and so I called him back, but he hung up on the 3rd ring. He later texted me at like 11 something and asked what I was doing and if I could take him to his moms house‚Ä¶ wtf? So I said dtm and he said lol okay nvm bae. So we‚Äôve asked me something and i said didn‚Äôt I tell you not to text me and he was asking what he did and I explained to him that I didn‚Äôt like flaky people and he said he was with (my ex the one earlier in the story) ( is that even considered an ex lol I don‚Äôt know? And said he knows how I am with people in my face ( which is true I don‚Äôt like social interactions like that especially with my ex) so I understood and I told him in the phone answer my texts but in a playful way like boy next time you better let me know and answer. He said okay and basically I was supposed to buy sonethibg from him and see him because he said he wanted tk se that day and he asked where I was and I didn‚Äôt text back till an hour and then he asked me to pull up to a specific place to buy it and and I asked exactly where like send my the adress and he read it and after an hour I said never mind, then I blocked him. I blocked him beCause I felt like I got played. Even though he was very open about how he felt and what happened. Now I‚Äôm wondering if I need to move on or ?

35,onv41n,1626756317,Met a Great Guy this Summer,"I met an amazing guy this summer, but I'm scared to keep seeing him.

We decided to get drinks at a bar around 8 and by the time the night ended, it was 4 am. We met up with two of his friends briefly during the night. Neither of us expected to be out until that late, but we couldn't stop talking about life and getting to know each other. We didn't want the night to end. I've never been on a date that lasted that long.

We hung out again two days later and again, the time was so great. He met my dog at the dog park and then we got a late lunch. I had another commitment, so I had to leave.

One of my good girlfriends said to bring him to our Friday night dinners, so he's coming this week.

That said, I'm terrified to keep seeing this guy because in a month, l'll be going back to college for my senior year. And he just graduated from college this past May. I'm afraid of continuing this guy and falling for him and then feeling so sad when college rolls around in September. I got a full time offer, so I will end up in the same city as him and we do live one block away from each other. It turns out we both own the respective buildings we live in. So even if I stopped seeing him now, I'd probably end up bumping into him at the Duane Reade or subway or Dunkin. And he knows that I still have a year of college left.

Anyways, I don't know if I should keep seeing this guy. It really is unfortunate because the timing is not right. He's a wonderful, incredibly humble guy and I'm scared I'll fall for him really hard when whatever we have right now seemingly has an expiration date of September.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/onv41n/met_a_great_guy_this_summer/

I've been talking/going out with this guy for \~2 months now, and he has been showing a lot of interest (always initiates texting and asking me out on dates). I can tell he's genuinely interested in learning more about me- we engage in deep, thought-provoking conversations every day. We would try texting each other at least once every day- we are both busy and he's a startup founder so his workload is even crazier. 

Last Friday night he sent me a super sexy photo at night (we did this all the time) and I asked when I could see him this weekend. The next morning he replied, ""ASAP, I've been thinking about you. Unlikely this weekend since I'm heads down in finishing the application to this startup accelerator"" and asked if I'm interested in co-working with him from a coffee shop next week. I said I wasn't sure and asked him which day he preferred to meet up.

It's been over 2 days and he hasn't responded. I know he's busy but he has never taken this long to reply, and yet he still watches all of my IG stories.

41,onvncd,1626758633,How long should you give a girl space (not in an exclusive relationship),"I've been on a couple dates with this girl. She's 20 and I'm 23. We would be at the 4 date mark by now but I had to cancel one due to a family emergency. The next cancelled one happened because she actually tested positive for covid and had to quarantine for 2 weeks. 

Our last date was a couple weeks ago. It was great, and was about 6 hours in total. We haven't had sex yet, but we have made out and definitely gotten pretty frisky/hot. She's told me she isn't ready for sex and I totally understand that. 

A few days after our last date, I texted her. I wanted to touch base with her and see how she felt. I felt the need to do this since we have been talking for a little while (2 months) and wanted some clarification. I'm the kinda gut who'd rather speak my mind and be open with communicating versus holding things in. I value communication. 

She told me she wasn't looking for anything serious. I agree, because I'm ready to not commit to something either. I'm working on myself and if she magically texted me tonight saying she wants to date me I'd want to slow down also. I'm just getting to a point where I'm realizing there's potential and I'm getting excited/starting to over analyze and read too far into things. 

I asked her if she wanted to keep things casual and she said she didn't know, but that she wanted to see me again and go on more dates. She followed that response with that she ISNT friendzoning me and wants to keep dating, but doesn't know exactly what she wants. 

I ended it by telling her what we've been doing is great and would like to continue if she did also, in which she said she would love that too. 

I don't remember our communication patterns when we first started talking. We had a period of time where we were texting A LOT, had a long streak on Snapchat, and she would FaceTime me periodically as well. I've never FaceTimed her where I'm The one reaching out first. 

We still snap and text, but we lost our long streak. We text maybe once a week to every 2 weeks. On Snapchat we usually have small/flirty talk. We don't have a streak anymore. 

Lately I feel like I've been making the first move and initiating a lot of it. Last week she hit me up to talk about that show manifest and we ended up talking until almost 2am. 

Yesterday we talked on snap in which I initiated it. She was flirty and responsive and everything was honestly normal. Today I went no contact and she didn't reach out which I was expecting. 

We haven't gone no contact like ever. I feel like i should give her some space. She is traveling every weekend until august 21st. She injured her knee at work and I was initially wanting to plan a hiking date. With her travelling so much these upcoming weekends, I want to aim for a weekday. We talked last week and she said ""we will find time"" when she told me she was going to be gone. 

I was thinking a picnic or something. I don't know yet. In regards to giving her space, if I dont reach out for 3 days or so, that'd be the longest we've gone with no contact. She'd definitely notice the change.  

I want to give her space since I feel like ive been making the first move at least as of lately. If she doesn't reach out in 3 days (she's going to be busy and out and about) I plan on dropping a line and seeing how her trips going.  

After our conversation ended yesterday, she liked my Instagram post I posted that day. She also liked the Tik Tok video I posted today as well.

46,onwcb0,1626761728,"I've (21F) never had a boyfriend, and I'm starting to think it must be me","I did not date much in high school. Two guys that never wanted to actual commit, and a few from Tinder when I was in my final year. EVERYONE in my HS was in a relationship, and I desperately wanted a boyfriend to seem normal. I felt like an unloveable, ugly weirdo.

When I got into college, I was focused on my education and kind of left dating behind me. I'd had so many bad experiences with Tinder LOL, and this time, I met a lot of new friends that were also single. So I didn't feel like a weirdo anymore.   
I had a close friend that I'd met during orientation week, and in a span of a few months, he started asking me to hang out more and more. At first I was kind of hesitant, but when I finally started paying attention to him it was too late... he met another girl in a club and literally fell in love with her.

I met a few guys in my classes after that, but I would always eventually get left on read. Then they would send me something a few days later like they hadn't just ignored me. I would try to make entertaining conversation/talk about something funny and it would be met with neutrality. So I stopped trying. They stopped trying.   
I started to wonder if it was because I don't show enough interest, Was I too indifferent (because I desperately don't want to appear clingy or annoying)?  I've done a few experiments I guess, where I've been super warm/nice/flirty with a guy and it usually ends up the same way. 

A year or two later, I met a guy in class that would comment stuff like ""you've probably got a bunch of frat guys in your dms"" and ""how many guys do you even talk to?"" What a joke. I actually really liked him and it was so obvious, but he never made a move beyond flirting.   
Just recently, however,  he's been suggesting a date. I'm just worried it's just going to go like 'ok let's go to a bar or something' - and then 'ok nice time' - I catch feelings again but then we never talk. 

In fact, this literally happened with a guy I met on a dating app last year. It basically sums up how most of my dates go:  
Usually when I go on dates, guys just naturally give compliments when they first see you. Nothing creepy, just a ""you look great!"" or something.  
When I met up with this guy, he just kind of looked at me. Mind you, every time we'd talked before this he went on about how *stunning* and *gorgeous* I was (way too excessive and suspicious, I'm more 'cute' than anything, not a supermodel). I have pretty bad self-esteem, so I started feeling really insecure. I just kept thinking ""ok he thinks I'm ugly in real life lolol why am I here"". 

As the night went on, the only thing he said was ""it's probably just this angle, but you look nice"". It didn't feel like a compliment to me. 

After the date, he texted me almost immediately that he'd had a lot of fun.   
He called me the next day to say the same thing, but did not suggest another date. My friends kept telling me that was a bad sign and that I had to fall back.  
We were supposed to talk later that week, but literally 10 minutes before, he said 'I'm too busy"", instead suggesting the next day.   
But then the SAME thing happened again. What makes it even worse, was that he *knew* he was going to be busy with work both days; he'd just waited til the last second to tell me that. I don't give a shit if you need to reschedule, but I got ready BOTH days in a row just to hear ""can't today"" 10 minutes before. You can only assume that it's out of disinterest and disrespect!!

Fast forward a month, and he asked to 'hang out'. It was the last straw for me. A whole month of sending memes once a week. At one point, I thought, ok he's sending memes as a way to reach out and spur conversation. So I TRIED, dear reader, I tried! Any stories or conversation starters were literally met with ""Lol"" half the time. There is no way he was interested. So when I got that 'can we hang out' text, I just didn't respond. Never heard from him again.

I guess that's an example of how most of my dates go. The guys I'm not very interested in are always the ones that put in tons of effort to make a second date happen, make an effort to talk to me, etc, but I'm just not attracted to them at all. I often wonder, if I was attracted to them, would it end up going the way it usually does? Downhill? Probably.

It's so frustrating. If I'm being honest, it really hurts my self-esteem and makes me feel so ugly. It's getting to a point where I don't believe anyone can truly love me.

We went out twice ( a week apart) in the beginning but during the third week he asked me what I was up to that weekend, I was busy with another guy and took a long time to reply and just said I'm going to hang out with my friends that weekend. After that he just left me on read. He didn't talk to me for a month after that. And every time we hung out, he would initiate the text a few days later and it was always something relevant to what we talked about in our last hang out. Anyways, after not talking to me for a month he randomly hit me up one day and said hey long time no talk :) and asked if i was down for karaoke with his friends. I already made plans so I said I can't, but that I'd be in his area the following Saturday and he said we can go on a hike. So we went on the hike and it was fun, but I had plans after, I said that he can come join my friend's party after too, but when I got to my friend's party, no one else invited their S/O's so I thought it might be awkward, and told him next time.

After that, our convo ended with him giving me a one word reply, so I didn't bother. He texted me again 10 days later sending me a song about an artist we talked about on our last hang out. He said we should hit up karaoke and I said I was down. He told me he was going to go with his boys and asked me if I'm down to join. I was genuinely busy as I had friends already, but I asked him if he wanted to do something the following day. He said he might be down if he's feeling okay since he would be hungover, so I just told him to lmk. Anyways we started coordinating our plans and we went to the beach. I was kind of disappointed he didnt make any moves on me, but hes also very paranoid about covid.

Since last year we've texted sparingly (maybe once a few months or so). It was on good-terms and I thought I needed to go throw a growing phase in my life. It was a great relationship and enjoyed her family but there were certain things that I thought we're a big deal but just didn't communicate at the time.

Her family comes from a well-off background and my family is pretty middle-class. I never really communicated about how my perception of money maybe different from hers. Also there were also quite a few smaller things that irked me but I never really tried to work it out. All I'm saying is that my communication was shitty and after a year after the break-up those are things I have recognized now.

The thing that kills me is that I should've tried harder and made more effort, I've learned that relationships can take some compromise. This might be the case of ""the one that got away"" but my ex was one of the most sweetest, thoughtful, and endearing women I have known.

50,onx8qj,1626765964,Dating Two Months In and She Deletes the First Social Media Picture of Us - Not Sure How to Interpret Before Discussing,"I apologize in advance, typing this really late at night so there may be typos.

I have been dating a woman off of a dating app for about 2 months now. Things were going well until I started to get some bad signs. Figure I'd share a little bit to see what other perspectives think about this. I plan on asking her about it tomorrow, but figure I'd see if I can get some additional perspectives in the meantime.

&amp;#x200B;

Background

&amp;#x200B;

We're in our late 20's early 30's. She's been single for a few years prior to us dating and only casually dated since then. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things were going very well to kick things off. We deactivated our dating app pretty early on and focused on getting to know each other. We'd speak for hours and wonder where the time went and realized we had a lot in common as we got to know each other. We already planned future ideas for dates with a date jar and talked about making plans for next month.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I appreciate the most about getting to know her is how upfront and open our chemistry is communicating together. We have been able to communicate about anything we've discussed with each other very easily. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to this weekend. We just had our first weekend trip away together and just before we drove out of town she insisted we take a picture together. Afterwards, she asks if she should post it to her Instagram to make it official and I agreed. So she did and we went on our trip and had what I thought was a fun time for the both of us. One thing of potential significance to note is that I had decided to give her a gift I had purchased a few weeks into dating her and was looking for the right time to give her. I decided to give it to her at the last stop of our trip. It wasn't anything lavish or expensive. It was a handcrafted jewelry piece made of clay attached to a leather band from a movie series we both liked. I am not sure if in the general consensus of dating that it's acceptable to give a gift like that after 2 months of dating, but I thought it would be acceptable at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

As I mentioned before, the trip seemed to go well. It wasn't until the ride back towards the end that I did feel things were a little off. I was a bit exhausted from the driving and became quiet. She was quiet too shortly after I was and we sat in mostly silence the last 10-15min or so of the ride back. When we got back to my place where she parked her car she proceeded to put her stuff in and leave. I thought it was a little bit off at the time, but understood we had just been driving and checking things out all weekend and she was probably tired along with me and just wanted to get back home and relax. So I helped put her stuff in her car and said a brief goodbye. I perseverated on it for about 15 minutes after she left and decided to call shortly after just to let her know how I felt. I wanted to see if it was just me or something was off. She replied saying it was because we were both tired and not to worry about it. I agreed with her and we got off the phone.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning, we texted a little bit and had a brief chat while she was on her lunch break today. We texted a little bit tonight and I eventually asked her what her week was looking like for plans and to see if she wanted to meet up later in the week since we didn't make any immediate plans for this week. I didn't get a response as it got later and when I checked back on the text I saw that she read the text, but didn't reply. I figured she was probably wanting to sleep on it before getting back to me since I texted her around her bed time.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended opening up Instagram later in the evening. I checked her profile out and noticed that the selfie of us she put up there two days ago was taken down but the album of pictures she took from our trip without us was still on her profile. I found this surprising because she kept commenting how well we looked in the photo all weekend. When putting the missing photo and the lack of response and leaving it through the night together, it makes me believe that she's probably looking for a way to tell me she's no longer interested.

&amp;#x200B;

The only other alternative I can think of is that she's still into me but might have felt it was too soon to throw us out there and make it official and she has some hesitations. 

&amp;#x200B;

Either way, it's not a good sign. Figure I'd put this out there and see if anyone else ran into a similar situation or has a perspective to share on this.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, is discussing this upfront the best idea? I mean, it does seem kind of petty to bring up something like this up. But because it is so early in the dating game when we're not official yet it, it shows as an obvious bad sign. I just won't know truly how bad of a sign it is until we discuss it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/onx8qj/dating_two_months_in_and_she_deletes_the_first/

He said it was really chilled out and they rented a massive villa to themselves. He did mention it was a big villa so some people came by and they made friends with guys. 

However, I was on Instagram and a page was suggested to me. It was a an influencer type girl who he recently followed. I was curious and had a browse and she had several pics of her over the course of a few days in the same villa as the guys. They had small parties by the looks of things. She obviously got on well enough with my boyfriend for him to be adding her. 

I‚Äôm so upset because I thought he‚Äôd at least mention it in passing. And he told me it was a chilled holiday but really he was partying it up with other women. I could‚Äôve gone if I knew it were a mixed group thing, or even some of his friends fianc√©es/wives. 

But what I‚Äôm most livid about is the fact that he felt the need to add a hot half-naked girl on social media who he‚Äôs only known for two seconds when he has a girlfriend at home. I understand when you‚Äôre on holiday you‚Äôll mingle and talk to others (that‚Äôs fine), but I don‚Äôt get why you‚Äôd give them your number or social media when you‚Äôre in a relationship.

I‚Äôm going to speak to him but just wanted to vent as I‚Äôm really confused and hurt right now.

After this date we had a few days chat-break because she didn't know when she would drive to holiday with her brother. But this doesn't matter.
The problem is she told me that she don't see a future with me.
I asked her why she thinks that and it turns out that the problem is not that we have some (not that much) different point of views, as i thought at the beginning.
She told me that she just wants to end it, because she is currently not feeling in a romantic way as i do.
And this is true. I had the feeling that there were sparks. I also had the feeling though that ther were also some on her side.

When I asked her she also told me that she really likes to be with me and everything else is pretty good.
It sounds like its just the reason because she didn't have the same feelings as i do currently.

In my mind it is quite normal that one side sometimes feels something a bit earlier as the other side. And therefor I won't like to end this, just because of that.
And this is also something I wrote her and because she is working and can't write messages in work, i wait for her answer.

I also had the feeling that she could be a bit afraid to bind, if you know what I mean. In her past she made a traumatic experience, what is actually worked out but maybe its still a offshoot. Idk

So, I matched with a guy on tinder in March but he haven‚Äôt met till 10 days ago. Something would always come up, and he wouldn‚Äôt follow through. 
10 days ago, we talked and met. I was  drunk which is terrible, and I tried to initiate sex.. Can‚Äôt handle alcohol well I guess. I mean I wasn‚Äôt obviously drunk but normally I wouldn‚Äôt initiate it. He had a drink or two too. It was July 10th.
He didn‚Äôt have sex with me. We made out and talked for 7 hours.
The next day I apologized but he said ‚ÄúI enjoy your company so let‚Äôs hang out‚Äù.

71,onzhrc,1626777322,Was I an unaware rebound or was she not into me? Is there anything to do?,"Hi,  

I (m27) started dating a girl (f25) for about 1.5 months, we met on Tinder. We really really hit it off on the first date, had a great connection, and  had a brief kiss before saying goodye. She messaged me right after, we set up a 2nd date which was great as well, and ended up having a great time and having sex.

I got her number and and initated first few dates after and then not texting a lot more. She did however start to text me more and more and send goodmorning and goodnight-texts with kiss emojis etc and ended up initiating the texting and basically ""keeping the conversations going"" even though I wasnt giving short answers. Other than that on both the dates and through texting we seemed to be into eachother. She also started to initiate some of the dates. 

We kept on seeing eachother about 1-2 times per week and hangout both outdoor and indoor and were physical all the time and seemed to have a good connection.

We spoke a bit about past relationships, mainly if we've traveled somewhere etc and her latest real LTR (that I knew of at that time) ended 3 years ago.

Since we've both been working and seeing eachother on weekdays we didnt sleep together until last week, about 1.5 months in. She had previously shared some older dramatic experiences, about 10 years ago and well, we got into the subject and I told her about a death in the family that happened a few years ago etc and how that period was rough but it ended up making me a better, stronger person. Around that time I also found out she had broken up with a guy she was together with for 8 months, and we had our first date one month after. She didnt want to discuss it too much but told me she was over him and all they did was fight. Im quite a calm and generally nice, but firm guy, so she told me im nothing like him. Which I found strange and potentially a red flag. I found out his name and later that evening when she was gonna show me something on her phone I saw that she had top search results for him. I felt a bit decieved since this was new information, all of it. I also recalled her one time, when we said goodbye, answering a text (I wasnt snooping but saw the screen) and recalled that same name. I should have confronted her, because she saw that I reacted to something, but I thought I would let it go and and felt that if it still bothered me later I would talk to her about it.

Anyway we spent the night together and it was all good. Before that date she had already asked if I wanted to do a daytrip during the weekend that was coming, and we had made plans. However during the week after when we had contact, she seemed less interested, stopped the goodmorning texts etc and the kiss emojis, but was still the one keeping the conversations going and texted me. I had during that week decided that I was gonna talk to her about the recent ex and had basically set myself up to potentially break things of when we met.

Four hours before were gonna meet she texts me, apologizes several times, cancels the date and tells me that it doesnt feel right and that she feels something is missing. She tells me im a greay guy, awesome, kind and funny and that our dates have been really great. She tells me she wants it to work but that she is not 100% sure. She also then mentions that her previous breakup still affects her. I reply that its a shame to hear, but I had a feeling about it. I then also tell her its been nice, that shes is a nice person and then wish her all the best. She dont reply to that and we've had to contact since.

Afterwards I saw that her recent ex had posted on social media, about 20min before she texted me, an image with some girl and a description that can be interpreted as a hint.

I feel like theres some mixed signals here, but maybe im just not thinking straight. What do you people of reddit think? Was she just realising shes not that into me? Was I just a rebound? Seems she wasnt over her ex maybe? Or was the family trauma I tell her about ""too much"" to share? And, against my better judgement, should I try to reach out after a few months? I would never do under normal circumstances, I usually walk. But... compared to a few others Ive dated I felt like we had a really good connection.

77,oo0647,1626780348,I‚Äôve been so wrong about dating cis men as a cis woman,"I just came to a realization, after yet another relationship where I was not a good fit for them, that‚Äôs always been me the problem.

This is the 4th relationship where I‚Äôm treated as not enough for different reasons. And I always blamed it on the guys. Like, I am smart, cute, independent and mature (or that‚Äôs what thought). Why can‚Äôt they just see that? Why do I have to prove myself and yet never be enough? 

I used to be really angry at them and hope they would see back in time the big mistake they did by mistreating me and losing me eventually. But now I see I WAS THE PROBLEM ALL THIS TIME. And not with them but with MYSELF. 

Why did I put them in such pedestal? Why did I have such big expectations for them (but such low standards for me)? Why would I justify their actions? Why would I be scared to say what I truly wanted and needed? Why would I rather be somewhere that made me feel inadequate rather than alone? 

Because I felt like I always have something to prove, because I wanted validation, because these men excelled in their professional life and I mistook that as an adult that knows what they want in life. WROOOOONG don‚Äôt let their successful careers fool you. I settled for two that couldn‚Äôt forget their ex but wanted my company (took me a long time to accept they were using me), one that cheated on me and one that was embarrassed of me being his ex student in college. And just as them, there are MILLIONS of emotionally unavailable men and that HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU. 

In my case, I was attracted to them because their professional success somehow meant to me that was a ‚Äúvalidation card‚Äù. As if they were qualified to validate who I am as a person. They have such credentials in other areas, don‚Äôt they? Also, I realized I was begging for such validation because my own father abandoned me without saying goodbye even though we were really close. I, for a long time, felt I was inadequate, incomplete, because not even my father could see the brightness in me. I had expectations for him, but my father was not only a parent, he was a sick man in other aspects of his life and I was just one of the victims, to call it somehow.


Getting back to it, what‚Äôs the freaking point of dating someone smart, handsome, funny, polite, successful, if their company makes you feel inadequate, not enough, with self doubts? No amount of good assets could ever be enough to make that feeling of worthlessness be ok. And they are not in the wrong, we are if we already know and yet decide to put up with it, stay with them and EXPECT a change. 

THE FUTURE IS UNCERTAIN. Expectations are set up in the future, not the present. Take what the present is telling you and realize he is the one deciding for both of you, not you. The moment you decide for both is when you put yourself first and realize he is not that worthy.

No person is THAT special. Believe me, no one. Let‚Äôs be responsible of our lives and be held accountable for when we are putting expectations and idealizing someone.

* She doesn't accept it if its her fault/mistake or rather never realizes it or her actions. She never apologizes (i don't want apologies, i just want her to understand/realize her own actions) But when i try to make her understand, she goes 100% into denial and turns it on me.
* She says hurtful things when she is mad, looses control over her anger/emotions and says later that i was just venting shit out. (in these cases, apologizes but idk) so when she vents shit out, she can excuse herself, but if i ever get angry, i need to calm myself down? what joke is this?
* She is a pampered child, brought up in a very soft environment. Immature most of the times and oblivious to most things in the world. Do pampered kids ever grow up?
* recent incidence where i didn't text her back for 4 hours, only later when i did, she says, ""now you remember me"" (point is i have had serious discussions with her wrt to texting that if i am not able to reply you back in some time or by eod, its ok and the sky doesn't come falling down without me. its ok when people dont text back whatever the reason maybe, i am sure if i dont text back there must be a good reason behind it) it seems she has completely forgotten our serious discussions about this.

Being a fair person, i don't want anyone to think from just my perspective. I shall answer any question which you may think relevant to my issue here.

TLDR: Since my 3 year relationship, I have positively changed myself at my SO's requests but she hasn't changed much, just a point or two here and there.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oo0icx/is_my_so_toxic_af/
80,oo0k7w,1626782025,Should I date someone 10 years older?,"Bit of background info, I (21F) met this guy (31M) on a dating app (lets call him Ben) and we‚Äôve been messaging back and forth for about a week. I‚Äôve had a few bad relationships and decided that in my next relationship I‚Äôm gonna try my best to make it last forever so I really wanted to find someone else who is also looking to settle down. 

My friends think I‚Äôm crazy for even considering this guy and that the age gap is too big and they think he‚Äôs a total creep for trying to date someone who is only 22 (they pretty much called him a groomer) 

The conversations between me and Ben have been pretty standard and I‚Äôve enjoyed getting to know him. There were a few times where he tried to talk about sex and I shut it down because I was uncomfortable, he never apologised for anything he just said that he didn‚Äôt realise it would be a problem so I said let‚Äôs forget about it and we left it at that. 

I‚Äôm supposed to go on a date with him for the first time this weekend but my friends keep telling me I should back out.

83,oo0zug,1626783802,Guy I was talking to went complete radio silence?,"Hey guys,

I had been talking to this guy for a while, we had gotten together on a few occasions and are in an environment where we have to see each other pretty regularly. He hasn't been in a relationship for a while and after we started hooking up he was saying that he actually really liked me/felt different towards me than he has for other girls etc. We were texting regularly as we can't meet in lockdown and it all seemed fine, he was initiating etc, but all of a sudden he went radio silence on me. He did this once before and when I asked him about it he seemed confused and had no idea that he had come across as such and said he'd put in a better effort. I just have no idea what has happened. I dont expect to be texting 24/7 but its just that he has been the one to initiate the whole situation and was the one to begin messaging me a bunch, and now has just stopped. Like literally we were talking constantly for a while and then one day I sent him a msg and never got a response. I haven't tried to reach out because I already have in the previous situation, but I'm just so confused as he acted so interested and then all of a sudden nothing. Additionally, I had to cancel plans with him on the day that he stopped sending me a message (I cancelled the day before) so it just seems so out of the blue.

94,oo3anv,1626791860,Controversial Advice: Don‚Äôt be TOO picky,"Nobody wants to hear this. You want to be told that you have to date 100+ people before you find the right one so keep your options open. I say, that‚Äôs a recipe for disaster, and you WILL end up alone. First of all, the secret to finding something is to stop looking so hard. When you go on these dates, go with the mindset that you‚Äôre just having fun with someone new. Not trying to make them your boyfriend/girlfriend‚Ä¶just have a good time. Smile, laugh, and vibe with one another, that‚Äôs it! 

The paradox of choice is a real thing and this may be feeding into why you can‚Äôt find anybody short or long term. You think you‚Äôll never run out of options so you‚Äôll just keep swiping, and keep dating until the chicken comes home roost. Trust me, I‚Äôve done this and I can tell you that you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time. 

Our parents did not have all the options that we currently had, and most of them somehow were able to find someone to stay with for years. Yes they didn‚Äôt all work out but so what? Atleast they took the risk and made it work for a while. Dating requires you to accept the other persons flaws and still love them anyways, because guess what?

96,oo3fq7,1626792310,‚ÄúThis just happens to me‚Äù,"I (26f) was seeing a guy (32m) who I had really strong feelings for, while we only dated a couple of months, it‚Äôs really felt like it was going somewhere. We had chemistry, physically and emotionally. It was the first time in years where I honestly felt there was a good healthy start to something.

It was our last date where right before he texted me and told me he wanted to end it early (I was originally supposed to stay over) and while the date in itself was fine that night, on my way home I cried because I felt him push himself away from me that last week/date.

When I asked what was wrong, we ended up meeting up and he said that this happens to him where he just loses feeling almost instantly. I felt honestly crushed that day. I didn‚Äôt know what to say, he offered friendship but it felt like it was out of pity and I said no.

I decided to write him a letter a few days later which essentially was just a description of how I had come to care for him and that I still felt a connection. That I hoped he cared for himself and that maybe we could try again. He never responded but followed me on social media and continued to like thing/respond to my stories which made me feel really weird. I messaged him a few weeks later to say I need to cut off all contact and that I wished him the best. His response was that he felt not replying to my letter was the best reply and that really sucked.

I felt really hurt by his actions and I couldn‚Äôt understand what went wrong. I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that even though he said he wanted a relationship, he seems scared of them. I think the worst part is I can‚Äôt seem to stop thinking about him and I don‚Äôt know why. I think about it constantly and can‚Äôt help but feel pathetic in this whole situation. Especially because I can‚Äôt help but wonder if he really only was seeing me to sleep with me.

99,oo3jhr,1626792637,She changed 360 degree after I become a better good looking man,"Hello guys,

Here is my story and it has opened my eyes to the importance of appareance.

This girl I was madly in love with, we have worked in the same place together and I have developed a strong connection with her.

I told her about my feelings and she said she is not ready for any relationship... 

I went to study abroad, and when I came back to my home country after 6 months to see my family ( I was still a student) I told her if she wanted to meet with me to hangout..and share a good time together... 

She said yes, and we meet.

SHE WAS SO COLD / RUDE / ARROGANT with me.

1st - She didn't wanna take anything when we sat down in a coffee shop, not even a cup coffee. 

2d - From her behaviour, I felt that she was looking down at me

3d - After 20 minutes, she wanted to go, yet I was so respectful / gentle with her. 

4th - She was walking very distant from me

5th - Didn't want me to accompany her to her place ( we are living in a ""3rd word"" country, there are many theifs, bad people especially at night / that's why I wanted to walk with her a little bit so that she can reach her home safely and she knows that)... 

Anyway, I was very MAD, I said to my self SHE IS NOT WORTH IT. 

I felt miserable, I didn't know what's wrong.. 

I'm a very educated individual, very smart and as far as I know I'm a decent looking dude... 

Anyway, after few hours of our meeting, she sent me a text saying that she was happy meeting me with some hearts and kisses.... 

I REALLY DISLIKED her after what she did, and I become very cold with her because frankly I lost ALL feelings I had for her after that meeting... 

After 1 year and a half, THINGS CHANGED. 

I was working out 5 times a week, eating healthy and got in a very good shape (I'm 1m78) 

When I say a very good shape, I MEAN a VERY GOOD Shape. 

It was clear to everyone that I have a nice body and that I was taking care of my self. 

I was looking strong and lean. 

Anyway, I've meet that same girl and her behaviour changed DRASTICALLY in compare to her behavior when I met her last year... 

1 - she was laughing at everything I say
2 - we sat down for about 1.5 hours (20 min last year) 
3 - she asked me to have a walk together, and she was walking very close to me (touching my skin etc...) and at one moment she hold my hands like a freaking couple and she was VERY HAPPY. 

And said after our meeting that she missed me SO MUCH and wanted to meet again before returning... 

Anyway, I will never forget how she treated me the 1st time we met.

Do you think that kind of girl can make a good wife? Because I don't believe so. Anyway, We are both 26 years old.

Thanks",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oo3jhr/she_changed_360_degree_after_i_become_a_better/
