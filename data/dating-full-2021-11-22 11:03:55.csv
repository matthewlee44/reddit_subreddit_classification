Anyway, it was super intense and passionate and quickly led to sex. She spent the night at my place and it was an amazing time- I was on cloud 9.

Well, half an hour after she left this morning (we had sex again right before she left) she texted me saying that we probably shouldn’t have done that, and that she was still messed up over the last guy and she “needs time.” She also said her feelings for me come and go.

This post is definitely not directed at native English speakers, you won't relate, sorry ahah.

So, I (21F) recently started dating a person from another language and we both communicate in English with each other (which isn't any of ours first language). We are both good at English, so there isn't that much of a language barrier, but I've been noticing some funny things that I would like to know if y'all relate with.

First of all, flirting in English makes me feel like im in an American movie. Because every time I see movies or shows or listen to music, it's always English/American and, therefore, it's a very weird experience to be living it. Just listening to someone saying ""you're beautiful"" or ""I like you a lot"" is such an odd experience for a non-native speaker haha. The same with the ""I love you"" (we are def not there yet, but I feel like it will be very meta for me if we get there haha).

Another thing that looks like in the movies is having sex. All the expressions I am so used to seeing in the movies are all of a sudden used in bed and it's so weird for me. The whole ""im gonna cum"" in English makes me feel like im in a porn movie and the first time the guy said it to me, I just wanted to laugh (he found it funny when I told him afterwards haha). 

And finally, the best thing is that I feel SO MORE COMFORTABLE flirting in English than in my native language. I suck at telling someone how I feel (even if it's my friends or family) and in English is so much easier. I guess it's because Im used to listening/reading English flirting (even in posts on Reddit or Instagram, for example) and because the European culture is so focused on American entertainment it just seems more natural.

In conclusion, these are some small things Ive been noticing and thought someone might relate.

Let me preface this by saying, I was married for a long time. I’m not good at dating.  I’ve tried over the last few years and had one relationship that was toxic, and a few dates that ended in getting too physical the first date.  I just got on apps after two years of focusing on my career and being a single mom.  I’ve had a couple of dates in the last couple of months. One got physical and I haven’t talked to him since.  Which I’m fine with.  

Fast forward to Saturday night.  I decided I wanted to not let it get physical and take it slow and get to know someone.  He came out to see me (about 45 min away).  We had some drinks and walked around the downtown area near my home. It’s a busy area on weekends. We had good conversation. Agreed on a lot politically and honestly he seemed mature for his age.  It was really refreshing compared to other men I’ve gone out with.  At the end of the date we were near my car.  He offered to walk me to it but I declined saying if was fine because it was just across the street.  He pulled me in to kiss me and I did kiss him back but it was a long peck of that makes sense.  We parted ways and I texted him to let me know when he got home. 

He texted me when he did and I thanked him for letting me know and I also thanked him and told him I had a nice time. I never heard anything back all day the next day.  I was sure I’d get a text back of some sort.  I honestly felt so good after the date.  We’re matched on the app still.  I ended up texting him last night letting him know I really did have a good time and am interested in seeing him again.  That was later so I dont expect a response just yet.  My friend was perplexed about him not texting when I told her.  

Im such an over thinker and I hate it! Lol.  I just wanted to take this one slow.  Maybe he was expecting more? Maybe it’s age? He didn’t seem bothered by it and we briefly mentioned the age difference.

New user here, my first post so please excuse me if I’m breaking any rules. This text maybe very huge but I have no one who’ll give me legit advice. Me and my bf are both 25. We’ve been dating for 2.5 years now. We come from post soviet country just so you can get a rough idea that here people usually live with their parents until they get married or get super rich to buy their own house. 

A little intro of the bf family: so his parents have been together since they’ve been young and worked hard to build their house and family business. My bf’s mom was hated bye her MIL but her husband was very supportive in the process and had cut contact with his mother to accommodate his wife. My bf was their first born and he has little sister which is now 19. They had lots of money back in the day used to go to luxury trips every month all around the world but lost that income and now only have their family bakery and one apartment (which is next to their house and me and my bf spent most of our time there unless it’s rented out) they rent out. Both husband (60) and wife (55) aren’t working and spend everyday at house don’t go out at all unless their friends call them for get together.

Family positions: I’m very close to my bfs sister and she explained that in the house mother and father are always in conflict with her nagging of not having enough money and than him swearing at her. Daughter and dad are usually on the same team and mother and son on the other. Mother always criticizes her friends and they conflicts over that with mother swearing at her in front of her friends. Even sister’s friend warned me that their mother was a very jealous person.
Fast forward to our relationship and her interference chronologically: 

- when we first started dating we used to spend time in the apartment and his mom used to call hundreds of times and he wasn’t really answering her calls she used to send over their neighbors to tell him to call his mom? When she knew where he was and with who, she didn’t care about her son’s reputation at all. Happened three times, he got angry and it was resolved with her apologizing and stupid reason explaining before he went to sleep.

- she texted my bf telling him to make him money cause she wants new house, villa and better life to show off to their rich friends and when is he going to get a promotion cause she cannot live like this anymore.

- i know from my observation that before she used to be jealous of my bf’s childhood friends, than his other best friend and now she hates me cause he spends more time with  me than with her. My bf loves being outside since he was 12 he never really liked being at home unless they had family vacation or outing. He loves his family to death but really loves being with his friends. 

- we wanted to spend Christmas together at their apartment I was there with him and his mom wouldn’t stop calling him since 11pm telling him to go over to celebrate Christmas with his family first. I told him to go because it was just so annoying and met Christmas alone waited for him almost two hours to come back.

-Every time me and my bf go out she calls him thousands time and texts him asking if he’s going back home that night or not and if not she starts her manipulative drama that he never sleeps at home etc.

-Whenever she had fight with her husband she texts my bf saying that his father is a dick and she’ll leave this family and move to states with her sister and wants my bf to go with her, she couldn’t care less for her daughter though since she studies in NY and will meet up anyway or wtv.

-She never asks him about me she pretends I don’t exist and that I’m only temporary, doesn’t make comments to any of my presents for bf while the father really likes me and we know each other and he treats me very good

-She always humiliates her husband like for ex. My bf asked if they wanted to go to a cafe (just three of them) and she answered that who cares about that dick (her husband) we can just go together. She always tries to do that and tries to be some kind of matriarch and power pole in the family and you are either with her or her enemy.

-Whenever my bf isn’t behaving the way she wants to she starts calling him names and guilt trips to never call her mother again and that he can fuck off literally 

-She has this obsession to show off how much her son loves her and how successful he is and how treats her. One time it coincided that me and my bf and our friends were on a vacation and his parents and sister were in another hotel but the same city. Bf’s mother’s friend was also there with her kids (25+) and she blew up my bf’s phone asking him to be on their dinner and ditch us. I got annoyed again and I’m very laid back so I told him to just go to avoid her cussing.

-If me and my bf spend more than one night together she texts him stuff like does that girl not have a home or family how long does she plan on staying there with you? Which my bf just ignores as he’s a bit of a coward and would rather ignore her then get into a conflict and the same pattern of her speech that nobody appreciates her and that she’s such a victim.

-Now that she cannot ignore the fact that me and my bf aren’t temporary she’s losing it and has become more verbal with her dislike. Just a month ago my bf was away from town due to work and couldn’t answer her calls and she texted him saying that: he doesn’t remember her at all, she became a stranger to him. I have replaced everyone and everything for him. And maybe that’s how it’s supposed to be and that’s such a pity. Manipulative and victimized? Very much. I wasn’t even there he was just busy why blame me???

-And now the last straw was two days ago me and my bf were staying the night together, from what I saw maybe he said something about moving out cause we don’t have anywhere to sleep now since the apartment is rented long term, and she send this long text to him: 
you are very worried that no one from your circle lives with their family except you now. Just go and be where you want to, you grew up to become one unappreciative man, you can’t appreciate nor love nor relationship. Be where and with whom you’re happy. WE WON’T be TOGETHER IN THE END ANYWAY (what is she a mother or his ex wife the fuck???). 
I’ll never get used/acknowledge to that woman (she never calls me by my name and I’m a woman and her same age son is a toddler or what??). You only have 10 minutes communication left with me, that woman (me his gf) replaced everyone and everything in your life.  Have her I don’t give a fuck, never mention my name again and never mention her (my) name again in front of me. That’s it my patience has it’s limit too.

-So this text has so many red flags I really think she needs a psychiatrist she neglects her husband and daughter and is super clingy only towards my bf and wants him to get rich and spend his money on his mother so she can show off. Gets possessive and jealous towards anyone my bf spends time with. Always puts him down. She raised him in a way that my bf always looks up to “manly stuff” and men’s recognition because his mother just left out the father from his life even though they are married. He hasn’t developed skills which are necessary for independence and during this 2 years I’ve helped him get through all of that and now that he was getting better with small steps since he trusts me and saw himself whatever I’ve advised him turned out be true he really paid attention to  my help, and now she’s started this psycho stuff.

- also when I first met his sister their mom texted my bf asking why was he behaving like a family man? Like she really wanted to think of me like I was more like temporary relationship so why meet with his little sister. Joke’s on her his sister treats me more like a family than any of them. Though she has no idea about any of these.

In conclusion: a lot of people in my country and around me had to go through drama due to their MILs and I have lots of problems and am very independent and don’t want to get involved with some mental woman which most probably will get worse. So the only solution I came up with was to somehow convince my bf to go to psychologist. I don’t know how yet, most probably will tell him during some heart to heart conversation that his company is getting bigger and he needs to have strong mental health to grow bigger and take responsibility for his work and visit a psychologist which will help him grow and build his identity. And also have convince him not to say anything to his family about the psychologist if I somehow convince him.
Honestly when I first read her text I thought that she was completely crazy and wanted to break up with him on spot BUT I really do love him and since he realized in his heart too that she was too much maybe there’s a chance that he’ll change positively and become a grown up who can protect his privacy and set healthy boundaries without feeling guilty.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1128691,public,self,Me(25) and my bf(25) and his crazy clingy mom?

Okay to make things less confusing I'm going to use fake names otherwise I'll confuse myself too. Okay so my flatmate, Alice, met this guy on a night out called Eric. They have been friends for a few weeks and they talk a lot. I sometimes tease her asking if they will ever get together but she always told me they were just friends that's all she felt about him. I have also hung out with him since we go walks a bit so we have talked. Alice and Eric also tried to set me up with one of his friends like three days before this. Then one day he messages me and asks if I want to go on a walk sometimes just the two of us. I was a little confused but I said sure. We went on the walk and ended coming back to my flat and I cooked food. We hung out for like 6 hours and it was kinda fun.

The next night he comes over and we drink - a lot. I remember most of what happened and we ended up making out for a bit and he was saying how pretty I am and how he wanted us to date and not see anyone else. I didn't want to do anything while I was drunk so I sent him home. Cut to the next day, we call for like an hour in which I told him all that happened to see if he remembered too. I told him I didn't want to be in a serious relationship right now and he did. I only just met the guy I didn't want to get into anything right now. I told him I don't have feelings for him right now but it could change, he went kinda quiet when I said that. I said let's just hang out and get to know each other more before we go further which he agreed to.

Everything seems kinda normal up to now right? Well Alice was actually away for the weekend so when she came back I obviously had to tell her what happened. (btw I did ask her if it would be okay if me and Eric hung out as just us which she said go for it). So I tell her what happened and then she tells me Eric asked her to be his girlfriend a few days ago - and she said yes. But the next day he came back and said I don't want to ruin our friendship so let's just be friends which is the same day he asked to hang out with me. TBC...

This is a very new situation to me and I’m not entirely sure how to handle it. I met this person on bumble in august of 2020, she’s a few years younger than me, let’s call her B. The first time we hungout, she came over to my place and it was supposed to be a hookup. I’m not super proud to admit but I’ve had countless hookups in my life and they’re always a one or 2 time thing. So naturally that’s what this was gonna be. We had amazing sex to say the least so we continued that. During the 4th or 5th time while having sex, something definitely changed, it felt more than just a hookup. 

So from that point on we got closer, we’d hangout and do other things besides just sex. However I did not want a relationship with her and I was very upfront about it. She would bring it up on occasion but she never made a huge deal out of it. It wasn’t bc I was scared or anything like that, I just personally have very high standards for a relationship (only been in 2 in my life), I take them very seriously. My last relationship I made the mistake of jumping into it thinking I’d develop feelings for her over time. I knew deep down I didn’t feel that strongly about her but against my better judgement I continued. Anyways it became a very toxic relationship and I was a very shitty boyfriend. It was a 3yr relationship and ended 5 years ago. Since then I told myself I’d never enter a relationship unless I felt 100% sure and felt ‘right’. So naturally I didn’t want that to happen with B, I really did like her as a friend and enjoyed our time together but I didn’t see her as more, all of which I communicated to her

So anyways our FWB continued, we had the agreement that we can do things with other people but there was no need to tell each other about it. Only if we met someone and it started to become serious that we would tell each other. Which was all good, wouldn’t be fair to hold each other down. Back in like may or June of this year I saw an IG story of her with another guy which bothered me more than I thought it would. It upset me that she posted it knowing I’d see it, anyways we talked about it and I ended up being fine they weren’t anything serious or whatever 

So our thing still continued. But over the last few weeks or so I’ve started to feel very different about her. I’ve been missing her more, wishing we could hangout more, overthinking things a bit (the usual feelings when you like someone). This past Friday I went on a date with someone else, I’ve hungout with the person before she’s cool but that’s about it. After we finished dinner, the date ended. And I couldn’t help but think about B, we haven’t seen each other ina few weeks and I really missed her. She can be very busy with work so I wasn’t expecting her to be around, but she was and I went over to her place and we were so happy to see each other. While laying in bed together I decided to open up to her and let her know how I’ve been feeling. Opening up for me is not easy so it wasn’t super comfortable tbh. I didn’t know what she was gonna say but she said she felt the same way which made me very happy. So we talked and decided there’s no need to rush into anything, let’s just start hanging out more doing more things together and see how it plays out

I have a few potential concerns though. I have a therapist and I told her about this too. But I wanna make sure this isn’t a temporary feeling bc I’m very scared to hurt someone else again preemptively jumping into something. So taking it slow with B is in our best interest. Another concern, I’ve been sober for almost 2 years. But B smokes marijuana, she of course knows I’m sober and has been very respectful. She never smokes around me. She also likes going to festivals which I cannot go to for obvious reasons. I have no problem dating someone that has a drink here and there, or someone that even smokes weed (depending on their relationship with it). Im just scared that she’s gonna resent that I can’t smoke with her or go to festivals, down the road. I don’t want it being a future wedge between us

Anyways any opinions or thoughts on this would be appreciated. Maybe I’m overthinking things, maybe no situation is ever perfect and I’m setting too high standards. Maybe I just need to give it time

Having your personal space in constant disarray reinforces an immature and inadequate frame of energy.

Being organized won’t compensate for poor social skills or sloppy personal appearance, but it sets a baseline of independent, attractive behavior that translates into other areas of life. More importantly, the mental health benefits of being organized and having ownership of your life can’t be understated.

This doesn’t mean you have to live in an immaculate surrounding. There are some simple activities that will provide a sense of organization and improve the energy in your place:

Make your bed first thing in the morning. If you currently aren’t in the bed making camp, I highly encourage you to try it for a week. Even if the rest of your place is somewhat disorganized, a made bed still provides a sense of order amid the chaos. The few minutes you spend making your bed can be one of the best investments of time you make throughout your day

Clean your toilets every other day. This can be a tedious and sometimes unpleasant task, but it doesn’t take a large amount of time to spray in cleaner, scrub with a brush, and wipe underneath the seat with a Clorox wipe. It’s also a gigantic turnoff if you have someone over and there are bits of dookie stuck to the side of your toilet bowl

Don’t let dishes and laundry pile up. I loathe folding laundry, but I find myself getting caught behind sometimes if it gets neglected, and it can contribute greatly to sense of disorganization in my place. Wash, dry, and fold laundry the same day. Watch TV or listen to music so it’s not as tedious. Cleaning dishes completely after every meal, even if it’s a pain in the ass. The kitchen is one of the focal points in the home; if the place where you prepare your food. If the kitchen is dirty and unorganized, it provides a sense of discomfort and general uncleanliness

Put away your shit. Don’t let shoes or other articles of clothing, or gym bags get strewn across your place. Put them in a designated area. If you have a workspace or place for hobbies, organize in a way that is clean, but allows you to be comfortable and creative",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1128708,public,self,Having your shit together - keeping your place clean and organized is an important component of feeling attractive,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qzpzct/having_your_shit_together_keeping_your_place/,no_ads,0.0,

Its the first both of us have dated since we each went through rough breakups in the early months of this year, and so far everything has been going pretty dang well. I haven't dated many girls who I connect with at the level I have with her so far, and she feels the same.

However one thing that's kind of been bugging me is that we'll frequently spend an evening at her place - usually making dinner or watching TV after going out, and sometimes having sex - but then when it starts getting later and she says that she better get to bed, I'll ask if I can stay and she'll say something like that she needs to get a good night's sleep because she has an early morning, or that she isn't feeling great and just wants to sleep solo. Early on there were a few times she wanted me to sleep over, but that's become the exception instead of the norm. 

She said it takes her some time to get used to sleeping in the same bed as someone, which I totally get. But it just feels really weird to me because I've never dated someone who *didn't* want me sleeping over after spending an evening together.

One of the most meaningful things to me in my experiences a few months into dating someone new has been waking up together in the morning and starting the day off talking to them - especially on weekends when you can spend a couple hours chatting in the morning. I've always felt like those times were when I really started connecting with people on a deeper level, including with her during the few times we have spent the night together.

I feel bad for even having this thought pop up, but it makes me miss how in my last relationship she *always* wanted me to sleep over, and would sleep wrapped around me and would jokingly refuse to let go of me in the morning. Even on days she wasn't feeling great or had an early morning ahead.

It's probably a ""me"" problem, and I am totally sympathetic to her wanting a good night's sleep so I don't want to be selfish and ask her to sacrifice that for me. But at the same time it does make me feel kinda crappy when we spend a great night together, and maybe even have sex, but then I get kicked out and have to go spend the night alone. But I'm not sure how to broach the issue, or whether I even should.

Any perspectives and thoughts would be super helpful.

She said that she never lost feelings or anything for me. And she used to text me a lot when we can’t see each other but now she won’t talk to me at all unless i say something first. I’ve been overthinking a lot and I really love her and i was in love with what we once had but i don’t know if we still have that spark we once had. i’ve talked to her about it before but she said she just wants to put some attention to her girl friends and i totally get that. But not even a message now and then? i don’t know anymore. any advice on how to keep this relationship alive? I see she is also hanging out with  this one specific member in our friend group noticeably more and everyone else thinks it’s a bit strange. none of us and her childhood best friend think she could be cheating because she isn’t the kind of person to do that and stuff.

We talked about this before and also after our fifth date. She said that she enjoyed spending time with me, felt comfortable with me, liked me as a person, but she just couldn’t get romantic feelings for me even though she wanted to.

Part of me believes that because this was the first time I ever dated, I had inexperience holding me back, and I never had the confidence to make moves with her in person to show her my intent of wanting to be more than just friends. I held her hand only once during our third date and that was only for a few minutes. And I was too reserved in person with my feelings for her, even though I was much more open with her whenever we would text and she enjoyed those text conversations too.

Have you been in a similar situation, were you able to find a romantic spark when there was none initially and what allowed it to happen?

If it helps, she said that she doesn’t care about physical appearance that much, she told me that I looked better than my pictures, that I was above average looking, and cute. She’s a bit more of a traditional girl and wants to feel inner strength from the man.

We’re no longer dating, but I still have feelings for her and I really feel like she’s the person I want to spend a lot more time with. Right now I’m focusing on myself to build up my confidence and improve my social life by making an effort to meet with friends more and to meet their friends too so that I can better connect with people in person (she said I wasn’t able to connect with her emotionally which is something she wants).

Try putting yourself in her shoes, how would you react if I were to express my feelings for her and ask to spend more time with her again if I were to come back as a more confident and sociable person sometime after New Year’s?

She knew I was looking for a relationship, but wanted to take things slow. I put my best foot forward and treated her the best I could. 

Everything was going well and we connected right off the bat. She got out of a long term relationship about a year before we started seeing each other. 

I asked her to be my girlfriend and she said, “she wasn’t ready for a relationship.” And “needed time.” I said ok that’s fine and walked away. That was about two months ago. 

Texted her this past weekend as I went to the restaurant we had our first date at with some cousins. (Wasn’t my choice of restaurant.) Told her it reminded me of her and it made me smile. And I hope she was doing well. She wished the same. Told her I was going out to a bar and if she wanted to meet up we could. She said she was already out with friends. And it ended there. 

I know I shouldn’t have reached out after she rejected me. I just was kind of hoping for answers and closure. A part of me was hoping she would at least miss me a bit and want to take things slow again. I know her not reciprocating should be closure, but it just feels off.

I had recently changed  my tinder profile to be looking for a FWB after a series of unsatisfying  dates, deciding to focus on finding someone to keep warm with rather  than looking for something serious. Her and I talked extensively of our  interests, and when we met, we had an outstanding physical connection.

I  think we were both surprised by the intensity of the emotional/mental  connection though. We have so much in common, and she is everything I  want in a partner. We hang out probably 3x a week (really as much as our  schedule affords), go out together during the day, have gotten each  other gifts, and sometimes get so distracted enjoying each others'  company that we forget to be physically intimate. I haven't liked  someone this much in years, and look forward to our time together more  than anything else.

While she has  stated that she really ""loves"" our time together, she's also recently  out of multiple year relationship, and is in no rush to be a part of a  couple again. While we've both told all of our people about each other,  she doesn't want to meet my friends yet or vice versa, and she doesn't  want to spend thanksgiving together (even though we're both spending it  alone). Those things make it feel too relationshipy for her, which I  totally respect.

Here's where the  issue is. I'm falling really hard. Like wanting to say ""I love you."" I  don't want to scare her off, so any time something feels too serious for  her, I respect her wishes and don't push it. I think that, given time,  she will want to be partners. But I could be wrong, and I fear I'm  setting myself up to get my heart broken. I need a way to calm down my  feelings for her, and make sure I don't express my feelings for her down  the line just to have her say ""this is purely physical for me, I think  we should stop."" Have you got any suggestions?

TL;DR  - New FWB is everything I want in a relationship.

There needs to be a pill that can eliminate the sexual focus that male hormones create. Masturbation in totally bad for posture and symmetrical muscle management, and is just tiring after 30+ years. Sex between two people is so much better designed as an activity, but so very dangerous.
