I look back and through all the emotions and heartbreak and money I have thrown at these women , I know only now I have learnt some lessons , that I should have seen ,for one I should have been stronger and put myself first , this would have surely overcome the kick in the teeth I got from not standing up for what was mine 

At 50 I look after myself and consider myself a decent looking guy with good values , my ex was beautiful and 11 years younger than me , but the emotions that have come with , the separation I now find it hard to give myself to any body else and dating or even a friend with benefits is not on the cards at all , I can‚Äôt even contemplate it 

Through the last 7 Months I tried to be friends withy ex but ended up blocking her and deleting her number on Saturday  as it was too hard to try to be friends , knowing I should have done this months ago as she is now dating another guy and what I didn‚Äôt know wouldn‚Äôt have hurt me and my life would have been allot further on than it is now 

A VALUABLE LESSON TO ANY ONE TALKING ABOUT THUS SHOULD I GO NO CONTACT ‚Äú‚Äù HELL YES DEFINITELY AND DO IT NOW THEY WONT BE IN YOUR LIFE MUCH LONGER EVEN IF YOU THINK THEY ARE GOING TO BE - BE STRONG‚Äù

So the top and bottom
Of it all is that I don‚Äôt think I can go through this again giving my all only to be broken up With ,when it all goes wrong , one of the things I need learn to do is stop overthinking , stop worrying , learn to let go and put myself first before anyone else , which has been a massive wake up call

The positives out of this is below 


1. I have 2 fantastic kids who love me dearly 
2. I have fantastic friends who love me dearly 
3. I have made some new friends who I can socialise with even more 
4. I have taken up a new sport golf along with keep fit 
5. I finally came off my ex‚Äôs mortgage after 14 years and got a mortgage within 3 months weird lol 
6. I Got a brand new house which I have done up amazingly and brand new car 
7. I have a fantastic job 
8. I am healthy fit and alive and I wake up in the morning knowing today is going to be alright

I've also reminded myself that a lot of these good feelings I associated with him were actually about ME. I kept my kitchen clean because I knew he might come over.

For most of my childhood, he got my sister and I ready for school while my mom slept in. At night, he was home from work by 5:20 and helping my mom in the kitchen by 5:30. Evenings were family time, and weekends were my parents basically doing everything together. Complicating this, mom and dad were control freaks ‚Äî they didn‚Äôt like other people telling them how to live their lives (except for dad‚Äôs work ‚Äî dad played the corporate schmoozing game well); this extended to my sister and I ‚Äî growing up, mom and dad didn‚Äôt have space in their lives for our opinions, and our job was basically to tag along with them silently nights and weekends (note: thank goodness I‚Äôm generation X ‚Äî weekdays were my free time since my parents turned us loose in the neighborhood while they worked; teams sports were also a sanctuary for me). 

Perhaps because of this, it may have been inevitable I ended up with a wife of 25 years was a control freak ‚Äî it was her way or the highway ‚Äî and for the most part my job (after work) was to support her wishes and plans.

When I‚Äôm not with families or SOs, I make friends very easily ‚Äî but my parents and then later my wife never liked my friends, or wanted to do anything I suggested. So over time, I learned not to include friends in my plans, or to make plans outside of what my wife or parents wanted.

The irony is that I‚Äôm actually a good planner. In the year or two between living with my parents and meeting my wife, and then in those months after my wife left me, I rarely had free time because I was always with friends and making plans, and when I dated I was pretty good at making fun and spontaneous dates. But that is a side of me I‚Äôve learned to shut down when I‚Äôm in a relationship.

Now I am in a new LTR with a wonderful lady. And most of the time we do things by ourselves, or with her daughter, or with her friends, and she is so supportive and loving of me, but only rarely we do things with my family or friends as I revert to that old passive side of myself. 

Today some of my friends reached out ‚Äî do my SO and I want to do something with them tonight?  And I suddenly realized how much stress I feel when a friend reaches out to me. What if my SO has other plans for us? Or she doesn‚Äôt want to spend an evening with my friends tonight? Suddenly I feel stress that when a friend invites us out, I am creating inconvenience for my SO or will decline and thus disappoint my friends. In short, I worry that I will disappoint someone just because my friend(s) invited us out. 

It‚Äôs just so much easier for me to not have my own friends (especially since I can make friends soooooooo easily when I want to). Which probably isn‚Äôt healthy. And makes me sad‚Ä¶

Now, my daughter (20F) has told me that she thinks it‚Äôs time I get back in the dating scene as she says she doesn‚Äôt want me to think I have to be alone. Im thankful that my daughter and I are able to openly discuss this type of situation and that she understands that at some point I need to move on with my life.

I guess what im getting at is if there are any fellow widowers in this group, how did you approach the dating scene after your loss? What did you find worked for you? The last time I even knew what OLD was the internet functioned off of a compact disk with 400 free hours. This new scene with the likes of Tinder, POF, Match and so on makes me feel weird.

But it‚Äôs so true. I understand all too well why it‚Äôs like this, yet I don‚Äôt. Why is it this hard? Why do we constantly match up, and then a few days or weeks later get discarded? Or discard ourselves? 

Ugh I was so hopeful. Yet again. Met a wonderful, cute woman and moved things right along..we met within five days. And now the texting is disappearing already, after she (and I!) was super excited for a second date, telling me she wanted to take me out this time, and saying how cute I was for asking to see her again soon the next day. 

Ugh. I hate dating. Too many flakes, too many bad dates, and in the real world every woman I meet has a goddam ring on it. If I by chance meet a naked ring finger, she‚Äôs a train wreck in some way. 

I get into a week or two high..multiple matches and some conversations and a date sometimes out of it. Then it dies out for a few weeks and the cycle starts again. It‚Äôs always the few weeks after a good prospect exits that the apps kill my algorithm or whatever it is they do, so my anxiety and depression both take over and I‚Äôm just bummed for a week. 

I just want to be happy with someone. Not be lonely anymore. I was looking forward to spring adventures with someone. Nope. Then summer beach fun. Nope. Now fall excursions seem like they‚Äôre flirting away by the wayside too and with them the holidays‚Ä¶alone again and putting on a brave face for my kids and family/friends who all think I should‚Äôve been locked down by someone easily. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a catch!‚Äù ‚ÄúAny woman is looking for exactly what you offer!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just not being forward/funny/adventurous/(insert any descriptor here) enough‚Äù

Yes, I also live with my parents, which is hindering me from finding my soulmate, as well.

Yes, I know I'm posting this in the ""Dating over 40"" group, but to be honest, I find older women wiser more mature.

My hobbies are reading books like ""Harry Potter"", and books by John Grisham; playing card games; playing dominoes; watching birds; and being online finding recipes.

Other activities I enjoy doing are watching tv, going to the movies, going out to eat, going to the beach, shop, and going on vacations.  I am pretty limited on things I can do because of my cerebral palsy.  I do try to workout a little bit, though.

I do not smoke.  I do not do drugs, but I do have a glass of wine a couple of times a year on Thanksgiving and Christmas!

I hope I can find a woman who is kind, gentle, loving, caring, sincere, understanding, funny, and loves to cuddle.  If you want to talk, I'm here! üôÇ

At some point this summer, the ex decided to take herself off her meds for Bipolar 1, and over the last 3+ weeks she‚Äôs gone off the rails. She even got arrested on Labor Day. I now have had my kids for 4 straight weeks, which in turn has not allowed me to spend time freely with the woman I‚Äôve been dating off and on for the last 11 months. We‚Äôre both single parents with our kids most of the time, so best we can expect is a date every 2 weeks, sometimes an extra date sprinkled in. Hence, the slow moving relationship.

My parents offered to take my kids this Saturday afternoon and overnight to give me a break. Naturally I reached out to her yesterday about getting together. She texted me back to say she had tentative plans with her sister, but was also apprehensive about spending time with me due to the behavior of my ex. 

I understand her position, as one never knows what a truly crazy ex will do while in this state. The last thing I want is for crazy to finally learn of this woman‚Äôs existence and harass her like she‚Äôs harassed me and members of my family over the last month. It made me think about whether I just do her the favor and walk away since it could be weeks or more before this mess cleans up in court, etc. I also wonder if she‚Äôs holding back saying she wants to distance herself from the situation just to avoid kicking me while I‚Äôm down. I mean‚Äîthis is going to be my life until my kids are adults. 

The timing of all this really sucks because our relationship seemed to have started to progress finally. I admit, I‚Äôm missing her, but I don‚Äôt want to be bread-crumbed either. Wondering if the right thing to do for us both is ""set her free"" or just let her decide for herself by outright telling her it's ok if she does wish to step away.

Let‚Äôs try again.

I recently went through a divorce. I have spent the past few months working on myself. Reading, exercising, eating healthy and seeing a therapist. On September 8th 2021 I received a DM on Facebook from an ex girlfriend. We dated in our early 20‚Äôs and are now in our mid 40‚Äôs. She simply asked how I was doing. I freaked out! Over the years we have tried to contact each other and it just never seemed to be the right time for one reason or another. She tells me she is divorced and is now in a difficult relationship with a verbally abusive alcoholic. I confess my love for her. We talk daily and it seems as though she is leaving her guy. I decide one day to send flowers to her work. I still remembered she likes lilies. We then set a date to meet. We meet at a park and sit next to a nice pond. We talk for an hour and catch up with work and kids stuff. Then out of nowhere I lean in and kiss her. It was so soft and slow. We held this kiss for what felt like an eternity. We pull back and look in each other‚Äôs eyes. I brush her hair back, caress her cheek and kiss her again. This time I feel her mouth open slightly and then our tongues meet and begin to play back and forth. At this point I am numb! This is what I was missing all these years. I knew instantly that something special was happening and so did she. We part ways and continue to text. Here comes the big red flag! I dug into her Facebook page and find out that she is engaged to her guy. Now this goes against every fiber of my being! I confront her and she tries to play it off as he will be gone soon. It has been ten days since she first messaged me and I feel like I‚Äôm in love and sick all the time. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing. Does anyone have a similar experience? What did you do? How do I go on knowing she is in a home and bed for all I know with this man? I‚Äôm so love sick and feel like I cannot make good decisions right now. Please send help and Nachos!!!

Anyway, at nights end I‚Äôm about to walk home and she offers to drive so I‚Äôm like ok, and when she drops me off we‚Äôre like let‚Äôs get together more but I also was wondering ‚Äúdo you want to come on up and continue the vibe? See what happens? Didn‚Äôt offer and I‚Äôm wondering if I fucked up? She seemed into me but I‚Äôm oblivious usually.

I do not have kids. He has his teenage kids full time and they are‚Ä¶ a lot. Their mom moved away and they need a lot of attention and course correction. One has severe depression. 

He comes to see me every 4 months or so. I don‚Äôt go there because the logistics would be weird. (But I recognize that I should go). 

I‚Äôve called it off a handful of times because I don‚Äôt see a future in 2,3 or 4 years. He wants to move here, get married etc but that hinges on the fact that the oldest kid (19) will launch. The younger kid (16) wants to move here and is eager for a fresh start. He keeps telling me to just be patient, it will all work out. I‚Äôm having a very hard time with it mostly due to the lack of communication surrounding all of this. 

I have spent zero time with either of the kids. We‚Äôve only ever talked on the phone. I can tell the younger kid is annoyed by me. 

So, today my bf announces that he HAS to bring his daughter the next time he comes out. That he has promised her and he just wants to ‚Äúget her off his back‚Äù.

News to me. 

This is a huge red flag to me. I feel like an absolute jerk saying no, but I am not comfortable at all with this and how he didn‚Äôt even ask me.
