In high school, it was easy to meet and talk to people. Problem was, I rarely had feelings for anyone, and when I did, they were rarely reciprocated. I dated, sure, but I never felt a real and genuine connection to anyone. Looking back, it was my loneliness that drove me to be with those people, despite the fact that I didn't want to admit that at the time. 

Fast forward to now. I'm a college student and have a much better understanding of what romance means to me and what I want out of a partner. A few months back, I became involved with a local group in my city that plays Pokemon Go. We meet up downtown every Wednesday and occasionally on the weekends to play the game together. Most of them are likeable enough, but I've really clicked with one woman in particular. She's beautiful and more or less the ""leader"" of the group, the one that everyone kind of gravitates around. I feel so comfortable around her and I can really and truly be myself around her, and I can't say that about a lot of people. I'm traditionally very shy, partly due to my autism, but all of that goes away when I'm with her. We've been spending a considerable amount of time with each other lately, sometimes with the group, other times just the two of us. We've had a lot of deep conversations and I really think something is developing between us, at least on my end. We're both single. Butttt....she's twice my age.

I'm not really someone who's against age gaps for the most part; I see nothing morally wrong here. I wouldn't normally go for someone her age, but I truly believe that she and I are kindred spirits and I seriously want to ask her out. More than anything, though, I don't want to ruin our friendship, because I consider her a valuable friend and I know that she reciprocates that much. I just cannot see a doctor in her 40s wanting to be with an angsty college kid who's barely out of his teens and is still trying to figure himself out. I would totally be content with staying as we are, and that's probably the best thing that we could do. We are at different points in life and we probably both want different things. But it's getting to the point where I can't get her out of my head, and I know that something is going to have to give soon. Either I get over this attraction, or I'll have to fess up. I really don't know what to do, and I certainly don't want to ask my parents for advice. They think it's weird that a woman her age hangs around people like me and they're already skeptical of her, and honestly, I don't blame them. I know I'll have to deal with that if things actually do progress, but for now, I can't see anything good coming out of them knowing.

For this current date that I am seeing, he’s asking me for a relationship but I am not certain if I like him romantically enough to be together? Again, it’s the same lukewarm feeling with my previous 2 relationships as well. 

I don’t think I know his values well enough to make a judgement, but based on our interactions, he’s very filial, loving and well-read. But he’s not exactly how I would imagine my ideal type to be - he’s more casual when it comes to dressing, and still a student while I’m already working.

I did think that when we met there was chemistry, we chatted about some hobbies, but things never went further than some flirting even though he has my number - I figured he wasn't interested or maybe didn't want to get involved with someone related to work. 
I do see now he swiped right on me and I'm debating what to do. I'm worried it will be awkward if we match, but then... he swiped right on me as well?? So he shouldn't feel weird about it, right? Unless it was an accident, I guarantee he can tell it is me from my photos.
Guys, what do you think if I 1) swipe right but don't message him (this is Bumble), do you think that's enough to show interest and maybe if he wants to take this further, he can text my number? 2) match with him and message something really mild acknowledging we met before and see how he reacts?
I am interested, but the reason why I'm worried is because I feel like I dropped hints that I'm into him when we talked irl, and he never ended up doing anything about that, and now I think if we match and I reach out it might be awkward since there is a chance he swiped right on accident. I heard men swipe right on everyone and I don't want to create an awkward situation.

We texted for a week and he asked if I wanted to hang out the next Monday, which was a few days later. I said yes and I get busy with work and I know he has a career so I said I’d see him on Monday and left it at that. Monday comes around and hadn’t any contact with the guy. It’s mid-afternoon so I write him off and I get myself comfortable with the idea he flaked. A few hours later he texted asking if I wanted to hang out. I think this is where I made the mistake because normally I tell myself if a guy was interested he would have planned something or at least texted me earlier on and I would have said I’m not interested. 

I instead decided I needed to get out of the house and hang out since I’d been stuck at home all weekend and really just wanted to do something. 

I go over to his house, we are chilling and relaxing. End up hooking up, then I went home. Before I left he said he was really happy I stopped by and he would bring me lunch on Thursday. 

Texted him that night I was home. All seemed good. Next day we had a text exchange about the sex and I asked him if it was just a hook up to let me know, and that it was ok, but I’d prefer not to be lead on or ghosted. He said that wasn’t the case, the sex was amazing and he still wanted to hang out. 

Thursday comes and he says he’s busy. Friday he says he was propositioned by his friend (girl) to date and have sex or something and that he didn’t want to sleep with two people at a time so he doesn’t think we should see each other. I was a bit upset because I had the sex conversation with him earlier and he made it seem like he wanted to date but I cooled down. He asked to call and explain the situation and I wasn’t interested so I declined and said good luck. 

Next day he asks to call again to explain. We had a good talk, he said he was confused and I told him he should go be with his friend if he’s confused because I would prefer to not be second place. He then said he wanted to go out with me again, how great the intimacy was. I decided to give him another chance, mostly because the sex was good. The next two days he makes plans with me and then last minute cancels them! 

So of course I get mad and I’m telling him he’s acting dismissive/avoidant and that it’s not nice to make plans and cancel and that I am not interested in dealing with this. I then write a final text stating that it hurts my feelings and that I can  explain to him why it does if he is interested in knowing. 

He then goes on to say it’s not classy of me to call him names and that he doesnt think he would want to deal with me after my response.

We met at work - instantaneous attraction but then we kept bumping into each other and enjoyed talking so much he wound up taking me out. One thing led to another, we've been seeing each other and he's been very clear that he's interested in moving the relationship towards something serious. We've not gotten to know each other quite to the point that I'd feel comfortable establishing a committed partnership yet, but he's already told his friends/family about me and on our first date he ended up driving me around his home town and walking me through his life story...introduces me to everyone he knows who we run into (small town)...texts me every single day just to remind me he's thinking of me...etc. 

My problem begins last weekend. I work 5:30 AM - 12:30 PM Saturday and Sunday at a weekend job (I just handed in my two weeks as I have another full time position and it's just gotten exhausting/I want my weekends back). He is off. We'd not seen each other in a few days and he asked if I worked on the weekend. I specified I would be off on Saturday evening. He told me he would see me then as long as I was free and wanted to cook dinner together. He tells me he'll be back from being in his home city (about 2 hrs away from where we live) in the evening on Saturday. I say okay, ask for a time, and he just keeps it at ""evening"". Saturday rolls around, we're messaging and he says he'll be back by 8 PM at the latest but he's going to try to get back before then. I offer to pick up the ingredients at the store since I needed to go anyways. Eventually he texts me he's leaving at 7:30 PM which puts his ETA an hour and a half later than he originally said he'd be. He called me when he was 20 minutes away to apologize, cited a bunch of errands he ran and he overslept for his nap as the reasons he was late - basically a bunch of minor stuff - etc. 

He arrived at my apartment at about 9:45 PM - nearly two hours later than he said would. We didn't finish cooking until 10:15 PM. He kept making side comments periodically about being a douche for how late he was, and when I disclosed at some point that I had to be up at 5 AM to work he apologized, realized as he was getting his stuff together that he'd left dishes for me to do from eating and made a comment about ""I should have done your dishes"", etc. He didn't let it go unacknowledged. But I did. I didn't respond to any of his comments, and when we'd spoken on the phone and he apologized I brushed it off in the moment. And I realized after the fact that I had let my desire to see him/how much I like him impact my addressing the issue. This is a problem because I do not want this to become an established pattern, but I also recognize that I did not communicate with him whatsoever. This is the first time this sort of thing has ever happened before. He's been on time to all of our other dates, but I suppose I am also floored because he came up with the plan himself, had me go to the store etc., and then was late to the plans *he* established with *me*. Which is concerning.

I guess now that it's after the fact, how do I reasonably and maturely establish the boundary that my time needs to be respected? At one of the points he said he felt bad I did tell him, ""I could have just told you not to come over because of how late you would be, told you we'd cook together another day"" and he said, ""You're right - you could have. And I wouldn't have been upset."". But that's about as close as we got to acknowledging it.

*We all have one person that we always want to fall in love with, but unfortunately, that guy is a kind of person who always consider love as a second choice after his study target. (From my experience they're always really good at school)*

Feel related?

It may seem like you’re the only one who’s spending days, months, even years thinking about how to forget someone like that – but you’re definitely not alone. I could write a book on it. It took me a year to find the answer for the question ""how can I attract him"". Needless to say, the asshole didn’t love me back. He’s not an asshole, I mean, I couldn’t force him to love me, but after all waiting, now he's my boyfriend yaeh. So I'm talking about how to achieve a guy like that.

1. WAITING. with such a good-at-school person, the competition with other girl to get him is zero, so the only thing that I can tell you should do is waiting, wait for him till he achieve his goal, then one day, you will get the love deserve your patience.
2. Don't try to forget about him or pretend like you don't care about him, if you want him, buy him flowers (i mean, say him your feelings), make him know that you'll wait, that works will let him know that there's a person that always wait for him. And remember, if you ever think that you guys couldn't be a couple, then STOP!

I decided to share this story because I meet a really nice girl that studies in the same college as I do. We had a couple of trips together with other friends. After these experiences I realized that I truly enjoy spending time with her, and it seems that she feels the same.

This situation started about 2 weeks ago and has escalated drastically since then. So I am a guy who only looks for sex from women and no type of relationship, and before I do anything with girls I let them know I’m just trying sleep with you and I I’m not interested in a relationship. And for the most part things go okay except for  one particular girl didn’t seem to get it. After about about a week and a half of talking to this F[19] from my school we hit it off pretty quick and we winded up sleeping with each other even though she knows what kind of guy I am and what I want. The next day she starts texting me and i don’t respond which I do to almost all the girls after I sleep with them. But after 23 texts o had to respond and tell her to stop and that she needs to leave me alone, and that’s when it started. In a 2 week time span she went back to all the girls I had slept with and told them crazy things like I forced her to do things she didn’t want and that I’m some kind of lunatic who cares nothing about women and so on. So all the girls I had slept with in the past agreed with her and started saying I did similar things to them like force them to sleep with me off rip and other things.

kids by now. I’ll see relatives who will ask me if i’m married yet,and I’m only 22,lol.

Girls would come to class and show off their new rings,and frats/sororities would brag about which one had the most engagements. 

Then I changed environments,and I realize how unusual my background was. It seems like for most people,your college years are more for playing around and not settling down.

She lives  far away and we’ve had contact over the phone a lot - talking and face  timing at least 2-4 times a week, sometimes up to 4 hours. We really  want to meet each other and she has been talking about traveling to my  place.

The other day i started to  look at trips to her city as well. While doing this i noticed how lots  of questions arose within me and i built up a wall of anxiety. Going  there just over one day is basically doable if i take a plane, but it’s  not very practical because of the long distance. So i started to look  for an airbnb room to have somewhere to sleep and put my bag. Dating is  something that i always have been very anxious about and i don’t have  much experience in it.

Yesterday  when we were face timing again i told her that i had looked up some  options and that i’m not sure how to sort it out. I also told her that  it got me very nervous. She refused the idea of me taking an airbnb room  and invited me to stay in a room in her apartment instead. She also  offered me to borrow her computer because i might have a little work to  do. Pretty kind of her, right?

Regarding  the extreme nerves, she said that she’d be nervous as well but tried to  view it as just a casual meeting with a friend. We both agreed to avoid  any ”traditional dating” activities, such as dinner and whatnot.  Instead she could show me around her city and we could go to a museum.

She  is so nice and this was a great conversation. But my anxiety is still  crippling. What if we don’t click at all? If we run out of topics? If it  gets awkward? If we fulfill this particular plan we would spend very  much time together. I fear the thought of sitting in her apartment in  the evening after a full day, not having anything left to say and being  awkward. One thing that is common for me when i get anxious or very  nervous is that i start to feel very nauseous which prevents me from  eating and in worst case scenario i might even have to throw up. When i  start to over think this my brain becomes a tombola moving at the speed  of light and i almost get numb from anxiety.

**TL;DR:**  I’m planning to go on a long distance date. This would mean that we’d  have to spend a lot of time together on the first date, even with a  sleep over. I’m basically scared of feeling trapped with no place or  excuse to leave if we wouldn’t click. How should i think regarding all  this?

We have an age gap, I’m 28 and him 34. He was engaged about 5 years ago to his long time gf of 10 years. And she cheated on him with his best friend. It put him into a huge depression and he gained a lot of weight over those 4 years. He bought the condo they lived in. And that also became the place where he got cheated on. He moved out, rented another place and still has the condo because it’s equity in the future. He also suffers from PTSD when he was in college and got paralyzed for a temporary time while playing football. While knowing all this I still chose to give him a chance because I didn’t want to judge or assume the worse. He also worked a lot being a manager and did a lot of side hustles on the side that kept him busy. And I had no issue with that since I’m about my hustle too. The issue was despite him always talking to me and treating me well, there were things that made me question if it was going to work. 

Normally when I date people, I can see them at least once a week or even multiple times a week. But in my case it started off like once a month ( we were in lockdown for the first month and a half) and then became maybe 2 times a month if I got lucky. His work schedule changing to later was definitely a factor to this and I was hoping it would get back to normal. When I was with him, he made me feel loved and very happy. We had a lot of great times. But as the days went by and my high of him faded, I got depressed because I wasn’t getting the time I needed from him. I even found myself trying to distract myself and keep busy, which is ridiculous now that I think about it. He should’ve been the one to do that for me. 

I even found myself being hesitant to ask him to go places with me since I knew his schedule was messed up. There were many times he was free. Weekends, holidays and had plans in advance or chose to relax which I understand. Typing this all out makes me upset that I put up with all this. And the most recent thing I’m dealing with is how he is handling coping with stress. He indulges in alcohol and it’s because of his ex. He says it’s not but he’s clearly still upset about it without realizing it. He needs therapy and I need to get out. I was thinking of being friends with him, because I don’t want to abandon him when I said I would be there. I understand mental health well and he needs someone in his corner.

I grew up poor (like living below the poverty line) and was pretty severely bullied at school.

I dropped out of high school and taught myself for 4 years, I did pretty well at it and got a scholarship to college and law school. I lived at home during college and commuted there so didn't have much of a social life. I did well at college and law school and graduated summa cum laude in both degrees. After a lot of trouble in job interviews I finally landed a good job and have gone from poverty to being materially comfortable.

I had always kind of assumed that, having grown up poor that money would solve all of my life problems. It's solved a lot of them tbh, renting my own apartment instead of living at home is quite nice, as is not having to count pennies all the time, but one problem remains: I've never had sex. I've never really tried either thinking I was too ugly and weird to have a chance.

I started on the apps a few months back at the behest of a drunk girl friend from work. Got a few matches but nothing really happened on tinder or bumble - I got some good matches but no real convos happening. On hinge I did better for some reason and have had quite a few matches and have gone out on dates with 5 different women. The first woman was quite cute and I went out on four dates with her and had my first kiss with (she initiated a french kiss with me after the fourth and final date). She ended up breaking up with me saying she wasn't ready for a relationship and things were moving too quickly. I didn't gel with the next two girls. The fourth one I quite liked (she was very attractive which helped) but she sent me back a message a few days later wishing me the best on hinge but saying we just ""didn't vibe"". The 5th girl I didn't really vibe with. To be honest I have the impression that after the initial novelty of actually having women attracted to me that I don't particularly like the apps and find it an artificial social interaction and would prefer naturally finding a woman in real life, but am too afraid to really try that.

Posting here to try and get as much help as possible (hope that doesnt go against the rules?)

**TLDR: I (22M) have been speaking with a girl (20F) from the East of Europe, both in person and via texts. Things were going extremely well at the beginning, I screwed up, she clams up and hardly talks to me, but has not yet blocked me. If this were a girl from anywhere else, I would have got the message by now, but from what I have read, culture differences mean I am supposed to ty and win her back.**

I (22M) met a girl (20F) from Eastern Europe a few months ago. We spoke amicably in person on a number of occasions, and via text. She asked for my details so that we can stay in touch when she is back home.

We texted back and forth for a few weeks, definitely not in a flirtatious way, about our countries, studies, jobs etc. However around a month ago the conversations became far more flirtatious.

She was telling me I had the perfect body type, an extremely sexy accent, asked how long is left before my studies are over, asked if my mother would like her, and other cues that I was clearly supposed to be picking up on and generally sizing me up to see if I am a potential partner. We began calling over the phone and the conversations were always fantastic and brightened up my day.

She was very clearly interested in me, and many of my Eastern European (from the same country as her) friends said the same thing, as did my friends from the West. I even began putting in place the plans to visit her and her country, strongly encouraged to do so by her (plans that remain in place, and ones that will go ahead regardless because of the fact I have always wanted to visit the region).

However, for reasons I won't go into here, I screwed up. Nothing more than a miscommunication and cultural differences really, I was not rude, impolite, vulgar or made a bad taste joke, or anything abnormal for that matter, it more so a matter of me incorrectly interpreting what she said and being something she was not used to.

She got very pissed off. She stopped calling me and said that she was done and was blocking me. I know things moved quickly, but this was completely heartbreaking to hear.

However a few days went by and she had not done so. I asked her why and she said that she was ""rethinking"" the situation. She had also told me when we were speaking as friends that if she ever got a boyfriend or was dating someone, she would stop talking to me out of principal, which I completely understand and appreciated.

We have since been texting back and forth but the conversations are very clearly not what they used to be. She used to respond very quickly, now it can be hours and she has no problem leaving me on read.

She told me the situation would be ""very hard to fix"" but I told her that I am 100% committed to doing so, regardless of how hard that may be.

We had a very good conversation the other day, texting back and forth all day and she seemed to be enjoying talking and was very present and engaged, sending pictures of her nails and talking essentially like we had been before everything went to hell.

However since then, the conversations have been even worse than before. Leaving nearly every message on read, giving half hearted responses and not even replying to topics that I know she finds very interesting.

My friends have told me that if she really was done, she would have gone by now and she is essentially ""testing"" to see if I am serious about wanting a relationship and am committed to fixing the situation.

This makes sense, and it is what I am used to experiencing with women from Western Europe/North America. If you piss them off, they stop talking to you, you try talking to them and they tell you that they are not interested.

From the research I have done both online and speaking to people, I seem to need to ""win her back"". Just like the west, I have been told that if this girl really was done with me, or if she was seeing someone else, she would have blocked me a very long time ago.

I have also heard that she is not wanting to appear as ""easy"" and my suspicion for her latest lack of communication is she was worried that the one good conversation we had may have sent the wrong message to me that I can get her back that easily.

As I say, I still plan on visiting the country because I have wanted to do so for a long time, but I would obviously be lying if I said that seeing her and trying to fix this mess was not an equally big pull factor.

I suppose my question is three fold:

1. Is all of this information I have got from people and the internet complete crap
2. Is this situation completely screwed
3. If not, what can I do to fix this situation

There was also some black hair in the skink (I have black hair though so I wasn’t too worried about that) but I asked about the blood stain and he said “babe, idk where that came from.

Everything is very easygoing and just feels so natural. The natural comforting vibe between us both really drew me in. I spent the night with him last night for the second time and we really opened up to each other. It was really important to me that we start having that vulnerability, open communication, and emotional connection before we got intimate. 

We both wanted to be intimate and I had felt comfortable with where we were with things after both of us opening up more. But for the first time I was actually really nervous. I’m no stranger to getting to the deed but for some reason I was nervous. Early this morning we were both up and I had finally decided that I did want to so we did. It was kinda awkward and left me feeling concerned. We didn’t feel connected, felt more distant, empty, and kinda like a chore. I couldn’t even tell if he was enjoying it or not. 
Sexual chemistry is really important to me. In usual cases I would just cut my losses and move on but I really want to see where this goes.

**What am I looking for?**

\* Someone to invest some of their time in a scientific relationship experiment and work with me to solve the mysteries.

**What is in it for you ?**

\*A chance to learn about yourself from your partner’s point of view. I can’t change the relationship’s that you have already lost but it might make future ones a lot easier.

\*A chance to find out whether you really need a relationship to be happy or just to live or not.

**Some of the things they I would like to test during our course will be -**

\*Can relationships make you overcome mental stress and problems like depression and anxiety. And if yes to which extent they actually help.

\*Can having someone’s carnal needs satisfied make them a more sane person.

\*Can relationships help you overcome your past trauma?
