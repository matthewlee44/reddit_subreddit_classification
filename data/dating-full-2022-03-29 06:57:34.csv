I am an 18 year old guy, I consider myself mature for my age. I have dated this girl for about a year and a half (she is a little less than two years older than me) and I got dumped about a month ago. This relationship I felt was really strong until the end. Of course we had our problems but that's with every relationship. Towards the end of the relationship I moved across the country for a few months to pursue my dreams. She was really supportive of that move but maybe didn't realize that it had that much of an effect on her. Two weeks after I moved she visited me for 5 days, these days were great although I may have been consumed by my work and missed out on a few things. When she left we were on a good note although maybe a little rocky because of the distance. Two weeks after that I have come to visit for a week and a half, although she wasn't in the area as she had to take up a trip for business reasons. Once she had come back it felt a little like we were strangers. Then we got to talking and she came to a conclusion that she wanted to end it, it wasn't a planned breakup. Although I felt as if this was out of the blue and I started fighting it asking her if she was sure. I believe this may have pushed her away more as I was still pursuing the relationship. I then moved back away once again. Although it festered in me, and I was too bothered by the idea that we gave up on a good thing. So I made a dumb decision, I texted her that we should talk about our relationship. Although she agreed, we had a great conversation and we asked how each other were going. She cried and we talked about how things were, she talked about how she felt the relationship was in a rut, we never talked about getting back together. Since that went alright and wanting my girl back I then called her again, we had another great conversation, this time I asked her if she wanted to go get ice cream to talk about ""something"" once I get back (These conversations lasted hours). She agreed and said that she would be down, although two weeks later I return and she seemed more distant this time. I called her asking if she wanted to go get ice cream she then agreed, although later texted me that she suddenly got busy exclaiming that she would text me later. later that night I ran into her and she never decided to text me back. She then left and I called her asking if she wanted to discuss things. She agreed, we met up and I didn't really know what to say anymore she was making it more clear that she wasn't interested. Although we gave two long hugs and went our separate ways. As soon as I left, I gave her a call and told her that she had made it clear enough to me, I didn't want to go out for ice cream anymore as she was just doing it out of what I would say is pity.

I sit here really confused, and I feel the way our relationship ended with a series of unfortunate events. I know I love her, but she had made a decision and she stayed true to that decision. This hurts me a lot thinking maybe if I did something a little differently things would have been very different. To the very conversation that lead to a breakup, or to the times I called her. I believe I pushed her away by trying to pull her back in. I believe there are signs that she would want to get back together, but these signs dwindled the more I pursued them. Now I am curious if it is a bad thing to ever go for her again. We now live back in the same small town, although I know that we both are moving to the same area this summer. I will continuously run into her as she is related to my best friends and is the sister of my closest friend.

Long story short, we went out on one date (she knew it was a date because her friend told me she had brought it up), and then I asked her out on a second date and she told me that she didn’t want to date anyone at work and she was sorry if I was misled. A little confused since she agreed to the first date. 

I said I understood and thanks for the company at dinner (first date), and was going to leave it at that, but she continued to text me talking about her living situation and also about meeting up later in the week. Was a little taken aback given what she had just told me, thought she would have the decency to give me some space.

And then he kinda pulled away emotionally 4 months into the relationship when I told him my life goals… I want kids in the future but not anytime soon.

So I just brushed it off my back. But we broke up few months back. To make it clear, I've never told him I wanted a break or my family doesn't like him. He wanted a break up so I gave in. But even if we did break up we still talk to each other, sleep and meet up often. If I bring up the topic of getting back together he just doesn't want to. 
So, we stopped talking about a month ago and I thought it would be the same as before. Maybe he'd talk after a few days or so. But he hasn't. And this time he sent a friend request to some girl on Facebook and I think they're talking. I've texted him but he didn't read my texts. I'm really heartbroken.

I’ve never been in a relationship so may be overthinking this.. sorry for the length and thank you so much if you do finish reading this. 

Last year, I (18F) matched with a guy (19) on both Bumble and Hinge. We exchanged socials. From August 2021 to last week, he became increasingly consistent with messaging me (from once or twice a month, to every week or so, and then virtually daily the last few months). However through a lot of it, conversations rarely exceeded basic small talk, so I thought he was just sociable and didn’t think much. 

He was constantly messaging me no matter how many times I didn’t reply - I was not very emotionally invested, but when I did show more interest he seemed to become reclusive... causing me to pull away and him to initiate again. For context, we never called, but did send voice memos/videos often. A couple weeks ago he repeatedly mentioned that we should do a certain activity together, but didn’t make a plan. I spoke with our mutual friends that go to his college, who told me that he actually quite shy in person, which I had not expected given his frequent initiation. Considering the shyness, I asked to meet up. Please keep in mind I did most of the planning.

On the day he was in fact very shy. He warmed up over time but I still carried asking questions, finding convo topics, and suggesting places for us to go. He rarely reciprocated the questions, and in general I had to guide and lead everything.  We thankfully had more substantial chat, but it was still less than what I wanted. At the end he offered to go out his way to drive me home. 

Despite my constant having to lead (again I must stress.. so unlike our dynamic over text), he was genuinely lovely and that combined with the interest he had been showing me the past (SO MANY) months, I feel myself developing feelings for him. That night we messaged briefly, and discussed seeing each other again, but only vaguely, before it went back to small talk. I ended up not replying because his last message was very general and seemed conclusive. 

Since our meeting on Friday, he has not messaged me like he usually does. I’m guessing maybe the real life interaction/dynamic has now transferred online? I would like to reach out, but again most of our conversations are very surface level and I am finding it hard to find something to talk about, as I don’t just want to say ‘how are you’ or something baseless. We are also not at a point where I feel like I can ask him to define his feelings, as even though there has been so much conversation, the lack of anything deep means I am still not that comfortable around him/we are still a bit formal. I’m definitely extroverted/playful in person and I can tell he would be too (if he wasn’t so shy lmao), but we are both also clearly very polite.

Just wondering what steps I should take next, and if the discrepancy in his character online and in person says anything?

TLDR: guy very interested in me online over a period of ~7/8 months. I finally ask to meet and he is shy and almost shut off (but still trying?).

Long story short, I met an incredible girl and we hit it off on a dating app. Then ended up meeting a few weeks later bc of busy/clashing schedules. 

After meeting, her vibe slowly faded away and she kinda became distant  ( late replies ) etc....it seemed like she wasnt that interested after meeting in person &amp; that's fair. She's gone on holiday with some family so i haven't even talked to her a in like a week+ bc i dont want to disturb. 

I know I should get over it and move on - but im struggling too. After meeting so many people, I really did think she was the one :( . Now i'm bummed that i've prob fumbled it. Really bumbed actually.

My problem is i went on a handful of dates bc im picky and i REALLY thought this was the One man. I really did. I put in sooo much effort and honestly just fked it up so bad....

it's kinda had a pre horrible mental toll on me and i pre much deleted all my apps and honestly can't seem to take her outta my mind.

I texted her the next day trying to plan date 2. 

Then she stops responding, and a couple days later sends me this:

""I’m sorry for my late response, but i needed some time to think. Friday was super fun, but if i’m being honest with myself dating is just not something i’m ready for. I got out of a 4.5 year relationship a month ago and i thought i was ready for serious bc i’m a relationship person but i’m just so not! more so, i don’t know why but i would really just like to save the gym for work and friends. i love it there and i don’t to risk ruining that by getting into a relationship with a member. I really hope you understand and i probably should have seen this coming sooner. i really am sorry for any hurt i might have caused!""

I'm going to see her at the gym like I have been. Is it over and should I just move on? Should I straight up ignore her and give her no attention other than a hello?

You guys gave me wonderful insight and I appreciate it a lot. Why I’m back with some updates! So the guy I’ve been seeing for almost a year is pretty close with his ex girlfriend. it’s been an up and down battle for me. I thought it was over it and feeling secure. But lately feelings of insecurity are back...
My partner was friends with this person for years before they dated. They also dated and lived together for years. I’ve talked to him a lot about how it makes me feel. That it’s been tricky for me and feelings of jealousy have been there. Again thought I was over it. But guess not.

I’m here now venting because I don’t want to exhaust anyone in my inner circle with this situation. I want to be understanding and open. Lately I’ve just been struggling with the frequency in which she reaches out. Calling days in a row when he doesn’t answer. Calling when she’s close by to come over. Calling on a Saturday night to hang out. there’s a closeness there. there’s still pictures of them together on his Instagram. She still has a heart by her name in his phone. Like why? Is he not over it? Why won’t he take down the photos?
Lately he’s been way more open and tells me when she’s calling and why. Which I recognize and appreciate.

But she’s always the one reaching out. Sometimes calling multiple times a week. Is she not over it? I don’t know if I need to be worried about it or if I’m being fucking delusional.

She does ask about me and us. She follows me on social media.. Idk. Am I tripping? Lol this whole thing brings up past trauma me for me. We aren’t officially dating and I think that’s why I have still have feelings on uncertainty. I probably should get back into therapy. I’m just trying to get this situation off my mind.

I want clarity but also to respect her time and boundaries. I really don't think it's disinterest...

I (22m) went on a first date this past Friday with a girl. She told me she's quite busy with studies at the moment as she's writing an essay. We're both university students, had a great first date that lasted for four hours, lots in common, laughed a lot, and made out at the end of the night. Now conversation in real life was a breeze, but we're both terrible texters, and this was apparent even before our first date and we said as much during our date. Texting is quite stilted and moves very slowly between us, which isn't helpful when it comes to planning dates. 

On Sunday I asked her if she would like to meet again sometime during the week. She replies that she's quite busy (school, plans, family visiting), but that we should get in touch sometime later I tell her to let me know when she's free, suggesting that we do something fun, relaxing for next time. ""Sounds good!"", she replies. Hmm... was hoping she would suggest a day.

 I should probably have been more specific (day, time, activity) and assertive in asking her out, but since she's busy and somewhat  stressed I figured I'd leave it open for her.
 
 I feel like I'm in kind of an awkward spot now, wondering what my next step is.

I've been dating a guy for 6/7 months. There have been two major events that happened that have caused us to break up each time (currently broken up).

He was showing me something on his phone and his ex girlfriends name popped up. By asking questions, I learned that they had a friendship, spoke weekly or bi-weekly and had recently saw each other while we were dating and failed to mention that to me. He swore up and down they are just friends and he has nothing to hide about them being just friends. He said he didn't tell me because of how he thought I would react and it wasn't a big deal. He also said we were early in the dating phase.

I got upset because I didn't know he saw her. Seemed odd. I asked him for honesty and transparency and took time to process. The next day I wanted to address this situation in detail after I had time to think. He called me and said in an effort to be more transparent, he wanted to let me know he put an offer in on a house. I had no idea he was house shopping or even going through the process. His realtor ended up being a mutual friend of him and his ex.

It might not be any of my business about the house, fine but it triggered me because the withholding the information of seeing his ex transferred to feeling like he withheld to share such an awesome process with me, even if just for moral support. I immediately asked if his ex knew he was house shopping and he shut down and broke up with me because he couldn't believe that was the first question I asked instead of being excited for him. He said I reacted emotionally and that's not for him.

Fast forward, we try to work it out. I go to his house and see him hide something. It was a printed out picture of him and his ex on a very important date that I was with him on. On that date he left me after lunch to go nap at his place but the picture showed that was a lie as he actually went to go meet up directly with her. She printed the picture out and gave it to him as a gift to commemorate the special occasion. He swears they are just friends, again. I am not sure if this is the same day that he initially saw her when I mentioned he saw her in my above statement.

I told him I have ran out of tolerance for dealing with his ex in the middle, even if she is just a friend. He decided to cut ties with her. He told me he was going to take her to dinner to cut ties with her. Two hours had passed since they had been at dinner to have the talk. I called and asked, how are you and why did it take so long? He immediately shut down and broke up with me days later because he said instead of using that as a time to connect with him and ask deeper questions, I asked why did it take so long. He said his actions are not appreciated, he did this for me and I could of asked how it went or how he was feeling. I could have used it as a moment to deepen our connection and he said from these two instances, I use his vulnerability against him. He says I lack trust in him and he just wants a peaceful connection. Am I tripping here?!

He says I have a pattern of making him feel defensive when he takes actions to show he is serious about me. I said, I just needed him to communicate better since his ex situation has been so uncomfortable for me. The example I gave was, he could of updated me saying I am on the way to see her, I know this might but uncomfortable for you but I will call you directly after and we can talk about everything.

He didn't want to see my side and now he says we are incompatible because of my behavior instead of trying to work through this together. I am sorry this is so long but my mind is going wild and I just need insight from fellow humans. I have no problem with accountability. I'm always trying to work it out.

I'm 23f, and I recently broke up with my all-of-college bf who I was with most of my adult life. 

I'm at a bit of a loss because I've never really had any traditional dates, beyond random high school flings. My ex and I met in college and kinda had a natural transition from friends to lovers pretty quickly. It was easy with him, and it never really seemed like there was much pressure, things just flowed. 

Now I want to start dating again, and I have no idea how to go about it. I've never even had a dating app and I don't have any clue what people look for on there. 

I know the typical ""just be yourself"" advice and want to stay true to that, but I also just genuinely don't know what things are standard in dating these days. Like, what kinda pics do people look for (group, selfie, portrait, etc), what makes a bio stand out? Does it matter if I'm not super happy with my job rn, should I just say what career I'm working toward? 

I wanna put my best foot forward, but I also want to be authentic. I'm really afraid my prof won't give off the right vibe since I'm not familiar with the process.

I’ll introduce myself with a bit of background first, then explain my situation with the relevant context.

I’m a 23 year old male living in the SE United States, finishing college (chem + Econ), and heading to medical school in the fall. I’m white, 6’1”, 175 lbs, athletic/good looking (like 7-8/10 in the face with a good physique), have had 21 sexual partners, 2 girlfriends, have a reasonably strong social life, a close knit friend group of both men and women, and am generally doing quite well for myself despite a brief bout of depression. I’m an avid rock climber, amateur stand up comedian, and run a local food critic Instagram account. I actively attend therapy and go on mountain retreats once a month to clear my head. I’m friendly with my exes and both have great things to say, as I’ve heard them speak about me through the grape vine and to my face.

As of late, I’ve been slowing down the casual sex thing. Only 2 new partners in 2022 so far. I am now considering getting a girlfriend with whom I can build a strong connection and create a healthy, mutually beneficial partnership. I have a few stumbling blocks that I’ll discuss here.

About half of my sexual partners were first contacted via a dating app (hinge). I have come to be dissatisfied with my experience on Hinge, and no longer feel that it’s worthwhile. The match quality tends to be highly variable and frankly I don’t feel like the investment (e.g. money/time spent on a date, emotional energy, etc) is worth the potential, but unlikely, end result of finding a woman to whom I see a future with. Many girls just want sex or a fling, and that isn’t what I want. I want a partner, but lots of college girls don’t seem to be interested. I have been told by women that my confidence is often “intimidating at first”, and for that reason among others, I get labeled as a “fuckboy” despite the fact that I am an emotionally adept man who is seeking a bond with someone. I also talk openly about my feelings and do not shy away from mental health topics. 

What is the most practical and efficient means by which to facilitate finding and building a relationship with a great woman who WANTS partnership? I am a stable person both emotionally and financially, and have a great track record at maintaining long term healthy friendships. I always hear that women want relationships and are tired of men treating them badly… I genuinely want to (and do) treat women well, but finding a great partner is serving to be a more difficult challenge than I initially anticipated. Where do I find these women? Am I getting ahead of myself and rushing this? Is this a waste of time to even consider a gf before entering medical school? I’m confused and a little agitated right now because the thought of waiting until after med school to find a gf really sucks. Any advice appreciated, and I hope y’all have a great day!",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164910,public,self,"M23 med student. Labeled as an f-boy, but want relationship.

I (19f) broke up with my long distance bf (18m) over FaceTime last night. We have been together for almost a year and we both still love each other. He goes to college that is 5 hours away from our hometown whereas I commute 40 minutes to my college. So I only get to see him in the summer and breaks. Every time he leaves to go back I’m crying, and throughout the time we aren’t together I miss him so much it hurts. I know this was probably the best thing to do as it was causing me pain. Also after seeing my twin sister with her bf of 4 months (they are not long distance) made me realize, even more than I already did, is that I need to be in a relationship where I can see them in person on more than just the breaks. I know we are both young but we also want different things in the future, like he wants kids and I don’t. He always tells me that we are only freshmen in college so we can still change our minds, but I know for sure I won’t. He said he would change for me but I think he is too young to make that decision and the distance is the main reason for the breakup anyways. And I think the only reason why I am focused on the kids thing is just to give me more validation I did the right thing.

Anyways how the hell am I supposed to deal with all the pain and hurt? I know I have caused him a lot of pain and he has some mental issues and depression and I don’t want him to hurt himself or anything. We have texted everyday any time that we could for almost a year, I don’t know how I’m just suppose to stop all of that. I just need help. He was my first relationship so I know I shouldn’t have thought it would last, and I was the one to end it, but it hurts so much. 

The week before spring break we had a phone call about how hard it was, and he asked if I wanted to breakup but I said no. He told me that we should just last until the end of summer so we can have the summer together, and then we could part ways when the fall semester starts so we could end in a less awful way. I really wanted to give him the summer, and it was my plan to, but I couldn’t help but have all the doubts. And I realized that if I spent the summer with him, I wouldn’t want to let him go and I would go through all the hurt of long distance all over again.

Also he told me he wants me to be his first for sex, and I still want him to be mine, because the only reason we haven’t yet is because I’m not on birth control yet as the place I’m going to is super popular so I’ve been wait for months for the appointment. I’m scared though that it will just rekindle feeling.

If you made reading it this far I just want to thank you for sticking by. I’m just in a lot of pain and I need help learning how to get over someone I still love. Thank you so much!

He also did mention he wanted to cook me dinner sometime. The night ended and I had such a great time! We kissed goodbye and went our ways and texted each other we had a great date. 

We texted the rest of the week and he kept telling me how he wanted to see me so bad, and I felt like he was coming on a little strong and he said he wanted to see me on Saturday and I said sure I’d love to see you again even though I saw him 4 days ago. He asked if I wanted to come over and he can cook me dinner or get a drink.

He then texted me saying “don’t hate me, but I got invited to last min birthday thing for my friend” and I said “no problem, we can find another time!” I didn’t really mind since I got a horrible sleep the night before so I was happy I could relax at home, though was a little bummed he did it last minute. Then he didn’t text me for 2 days then I posted a picture on Snapchat and he saw it and he decided to text me right after he saw the picture saying “hey” and I said “hey! How was your weekend?!” And he said it was great and that I looked super good in my picture I posted, and I said thanks even though I felt like he only texted me cause of that.

I hope you feel better how are you doing?” And I responded how I felt and then he never responded to me, then deleted me off hinge 4 days later. 

I feel like he ghosted me because all he actually wanted was to hook up, and me being sick meant he had to wait longer and maybe he even lied about having a friends birthday because I didn’t want to come over to his house and he really didn’t want to get drinks again.

I’m not talking about love specifically, cause i know it’s almost impossible at my age ( M18 ). I’m talking about attraction in general. 

For instance, i’ve never dated anyone. Sometimes, i didn’t like the girl involved. Some others, she didn’t like me back. Not their fault, not my fault. 

It’s just that it seems unrealistic to me. I mean, i lost tons of friends cause they found a special girl that made them feel great, and so they had no time left for me. 

But i’ve never experienced such a good feeling. I came to think this because yesterday my crush cried in front of me cause a music that was being played reminded her of her ex. They broke up due to distance.

So, another time, i thought a girl i liked liked me back, but found out the harsh truth. I’m tired of living my life like a secondary character.

I know there are similar questions on this sub reddit already but I felt a lot of them were context driven and thought it might be worth it to give it a shot with mine.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a girl I know for about 8 years now. We've been friends since college and over a period of time  we've become closer as friends. At this point we text and talk daily over whatever topic. Whenever (or at least I think whenever) she's feeling low or not good about something she calls me up and we talk at length about it. Other things related to her life such work, family, etc are all something we talk very frequently about. She also tells me about the guys who ask her out and why she's not interested in them. We joke all the time and really understand each other, there are times when we don't even need to say a lot and the other person just gets it. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I really like talking to her and if there's a chance that we could be dating that would be absolutely great. But since we know each other for such a long time, I don't want to make it awkward for her by asking her out if all she was doing was considered me to be a good friend. I don't want her to feel that she cannot confide in me anymore just because I think of her as more than a friend. Another spanner in the works is that we are not in the same city.

Even though we worked at the same store we had different employers. Anyways I would talk to her normally and causally.  After a while at the job, I would hang out with at the desk of a lesbian co-worker whenever I wanted to take a prolonged break. lol. Anyways it turned out she would do the same and hide out there. So the three of us would hang out and she saw my funny side. I can come off as a serious nerdy type, but I can be very funny. To the point where people have mentioned I am wasting my life , and should be a comedian. The two of them interchanged Instagram and she asked for my Instagram. Even though she already had my phone number for professional purposes.

Anyways we started hanging out more at work and talking.  One time she mentioned she works out, and I mentioned that we go to the same gym. I asked if she wanted to work out together and said yes. I honestly didn't ask to hit on her since I have low confidence and I don't mind just making friends. Anyways we go and workout for about two hours, but then her friend showed near the end. Her friend doesn't drive and for some reason she got dropped at the gym to hitch a ride. I don't get it but didn't ask.  We never worked out together because she flaked out on me since she said she wanted to motivate her friend to get into the gym. That friend of hers I noticed has a fear of men, so I get that they wouldn't want me there. But I did get upset because we were supposed to work out together and she never cancelled with me, she just flaked.

I figured she just wasn't interested on me but then, she started making comments about her ass on the break room. And she asked the lesbain friend what she thought of her ass. The lesbian friend said she had an ok ass. She looked disappointed so I told her she had a great ass, she does and knows it. She was asking for the attention. Anyways she started jumping and got really exited at my co comment. So I thought maybe she is interested, but when I text her she takes forever to respond.

Also, I would do sweet things for her like go out and buy her lunch because unlike her I didn't have to clock out to go to lunch. But then I totaled my car  and she never offered to get me lunch even though she knew I didn't have a car to go out and buy something. This actually upset me because one time when she out to lunch she texted me. I thought she would ask if I wanted something, I would have payed for my own stuff of course. But instead she texted if I could please clock her out. So i did clocked her out , but then I blocked her. She definitely noticed because she tried to talk to me afterwards but I avoided her work area.

A few days later I actually got promoted at my job so I left the store and went to work at my employer's office. I unblocked her and requested her again and she accepted me.

So we were seeing eachother for over a month. We’ve gone on dates and I’ve spent the night and even stayed there to sleep in when he would have to leave to go to work. We would also text about everyday. I’d say we saw eachother once a week. We didn’t hook up all the way (sex) until the fourth date and that’s when he agreed to be exclusive. He knew that I needed that in order to have sex. 
Eventually over time it got to a point where we’d both mention how we need to get together soon and he’d reply that “we definitely do” but then he wouldn’t try to make a plan or if he was out and about during the weekend he would get too “black out “ to try and meet up.

So I’m assuming he isn’t interested but I don’t understand what went wrong? 
I’ve met his friends and even they were congratulating him on how I was a great catch and were even surprised that he could get with someone “out of his league”. 

I guess I don’t get how he wouldn’t want to see me to even hook up? He waited all this time to be able to hook up with me and now that we have reached that stage he doesn’t try and see me? We have only so far had sex 3 times. 

Another note is he did have a serious college gf of 5 years where they seemed very in love. I don’t know how she put up with his drug use but maybe he didn’t start using until after.

Also, have been dealing with a foot injury, that now that I have insurance, I can finally see what combo of things is happening that have made me absolutely mad/distracted over 8 long months.  i am into hiit running and generally like to walk and listen to music/ect., rather than TV/sitting/I kicked something too hard a couple of different times/I exposed my foot to toxic grout/tile mortar over a year due to a broken work shoe, and embarrassingly, did not have good socks changing hygiene at the time(nerve injury?)/may have stepped on glass.... as luck would have it, all this happened in a very short period, so maybe a combo of these things.  So the injury has taken a huge toll on my routines/lifestyle/wellbeing/future dreams.  Its not that I'm disabled, by far not, just easy to aggravate it, and it has a 'feeling' to it when I walk. 


Everyone talks about the likes/matches/dates they have. But, I'm the loser.  In fact, I have never had a g/f, and have barely ever kissed a girl.

This is kind of a long post but any advice on this would be much appreciated. To start, my Bumble profile lists my age as 26 because it’s going off my Facebook profile, which I made way back when I wasn’t old enough to make one. As a result, the age on my profile is exactly three years older than my actual one. As a “fix,” I added “I’m 23, not 26 (thanks Facebook)” at the end of my bio.
I know Bumble has a way to change the age to your correct one if you reach out to them. However, there are a few reasons why I’ve been putting that off. 

For one I’ve heard a lot of negativity attached to dating men around my age, primarily regarding reasons of maturity and independence. I don’t know how valid this concern is, but I personally see myself as quite mature and independent (I’m also currently in a graduate program for public health and I’m working part-time with my state health department. I’m very passionate about what I want to do and have a drive to climb up professionally). The second reason is similar, I’ve heard many women want to date men older then them because that’s what they’re attracted to for reasons mentioned in point one.

I’m not trying to lie about my age at all, and I’ve been very honest with my matches when they ask about it. I just feel like I have a slight edge with it when it comes to online dating because I can make it past more filters. I’m also on the shorter side (5’6-5’7), and I know that filters me out for a lot of girls, especially those my age or younger who I’ve found tend to be a bit more superficial about that kind of thing.
I’ve had this “mistake” in my profile for a pretty long time, and I’ve definitely had success. In fact, most of my successful relationships from the app have been with women 2-3 years older than me, and I’m aware these same ppl initially wouldn’t have never met me if my age was displayed correctly (they have told me as much themselves).
The reason I’m concerned about this now is because I’ve also been more worried that having this on might be turning matches away from me too, especially those my age and younger. As in, women my age or younger who I do match which don’t tend to message me, even if I extend. Personally, it would be nice to have more relationships with women my age and/or younger. 
I’m guessing I might come across as a catfish in a way because of this, and I know how much of a concern safety is for women in dating general, especially when it comes to dating apps. I’m also guessing that it comes across as lazy, which isn’t a desirable trait either.

Other than everything I’ve mentioned, I’m pretty confident in myself, how I look, and how my profile comes across. I’ve had decent success on Tinder with the same profile but where my correct age is listed, but definitely not as much as Bumble because I believe girls are looking for somewhat more serious connections on there and I think Bumble does a better job of match-making rather than limiting your success in order for you to buy into the app (which I believe Tinder does).
I’d love to hear the community’s thoughts on this, as I’m pretty conflicted at the moment. I’m mostly just worried that if I decide to change it, I know it can only be a one-time thing, and I’m worried my success will decrease dramatically on the app. Thank you for reading!

TL;DR: I’m debating whether or not I should officially correct my age on Bumble because I don’t want to jeopardize my success on it.
Edit: I should add that I’m turning 24 in a few weeks!

Final Edit: I was able to change my age to my correct one today. Thank you all for the input. It has opened my eyes to what it really means to be honest and mature. I understand it was wrong for me to be deceptive about my age, and I am excited to move forward on the right foot.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164918,public,self,Should I correct my age on my Bumble profile?

Our second date was very explicit, he asked me how long I can go in the bedroom and he shared he can go for two hours. Wouldn’t stop talking about how he weirdly has always dated girls with eating disorders and how he is in bed &amp; ased me what I like in the bedroom. This man set the tone for the rest of our encounters to be only sex related so we agreed it will only be sex. The first night he picks me up with his best friend and his best friends girlfriend, they do us the favor of driving us into the city from Jersey so we don’t have to take the train. I met his friends, they brought me dessert from the restaurant they were eating at, they were very warm and friendly. Fast forward we’re at his place &amp; he only wants to watch anime with porn in it so we do, we get in the mood, we start having sex. After of about ten minutes of combination of oral play and doggy he cums. Not 2 hours after all.. lol. So now it’s my turn to get mine right? About 10 minutes pass of oral and my back hurts &amp; I’m uncomfortable so I ask him to take me to the bedroom. He seriously replies with “the bed is off limits” I ask him why, he says “that’s where I sleep and it’s private so it’s off limits” I kiss him in the neck and I say “take me to the bedroom it’s okay” and he carries me, we continue but I can tell he goes soft and somethings off. I felt uncomfortable and btw he does not let me stay over so it’s getting late and he lives in Brooklyn I live in jersey so I rush myself to cum and that upsets him even more. I get ready, leave. He doesn’t talk to me. I message him to follow up on our plans for this weekend and he says to me, “I’m still processing our last encounter, I felt like I was being graded and held up to a high standard. It felt like there was an expectation from you that it would be an epic marathon, I said the bed was off limits and it didn’t feel like you respected that boundary. You pushed till your got your way.

We found out early that we’re both attracted as well. She honestly told me she doesn’t want anything serious but stupid me not playing it cool said I want something serious. We left it at staying friends, she got together with someone else. Long story short she got together with a jealous control freak and we could barely talk or text so I told her we shouldn’t talk anymore and leave it as it is.


2 years go by, 3 months after their breakup she adds me back on social media. She tells me she never forgot me and cried for me a lot and she has emotions for me and she is sorry about everything. We started spending a ton of time together online: playing all kind of games, talking until 5am, watching videos together, etc. We discussed how much we missed each other and what we’ll do once we’re together. However she did warn me she is moving abroad soon and doesn’t want a long distance relationship but she COULD postpone it if we become a thing. 


Eventually we met a guy online in a match and we added him to play with him in the future. The guy is from the country she’s moving to. A week later she starts playing with him without inviting me (and knowing I have free time to play) and sometimes telling me she is not in the mood to talk yet she played with the guy. When we played together she kept talking to him like she did to me (kinda flirting). They started watching shows online together. They started talking until late night while saying bye to me at 1am. She even said she really likes spending time with him. I asked her what is up because I feel like he became her focus. She told me she didn’t do anything and I shouldn’t be jealous and it’s all in my head.


Next day she tells me she is flying to said country and she will meet him but once again, I shouldn’t be jealous of him. Through the 3 days we barely text, but that’s fine. She comes back from abroad and spends even more time with him. At one point the 3 of us were playing and he left and she just said “ok let’s go to sleep then”. I left it as it is.


We meet IRL for like the 4th time in 2 months, we drink and sleep together. I ask her what the hell is going on. She tells me she is moving abroad soon and doesn’t want a long distance relationship and she feels like I’m weighing down on her by wanting to be together while she wants to be with someone else. We keep fighting through text and she says that “If I had any doubts about being with anyone else now you made them go away with this jealousy”. We didn’t talk for a week after this and I finally ask her what’s up. She tells me things are moving forward with the guy and we can only talk if we are friends only and nothing more as she doesn’t want a relationship with me.


Was it wrong from me to voice my concerns? Did my jealousy just push her into his arms or it was just victim blaming?

I really like him and he treats me well but there’s something that he does that bothers the shit out of me. I try not to think about it too much but sometimes it just comes up on my phone because that’s how things go. He follows this girl on IG, Twitter, AND Letterboxd who is so adorable. She has pink and purple hair and she wears these giant glasses and she has this winged eyeliner and she always looks so good and every single one of her posts is a picture of her face. She’s definitely just posting for attention and that’s fine but she has my guys attention and that’s not OK with me. I envy her in many ways. I do not look like her, I have blonde hair and blue eyes and my body is more curvy than hers is and it makes me so uncomfortable because she’s like this tiny brown-eyed freckled pixie. He comments on almost all of her posts with things like fire emojis or just saying “Oh my Lawd” or something like that. I have not brought up with him that I know about this, but I’m reaching a point where I think that I should. I know that he cares about me but I feel like I shouldn’t even have to say to somebody who is in a relationship that it’s not OK for him to be commenting on other girls posts. Oh and the worst part is that she only has like 1000 followers so she sees it every single time he comments on her stuff. There are barely any pictures of him on his page and he is such a shy person I seriously doubt that he would ever reach out to her nor would she be able to look at him and get interested, PLUS we live thousands and thousands of miles from where she is, and I know that she does not follow him back, she probably just thinks that he’s an orbiter. But it makes me uncomfortable and I don’t know how to bring it up with him in a way that doesn’t make me look “crazy.” Probably the worst part about this is that I am in my early 20s and he is in his late 20s, so he should know much better.

Mostly because of lack of trying, and the lack of trying because I knew I wasn't someone anyone would want to be with, I was a boring sedintary stoner who lived in his mom's basement and had no plans for my life.

 But I recognized that and did something about it, I'm now an avid rock climber, lover of photography and hiking. In the last few months I moved from Seattle Washington to central Florida in order to start apprenticing as a pool repair technician. So no more hiking but I can still climb at the gym and go out to take pictures. But I still live with my father while apprenticing, my grandfather lives with us as well and my step mother works from home so the house is quite literally never empty.

Everywhere online I see that someone my age should have a career and a car and their own place, and that lacking any of these is a big red flag. I would like to try out the dating apps I hear so much about  but seeing what I have is pretty disheartening, both in regards to where I should be in life and the outlook in general for males on dating apps.

What ends up happening is you have an inexperienced guy who takes this advice to heart, goes out on a date in the real world, and him asking just makes everything weird. For example:

Him: Hey Jane Is it okay if I hug you hello?

Jane: Hi! Sure...

Him: (20 minutes into the date) Is it okay if I place my hand on top of yours?

Jane: Umn I guess?

Him: (End of date) Can I kiss you goodnight?

Jane: Noo

Him: Can we settle for a hug?

Jane: ...I guess.

So what ends up happening is Jane goes on a date with a confident man a week later who doesn't ask for shit. He just reads the room and makes move accordingly. Jane naturally feels A LOT more chemistry with the confident man.

All the awhile our confused guy is now even more confused since he got rejected doing EVERYTHING he was told to do by women all the while Jane is now in a relationship / having sex with the guy who read the room as opposed to asking.

Now our confused guy is even more confused convinced that women are just attracted to douchebags.

Better advice is: Learn to read the room as opposed to autistically asking over every little thing.

I have issues with intimacy and am usually on the verge of a full fledged anxiety attack and I'm starting to notice a pattern of alcohol pre or during dates. I guess I'm scared my real personality can't shine through the anxiety. In the past my anxiety was the cause of one going completely up in flames and it served as a sort of confirmation that i'm more likable drunk unfortunately (he didn't want to have sex with me anymore because I was acting really jittery and flighty).  I just don't know how to be confidently open otherwise?

Two nights ago i went on a date with this guy who i really found cute, and i was super shocked! He was so handsome and so nervous, a little bit on the straight side, maybe inexperienced, sorta in the same boat as me drinking wise i came to notice. And i found myself being disappointed, the conversation wasn't flowing, he found it difficult to look at me, i started to worry i didn't live up to the expectations i put out online, i was sad that this was another story to add to my list. Everything in me said go home, find an excuse and go home. Instead he asked if i wanted to go to a concert with him, i said yes. We're at the concert, binge drinking, and i start acting really embarrassing from the alcohol: started kissing circles with strangers and including him in them (accidentally asked his friends to join) telling him i'm going to do coke in the bathroom and that i'll be right back. I even tried to get him to scream some gay shit for fun of course, but i don't trust my own motivations sometimes, i wonder if i did it because i didn't accept him fully and tried to change him somehow. I also asked him if he really wanted me there because he kept leaving me at some points and i wanted to know if i should focus on having my own fun or trying to have fun with him? After all that, despite it all, i noticed how much he wanted me, and the fact that he wanted me, to me, was more important than how much i liked him. we made out, he did this old timey sort of dance where he took the lead and i felt smitten a bit. So when he asked me if i wanted to come to his place after, i had no idea why i felt a huge NO in me, and why i said ""yes"" instead.

Even afterwards i'm cherishing these small moments and holding onto them along the backdrop of the entire date which was not that good to begin with. I'm realizing that i would be willing to experience things with him, teach him things about queer culture, almost baby him? let him confide his fears in me, and i think it's because i think i need someone to need me? Not for some dark malicious purpose, but i grew up being parentified by my mother and i think this is obviously an extension of that. Is this just my version of affection/intimacy/love? And is that ok?

It's almost like there are two dialogues happening: the real one and the one that is desperate to form some kind of connection between another person often at the expense of myself. I'm fighting this intense sense of inferiority, combating it with alcohol and sometimes becoming an asshole in the process. If it helps paint a better picture at all i was abused as a kid, and i'm just wondering if at some point dating gets any easier. I'm 24, have been on 4  or 5 dates in my whole life, most of which have been shit. If i try again i can't imagine myself trying seriously if at all.

I always offer to pay. Guys usually pay for me.

See a lot of posts on Reddit about everyone paying their own way on dates.

I’d be totally happy to pay for myself if I could skip the makeup and hair care and shaving and waxing and nails. I do not think guys would like to date me if I showed up in that way, though. However, I would greatly prefer to skip the beauty routines. 

A lot of guys I have gone on first dates with show up in ripped shirts and with mediocre hygiene. I just feel like those are the guys who post the most on Reddit about you paying for yourself.

You cannot have it both ways, either you want traditional femininity in your partner and are willing to drive her/take her out, or you want an egalitarian relationship where the girl spends as much time on her appearance as you do.

It’s a headache to read this stuff.

Edit: I am pretty ambivalent on it overall. If I could save $75-$100 a month on getting my vagina waxed, and $50 a month on makeup, and $25 a month on eyebrow waxing, and $200 on skincare every three months, I would be so happy to go Dutch on dates. I have tried skipping the above and I can promise you men did not talk to me as much. (The one thing that made no real difference was nail care, which is why I didn’t include it here. However, when I got my nails done, men still commented on how much they liked them.)

Edit 2: the point is that the guys posting about women paying for themselves are not going after women who don’t wear any makeup

Edit 3: this is not about me, this is about whether or or men who want to go Dutch are OK with women who make no special effort (past basic hygiene) like above on date. That’s all!

Meeting someone else who is compatible and wants the same things feels so impossible.  The guys my age generally want to date younger women.    I’m just feeling very down about prospects of having this life I dreamed about and came so close to having.  I wanted it with him, but I’m trying to hold onto hope that there’s someone even better out there.  Does anyone have any encouraging, motivating stories about dating in similar circumstances (particularly in late 30s)?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164922,public,self,Need a pep talk,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/trea67/need_a_pep_talk/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,

But in reality yes you get that instant attraction is that a spark sure. But yes you will never hold onto that initial spark. Sometimes you realize that you are opposite, but to say ""spark is gone"".
 Is more of I'm not willing to work on anything. So next time anyone says no spark. Ill probobly just say.. ""well that's good to know we're just opposite then.
