 I’m curious of why people forgive, because of how much time they invested into that person? Because “they know” it won’t happen again? Because they “weren’t in the right mindset”, afraid of being alone?, afraid to let go? Because they didn’t get the attention/ emotion they wanted? Because they were young at the time?

 I really want to know why people forgive. Yeah cool, people make mistakes but cheating? Nope. I’ve been cheated on twice in my teen years. [23M] Now.

 [15yrs old] Once with my first gf because well she “wasn’t in the right mindset”, forgave her then it happened again. That’s when I developed that once a cheater, always a cheater mindset.

 [18yrs old] Second with a girl I was dating for about a month. She wasn’t over her ex after she said she was, but long story short I drove to her ex’s house (gut feeling) to see them in her car getting it on so I ripped him out the car and took my angry and frustration out by beating him( ik I shouldn’t have, lesson learned).

 Now if I ever come near the sense of a girl  I’m with cheating or what I think is possibly cheating, then I just leave. Yeah it sucks, but I know my worth. I do it for the sake of my mental health from past experiences.

 Not trying to purposely come off negative, but I could never forgive someone again.

 For those that forgave and y’all live a happier life now, then let me know why you should forgive.

 For those that didn’t forgive and moved on, let me know if you are glad you made that decision.

We also really enjoy each other's company....also PS I'm divorced &amp; so is he. 


Last night I finally had it with him &amp; cursed him out over text after our FT call was a complete fail. (Something I don't do bc I like to keep my cool) 
I had a moment where I decided to be vulnerable with him (aka test the emotional capability waters)...&amp; Also I've held back from being vulnerable for as long as I can remember. He considers me to be the only person in his life who he can be real with.( Good for him but what about me)

Me: I've just been feeling lonely this holiday season alot has been going on

Him: How are the animals? *Him realizes how completely fuxked up that avoidance question was*

However, he was consistent and we finally went on the first date around 3weeks ago. He was gentle and we matched well. He said he wanted to develop us to getting jnto relationship but I rejected cuz it was too fast for me. Funny part was, we hooked up on that night. Everything went great. 
We got breakfast in a cafe, and his stance on me(developing our relationship) was the same.


After keep texting everyday for a week, he visited my city again and we went on the 2nd date(without hookup). 
While drinking coffee, he said
 ""Even if I know we are going to take things slow, I just want to focus on you. Don't worry, getting into relationship will be far from now but I just want to only focus on you. How do you think?""


That was a really sudden question but I thought it was sweet. I said that it's a good idea. We spent more time there, walked together and he took me to the station with a kiss.
After texting everyday for a week again,  tomorrow is our 3rd date and I'm going to his city this time.


And while thinking about him... I just realized I didn't get the exact meaning when he said he wanted to only focus on me and he wanted me to do so.

I thought she was just playing with my hand, until she outstretched it and applied her palm and fingers against mine:

""You have really small hands""

I looked over and noticed mine were slightly bigger than hers during this comparison of hers and made a point of it, but she noted she was small and petite so that was saying something about them. I tried to take it away before she placed my wrist between her thumb and index finger and was able to connect a ring around me with them. Immediately that sucked a little bit of the magic out of having someone idly playing with and touching me, and quickly I remembered all the times other women did finger-ring-wrist thing and had nothing to say about it, now wondering what they were thinking. She did some pretty awful other kinds of comparisons, so I put it down to her being insensitive and a weirdo.

I'm talking to someone new now and she's pretty infatuated with me. We haven't met yet, but she keeps talking about how hands are one of her favourite parts of a man's body. She's obviously eager to see mine, and now I'm insecure she'll be disappointed when she sees their small and not veiny.

i have a bestfriend (Let's call him ""Alex"") who's 7 years younger than me

I'm 31 (Female) and he's 24 years old

We have a group of friends and we're very close (Like a family) and i'm the oldest one (the 2nd oldest is 30) and Alex is the youngest of the group

I met Alex when we were kids, he was only 7 and i was 14 and he was a really shy kid, didn't really have any friends so my mum asked me to become friends with him, well we became really close friends eventually, i would always talk to him first since he doesn't really start talking until someone starts first, we play games, there's this lake nearby our house and no one really goes there and it has become our favorite place to hangout, especially when we see the sun set and that's when it's our que to go home

few years later and we met bunch of our friends and we became a group, more like a family, Alex and i are still close as before, sometimes one of our friends would joke about it which i didn't pay any mind to it

We both care about eachother, and know our habits and what we like and don't like, despite of me being older i was actually the one who's a cry baby, emotional (But no i'm not a childish person) and he was the one who acts strong one (even after i catched him crying when he watched titanic)And him being shy was slowly disappearing and starts being a playful friend (playfully disses us and especially me being an old grandma, which i don't mind, i have patience toward kids)

He seems to know me really well, i think more than anyone who's close to me, he's an observant type

He always makes me laugh with his jokes and when does funny things, he's also obsessed with kiwis (which i despise with my soul) but it makes him get in a good mood when he's down so i do buy it for him

6 years ago Alex told me he liked me, that time i did have an attraction to him but he was only 18 that time and thought maybe i'm just his ideal type of girl and it's just a small crush (well most teens has a crush right? i did too when i was in HS) 
so i shrugged it off and told him that he's just young and it's just a crush, he did deny that and told me he was sure about his feeling but i kept my word, he's a teen and and i'm adult and that is not right

We decided to drop that topic and continued to be friends like nothing happened, but he started to hug me and tried to flirt but failed

3 years later i started to have feelings for him and it was really bothering me, never told anyone because they might find me weird to like someone younger, i started to see him as an adult but i feel insecure, he still kept being affectionate with me, i get nervous whenever he's close and i always see his face in my mind and dream

Few weeks ago he confessed again to me and i told him about our age difference, he lashed out saying he's an adult now and age doesn't matter (He's not the type to get angry easily but i think he get fed up with me thinking about our age), He left after that and it's been awhile and he's avoiding me, doesn't answer my texts or calls and he mostly stays at his apartment, even our friends starts to notice, they told me he really did have feelings for me and it was obvious to them and they aren't gonna judge us if we became together

I don't know what to do. Should i go for my feelings or is this the right thing to do?

I did! And I still am with the woman 😊

I did not find my wife remotely physically or sexually attractive at first. We were friends, found out she had a crush on me for over a year from a mutual friend, thought about letting her down easy since I felt absolutely nothing for her other than being a friend, but my boys group made me realize that she's a super sweet woman and I ought to give her a chance, and we'll have been together for 7 years somewhere in March 2022. 

Hell, in general, a fair few of male friends are with/married to women who they didn't find attractive at first, but now, due to emotions, we feel that they're the sexiest thing on earth. So boys, try and be mature about it, and then, you'll end up finding a gem.

Hi everyone,

For the longest time I have struggled with dating. Girls were never into me, I was never into them. Since Covid started, I had a “glow up” where I improved myself in multiple ways and now I am the best version of myself.

For the first time, I am going out on a date with someone. She’s very pretty and a very cool person. However, I am kind of conflicted. 

I know I am not committed to anybody right now but if this girl ends up liking me and wanting more, I can’t help to think that I want to meet multiple women first. At the same time though, I have never gotten an opportunity like this before (going out on a date).

So my problem here is, should I just try to date her and attempt a relationship (if we click) or should I pursue more women and see who fits best with me.

First, some exposition: I'm 33 years old, have 0 dating experience, but work in medical sales, and thus, am capable of surviving in social situations. I'm also reasonably experience with women in bed and am not too intimidated by them at this point.

I recently cut video games cold turkey and have started working out and dieting. I also have started using dating apps and am trying to get a girlfriend.

Anyway, last Tuesday I went on a coffee date with a girl (33) who was waaaaay cuter than she looks on the app. She's also very successful, articulate, and just my type physically; she's ""perfect,"" imo. 

The date took place at a halfway point between where we both live. So about 30 miles in either direction. We both showed up precisely on time. I was dressed like shit in comparison to her: well fitting jeans, a hoodie (yeah, I know), but well groomed etc. She was dressed better and in a trendy way (sorry I don't know much about women's clothes). The first part of the date went well enough, introductions, a hug, then she started firing off some cookie cutter questions which I answered adequately. To be frank, I started to get a tad bored of the generic questioning and started to shift the convo a bit more towards funnier, yet intelligent topics. One thing I took away from the whole thing was that she seemed very intelligent and maybe, dare I say, nerdy. I also didn't get a connection feeling from my point of view, she's just attractive and articulate enough for me to want to see her again.

Now, the end of the date is where I'm quite sure I fucked up. She goes to the bathroom at like 1 hour, 10 minutes, which I assumed was he way of trying to mix it up. Also, a homeless person walked in and sat down right next to us. So she comes back, and I go, ""you want to go?"" She replies, ""yeah, let's go,"" like in this quick way. She remarks that the date lasted the perfect time for her to get through her drink and we walk out.

Lol okay, so mind you, this is my first date. While she's in the bathroom, I'm trying to figure out what to do next in this sequence of events. I text a friend, and we both conclude that I should try to change the venue. Personally, I'd like to take a walk, but what ends up happening is that we walk out to the side walk, she reaches for her mask, I get my mask and she starts saying something and then stops dead. I look at her and spend a brief second trying to digure out what she's doing. So I go, ""oh yeah, what was that?"" Motioning to her that she should say what she was about to say. She goes ""oh, nothing,"" and goes ""go ahead what were you going to say?"" At this point I'm like, ""oh yeah, it's cool if you don't want to because you have work in the morning... but did you want to do something else?"" I say this in kind of this nervous manner lol, but to be frank, at this point we are both having a really hard time competing our sentences. She goes, ""oh yeah, I have work in the morning"" like in this really quick way. She goes, ""wait, do you work tomorrow?"" And I go, ""uh I do, but at like noon, but it's cool."" 

Lol and then we both stand there like looking at each other. I'm patting her on the back/shoulder and I go, ""you're great, haha you're great."" Lol I say this 3 fuckin times and pat her 3 times. I go, ""sorry i dont have much dating experience(big mistake, maybe the dagger). She goes, ""oh really?"" She smiles, I smile, then I'm like ""alright cya later!"" We both leave.

Lmao so obviously not a good way to end it.

That was last Tuesday, my female coworkers suggest I ask her out again on Wednesday, my sister suggests Thursday, but I'm so eager to see her again, I go with Wednesday, which was probably a mistake. She says she is busy this weekend but would be down to do something next week.

That night and Thursday night I try to text her some more so that I can talk to her. She definitely takes a long time to respond back (but to be fair, this has always been what she's done). Haven't texted her today or yesterday, and am planning not to do so until Sunday to ask her on another date.

Was really fun. Started lead climbing again. Feels amazing to use my body to its full potential again. And I'm thankful that I can still do it at 32. 

I'm just so thankful for being alive. Being able to experience what I've experienced.

About three years ago I made a calculation. I calculated that the city that I was currently living in of about 4 million people contained about 2000 women who were compatible with me for a longterm relationship. I was absolutely stoked!! I'm still single and living in a smaller city so I'm guessing it's down to about 1300ish. Still stoked! The other day I saw a guy on some random sub who made a similar calculation. He came up with a figure of 3000 in a city of about 2 million and he was absolutely bummed out by it. I thought to myself ""wtf dude?! That's awesome!"". 

Anyway the reason I bring up the calculation is that today I saw many beautiful and interesting looking women (I have a broad taste, something my friends have criticized me for in the past but I don't give a shit.) Seeing these women did give me a little pang of loneliness though. I so badly want to connect with someone and sometimes it feels impossible. That little calculation does give me some hope though. That maybe I'll meet one of them. I don't mind being single for a little longer till I meet her but god damn.

So my friend (26 M) sent me the link below and we actually both laughed about it and how oblivious the OP seems, honestly, I dont get a lot of options online, like I get matches but they eventually ghost haha and I thought there is no way girls would want to meet in person. I tried it yesterday...honestly it works pretty well imo. I know a lot of guys (myself included) thought OP was being condescending but yeah this is actually not a bad idea. So yeah, yesterday I approached 10 women and I got 4 rejections (2 claimed they were taken, 2 said they aren't interested), I got 4 numbers, 1 Snapchat and 1 Instagram, the girl who originally gave me her Instagram sent me her number after a few DMs back and forth. Ive had back and forth conversations with all the girls that gave me their numbers and the Instagram girl, I dont feel like I am carrying the conversation myself which is opposite to what I get on online dating. I actually had one phone call and she called me first! These are all women who imo are attractive and probably wouldnt respond to me online.

But yeah guys I think there is some merit to what she is saying honestly as condescending as she may be. If everything works out I have 2 dates in the next two days. It works I think at least try it out. Btw Im not like crazy handsome I can pm a selfie if you want, (5 foot 9, a little overweight) Im also not ugly lol and I have dimples so I think that may help. One more thing, 2 of the women that rejected me outright were Asian, Im black, so you may just not be peoples preference and thats ok. I got the best responses from black and white women. Anyways just thought to share this, maybe try it sometime ngl its nerve racking in the beginning. BTW I used the ice cream/ froyo suggestion the OP had and it worked very well.

Is this situation a pedestal?

Guy likes you. Is emotionally mature. Is talented themselves in many reguard. Has their life together, works hard. They like you. You and him both agree on almost every important issue. You're personalities are perfect and you never met anyone who has every connected with you on your frequency before. The guy actually listens and communicates openly with you. Never makes you feel unwanted,stupid. He believes in you, always brings good vibes and is excited with the career choice you want to make. The guys skills perfectly match what you want to do and he is excited to work alongside you to make it happen. The guy obviously adores you. Thinks you're the most amazing person he has ever met. And is willing to be by your side through anything. You genuinely love talking to him even though your an introvert. He doesn't hit on you, or sexualize you and obviously cares about you. But instead of focusing on the what ifs or the ""negative"" parts of yourself he would rather encourage you and adore you from the beginning. He is laid back and not ever judgemental. He accepts you for who you are now.

TL:DR got back with my ex after 2 years of breaking up. Wondering if I made the right decision

My first girlfriend broken up with me around 2 years ago due to difficult circumstances and her difficult to deal with parents. We then agreed to stay friends since before getting together we've been close friends for around 3 years.

Fast forward after two years of the initial breakup I went on trying to move on trying with different partners that I didn't truly click with the same with as her. A couple of blind dates and couple of relationships that barely lasted a couple months.

 Frustration started growing inside of me until one day I invited her out for dinner just to catch-up as friends since that's what we've been from the beginning I didn't want to lose that bond specifically.

What seemed like a dinner invite turned into a sort of date. throughout this dinner the tone and topics shifted towards dating. After she learned about my failures she confesses that she hasn't been in any relationship after the one we had and felt like she messed up due to the difficult circumstances at that time.

After a heartwarming exchange between the both of us and opening up more and more we end up agreeing that we should get back together.

She returned to her country (I live in the US, she doesn’t) and we talked sporadically. For some reason she grew to like me more and it was out of sight, out of mind for me. We both ended up in separate relationships at the time, but in 2019 she moved about a 2-3 hr flight from my city and we were both newly single so we started talking again. I was really depressed and unable to stay consistent so things stalled again, the pandemic happened and she ended up in a relationship with someone in her home country winter of 2021. She moved back home in summer of 2021 and I know I’m an asshole for this, but I started texting her a lot about missing her and she was in this relationship that was going nowhere. She saw it as an opportunity to confide in me about her current bf so I willingly listened but things got awkward when she suggested I get to know a friend of hers, who she insisted I’d really get along with. I pointed out it was awkward and she said not really since we never dated or slept together and that even though she was friends with this girl, they weren’t “best friends”. She really pushed it too, she kept sending pics, when I mentioned I liked something she commented that her friend also liked it. I made a somewhat suggestive comment about her chest size and she remarked that her friend’s are bigger and even sent a pic that showed her friend in an outfit that confirmed it. I found her friend attractive and finding out we have the same music taste and political ideas, I started to warm up to it. Same time the girl in question is on the verge of breaking up with her boyfriend and keeps referring to “us” as in her and i while simultaneously mentioning her friend. We even discussed baby names and marriage. Once her and her bf broke up I think there was an expectation that her and I would try things again, but as much as I liked her, I was kinda burnt out by the back and forth between us over the years (a lot of it my fault), confused by her former insistence that I talk to her friend, and at the same time intrigued by her friend. We had a convo where I admitted I found her friend’s Spotify and liked her playlists and she admonished me for being “super interested” in her friend. It’s just been weird. Now I’m at the point where I don’t think anything can ever progress with me and the girl in question and I’ve articulated this to her. But my conundrum is I want to reach out to her friend, I can’t ask her to introduce me (I’m not that much of an asshole) and even though I know her friend’s private social media accounts, I’d feel weird as hell requesting and messaging her. Was this all a trap at the end of the day? The idea of her introducing me to her friend? Am I wrong for wanting to pursue it? Should I just leave it alone?

Here's the nitty-gritty. 

This friend of mine in uni has been crushing hard on one girl for quite some time. He was also super shy about it, like, could not approach her if his life depended on it. And his reply to my offers to be his wingman was that he will ""play the long game until an opening presents itself"". He knows all her social media and basically stalked her without making any moves. 

So I decided to help the guy, organized a huge party month in advance, casually came up and invited her and her friend. And since we had different people coming from other faculties it wasn't weird, so she accepted.  

The whole month leading up to the party I planned several get-togethers with my friend, her and her friend, just the four of us. So we hung around at my place a couple of times, met up in the city, cafes, you know, stuff that friends do. During those meetups I would start discussions about things my friend could contribute as well as she would be interested to listen and just took the back seat or even left the room for a smoke or something, so they could talk. At some point even got them to kiss as a joke-dare. Everything was pretty much offered on a plate, yet my friend's participation was lukewarm at best, even though he was happy to hang around. Well, I hoped maybe the party's atmosphere would set up the mood and give him more courage.

Fast forward to the night, I am hosting the party, interacting with other folks, making sure everything goes smoothly. My boy seems to be doing fine, they danced a couple of times, saw them talking at some point, all is good. I am, on the other hand, either tending to guests or hanging out in the smoking room. Then, out of nowhere, she runs up saying she's been looking for me whole night and that we didn't do shots or danced at all. I just brush it off saying all good, we'll have time, but she insists. We do shots, after which she says that she ""doesn't feel good"", so I take her to the bathroom, where out of nowhere she locks the door, turns off the lights and well, the rest is history. You can refuse a girl in this situation only for so long and, well, I fucked up.

I came clean to him, we had a big argument about it. Settled our differences to some degree and carried on. We occasionally meet up, but it's not the same anymore. Regarding the girl - we're in a kind of fwb situation. I tried to steer this into a relationship, but she's too undecisive, so I just left it at that and moved on. We hook up from time to time, but nothing more. 

I still feel like shit about this whole thing. My only gripe is that with all the opportunities, meetups, parties, hangouts - he never made a move. In the end he puts the blame on me, saying I ruined everything and that this was my plan all along.

We haven’t acted on it because of time/space reasons.

Because of where this *wasn’t* going, I started talking to this guy (“Jake”). We talk everyday and he’s always so sweet. I wanted to meet up with him but apparently he’s always too busy to meet because of grad school. It’s been 2 months since we began talking, and we likely won’t meet, if ever, until he gets back home from Christmas next year. We have been fooling around on our phones/Snapchat but naturally, no actual sex.

During that time Jake’s told me that he’d like to continue to just talk to each other (and no one else) but I think I’m at the end of my rope for how long this can last in this state. Frankly I’m tired of asking him if he has time to meet up, because he never does.

He’s told me before that if I have someone who has more time than him that I’m more interested in he won’t hold it against me but I do have small feelings for him, despite not having met. However, because of the length of time where we haven’t met I’m getting the sinking feeling I’m being love-bombed for fun rather than actually pursued.

About two months ago I met this girl that I see every weekend on parties. She's the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. She never talks to me I can't tell if she's shy or if she doesn't like me but she hugs me all the time. I have a friend who I decided to get together with about a month ago because I figured it would never work with this other girl and because I'm lonely. I feel bad though because I have feelings for this girl and I feel bad for my girlfriend like I'm a bad person

I really do like this girl, she's says I brought back her smile and she can never wait to see me again.  I've met her friends, family and even her kids (recently), 

Tonight though, her kids were out all day with their bio dad (6yr ago broke up)
He dropped the kids off at 8.30 which is fine, then come 9.30pm we are cuddling up on the couch looking at her phone and a Snapchat pops up, it was her ex (kids dad)....queue another 10min and another Snapchat pops up, at this point I wasn't sure what to say, it happened directly in front of my eyes....I didn't know how to bring it up so I chose to ignore it and address it tomorrow when I'm over again.

My question is, I could myself be paranoid.....is this normal? Snapchat is photos unless I'm incorrect, I don't use these social platforms.....why would she and her ex of 6yr be snap chatting eachother.....

Any have any ideas how I can bring this up without coming across wrong?

We maybe went out 4 or 5 times. In the beginning he acted like he was genuinely excited about me and invested in this. On just our second date we spent hours talking about life and what we believed in and were interested in. He planned a picnic and would text me to ask about my day and actually wanted to sleep over at my place before I was ready.

The last time we saw each other we went further sexually than before and I asked him afterwards what he was looking for, which led to an odd conversation where he asked me to go first. I said I wasn't looking to move in with someone but an emotional connection is really important to me. He said he's moving in 6 months and how do I feel about that, and I said it's not an issue because I'm not necessarily looking for a super long-term relationship in that sense at the moment anyway. His response was ""okay, so casual then"" which was somewhat confusing but I assumed it was clear I wasn't just looking for casual sex. 

After that he was different. When we texted it was only flirtatious/sexting ish or him answering questions that I specifically asked him. He stopped asking anything about my day or showing any interest in me as a person and a week later made no plans to see me again. I thought maybe I was being too sensitive and should ask him out instead, so I did, but it turned out he had plans to go to 4 parties that weekend and when he did agree to meet up, planned on just having me help set up for one of the parties (that, by the way, he never invited me to). I told him let's do another time if he's too busy. He said he would let me know. At that point I was leaning towards breaking it off but at least wanted a conversation to make sure I wasn't wrong about him. I offered to bring him a coffee and we could go and just walk and talk for a few minutes. He said he didn't have time. The next day he suggested meeting up that week and I told him I just want to talk for a few minutes. He agreed to call me in the morning and never did.

I finally texted that he's obviously looking for something a lot more casual than me and we should stop seeing each other, but I was open to talking if I was wrong. He said I was probably right and he didn't want to overly invest in something at the moment. I told him to make it clear from the beginning next time because it's shitty to treat people differently once you have sex. He apologized and said he just changed his mind when I asked him what he was looking for and he realized he would be moving soon. I sent a long text basically saying you can still prioritize and treat someone as valuable in a short relationship and if he couldn't or wouldn't, he probably just wasn't interested. He never responded which I took as confirmation he wasn't interested. 

I texted him again a week ago for something totally work-related (long story) and he ended up saying sorry he didn't respond, he didn't know what to say and regretted not meeting up to talk because it's hard discussing feelings over text. 

It almost sounded like he wanted to talk more but I just told him if it didn't work out that is what it is, and we haven't talked since then. 

The fact is I miss him tremendously and think we had a connection that you can't fake. It was easier to think he was just using me for sex, but as tacky as this sounds I don't think he could have faked this level of feeling connected. I have kissed plenty of attractive people I had chemistry with, but have never felt this strong of a connection kissing someone, or had this experience of holding eye contact and both of us being content. He said that I had a calming presence, and when he looked at me sometimes he almost seemed like he was a little bit in awe. 

I have been telling myself that he clearly wasn't interested enough and if he wanted to he would have called me (it's been a month and he has not called or made any effort to reconnect). But part of me feels like what if this was just miscommunication? Is it possible I just responded too harshly (I did send a pretty harsh few texts) and he misses me too but thinks I wouldn't give it another chance? 

Anyway, I don't know if I'm being a pushover and have to accept he isn't interested and move on, or if it's possible this was just poor communication and maybe I pushed him away too fast or put too much pressure on it. My concern was just not feeling respected or like he valued me anymore but maybe it was too early to have that expectation.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1138802,public,self,Would it be a terrible idea to reconnect with someone who clearly said he didn't want to get invested?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjixr6/would_it_be_a_terrible_idea_to_reconnect_with/,no_ads,0,,,,,
