I added 2 months ago a girl in snapchat. We rly texted alot and things went rly well. We told each other stories, facts etc. etc.  We both felt like soul mates and she sayed she loves me after 1 Month. We wanted to meet eachother after that and the first trip (she had to use the plane. She is from Canada and I'm from Germany)  was canceled bcs she was corona positive. She was really sry and felt terrible, I said its okay this things happen. The second time she canceled bcs she was scared and felt terrible too. I never insulted her in any way and built her mood up that this things are normal.

Long story short, she just dissapeared from my snaplist and what is left is one picture i have of her on my phone. Her account is maybe deleted bcs. I downloaded the data and it showed ""no name"".

Im now clueless and don't know what to do. Try to find her via her pic or let this 2 months just fall. Im a type of guy where the majority of girls don't like my personality and I'm fine with it.

7,ndyle6,1621200912,Advice as I [27M] begin dating my best friend [26F},"I \[27M\] have been good friends with Kelly \[26F, not her actual name\] since my freshman year of college. We have always connected and got along really well and I consider her one of my best friends. We live in the city and started hanging out more after I broke up with my GF at the beginning of the year. Our interactions became more frequent and flirty before I realized we were both interested in each other as more than friends. I ended up asking her on a date, which went really well and ended in her staying the night at my place.

Fast forward to the present moment and I am trying to figure out what to do next. I think it's safe to say that we are both romantically interested in each other and want to see this through. I also realize that dating your best friend is a high-risk/high-reward situation. It's also slightly awkward. For 7 years our relationship has been platonic and now that's changing. She makes it easy but the transition from a friend to a romantic relationship is different.

My current plan is to ask her on another date and see how things go. On the date, I also want to have a talk about where our heads are at, what we're looking for and to make sure we're on our own page. Normally, I would never have a talk like this on a second date, but when its your best friend and there's an established connection, I think we're better off having that conversation than potentially being on different pages and hurting our relationship. Do you agree or am I better off just letting things play themselves out naturally? I will add that we had a similar talk after our date but were both pretty drunk so want to do it properly.

Any other advice on how to navigate this process would be much appreciated. Whether it's do's/don't, stories from personal experiences, or anything else I may not be thinking of - any and everything is appreciated! I want to make sure I'm very intentional and thoughtful through the whole process because our relationship means a lot to me. My biggest fear is that I mess up things up before we even get the chance to give a try and end up messing up our friendship.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ndyle6/advice_as_i_27m_begin_dating_my_best_friend_26f/

This isn't to be confused with ""thin because they are fit"" (although it can be a certain version of fit if the person is athletic, i.e. runs a lot, does yoga) because I know guys who don't exercise at all, but they're still on the slender side because they barely eat anything, and yet they always draw interest from more active and lean-bodied women who exercise/workout. 

I'm a pretty muscular guy in his 30s who works out daily -- like, you can see my solid abdominal wall, since I've got a lower body fat,  and I have a solid muscular build -- and I'd say that my lifestyle would compliment other health-conscious/active women, yet on the apps, the women who bother to hit ""like"" on my profile are hardly ever that. It makes me feel bad about my own self, because I interpret this to mean that despite the fact I have maintained and worked at being in great shape and staying active/healthy all my life (primarily for my health, physically and mentally, and not for superficial reasons) it's better to be a guy who doesn't workout at all and is soft-bodied just so long as you stay slender (and if you're tall on top of it -- jackpot.)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ndyo6r/do_slender_people_only_date_other_slender_people/

Recently sat down to think about how my dating life has gone the past few years. It seemed to be I was really good at attracting the guys that just wanted sex in the beginning. Then, it transitioned to attracting men who were looking for more of a caretaker type partner.

Basically, in the beginning of my dating journey I subconsciously thought all I had to offer someone was sex. When that passed, I thought all I had to offer was advice and guidance. 

Now, I'm sitting here thinking what I could possibly offer to someone in this part of my life because I do think it'll make a huge difference when I start looking. 

I feel like most of us don't really go into dating thinking about what we can give to someone else and the other kind of picks up on it for us. They subconsciously determine if what you have to offer is valuable for them. Therefore, you always attract the same kind of person.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ndyumn/what_you_have_to_offer_determines_your_dating_life/

I want a relationship and I want to be happy but my privious two relationships where far from nice, the first was 2 and a half years, witch I was physically and mentally abused by my gf, now its not a sad story totally I did get my daughter out of everything and I couldn't be happier but when I finally said enough is enough I'm worth more then my abuse. My life took a downward turn, my gf went to ss and the police and made several outlandish alligations that where all lies and this led to a full year of pain and suffering, it has been solved now thank god and I was finally proven to be telling the truth but that led me to fall for someone else's kindness. 

She used me for a child and then got rid of me, so I now have max my son.... 

The problem is after about a year of not dating battling to see my son and looking after my daughter full time I decided to start dating again, but everytime I talk to a woman online or once in person though we have since been talking on fb and she understands I freeze, just completely. They ask to meet up and I blow if off.... They want to go for a walk and I just say I'm busy, it's becoming a massive problem.

This isn‚Äôt the way I was hoping it would be at this point. But it happens. No one gets to experience everything. But everyone does get to experience some things. I‚Äôve experienced my portion and it is what it is. I don‚Äôt deserve or earn this by doing anything. You just get what you get and that is it.

I‚Äôve spent enough time invested in this though and I don‚Äôt think I can do it any more. I doubt sticking it out will change anything anyway.

No one owes me anything but I guess this ended up surprising me. I was sure when I became a doctor that that would be seen as a valuable profession in a date. But the reality is I don‚Äôt get to assign what professions are attractive and which are not for someone that is seeking a date. Or if where someone works even matters at all. I can only speak for myself. It surprised me that this essentially changed nothing but no one owes me a relationship because of what I do. That‚Äôs for sure.

I hoped that someone out there would find my hobbies and skills, the fact that I‚Äôm a vegetarian, my exercise routine, my travel history, and my lifestyle exciting. Or at least interesting enough or enough of a match to be good enough to give it a shot. But that‚Äôs not guaranteed. People are interested in what they are interested in and excited by what they‚Äôre excited by. If I‚Äôm not their cup of tea, that‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm not gonna be everyone‚Äôs cup of tea and they have every right to find someone that matches them well.

I get along really well and people are generally really surprised that I‚Äôve never had a girlfriend. Though, to be honest, what other response is that revelation going to induce from a friend. That doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean much. I think I am very cognizant of the degree that I am giving and taking in a relationship and think I make an effort to keep things fair. Lots of people say I‚Äôm ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù and ‚Äúnice‚Äù but I think most people could be described that way. Other people are free to see me as they see me, to interpret my personality according to what they see in me. I don‚Äôt get to tell them how they feel about me. So that doesn‚Äôt earn me any kind of objective value either.

It seems clear, surprising to me or not, no one has seen in me a good match for themselves. I don‚Äôt get to dictate that. But they have spoken. That seems like it would be a pretty unlikely circumstance but it seems to be where I have found myself.

And there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. I probably wouldn‚Äôt have been good for them. I don‚Äôt deserve anything from them. They know what they want. So it is what it is.

But I don‚Äôt think I can invest anymore of myself in this process. So this might be it. For a while at least. Maybe for good.

This is an account in which I was able to better understand true choosing signals from a false one. It will be helpful to you in your pursuit of finding your mate.

Here‚Äôs the story .. true story.

So I was loading my groceries into my car when I noticed a middle aged woman standing near the trunk of the car next to me. I was partially attracted at first glance, however the vibe I felt about her was disinterest. It seemed she was solely concerned with loading her groceries and leaving , she even appeared a bit irritated. I said to myself that I would not choose to pursue but that I would sneak a few glances to better judge if approaching would be feasible. Before I knew it she was walking past me to put her cart away. We locked eyes and she said ‚Äúhey how are you‚Äù , I responded with the same and then also added a flirty ‚Äúhave a good day‚Äù. We both entered our cars and sat there next to each other. As I pulled off she rolled her window down. A sign she wanted me to say something ? I had some trash in my car and a baby seat so I wondered why would she be interested in a single dad slob? But I pulled back into the parking spot , rolled down my window and I said ‚Äú this Israelites crazy , but are you single ?‚Äù She laughed naturally as her face lit up and responded happily ‚Äú no I‚Äôm married but thank you it‚Äôs very flattering‚Äù. To which I responded ‚Äúokay I know it‚Äôs crazy but you know sometimes I can‚Äôt tell which signals I‚Äôm picking up, have a good day‚Äù I didn‚Äôt feel rejected which is nice. I think acknowledging that this was going to be crazy before hand and getting straight to the point really helped avoid feelings of rejection. I took it as a chance to better learn choosing signals and calibrate my sensors for attraction. Sometimes people just want to be flattered and their not actually interested or available. I think the only way to know for sure is to ask.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ndzr12/choosing_signals_my_personal_experience_at_the/

I recently had a months-long situationship end and it has led me to be mistrusting of men's intentions.

This man was very successful, a bit shy, sweet, conversational and conventionally attractive. I was still on the fence if there was a physical attraction though. I think because of my recent breakup I may have been a bit quick to judge. But things were going well at dinner and he started asking about my morning plans (a bit of a yellow flag for me) and then invited me to come back to his place for a night cap (note it was only 9:30pm). Because of still being a bit hurt from the last guy I didn't feel ready to agree to ""spend the night"" with him yet and had just recalled how butthurt some men have been when I've gone back to then tell them that wasn't an agreement for me to have sex.

Anyways I politely declined and he walked me to my subway stop and waited with me until the train came. I totally thought I gave him the opening for a kiss but he didn't take it. We just hugged and I left. I texted him that night that I hoped he understood and that I'd still like to see him again. He replied back that he was really attracted to me and enjoyed our time together but was worried things were heading to the friendzone which is why he offered for me to come over. Now I interpreted this as because I didn't agree to go home with him that I was not interested. I replied that I appreciated his maturity and that I wasn't sure yet if we had romantic chemistry but that I was open to another date. He then said that he didn't see how another dinner date would change things but it was great meeting me. I told him I had been attracted to him and had wished he had kissed me goodnight but that I understood and wished him the best. He replied back this morning saying he wished he had and it may have made a difference and asked if I wanted to come to his apartment soon to hangout after work.

I may be too much in my head but I waited a couple hours and then replied that I thought the moment had passed for us unfortunately and that I didn't want there to now be that pressure on us to make a kiss happen but I thought he was a sweetheart and would make someone very lucky. I'm now regretting this and overanalyzing!! Was I too harsh/quick to make a decision? I guess all my past experiences had had the kiss organically happen.

She said that that was a sign that he is broke. I thought this was crazy but she said that most girls feel this way. We then asked a bunch of our mutual girl friends how they felt and literally all of them agreed with her. Like we asked more than 10 and they all said that it‚Äôs a red flag.

Now I‚Äôm a kind of a loser and have never been on a single date, so I‚Äôm very naive when it comes to this. Is this seriously a bad thing to do?

37,ne1eu3,1621209131,Update,"
Introduced myself to a girl i saw at the store i work at. She started sitting across from me on my breaks. I started talked to her. We started talking about school first, then transitioned into more personal topics like family. 

Started to become an everyday thing. She would always find me when i took my breaks and initiated the convo. Always had her full attention. She was always smiling/blushing. I could tell she was nervous this put me at ease because i was just as nervous. 

Started asking each other more personal stuff. Weekend plans what she does in her spare time. Shes new to my area and said she doesn‚Äôt really do much but work and school. 

She mentioned she was single three times to me but i was to scared so i changed the topic right away. She also told me some others had expressed interest in her but she wasn‚Äôt into them. Changed the topic from this again. 

Finally asked for her number and she gave it to me without hesitiation. Talked for a few days with her being pretty engaged so i asked her to hang out. 

She said she couldn‚Äôt because she had a family member at home that was vulnerable to covid so she tries to not to go out that much. I assumed rejection because of the insecurity that she was to pretty for me. 

Told her i wouldn‚Äôt talk to her anymore but she told me i didn‚Äôt have to do that as e really liked out relationship. I agreed after some convincing. 

The next time i saw her at work she had her hair and makeup done and just looked stunning. She found me on my break on my break and we talked for an hour. 

That night i texted  her tgat she was a great person and my friend but i needed space to get over my feelings for. She said she understood and told menot to worry about her. Now she will not talk t me.

43,ne245w,1621211264,"Should I confront him, disappear from his life or .... payback?","
I met this guy on Hinge about 2 months ago and we‚Äôve been almost inseparable (online). I haven‚Äôt met him because I am living in a different country for the time being until June when I will be back in his same city. 

The guy sends me love songs, pictures of everything he does and even pretends to be mad at me because I didn‚Äôt talk about him to my family, as if we were something more. 

Turna out I decided to travel for the week to where he lives, not because of him but because I have a business there and was visiting family. So i suggested we could FINALLY meet. I was arriving Thursday (May 13) and had an open ticket just in case things turned out ok. I told him and he said that he was busy that weekend because he had to travel to Orlando with his family on Friday and was coming back Sunday, so he said we were SURE meeting on Monday. 

The day i travelled came and i had heard nothing from him. I got to his city and just thought he might be busy or something so I didn‚Äôt text or anything. On Friday I reached out and asked him if plans were still up for Monday and he said he wasn‚Äôt sure because his family changed the day they were leaving to Orlando and he might be coming back Monday. I just told him to let me know. 

Literally like 5 minutes after we texted he added an instagram story and I obviously checked it out, and all of a sudden the story was nowhere to be seen, neither his highlights. The idiot thought i wouldn‚Äôt notice he had blocked me from seeing his stories. 

Anyway story keeps getting worse. On Saturday I was visiting a friend and she showed me a guy she had matched with on Hinge. IT WAS HIM! big asshole was texting with her. So i told her the whole story and she said she would obviously block him but first she asked him what he was doing on the weekend. The guy was never going to Orlando, had a dinner with friends on Saturday at his house and even invited my friend for lunch on Tuesday. MF

He obviously blocked me from his stories because he didn‚Äôt want me to know he stayed the whole weekend in Miami. 

So I am not sure what to do! Should I confront him? I am not sure about this option because i will give him too much importance. The second one is just disappearing and never answer his calls or texts again. Or as my friend suggested, she could set up that date on Tuesday and never go, so he feels like the asshole he is. I am not really the type of person that seeks revenge but rather cries her eyes out when her heart is broken. I am super sensitive and emotional person but this dude really effed this up!

44,ne24l6,1621211301,What's wrong with me?,"So last week, I have met a guy in a very spontaneous way. I met him through a dating app - Hinge to be specific. We chatted for few days/weeks. We kept on planning to meet but there's something that always came up. In the end, he decided to picked me up from my place right on the spot so we can finally meet.

I felt that we had a vibe. He's a gentleman tho that made me attracted. But I am well aware that he's not looking for a serious relationship due to his business and last toxic relationship. So, we vibe, we talked, we laughed and everything is going smoothly. And yes, after that night, we had sex. After that, we watched a movie and he booked a Grab for me to get home.

During our talk, he mentioned that unlike the other girls, they want to have an emotional attachment first before sex. And that really hits me hard. Dunno if its a compliment or amazement, idk. I was like, ""oh yes, I am not this kind of woman"". Its just that, for me, we had the vibe together that made me feel attracted and comfortable with him.

So fast forward, consistenly for 3 days after that night, he kept on messaging. Recently, I guess he is busy so I just tried to send a message once to check on him but I saw that he keeps on staying online but he's not opening/reading my message nor replying. I felt that he is intentionally ghosting me.

I was kinda hurt, a bit. Maybe felt insulted or what. And I guess there's something wrong with me. Maybe I gave my body too fast that made him off or something. I really don't know. I think there's something wrong with me 'cause I give sex too fast that makes guys less interested.

That‚Äôs like the universe of my nightmares. Not sure why that idea disturbs me so much.

But I guess it‚Äôs not true. Maybe group 1 is just special and gets *more* respect than everyone else. People in group 2 may get some respect but they just will never be respected like the people in group 1.

Basically the idea that women decide how valuable and worthy a man is by whether they want to fuck him or not. And everything else is an act. That is an idea that makes me really uncomfortable.

68,ne42d0,1621217414,Just venting...,"I remember all my past crushes and I realized my feelings for them were simply based around lust, infatuation, and enamorment.i would deify them because they would fill me with a sense of validation that I never got from my mother. I would mistake this for love when it wasn't.

I met a guy on Hinge last August. We became fast friends and it didn't take long for him to unlock the initial feelings of attraction and deification. 

But he is a recovering alcoholic and is not ready for a serious  commitment right now. I asked him if he could see us possibly being together when he becomes more comfortable with the idea of dating. He told me that he is not sure and doesn't want to make promises like that. Now, I may be naive but even I know that that's code for ""not interested."" I hold no I'll will against him. After all, it is not his fault for not loving me in a romantic light and he does not not owe a romantic relationship. So, I left it at that and never mentioned my feelings for him again. And besides, my heartache is not his responsibility.

We then continued on as friends and acted like nothing even happened. I thought the feelings would pass eventually but nope. They have only gotten stronger as I got to know him better. I no longer see him as an 'angel' or 'the ideal man''. I see him for him. I see him as an introverted, conservative, and blunt man who loves creating things and is extremely passionate about music. I see a man who has been through a lot of shit but is slowly taking the steps needed to better himself even though it is a struggle for him. I see, a man who has such deep self-loathing that he doesn't even like celebrating his own birthday. And that's unfortunate really because to me, there's nobody better than him both on the inside AND outside. It makes me want to do what I can to comfort him and it makes me feel more protective of him. 

The fact that I am starting to see him as an actual  person.... makes it even harder for me to move on and it makes the situation more painful for me. I would take a bullet for this man, give him the world, and he's pretty much all I think about. And what's worse....I think I'll him love until the day I die (25F) and I don't think I'll be able to love anybody as much I love him. I don't think I'll find anybody who i feel as comfortable with or find a

.nybody who makes me feel as happy as I do when we hang out alone together or talk on the phone. But I know this closeness is going to end one day because he will eventually fall in love with someone else and she will be a bigger priority than me. Knowing that that day will eventually happen, is literally making me cry at the mere mention of it.

I also ask myself every day why I am not good enough for him....because I honestly think we would be the best couple if he did love me back. But unfortunately, that is not the reality I am living in.

Bit of a ramble, btw.

So, basically, I started working a new job about a month ago. A few weeks in I started casually talking with this cute girl at break one day, didn‚Äôt really think much of it. A few days later, one of my coworkers adds me to a group Snapchat and the girl I talked to friended me a few hours later from there. 

I decided to start snapping her directly (cause she is hella cute) and we talked back and forth a bit each day, nothing crazy, just small talk to pass the time. After about 4 days, she sends me a goodnight snap at 10:30PM in her PJs. This was really out of the blue, so I kind of thought it was accidental. I gave a pretty barebones response and heard nothing back. 

The next day, I send her a snap in the morning, like I normally do, and she opens it and doesn‚Äôt respond. We talked for a few minutes in the middle of the day and then I snapped her one more time before work ended, and again, she didn‚Äôt respond.

The next morning, I snapped her one more time and decided that if she doesn‚Äôt respond I‚Äôll just stop talking since she‚Äôs probably not interested. I don‚Äôt hear anything back all day, so I just plan on not talking to her over Snapchat anymore.

Then at about 7:30PM she sends me a snap that‚Äôs a selfie of her and there‚Äôs a filter that says ‚Äúshoot your shot.‚Äù I‚Äôm kind of stunned but I can‚Äôt really reply as I was swamped with work and didn‚Äôt get any free time until 3 hours later when my shift ended. I messaged her when I got off and just said that I finally got out of work and asked what‚Äôs up?

She didn‚Äôt open it that night (which was last night) but she opened it at 7:00 this morning and I haven‚Äôt heard anything since.

First of all, I am introverted... which is definitely one of the reasons why I‚Äôm never compatible with anybody really; I sometimes feel uncomfortable with people, but not to the point where people think i‚Äôm mute. I used to be like that, but i‚Äôve come a long way to step out of my comfort zone and communicate with people.

I experience guys just liking me for my body my whole life; I don‚Äôt even know who to trust anymore. Guys never seem to want me for me, all they want is to have sex.

Pass the time pleasantly until she leaves. I don't mean sex, assume its a first time date and you don't know each other that well and you don't feel like talking. Something pleasant for her but doesn't involve much talking between you two 

Let's say from the circumstance that telling her ""let's go out now for a walk now/I'm busy/Oh I gotta do X/let's head out now"" might be too obvious that you are trying to kick her out or she doesn't want to go outside b/c of the weather. Say you do want to see her again

Is this abnormal or bad that I think these selfless thoughts about him? I‚Äôve never had that happen with a guy before. 

Sex and stuff like that just isn‚Äôt the first thing on my mind.

92,ne5y7a,1621223393,Mixed Signals,"I thought I had it going with this guy, we have some great conversations and it is clear that we like each other. He is usually the one who goes out of his way to talk to me, and he always asks me questions to get to know me better.

However, over text, he always leaves me on delivered although he is always active on social media, and seems pretty distant when he texts.

What could this mean?

I'm planning to be direct and address what he is doing the next time I meet him in person, but I'm having a bit of trouble reading the situation here. I know that I can be a bit oblivious at times, so I may be missing something here.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ne5y7a/mixed_signals/
93,ne5y8w,1621223397,"God, I hate casual dating so much","I haven't really casually dated in 6 years, but I met somebody about 9 months ago. We were friends at first then FWBs, and then started casually dating. I told her that I wanted to be exclusive, but she said she wasn't ready for it because she had just gotten out of a long engagement. 

&amp;#x200B;

So we start casually dating, and then she meets somebody and they start dating. He fades away, and then she meets another dude, and they start dating. She says to just be patient, and trust the process. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm super annoyed at this, but I'm just going to play it cool. I feel like I'm just being strung along though, and that what if this new guy fades away, and she meets a different guy and they start dating, and then they brake up, and she never decides to make us exclusive?

&amp;#x200B;

Then what really makes me upset is that I watched her kid the other day so she could rest because she was feeling sick. I walk in on her talking on the phone to this other guy she is dating. So I feel like I'm being taken advantage of, and that she should have been resting.

&amp;#x200B;

So, Reddit, is dating always this exhausting? Should I bring up the fact that she was talking to another guy that she is dating while I was watching her kid while she was supposed to be resting?

95,ne6hni,1621225168,Continue or end things early? Red flags...,"I have been dating someone for a few weeks now. She has a lot of great qualities, but there are some red flags that give me pause.

 1. She is less educated than me and is in a lower paying job that doesn‚Äôt allow for any vertical movement. She isn‚Äôt career-driven. I am highly educated and have high income potential. She jokingly made a comment about staying home and watching our future children, and even as a joke, it bothered me. Having a partner who is career-driven and can provide similarly is important to me. I don‚Äôt want to be a breadwinner.

2. She might have a problem with alcohol. I‚Äôve noticed that our first few dates revolved around lots of alcohol, which isn‚Äôt usually the case for me‚Äî not a big drinker or partyer. She usually drinks more than me. And she recently got trashed at a party and drunk-dialed me, which made me uncomfortable. I did some light internet stalking and found her Twitter, and every other tweet was about getting drunk or partying. 

The dilemma: 
She‚Äôs kind, thoughtful, attentive, and affectionate; she makes me feel special. The physical chemistry is great too. It‚Äôs nice to share intimacy. Dating is hard, and I‚Äôve finally found someone I enjoy being around. HOWEVER, there are red flags. And I‚Äôm not looking for anything long term (I‚Äôve told her this), but she is already hinting about exclusivity and the future. Because I like her and because she‚Äôs so great otherwise, I question if I‚Äôm overthinking these ‚Äúred flags.‚Äù But then I realize I don‚Äôt want to end up with her in the long term because of those concerns.

So, do I break things off now? Or can I re-communicate my preference for something that isn‚Äôt long-term and continue to date if she‚Äôs okay with that? I don‚Äôt want to hurt her. 

Please help. I‚Äôm confused.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ne6hni/continue_or_end_things_early_red_flags/
