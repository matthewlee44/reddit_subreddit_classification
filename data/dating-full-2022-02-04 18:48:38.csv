So I (18M) met this girl (18F) through a friend around 3 weeks ago, we’ve been FaceTiming a lot, talking loads and we have got on really well. Generally, it has been great and she’s really exciting me. We’re meeting tomorrow (first time ever) and I feel guilty.

I have been single for a long time and over that time I have done ‘stuff’ with a few girls I have known. Today with someone I used to be involved with we sexted and I feel guilty about it. I don’t have any romantic feelings for them anymore but it happened. I know I haven’t met her yet and we aren’t exclusive but I feel guilty for it. 

Additionally (yeah there’s more) a couple weeks ago I met up with one of my exes (from a long time ago, no romantic feelings for her at all) and I kissed her. We used to be FWBs for a time but we had few romantic elements to it, just a lot of care for eachother. 

I don’t know I am right for feeling guilty about this, I haven’t even met her yet but I can’t feel but think what I have done is wrong. Should I tell her? Maybe not immediately but at some point in the future? Am I in the wrong or am I overreacting?

so his response was ""lol"" and he asked me what I told my friend Jeremy. jeremy is a male friend who was also at the get together.

I, (Male 29), had a one night stand with another person (Male 26) whom works in the same office as me. But we're in different teams so we don't actually work with each other, we're just in the same building so we bump into each other frequently at work.

Long story short, drinks night out with the firm led to me having a one night stand with the person. But I was very drunk and was probably extremely embarrassing and probably couldn't even perform because I was so drunk. I barely remember it happening until I woke up.

Next morning, unlike other one night stands I've had, I actually really like the guy. I think he likes me too. Despite the awkward sex/night, I ask him face to face on a date, but he says he's going on a road trip with a few of his cousins this weekend so can't. I understand and I knew he had this planned because work confirmed it as he had some holiday planned.

When he's back in the office from his trip, it's not as awkward as I thought it would be. I still have feelings for the guy and I am keen to rearrange the date. He wasn't in the office on Friday because he had a day off, and so I decide to call him that evening and see if would fancy coming out to a bar for some drinks this weekend.

But when I ask him a second time, he explains that he's flying to Spain for a few days because it's his birthday on the Saturday and he had this booked before. (also true because he told me his birthday was on Saturday and also because work confirmed it)

Surprise surprise.

I don't doubt his excuses not to go on a date with me, because they are definitely genuine and I think every time i've asked it's been an awkward time to ask, but I really want to see him again on a casual date when I am not fully intoxicated on a night out like I was when we first hooked up.

It's pretty demoralising getting shot down twice, but should I ask him a third time if he want's to go on a date with me? Or just let nature take its toll and see if he's willing to ask me out himself, since recently he's been unable to make time for it?

Any advice is much appreciated! I've been struggling with depression/social and general anxiety/low self worth/body image issues for at least 12 years. I was in therapy, which helped a lot, and plan on going back into therapy. I'm healing my low self worth, processing my trauma, all that good stuff, but it's a slow process. I'm going to be doing this for years. 

My question is: how do I deal with the urge to be close to someone and have a relationship, gain experience when I'm not necessarily ready to date? I don't really know what it means to be ""ready"" to date, honestly. I feel like I have this mentality that I need to be 100% to be with anybody in any way, which is bullshit. But separately, I'm also not in the situation to date. I still live at home with my family and I have a part time job and I'm slowly saving up money, but haven't created a plan yet for what to do in the future (still mulling over career paths). I can't feasibly see dating while I live at home... but if it's going to take me a while to move out, what do I do? Wait until I'm out to even try dating? That doesn't sound like a good idea either. 

I posted once on this sub that I didn't date because of social anxiety and depression. I got so many mixed responses. Half of the people were saying that I should wait and work on myself. The other half said that no matter what, I'd never be ready, so I should just jump into it. 

I really have no dating experience. I struggle A LOT meeting new people and getting close to people. It's not just the social anxiety, my low self worth interferes a lot. I don't see myself the way other people do, I can't imagine people enjoying spending time with me or finding me sexually attractive. I always feel awkward and it impacts the way I act with people. I struggle sometimes to spend time with my friends, even. So this is a reason to not date... but it won't get better unless I expose myself to meeting new people! Does that mean I need to focus on making friends only? I struggle to even muster the motivation to do that. 

I think the issue is partially that I don't know exactly why I want a partner so badly.

*  Is it a normal longing because I'm lonely? 
* Or do I need someone else to validate the fact that I'm desirable? 
* Am I just unhappy being alone, so I need to work on that first? 
* Am I just horny (I have a decently high libido, which is very annoying)? Do I just want a FWB? 
* Is this angst because I feel like I'm falling behind? This one bothers me more that I'd like to admit. It's painful to see that all of my friends, all of which also have chronic and fairly serious mental health problems, are much more socially adept than me. They date, they have sex, they have had relationships. Even if they weren't happy, they understand now what they want. I feel like a child knowing I have no experience dating at all. They've even pointed out to me that I don't seem take risks that other people seem to take effortlessly. 
* Or... do I just want to adrenaline rush of a ""crush""? 

I just don't know what to do. It really hurts to feel like I'm struggling so much just with the idea of meeting new people and being vulnerable in that way when... people seem to do it so effortlessly! How did my friends do it when they're all struggling too??? Granted, they don't have social anxiety. I'm just terrified of being like the women in my family. None of them seem to date at all for some reason and my mom's first and only relationship was my dad at age 28 (and they were miserable). I feel like every year I wait is another year gone.

I have been seriously talking to this guy for almost 2 months now. We have known each other and been sorta friends for two years, but about 2 months ago we slept together and have been non stop talking ever since. It is sorta long distance but we have spent weekends together and they have been perfect. We work so well together. Similar work ethic, communication and interests. Great sex.

We text almost all day long and we make phone calls for hours, too. He is great. He has expressed how I am amazing to him and he loves hearing from me every day and the time in person together is just a dream. We have had serious conversations and cried to each other and been vunerable.

Problem is, he is scared to jump into another relationship. We are exclusively seeing each other, but without the label. He told me he wants time to figure out his emotions and better himself. His ex left him abruptly and it really hurt him. He's confused about his feelings because this isn't exciting like his previous loves, but its safe and not toxic. I think he is just scared to let his feelings in and is terrified of being hurt.

Anyways. He told me he wants to wait before fully committing. He told me about a month or so. But this give me extreme anxiety and trust issues and I pick fights often and need reassurance, which he is always so patient about.

I’m looking for advice because I am kinda torn on what to do and when I asked my friends they all were pretty much 50/50 on their answer.

I had a short fling with a girl who got out of a LTR with an ex pretty recently before we started seeing each other (2 months post breakup). We had a pretty good time together but it only lasted 2 months before she decided to get back with her ex. We immediately stopped talking after that. At the time I was really into her. I do think about the what-if with her from time to time and have not found a solid connection since. 

It’s been 5 months since then and I’ve gone on dates with a couple people but nothing has really stuck. Two weeks ago I got a text from her just saying “Hey how’ve you been”. I ignored it and just went about my day. About a week later she texted again saying “I’m around your neighborhood tomorrow did you want to grab lunch?”. Again I ignored it (at this point I’m pretty tempted to respond). Last night she sends another text “I know you probably don’t want to talk to me but I’d really like to see you one more time. Maybe I could come drop your stuff of this weekend?” 

The persistence is kind of throwing me off. In the back of my head I know if she was really into me to begin with she wouldn’t have called it off but I also know she wasn’t 100% emotionally available when we met. I wonder if I should give her more of a chance granted we didn’t date for a crazy amount of time and just see what she has to say.

I have had difficulty meeting people in the ""real world"" because I don't really like bars and I like intelligent young people. I kind of feel like I missed the boat and there is nothing I can do about it. Sometimes I will just go with the flow towards who I naturally feel attracted to and she is like 20-22 and I can't really talk about my age otherwise she will just leave. I don't like the expectation that I have had to choose between independence and being super serious adult that isn't allowed to have fun or explore at all

I am fit and healthy and I would say reasonably attractive and have a good job but now that I'm independent I'm isolated

Ever since my first long term relationship of five years ended back in 2019 I've been on annever-ending quest to find someone new . I'm not the type of guy who likes to fool around and not committ, I date long term and want something serious out of the people I meet. As a person I tend to be sensitive and therefore not really into wear and tear relationships like FWBs and what not. I find it very emotionally taxing to get to know someone, become intimate and then never see them again. 

I've now been on multiple dates with multiple people and it never works out, for a variety of reasons. I see my dates anywhere from a couple weeks to even months. Then it abruptly ends. Some suddenly say they don't want anything serious, some say they didn't ""connect"" or ""click"" with me, some just ghost. Now, I know I'm not entitled to anything and that's not my point. They, of course, have the absolute right to not date me and I respect that. My problem is that nothing ever seems to pan out no matter what strategy I use: I try to better myself, be open and encouraging, listen and be empathetic, not rush, not be aloof, the list goes on. But it never just works. 

Now I've come into this stage where I just think ""I can't do this another time, it's killing me"" whenever I think of meeting someone new. I just dread the thought of investing myself again only to be ""dumped"" or ghosted by someone that I had hopes for or had an emotional connection to. Now I just stare blankly at my list of tinder matches and wonder how I'm even going to muster the energy to formulate an intitial greeting or ice breaker. 

I know I should probably take a break from online dating. But I just sense that this problem won't go away even if I take a break from all of this. I just don't know how I'm going to find the energy to do this. Is this just what online dating is?

We established quite close relationship by sharing our personal craps. By that I meant favorites, childhood traumas, other wholesome stuff. We talked about our exes and what we learned about ourselves from that. We clarified at the start that we both doesn't want relationship atm. I am just healing from my previous relationship and he is not the person who can commit. We did movie nights together but I think that would only count as a hangout. Fast forward, November we both become busy, and what's great is we both understand and respected we also have our own lives to work on. The chats become less and less but when we do, we're as intimate as the first time we matched, sending pictures about something awesome on that day. 

Around last week November, he blurted a strange question out of nowhere. He asked me WHAT AM I GONNA DO IF SOMEONE ASKED ME OUT BUT IM NOT READY BUT IM AFRAID THAT IF I LET THEM WAIT, THEY'D BE GONE. I was taken aback. It might be he was asking for someone, or, he's actually subtly testing what I'll do possibly. I stood firmly with my belief that I shouldn't date as I still need to heal, (even tho I already liked him so much) so I told him I would let that person go. I added it depends, because if you're lucky, that person might actually put up with your shit and it might work out. He didn't reply to me after I answered that, until the next day. He told me he asked because someone asked him out. I was so embarassed for overthinking, but at the back of my mind, I thought maybe he's just making up a story since my reply was a ""No""? But I shrugged that thought. The chat became lesser compared to how less it orignally was. Our plans for movie nights and play times didn't happen by December. There were times when I thought maybe he doesn't wanna talk anymore since there were messages without replies from him. But eveytime I decide to like move on, it's just another online cliché crap, he sent me a message. I can't read him at all. Again, when we talk, it would always feel like the first time we connected, or at least to me. 

We greeted each other on holidays but after that, nothing. I don't wanna seem clingy but I can't contain the silence, I tried to contacthim last mid January, no reply. I thought maybe that's it. I started to focus on things, life goes on. However he messaged me again the other day. He talked about how he spent time with a girl friend these past weeks (he really mentioned his friend was a girl, weird af), and he was busy af. I replied gracefully, so he won't think I was affected by him not replying these past weeks.  Then, he asked me if it's okay to ask a girl out and tell her he doesn't want a relationship out of it. These are my thoughts: 1. Why would he contact me just to ask this, don't he have other friends more expert to ask about? 2. He was talking about the girl who he said asked him out last November, but there were inconsistency on the details. 

I'm so confused, the way he described their relationship (the girl who asked him out), was so same with ours, except they've known each other for 5 yrs. What do you think? I don't hate him or anything, I'm just purely confused. Additional point which made me overthink was that I followed his playlist on spotify and I've seen he's listening to music about pushing a lover away, sad breakup and other songs which contain familiar situation and relatable stuff.

When a man suddenly gets cold, everyone tells you, “move on, he’s talking to someone else.” That’s the rule right? He claims he’s been busy with work, life stuff (family) and was just in a bad place and now that he’s feeling better and I’m not really taking him seriously, he’s frustrated and his feelings are hurt. (Also his birthday this weekend). 
—- He told me this at the time he was ignoring me and I respected it, but after a few weeks of NC, what am I supposed to do?

This is happening with another guy I’ve connected with since then. This guy was moving way too fast but I didn’t mind it. Then when he seemed distant, I asked if he wanted to slow things down between us and he seemed confused, wondered why I thought something was wrong. So I stopped stressing it. Like a week later, he’s distant again and I was frustrated.  Then I apologized and asked if he was mad because I got upset and he said he wasn’t mad, he’s just been spacing himself out. — I know he’s stressed about his future and finding a job, career, (he’s leaving military) but everyone says it’s no excuse to go cold on someone. — since then, no initiation on his end, but he did start responding to my texts immediately. I’ve since stopped for good 2 weeks ago and am letting go.

My question is…what do I do? I keep asking for advice, when men go cold, it means he’s not interested. For me personally, I go cold when I’m overwhelmed. I only lose interest in men after they do something disrespectful. I’m tired of getting it wrong with men and here I’ve insulted someone who claims he’s not seeing anyone and was just stressed and shut down.

Posting here since I’m not really sure where else to seek guidance… don’t want to ask my friends (kinda embarrassing) and don’t want to ask my family (they think I’m a 10/10 stud that any girl would be lucky to have). 

I’m a straight guy, 27, over six feet tall, college educated, with a decent job, a full head of hair, and am in decent physical shape (I’m not jacked but I exercise regularly). 

I thought those qualifications would make me somewhat attractive. But I struggle on dating apps. I just don’t get that many likes. Barely any matches. Nobody flirts with me in real life either. 

I’m told height is such an important factor, but I’m ok in that regard. I also read that it’s hard to find well-educated men, but I’m ok in that aspect too. I’m not fat, either. 

Basically the inescapable conclusion is that I have an ugly face, right? What else could it be? I’m also not Caucasian, maybe that’s what’s hurting me? Do white girls not like non-white guys? Most of the girls on the apps are white. 

So I guess I’m reaching out to my fellow ugly guys on Reddit that have managed to find some form of happiness in relationships, and am asking you, how did you do it? How did you cope with being ugly and make yourself desirable? Are you rich? Did you go crazy hard at the gym to make up for it?

So I’m a 23 year old male, and I’m currently in like with a girl that’s in one of my classes in university. I haven’t had a girlfriend in a very long time, but I have been on dates with two girls but they just came naturally and I didn’t have to put much effort into them. Now, since I have to actively pursue this girl that Id like to have a chance with… i want some advice on how to proceed.

We had two classes together so far and only see each other on Mondays. The first Monday we didn’t talk at all and just left class once it ended. The second time around, I asked if I could walk with her to her next class and she said yes. I walked her to her next class which probably took around 5-8 minutes which is a super short time, but I feel like she was interested in me because when I said bye she seemed happy to have talked to me. (Cringe note: I offered her a fist bump when saying bye HAHAH) 

The main thin I am questioning is… should I walk her to her next class again this next Monday? I don’t want to come off as too forward or desperate or creepy. OR should I wait until the next Monday to walk with her to her next class. Furthermore, when should I ask her on a date to grab a coffee?

For some backstory, ever since I was a little kid, Asian culture has absolutely fascinated me, ever since I played some of my first video games in Japanese, I wanted to know more, driven to experience new things. In middle school I tried teaching myself Japanese, but life got in the way and I had to drop it. In college I began self-taught Korean, made a few friends who since lost contact with, but felt like I found something I could really get into. In the process, I learned more about the history, culture, and lifestyle of the country, and found myself getting more and more physically attracted to the women in the process, and not just because of kpop or kdramas, I mean the real, normal, everyday people.

Which is where this long-winded question comes into play: I've been trying to get into a romantic relationship for years and have a heavy preference for Korean women - not something that's even conscious anymore, they're just my ""type"", and don't treat them any different than anyone else - but any time I try to express that, I'm insulted, degraded, called racist slurs and names, and banned from multiple dating apps for reasons I still don't even understand.

I have nothing but their best interests in mind and want a mostly wholesome relationship, but after years of literal gatekeeping from nearly every single community or app I've ever tried, I'm still nowhere closer to understanding why people hate me so much for this, when other people seem to do the same scot-free.

We texted every day for over a month- he was very kind and we had some good conversations. I was really excited to talk to him because we had mutual interests and personality traits. 


As we texted, he said a lot of love-bombing things to me like he wants to marry me, that he talked to his mom about me and told her he wants to date me, etc. but I never took those comments very seriously even though I was flattered.

Anyways, I told him from the start that I wasn't aiming for anything but a serious relationship, to which he said he was looking for the same thing. An important side note is that a month or so before joining Tinder, I had just gotten out of a relationship with a guy who was verbally and psychologically abusive to me (called me names, lied to me, gaslit me, etc). So going from an abusive ex like that to texting a kind guy who seemed to genuinely care about me was a stark contrast and I wasn't too sure how to navigate it without sabotaging things.


I expressed my interest in actually meeting up with this Tinder guy... But he never asked me out. At first, the excuses seemed genuine (wintery road conditions, Covid, etc) then as more time went on, I was growing more and more worried. Every time I texted him something like ""I'd love to do __ and __ with you."" He would say something like ""We will. Eventually"" like it was going to happen sometime but he never actually took any action to plan anything and meet up... I brought it up to him and he said that he honestly just didn't know what to do if we went on a date cause of Covid, and because I live 45 minutes away from him and he doesn't have a great car, that he wouldn't feel comfortable driving this far. I'm just like ok....  But my red flag sensors were going off so I literally just ended up telling him I wasn't interested in texting him anymore because I was getting my hopes up and getting attached to these ""promises"", and I didn't want to text someone for such a long time without meeting. I'd rather be completely single or date someone who is also looking to meet up in person and wants the same things I want. 


I think he just wanted some attention for a while. And I'm probably not even in the best emotional state to be romantic with anyone after my previous relationship. But this other side of me is sad and wondering if I ruined something that could have been good if I had just given him more time or said something different? I don't know. I miss him. I'm just not trying to play with his feelings- or my own.

So long/short of the situation is: I (38F) met a guy (38M) online, we linked for a consensual romp (after chatting for a month, ironing out basic logistics and exchanging pictures etc.) Again, consensual after establishing a mutual attraction. It went well enough and we kept in touch here and there for the next several months. Usually me sending a quick note about a shared interest (sports, politics, COVID, the world ending, happy insert whatever holiday) and he always replied back. Keep in mind we chatted about all the things before meeting. Sometimes he replied with a conversation and we would chat for a bit. This could be three times per week or three times per month. Very normal, wholesome, and casual. Recently while chatting for an unusual extended period of time, we exchanged numbers to talk by phone at HIS request. I thought nothing of it, except - sure that’s easier than this back + forth messaging. We chatted forever (most of the night), and again the next, and again the next, maybe taking a night or two off, rinse wash repeat. Somehow we had a break in schedules and ironed out logistics to meet again! Obviously in a somewhat different ‘space’ than last time - since we know each other a lot more now. At no point was I thinking we would end up *together* for several reasons; top reason —being the long distance. That’s just a non-starter for career folks in their late 30s and especially since we met 12 months ago and have or will have seen each other ONLY twice (first time for say 2-3 hours and second time for 8 days). Cut to the chase: we linked. It was fun, beautiful, magical, low-key, chill, all the things you would do - for a week. One big extended ‘date’ as if we were truly together (but we were not). NOW, he’s gone cold. I dare say: ghosted me! We live far apart and I honestly just want my ‘pen pal’ late-night bestie, occasional text-buddy, meme- sending, recipe-sharing, article/tweet, random selfie-sending friend back. If possible —how about at 50% where we were a few weeks ago. Because I need more rest at night and with a crazy client/case load during the day…. which seems reasonable (to me). Just here for the constructive assessment. Be kind, but be honest. For the record, every man that has been a D€cK in the past has circled back to apologize at some point. If not all, most. So why not just be kind, honest, and communicative now? If it’s too much or if I’m too much, just say it. If it’s the timing- say it.

I(30m) just started talking with a person(31f). We matched on tinder. She seems really awesome. While we were talking she tells me that she had a mental breakdown that ended up putting her in the hospital. She adds that while in the hospital, her fiancé left her. I felt awful for her. We talked about it for a bit. 

During that conversation, to me at least, she made it seem like this happened last year and that she was over it and ready to get back into dating. I asked her what she was looking for in a relationship. She told me and it was what I was looking for as well. 

I then asked her what she was looking for besides that. That’s when she told me, she wasn’t ready for a relationship because her fiancé only left about a month ago. She told me that she wants to date again just in case it works out but she also wants to hold out just in case the (Ex?) fiancé comes back into to the picture. That’s when I said I was willing to at least try to have a relationship with her. It’s been a little bit and she still hasn’t gotten back to me yet. I honestly don’t think she will either.

Hoping to get some advice. Long story short, I've been on a hiatus from dating and I'm trying to get back into the scene. I've never really used the apps before, but I figured I'd give them a go. And well, to my surprise, I got liked by someone who seems really cool! We messaged back and forth very briefly, just basic introductions and a couple of questions and whatnot. And well, I guess I was feeling pretty bold (the fact that I even got liked alone is already a win for me so anything else at this point is gravy lol), and I decided to ask for their number. Sure enough, she gave me her number! Holy shit!

So here's the thing - our messages were fairly infrequent - both she and I haven't been quick to respond to one another. I work full time, so at the least I know I wasn't quick on the responses. But when I messaged her earlier today (so she would have my number and also to say hello and whatnot), I didn't get a response at all in any way. I'm not reading into it too much since I'm sure she's busy as well, but it got me thinking - what *exactly* is the etiquette for these interactions now that we've exchanged numbers? Real talk, I worry about coming off as cringey and the last thing I want is to make anyone uncomfortable, so I'm perhaps thinking a bit too much about when, if and how I should message again. I don't want to be the dude who floods a lady with a bunch of messages and comes off as super annoying haha. 

Basically, what do you guys gals and non binary pals think? Again, I'm not reading too much into the actual *dating* aspect per se, I want to get to know this person more first before even thinking about meeting up or whatever (though it is on the horizon potentially now as we've exchanged numbers of course). But, any tips or advice about how to approach actually texting this person now without coming off as overbearing, and/or to avoid flooding them with texts inadvertantly would be much appreciated!",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1157246,public,self,"What is the etiquette, if any, for contacting someone after getting their number from a dating app?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/skwhc5/what_is_the_etiquette_if_any_for_contacting/,no_ads,0.0,,,

Last month, we went out to dinner and talked for 3 hrs on first meet up. We were in contact via Instagram messages. Then we talked on the phone to buy tickets &amp; see the Spider-Man movie. The day before movie I asked if he could stop sending those IG video reels politely, it was a bit overboard. On day of movie, he said good morning and I replied with a wave emoji. He normally would continue the conversation via Instagram but doesn’t message again until he said he was waiting at the theater. I was not as bubbly as I was on first meet up , I was very quiet (not against him). He was annoying me during the movie, he’s the type to laugh and make noises when something exciting came on. He nudged me during the movie and asked if I was ok because I was quiet and I said yes. At the end I told him thanks, he said you’re welcome and he said drive safe. When I spoke with him on phone day before movie, he told me that he talked about me with his friends but after movie he sent a message just now saying that he wasn’t really feeling it from me and it’s not going to work for him. I was more upset that he beat me to rejecting him, I would have done it if he didn’t. Flash fwd to last week, he sends me a dm with an inside joke, I just left him on read again.
