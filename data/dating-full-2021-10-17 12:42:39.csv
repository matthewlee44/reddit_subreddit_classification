It's alot slower than what I have seen previously and I'm starting to wonder if I'm just that match he speaks to on the side, while he goes out on other dates with matches he has a greater preference for. 

The lack of pace hasn't been terrible, in fact it's a little refreshing to be able to chat a bit before getting asked out for a drink. But in total, because it's only a message a day, it's not even been a large amount of talking.  I'm wondering if I've just ended up liking someone who just isn't that into me and maybe it's worth just leaving this and finding someone else to talk to?

I guess I need to accept that. It’s hard pill to swallow. 

Dating in your late 30s sucks. I thought I had found someone amazing, a great match. 

Our first date went really well - she kissed me at the end! - and she wanted to schedule another one soon, and also a quick one even before that. So we do, and we went to dinner, and again it was great.  I got a bigger kiss on her doorstep as I dropped her off, and even got invited in to meet her children. Later I got a text saying the food then I was nice and funny and that they liked me too. 

Two nights later she wanted to come over to my house, and ended up coming late night. I tried to get close but she seemed nervous and didn’t seem to return the feeling so I didn’t push it further. Made me wonder if she didn’t feel that way about me, but I was confused that she asked to come over late night and didn’t feel that way, so I was unsure of where things stood. 

The next day I texted and asked when I could see her again. She stated my schedule for the week (she remembered from a previous conversation) and said she’d look for stuff for us to do on Saturday. But nothing committal. So I was a little unsure if she chase a change of heart. 

We texted a few times the next few days. Mid week she texted late night, after neither of texted for 36 hours, and asked if we could text the next day. I was happy to hear from her, and glad to connect. I texted her the next day (Thursday, and after a brief exchange where I also said I was still excited to see her this weekend, (she replied with a thumbs up on my message -oof ) she said she was going to bed at 9pm (much earlier than usual) and wasn’t going to reply anymore. I get that. Seems weird not to confirm plans tho since Saturday was 48 hours away. 

No communication on Friday. And none on saturday. To be honest, I waited to see if she would text me to confirm plans we discussed earlier that week, but she didn’t. So I texted and she replied she spent the entire day out with her best friend from a block away. Oof. 

A younger me would continue to ask her out. But I’m now realizing she purposely didn’t prioritize going out with me on a proper third date. It was a rare opportunity our parenting schedules aligned and we could do so. I was excited to see her again. I don’t think the feeling is mutual 

So yeah, this sucks. Dating sucks at this age. You can find someone who’s amazing, beautiful, have good connection with, and even lives a block away. You can be told by that person they want to see where things go to. You can do really well on each date (you know what I mean, with great connection, flirting, and what not). You can have the other person send signals they are interested. And yet find out you’re not worth their time when they close to make other plans instead of see you again. 

This feeling sucks. I wonder what changed for her? I’ve dated a long time and I felt these dates were really good so I don’t see anything that would change a loss of interest. Especially after seeing me 3 times in one week after our first date. Then nothing. 

I guess I’ve realized I’m a clown if I outside things further when she’s made it clear she’s not prioritizing seeing me.

I have no game. That’s pretty much a given. I can’t reply make conversations or have them flow or keep them going. This goes for pretty much everyone I interact with. Convos start decent and then they just die off. Kind of like a car going up a hill, then midway it gets too tough and starts rolling backwards. Then nothing, just silence or one word answers. 

I’ve always kind of been like this. I’m a man of few words. I don’t tend to express my opinion in person, a lot of times I don’t have much of an opinion on anything. I’m branching out though and I’m trying to be more personable but to be fair I’m also the type of person that doesn’t really do exciting things. I do a lot of stuff by myself but I never really stories to tell. I’ve traveled and been to places but I could never express anything very vividly or vibrantly like some people. So it makes me think that maybe I’m boring or a boring conversationalist and that translates to not having game. 

Everything else in my life is pretty good. Good career, my own house, new car from 2019, dog and a cat. My only hobbies are the gym and maybe watching tv or a movie. Sometimes i don’t do anything for a whole week except cook, clean, take my dog to the park or on a hike and that’s it. 

I think looks wise I look fine. I’m in a meetup group and people seem to like me so I’m making some friends but I still suck at conversation. I always make sure I dress well, smell good etc. So I’m not worried about that. 

Im just worried that I suck at having game. Going to a bar and trying to approach a girl and having something to talk about. Keeping the convo going. I have approach anxiety but I have approached before and made small talk that went nowhere. 

I really would love to step my game up but idk what it is or what it looks like. What does a guy with game look like to women?

A bit of a backstory, I met this guy in 2018. We dated for 9 months and lived in an apartment together for 3 months after dating for 6 months. Bad decision I know. 
His mother really wanted us to rent an apartment and move in together. It appears he’s a man child and his parents took care of him before I started dating him. The man didn’t have his own debit card and he was 26 at the time. 

After living in the apartment for 3 months I dump him. I was still responsible for half the rent. After trying pay rent one month after moving out the apartment complex wanted him to vacate the premises and did not want any of our money. I found out he stabbed someone within the apartment complex. He’s in an active court case and may be going to prison.  

Recently he has decided to contact me. The first time was a month ago. After telling him I wanted to vomit at the thought he was talking to me, his current girlfriend decided to talk to me. She is aware he stabbed someone. Than I asked both of them to block me on Facebook and they did. 

Today or yesterday he unblocked me and sent me a message. He sent me 4 pictures of his cock. I did not view them. I do not want to see that. 

Umm what should I do? Just ignore it? Or sent a letter stating if he contacts me again I will pursue legal action? I do have a mailing address. 

He’s also an avid drug user.

Recently I moved to a city 5 hours away from him because of university but he didn’t want/could go with me because of his work and friend etc. We promised each other to see one another every two weeks on the weekend and he promised, he’d always wait for me and I totally believe him. By now everything works as planned but I always have those reoccurring thoughts that maybe I could be happier with someone who lives near me because I am someone who needs a lot of attention, touch, love, etc and it always hurts me when we are apart. Or maybe I’d be happier single because I wouldn’t have to deal with those emotions. Or i could miss out on something because I’d “waste” my “best” years  In addition since I moved away I sometimes have this weird feeling he’s texting other women, maybe even seeing them EVEN THOUGH i am 99% sure it’s not like that and he hasn’t ever done anything in the slightest in our relationship that would lead me to think such things (the only thing I know is that he likes, when he goes out -with me or with friends, doesn’t matter - is talking to other people, I think especially women and that in flirtatious ways, what’s totally alright with me, i like to do that too with both, same and opposite sex) I don’t know why but this distance thing just makes me believe has lowered my trust in him. I know all of this is just in my head, but how can I throw those doubts away?

The only thing that differentiates me from a cis man is that I tell myself I am a woman in my mind and only let very few close friends in on the secret, but even just that has been a source of great mental comfort for me.

As such, my question about when I should disclose trans status is a bit different from that of most people. Many trans women ostensibly present as female but have penises, and are wary of having to disclose it to their potential partners, whereas I am only trans in the privacy of my own mind, and have no anxiety about genital disclosure to women who initially see me as a man without having gotten to know me deeply.

When is a good time to disclose that I personally identify as a woman and ask my partner to understand me as such, while also keeping it a secret from others?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1074389,public,self,When is appropriate to disclose my trans status?

I have followed all the usual advice, I have quite a few pictures on my profile from a few angles and in different situations, I have a nice bio, and I always try to send nice messages and try to seem cool and approachable, but so far it has netted me 0 dates, now i do realize that I'm not very attractive in the traditional sense, but i take care of myself and I try to look as presentable as possible at all times, I think (hope) that I'm not an asshole or a bad person, and still after 2.5 years of trying 8 different apps/sites and spending hours and days of my life waiting for responses that I know are not coming I am ready to give up, but I thought to post here in hopes to get some good advice from all of you nice people.
And before you try to say that i should go out more and try to be more social and try to talk to people irl, I do that already, and i have gotten the same amount of success from that as a guy trying to climb everest without arms, legs, a brain and while angry and hungry hawks attack him, so any advice will be appreciated.
I should also mention that I'm from a country where online dating is not very prevalent, and is actually quite frowned upon, so that might be why my luck on dating sites/apps has been bad.

I haven't tried to flirt with a girl since I was 20 (I'm 22 now) because I've been too shy and insecure about my looks and personality, but I've recently been getting in shape and feeling a lot more confident.   
A week ago, I met this person on reddit who seemed really cool so I hit them up. I told her a bit about myself and if she wanted to chat over on discord, so we exchanged usernames and moved there. After an [awkward first message](https://imgur.com/a/qFipLAP), we hit it off and started talking about our shared interests  in literature, tv shows, views on life, what our ambitions were etc.  
[We talked, flirted](https://imgur.com/a/N9OTb0H) and shared pictures(not nudes) everyday until she one day [stopped responding after promising](https://imgur.com/a/RvlfGPF) that we would talk after I got home from a little event I was at. I didn't think anything of it, and simply thought that maybe she got busy with something. I went to bed and instead of saying ''goodnight'', sent [this](https://imgur.com/a/pHNpJnJ). I sent [one last message](https://imgur.com/a/83e6hoO) because this wasn't feeling like it was just her being busy now, and a few hours later she had blocked me.   


I'm still kind of processing all this which is why I made this post. Initially I was very hurt. I really liked this person, and in the 3 hour call friday, she had told me about an experience she had with ghosting, and how it hurt her. But now, I'm not angry, I'm not upset, I simply wish she would've just told me that she didn't feel like talking anymore.

I’m 23 years old, and never had anything close to a true relationship or physical intimacy. I feel like everything I do in life is just to keep me distracted from this. As long as I work, go out and get drunk and high with buddies from school, numb my mind with hours upon hours of movies and tv, scroll through social media, and just try not to think about it, I feel fine. But then I get tired, I have a day off, I find myself alone in my room again while I watch other people fall in and out of love around me, go out and experience shit together, I listen while people tell me about their stories of relationship drama or who they’re seeing or whatever, and it all feels so fucking alien to me. Like the possibility of my own life being like that is some fantasy I’ll never live.

I’m just not a lovable person. I’m likeable, but not lovable, and there’s a big difference between them. I’m at heart, a people pleaser. The best thing I could say about myself is that I’m funny. But I never stand up for my beliefs, or say anything that could potentially offend someone, or do anything for myself, or stand up for myself in any way, or let anyone into my life beyond surface level jokes. I don’t really know why. It all seems too scary. I hate being vulnerable with anyone and everyone, and because of that I feel like nobody’s ever gonna really know me and I’ll always be lonely, even if I’m surrounded by people who know me. And it’s not other people’s fault; I can be friendly and fun to be around, but I’m also aloof and distant and keep people at arms length. I don’t tend to message people first, even friends, and while part of me feels shame and loneliness from that, another part of me I feel would honestly be fine locking myself in my room away from the world completely where nobody can bother me. Every interaction with people almost feels like an exhausting chore because I’m never myself. 

But still, despite that, when I do get that much loved time alone to look back at my 23 years so far and realise I’ve never been emotionally or physically intimate with anyone, never been open with anyone in a human way that’s so natural for everyone else, never been attracted to someone who was attracted to me too, never known how to even begin to approach a relationship or even a true, intimate friendship, well it fucking hurts.

I’m sure there’s loads of things that could be reasons for this. Labels you could use. Maybe I have depression, or anxiety, hell I’m pretty sure I even have a mild bit of ADHD. But that doesn’t really matter; the main thing, for me, is I’m so fucking lonely and I have been as long as I can remember. I am never real with anyone, and I always just reflect back what people want me to be. And subconsciously, I’m sure people know this. It’s the most insecure thing in the world. And it’s impossible to love someone who isn’t even secure enough to trust in themselves and who they are.

I’m genuinely at the stage where like masturbation and stuff depresses me. Maybe too much information, but sometimes I’ll stop halfway through and think wow, I’m probably never gonna feel this with another person. Or even beyond sexual stuff, just the idea of laying in bed and watching tv with someone close to me, or waking up in a house where someone’s happy to see me, or having someone pursue plans with me because they enjoy me presence that much. These things just seem like complete impossibilities. I’ve seen time and again that I’m unlovable, that I can’t just naturally ‘get’ what others seem to about connecting with others. People like me, but I never know how to turn that mild fondness into something more. At best people probably see me the way they would a loved pet, but that’s not true connection.

Now I am not suggesting for him to stop seeing his parents but why wouldn't he split the time at least? I feel very frustrated, especially that I told him this yesterday and did hope he'd come see me today perhaps, just leave parents home early and come. But he didn't. Once again.

In these three months I have spent time with him during the day maybe twice. We always meet up just for couple hours, never spent together over a day and that starts to annoy me that he doesn't step up. I voiced it few times, I don't quite know what to do to be seen or heard.

I am an Indian (24M) and I'm at a point in life where I would like to explore FwB instead of the usual relationship.

The reason: I believe that FwB isn't as loaded with cultural expectations as the traditional monogamous relationship is. India is over-saturated with romance movies which have built up unrealistic expectations of a ""true"" lover/beloved. Even without these movies, I feel that the word ""relationship"" comes with some or the other set of expectations/assumptions that (in my experience) can be a little annoying at best or extremely damaging at worst. I have felt inadequate in relationships when I knew that I couldn't measure up to a particular popular notion, and I have also felt that my expectations (even if unintentionally) might have hurt one of my girlfriends emotionally. So, been on both sides of this and that's why I'm looking for something more flexible in the form of FwB.

I feel (to some degree) that FwB can be a good avenue to explore because it isn't loaded with as many expectations. I don't think FwB is a perfect replacment for relationships, there will be ups and downs there as well. But, just the idea of ""a friend with whom you can safely explore sex"" seems much more welcoming to me than the traditional relationship.

There seems to be some flexibility/acceptance in friendships, and that kinda acceptance/flexibility  I just don't see in relationships/dating that much.

This being said, I really want to ask you all how should I approach this topic. I know a few people who I kinda like but wouldn't want to date, but an FwB sounds really nice. A lot of us are touch-deprived and very lonely in India. A lot (if not all) of us Indians grow up with no (or very little) sex throughout their late teens/early-mid 20s because of the (practically conservative) socio-cultural atmosphere in India.

While westerners are losing their virginity around 16-24 (I guess?), most indians don't lose their virginity well into their late 20s - early30s. Most Indians therefore ultimately marry to have sex, but know very little about what they like and what their partner might like. Result: loveless marriages with disappointing/non-existent/abusive sex lives.

This is another reason why I think FwBs are better. Because even if you don't find ""the one"", you can atleast have a trustworthy friend with whom you can start having sex, explore your and their sexual preferences, and have a much better idea of what you're actually looking for and what your partner(s) might like. A much more intimate understanding of how to ask for consent, how to talk about (and do) foreplay and sex positions etc. - all of this is just is not a part of most Indians' lives throughout their mid/late 20s. Getting to go through this phase with an FwB instead, I feel, can help a lot.

Now, zooming onto my problem:

The issue is that I don't know how to bring up the idea of FwB without sounding like a creep. I am like a medium-ugly/medium-good-looking/""average"" Indian guy, appearance-wise (so you can make an estimate of my confidence, or lack thereof).

I have had 2 girlfriends so far and I had a lot of fun with both of them! So I guess I am doing something right? But in both of these relationships (as I mentioned above) the ""weight"" of expectations kinda ended things. (I know a lot of westerners might be judging me real hard right now for only having 2 girlfriends till the age of 24, but 2 partners is a good number given the dating realities of India. Our country doesn't have prom nights and open dating cultures like USA/Europe)

Anyway, long story short: needed some advice on how to talk to people about FwB in a way the is genuinely welcoming, kind and doesn't seem like I'm a creep/fuckboy just trying to ""hit that"".

Anyways, with that as an introduction. I wanted to go to the point of my question. So, since I can remember I have only found attractive blonde/redhead women with blue eyes. I always lied to everyone saying that I never had a type because people would always call me either racist or get mad at me or tell me to be more realistic or tell me that I should stop being a self-race hater and date my own kind (whatever that means since I am mixed race).   


Even with all the negative feedback about my type, I managed to get a Finnish girlfriend in my teens that was 100% my type. We had tons in common, she was super smart (the top of her class). We would talk about tons of different topics, ranging from politics, to philosophy, to human rights, to anime, to cartoons, to foreign affairs, etc. She was a hopeless romantic like me and we would do tons of romantic things for each other. I loved her with all my heart. I have honestly never loved someone that much in my life. Sadly, things didn't work out between us (which up to this day I regret).   


In college, this one Danish girl that was my type physically was really into me, and she was super cute, but then she would never want to engage in conversation with me. She just wanted to party and invited me to parties, and then threw herself to make out with me when she was drunk. I pushed her away because I was looking for something long-lasting and not for a random hook-up with a drunk girl. Needless to say, we never spoke after that.  


I met this one girl online who was also my type physically, and she was super smart and logical kind of similar to my first gf.  She was so left-brained logical that I would call her ""my sexy robot"" because she was as logical as a robot. We talked non-stop for 3 months and then one day she just vanished like she never existed.   


Nowadays, I am 27, I live in an apartment complex full of cute blonde girls, but the issue is that all of them look at me like if I was a rapist every time that I try to say hi or talk to them. I swear that I am as cordial and nice as possible. I have no clue why they look at me like that. They look at me like if I don't deserve a second of their time.  


I started to think that maybe I just have more luck with Europeans. Because one time I just stupidly went to this cute Polish girl in Costco and said that cheesiest pick-up line ever, and she just laughed and was super friendly afterward. Back then I didn't have a phone so I couldn't get her number, but I am pretty sure that if I had it would have gone further.  


Either way, now that I am older it has gotten harder to meet the kind of girls that I am attracted to, mostly because I live in a city far away from all my friends and family. As I mentioned previously, there are tons of pretty girls at my apartment complex, but they don't give me the time of the day.   


I have complained previously here that no girls liked me and it is hard for me to find someone interested. And that is partially true, but not 100% true. I had women liked me in the past in online dating and real life, and they were nice people and kind of cute, but they were just not my type. I tried so hard to like them and want to be with them, but I just couldn't like them. I have rejected more girls than I can remember because of this.  


I realized this the hard way when I got in a relationship with my ex who was Mexican. She was super nice, cute, and liked me a lot, but I could never get excited about her. I got with her because I wanted to see if I could love someone who wasn't my type, but sadly I couldn't. And she perceived that and the relationship ended.

New here (25F). I met this guy at bar last month (25M). He was super nice and we exchanged numbers. Fast forward 2 weeks, we go on a date and end up going back to his apartment to hang out with his friends. He was again really nice and even a little shy. I got along well with his friends and had a great time. I was about to Uber home and he insisted I stay. It was our first date so I told him I would stay but that I didn’t want to have sex (no shame at all to people who like having sex on a first date. It just isn’t for me). We talked for a while, we hadn’t kissed and he seemed kind of timid. But as soon as he turned the lights off to go to sleep he immediately took my clothes off and started trying to have sex. I was drunk but I told him no multiple times. He would stop and then 5 min later try again. Like he would get on top of me and try to guide himself in. Finally after a handful of times of me saying no, he stopped. We texted a bit after that and the next weekend we both went out separately with our own friends. I went home and he texted me asking if he could come over. I still hadn’t seen him since our first date. We were both drunk, but I responded and said “yes, but I need you to know I don’t want to have sex tonight”. He came over and was aggressively making out with me. Like hands to my neck, trying to take my clothes off, it just felt like it was heading to sex. So I stopped him and said, “seriously, I don’t want to have sex. I want to know you more first”. And he was like “no, it’s okay” and kept trying to like convince me with his body? Again, it felt aggressive. I like aggressive sex at times but not when I’ve been saying no over and over. We went to sleep and I thought for sure he would have been embarrassed the next day or at least a little apologetic. None of which happened. But I was so confused because he is so nice and kind sober and then shows these red flags when it comes to drinking/sex. Fast forward to last night... I stayed in with friends and didn’t drink and he started drunk texting me at 1am asking to come over. When I said no he said he really needed my help because his friends have left him. I didn’t respond and he started calling me over and over. I answered the last call and he had to have asked me 10+ times to come over. I kept saying no and then he said he was coming anyways. I told him seriously no, I will not let you into the building just go home. His tone changed and he said something under his breath so I asked what he said. He sounded angry and said, “nothing. I mean obviously I’m a little upset but it’s whatever”. And I was just like lol okkk. And then he changed his tone again to saying “I just want to see you. Don’t you want to see me? Why can’t I come over? Please? I miss you” and I’m like okay I’m ending this conversation. You need to Uber home. Be safe. I hung up and he CONTINUED to text me asking to come over saying he missed me (remember we have gone on ONE date) and when I wouldn’t answer he just KEPT calling me over and over. I never picked up. I thought for sure he would text this morning and apologize and he just acted like nothing happened and all was normal.

I (21F) went on a date with a guy (22M). I had a great time - we had lots of mutual friends, conversation flowed really well and I guess we both wanted to spend more time together so we kept ordering drinks. We ended up at the bar for \~3.5 hours, which is probably one of the longest first dates I've ever done.

Bit of my dating history - For the past \~2 years I've been dating much much older guys. Mostly well-established 27-28 year-olds who really spoiled me, so I was used to getting drinks, food, vacations paid for. I'm still a university student so the difference in lifestyle ultimately was the reason why my relationships with them couldn't last. Also I quickly realized the difference in the power dynamic also wasn't it. So I'm now trying to date guys closer to my age with the same lifestyle. But I forgot that most guys my age who are in university still aren't 100% financially free yet compared to guys I've dated in the past.

So anyway this guy took \~$80 on the train to come to where I am, and the bills were around $200. Even though he split bills, I really like him as a person and I think he really wants a second date with me also. But IDK most of my friends (my friends and I are pretty well off - we all are accustomed to dating older guys who afford our lifestyle) think him splitting the first bill is a red flag. 

What do you think? Please no hate on this thread.

Since we met, we were hanging out every day for the first 2-3 weeks, but as life got busy, we slowed down to about 2-3 times a week which I am completely okay with (distance makes the heart grow fonder). We’ve talked about getting into a relationship but he has a problem with emotions and feeling things towards woman after all the different heart break he’s been through. He says he knows mentally and physically that I’m the girl he wants to be with, but it’s going to take him time to feel a complete emotional connection for me. I’d say I’m a very trustworthy woman; I’ve never cheated or wanted to, I won’t ghost someone unless they are being creepy or overbearing, and I really really want to have a real relationship where I see myself getting married and having kids with the person. 

Here’s the thing, because of his emotional past, it makes it hard for him to give me the amount of effort and attention I think I deserve. For example, he never wants to go out with me whether it’s to dinner or to do some kind of activity (he claims because he isn’t financially stable enough nor does he like going out in general), when we hang out it’s always me going to his place and him playing video games for about 90 percent of the time, and he still has yet to come over to my place despite me asking several times. I cook for him all the time, I try to motivate him to get more things done, and I hardly ever complain when I feel like he isn’t treating me fairly. 

He acknowledges that he doesn’t treat me as good as he should. And he said he’s working on fixing it (for example he wants us to have dinner together once a week, and then have a more extravagant date once a month). I think that’s a small step toward the right direction. But I don’t know if he will actually stick to his word. He’s told his dad about me already and I know that I can trust him (in the sense I know he isn’t going to cheat). So here’s what I need advice on:

1. Is he going to gain that emotional connection to me anytime soon? I would love for us to become official soon (but not until he is ready). 
2. Does it sound like he actually wants to become better and keep me around?
3. Am I giving too much? I really enjoy seeing him happy but sometimes it’s hard when I’m not so happy myself. 
4. As of right now he isn’t really a man that I’d want my family to meet which is a really big deal to me. But I would feel awful for trying to change him to be up to my families standards; does it sound like he will change on his own with time?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1074866,public,self,I need some major relationship advice ASAP,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qa5bsx/i_need_some_major_relationship_advice_asap/,all_ads,6,,,

I’m 20. I feel old to be virgin, but not because I feel pressured, but because I’ve explored _soo much_ with toys (possibly more than those who have sex regularly), and am just very horny constantly.

I have Tinder just to pass time and I met this extremely good looking man there. He’s 25. He took me out, we met and he was very gentlemanly and chill. We clicked. However there are signs he might only be looking for hookups, which I think is 99% true. 

Here I have a guy I’d definitely fuck immediately if I wasn’t a virgin. 

I’m just scared of getting traumatized, because I know guys don’t care much about the woman’s pleasure it they don’t know her well. On the other hand, I don’t want to get to know him too well, cause then I might get attached and develop a crush.

My biggest fear is though that he will ghost me after sex, which shouldn’t be that bad If I haven’t developed a crush. But if we don’t know each other well, the sex won’t probably be mind blowing either.

I’m in college so most guys are also looking for hookups. COVID makes it difficult to form good friendships with any guys as school is online, and as I said I’d like some action but am still doubtful.

What should I do?

I’ve recently acknowledged that my overthinking of my dating life is a mask for anxiety. It took me a while. 

I’ve had one too many encounters where I meet someone, and we date for 1-2 months, and then intimacy happens only for them to lose interest or fade out. And time and time again, I blame myself. I think I was too easy, even if I waited quite some time to progress. Or I’ll start thinking, “where were the red flags!” And I start to overanalyze and look for the warnings–even when there were none. 

And when I do meet someone I might be interested in, I do two things. 1. I tell myself, “this won’t work out. It never works out, so don’t get comfortable and don’t get used to it.” 2. I get hopeful. Hopeful of having someone and doing dating stuff. And when it ends, I tell myself, “how stupid of you to have wished for anything else or even dreamt of a more positive future. You knew it would end like this, so why are you sad?” 

And this pattern of thinking makes dating very tough. I’m a people pleaser, and I crave a deep, meaningful connection. But, I know I self-sabotage by perhaps going for the wrong people. Which leads to a thinking pattern of “you have high standards that don’t match you. You can’t have those high standards because you don’t even live up to them.” And this is sooo hard and drives my anxiety up. 

When an interaction ends, I always ask, “what did I do?” When maybe it had nothing to do with me. And even if I didn’t officially date them and our interaction lasted less than 2 months, I inevitably feel hurt. And I don’t know how to break this pattern. My only serious relationship lasted 6 months, and that was back in 2018. Since then, I’ve had casual relationships or dead-end meet-ups. I’d like to have a meaningful relationship one day. My birthday is coming up, and I always feel sad that I’ll be “alone.”
