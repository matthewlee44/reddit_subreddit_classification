21,ptflh4,1632340610,How much contact with an abusive ex is ok,"I (36M) started dating this woman (42F) last summer who I've known for some time now as we used to work together. About 2-3 years ago she came out of an 15 year long relationship with a man who was mentally abusive to her. She spent years trying to get out of that relationship and is still in therapy because of it. They have two children together. What worries me is how much contact she still has with this guy. They talk and meet fairly often. She frequently mentions stuff that is going on in his life like who he is dating or how well he did on a marathon last week. Yesterday she attended his birthday. Stuff like that. I know and accept it is normal to keep in touch with your exes. I also understand they need to keep in contact because of the kids, but it seems like too much when taking their past into account. I imagine I would talk less to someone who had been abusive to me for years. But then again I am very much a noob when it comes to complex relationships. I haven't said anything to her about this and never will. And I would never put any sort of restrictions on who she can or can't spend her time with. But I still would like some thoughts and opinions.

Anyway, met him and his friend at this rooftop bar in Boston. They invited my friend and I over to to their table and the rest is history. Him and I stayed up way to late (he had work in the am), but it was so much fun. Ended up getting breakfast in the morning, swapped numbers and said we stay in touch.

We texted a little Monday but otherwise it’s been silent. We did swap insta’s, and I can see that he’s been viewing my stuff/ liking it. 

Idk, maybe it was just the thrill of it all, but dang, this girl is a tad smitten. I haven’t reached out since he lives super far away (He was visiting his friend in Boston/WFH), so I don’t see anything moving from here, but low key wish it would. I guess I just needed to vent.
