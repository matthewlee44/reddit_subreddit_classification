Traditional 49F divorced 3.5 years in 7 month LTR w/53M.   This is both of our 1st “post divorce” relationship.  I focused on raising kids (currently ages 8, 12 &amp; 16) and had a highly contentious, 3+ year litigated divorce that had an enormous financial impact.  When I decided to begin dating last year, I was selective and thrilled when I met him as we are highly compatible, great chemistry, knew mutual parents from our kids private schools; same faith; and very kind.  I had no experience when to introduce him to kids but I needed help with carpool 3 months into our relationship and he met my kids in an impromptu visit. They adore him.  He also met a cousin.  

He told me he loved me after a week; asked me to marry him at 6 weeks &amp; again at 3 months (I laughed and told him he was crazy but reciprocated my feelings at 2 month mark). 

So what’s the issue?  He’s STILL MARRIED but separated.  He told me everything upfront, but I still went out with him.   He wasn’t even separated when I met him but seeking advice from other divorcees.  He also happened to be using same attorney my ex spouse used so I chatted with him.  We communicated for 2 weeks before meeting IRL in which time he moved out and drafted a settlement to began divorce proceedings.  When we met IRL, we were super attracted to one another and got involved underestimating the timing and duration of his divorce.  Things were great until recently....

Now his wife and him are knee deep in litigation- she hired a PI and I’m being threatened with subpoena.  I’ve never met his children or friends and feel like Angelina Jolie.  On 2 separate occasions he invited me to meet his inner circle at their vacation home then reneged on both invites.  This week I’ve become passive aggressive and have been argumentative.

Yesterday I had a drink then provoked him in a text.  I sent him a mean message insulting him and told him he was a pushover too afraid to stand up to his wife for fear of losing his marital assets. Stupid I know but I’m in love with a married man and have become “the other woman” which I cannot comprehend.  I was hoping he would come over and talk (he normally does) or be more agressive in his divorce but for the first time he pushed back and told me I was out of line and hurtful.   

Is this a train wreck?  My heart is in love but my practical side says my irrational behavior will continue as I can’t go thru another divorce &amp; I should not have gotten involved with him until post divorce.  What do i tell my kids?  I don’t want to lie but it’s a mess. My ego says it ended it last night and this was lust.  I know he wants to continue a relationship with me (why wouldn’t he? He has a mistress) but something has to change.

Don’t be afraid to put me in my place as I know I need to talk to him but I don’t want to go back to “normal.”

I got home and he had, in fact, deleted his profile. Then, an hour after our date he started texting me. Just random stuff, like, what kind of music do you like? It seemed like a lot given that we had just spent three hours talking. And he texted me many, many times last night.

I hate to sound harsh, and I’m fresh to this (we’ve been split for 3 months now) but I just don’t see myself being comfy, confident, and trusting of the future in a relationship with someone with similar issues.

I would like to lose 30-50 more pounds but I cant promise that I will or when I will. So anyone I date should like me as I am right now. No weight loss advice required. 🙏

No children, own place, own car. Im divorced and a domestic violence survivor. I work in human services so I dont make a ton of money but I do ok. Im self sufficient. Im not upwardly mobile in the sense that Im ok where I am  career wise and have no desire to chase a higher paid stressful position-in this field or any other.  I have the necessary credentials to do other kinds of human service or nursing work but elect to do one-on-one human services work because it allows me to develop a bond with my clients and their families and its low stress. High stress is extremely triggering for me. So I tend to avoid it. 

On the other hand Im neat , clean, keep myself and my car and apartment spotless.  I dress in clean, well fitting clothes that are age and body appropriate. In other words nothing too tight nor too loose. I get my nails , pedicure, and eyebrows professionally done Bi weekly and have excellent hygiene. In other words there are no hygiene issues.

My frustration is that despite all this I have zero luck with online dating and I only occasionally meet men IRL. I get a few responses but the men either have negative preconceived stereotypes of larger women (that we are lazy, have poor hygiene,  are easy targets for sex)  or just want sex when I only do LTR or marriage. 

Some of the men who respond are younger and I am automatically suspicious. Of their motives. Also men who ask when they can (come see me) or want me to come see them at their home and not in a public place are blocked because I assume they are looking for easy sex which they wont get from me.

I know a post op trans woman, she came out as trans three years ago. She lived as a man for 30 some odd years.  She has had two surgeries, FFS and bottom surgery last fall. She completely passes as a woman and has been taking hormones for three years. I have seen the equipment downstairs and it is very realistic. 

It's been months since her surgery, she has started online dating. I am happy for her, and encouraged her to meet someone nice. 

Here is the problem...

Last Tuesday she hooked up with a man from Tinder and DID NOT tell him that she is trans. I asked her if she told him, she said 'no' but didn't care because she wanted to 'loose her virginity'. He was the first guy she slept with after bottom surgery. 

I know we hear 'trans women are women', and from that perspective a crime didn't occur. 

**Argument One**: A lot of people get sex via deception by omission, the law can't remedy every single wrong one commits against another. It is illegal to get sex by fraud, or even by impersonating a celebrity. 

Many of us would not have slept with someone if we had known certain things about them, and they keep secrets to get sex. 

**Argument Two**: This is a sex crime and should be prosecuted as such. If one is guarding secret information that would be crucial for an individual to make an informed decision whether or not to engage in sex, that rises to the level of sexual assault.

Hopefully we can agree what she did was morally wrong. Was it illegal? Should it be illegal? Can we blame the victim for not doing his due diligence before sleeping with someone?

I know that according to the law, if you have an STD you must disclose before sleeping with the person. If however, one is HIV positive, undetectable and doesn't transmit the virus to anyone can/should they be prosecuted for failing to disclose? Lets say the partner didn't contract HIV, by they are traumatized to learn someone they were sleeping with knew they had it and failed to disclose. How is that  trauma ""different"" from the trauma of finding out you've been sleeping with a post-op transwoman whom, 'accidentally on purpose' didn't disclose because she wanted to lose her virginity? 

This entire situation is so epically screwed up, I do not know what to do, think or say about it.

**TLDR: GF is spending time with a recent ex in a way that I feel is disrespectful of our relationship.**

My (51 M) GF (49 F) and I have been dating just over 2 years now. We live about 80 miles apart, and because of job and family situations that’s not likely to change anytime soon. We had a messy breakup last November, and we decided to get back together in March. We try to see each other in person once or twice a week, text pretty constantly, and talk on the phone a lot.

The breakup was triggered by differing opinions on parenting styles (I have kids, she does not), and she ended up getting into a heated argument with my teenage son who lives with me. During the breakup, I moved on (too) quickly and began dating immediately. When we got back together, I completely cut ties, blocked and deleted the person I had been dating. Her words at the time were “if I catch you talking to anyone we’re done”.

She waited a couple of months after the breakup and started seeing someone (call him Joe) who lives about a half mile away from her. It started as mutual support, and eventually they started dating and had sex. She says that she dated him even though she didn’t see it going anywhere. I don’t judge her for dating him, but after we got back together she wanted to keep him as a friend.

So…the problem I need advice on is that she still spends time with Joe at night, and these things often come together without any advance notice or planning.

I absolutely think that women and men can be friends, even exes and past sex partners. I also think that even in a relationship, you should get to choose who your friends are. I don’t mind her being friends with Joe, but I do have a higher sense of awareness about people I know are exes and past sex partners, especially recent ones who are not deeply embedded in her friend group. With men who fit in that category, I feel very strongly that they need to be people we see together, that she sees in group activities, or if she spends one on one time it should be in public and daytime/early evening hours, and sleepovers should be out of bounds.

While they were dating, she had pushed Joe to apply for a promotion at work. Last month, he was selected for the promotion and as part of that, he was moving to a different branch office in the same metro. His coworkers wanted to take him out to celebrate, and he had invited her as his guest. She agreed, and I had a real problem with the idea and insisted she not go. My issue was that her only connection to the event at a bar she didn’t like and coworkers she didn’t know was him, and I felt it wasn’t appropriate. She wound up not going, but she felt like she should have been there for him in his moment, and wasn’t happy. From what I hear, this turned into a late evening, past midnight, and he got very drunk. All of which reinforced my thinking about the issue, that it wasn’t just a work celebration and better that she’s not part of it.

Worth noting that I did not like feeling like I controlled this. We've talked about him extensively over the last few weeks, I'm OK with him being her friend. I just think it needs to be a more casual, arms-length thing for now since it's so recent.

Last weekend, she had been out with one of her best (female) friends drinking, and continued when they got home. Somehow she ended up talking with him, and he ended up drinking with them at her apartment. It didn’t go well, he got kind of stupid and belligerent and hitting on her friend. She had to walk to his apartment after 1 AM to check on him, since he insisted on driving himself home drunk. Then she had to spend two hours there calming him down. He’s been apologizing to both of them all week.

So this weekend, I had spent the night with her Friday and came home Saturday morning. We’ve been texting all afternoon and talked a couple of times, a pretty normal day. Around 10:30 PM Saturday she told me she was going for a walk. I had to pick up my son from an event, and I got home around 11:30 PM. She texts me then that she walked over to Joe’s and they’re watching TV with his son. I felt misled by this…how does a normal fitness walk end up with her there? I called her a little after midnight while she was still there and talked for a few minutes. She said she was going to leave and walk home soon. I haven’t heard anything since. Text messages, even those sent before talking on the phone are unread. Now my anxiety is up and I'm losing sleep over it.

The thing is, I actually do trust her. I don’t want to control her. I don’t think it’s my place, and I also don’t think it’s my place to issue anything resembling an ultimatum. I don’t need to know her movements or activity 24/7. I don’t think I’m jealous of Joe, but I feel like her actions with him are disrespectful of our relationship.

Help! 

So....yesterday (Saturday) morning, I’m queuing in the “come get your kid” line after my daughter’s gymnastics class. 

We still have a few more minutes before the kiddos start streaming out, so I’m just looking around at the usual faces, thinking about lunch. Then I look left and notice a Black man staring at me, from behind his mask, of course. 

For context, there aren’t many “brown” children (or parents) who train there, so naturally, when I see another POC, I am intrigued.  Hell...to be completely honest, as a single woman-of-a-certain-age, if I see a lone (and ringless) man in any setting, I’m intrigued, but that’s a whole ‘nother post. 

So, i meet his gaze and he’s looking at me with such intent that Im thinking we know each other.  Happens often with these masks. He says “Good Morning”. I return the greeting. He’s still staring.

About me: I haven’t been in a relationship or dated in over 5 years. Not all that long, but Ive always been the relationship-type, don’t really know how to “date”, and the current (NYC) dating scene is depressing at best. To boot, I am very much an introverted extrovert. I’m chatty with friends, but detest “small talk”. I can be quite social and engaging; however, I am very anxious around new people. Crowds induce heart palpitations and “the spotlight” makes my stomach do backflips. I am told I’m graceful, but usually feel pretty awkward in my skin. Ugh. Anxiety be damned!! (Work in progress!)

Considering this, dude staring but not speaking almost makes me want to throw up my hands and scream WTF?!?!, but I stay quiet and say (to myself): girl, he’s new and checking out the scene. Probably equally surprised to see another Black face. Chill out! 

I’m not even looking at him, but he’s speaking to me again! He says “how are doing today?”  

Me (again, to my introverted self): WHY is he talking to me? Doesn’t he see me standing here with my arms crossed and looking down scrolling my phone so I don’t have to look up and acknowledge his gaze? Can he not read body language??? (deep sigh from the depths of my soul)

I turn to face him and his eyes brightened and kinda lifted, as if he were smiling.  I reply ”I’m doing very well, thank you! How about you?”  He says “I’m good. Really good”.  Still staring. Still smiling. Not missing a beat. 

(Me taking to me again): wait a damn minute... is this man flirting with me or have my allergy meds rendered me delusional?  Girl just shut up and wait for baby girl to come out and you can eat. 

So the kiddies start coming out and reuniting with their parental units. His daughter comes out before mine. He gathers her, turns to me, pauses, smiles, looks me square in my 4 eyes (I wear glasses) and says “I hope you have a wonderful Mother’s Day.”

Ok so that touched me in a profound way and I have no idea why. Such a small gesture of kindness and I was just about floored. And in that moment, I felt myself soften. And for the first time in our brief exchange, I smiled. 

Then stupid, anxious, self-sabotaging me ALMOST said “I hope your wife or girlfriend does as well”....but my Guardian Cupid firmly smacked me across the face and i came to my good, rational senses and instead thanked him and said “and I hope you have a wonderful weekend as well!” And this time, I did not look away. 

So the question is...was he flirting or am I trippin? I’m a little slow at times, but definitely no dummy, and kind of feel like he could have been, but how would I know?  In our current, masked, society how can you tell that someone is flirting with you when it’s subtle, non verbal, and most of their face is covered by a mask??  I just need some help y’all because I am clueless. 

But one thing is for sure, I’m putting on mascara next Saturday. 😉 

Thanks for your input and good luck to you all in this 40+ dating landscape. This crap is harder than childbirth. 

Lastly, for anyone concerned: the potential flirting did not offend me, as much as it clearly offended my anxiety. ✌️",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,47482,public,self,,,Flirting while masked: How do I read signals??

And I always make a point to thank them for dinner at the end and again at the end of the date.

Also, with both, we had a great time and ended up at least holding hands/kissing/affection.

- many of them say they are “god fearing” in their profiles

- they’ll say they’re from the states but invariably say they’re been educated at some foreign university

- they say they like football but then show a soccer ball, which is a dead giveaway that they’re not American

- many of them say they’re doctors or military affiliated

I've been journaling a lot and wanted to share some of what I've come up with that's made this year possible. 
1) Don't be afraid to take a chance. I was just about ready to call it quits on dating.
2) It's ok to let your guard down. When you're not constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop, living in the moment, your best self shines.
3) Communication is key. Talk. Often. Talk about what you need and expect, what you're willing to give. Talk about everything! 
4) Be flexible
5) If you feel it, say it. You owe it to yourself and your partner to be honest. 
6) Time together is a gift. At our age we have so many responsibilities. Don't be afraid to ask for time alone. 
7) Be a good listener. Pay attention. Be attentive.
8) Learn yours and your partners love language. Then learn best how to speak that language. 
9) Don't be in a rush. That which grows slowly endures.

On date #2 I told bf the feelings we had were just hormones and would fade away. Remarkably they haven't. Limirence is still high. I made a decision not to be so guarded and we talk about everything! We are building something. Right now, it's a strong foundation for meeting and growing a relationship with his pre teen son. I know it will be better because WE are on solid ground.

When things closed down we got in a routine of hanging out at his house twice a week, fooling around, cooking dinner, and talking for \~6 hours. It was casual, but when we started spending more time together and things seemed on the verge of getting serious, he prompted us to take a ""pause"" and think about what we wanted while I was out of town for a few weeks. 

While still out of town, him and I talked over video. I wanted to date, but he said he wasn't comfortable with it because A) he worried about doing something that might affect his relationship with his kids (14 and 17 at the time, he had a pretty amicable divorce \~10 years ago) and B) he felt that it would bother him down the road when I couldn't relate to his aches and pains of turning 50, 60, etc.

I accepted these reasons even if I didn't agree, and thought that was it, but when I got back into town next week, he invited me over to hang out, and it was clear he still wanted to fool around. Nothing happened, but after one more time of this I told him we couldn't be friends like this, and I was done.

I spent the next few months getting over him, improving my life, and one day he texted randomly, inviting me over to hang out. I was curious and bored, so I went. We fooled around, and I decided I was all for it, as by then I no longer had feelings, and figured a purely physical thing would be mutually beneficial. Well, the following week I texted him to see if he was free for another hookup, and he texted me back ""I think we should refrain from having anymore se\_ual encounters"". I was confused and hurt, but it made it clear there was absolutely nothing for us to have contact over in the future.

We stopped talking again for 6 months, then this year when he heard one of my family members passed away, he reached out to ask how I was doing. Since then we have had 0 se\_ual contact, but we have hung out a handful of times. He has been kind enough to fix my car on two occasions, meet me for coffee to help with schoolwork, and the other day he came by to help me with some painting. He never takes money for any of this or shows any se\_ual interest, but every time we spend 4+ hours talking after the fact talking about all kinds of things: his dreams, my career goals, our mutual hobbies, his kids and how they're becoming adults, etc. The other day before he left, he said something about how much he loved being able to talk like we did. It made me think back to all the talks we have had in the past. Last year I had gone over to his house to drop off a jacket he lent me. I had been in a hurry and never even got out of my car, but he ran outside when I drove up and spent half an hour leaning in my car window talking to me like a teenager. It was pretty funny.

I am wondering whether we are both at a point where we can just be friends. Is this possible after our history? When we were seeing each other he never once raised his voice, spoke unkindly to me, or was bad to me, however I felt so hurt and disrespected by what he did when he called me after months of healing, only to fool around once, and then cut it off the following week. I am much more cautious and guarded with him now, but I still enjoy talking to him so much. I have a good network of friends and family I can talk to, but the conversations him and I have are just incredible. I know there is nothing there romantically and that is off the table as far as I am concerned, but is being friends a bad idea?

Tl;dr: I casually dated an older colleague, then some weirdness happened, but now it seems like we are forming a natural friendship centered around great conversations.

Last spring my fiancé found selfies of her drunk in bars on his 13 year old sons phone. She had been messaging them to him. I found this highly inappropriate and concerning coming from a woman that was a mother figure to him for six years. My fiancé told me he handled it- was direct with her, telling her to not contact him or his son again. Then he blocked her from his and his sons phone. He also had a conversation with his son on his this was inappropriate and he was not to interact with her any more. 

There’s much more history- during their relationship, she would create fake FB profiles and harass women he worked with, and his sons mother. After they ended the relationship, she has sense befriended the sons mother and they are friends. 

Last night I found that she is friends with the son on FB since the fall and she likes every one of his pictures. Even after she was told to have contact with his son. And after the son was talked to as well. 

This does not sit right with me. I’m frustrated with my fiancé too, as I felt he brushed off the incident last spring and he should’ve been more aggressive with her.  I’m worried she will always pop in and create chaos. I would have to deal with her, if she had a child with my fiancé. But they don’t. She has no reason to keep coming around, especially when her interactions have been inappropriate!

What do you think about receiving daily “good morning beautiful” texts from a guy that you’re technically only “having fun” with, as opposed to consensually dating or in a committed relationship with?

What if he sends this text every day, but you barely hear from him the rest of the day? (To be fair, some days you communicate all day long, while on other days, it’s the only time you hear from them).

Do you ever feel like he’s just copying and pasting this message to a slew of women?

Do you think that it’s generic and lazy at best? (Compared to “good morning, &lt;your name&gt;)?

At first, I loved it. Thought it was cute, endearing, complimentary. It made me smile. But now, I kind of feel like it’s just something to say to be able he said something. 

Where I used to smile at it and become excited by it, I am now indifferent to it. Rather than return the greeting, I usually ask a question to encourage dialog (how’d you sleep? How’s your morning so far?). I usually get a response, albeit, only 1 to 3-words.

So, I shot her a quick message on Hinge because I could. I complemented her Phillies gear and mentioned that we matched on Bumble as well. Haha...isn't that a knee-slapping hoot? That kind of thing. 

I just checked Bumble a minute ago...she deleted the match and never responded on Hinge.

I have a new question for my wise redditors. 

I’m part of an online group that meets to discuss provocative philosophical topics. Yes, I’m a proud little nerd. I don’t attend all of them, but for the last 3 I did participate in, there’s a particular guy who happened to be in my breakout group each time. Not typical because it’s a pretty big online community. Anyway, we don’t look like an obvious match but we have the same dry sense of humor and I really like his intelligence and quick wit. The last time he started chatting with me directly and by the end of it asked to meet over dessert the next day at 6:30. I had plans. He was like “bummer” and that was it. Then I had to drop off. But I sent him message after the session with “raincheck?” — I’m very proud of myself people, as I’ve never “nudged” a guy about a date before. He replies with another day/time that doesn’t work and I throw in a couple of options that don’t work for his schedule. He was like “Oh well. Guess I’ll see you around online.”  Okay, so much for that. I figured he’s not that interested. A couple days later he sends me another message and we have been communicating by chat for about a week now. I really enjoy how he thinks. But here’s the thing: he won’t share anything personal. At all. I’ve shared where I’m from, that I have a kid, my occupation, even my heritage. I’ve asked, “what do you do?” enough times and in enough different ways to be sure he doesn’t want to answer the question. Red flag?  I contemplated suggesting we give another try to finding a day/ time to meet over dessert, but his withholding is giving me pause. Should I wrap this one up and move on?

Seeing as the AGR sub is mostly 19 year olds seeking affirmation that they are emotionally mature enough to date a 52yo, I am posting this here.

I am 43F dating 61M.  We get along in every way. Except... after what he describes to have been a 30 year long sexless marriage, I am so sexually frustrated due to a lack of it now.

He and I have been together almost 3 years.  There is great chemistry and I honestly enjoy all of the messing around. However, sex never lasts more than a few pumps.

He grew up and was married in a very stringent religion, so I have tried to give him as much time as possible.  I even introduced him to online porn and regularly encourage him to ""enjoy"" himself; hoping that might decrease him ammo.  Yet he will not take matters into his own hands (organized religion sucks!).

He's talked about taking the little blue pill, but he also has AFib and I am not willing to risk his health over sex.  But I am crazy frustrated.

I finally mentioned something a couple days ago and I know it irked him.  I didn't say I wanted to look elsewhere (I don't), but I also made clear my needs.

We still messed around the next day, but haven't spoken about it until tonight. Unfortunately over the phone.

We constantly bust each other's balls and he loves it when finds something that actually gets to me.  But this one is more difficult to take.  

I don't know. I don't exactly have people to talk with this about.  I can't think of anyone who needs to have that kind of info.

Will do my best to keep it brief.

About 3 years ago, my wife and I separated, after a long period of divorce talk.  Because ours was an international marriage, it necessitated that I move to Europe in order to ensure the kids had both parents.  While I wasn't keen on leaving North America, it was the only realistic option for the kids to have both parents.  My marriage was pretty bad, and I spent a fair bit of time talking to a therapist to root out and deal with my codependency and other cringy behaviours.  

Fast forward, I met a woman in Europe.  We matched on Tinder, and at the time, I was splitting my time between her city and the city in which my kids live (200 miles apart).  We seemed to hit it off.  She was kind, empathetic, and early on I felt comfortable being vulnerable around her, and shared some of my past and present fears.  

I decided to plan our first weekend together out of the city, so I asked her if she'd be interested, to which she enthusiastically said yes.  Due to my co-parenting arrangement, there were some logistical challenges with flying to Italy or somewhere really romantic, and it became clear I'd have to organize something in country.  She was still keen.  I think settled on a city about 200 miles away from her residence, and about 200 miles away from where my kids lived.  I called her, pitched it, and she was keen to go.  I then said, look, the only challenge is that on our return day, i need to pick up my kids around 3pm, so rather than driving you 200 miles back home and then driving a further 200 miles, I'll buy you airfare to fly back home, and ill drive directly to my kids (saving me 200 miles).  THis resulted in an immediate meltdown and a cancellation of all plans, as it ""wasn't a weekend together if i didnt drop her off at home"".  It honestly confused the hell out of me, as up until that point, she'd been so accommodating everything (often times things I didnt even ask for or want), that it seemed like suddenly the Matrix had glitched.

Things continued on quite well, but at a certain point, as my job didn't require me to have any physical location, i decided i would no longer rent two apartments, and instead would maintain a single residence 200km away from her.  We discussed it, and I understood it might be a deal breaker, but she offered her apartment for me to come stay at so that we could continue the relationship.  

In the meantime, she was still super nice, super kind.  She would get me birthday gifts on the monthly anniversary of my birthday--which seemed super sweet...but also a little much.  I tried to gently tell her that all this gift giving wasn't necessary--though it was nice.  Anyway, a month or two later, we are standing in her kitchen, and she's being super nice, and at a certain point, i said to her, ""hey, look, it's awesome that you're so accommodating, but I want to know what YOU want as well that will make you happy"".  To which she responded, ""Nothing, you're perfect, you dont need to change a thing"".   We then discussed that I needed to sign my son up to a sports league, which she fully supported, understanding how important it was for me to ensure my kids didnt get short changed as a result of divorce.  Fast forward a week later, i signed my son up, and unfortunately, this reduced the amount of time i could spend with her by 1 day, from 4-5 days a week to 3-4 days a week, depending on the week).  And once again, meltdown.  First, a few days of silent treatment.  Followed by, ""You're the most selfish person, do you ever think of anyone but yourself?"".  

And from that point on.... It was a slow decent from hero to zero.  She demanded that I support her year long trip to an asian country (for work, cancelled due to COVID), but kept telling me that I wasn't giving her enough by spending 3-4 days a week with her.  Suddenly I was an ""unhappy person, who didnt love himself, who was selfish, who didnt ask her enough questions and wasn't sufficiently interested in her life and wasn't planning enough trips with her (during COVID!)"".

In the end, I tried to break up, but the loneliness of being in a foreign country was too hard, and came crawling back, thinking I'd screwed it all up and the person I met in the first six months would come back if I just fixed things.  Which I'm sure if you've read this far you've realized didn't happen...nor could it, because that person wasn't real.

In the end, I realized all her people pleasing bull$hit was just that...bull$hit.  Her real desire which she confided to me in the end was that I'd move in with her full time (and presumably abandon my kids).  

This is the kind of thing that makes people not want to date anymore... (and yes, I'm sure i have plenty of blame to carry here).

I realize this is the internet and I fully expect people to reach out, unsolicited and without asking.

I was curious to know: 

1. Does cold chatting work? Like are there guys who have met women through randomly hitting them up for chat?

2. Why do you want my email to chat more intimately? We are already privately chatting, that seems like a red flag and code for ""married"" to me?

3. For the bold guys who lead by providing the erotic novel version of the ""Naked Man"" from ""How I Met Your Mother,"" does that really work? Because I just snark and block.

4. I ask how you found me, and you say you read my comments and post and think I am charming and intelligent, but I have stated many times in my comments I am not dating, I am looking for friends, etc and I say that to you. Still, the conversations seem pushy and hinting toward feeling out if I mean that. Does that ploy work?

5. You have an account that is new, has no posts, but you seem really astute at finding me to ask for help as a new Reddit user? Does that really work? 

I am just curious how well this works for dating on here? Any success stories? Any funny stories? How often do the scammers accidentally connect with another scammer to have an 80s sitcom moment?

I know everyone has what works specifically for them but just wondering what is the “norm” per se.  I’m in an exclusive relationship with this guy and we’ve been together for over 2 years.  As of now we only see each other 1-2x a week. Usually one weeknight date for a couple hours and then one weekend day/night for a little longer.  

We don’t live together and only spend overnights together if we take a trip, which is usually 2-3 short trips a year.   He has family living with him at his house so it would be awkward for me to sleep there. And I have 3 teenagers so he is very cautious about staying over too long (long story, I was in a bad living situation in my last relationship which affected my kids quite a bit) and he doesn’t feel comfortable spending the night at this point. (My kids and him do get along great though.) 

We used to see each other almost daily pre Covid but that’s because we worked at the same company so we’d do lunch almost daily and say bye to each other end of day and go out after work a couple times a week.  Now I work somewhere else.  We live about 25-30 min away from each other.  

It’s getting harder on me the more the relationship progresses to be apart so much and I’d like us to see each other more. I also want to respect his level of comfortability without pressuring him. 

*Side note, he also has his own side business that takes up some of his time in addition to his regular job. *

We haven’t always had the best communication because he struggles with it and isn’t used to transparency and being straightforward.  We both have been in bad relationships and had bad parents so there is insecurity and sensitivity that comes into play when bringing things up. I’m more open to talking than he is but he’s getting better overall for the most part.  

My questions are how often is normal for 2 busy adults to see each other and how can I bring this up???",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,47719,public,self,,,Feedback wanted,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/na6opr/feedback_wanted/,,some_ads,7,,,,

We agreed it was casual. He was literally working on the Covid vaccine trials for Pfizer and was working crazy hours. I get it.

I felt like after the second time we had sex he was dropping off like he wasn't as interested. He would go four or five days without answering a text. Also it was really weird because he didn't want to have me over to his house and wouldn't say why. And please don't tell me he is married. I know for a fact that he is not. He could have been seeing some one else for sure. 

So he kept saying he was busy and I said it takes ten seconds to text some one that you are busy. I finally just told him I wasn't interested anymore but wanted to stay friendly. We met in a support group (thats how I know he isn't married unless he has been working a long con for 6 years.) That was in November. 

He would send me memes and and I would respond but then I just kind of dropped off. I got a text from him last week and he was asking if I wanted to go out and do some thing and ""have some fun"". I just ignored it. Maybe I'm turning into a horrible person. Then he texted me again on mother's day with all these compliments and wished me a good day. 

We texted a bit then last night he asked if I could come over to his house Friday for dinner and a movie. I'm assuming Netflix and chill. I know this sounds stupid but I don't know what to say. I feel like he is buttering me up to have sex and then he is going to breadcrumb me again. 

My friend suggested that I just tell him I think we want different things or ask him what has changed from last year. I know the trials aren't as bad as they were. He said he isn't as crazy busy as he was in the past. 

If he were just some guy I was never going to see again I think it would be easier to know what to say.  I don't want to jump into a relationship at all and I'm not gaga over him. But I would like to have some honesty. Maybe he has avoidant attachment style.
