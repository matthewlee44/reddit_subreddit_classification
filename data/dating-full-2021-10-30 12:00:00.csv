Now we haven't talked since yesterday and she doesn't seem to want to text first.

What I'm wondering is :

Was she even interested in the first place?

 Is she still interested?

Is she too shy to text first and waiting for me to make a move?

Should I wait again to give her some space?

I am 18F. Guy is 22M. Most bizarre date ever. 


So my family is well-off but obviously I don‚Äôt advertise this. My parents have actually warned me about male gold diggers before but I dismissed it then because it is not like I am chasing gorgeous male models much younger than me. Anyway I agreed to meet this one guy from Bumble for coffee because he seemed ambitious, funny, stylish and quite normal. 


We met in line and I was ahead of him. He looked visibly annoyed when I asked for a slice of cake with my coffee but relaxed when I paid for my own order. He ‚Äújoked‚Äù lots about me being a poor student and kept asking if I only got the ¬£5 cake because I assumed that he would be paying for me. Extremely rude and ludicrous but whatever, maybe he just had a bad experience recently. I got my cake and I was going to eat it. 


We made some small talk and then I asked him what he does for a living, which seemed to really trigger him. He sighed dramatically and told me how it is obvious why every girl asks this question, then bragged about how he is an engineer making mid five figures but it is getting so hard for him to weed out all the nasty broke gold digging sl*gs. He went on and on about how females these days only care about a man‚Äôs money, that we all just want to use nice guys for free meals but of course he is way too smart to fall for that. According to him 50/50 everything is the only way to go even if his girlfriend makes a lot less, because equality and it is not his problem that she isn‚Äôt smart enough to get a STEM career. He finished with how marriage is nothing but a huge scam for modern men, that he will definitely insist on a pre-nup to protect his assets and that anyone who has a problem with that is absolutely a gold digger.  


He looked super smug like he just totally called me out and was waiting for me to argue or to prove myself to him somehow, but I told him calmly that I agree completely with what he said about a pre-nup being extremely important and that if I ever get married my family will definitely insist on one. He looked really confused for a minute and then started asking all kinds of probing questions about my family and my assets. I know not to talk about wealth but this guy was such a clown and I most certainly didn‚Äôt want to see him again so I just told him that my grandparents are gifting me a beautiful house in a posh neighbourhood. 


He got extremely excited and immediately started asking how I feel about moving in there with a boyfriend because I am an adult now and it is time for me to stop living with my parents. He then moaned about how he has hefty student loans and still has to pay an exorbitant amount to live in a tiny flat further away from the city with two other guys. He gushed about how great the location of the house is and how much money he could save if he didn‚Äôt have to pay rent at all. He even had the audacity to ask if I would eventually consider giving my boyfriend co-ownership of the house since he can contribute by taking care of the garden and whatnot. He then confessed that in spite of his cynicism he is just a romantic at heart who believes that marriage is amazing with the right person and that when there is true love, pre-nups just feel so cold and one-sided especially when overprotective families try to intervene. 


He then started bombarding me with negs (?) like how I seem smart for a non-STEM major and look alright for a tall girl. He kept talking about our bright future together in ‚Äúour‚Äù house, that ‚Äúwe‚Äù have the money to retire early and travel the world and creepy stuff like how our kids are going to inherit his IQ. He was extremely pushy about setting up a second date on the spot and declared that he would even be willing to treat me to a nice dinner to show his sincerity since it is ‚Äúour‚Äù money now. 


I faked an emergency, left, saw him typing furiously on the app and blocked him immediately. Total psycho with no social skills and zero self-awareness. At least nobody is falling for that.

Then on the second date we were drinking again, and the convo was great, i felt Really good. 

I offered him to sleep at my place since it was 2 am and we were drunk. So we went to my place, we were kissing But nothing else happened. 

At morning we woke up, and we couldnt talk a WORD. I mean I COULDNT TALK about nothing. I was so boring, and Really acted shy. I was Really anxious , and it was so so awkward. I just know he lost interest, he left and thanked the date. Thats all.

I Really liked this dude, and he liked me too. But then BUMM. I fucked it up with my anxiety. He must he thought that i am a boring person, and only fun when Im drunk. Which Im starting to think Its true. I feel Really down now and depressed.

Being that we're both gamers, we moved our conversation over from Tinder to Discord (a free messaging and calling app used to be primarily marketed toward gamers). We played some games together and planned to do it again sometime. Last night though (so Friday) I asked her out on a date. I just felt like we really connected well and the time felt right to me.

I get nothing for the rest of the day, then this morning she tells me she prefers to wait at least a week before going out with someone due to general safety and COVID and all that, which is completely fine, I can respect that. But I couldn't even respond to her. She blocked me on Discord and unmatched me on Tinder...

I'm not mad at her for having her standards, I just didn't know about them. I was going to tell her I'd wait as long as she wanted, and that I only asked because it felt like a good time to ask. I'm just frustrated, not at her, and not even at myself, but just at the fact things were going so good and they just ended at the drop of a hat.

So when I‚Äôm looking for women to maybe get to know and date, is it even logical for me to have standards? I‚Äôm not just talking about appearance, I‚Äôm talking about the way they treat me. If I want to be with someone, it might be hard to find someone who will treat me well, and considering no girl wants me now, it might be impossible for me, so I would have to settle if I wanted someone and that‚Äôd be with someone who treats me bad.

Even with things like hygiene. Girls that have good hygiene and take care of their bodies and health don‚Äôt want me, so doesn‚Äôt it make more sense just to be with someone with and hygiene if I don‚Äôt want to die alone?

* Dale Carnegie - How To Win Friends and Influence People. By the title, you may think it's a scummy sales book to mind-control people into getting what you want. Quite the opposite - it's more about how to earnestly get to know people, how to be kind to people, how to be a good conversationalist, and lastly how to get your needs met by sharing your common ground with other people. I learned a lot about interpersonal relationships from this book. It has paid many dividends.

* John Gottman - The Man's Guide to Women, and Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work. These books go hand-in-hand in my opinion. They both talk about ways to navigate conflict by understanding women's communication styles better, with decades of academic research from the ""Love Lab"" to back it up. You'll learn to avoid many fights before they ever begin, which leads to longer and more fulfilling relationships.

* Logan Ury - How to Not Die Alone. The biggest thing I learned from this book is to stop waiting for perfection and to go with the next person who meets my needs. In the age of Tinder and dime-a-dozen dating partners on apps, it really focuses on how to narrow your search to what you need and not what you want.

I've asked out several girls over the years, all rejections. I'm not the kind of person who typically asks people out cold turkey but instead tries to get to know the person somewhat deeply beforehand. In the past, I drug it out too long and guaranteed that platonic feelings dominated. Over time, though, I've learned to cut to the chase pretty quickly. I've had ""things"" with several girls who were varying degrees of into me that ultimately led to rejection at least in part because they believed I was too good a person to risk getting onto bad terms with. If it was one girl in isolation saying this, I'd just assume it was some BS she made up to avoid hurting me, but I'm now at several, and one of them even initiated and pursued me before coming to that conclusion. I want to stress this has never been the \*ONLY\* reason, but has been the most common thread.

Now personally, I do try to be the most reasonable, comforting, and nonjudgemental person I can be. But, overall, I can't sit here and say I'm this incredible being, just someone who wants good things for good people. Pretty typical I'd say! The few ideas I have are:

\- It's purely coincidental that girls say this as a copout to avoid hurting my feelings.

\- My confidence is low and it's a huge turnoff, but it makes me come across as gentle. The thing is, I have a self-deprecating, sarcastic humor that isn't really self-pitying at all, but maybe it's still too much and that contributes to a ""modest, too nice"" thing. I also am incredibly uncomfortable with making \*others\* uncomfortable, so I overthink ""making moves"" because I might be reading the situation wrong.

\- I'm attracted to girls with self-esteem issues who feel they're beneath me, a person who tries to treat them with respect in all situations (not saying this in a self-congratulatory way). This has been an interesting one because I've ultimately gleaned this from a couple of them and it made me kinda sad for them.

Personally I'd take a guess that it's some combination of the last two points. I absolutely have self-image issues to work on, but I've at least become less scared of rejection over time to the point where it's not a huge deal. I have respect for myself, I'm just unnecessarily hard on myself (if that makes literally any sense on my confidence situation). I tend to be attracted to girls who are on a similar frequency as I am which might invite similar confidence issues to myself, which really sucks because these are the kinds of girls I can instantly connect to as a person who can't always easily get on with people. A few of the girls who've rejected me have been my closest friendships, and I value that immensely; I just want that with someone I connect with romantically, too.

I'm sort of at a loss for what to do if I ever want to have a dating life. I know to generally ""work on my self-confidence"" and that ""it's a numbers game,"" and I've basically been slowly but increasingly improving those things. I'm not really scared of rejection anymore, I'm more open and social than ever, I've lost a ton of weight, and I'm working on a career I'm passionate about. I've gotten the same advice from multiple other guys to ""get a little cocky."" I just cannot see myself ever passing that off as my real self, but maybe I'm taking it too literally. Perhaps I just need to keep doing what I'm doing, improving myself at the pace I'm working at and hope something finally works out.

Last year, I started to go (for really short period of times, subscribed for a day and delete just right after I found an interesting match and waited a lot of months to recover from the previous date) on dating apps. I admit that I use snap filters (not the ones with animal stuff, or some crazing sparkles just the ones which smoothes the skin) because I am extremely insecure about the way I look. If you would think it‚Äôs because I am overweight or obese, I am far from it (I‚Äôm actually tall and thin). To explain my dating experiences.

I‚Äôve met a guy on a dating app who was looking for a serious relationship. It didn‚Äôt work bc I was way too shy and awkward at the date. But we had sex. Later I created a catfish account to know why he ghosted me, he told this fake account that I was nice, beautiful but boring.

Months later, I subscribed to another dating app for something not serious at all, I didn‚Äôt have any expectations. I matched with a guy, with who, I had great chemistry, we even sexted. A few days later, I learned that he was actually married (he is quite much older than me, early 30s) for 7 years. I‚Äôve been in obsession with him and wanted to meet him at all costs. I‚Äôve made researches to find his real name, so I knew about his address and where he works. I‚Äôve been in front of his house just to see in what kind of house, neighborhood he lives. Later, I‚Äôve been to his job (he works in a theather as a projectionist) to tell him that I‚Äôm gonna tell everything to his wife. He told me he didn‚Äôt want to cheat on her anymore. Later in the conversation (I didn‚Äôt threaten him), we‚Äôve been intimate and made out in the local. He told me when I actually met him that I correspond to the pictures that I sent him, that he found me too cute to resist.The story stopped there because he decided to stop his cheating behaviors. And it‚Äôs better like that.

Not dating app related, I‚Äôve been looking for new friends to meet in the new city I moved for my studies on twitter. A guy responded and he asked me to send him pictures of my face to see what i look like. I was only for friends not for dating!! The guy couldn‚Äôt stop telling how pretty I look, how beautiful I am. I kept insisting that I am Only there for friendship. He clearly told me that he wanted to hug me, and hoped more than a friendship when he saw my pictures. So, I‚Äôve met him, we ended up in an airbnb, we didn‚Äôt talk that much in the car, just because he didn‚Äôt know where to go and I had no idea because I didn‚Äôt know the city. I didn't find him attractive. Just right after I chose a playlist and sat on the couch, he started to pull me next to him. I told him and pushed off of him ¬´¬†it‚Äôs way too soon¬†¬ª, and he replied ¬´¬†i like you, I want you¬†¬ª. Since I was lost, felt completely lonely, I stayed in his arms and imagined that I was with the ¬´¬†previous married guy¬†¬ª. I admit that I made out with him because I was quite horny, I turned off the lights to not have seeing his face. During the made out session, I didn‚Äôt want to do certain things, I said that I regret, it shouldn‚Äôt happen. I almost cried. The morning after he left, I blocked him.

Around 2 weeks later (around the last 15th october), I decided to log in again in a dating app, I didn‚Äôt have any expectztions. A guy sent me a ¬´¬†crushnote¬†¬ª to tell he he found me beautiful. I discussed with him, I insisted to meet him in a public space. So he accepted with no problem. I told him that I wasn‚Äôt looking for a serious relationship, just chilling and see what will happen. That I don't think you can find a serious relationship on a dating app (I still think the same). So we chatted and we decided to see each the next evening. He picked me up in his car, we went to a rather fancy restaurant. He paid me two cocktails and for my meal. He said that he invinted me. I had a good moment with him, the feeling was good, he told me that he found me charming (he was sober) and he liked me. We went to his house, we chatted a lot in the car. I wore my pjs, same for him. We chilled and sat on the couch. We were about to watch a movie on netflix but he started to kiss me. After I drank (alcohol, I never drink alcohol in general but I wanted to this night to be more extroverted), him as well (but I was much more drunk than him, I even wanted to vomit later). I was quite in the defensive at first because I planned to be more serious and not having sex so fast. Since I was drunk, I told that I am not really confortable with my body and it could impact my sexual experiences. He was really flirty, slowly touching me, he couldn't stop compliment me (that he liked my body, that he found me attractive, that I am beautiful, that I have a nice smile....). I was getting more horny, so I slept with him (I didn't regret this time). He drived me at my uni next morning. When we left, he told me that we could meet another time if I wanted to. He texted me the same day later to ask how I was. We talked the next week (it led to sexting). I wasn't feeling it that much, so I didn't try to talk him, he didn't send me anything neither. Last time we talked was a week ago. I was really busy btw and too tired. But for whatever reasons I dreamed of him twice since then. He didn't block me and same for me.

From what I explained, those expriences happened because I am probably much uglier irl or too different of my pictures? I admit that I posted selfies with a filter on on all of these experiences. Did those guys find me attractive or they were liars?

Other people (other than guys met on app), told me that I am pretty. But I don't believe it, and I've red experiences of guys who've been catfished because they didn't find the girl attractive irl. But could these guys still wanted to physical touches with those girls?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1109356,public,self,Am I a catfish?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qj545q/am_i_a_catfish/,all_ads,6,,,,

So I am in the hooking up stage in my life rn, and I met a guy on tinder. We hit it off real good, we talked about a lot of things for like a week when we finally met to get to know each other. The date was really good, we talked about everything, and though it started as a hookup he told me even if I dont want to have sex with him, he wants to be my friend and that he finds me amazing and beautiful. We texted in the next few days when one evening I just hit him up and at the end I went over to him.  We had great sex then cuddled for an hour then I went home. We were texting again, he was so enthusiastic and kind and everything, I started to get attached to him. Then on wednesday he asked me if I am free cause we planned a longer lovemaking and also he is into pegging and I was also eager to try it out and he was so happy I would be up for it (like not that many girl would be into that). And I wasnt free that day but the next morning he texted me again and I said I can be by him at 12, he was working from 3 pm. So I was just about to head out when I asked if he went to the post office to pick up the strapon he ordered? And he was like not yet but you want to do that now? And I was like we can do anything but I would be up to try it out. And he got very enthusiastic that then he will go to pick it up rn and I was like okay but then we will have less time together. He really wanted to do it, so he said he will text me when he picked it up, so we will save time if I go to his place when he texts me. And I was like okay. And since then nothing, he doesnt reply, didnt write anything. I wrote him today on an other platform which he saw but no reaction. So please someone give me ideas what could have happened in those 30 mins til he went to pick up the strapon which he wanted so much??

I‚Äôm a couple years into what I thought was the best relationship I‚Äôve ever had. He took such great care of me, gave me everything I could possibly want + more, is great with my family, supports me, etc etc etc. 

Recently I had a gut feeling that something was off, so I did a little investigating. I wish I hadn‚Äôt, because i uncovered a whole alternate universe of my boyfriend flirting with other women. And I‚Äôm talking, like, 10 other women over the last year. And this is not just being friendly, I‚Äôm talking about texts he‚Äôs sent to his female friends drooling over them, saying things like ‚ÄúI think about you every night‚Äù, while he‚Äôs laying in bed next to me. 

I don‚Äôt have proof that he‚Äôs ever cheated on me, but what I found was truly heartbreaking. We‚Äôre both in our thirties and I honestly thought he was the one. We live together, he has a wonderful daughter who I‚Äôve grown to love to pieces, and now it‚Äôs all gone. 

I don‚Äôt want to end the relationship but I feel so betrayed and blindsided. When I look at him I feel disgust. 

I will never trust him again so I don‚Äôt see the point in trying to fix anything. I‚Äôm so depressed I can‚Äôt bring myself to start the process of separating. My entire family is supposed to fly out to stay at our place for a week I‚Äôve thanksgiving - how will I tell them it‚Äôs over?

Anyways, I had joined a Discord server (yeah, yeah, I know) a while ago, and had been posting and chatting for a couple of months, getting to know everyone etc.

Eventually I started chatting about how some crazy stuff went down at work one particular night, and one person was really responsive and kept asking questions. Eventually I sent a PM cause we were cluttering up general, and continued to talk on-and-off for a while. It wasn't until a couple of weeks after we started talking that I even found out that it was a woman!

Anyways, she heads off to basic training for the military, and we obviously don't chat until she gets back. That was a long while ago now, but only recently have I been truly thinking about whether or not I like this person. We've been chatting somewhat regularly since she's come back, and... wow.

Now, obviously we've only talked over the internet, and in Discord of all places, but I've seen her photos and seen her face, and she's really cute! She is just a genuinely kind and caring person, and we have a ton of similar interests, and even the ones that we don't share, we both find interesting! She likes doing sculpting and v-tubing, I like TTRPGs and writing, but we both like weightlifting and anime.

So, to sum it up, I really, really like this person, and I'd be perfectly happy to just even be friends with this person, but I want to be honest about my feelings towards her before I start looking elsewhere for a romantic relationship. It's a weird romantic hangup I have that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, I know. It also is weirding me out that I'm invested in a wholly online relationship, which is a whole 'nother bag of worms that I don't really want to get into.

I'm struggling to get over someone.

It wasn't just a talking stage, we went on dates and spent a lot of quality time together, when apart we messaged and phone-called an appropriate amount, and it felt very much like the start to a relationship, only for it to end very abruptly. Essentially, I was dumped. This person was struggling with a few things and couldn't prioritise a relationship. (Side-note: I don't believe in the whole ""no such thing as right-person, wrong time"" thing. I understand that relationships are hard and if they aren't a priority they're going to become toxic anyway.) I said that I understood and I acknowledged their respect of me; most people don't communicate as well. After talking it through, I went no-contact with this person for my own closure and I moved on after a week or two of feeling disappointed and missing talking to them.

But, all was okay and healthy and normal.

And then, they came back. We were just going to chat and I wanted to try and harness some kind of friendship, because we really do get along, but they led me on this time round and led me to believe they'd changed their mind about a relationship. I ended up hurt and humiliated. I know that nobody owes you a relationship, but I felt that my feelings weren't taken into consideration given especially that I was the one who was ""dumped"". 

I guess, I know now that I was kind of being screwed over, and that's okay - I should just be able to roll my eyes and move on. But I'm hurt and upset that it was THIS person who screwed me over, the very first person (I'm nearly 20 and new to dating) I'd felt a connection to and who had treated me with respect and healthy communication until so recently.

Background- I'm a 29F. He's a 31M in a phD program for clinical psychology, works 2 jobs and grieving the unexpected death of his younger sister. 

 Month 1

was intense with what I feel was love bombing. Telling me stuff like ""I want to take you to X country"" ; you're do beautiful. You're a champion. You're the best at your job. You're amazing. I told my parents about what a beautiful woman I found. I can't wait to introduce you."" Shit like that. He then went to Mexico and got me treats and jewelry. It felt super nice but something inside me was feeling overwhelmed by all this attention. The first month was absolutely amazing. He was the perfect man. He tried rushing exclusivity but i told him to rein it in and I needed to take my time although at this point we'd already had sex, he'd slept over,  I'd slept over, etc. So it went fast... I got swept away with my feelings.

Month 2 

This is when the doubt starts creeping in for both of us. Something was telling me something was off about him. Then he started finding little things to fight about. I randomly found he was texting some woman who had the name of his ex wife on his phone and he was using endearing names with her. He got defensive and said it was his cousin. Our communication was fine. It was never aggressive. We were able to talk to normal humans but I just felt ""why are we even talking about these heavy LTR topics right now? We're only 2 months in...?"" Then he started saying stuff like ""you deserve better. I'm going to waste your time. I'm going to bring you down with me because I'm an incomplete man. I'm not going to have any time for you because of school and work and I'm grieving my sister. I don't want to disappoint you. I'm unfit to be in a relationship right now. I'm afraid to lose you and this has nothing to do about my feelings for you but I need to figure myself out. I'm not well. I don't want to hurt you and I know I am. If you'd met me before my sister died, you and I would be unstoppable. I would have for sure asked you to marry me."" So naturally, since he told me all this, I broke things off with him. He took it alright. He said our relationship was going to be different and would be awkward at first but that he wanted to stay friends. I was like okay whatever. 

Here we are present day. He texts me pretty consistently asking me about my day and such. His communication with me is terrible though. For example, he said he was going to meet up with me, we coordinated the day before and aligned. The next day I hadn't heard a peep from him. He left me waiting all morning and afternoon. I followed up with him asking whats going on. He immediately texts back saying my day was so crazy! I didn't get a chance to see you. My response - communicate better next time and proceeded to now ignore him because I deserve the common courtesy of proper communication. I'm busy just like everyone else. But I would never leave anyone waiting. I'd send a super quick text or voice note  - hey plans changed. I can't come see you. I'm sorry. He couldn't even do that. To me that's a complete disrespect and disregard for me and my time. And it feels like he's pushing my boundaries to see how far he can take it and I'm willing to accept.

We talked for around 2 and a half hours and it went really well, he calls me sweet, cute, pretty, and always texts me good morning and good night, asking how I am. I started to like him and he confessed that he liked me, so I told him as well. I always compliment him, on his voice, his face, his personality, thanking him for his compliments to me. He seems self-aware about how he looks around me, saying sorry that his hair is so messy, and when I ask him for a photo of his face, he says that he knows he looks tired because of a long day. He sends me Tiktoks of people in cute relationships, cuddling and such, and asks if I want to do it. I say that I want to hug him, he says that he wants to hug me too.

What worries me is that he's hooked up with six girls, and I have no idea how he treated those girls. I don't know if he treated them the same way he's treating me, as a way to lure them in and then break their hearts. He also asked for nudes, I don't send photos, so I said no, he was respectful about it and hasn't asked again since I told him that, but he's found other ways to engage in sexting like roleplaying and making scenarios. This doesn't happen all the time though, he's probably just horny as a 15-year-old guy.

I asked him if he was only interested in sex, and he said no. I guess I might be overthinking, but I'm just really paranoid that he's just using me, I've had guys whose personality completely changes as soon as they see what I look like, and I don't like it, so I'm just being extra careful with this guy.

Love is cultivated over many years and does not wax and wane like your mood. In my experience, women in my age group comprehend lust, which is the initial honeymoon phase that can last up to 2 years (based off personal experience). Then they turn cold for a few weeks/months and say ""sorry, I just don't feel 'it' anymore."" I'm a physician who deals with life and death on a regular basis, and to me, love is when you're holding your partner's hand as they receive a possible grave diagnosis or before they enter the OR for a complicated surgery. You can bet your ass that couples who care about and invest in each other's health are truly in love.

When I was born, my mom moved here with my dad from a different country and she supported him in every way she could when he was struggling to build a business. She never entertained the thought of cheating/leaving him because on some days he couldn't afford food on the table. To this day, my dad spoils the living hell out of my mom. If she so much as stares at jewelry while we're walking by, he's getting it as a gift for her the next day. But this new generation of women are different. They want to meet men already at the finish line and not at the beginning/during their journeys to become great men. There's an axiom, ""you test a man's loyalty when he has everything, but you test a woman's loyalty when he has nothing."" Nothing could be closer to the truth.

It's obvious I'm jaded by my dating experience, but these thoughts are not solely my own. A sizeable number of my male physician coworkers/friends have been through the exact. same. shit. We've all sworn off relationships and especially marriage. Granted, we're all living in materialistic cities like LA, NYC, and Miami so maybe that's the root of the problem. Regardless, it's a shame to witness what happened to this generation of women.

Initially we did not speak a lot, which was fine with me considering i was travelling. When I got back to Canada, he started messaging me more and more on Hinge, fully knowing I am in Canada. Eventually, we moved to texting and occasional calls. We would talk mostly every few days in a week. He would randomly disappear for a week or so and then reappear. I didn‚Äôt think much about it considering he is probably dating and seeing people etc. Over the past couple of months, we got close, where we started texting sweet nothings and being affectionate and even mentioned when we will meet. He said he wanted to make a trip up and see me, and if I can see him. He would constantly tell me I‚Äôm beautiful and smart and kind etc, and I would return the compliments because I genuinely liked him. We were flirty and sexting and having normal convos. This past week, he wanted some sexually suggestive photos and I don‚Äôt mind them but I wasn‚Äôt in the mood. The next day, he just changed completely. He was very distant and cold. I asked to call him and I told him why he‚Äôs acting cold and he told me he doesn‚Äôt know what I want him to do or say. I said I want you to go back to normal and be affectionate and he was like why. He had no issues before and now he‚Äôs got an issue!??! He kept mentioning we never met, and I am throwing myself to him, and becoming clingy. I don‚Äôt think I was. He continued to say he wants to be platonic and that I am acting desperate. I said if there is someone else and he said no. I asked if he wants to be platonic, and he said yes, and that there‚Äôs no hard feeling. He didn‚Äôt message for a day and suddenly he‚Äôs messaging again.

Guys, I am so confused. What happened ?  How can someone change so quickly? Was I being clingy? Too affectionate ? One moment, he was great and now he‚Äôs cold. I‚Äôm so confused.

He said he was his anxiety and he just wasn‚Äôt ready but I have no idea if I can trust his words right now. Recently he hasn‚Äôt been talking to me as much and it really does hurt.
