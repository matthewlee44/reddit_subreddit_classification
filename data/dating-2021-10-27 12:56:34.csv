And were constantly seek each other out if were not working in the same space that day. And its not just us picking on each other or having fun we talk about personal issues and deep topics and she loves to vent about whats bothering her. I can't help but feel in love when I talk to her or even think about her. I would asked her on a date but then I consider she might not be that intrested because she refers to me as her best friend. Leaving me thinking maybe I'm just a good friend in her mind. Also when we get talking other will say that we are cute together or tell us to stop flirting witch makes her shut down a little and says were only talking you can tell she doesn't like it when people say that. Another issue is an age gap shes 5 years older than me which doesn't bother me but I'm not sure if that would bother her I might be over thinking the age gap a bit tho. And I dont want to make work awkward if I ask her on a date and she doesn't want to.

When we first seen each other it was an instant attraction. I know I got so nervous when I first step out of my car and locked eyes with this tall handsome man. He also confessed he was in awe when he seen me to. This was around End of December 2020. After our first date we were pretty much hanging out everyday I didn't work and even days I did work. I basically was at his house more than my hotel. 
(Im.gonna skip details because I can talk about that moment and this would turn into a love novel)

So fast forward it was time for me to leave .y contract was up, even tho my job asked me to stay another month. I said yes, but had to change my mind because family issues back at home 3000 moles across the country. I had to take custody of my niece who was gonna go into foster care. (I couldn't live with myself if that happen even if I possibly met the love of my life)

So I left, we tried to keep in contact but he was so emotional and sad that he said he couldn't do the long distance thing, he couldn't bare not physically being around me and it hurt to see me on video chat and he can't hug me and so on. So we decided to end it. 

Months later he contacted me saying, I haven't stopped thinking of you and I let An amazing women go and guys when he said that I kid you not that previous night I cried myself to sleep missing that man. And when I received that text I was so happy.

We decided that we owe it to each other to see one another again. 2 weeks later he bought his ticket He flew here 14 hours and 2 flights later he arrived! We had a very good time! I fell for him all over again despite I had some things going in my life. That drew my attention from him, but it was amazing. 

Long story short he stayed 4 days. We now text and call each other. Always saying how badly we miss each other, and how we want to be in each other's arms. Just today I woke up to him saying he wish he could hug me right now, and right before that text arrived I was looking at the pictures we took when he easily here. So I know I should ask him hey what are we doing here? But I have we sort of talked about it, but we really didn't get anywhere.

After that relationship ended I had met another person who I thought would be my next ltr. She was a nice girl, was focused on school, did things nice with a very freaky side. However she wanted to hold off on sex till our 1 year so that our first time was a special one. I said cool, I was really into this girl and sex wasn‚Äôt a deal breaker for me. Fast forward about a month or two before our 1 year she gets cold and distant. I end up finding out that she cheated on me because we weren‚Äôt having sex. Keep in mind the times that would get steamy and I would try to initiate she would stop me and I would stop when I caught that hint. I‚Äôm not gonna force myself onto someone either that‚Äôs fuck shit and anyone who does that deserves to rot in hell.

After that relationship I started talking to another girl and long story short she strung me along so she would have a good image for her family. Fuck her too.

35,qh524e,1635364461,"I think my friend [F 19] might be into me[M 19], but I have a partner. What do I do?","To give context to the whole situation recently I have somehow managed to stumble my way into a relationship with this chick that I would consider a 9 looks and personality-wise. 

&amp;#x200B;

This occurred during my school break, and as such, my friend was away in Spain. She and my girl are aware of each other, and they seem to get along quite well.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently she just came back and became aware of the new relationship, and at first, she seemed happy about it. However, recently I've noticed that she has been a lot more intimate with me. She's getting close to me when we're sitting and she's a lot more touchy than she used to be.

&amp;#x200B;

So a couple of days ago, I asked her for some relationship advice given that most of the time I was with a girl it was always on some casual ""just smashing"" vibe. However just after she seemed to get kinda quiet and played a song whose lyrics amounted to ""I like you"". It's a phrase that's repeated in the song often. I'm a bit of a music buff in the sense that I notice what people play, and this is something she hasn't played ever before. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's an entirely different vibe.

&amp;#x200B;

So to conclude this post, I'm wondering if she is into me, or am I looking too deep into it? If it helps, we've only really been friends for a couple of months.

Im 25M, she is 32F, Will summarize my situation

* 1st Meeting/Instant Date: Met her outside a bar, good conversation happened, we drank together, i tried to spice things up saying she has a kissable face, she replied that she goes further only if there is a romantic chemistry, kinda not into hookups, had good conversation later, she asked for my number, i gave her. we called it a night and went to our respective homes.
* 2nd date: she texted me she owes me a drink , sets a date on weekend, I was like 'Yeah, lets meet', she rescheduled to next week, i was like cool you let me know when things have settled a bit, she texts me again later to meet on next weekend, im happy, we met at a game arcade/bar, played some games, had a lot of awkward silence, but we also discussed about meeting for a next date.

After the 2nd date, i texted her she looked cute, she texts me back saying i look very handsome myself.

* 3rd date: I scheduled this date, it was cloudy and might rain, so there was a chance of rain, i picked her up, we drove around the city, walked around the river, eat at a restaurant, this time the conversation was good, no awkwardness, we discussed about meeting for next date. i drove her back, she asked me to come inside her home and wanted to teach me a board game, introduced me to her roommates, nice people. Me and her played the game, she looked sleepy/tired at 9pm(she sleeps early). i said we should call it a day, i left , she came to drop me till my car. asks me to text when i reach home. she was about to go, i hold her hand again and say that ""i really like spending time with you"" she replies ""Yea, same here xxx, you're a nice/great guy""

after the 3rd date i text her i reached home and liked spending time with her, she says the same and says she enjoys my company.

How do i escalate and establish a relationship with this woman,i dunno physical escalation, but we do hug everytime we meet and part after every date.

im scared that if i dont escalate things, i might turn this relationship into platonic instead of a romantic one, but i don't wanna come off as too strong. i have a feeling that she is really mature and knows the dating game really well, im a noob when it comes to dating.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in Florida. I have been trying to change the status quo, but everything seems simple. In some uncertain times, I became very bad.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

About me-I am an independent woman. I have a failed marriage and I always believe that people who like to gamble must not have a unique love. My predecessor was a gambler, and he lost everything in just a few months. I think this is very sad. What I want to accompany him now is a cold prison bed. So I dislike gambling. After the divorce, I moved to this legendary city. I have my own business and my own unique and clean friends. I usually like sports. Travel, golf, swimming, reading, food and shopping, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have no feelings in life, but to be honest, my recent work and life are a bit bad for me, so I am looking for someone. I am an optimist, but because I passed and let myself not relax, I want to change myself and hope to contact some friends. I live in St. Louis because I can‚Äôt meet my friends. I hope I can meet more friends in the United States or Canada. After the epidemic, we can eat something meaningful. I am 35 years old. I believe that many people will mature and experience this era. Due to my work, if I haven't recovered for a long time, please forgive me, it doesn't mean that I don't want to talk, it's just for me. Say that my job is everything to me at the moment. However, I will try my best to maintain the dialogue.

68,qh8k9k,1635374399,Rejected and CONFUSED by my Gym Crush..,"Okay, don‚Äôt hate me but Idk if this is the right place to post this but I‚Äôm just wanting some advice.

Okay, so I‚Äôm in a different state for work, I‚Äôve been working out, working on myself, wasn‚Äôt going to the gym looking for a man or anything. For about 2.5 weeks there was this guy who I‚Äôd see about every morning at the gym since we both workout from 2:30a - 5a. I‚Äôd see him but I didn‚Äôt really care much until one day we made eye contact and he smiled. 
After that I started noticing him more and then every time he‚Äôd walk past me I‚Äôd look over at him and we‚Äôd smile. We eventually started saying hello or good morning!

So last Wednesday, we were leaving the gym, he held the door open for me, and I asked him his name, he told me his, I told him mine, and then he was like ‚Äúit‚Äôs nice to meet you.‚Äù

I went back home for the weekend/a SLIPKNOT concert lol and then came back to work on Monday. He was at the gym as usual. I‚Äôd also like to note that every time I go to the AB section he‚Äôd come in there a few mins later, we‚Äôd say hello and smile and that‚Äôs it. Id be too shy to say more and didn‚Äôt know if he was just shy too.

So Tuesday this week I was getting frustrated. I assumed he was interested but was too shy to say anything since I could be intimidating and hard to read like most people in the gym I guess. But I decided to just suck it up and as I was leaving so was he. Like I don‚Äôt know if we were just leaving at the same time or if he was making himself available for me to talk to him? But anyways I was like ‚Äúhey!‚Äù And he said hey and I asked him how he was, and he told me, then he asked how I was and I told him and we had a playful conversation and talked about what we did for work etc. so then I was just like ‚Äúwell I want to give you my number if you want it and want to text sometime.‚Äú And he was like ‚Äúyeah of course‚Äù he seemed shocked but enthusiastic. He seemed kind of nervous when trying to store my number pressing the wrong buttons because his phone is kind of old and not really calibrated very well but once I gave him my number he said he texted me but I never received the text so I was like well I can take your number since you‚Äôre having trouble and he was like ‚Äú yes that would be even better.‚Äù And then he gave me his number and I called it so he had mine and it rang on his phone so I know it was the right number. it seemed like a good conversation, seemed normal it wasn‚Äôt awkward and I said thank you and he said goodbye. It sounds awkward when typing it but I promise everything seemed very nice he was really easy to talk to you and I thought We left on a good note.

So 12 hours go by and he didn‚Äôt text me so I just decided to text him ‚Äúhi!‚Äù ‚Ä¶

No response.

At the gym this morning he wasn‚Äôt there. He‚Äôs been to the gym every single day Monday through Friday consistently up until We exchanged numbers‚Ä¶ still no response to the text either and now I‚Äôm wondering if he changed gyms just to avoid me‚Ä¶.

Idk know. I seriously did nothing wrong. I‚Äôm 28 and he‚Äôs 35 so that behavior is so weird coming from a grown man‚Ä¶ like why give me your number if you‚Äôre not interested? I‚Äôm not a baby so I can handle the truth upfront‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the lies or ghosting that hurts.. 

I don‚Äôt know how to feel at this point because I was working on my confidence and I have never approached a man in my life before. I‚Äôm used to them approaching me but I figured I‚Äôd just grab the situation by the horns this time.
But man, I‚Äôll tell you that men really know how to ruin a woman‚Äôs confidence. I‚Äôm trying to learn how to not internalize someone else‚Äôs behavior but this kind of hurt.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qh8k9k/rejected_and_confused_by_my_gym_crush/

He also wanted my parents to know about him and said that he wouldn‚Äôt have been wanting to meet my parents if he wasn‚Äôt planning on being serious.

81,qh9eof,1635377046,Should I dump my girlfriend or stay with her? Please help,"
Me (18m) and my girlfriend (20f) had a discussion last night about our relationship and our boundaries and I don‚Äôt know if I can trust her. We see each other everyday and really enjoy each other. We‚Äôve been dating for about a month and I‚Äôm catching red flags that I don‚Äôt know if I should ignore. Everything about her is great except my trust in her. I‚Äôm going to tell 100% of the truth about our feelings and what‚Äôs happened and I‚Äôm not going to be biased. I‚Äôm dating to marry not just to screw around. All I say is that you read everything.

Reasons why I like her/ am dating her:

1. She has high interest in me. She doesn‚Äôt act funny, she buys me gifts a lot, she texts back fast, she‚Äôs always eager to hang, always down for sex, she lists me on social media, and she genuinely cares about me. I never have to over pursue her and she pursues me a lot. She pays for dates sometimes and her gifts are really thoughtful. The relationship is 60/40 and she does most of the pursuing.

2. We have the same interests/ values . We‚Äôre both really fit and workout all the time, we both really love basketball, we‚Äôre both family oriented, she wants to be a house wife in marriage and I want to be a breadwinner, we listen to the same music and she‚Äôs really just the female version of myself.

3. We‚Äôre really affectionate/ connect well. We hang out everyday. We always cuddle, we have a good sex life having sex 3-5 times a week. She always kisses me, shows me affection in public, we play fight, can talk all day and get along well. She‚Äôs feisty and I love that. We just really connect well and always miss each other.

4. She‚Äôs good looking as hell.

5. Her family/ friends are cool and they respect me. They‚Äôve taken me out to eat, her mom and dad are so nice, they always insist to do stuff for me and are really respectful. I‚Äôve had long conversations with her parents. Her brothers are respectful and older than us.

Red flags:

1. She plays basketball with a lot of guys. I may seem insecure for this and I‚Äôve talked to her about this but she plays basketball in a gym with all guys and she‚Äôs the only girl. I‚Äôve played at her gym before and she had fun but the guys were kinda flirty (but not too flirty to where they were out of line). It seemed like they were more friendly than flirty. Normally a girl playing basketball with all guys is a deal breaker but this girl played in high school, keeps up with basketball, has tons of posters of players in her room and LIVES basketball. She always talks about basketball and loves the sport, we went to an NBA game and she knows and likes basketball more than a lot of girls I‚Äôve seen.

2. She has a lot of drama. She‚Äôs afraid to take me to a party because guys will get jealous and be messy. A guy has game to her house with a gun because he was jealous of our relationship but luckily she has 3 older brothers who told that guy off. She posted a tiktok of us and I saw a few guys commenting about our relationship and I told we her I didn‚Äôt like that and she said she blocked the guys she used to talk to before me but idk if it‚Äôs true. When we were at the gym she told me she saw a guy she used to talk to there and he disliked her because she left him and alot of other guys she was dating for me.

3. She‚Äôs told me about how she‚Äôs been done wrong in the past and how‚Äôs she‚Äôs done guys wrong in the past. She told me how she‚Äôs cheated by twerking on another dude at a party. How are ex cheated on her and she cheated on him back with his friend. She sounded like she regretted it and she told me she‚Äôs changed but that stuff happened when she was in high school. She‚Äôs told me a lot that she‚Äôs afraid that I‚Äôll cheat and that she‚Äôs dropped all the guys she was dating for me. I want to check her phone but I don‚Äôt at the same time because it‚Äôs kinda immature.

4 her tiktoks are kinda sexual. She doesn‚Äôt exploit her body which I‚Äôm happy about but somethings she says kinda catches my attention. Some were goofy but some talked about sex and ‚Äúsneaky links‚Äù. She said her body count is 5 including me but I hope she‚Äôs telling the truth.

*special notes

We both came to agreement that we don‚Äôt fully trust each other.

We‚Äôre on good terms and aren‚Äôt mad at each other about this. Our talk last night made me feel more comfortable with her but I wanted to ask about this on Reddit to fully make sure.

It takes a lot of self-searching (and self-doubting), but when you get to that point when you're comfortable in your own skin and try to become a better, healthier person, you'll start seeing how people feel more comfortable around you.

Every time I have asked her to come to my house there has always been an excuse. She has been to my house maybe three times this year. Over the year and a half of my boyfriend and I being together he has noticed and heard many times about how she has brought me down. I love them both dearly but recently I asked her to come over with her boyfriend to celebrate Halloween. This is the first year I am living in a neighborhood that does trick or treating and I am so excited. To what i thought would be a simple yes or no answer became two days worth of nothing but drama. I kept bringing it up to her and she kept telling me to tell my boyfriend to invite her boyfriend. She was scared that her boyfriend would immediately shut the thought down and thought that if my boyfriend asked him he would at least think about it. I thought this idea was just outright dumb but I went with it. Since then her and her boyfriend have been talking poorly about my boyfriend and I‚Äôs relationship and she has been openly sharing these conversations with me over the phone. I do not talk bad about my boyfriend to her and obviously expect the same of her‚Ä¶ This has been about two days now of hearing their thoughts on whether we will actually get married, what he doesn‚Äôt do for me, etc. Basically down talking him to me for two days now.

Fourth day she wanted to pay for food. üíØ I paid for 3 days, Hotel, food and etc. I said no I will pay for it. She said no I have to tell you something you don't know about me. She said she is married and she wants me for daytimes. For the next meeting she will pay all things.
I said I'm sorry I can't do that. You are married. I feel bad.
This happened to me second time. 6 month ago I met lady she didn't tell me that she is married in our second date.

93,qhahtr,1635380507,Is it common for women to bail out last minute on a planned date?,"This happened to me (M24) a couple of times recently with women (F20-25) on Bumble. We talk for a bit, I ask if they want to go on a date, they say us (enthusiastic tone), and we plan a specific day/time/place. But moments before the date (&lt; 30 min), they either ghost or say that something came up...

I'm not going to pressure someone to go on a date if they're not feeling it, so I support their decision kindly if they respond and move forward with my own life. But it does feel pretty crappy on the receiving end, especially if I was really looking forward to getting to know the person. Is there a reason why this is done? I suspect some men do the same too.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qhahtr/is_it_common_for_women_to_bail_out_last_minute_on/

99,qhaweq,1635381822,I got a problem and a desire,"So I just moved here to Jacksonville and I don‚Äôt know where to go to find people, but more importantly I‚Äôm kind of jealous‚Ä¶ I see so many posts from so many users of them having casual relationships and hookups, or the fun that they have in parties etc and I‚Äôm like I want that! 
 But, what makes me jealous the most is just how many people know when a woman just wants a hookup or a fwb, to clarify, I‚Äôm not an ugly dude, ive been complemented several times by women and have had some approach me and try and flirt with me as well as dudes saying I‚Äôm above average or better looking than most men. But for some reason, even though the dating can be easy the hookups aren‚Äôt, I NEVER know when a girl just only wants sex, ive always been the type that flirts respectfully but then escalates it successfully too, but I can‚Äôt for the life of me deduce when a girl just wants sex.
Tl:DR I‚Äôm jealous of other peoples ability to read others more easily and I‚Äôm new to a place and I don‚Äôt have many friends or activities to go to",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qhaweq/i_got_a_problem_and_a_desire/
