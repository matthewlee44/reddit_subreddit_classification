2,occ1xt,1625238549,NEVER THOUGHT I would miss the dating scene in nyc....,"We all know nyc dating scene is horrible if not the worst for female.

I recently relocated to west European capital city and I realise most of the men can not carry on a decent conversation on these apps.

Examples:

1.One guy asked me if I want to stay here for long term, I made some light jokes and said maybe, to keep it light.
This was literally less than 10 sentences of our initial contact.
Then he said I should look up the pension plan or something if I want to stay for long term.
I casually joked he is a smooth talker then he replied:
Your pictures are good but your conversation is not there.

2.
I had few guys where after they asked my number on WhatsApp; then after exchanging hi texts they will completely go missing. I don‚Äôt understand the point asking my number if you have no intention to keep on texting me.


These two are just a few examples, in nyc I never occured things like that, most of my matches were funny responsive and could carry on normal conversation.

I personally do not find it flattering but kind of condescending. I find the emphasis on women's looks to be somewhat demeaning. 

To the random guys on the internet pursuing women, I would suggest that you please call women by their name and get to know more about interests, hobbies, accomplishments, hopes and dreams before you start with the cutsie nicknames. I, for one, want to know that I'm more than just a piece of eye candy to you.

I don‚Äôt disagree with any of them to be totally honest and have definitely pushed on myself over the years to help with my loneliness. But ever since this past January when I met and started dating my current girlfriend, I have realized that I‚Äôm just happier being in a relationship than I am single. 

On weekends, I‚Äôd look for plans with friends, try to go to the bars, go down to the beach with family but it was always the same.. I wished I had someone to share my life with. I always wanted someone to try new restaurants with, go to the beach with, make memories with. I still did those things with friends and family, but it never quite hit the spot of doing it with a significant other. 

My confidence is up because my girlfriend compliments me, supports me when I have bad days, pushes me to better myself and now tells me she loves me whenever she can. These things just simply do not exist in the same way when you‚Äôre single. 

I know it‚Äôs not pretty, but the truth of the matter is that I‚Äôm simply happier having someone in my life than not, especially as the older I get (28M).

11,ocd2oh,1625241534,I‚Äôve been to just about a dozen dates and every one of them ended up in me getting ghosted immediately. And I have no idea what ever went wrong?,"I just don‚Äôt understand at all. I've been using apps like CMB and Tinder for some time since I don't have as much opportunities to meet new people irl. I‚Äôm quite lucky to at least have the appearance and a solid bio to be able to get matches on dating apps. But after the texting stage and moving onto the meetup stage, that‚Äôs where every single connection I‚Äôve ever had ends.

In every date I went to, I made sure to put my best self forward, and try to make convo. I‚Äôm not the most extroverted but I try my best to be sociable, open and light-hearted. Many of the dates even seemed to go smoothly, with no awkward silences or anything in between. But once we part ways, that's when everything ends. Some of them were thankfully polite enough to at least tell me why I was rejected (albeit they usually made up a more politically correct reason like ‚Äòit‚Äôs not your fault it‚Äôs me‚Äô so that prevented me from ever knowing the true reason). The rest just ghosted me straight up or would give a blank obvious one-word text reply after a few long days to show their disinterest.

It sucks not because I keep getting rejected. It sucks because I don‚Äôt ever know what went wrong and I can‚Äôt improve or correct any potential flaws in myself because of it. I do know some possible reasons. One person seemed to reject me because they ended up being taller. Another one rejected me because they thought I was a working adult even though I clearly stated being as tudent. But these are just two cases. I have no idea what went wrong for the rest where these reasons were not valid. Just for the record I never lied or catfished or fake edit my pictures.

All in all, this honestly feels worst than getting rejected from a job interview. Or failing in an application to a top school. I could take the rejections at first. But what I can‚Äôt take is not knowing why I got rejected. After over a dozen rejections where I have absolutely‚Ä¶ zero‚Ä¶ complete idea what even went wrong, it‚Äôs does start to push me off the edge. I mean, even if the other party doesn‚Äôt feel the first date went up to expectations, isn‚Äôt it too early to judge by just one meetup? For every single one of them to choose to end it after the first date makes me wonder if I just screwed up that immensely bad.

I can‚Äôt help but feel so miserable at this point I don‚Äôt even feel miserable anymore. I've given up on life pretty much.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ocd2oh/ive_been_to_just_about_a_dozen_dates_and_every/

I'm 17, and have never talked to a girl via text except for my female classmates, and I usually don't even want to text/flirt with random girls. However, a couple days ago, I saw a girl's Insta story, and was very, um, blown away. She looked just my type, and really pretty. So, after checking her socials for a bit, I realized that she's about 1-2 years older than me, and is a friend of one of my seniors.

After debating for a few days, I decided to finally text her, but couldn't think of anything to start the conversation with (we both never knew each other); also, I fear that I'll just run out of topics to talk about and make everything awkward, since I'm a very bad texter.

I'm afraid that if even if I do text her, she'll just not be interested since I'm younger, or she'll tell my senior and he'll make things very awkward for me.

TLDR: Don't know how to start texting a girl a few years older than me.

I had told myself I was going to take it slow and see how things unfolded, I had a good feeling about it because the intentions seemed pure. 

We had discussed our previous relationships, he had mentioned he had gotten out of a long term (7 years) relationship within the last year. They were living together, she broke up with him, he lost his job due to COVID, he moved back home (aka where I‚Äôm from) when this was first mentioned he said he had moved on from it so I didn‚Äôt think much of it. I mentioned my last relationship of 5+ years and how I‚Äôve been single for almost 2 years and I‚Äôve done the healing work to be fully at a place where I‚Äôm ready to let someone in again. He told me I was someone he could see himself dating that we just needed to get to know each other more which I agreed. 

Mid May he mentioned he had to go pick up items that were at his old place because the girl was moving out. I was okay with that since it was fairly new I felt he didn‚Äôt owe me an explanation. He said that they were cordial but that he didn‚Äôt really feel anything anymore it was more of a weird situation.


This month he went to go pick up the bigger items, I hadn‚Äôt really heard from him so initially I asked what was going on, and that I needed to know where he stood because the hot and cold game wasn‚Äôt working for me. 

He then mentions that it‚Äôs been an emotional week for him and picking up his stuff kind of took him back and made him realize that he has not moved on from his last relationship and isn‚Äôt ready to give someone else the 100%. He mentioned that he thought he was ready that‚Äôs why he saw interest in me but said it‚Äôs just bad timing. 

It is such a hard pull to swallow but I appreciate the honesty and better that I know now then later. I just feel so bummed in a way that in every other way, we were compatible but I can‚Äôt force someone that isn‚Äôt emotionally ready. 

Could be bad timing or just another failed attempt, who knows but I know I have done the work in my healing and I deserve someone that can give me the 100%. I‚Äôm one of the people that believes in fate so if it‚Äôs meant to happen it will.

25,ocetei,1625246654,Sooo‚Ä¶met an ex last weekend and now no idea what‚Äôs going on‚Ä¶,"When I was 28, I met a 22 year old marine.  We had amazing chemistry and spent about 8 weekends in my apartment without leaving.  I fell completely in love with him and stuck around for his deployment only to have him leave me at the end of it.  He ended up getting married to a girl from his hometown a couple months later (she wasn‚Äôt in the picture until he got home - and yes, I know this for a fact).

I always felt that he loved me and left because he was scared of the whole situation‚Ä¶i was a 28 year old attorney and he was a lance corporal in the marine corps‚Ä¶he told me often I was ‚Äúterrifying.‚Äù

15 years go by and he‚Äôs always been the one that got away.  I messaged him on FB a few years ago and got no response.  A month ago, he messaged back and it was clear that the chemistry was all still there.  

We met up in Denver last weekend and it was, of course, amazing.  I got some answers.  He admitted he did love me but he knew he couldn‚Äôt sustain a real marriage and he thought he was going to die on his second deployment so he left me and just decided to ‚Äúlive it up‚Äù a little by marrying this random girl.  He said it wasn‚Äôt meant to last and lasted way longer than it should have.  He also implies strongly that he did think about proposing to me.

At one point I asked why he did it if he loved me and he said ‚Äúwould you rather it have been you and we‚Äôd gotten divorced?  Because that‚Äôs what would‚Äôve happened.‚Äù I said ‚Äúno this is probably better‚Ä¶.‚Äù and he said ‚ÄúI have to think about my daughter and you have stuff you need to figure out‚Äù and I said ‚ÄúI know but it sucks‚Äù

Then he said ‚Äúwe will figure it out.‚Äù

After I got home we talked a little.  I know he‚Äôs scared I want more (and I do but I‚Äôm not pushing for anything right now but I don‚Äôt think he understands that‚Ä¶.I just want to keep in touch and maybe see him now and then - I live in CA and he‚Äôs in CO so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm down the street).

Things seemed okay until he said ‚ÄúI hope you weren‚Äôt disappointed‚Äù and I said ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs safe to say I was far from disappointed. I‚Äôm the one hoping YOU weren‚Äôt.‚Äù  This was a comment about the fact that I‚Äôm 43 and my current on/off BF says I‚Äôm old, I‚Äôm barely cute, etc.  so I‚Äôm sensitive to how I look (and btw I do know I‚Äôm very attractive but having someone put you down for a year takes a toll).

The ex made me feel wanted again and I‚Äôm super grateful for that but that‚Äôs what I meant when I said that.

He stopped responding and hasn‚Äôt texted in 3 days.  I sent him a joke text this morning about my shoe getting broken (because we always said things were going to break when we met up - sure enough, my shoe broke lol).

So now I‚Äôm waiting.  Everyone I‚Äôve talked to has said my comment wasn‚Äôt weird or too much so what the heck is going on here?

I kind of feel like he does still have feelings for me and he‚Äôs scared again - this time because he doesn‚Äôt want a relationship because of his daughter.

What do I do here? Explain what I meant?  Just give him space and see if he comes back?  I‚Äô‚Äôm hoping my joke text will put him at ease because I‚Äôm acting normal and not clingy‚Ä¶just kinda trying to be cute.

She's demisexual and I haven't dated anyone demi before so I was trying to be respectful but today I had to ask her what was going on. 

She basically said it takes months for her to get used to people before she finds communication easy and thinks its 'absurd' that I am complaining about her pitiful attempt and 'getting to know me' 

But I don't understand, how can you get to know someone if texting you is akin to flogging a dead horse? She'd rearranged two meet ups, and wouldn't meet on a weekend, but somehow I'm an asshole for needing to know if she's actually interested. Was I supposed to deal with this shit for months with no positive encouragement. Does she really expect anyone with a shred of dignity to wait around for scraps?

46,ochrkx,1625255062,How to tell him that I need more words of affirmation and physical touch?,"My BF and I started seeing each other in December of last year (37f, 37m). He's met my friends, they like him. I've met some of his family, they like me. Things are good.

Except ... I recently moved to a city about 1.5 hours away from him and we're struggling to find our communication rhythm. 

So I'm missing physical touch due to the distance. AND, his 5yo son is visiting from California for the summer. We both agree that I won't meet his son this early on. So while we usually see each other at least 2 weekends a month, I won't see him until mid-Aug. It's for a good reason, but I still miss that physical closeness.

As for the words of affirmation tho, he's always been a man of few texts. It never bothered me because we have great conversation face to face. But now the words of affirmation aren't really there for me right now either. This weekend he's out on the lake w zero cell service so I won't hear from him until next week.

These two things together are making me feel super disconnected and insecure. I want to find a way to verbalize these things to him so we can try and find a rhythm that works for both of us.

50,oci23i,1625255895,Am I too jealous?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 months now. The thing is that before we got together as a couple, he was seeing two other girls. He didn't have a relationship with them, and they knew that - they were sort of ""buddy fucks"". So to say, they ""accepted"" his terms"". But when we got together, I told him that I would like to be the only one, and he said he accepted it.

One of the girls he was seeing, let's call her Marcella, was the last one he ""broke up"" with. He said that, since he had been with me, she noticed he was treating her differently, and that she proposed to call him and solve things out. As far as I know, they talked about it and she got furious, saying that he used her and etc. They said they wouln't see each other anymore, but he didn't tell her he was with me. At first, that didn't bother me, because I knew they weren't talking anymore. Now, it does. And a lot.

On his birthday (about 1 month ago), she sent him a message on Whatsapp and I saw it. She was saying happy birthday to him and saying that she'd never forget him, and then asked if there would be a party in his house. He said no, and that he was working. (Yes, I stalked his phone...)  
That got me very mad because I just think that he should have been honest with her and told her that he's with me now...

As I went through their messages, I didn't find anything suggestive. What I did find was that she mentioned she would go for a bike ride with a female friend, and he asked her if he could come the next time.

I talked to him about it the last time we saw each other. He said that there's no reason for me to be jealous because nothing would happen. I asked him why he didn't tell her he was with me - he said that he didn't have the chance, and the next time she asks him about it, he'll tell her. I didn't buy it, because it was the same thing my ex told me before cheating on me with a friend of his.

I said that I wouldn't feel comfortable with him going out with her alone, and he brought the bike ride up. He said: ""even if there's another friend with her?"". I said it was okay if they weren't alone, but I lied, of course, because I don't feel comfortable with the idea of him seeing her at all.

Before we even met, he had promised Marcella he would take her to the beach when she finished her thesis (she's doing a master's degree). I asked him if he would still go - he said he didn't know, and that if he did, it was only to keep his promise. I said I didn't like the idea and that if he were on my shoes, he wouldn't like it too. He said that he wouldn't go then. I asked him if I was being mean, and he said he didn't think so, but that I was setting hard rules. He also asked me if I wanted to go with them to the beach, and I said it'd be just ridiculous.

Even though he tells me nothing will/would happen, I don't know if I trust him. I feel bad that I look through his phone, that I see his texts, but I also don't understand why he hasn't told her he's with me... I think she still likes him, and even though he says that he wouldn't be with her, I just feel more and more jealous.

I'm even feeling paranoid. Every time he doesn't answer me, I think he's with her. When he's online and taking his time to answer me, I start to make assumptions that he's talking to her.

He also said: ""I'm with you. If I wanted to be with her, I would have been with her. There's no reason to be so paranoid"". But I don't know... I feel betrayed just by the fact that he didn't tell her about me from the first place.

69,ocldik,1625265759,Should I confront a guy who obviously lied about his height?,"Bumble date with a guy whose profile said 5'8"" went very well the other night: smart, good politics, very cute. And it's not my first rodeo, so I fully expected 5'8"" to be 5'6"" (and to be disappointed about that). But I believe (based on me eyeballing him) that he was the same height as me - 5'3 (or \*maybe\* 5'4'""). Again, I thought he was attractive, and I have dated short guys in the past, so this is less about the height and more about the lying. 

Dude, your lie was blatant: you took yourself out of the ""short guy"" range and put yourself in the ""average"" range. The fact that you didn't show up on stilts or with lifts means you're either gaslighting me, or think it's not noticeable, or expect me to sign on eagerly to your bluff. But I'm not trying to do that. 

I am aware that guys think they'll get more dates if they aren't short. Well, I'd get more dates if I wasn't 40, but I don't LIE about that on my dating profiles!

Options are to (a) not see him again, (b) see him again and just let it go, or (c) bring it up if our 2nd date goes well. If I opt for (c), what's a way to say it??",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ocldik/should_i_confront_a_guy_who_obviously_lied_about/

I'm in a long distance relationship with this guy &amp; sometimes I'll see him on his friends Instagram stories, or he'll tell me about something fun he did with them and I get jealous. 
I'm jealous of the time he spends with them that he can't spend with me. I'm also jealous because a lot of the time when he's actually with me he doesn't WANT to do fun things.... he always says he's tired and we end up laying in bed all day or running errands. 

A big part of the problem is i am an extrovert who currently has no friends. Not because I suck lol, I just moved to a place where I don't really know anyone and then there was a pandemic and my job doesn't have opportunity for friendship building so I feel super stuck. I'm kind of lonely and wish he would invite me to hang with his friends when I'm at his place but he never does. I don't think he wants his friends to meet me... :(

It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I expect every date to cancel on me.

I‚Äôve done a lot of inward reflection and I can‚Äôt identify what I might be doing wrong, if anything. I recently moved to a city which, as I understand it, is notorious for flakey people who usually only wish to engage on a surface level‚Äîbut I really didn‚Äôt expect this sort of behavior.

The weird part is that the people who cancel on me have no issue giving me their numbers or Instagram accounts prior to cancelling, so it‚Äôs not a matter of comfortability as far as I can tell...it‚Äôs just a complete lack of follow-through.

The weight of being continually cancelled on is driving me nuts and causing me to feel depressed. It‚Äôs extremely hard not to identify myself as the common factor (and therefore a problem) and feel like a piece of shit. Is this happening to anyone else?

I really like this girl but worry about coming on too strong. After the second time seeing her I kind of stopped texting her except to make new plans (i.e. after I slept over last night I just texted her tonight that I had fun, wanted to see her on Monday since I'm away for the weekend and she reciprocated). She doesn't really text me much either. However, we both get really cuddly after sex, looking into each others eyes, playing with her hair, giving back rubs and shit like that, and we always end up accidentally waking up super early the morning after and just talking/cuddling until one of us has to go to work instead of going back to sleep.

I'm worried I'm sending mixed signals by not texting much and not taking her out on real dates (although people our age/in our social circles are very casual and she once mentioned she kinda hated dating, not relationships, just that annoying phase where you keep having to be formal and taking each other out) but also being very intimate/romantic with her in private.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ocm1xk/am_i_sending_mixed_signalswhat_message_am_i/

So I just had a date with a match on Hinge, and I thought it went well. She was busy and I was fine with that, I was optimistic we'd have a second date. A few days pass and she gets back to me explaining, as I thought, that she's been busy with the moving. Cool. Nothing until the following day when she responds and informs me that she is now exclusive with somebody else. Great... 

While I'm bummed about this outcome I've come to accept that women usually have a few guys they might be dating. While I can't blame her for seeing her options, it really irks me how I can never know who else these women are seeing at the same time. The system is pretty much set up for women to be pursued by as many thirsty guys as come across them. It's just a bit depressing knowing there's a fairly good chance you're already being compared to the first second or Nth person they've seen in the past week. Getting the first opportunity seems like a strong position to find one's self in, but the odds don't work out.

So I'm left with a  unpleasant  feeling in my  gut  even though I thought her being straight up and honest about the whole situation was very nice. Still doesn't make it any easier.

I hit her up to hang out the next week, to go see a movie at this nice outdoor movie theater that I know she's into. It ended up raining so she just invited me over to hers to watch a movie (I have roommates and she doesn't) and we had sex.

She ends up cancelling on me right before the date, saying an emergency with her moving came up (she actually is moving, so it might have been legit). Next morning she texts me saying she was really sorry about flaking, she really likes hanging out with me and she doesn't want me to hate her (weird wording). Thinking that possibly she was turned off by me wanting to go on another legit date rather than just come over and fuck. I asked if I could come over just to watch a movie the next day then, and she said yes, and I did.

A bunch of things are weighing on me thinking she doesn't have feelings and kind of wants to stay a fuckbuddy, but I'm overthinking it probably, especially because of the text she sent me after she flaked on our date:

1. Both times after the first date that I proposed a proper date, she either said ""just come over to mine instead"" (it was raining and it was an outdoor theatre, so fair...) or she flaked (but might actually have had a moving emergency)
