If I'm being honest, I put everything on the back burner. I've finally got a lull this summer, so I can finally unwind after nearly 6 years of continuous stress. So I'm playing catch-up now.

I've tried out dating apps, but given their intended to make money rather than be a transparent and useful service, it's been a bit of a time waste.

7,n0vqll,1619666524,"I'm trans, queer, neurodivergent, and about to give up on dating.","I just don't fit into the dating scene for queer women (and women-adjacent folks). I don't smoke pot (and don't want to be around people who do), I'm not polyamorous, I'm more focused on my career and hobbies than ""adventures"" (whatever that means), I have very few friends, I don't pick up on social cues easily, and I struggle to pass. My pool of potential dates is extremely low because the vast majority of cis people would never date a trans person, and being queer makes it even smaller. I get almost no matches on dating apps. To be clear, I'm not saying cis people should feel obligated to date us, but I do *wish* they would give us a chance.

I broke up with my girlfriend (my second serious romantic relationship ever and the first since I came out as trans) last November, and her other partner has already moved in with her. We're trying to stay friends, but it's humiliating as fuck to have to be the third wheel. With one notable exception that I'll get into in a moment, every time I schedule a first date with someone new, they cancel and ghost. I even got told by someone that I should give up on dating altogether and try to be friends first. Like hell that's going to work for me.

I've had two dates with a really sweet guy, which says a lot since I'm mostly into women. But when we went back to his apartment, all he wanted to do was cuddle (and make out a little). I left feeling disappointed, especially since I know he has another partner already. I want to take things to the next level, but I'm afraid that he'll get weirded out and cut off all contact with me if he doesn't want the same thing. So now it's like I'm stuck in limbo.

I don't know what to do. I've been told that I'm ""brave"" for living my truth and trying to date as my authentic self. I don't want to be brave. I just want to be loved and accepted.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n0vqll/im_trans_queer_neurodivergent_and_about_to_give/

So I told him I'm trying to move on no matter that I still like him and miss him a lot. Because we can't promise when we'll be able to meet and it makes me helpless and saddened (Due to covid it's currently impossible to visit each other)
Anyways he replied in a long text saying 

‘Okay I understand, I was messaging because I missed you but I get that would make you unhappy. I want you to be happy and healthy! Go date some nice boys or girls that are not old aged and then whenever you think we could wander into each other again send me a message okay. I have grown to care about you and would like to know how you're doing from time to time, but I'll stop messaging you. Take care ❤️’

But I was confused by the ‘I have grown to care about you’ part. is that common to say something like that to a girl who he has been dating? cus I thought his feeling was deeper than just ‘have grown care’.
Now I feel like a total dumb who has assumed this as a deeper thing for a long time by myself.

11,n0w788,1619668251,I (28M) feel kinda doomed.,"I’ve gone on 120+ dates in the past two years. Out of those dates I’ve had very many ONS’s, a bunch of casual relationships, and nothing serious. There have been a handful of girls who wanted something more and I couldn’t offer it to them at the time because they weren’t right for me. If I ever wanted more, they weren’t interested. I’ve been stood up, ghosted, whatever as well. My self-esteem has taken plenty of blows. 

I’ve found that anyone I’m actually interested in does not end up developing feelings—they tell me “you’re a fantastic guy but...”—whereas many of the people I don’t want much to do with end up falling for me. It feels like an actual curse. I have enough trouble getting dates with people I find attractive, but maintaining any kind of meaningful connection or relationship with them seems impossible. I’m so fucking tired of dating apps that swiping feels like a chore, let alone actually coming up with conversation. It’s the only way I meet people and I don’t know any other viable routes right now.

A few weeks ago, a girl I went on four dates with vanished the day after we spent the night together laughing and hooking up. Just ghosted. Yesterday a gorgeous girl I went on a few dates with said I’m an amazing guy but there wasn’t the spark she’s looking for. I thought I felt electricity when we kissed but I guess I was wrong. I legit asked her if I could improve in any way and she effusively said no, I’m terrific and the dates were perfect. I’ve been deeply depressed since then. I don’t even know what I’m doing wrong.

13,n0wbsc,1619668746,My ex reached out to me after 4 years. What does she want? (Update),"I'm a 23 year old guy, and my ex is 21 year old girl.

Some backstory:

My ex and I grew up in the same neighborhood and she was super good friends with my family. I could tell she started to like me around my junior year, but I wasn't super interested in dating because I was going through a lot at the time. Eventually I started to catch feelings for her, we became best friends, and then we dated for about 2-2.5 years in highschool and a little bit when I went to college. 

She broke up with me after my first semester in college because she felt like she would miss out on a lot when she went to college if she was still dating me. I wanted to marry her, so it took me by surprise. It took me a long time to get over it, but I eventually did and lived my own college life too. Looking back on it now, it would've been a shitty marriage if we had gone through with it that young. I understand that now, but it was tough at the time!

I've stayed single since then because I just haven't found someone that compliments my life, and that's okay too. Being single has been a blast, but I definitely want to find someone one day. My ex asked if we could meet up about a year and half after the breakup so she could return the ring I gave her and some other stuff that she felt she couldn't hold onto anymore, and I felt like we left everything on good terms. 

My ex ended up marrying someone soon after and we never really spoke again for obvious reasons. She stayed really good friends with my brother and his wife so I heard about pretty much anything major that happened with her. 

About 3.5 weeks ago, I get a call from her. We joked around for a while and it was like nothing had changed. She told me she had divorced about a year ago. She told me that she's in town and asked if I would meet her to go on a walk and talk. We did that night, she apologized for the way she treated me, I got a bunch of stuff off of my chest too, we talked about what was going on in each other's lives, and I had a lot of fun with her. 

At the end of the night, she tells me that she still thinks that we are soulmates, or meant to be together. She tells me that she may still have a little crush on me, but that it's harmless because we don't know each other anymore. We have both changed a lot and it wouldn't be smart to just jump back into something like that, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't excited when she told me.

Anyways, we've been talking since then. We've both been a little flirty with each other. I got some hope of a possible future relationship when she told me that she doesn't want to get in a relationship with anyone until a year after her divorce for her own healing purposes. I think that's good for her! But I was honest with her and told her I'd be interested in seeing what could happen in the future. 

She knows I'm interested. So what does she do?

She brings up dates she goes on with other guys when she knows that I'd love to take her out, she sends me cute selfies because she knows it'll keep me coming back, and she has been judgemental of where I'm at in my life right now. I'm living at home, working a part time job, and trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. I stopped college after my associates because I didn't know what I wanted to do beyond that and wasn't willing to go into debt. She says that my mom has me by the balls if I'm living at home, and I could be doing a lot more than just a part time job, and BLAH BLAH. I'm sure I could be doing more, but we are all in different stages of our life and I don't give af where she's at in her's. This stuff really bothers me, but then she says something that gives me hope again, and it's been like that ever since we started talking again.

I guess that I am not really sure what she wants, but it feels like she's just keeping me open as an option. I wouldn't be hurt if nothing happened between us in the future. Maybe it shouldn't at all. I don't mind being a good friend to her and being there if she needs. I think she is pretty fresh off of her divorce and wants to date around and have fun. I get it, but I don't like games or whatever tf this is. 

I have a soft spot for her because of our history. I was on a high when she spoke to me for the first time after 4 years, but I'm starting to come down from things and see a little more clearly.

So...

What do you think she wants? Do you think she just needs a friend or wants more? I'll be friends with her and be a gentlemen and be there if she needs anything, but should I pursue anything beyond that? Or should I just straight up ditch the whole situation?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n0wbsc/my_ex_reached_out_to_me_after_4_years_what_does/

15,n0wdzi,1619668970,I invited my LDR on a trip in her country and declined,"First, I write this because I want to vent, and second, I need your advice.

I’m a male, from Argentina. I’ve been to the states before and so to many other countries. I have my LDR who lives in America. For reasons that have to do with college and covid, I decided to plan on going to America in July. 
You see, July is summer there and schools / colleges are for the most part closed, this applies to her. However, she is studying to become an actor and signed up for a production in July this year. I admit I told her my plans too late for that, but it was as soon as I could. 

The problem with this is that she says she “can’t” come with me and join me in the trip because of her “obligation” to the production she signed in. 

For a point of view, I understand it’s an obligation. But from another point of view, I see this as a backstabbing. I try on going to her country and inviting her to know it together (she would have to pay $0), I feel she could perfectly call her productor and tell her she just can’t go because of the extraordinary reasons. Nonetheless, she doesn’t agree with me, she keeps insisting that she can’t because it’s her “obligation”.

I think she would have a thousand productions in her lifetime yet she has this one unique chance that probably would never come again in this shape and she declines it. I honestly feel like a fool. I am trying to do everything to get there, from the difficulties of traveling because of the pandemic to the money to pay for it while she just declines it. 

I feel like this is a GIANT redflag. 

I try not to be intense with my feelings but I’m a passionate person of Italian background so you can already imagine.

34,n0y9j9,1619677037,Need Advice for Future Relationships. GO AWAY ATTACHMENT AND CONFIDENCE ISSUES!!,"Also, a warning the context may seem too cutesy or too rehearsed, and that’s because it’s been in my head over and over for 3 months sadly. So to kinda give context here, I’m a 19 year old male, who had been living in dorms alone for 2 semesters (8 months), working hard to get into mechanical engineering 2nd year. Around the beginning of the second semester, I felt secure enough in my own skin and personal health that I felt that it would be good to get into dating. I met a few women in real life and dating apps who showed interest in me. So for about a month of the second semester I spent dating and talking to these girls on FaceTime and casual walks on the local beach, most went well, but not many would progress past the first 2 dates. Since most of them either felt like duds or just left me on read after 2 weeks, i turnt to the final girl (yes I had a list or hierarchy but it was unintentional). I had only been talking to her about sci-fi and various topics regarding our heritage over time, conversations over text never felt dry, but they weren’t too frequent. 
One day I said “fuck it, FaceTime her”. so I asked, and I received, we ended up calling from 6 pm to 10 am. It was an immediate spark. Went from blade runner to “the great filter” theory, to Spanish loyalty. I took a test right after, sleep deprived and continued my day. This established a pattern of calls and frequent texts back and forth for the next week, though calls were much shorter, the feeling was the same. Nearing the end of the week she asked me on a date. I promptly said “yeah sure I’ll look at my schedule maybe I’ll be free”. Trying to be a “cool stud” with this beautiful lady. Yeah I had nothing planned for the next 2 weeks. We met at a pizza place, we ate and constantly talked from 5pm to closing time, we teased, laughed stared. Blah blah. After getting kicked out we walked the neighborhood, we had our first few kisses on a thin freshly snowed road. It was mutually agreed that we head to my place. We go there, do some stuff, she asks about my relationships, what I want in a relationship, and what would my future hold, basically everything implying that she wanted to have a future with me. 
I knew she got out of a breakup before this, but I didn’t know how soon and how long they were together.(I assumed it was a 4 month fling with 2 month separation between me and him). As she left I felt something was wrong, yeah sure a real caring human who I’ve been ~kinda talking to for 1 month and really talking to for a week and a half, just left. Of course it’s some feelings of me missing her, but the days followed after that she ghosted me or she would get short with me or just be slower to start talking to me. Like okay yeah I can get clingy and I probably did get quite attached after that night, it would be hard not to. 
It was later revealed that she “just got out of the breakup” and “felt shitty because, he was the first person she ever truely loved”. “Oh fuck yeah” I thought, “a classic for the ages, time to cry in the shower for 30 minutes and walk it off”. But as time ensued I wasn’t able to let it go, I slowly started to distance myself from my friends and clinging onto my cousin and my sister for consolation and needing explanations of the whole thing. I started spiraling. (I started spiraling badly after she started leaving me on read but this was a real nail in the coffin). I could tell my family members were getting annoyed by me, not knowing red flags and how to control my depression. I knew she was just a fish in the sea, but as a guy devoid of any relationships that showed affection, this really got me going. 
I did the wrong thing and tried restarting it with the girl, it seemed to be going well but it she would not want to call or do anything more than casual texting. I know looking back at this that I was dumb as fuck for doing such a thing, I don’t need more criticism now. 
So I went into another spiral. Around this time I felt I had chlamydia from her so I started to make lies in my head about her to make myself feel better about being rejected. I got tested, all negatives. Again I was an asshole. More of these antics ensued until I just kind of gave up. 
I just started thinking, if I was someone dating a guy, and his reaction to this is this whole essay, then he’s one huge red flag. Too emotionally dependent, too clingy and makes up lies to make himself feel better about anything surrounding you. 
I was just awestruck at my shitty brain habits . So I went out with some more women to fill the hole she left, all seemed like god’s sign of “dude I lead these women here to show you that you have value outside of a random girl on tinder”
I just didn’t have it. So I moved back home with my family after being so depressed that I gained a solid 25 pounds in a few weeks and never had left my dorm ever. But yeah here I am now wondering if I should’ve sought therapy back then, or if I even should now. I still feel as if she was just a lucky coin flip. I went  on tinder and restart the process, I only got 2 likes and 4 matches in a week, and all of them left me on read. So I don’t know what happened. Sure different universities, different countries, different cultures, but my speech couldn’t have changed that much. 
So yeah I guess that’s where I am now. Trying to build myself into a physically and mentally chiseled work of art, but seemingly teetering on the edge of falling onto a depressive void. 

What should I do? seek therapy, get antidepressants, work on attachment, or even, what are are some tricks you learned in past Relationships that could help me to be less of a shipwreck in my future endeavors?

Thank you for reading by the way. If you got this far I truly appreciate you caring for me in this awful time of dating.

Although, he (28/M) didn't take it too well he still understood. It pains me to hurt anyone truly, a few years ago I didn't hesitate to block someone the moment I felt the need to.

I hope that I made the right choice because overall he was a decent guy. I feel that it's best for us both even though he feels differently. He does have some insecurities and I have my share of mental health complications that I need to overcome. Otherwise, it definitely wouldn't work out with anyone.

I do have a tendency to self sabotage and he said because of my own selfishness, it's the reason we're not developing.

She says yes but I cancel on her and say I had covid bc I was seeing this other girl at the time that I really liked. Cut to a month later I hit her up and ask her out randomly and she surprisingly still says yes.

We meet up, she’s sort of odd and weird, not I’m a good way but she was telling me how she doesn’t like all these people, all she does is work and school, and doesn’t have any hobbies, snd she seemed a tad self centered. It’s a first date so I’m not expecting anything but I like talking to people so we talked about her mom having cancer, feeling lonely, our futures, etc but we also joked around stuff snd drank wine by the beach. 

The date lasted like 4-5 hours and when I was dropping her off she was like “oh you’re not going to come in,” so I was like why not and we went into her apartment. She wants to do shots, we watch a movie, and next thing you know we’re making out and fucking. Also, it might be worth mentioning that I had like half a bottle of wine, 3 shots of vodka, and a white claw (all on an empty stomach) so I was drunk and maybe that affected my dick too. 

The sex was meh snd my dick kept going soft with a condom snd she clawed my dick with her acrylic nails a couple times while trying to jack me off (which really hurt) and I asked her to suck my dick and she didn’t know what she was doing. 

There were some good moments, looking back it was pretty hot, we were laying side by side making out, while I was fingering her wnd she was getting me off. I ate her out (it was my first time eating a girl out and second time having sex) and she moaned out a couple times when I found this triangle like thing lol, maybe it was her clit but idk.

Anyways, instinctually I’m a biter and I usually check in with the girl to make sure it’s. It too hard but I was drunk and got a little carried away snd sort of drew a cut on her boob. She was annoyed with that and idk it felt weird after and i offered to finish the movie after but she said that she needed to go to work tomorrow and so I just left and kissed her goodbye.

Honestly I felt empty for a little bit but I liked the validation, I just think I didn’t like her that much (even though she’s pretty cute) and it was the first date and it was the first time meeting this girl so I was just mentally unprepared to have sex. 

I message her after asking to hangout again just for shits and giggles, and she said that she would let me know in two weeks bc she’s going out of town (which she had told me about before). I don’t really care about her liking me but I’m just wondering if she didn’t enjoy the sex, even though I feel like I was more attentive to her than she was to me. 

I’m just sort of confused and this is the first time where a girl literally threw herself at me and I didn’t really feel a solid connection before I had sex with her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n0yed7/do_you_think_this_was_a_soft_no_or_is_casual/

Now, when I go on dates it’s like when a guy gives me a compliment it feels like a sham to me, like just a comment to get into my pants like before. When a guy wants an ACTUAL relationship after going out for a few times it’s like it doesn’t feel real so I pull away. 

How can I deal with this because I’m noticing that I don’t give guys a chance because I tell myself it’s not real at all. I push so many people away now and get SUPER defensive.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n0yj95/after_glowing_up_im_dealing_with_bitterness_from/

I am a virgin and haven't got a good social circle, most if not all being guys, and it's pretty toxic. The problem I see with my friend group I've been a part of since high school is that they all follow this one guy who's a selfish piece of shit who drags everyone around him down, and he always finds a way to crawl back up your ass no matter how hard you try get rid of him. I'm part of this group due to low self esteem, the rest of the guys are just sheep and cant think for themselves, and they all do drugs with him and illegal shit for him. Its kindof like a little gang. Also my high school was a all boys school, so I never learned how to talk to girls. 

When I was little I was bullied alot. Mostly by girls who I liked, so I've developed a fear of having crushes and asking women out due to early childhood experiences. It's actually affected my life alot, not being able to love myself enough and being scared of someone loving me. If I did manage to crush on someone I'd avoid them.

If they mean chemistry, compatibility, the fabled butterflies in the stomach, then it makes even less sense to me. You can only know if you are romantically compatible or have chemistry with someone if you do date them and take a risk exploring them in that light. 

When looking for women, I don't look for immediate chemistry, I look for potential of chemistry. Isn't this common practice?

48,n0zfgp,1619682439,Did I do the wrong thing in basically telling him to f*ck off?,"PS we're vaccinated - so that's not an issue. 

I met this guy on a dating app in early March. I've been hurt enough times in relationships that I try to keep my emotions pretty steady and don't let myself get too excited about anyone. But this guy slipped through the cracks, lol. We just clicked really well right off the bat.

We had one video date (March) and one real date (April). He made it clear that he wanted to see me again in April, but I had exams so I had to wait. This put some pressure on us to keep up the texting until then (and we all know how much that can suck). I think it meant the fire/bullshit ""excitement"" phase unfortunately started to wane. 

We were supposed to see each other this weekend. We agreed on that like a week ago. I was (too) excited - this was the first time I'd be seeing anyone in a while, I'm done with school, and it's with this guy I thought was really great! I had a dress picked out and everything.

Anyways, he texts me yesterday and says this weekend will be tough because some of his friends are graduating/ moving away and they're having parties he wants to go to. In the moment, I got pissed. I ignored his other unrelated texts and said ""Seriously??"" and then said ""It's totally fine I get it let me know when you're free"". He sent another text explaining/apologizing and I basically repeated my message. 

My friends all say I didn't overreact... it's important to me that my time is respected and that I'm not walked all over... but idk. That phrase from the internet, ""if he wanted to he would"", is in my head. If he wanted to see me, he would. He didn't even suggest rescheduling.

So two questions I guess: 
Did I overreact? And is this thing with him over? 

Thanks guys. 

**TLDR** Been talking to this guy for 2 months - 2 dates, would have been more but I had some school stuff in the way.

49,n0zfqd,1619682471,Perhaps my insecurity overpowered my logic in my brain?,"I constantly emphasize how my brain focuses on logic, data and facts, I’m very analytical (which is perhaps very dangerous when mixed with insecurity).

I grew up bullied a lot, my dad abused me too, drinking a lot, and the worst part is, at 25, I’m still affected by these things to the point I have not moved on and still live in the past everyday. 

I’ve had so many girls back in school, and even more recently online when asking for rates on my pic, tell me “HOW UGLY I AM” (less vulgar way of saying it).

But, at 18, I had a female friend (we were both 18) who wanted to have sex with me, I chickened out.

I met some women online over the years, strictly long-distance. Just how it turned out. But the fact that even just a few have found me attractive, leads me to believe that I could attract more women, romantically and sexually, IN REAL LIFE, if I just improved myself and my life. MUCH easier said than done, of course.

For complicated reasons, not necessarily by choice, I’ve been mostly a shut-in since high school, and was never very much socially successful then. 

So I just took all of those negative judgements from all those women, from school, and strangers online, and assumed/concluded I was simply unattractive to the opposite sex. I’ve been hit on by guys, but then again, men still tend to be aggressors and women still tend to expect men to initiate.

It pains me that I haven’t figured my own shit out enough to the point I can move out and support myself at 25, having some decent job that isn’t for high school kids and contributes to advancing society. At the very least, is just work I can be competent enough in and pays well, then I could at least pursue my own things while being confident and secure that I can pay rent and bills, keep myself afloat. And keep having health insurance, since that is VERY expensive and NOT a legal human right in the US).

I don’t want to end up a 30 or 40 year old virgin who’s still never had a girlfriend. But at 25, I haven’t even progressed enough to take care of myself, so I’m not feeling the most optimistic, especially because I still feel so directionless.

I don’t know exactly why I’m in this position still, if I have some kind of disorder/disability not even diagnosed (it’s clear that even if I become more functional, I’m pretty sure I will continue to think differently than most people seem to) and/or fears/traumas just leading to making excuses without even realizing it?

The worst part of being a legitimate victim, is it leading to you victimizing yourself. Not just always feeling like the world is out to get you, but actually abusing yourself, treating yourself worse than anyone ever has.

And in combination of lacking a real life, I’ve absorbed too much information online. I do not think that a lot of the views represented online actually represent real life. Most people do not think “I’ll just completely focus on a career and choose celibacy and single until I become financially successful”.

No, the vast majority of people start dating, having relationships and having sex before they’re even old enough to get into a real career.

My problem is with falling so far behind, everything is now out of balance. The natural (or manmade?) order of things is, go to school for 4+ years, or even excluding that, work in a field for multiple years before making decent money. 

The older you start, the even older you’ll be to reap rewards. It’s not as if minimum wage is enough to live even a basic lifestyle.

Basically every relationship men tell me I'm perfect but eventually they reveal they don't actually love me.

I'm either too good for them or they want a change or i just don't fit into their lifestyle. Even one time a man decided there was no way I was seeing just him even though we'd been together for four fucking years- I never cheated on him, but he was always accusing me of it.


My first told me I was way out of their league so of course they cheated on me, makes total sense right?


One of them decided 2 years in they were asexual and then a woman and so, I wasn't the one for them.


After a year or two their family and friends will try and bring up marriage in conversation. Their mother and father approve, but men don't want it with me.


No one actually wants me. They'll tell me all day, every day, for months, years, that I'm great to be around, funny, sexy, comfy, sweet, perfect even, but they don't actually love me. They don't want me. ""You deserve it,"" then why aren't you providing it?


Getting married seems like a hopeless pipedream. I fucking hate men. They don't love, they don't feel, they just manipulate. Men just string me along for years because they enjoy the convenience of dating me, entertainment and sex I provide and that's it. Must be nice to have a girlfriend all your friends are impressed with and a trophy to show off to your family and work events, one who is completely in love with you that you can just cut off at any moment or treat however you want.


I hate people. Its not even just men, i'm starting to legitimately not trust a single person.

I go on a lot of dates with women who are interested to hear about my hobbies. But I'm quite a modest person and I always downplay it. I only answer their question at face value and leave it at that. 

But i worry that it makes it sound like I'm a bit incompetent, and if i'm committing a lot of time to pursuing a hobby (which I am) it isn't attractive if they assume you're not very good.

For example, i don't mention that i got past grade 8 guitar and am now learning to play virtuoso stuff. 

That's because i see this as being unsolicited arrogance and that's not attractive at all! So I ALWAYS downplay my achievements (e.g. ""well I've practiced a lot so i'm better than I used to be"") and i don't tell them more than they ask.

But on the other hand I worry if I don't tell them my credentials upfront, they may just assume I'm a bit useless. And women don't like that.

I really don't feel comfortable being more upfront with my achievements, and can't imagine it would help, but then again the more modest approach isn't getting me anywhere, soo...

Problem is: I like spending time with her, I like talking to her and sharing stories and I care about her for sure, but... I am not in love. I'm also not seeing her solely for the intercourse. The sex is just a nice (and usually guaranteed) sidedish.

Now, I'm not so sure where I stand. I don't get in love easily, appearantly (as it has happened before), and I feel that's a requirement when settling for a long-term serious commitment. These ""give me your forever dedicated love right now"" - deadlines make me uncomfortable and really turn me off even further.

She answered that she needs to go back to work to pay her bills, and that when her son started working she would stop -referring to the middle son that was listening the conversation.

Roughly once every 2 weeks, but we never planned it, it just happened that I was around her town or she was around mine(I live literally half way between her and her parents), we live far and when we're not together there's basically radio silence besides some photos of one of her hikes or something she cooked.   


Neither of us are the chit-chatty type and we're both pretty busy with stuff. She's studying medicine and I'm C-level at a startup, so we're definitely busy. 

How can I keep this alive, or better yet, how can I keep it alive and relatively sexual to not fall into an overly ""bland"" pattern? Sex has always been on point, I've been pretty dominant and she's enjoyed the rides. It's been very unpredictable and pretty hot, lot's of choking, hair pulling, slapping, outdoors, on a rock, bent over a pile of logs, etc.  


So the time we've had together has been absolutely grand, but there is a lot of time not together, and there will be more. I'm very into her and want to explore the LTR potential. It may require some ""long distance"" time, but if I am to make that suggestion to her it would be non-committed, to keep doing what we're doing of coming to see each other once/twice per month, an if we're still enjoying it in 6 months to a year to talk about her moving in, having a longer trial period or something.

She has called me a couple of times but I have never called her. Is this something I should consider? I can be a bit of a dead fish emotionally.  


I told her I'll be in her town on the 7th and asked if she would be free. She said she'd let me know. Should I have instead \*told\* her to be free? She's made time for me before even ignoring important university work by overstaying at my place and even re-buying tickets for a later day. So there's interest. Although I don't want to make her do that again when it gets in the way of important work.

&amp;#x200B;

We've also been in the same room for hours in complete silence whilst she was studying and I was reading. So we can do that too.  


I want to make it clear that I'm very interested without making her feel ""trapped"", and letting her come to me, but letting her know that I really want her to come to me, if she wants. No needy BS.  


We met in a bar over a year ago but she had a bf at the time. She hit me up a few months ago after they broke up, but by then I had moved from that town. Time together is really pleasant. Similar temperaments/interests/etc.

She had dogs in her life but mostly Aspin or Filipino dogs, which are kinda like alley dogs. They are cool, smart, and super loyal, like all dogs do, but she really wanted those cute pure expensive breeds which I don't agree. Because to me they are all equal, and also, WHY DO I HAVE TO PAY FUCKING 250 USD ON A FUCKING DOG? I could get a rescue puppy and spend it on it's food, vaccines, toiletries, and toys. But no, she wants one with breed. It is not worth it for me if I can get a friend/buddy for free instead buying one for a price of new equipment I need for my job.

86,n14ofo,1619703940,"Is Being Medically Anxious a ""Red Flag"" When It Can't Be Cured?","Hey there.  I'm using an alternate account, identify as male/sexually am a male because I kind of don't want anyone to actually know about this, but I have anxiety.  Like, I was diagnosed with it.  Sometimes I have anxiety/panic attacks that make me unable to operate for hours or days.  Yes, anxiety attacks are actually real and not made up.  At least sometimes they are.  My anxiety tends to manifest in becoming worried about people not responding to me for long periods, especially in this era of covid, where previously I mainly interacted with people face-to-face in order to avoid situations like this, I no longer can alleviate my concerns if someone suddenly stops communicating.  This obviously means that ghosting hurts me a lot, especially if I built up a rapport with that person over time.  At it's worst, I shift into what could be described as a ""Romantic Drama SML/Villain"", becoming clingy and desperate, although I have never, ever threatened a person.  Whether or not anyone has interpreted my increasing levels of neediness as threatening, I am not sure and although there have been past events where my anxiety was a significant factor, I have made peace with them.

I recognize that I have this weakness.  I take medication for it everyday.  I actively work to recognize and ""restrain"" it.  I do my best to be patient when communicating, to not be overbearing in conversations, to not worry about where someone is at a given time.  It is natural for me to worry about things, about people, but for the sake of it not being ""normal"", for my wish for a level of stability most people seem to think is unnatural despite it being the only way for me to interact with others in a comfortable manner, I go against my nature, a literal mental illness that although not on the same level as BPD still gives me problems sometimes.  

But I'm a bit frustrated at this point, because if you tell people that this is the way you feel, that this is the way you are, oftentimes they refuse to be accommodating, or they suggest you need therapy (why yes, I do go to therapy, why do you ask asshole?), or they see this as a ""red flag"" or declare it so.  Why does my condition have to be described as a ""red flag"", like this could be easily fixed, that otherwise I'm a broken person who should be avoided?  I have worked hard on myself.  I believe myself to kind-hearted and thoughtful, and have continuously had this belief confirmed by other people.  I am not a monster.  Is there some kind of cabal of people masquerading as having anxiety but actually are stalkers/abusers/etc.?  If someone has even interacted with a person who claimed anxiety either initially or afterwards and then did something heinous, please tell me in the comments.  

I guess what I'm saying is I'm sick of people like me, people who have problems with mental illness but are actively dealing with them, automatically being written off.  Am I somehow impossible to love because of one trait I have that I can't change?  I don't believe that.  I can't believe that.  Inceldom doesn't suit me anymore.  I feel more beautiful every day, both inside and out, but this is the one thing I can't change.  I know that this might get a lot of refutation, that I might be incorrect, but I wanted to go mask off at least once because it just makes me so frustrated.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n14ofo/is_being_medically_anxious_a_red_flag_when_it/

I have a date with a girl who has autism tomorrow. Id like to start of by saying this is not a big deal for me what so ever. I like her a lot, I've known her for a long time and we call and text a lot. Tomorrow is the first time I am going to see her in almost a year, and its a date. We always have a good time when we meet, and the fact that she has autism is barely noticeable sometimes.

But, when it comes to dating I don't really know. We are both kind of awkward when it comes to this, but when you go on a date the tension is obviously different, especially when it comes to touching, holding hands, hugs, and kisses. I don't know how tackle this, will she be okay with touching, or will she be really uncomfortable with that? Lets say we go on another few dates, can I ask her for a kiss? Is there anyone with experience? Do I just ask her what she likes? I am nervous about this, because I don't want to come on too strong but I don't want to be weird either.

92,n14yal,1619704765,Is his drinking a problem or am I overreacting?," I honestly don't know if I'm making this a bigger issue than it actually is or what. 

So I used to be married to an alcoholic. Naturally, sometimes I get triggered by alcohol related tendencies. I like to drink and have no problem with other people drinking socially. My problem is when I see people behaving in a way my ex used to. 

I've been dating a new guy for a few months now. It's just recently that I've noticed some things...honestly I feel like he was on his best behavior before and just has kinda let his guard down. A few weeks ago he was out with some friends for his birthday. I offered to pick him up, but he said he was fine to drive. Showed up at my house and was clearly very drunk, slurring his words, etc. I let it go. 

We had plans to hang out last night, and I asked if he would pick up something from the store for me on his way home since I was working later than he was. After work he went golfing. Which okay, fine. Except when I got to his house, again he was absolutely hammered. Hadn't gone to the store for me so I couldn't make dinner and when I asked how he got home, he said he drove. Once again, slurring his words and everything. It bothers me for all sorts of reasons. One, because it reminds me of my ex. I don't want to hang out with someone who is drunk while I'm sober. I also don't drink during the week. And it just seemed rude or something, that he knew we were hanging out and had plans but got very drunk anyways. And then there's the fact that he sees no issue driving while drunk. 

He apologized to me this morning a lot, and said he'd make it up to me. 

But to me, this is like a huge sign of immaturity and potential future problems. At 28, I feel like you should know when to stop drinking for the night and be in better control of yourself. 

He texted his apology to me so I haven't answered yet because I'm not sure what I want to say. I don't want to be like ""oh it's okay, don't worry about it""...because I'd be lying. 

I just don't know if what I went through with my alcoholic ex is skewing what's going on here, or if what I'm feeling is valid. 

What can I say to him? I don't know if I want to say 'hey what you did last night reminds me of my ex, and I don't like it'...which is what it is, but I don't want to seem like I'm comparing the two. 

Am I overreacting?

How can I tell him that his drinking bothers me without feeling like I'm attacking him?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n14yal/is_his_drinking_a_problem_or_am_i_overreacting/
93,n15cbz,1619705894,"a girl im working with, we've been talking for 6 weeks, past 2 weeks been very distant on phone, I really miss it, shall i tell her?","so you maybe able to see from my previous posts, I started a new job, where I work there's this really sweet girl, beautiful, funny, kind.

within days of starting we hit it off, I Was added to whatsapp group, messaged her privately from there to which she was very happy, we got talking, we would message regularly back n forth for hours, talking laughing joking flirting.

shed said videos of her tiktoks, voice notes, in to the early hours of the night, wake up and then I'd see some, warmed my heart.

in work she was very flirty, she'd punch me, brush in to me, I'd catch her looking or she'd catch me and she'd smile,  she'd hold eye contact but not for too long and blush, flip her hair, when we went down for stock refills she'd comment are you following me and laugh, I'd say you'd love that and she'd say stuff like maybe I will.

anyways recently last week we barely messaged, when we do it's slow and less, I brought I up she said ""you know I'm tragic with replying and my phone, I'm more of an in person sort of girl ""(she wasn't st the start?

this week at work 1 day we worked together she was a lil flirty, called me her fave, said I'd be a catch for any girl, said she liked my haircut etc etc.

but since Monday we message once or twice a day, 9pm a convo start now, respond next day 9pm.
now I know she owes me nothing, were not dating so can't expect her to keep in touch always.

but I really just miss talking to her, and no it's not just a girl attention I miss cuz another girl is blowing up my phone but I'm just not interested.

I miss her, the back and forth, the feeling I'd get seeing a notification from her.

should I ask her what's changed? should I raise her saying she says she's not a phone person but when we started she was? should I tell her I miss talking to her?

He hasn’t freaked out like most guys in the past about the thought of commitment, he’s so communicative and we’ve been speaking everyday since we met. Long story short, I met him 3x the first week we met as we hit it off well, he found out his heart surgery was much sooner so moved home to his mum which is 5 hour drive, where he will recover etc. 

I recently just visited him after two weeks of not seeing him, he told his mum about me so she let me stay over for two nights. Everything went so well! She was so lovely and I met other people he knew where he introduced me. We both thought how crazy it was that I drove 5 hours for him but yeah hahah I don’t regret it he lives by the sea and it was such a beautiful weekend, like a mini holiday for me. And plus after surgery I’m not sure when I can see him due to recovery being quite difficult so thought would be good idea before. 

We have both now basically said we aren’t speaking to other people and regardless of the situation and distance we want to keep it going. He seems genuine and had expressed he feels bad that he’s basically brought this onto me. But honestly it doesn’t bother me, I’m in final year uni anyways so focussing on that too! Kinda works out. To me it’s worth it to at least give it a try and make it work. We both don’t pressure eachother and things just seem to flow and are easy. 

His surgery is in two weeks so he’ll need to isolate now. I make funny cards and think I want to send him a card before operation with dark choc (he loves it) just as a little good luck thing!? He’s so positive but I think at times the surgery scares him of course and I know not being able to work out and lose his strength gets him down secretly. He knows I make cards and loves them so I plan to make one of him at the hospital with beer since we joked about how he’ll be craving one after surgery hahaha. Do you think this would be a nice gesture? Nothing serious just a funny card to chirp him up as he’ll be bored in isolation",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n15uka/everything_seems_to_be_going_well_im_feeling/
