1,slkqxi,1644106005,My GF (35F) and I (46M) broke up because I was too flexible.,"So, some background-My ex-GF (35F) and I were dating 7 months, when this month we had an argument about what we need in a relationship. Essentially, she only was talking about her needs spiritually, mentally and relationship-wise; I was trying to work and see what WE needed to do to get through the difficult times. 

During the argument, I asked her if she could compromise - she said that she 'didn't know how much more she could bend' for me. I said that she never did compromise with me, or accept me for who I am, and she AGREED. She said it was because I was 'too flexible', that I wanted to learn too much about everything and that I wanted to grow and change. Those attributes were RED FLAGS for her. She was being serious.

It hurt, but we completed the breakup today.. And I'm trying to figure out what I could have done better. Thoughts?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/slkqxi/my_gf_35f_and_i_46m_broke_up_because_i_was_too/

It feels like with every major life-change I loose friends. Either by their choice, just growing apart, or by my choice (my priorities change, I realize once the drunken parties are over we really don't have much in common). So I find my self at 40-something, in these hard-to-meet-people COVID times, single for the first time in 20 years, with no friends. 

I have a full life that I am proud of, and I honestly like a lot about myself (I know that sounds weird) and love time to myself. And I know once it's easier to socialize again I will join a group and meet like-minded people and hopefully find some people to call my friends.

She has sent very tepid responses with large time gaps. We used to chat all the time. 

Do I apologize ? All I can think about saying is I think I can get past it or used to it but that sounds absolutely terrible may only make her feel worse . We were really hitting it off.

16,sm3opr,1644172057,What dos and don‚Äôts could you share for messaging/dating?,"My perspective is from a female dating men but please share from any perspective you wish.

Don‚Äôt talk sex/lewd too early unless you‚Äôre sure they would be game

Don‚Äôt be too familiar too early (good morning beautiful every day etc) let that build up naturally 

Don‚Äôt tell lots of tales of your hilarious fuckups/clumsiness/carelessness. This may be funny to friends but a date will be worrying whether they are getting involved with a liability. 

Don‚Äôt tell me in-depth details of your family/kid‚Äôs lives. I want to know about you at this point, that can come later. 

Make sure your nails are clean and trimmed. We really notice this. (Honourable mentions to ear/nose/eyebrow trimming) 

Ask before going in for a kiss. But also read body language and preferably don‚Äôt even ask if it doesn‚Äôt seem welcome yet. 

If you get asked a question make sure you send one back. Asking the same one back is ok but make sure you‚Äôre coming up with your own too. 

Make them interesting but don‚Äôt ask questions that are hard work. Keep them thoughtful but can be answered relatively easily. 

Don‚Äôt ask ‚Äúso tell me about yourself‚Äù it‚Äôs too broad. Be more specific. 

Stop asking what a day in their life looks like. It always feels like I‚Äôm having to justify my existence. 

Be polite when rejected. It says a lot about you and could even result in a change of heart later on (but don‚Äôt assume so)

43,sn3i14,1644274129,"She (40 ) manipulated me (49) and i miss her, how's that possible?","After a long time (about 4-5 years) without a serious relationship, I met this girl. She initiated contact with me, and although on the first dates I was not convinced of her, I called her one night after the 4-5th (she told me that she had doubts after those dates too) and everything started to roll. We speak clearly.

I know that I am going to shorten the story a lot, but Reddit is not a lover of very long stories, which is strange, because in personal relationships it is difficult not to give data, situations, experiences, etc. and that history be seen well for those who are from outside.

But the key point is that what I thought was love was simple attraction and then interest. And that's why she said that she needed time (after 3 months) to be able to tell me (although she did things like give me Christmas gifts, give me craft gifts where she said I love you and things like that, etc.), to tell me that she loved me or whatever. . Yes, we were going to a hotel. We would meet up to have sex, she would cuddle up on the bed, she would intertwine her feet with mine, etc. According to her, she loved sex with me. And not because I asked. She liked her sex with me... but she didn't feel some kind of ""love"" for me?

What was happening?

But she is an ambitious person. Competitive (as a couple and at work, and that was annoying sometimes). And manipulative, perhaps. Because she never told me, for more than 3 months of relationship until she finished, I love you. I like you a lot (or something). I like your mouth. I like to be with you. I like the smell of your neck. Never is never. And I realized, when we finished, that she was never going to tell me.

Add her extreme care and fear that they would see us together at work or during our outings in the city. If we were out of it, she would grab my hand, she would let me grab her waist. But if I said that she had gotten some tickets to a show and used my wits to get something extra by saying that she was coming with my partner, she didn't like it. Or if she came to my house (we live in a small town), she excused herself by saying that she was discreet and wanted to do it hide the most she can (and she told she was a very traditional woman and that she did not like that). At the end of 3 months, I was tired of putting up with this situation

In that discussion, the day we broke up, she became cold and very aggressive. She went to hurt me with personal, sexual things, even remembering shit from the past. I was WTF, and then i started to say bad things about her (but not insulting her, only arguments but being brutally honest). 

I hadn't seen her like this in 3-4 months we were together. Never so cold and mean, that was like an angel to demon, really. We never said anything so harsh to each other, but I did notice that the last week she was very touchy making jokes about my possible flaws and others. And when she left my house, where we get that broke up, she told me that lately she had doubts, that if she needed time, and I told her: time for teenagers, we are adults and we have only been here for 3 months, nothing of time. And she says: well, I'll leave it. And I answered: she was waiting for you to say it. And after that fight, she added that she didn't want me to say hello or something at work (so she can hide it until the end of the earth). After that, we are 2 weeks without any contact, and at work she walked past me and we didn't say hello, nothing, not a view. Amazing cold woman that never seem before on her that behaviour, this people is really shocking. Really shocking.

I know it's not much info and details, but going to my house and doing it half in secret, worried about being seen together, etc., and all those love sayings that she never said, annoyed me, but then she would say: please, let's change the subject, oh well, I'd rather be single, and then I changed the subject, and I don't know how, we ended up normal, as if nothing had happened, and another day downs and the relationship goes on, cause when i was in intimacy with her, not only doing sex, i felt like i love her and she was so nice and affectionate... but not to say nothing about her feelings (that maybe she never felt: 15-20 days ago she said that we were in different emotional levels... but I didnt get the hint, and she added again that she needed time, and i answered: well, we were 3 months and some say that falling in love is around 6 first months, and she said: so i have 3 more... weird?!) . She was a master not answering the critical questions i asked her and she changed the subject and then lets go tomorrow to the beach with my caravan, let's go swimming, lets go to your house to have sex... and i followed her like an idiot, because i was having fun, because i miss a relationship a lot, and i was not taking time to think about what was happening.

What I want to say is that for me that girl gave me different and new, exciting experiences, and I fell in love with her.

But she didn't want a partner. She wanted to have a boy with benefits, the ones she liked, but continue with her life. No extra commitments of any kind, neither she nor she intended to fall in love, or anything. She made me food, gave me things, bought trips for the two of us as a surprise... but always outside the small town where we lived, and yes, a town where everyone knew everyone's life and she, due to her job ambition I think. Keep her image as a single woman and when i met her at work, everybody told me she was single from 3 years ago working there, but she told me she had another men in her life, during months, some during a year, in all these years... 41 years old, me 49, wanting to grow in the company i started worked this last year (from september, our relationship was from october 2021-january 2022), like me, who, by the way, have a much better resume than her, although she knows how to move very well and well, then she's a hottie, beautiful, tall, dark-haired, and she knows how to handle people very well and who she gets close to and who she doesn't, I say it like it is, she told me a lot about her plus what I saw at work and that's the image she wants to give: professional, discreet, etc.

From my point of view, she manipulated me, or something happened that i can't understand (not only that maybe she was tired of the relationship and want another, she told me: i was looking for some guys... that shit hurted me a lot during our break up, she was mean, and added: i know we didn't falling in love with each other, don't worry, you'll find another woman soon...). She was a bitch there. I answered very angry and hurted.

I was a guy to keep me secret, so if the things don't go, or she doesn't want to keep dating me, she can return to his life without nobody notice it.

It was machiavellian. I promise you all that i never see this after the broke up. I'm still shocked.

And since I was surprised by all that behavior and I didn't understand it, in return she pleased me, she prepared things for both of us like dinners, she took me into her life under her rules (that i was not aware of that, i accepted those rules without weigh them correctly because I liked her and felt comforted in many ways, and then she came back to her house. Except for hotel nights or specific days, weekends, the rest of the time each one lived in her house, she had her life like a single woman going to the swimming club with some new friends (that now i understand she never told them about me), she never introduced me to a friend because he said that those who lived there were not friends enough to do so, until I got fed up with those excuses, so many, that that night I caused the breakup. And when I asked her the bottom of the truth, there she was, cold, bitch, hurting me, yelling at me that she didn't want a relationship with a guy from work and I told her what the hell we were doing together for 3-4 months and she kept quiet, and then changing the argument to justify the break. Tremendous.

Not even a month ago she had the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãgoing to live together in a rental, with separate rooms, etc. When she left him, she didn't mention it. She just wants someone in her life by her standards. Like the typical man who cheats on a woman, she gives him flowers, she has her cajoled, seduced... but she doesn't want anything serious. She manipulates her.

And what do I do now if I see her at work, at the supermarket, when i see her at gym. Last day, we went out almost together. She turned her face a little, saw me, and then started walking fast, as if i were a stalker. It feels fucking bad and it hurted.

Does she ever loved me? What the fuck what happened? I was manipulated? What to do now? Call her to ask her for an explanation? I don't know what to do now, i'm fucking lost and hurted inside, i was thinking in a future with her and now i'm devastated. I miss her a lot even after all this mess. This is crazy, i know, but right now is very hard to me to think that she was manipulating me and that i gave her that power. I think about myself that i'm a strong and clever guy, but how the fuck i let her do this on me.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sn3i14/she_40_manipulated_me_49_and_i_miss_her_hows_that/

Question for the women here..guys with experience, feel free to chime in. 

I (45M) ‚Ä¶live in a small city. A lot of social circles intersect here. I‚Äôve been following a woman on Twitter for a year or 2 now. She doesn‚Äôt post pics of herself or tweets any personal information but she has an amazing sense of humor, seems smart, and posts some occasional nsfw stuff that excites me. Lol. 

My account is also very vague. No pics or self identifying stuff either. 

My a weird twist of luck and a little subsequent detective work, months ago, I discover who she is. I stumbled across her ig page and she‚Äôs gorgeous. 

I continued liking her tweets that I genuinely found funny from my locked twitter account. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, while on a new year twitter break I see a follow request come up from her. At that point my timeline is empty my tweets auto delete after a week. 

I log on to twitter to check a news story and accept her request then send her a dm saying ‚Ä¶‚ÄùI‚Äôve been following you for a while.  Love your sense of humor. I‚Äôm on a twitter break and my tweets delete automatically. Don‚Äôt want you to think I‚Äôm a bot or creep. Thanks for the follow and I‚Äôll see you in a few weeks on the timeline. 

Since being back we‚Äôve been exchanging music on the timeline. She sent me a music suggestion via dm and we‚Äôve been going back and forth the last few days. She‚Äôs been putting me on to some great music.

I want to send her a dm saying I‚Äôd love to have a virtual coffee or drink date with her. I don‚Äôt want to come across as creepy either. 

I‚Äôm kinda old school. Social media is really just for jokes, music and nba highlights. I‚Äôve never ‚Äòapproached‚Äô a woman out the blue like this before.

We dated for almost 6 months. I tried to break up with him after new years at 5 months in, I let him convince me it could still work. (Sigh). We did both put some work into it, to try to learn each other's language better.

A month later, still together, my body was telling me it wasn't working. Sex life died and I just didn't want it. I didn't want to kiss him, I felt nervousss at his place, and couldn't calm.

We had a language barrier and I couldn't connect to him, I wasn't attached. I could speak his language but not like a native speaker, and not great socially. I enjoyed his company. But, signs showed me that we didn't actually ""get"" each other. I knew that in his native tongue, he was a different person, not bad. I just knew that with me he couldn't be himself - he spoke his second language and he was not great at it. Our conversation was empty. He missed a lot of details about me. I spoke all the time, he tried to, but not as much. Miscommunication on little things added up. Nothing serious but... enough to know this wasn't working.

He told me I was wonderful and I think, he compared me to his ex and I really was a good catch for him in comparison, that he was willing to be blind to issues.

I just couldn't go through with it, despite the many kind things he did for me, the many kind ways he had about himself, and his love for me.

I also don‚Äôt want to be with someone that doesn‚Äôt have compassion and can‚Äôt handle potentially taking care of me in the future if needed. Someone who is understanding if plans have to change. I try my best and usually succeed and push myself to do things but there are days when I might not be able to do as much.  So is it best just to say it in the profile or wait?,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/soh7f1/dating_with_medical_conditions/

87,sotb8n,1644455266,"Does anyone like the opera, symphony, ballet etc?","I‚Äôm asking because I was offered a free ticket to the opera last night (the magic flute and it was PHENOMENAL!!!!!) and it made me realize how important being able to do this with a partner as it would make a great date night. Last night made me think that I might invest in some season tickets. Only thing is the demographic last night skewed much older. Maybe it was just last night but I think it would be really cool to meet people there but is this just not something people in our demographic tend to do? I know no one can know what everyone else is doing but I just thought I‚Äôd see what DO40 peeps have to say.


As a side note we are gearing up at my work for our film festival (god help me lol) and that demographic skews older too! Do people our age just not have interest in these things? It‚Äôs part of why I love my job, I get to be involved in these amazing things but I guess it makes me kinda sad it‚Äôs not a great place to meet people of this age.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/sotb8n/does_anyone_like_the_opera_symphony_ballet_etc/

Now he asked to send him the essays i wrote last year to read. He has nothing to do with studies, researching or even didn‚Äôt state what topic he‚Äôs interested in.

I struggle with this a lot in dating men but not women (I am a 40F who dates men and women).

It‚Äôs very tiring being completely in the listener mode for the whole time. Should I say anything to him?

98,spfzhi,1644524292,Ashamed of my exploring stage,"I've been divorced for 4 years and feel like I never spent the time to date a lot of people. I didn't date much before my 18-yr marriage. Since divorce, I've been in 3 serious relationships that I didn't feel compatible in and left.

I feel like the right path for me is to date a lot of people to get a feeling for what I like and want. Before now, my method was to try the first person that comes along, given they pass my dating app filters and seem like a good fit at the moment. We get intimate and I immediately go into relationship mode with feelings of attachment. This approach seems to have led me down a path of very slow progress. At this rate, I'll go through 12 more LTR breakups over the next 10 years until I find the right one. 

I also get the feeling that I'm not experienced enough to know who is right for me. 

What are your thoughts on a casual dating approach where LTR is off the table? Do you think it's useful for someone like me? It seems like an okay thing as long as everyone is upfront and okay with it. I do say it upfront in my dating profile.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/spfzhi/ashamed_of_my_exploring_stage/
