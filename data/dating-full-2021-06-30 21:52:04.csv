It's harder too when you're stronger at holding conversations in person, and online you need to try and guess what might get the person interested as everyone's different. 

I hate pick up lines, I just want to know how they are doing and getting to know them, then go on a date instead of wasting weeks occasionally messaging each other. 

It feels like everyone just doesn't want to put the effort out, and and they can't ever give the benefit of the doubt to at least try a conversation. I can always guarantee the more we talk to better the conversations get, but it's so rare for that to happen. 

While I know I'm not perfect, I know I'm not bad looking, I have a decently interesting life, and I'm really into a wide variety of things, so it's not like I'm boring or a disrespectful as I actively make sure to not be that kind of person (I appreciate my parents for making sure I turned out as a decent person)

We broke up over two years ago and since then, for some reason I have not been even remotely interested in anyone else.


The weird thing is, it’s not that I’m not over him, by any means. I broke up with him, for one- he was very immature and our goals just weren’t aligning; nothing abusive or anything like that. And for two, I probably think about him maybe once a week, if that! And it’s been like this since about the first six months.


I gave myself some time after the breakup to put myself out there. But when I did... I just couldn’t find myself interested in *anyone*. I went on dates with probably 4-5 guys, guys that I know intellectually I SHOULD be attracted to, guys that are totally my type but... nothing. Of course after about the second date, after really giving it the college try I would be honest with them and move on, not wanting to string anyone along.


This even applied to random people on the street. There was no one I found *truly* attractive, who I could even for a second imagine enjoying going out with.


I felt broken. What was wrong with me? I wasn’t torn up about my ex, there was no trauma or anything there... I just couldn’t figure it out. And then, finally... it happened.


This guy was helping out our branch of the company for a few days and I finally felt it- those butterflies, getting flustered talking to him... daydreaming about our lives together haha. It hit me like a ton of bricks. Was I... flirting?? I almost forgot what that felt like... it’s so much fun! This guy objectively may not even be the most amazing to anyone else, but there’s just something about him; I’m totally head over heels!


Sadly and realistically, I’m not sure it will ever work out. He’s done his time with us, and I’m not sure when he’ll be back, if ever. I was hoping he might ask for my number, but he didn’t. And that could be for a plethora of reasons. And you know what?

I am (18F) and I am with this guy that is (19M), and I am actually in a big deal. I am just so confused whether I should stay or not with him even if I love him... We've been together for 5 months almost 6 now, and everyday I keep questioning myself about this relationship. 

First, there was one thing that happened.We were 2 months into our relationship, and he kept telling me that he loves me, he would never hurt me, hell never cheat on me etc and he seemed to be serious about that and told it to me every day. Until one day I found on his phone a conversation with his ex. This day he was really  trying to hide his phone from me so I wondered why and we kept arguing for him to give me his phone four about 2hours.... he finally gave it to me while saying please why did you take it etc... so I read conversations and first of all he was complimenting girls in a weird way it was too familiar and it hurted me... then I saw the one with his ex I literally cried. She was saying yeah I miss you and his said that even if she was joking he takes it... and that he wants to see her,  he was talking about his life and all, and he said that she was the one that made him believe in love.... and he said that to me everyday... he said things that he says to me every day... He speaks to so many girls... he said then when he saw me crying that he was sorry and that he loved me but he was laughing a bit...


Then after a bit I moved on and forgave him. And a month ago I found a conversation in his phone once again it was like this: The girl said I love you he said even if it's a joke I'll take it but then the girl said that I am joking were just friends but that hurted me.... And then she sended her a video and he said ""Oh, god gave you so much..."" with a moan at the beginning.
I was disappointed but not surprised. And he talks to others girls and all but some are just his friends. Since that I didn't check his phone again. But he puts heart on the name of girls in his phone too... but he removed them now I think... And he often lies to me too... these days not really but he often does it...

Then now it's just to hard to trust him like I feel he is going to do it again... He is in general really sweet with me so maybe he really loves me and there are signs that show me that. But it's just hard for me, and he is a guy who were in a lot of relationships that didn't last he was like just playing, and he has a group of friends wich is like that who just count the number of girls they went out with etc...

And now were gonna go into a distance relationship that may last 5 years... Even if since a bit everything is going super alright between us, I just dont know what to do, even if love him... like I am gonna move in a another country start a new life etc... and he is going to be miles away from me...

Me (22f) and him (22m) are recent college graduates who met 2 years ago. I always thought he was cute but never figured he felt the same in return because he never showed any signs, at least until recently. Since the beginning of this semester he seemed to make it really clear that he was into me. Whenever we would have parties he would be glued to me all night, no matter what. He seems to get jealous when I meet new guys at bars/hang out with guy friends he doesn’t know (One night while playing pool with random guys at a bar he came up to me and straight up said ‘I don’t like them’). He always seemed to drop whatever he was doing to help me with my homework (even let me borrow his laptop when mine broke during finals week). I always catch him looking at me when Im not paying attention, there was a period of time where he would say I love you way more than I feel a platonic friend would, whenever he gets really drunk he seems to gain a lot more confidence and is all over me, the list goes on. 

My friends are even convinced that he is very in love with me, but sometimes I get mixed signals from him. Sometimes it’s very hard to get him to agree to hang out one on one, and when we do it’s always a little awkward. I even asked one of my friends (who is super close to him) if she knew about his feelings for me and she had no idea what I was talking about. (She did question me though how I would feel if it was the case he had feelings). He’s also incredibly shy/has social anxiety, especially around me which is why I don’t know how to appropriately approach this situation. Im still in our college town for the summer and he’s visiting right now for probably the last time before I move out. I really want to have a conversation about our potential feelings for each other, but I dont want to make it super uncomfortable/awkward/change our friendship if it turns out he doesn’t feel the same way or at least doesn’t want to act on his feelings.

Is it clear that he has feelings for me? If so, why wouldn’t he have come clean by now? 

Is it a bad sign that his close friend seemed to not have any insight on his feelings for me?

We shared the same family background, had the exact same taste in music and hobbies, and yet tragically, both just got out of 3-4 year relationships. We kinda knew we were fucked from the start. The chemistry was electric, but we were both still licking our wounds. Regardless, I fell for him hard, while he begun distancing himself and sending mix signals.

  • Men legitimately cannot approach women anymore 

We can thank society and feminism for this one, among other things, women have beaten us over the head that they don't want us anymore and that they can handle things on their own and that's perfectly ok... but there's a difference between being independent, and just being standoffish, which a lot of women do nowadays. 

Men don't approach women anymore cause of fear. Now I hear: ""what do men have to fear by approaching women"" well, aside from being immediately shut down with ""uhh I have a boyfriend"" there's a good amount of women out there that are just messed up.. accusing men of false rape allegations generally for a really petty reason or cause they are just that oblivious to how terrible of a person they are. Let's not forget that women are way more likely to cheat than men, justify it and try to play victim with it. 

Honestly? Approaching women in this Era is high risk with little to no reward despite how hard the man tries.

   • Women are way more concerned about themselves 

This is really the funniest part about all this, women wanna be a 1960s wife but they don't actually wanna be a 1960s wife, they want their man to treat them like a queen but they shouldn't be expected to pull their own weight in the relationship and treat their man like the king he is. 

If you wanna know just how shallow and self concerned women can be, go onto tinder and other dating apps, you Lotta women have their standards so far up their ass it comes outta their mouth. Are all women like this? Thankfully no, but oh my lord a huge chunk of them are, the more pretty they are the more they are to be what I described, at least in my personal experience.

   • ""where did all the good men go?""

Oh, They are there, always have been... but never seen or heard cause they are busy working on themselves and doing their passions silently. They aren't coming to women cause lot of them don't need you or alot of have gotten sick and tired of being betrayed by you cause it's just never enough for you. They are tired of trying to show you that they are good for you only for you to go to a guy that'll treat you like a used flesh light.

You call a lot of them ""nice guys"" but in reality when push comes to shove I guarantee that he would defend you better than any other pretty boy fuckboy that likely already has another girl lined up but your the one that chose to not take your time with a quality guy, but hey at least we know you'll inevitably pay the price for your choice. We tried, and y'all convinced us that we aren't good enough and we should just stop trying.

   • Conclusion 

Boy.. this was a mouthful.. but I hope I've helped explain why men don't really get out there.. at least the main reasons I can think of. Men, got anything you think I've missed?

This guy and I have been hanging out for the past few weeks, from what I can tell, he is definitely into me. He also mentioned that he’s not looking for just a sexual thing and asked me if I’m looking for a relationship. Now, this last time we hung out on Monday, we watched a movie in theatres. He was v cuddly and afterwards he told me he didn’t want to take me home yet so we watched the sunset. He got out of the car and walked me to my house. Usually I kiss him a lot before I leave, but for some reason I got nervous and gave him one peck and said bye. He texted me later saying he just got home. 

I didn’t answer his text bc I didn’t know what to say to that? We have a convo on another platform (tiktok) where he sent me a few videos a few days ago, so that night, I replied to the vids he sent a few days ago instead. He replied right away sent me another of a movie we both like and I replied to it as well.. but he didn’t answer me.

Instead, the next day he took it to snapchat to send me a pic, I replied with a pic back and he said “hey cutie” I started replying a bit later than usual, thinking he was distancing himself. He asked me questions like how’s work, etc over the past few days. 

I asked him on Friday what he’s up to and he said “I was actually going to ask you to go to the beach tomorrow” I told him I was working so I couldn’t, but next week works. I told him I’ll think of something for us to do and mentioned mini golf and he said he was totally up for it and said Tues or Weds. So I agreed Weds works... He asked me on Tuesday what I’m up to, I answered a few hours later at 6 and said I had work but we closed early and asked him about what he did. He responded with what he did, but nothing else. I responded the next day and asked what time he wanted to meet today. He told me he’s so so sorry but he has an assignment dude Friday and asked me to schedule for next week. I replied with no worries, yeah we can” and all he said was “thank youuu”. He knows I have the whole weekend off. So why next week?

This is a struggle I have been dealing with for many years, long before it was so common. 

Most of the advice I have seen seems insanely simplistic now in the context of recognizing 55% of guys are now in the same position.

- Take a shower - I shower twice daily on weekdays - once at bed and a quick rinse before work in morning.
- Groom yourself - I've been plucking my unibrow since I was 15. I use a body hair trimmer. I used to shave constantly pre-COVID, but now I allow myself some stubble.
- Get a haircut - I've paid $15 for a haircut and $60 for a haircut with every style and it never made any difference.
- Work out - I've been working out since I was 15. My BMI is 21 and I keep my body fat down. I presume what people mean is: ""Have top 1% athletic genetics and/or use steroids"" since this has done nothing as well except keep me physically healthy (which is great but not helpful for dating).
- Have female friends - I have several who invite me to events and do nice things for me. This has never got me a date.
- Volunteer - I volunteered for years in my 20s and never got a date from it. There are usually at most 1-2 single women your age there and they are there to volunteer too, not be hit on, though I still tried.
- Go to meetups - I went to a few and they were 90% male dominated and hopeless.
- Go to bars/clubs - I have spent hundreds/thousands of hours in bars/clubs when I was younger mostly getting ignored, told ""I have a boyfriend"" or getting one word replies. If you watch the crowd you will see this is what happens to most other guys too.
- Get an education - I got a graduate degree and I have less dating prospects now than when I was younger since I'm older now meaning there are fewer people available to date.

I have seen more posts lately from guys talking about extreme measures like dating overseas or getting leg lengthening surgeries. One guy said he was getting suicidal because he even tried steroids, got ripped, and still couldn't get a date. It seems like so many guys are struggling no matter what.

I sometimes see people claim ""dating it easy for men"" or ""standards are low for men"" and I will challenge them: Make a profile with a normal 5'8"" Indian guy and tell me if you can set up any dates at all.

At this point, I'm just tired. I imagine a lot of other men are too.

My happiness is higher since I started working 7 days a week at my job. I don't need the money but being busy 24/7 and working with people keeps me away from loneliness or despair, so I may just keep doing that. Perhaps I will just work like this forever until I die.

Bondage, roleplay, rape fantasies, knives and guns, punishments, stuff like that. We’ve been together for 2 1/2 years. He recently started talking about how he’s always had really dark fantasies, ever since he was about 12-13. He’s 19 now. He told me how he was always very aroused by rape (which I already knew) but also the thought of actually murdering someone while fucking them turned him on. He would go on gore sites where you can find reallllllllllllly disturbing videos and images of decapitations and stuff (I don’t know if the posts were real or not) and he’d look up rape stuff and find the aftermath pictures extremely arousing. Where the victims are literally mutilated and murdered. He watched a video of a girl slitting her own throat and he got turned on. I looked it up and it’s called erotophonophilia (lust murder) and it’s considered a very dangerous kink that should be seriously managed by a psychologist. He is disgusted by the fact that it turns him on, and he hates himself for it, which is why it took him so long to talk about it with me. The first time he brought it up I was drunk and he made a joke about how slitting my throat while fucking me and continuing to fuck me as I died/was dead turned him on. It disturbs me very deeply and I don’t know what to do about it. He knows it’s wrong. He said he never ever ever do that, he doesn’t want to it’s just a thought. He says (jokingly serious) that if he wanted to he would’ve by now. I just don’t know what to do. I’m into rape fantasies and kidnapping, but real stories and images or videos are absolutely repulsive and I feel anger and empathy in cases of real life sexual assault, they don’t turn me on.

Are those acceptable reasons to want to date?

I just asked a question ""What should a man do if he isn't getting dates?"" 

I described all the things I've done and that I've had no luck. I asked about things like whether I should try dating overseas instead, and the moderator locked my thread saying: ""Removed.  Women can't be bought and sold for your pleasure. You have made  absolutely no mention of your personality or what you want from a  partner. You are shallow, this is why you turn women off.""

Is there something wrong with what I want? Are these shallow or bad things to want?

I’ve been on very few dates before, but most guys had major red flags that any sort of intimacy was off the table, and I usually left before anything happened. Because of this, I’ve never had a first kiss. I told him that I have “dated casually” but never had a bf, which I realize now is probably bad phrasing. It went pretty well in the beginning, up until when we talked about relationships, he asked me if we could kiss. Me being super shy, said that I never kissed anyone before. He seemed really surprised, but mellowed out after I just told him I never had any intimacy and the guys I met were dicks. Though the date seemed off in the end, and now I’m pretty sure he’s ghosting me. So I guess I’m here to ask, is it normal for guys to wanna kiss on the first date? Was my phrasing that bad?

-Her voice would get higher pitch when she started talking to me. 
-Laughed a lot when I said something 
-Raved about how smart and funny I am frequently 
-Called me sir a lot
-Would talk a lot really fast about some off topic stuff smiled when I listened. 
-She said she liked when I would make decisions on what projects to do. 
-When giving an analogy in a financial literacy project, she use her, her kids, and I. 
-On the last day of school we were talking on some benches. She said she wished we could sit next to eachother (no bc of Covid) and asked if she could take a picture of me, then started at it for a long moment after.

I just graduated from college this past May. My freshman year I met this guy, ""J"", who was friends with a boy I was already hooking up with. Things didn’t work out between that guy and me but J and I remained acquaintances. We even got coffee as friends one time and started snap chatting. The snap chatting turned somewhat flirtatious and we ended up kissing on more than one occasion but never anything beyond a dance floor make out. However, I always retained a little crush on him that always on the back burner of my mind.

As time went on, J and I stayed friends, we both had other significant relationships so we didn’t talk very much anymore but would maybe speak to each other on social media every once in a while. J was also older than me so he graduated before me and moved back to his hometown. I found out, upon my graduation that I would be going to grad school in that same town so I set my tinder location to there. Lo and behold I matched with J but I wasn’t sure if it was a “funny seeing you here” or a “here’s our chance to actually confirm that we’re interested in each other” kind of swipe right. I also hadn’t even moved yet so he said “I’ll text you when you move here.” I eventually moved there and about a month passed and I never heard from him. I was still thinking about it- so I did a scary thing and basically asked him to ask me out. I messaged him saying “hey- do you still wanna go out for a coffee” (because I still couldn’t tell if he was interested in me romantically or as friends). He responded, and told me he has a busy week and gets off of work late so it was better for him to hang out late and we could hit a bar. I agreed to the plan and we met up at a bar, actually walked to a few of them, and were genuinely having a good time. But no hand-holding, bodily contact, anything. It was getting late. When the bars were closing he asked me what we should do next, like if we wanted to hang out in the park or in one of our houses. I wasn’t keen to hang out in a park so I said that but also that I couldn’t bring him to my place because my roommate and I share a studio. He invited me over to his and at that point, I figured we were gonna hook up. We get to his place and we’re hanging out, and of course we ended up having sex.

The next day he texted me, saying he had a good time. I was happy he did because I had a great time with him and I’ve always had a little crush on him for all the years that I’ve known him. However- for that same reason, I was mad at myself for having sex with him the first time we went out. I had wanted to for so long to, so I did it- but I can’t kick the patriarchal thought that I “gave it up too easy”.So in my response to J’s text, I said that I had a great time too, but that I hope my actions didn’t change his opinion of me. He said it wasn’t a big deal. It’s now been 4 days since when we went out. Should I expect to hear from him again? And if so, when? Or is the ball equally in my court as it is his?

I dont think I am a loser with no game, I make friends well a d never had problems talking to women.

People and even my girlfriends (not actual girlfriends, just friends that happen to be girls) think I date around a lot. All that makes me feel more depressed, because in reality I never felt loved, and never had a women be interested in me. I recently got out of a 1 year hiatus of not pursuing women because I been rejected too many times (probably over 40 or 50) and I began to get very depressed and hurt myself. This past month I tried everything, dating apps, going to bars, social events, etc. And despite multiple girls saying they want to remain friends with me, none want to be in a relationship. So I am now at a point where if I cannot be in a romantic relationship, I might as well get something that I can obtain easy, sex through a prostitute. I dont want people to get confused now thinking that I think meeting women is all for sex, no.

I’m looking for support, advice, recommendations or just simply wondering if anyone has been through anything similar. 

So I was seeing a girl for about 6 weeks. Everything was going well, until I received a call from her 2 weeks ago telling me she was pregnant. 
We talked it over on the phone and in person over the next week, and from here both decided that the pregnancy would be terminated for many legitimately good reasons. 

She had the procedure last week (wouldn’t let me take her. Got a friend to take her) and there were no complications. 

We both took it all a little hard, but her more so for obvious reasons. 
I offered her my support through the whole process and told her no matter what happened I wanted to keep seeing her, which she seemed happy with. 

Then last night I received a text message from her stating ‘Hey Ben I’m sorry I don’t know how else to do this, but I don’t think we should see each other any more. I’m really sorry, I just need to be alone for a while.’ 
To which I responded with a message saying I’m surprised she would do this by text. 
She agreed and decided to call because I said I just wanted to know the truth about why she didn’t want to see me anymore. 

From here she told me over the phone that she couldn’t imagine being with me now after what we’d been through. She wanted to pretend like it never happened, which unfortunately meant not seeing me too. 

I said I felt the opposite way. That we could support each other through a difficult experience. 

I then offered my support if she ever wanted to talk about things and then goodbyes were said. 

I just thought that the only positive coming from a bad experience like this would be that at least you have the other person there to help you, listen to you, support you and be there for you. 
But now I just feel abandoned. 

To be told by her that she can’t imagine being with me after that experience after we had both agreed to it via a text and call with no warning, just after the procedure happened is very hard to take. 

I just though if it were the other way around, and I told her via text a week after the procedure that I couldn’t imagine being with her now and I didn’t want to see her anymore that I would be deemed by society as the worst person in the world. 

Im not saying it’s exactly the same, but it’s a really horrible thing to have happen and I’m struggling to cope a little bit. 

Oh and it’s my birthday in 3 days. So Happy Birthday to me… haha

As I expected it was really one sided, althpugh he said that i mean a lot to him, but no in a romantic way.

He reasoned it with 1. his past relationship, he got cheated on in his last 3 relationships, which led him to an eating disorder, and he told me he's empty - he can't show me any love because there isn't any he could give.

As a second reason he told me because of these failed relationships he decided to find/ look for someone who has the same cultural background, which doesn't garantee a safe relationship and he knows that. But that's what he wants.

It hurt him, he was sorry for not giving me the answer I hoped for. He asked me how he could help me process this, he asked if he should block me on all social media, if he should just stop texting me, if we should stop being fwb and just hang out as friends.

He really wanted to help me, and make all of this easier. 

It hurt, it hurt so much and I was vrying for the whole night. However, it is what it is and you can't force someone's love and i for sure don't want to do that.

I told him now that I have this clarity we can continue. There's no ""what if"" possibility because I know that there won't be any romantic feelings involved.

I'll definitely be open towards new love, and meeting the right person for me while having fun with him. If there's one thing he takes with him from our time together it should be that it's okay to let your guard down. I want him to know that not everyone has bad intentions.


I feel good now, and I'm certain that I will find my soulmate soon🤞🏻Even though I got rejected I feel like I've found closure. To me it's a succes, I know that it won't take long for me to stop loving him in a romantic way.
