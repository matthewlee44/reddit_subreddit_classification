So I have been dating my bf for 10 months. He’s a good guy. We have plenty of issues and argue about many things, but as a boyfriend, he always makes the effort to make me happy. I care about him a lot. 

As of lately, I have been feeling different about him and it makes me feel guilty.

I’m older than him by a year and I just graduated college and I’m now working in my career. I studied my ass off through school to make it where I’m at. I’m proud of myself and my efforts.

My boyfriend is still in college and he is studying to work in the same field as me, but he has some time left.  I notice he doesn’t perform that well in school and is at risk of failing. He is not much of a hard worker in terms of school and does not take studying as seriously. Maybe this is just normal for a guy, but idk.

He has purposely failed classes in the past due to not caring and if it wasn’t for that he would actually have graduated at the same time as me.

It bothers me sometimes that there is a possibility he may not make it through school and I will end up the sole worker in the relationship until he gets back on his feet. I do not want to be un even in the relationship.

Am i wrong for feeling this way? 

It makes me feel like I can do better..

I told him how I feel about him and that I like him so much, surprisingly guys he already liked me right back.. The energy grew into something fabulous and a relationship came out of it ...

Then she stays the whole time at church in between services and comes back into the sanctuary before the second service and walk over to the same camera I'm sitting by and stands there as if she wants to be noticed but she doesn't say hit or anything.

I told him I wanted to go on a date and we went. I should mention this was our first official date but we had hung out often before this. 
It was absolutely great, we just felt so in synced.  We got drinks and later got to business. Although we didn’t discuss a solution great improvements were made. I do hope that we can have open communication about us physically connecting going forward.

I don't like dating women that are younger or around my age for several reasons.   


I often find that women that are 5-10 years older than me are far more experienced in life, they're more independent, they're usually more emotionally mature, and they're more trustworthy when it becomes to having a serious partner in general. However, most of the older women that I meet say I'm too young for them even if we are only 5 years apart. Some older women that I meet would even settle for an older man that doesn't even treat them well just because he is older. Could it be that they had a bad experience with dating younger men before? Or do they prefer someone with more experience? Whatever the answer may be, I know I need to start somewhere but I don't want to date a younger woman because they usually lack most of the qualities that I am looking for in a serious partner.

He said he needed to figure out his “new life,” he had gotten divorced 10 months prior while on deployment and was trying to sort out how to co-parent his 3y.o with his now ex-wife, and didn’t want to drag that into my life among other things. He also mentioned that he struggles to feel any emotion beyond “the basics,” happy, sad, anger, etc. He states that he still has moments where he feels romantic feelings towards me but they also disappear and he can’t explain it. He says it has to do with not being able to feel a full range of emotion. 
  We’re in a comfortable place now where we hang out frequently, spend the night together, have sex, but also kiss and cuddle casually while without it leading to sex. All casual kisses and cuddles are initiated by him. He’s begun to compliment me more which is huge for him expressing his feelings, which he struggles with. &amp; he knows that words of affirmation is a very strong love language of mine. 
  Yesterday I had a very serious family emergency and he was the first person I called. He let me come over and snuggled with me on the couch, showed me memes, bought me chinese food and played video games with me. I tried to leave multiple times because I felt like I was distracting him from studying for a very important and difficult school that he’s been waiting on for a long time.

  I’m genuinely in awe that he knew exactly how to take care of me while I was in total shock and didn’t even know how to take care of myself in that moment. He continues to open my car door for me and neither one of us is sleeping with anyone else. He honestly doesn’t have any other women in his life besides me and his daughter.

We had a conversation maybe a month after the breakup where he expressed that as soon as he is ready to date again, if I’m single, I’m the first person he would think of to pursue.

TLDR version of the backstory is: I go see this girl at her work twice every week donating plasma, she screens me most of the time, we talk and get friendly and know each other. I give her my number on a note, she loses it and then asks me to write down my number for her in her notepad. She sends me a “hey this is blank text”, next time I see her I ask her if she wants to hangout she says yes. I text her an idea we should do, and I get ghosted. I took it she wasn’t interested and backed off and didn’t want to bring it up again.

Now 4 months later I’m still falling for her and never let go. I know ghosting is most definitely a definitive not interested in situations, but I never got a definitive no from her and I’m still hanging on to this hope. I’ve done a good job at suppressing my feelings these past 4 months but lately they have just taken over. I can’t help but feel when I talk to her she seems interested, she’ll do things like glance at me whenever I walk in, wave bye to me whenever I walk past her to leave. I know that’s just kind customer service behavior but man I don’t see her doing that to anyone else. It’s not even just basic customer service stuff either, she said she likes my curly hair once and I heard that and made sure that every time I see her my curls would show. A process in the screening is they have to check your blood pressure, she told me my blood pressure was kinda high and I played coy and said “I wonder why” knowing damn well I get so nervous talking to her. She raised her eyebrows and said idk like she knew, but didn’t want to say anything. 

And then I’ve seen her 3 times at college so far (we both go to the same school), twice we ended up talking while she was walking to class and the 3rd I saw her walking but I was too far away for her to notice me. The first time we ran into each other there (we were walking in opposite directions and basically meeting in the middle and I didn’t even notice her in normal clothes and not in scrubs and she said hey to make me realize it was her), she asked me for a pencil for her test she had in 5 minutes because hers just suddenly broke and I gave her one of my good pencils and she in return gave me her pen. Now I know she could’ve just really needed a pencil, but people do that sort of stuff when their flirting. The second time we ran into each other I was walking just a little behind her, I knew it was her but didn’t want to yell out her name, so I started to speed up my walking. I passed her but I made sure to look down at my phone to make it seem like I didn’t see her. I wanted to see if she actually would call my name out and get my attention and want to talk to me even when she wasn’t obligated to and sure enough she did. So we had a little conversation while she was walking to class. I got this little joke with her saying I barley can recognize her when she’s not wearing her work scrubs, and that’s why I didn’t notice her at school. But the third time I saw her at school I guess she came straight from work, cause she was wearing her work pants, and the next time I went to see her at work, I told her I finally noticed her on campus because of the pants, but she was just too far away to talk to. She said “you only notice me when I’m wearing my work clothes, almost as if she wants me to notice her outside of work. Even if shes not interested in dating, its so weird that someone could be this friendly with someone and do all this stuff and wouldn’t even want to be friends. I remember seeing on TikTok a video from her about a week after I asked her out (I wasn’t stalking or anything, her contacts was in my phone and I guess TikTok can show you videos from your contacts) I saw a video of her arm and someone else’s arm holding hands no faces or anything. I took that as that she had a boyfriend, but I didn’t know for certain. She has never made an indication of her having a boyfriend to me and I saw recently her TikTok account does not have the video anymore. 

I have been just mentally tormented from this the past couple of weeks, it just feels like everything I repressed over the summer is coming back in full force. I’m thinking about her 24/7, she’s even appeared in my dreams. Seeing her on the days I do get to see and talk to her just ends up being the highlight of my day. I feel a deep pit in my stomach when ever I think about her. I lay in bed at night thinking of her. I go on walks everyday just to clear my head about this. I know I’ve been turned down by her before and probably nothing has changed, but getting half I like you half I’m not interested in you stuff is just so confusing. It’s giving me hope that something could be there, but we’ve already went through this once, I don’t want the same thing to happen again. I want to do something like when we have our weekly conversations, mention something about me wanting taking a trip to Orlando to Universal Studios sometime in the next 2 months during a weekend off from school (cause I have a season pass that expires at the end of the year, and I do want to go back but I’ll be by myself). She’ll say something to the extent like “that’s nice” or “sounds fun”, and I’ll say “hey if you wanna come with just say the word and we can plan it out, I’ll pay for your ticket and everything”. Now how many girls are eager to take a 5 hour trip to Florida with a guy they somewhat barely know…idk but I think its worth a shot as a really fun date idea, and we could hangout before then to get comfortable with each other. I just want a definitive answer about how she really feels about me, does she like me back?, am I just a friend?, am I even a friend or does she just tolerate me cause I’m a customer? Playing this game is just causing me way too much pain and heartache. Never have I felt like I was this close to a girl liking me back and never I have a felt this way about someone. She is just so gorgeous and makes me feel something so special, that losing something I never had in the first place and accepting she’s not interested would take months of healing. Are these signs she might like me now and just wasn’t interested back then or had someone else, or am I just stupid by still trying to question this? Either way I know this pain I’m going through cannot be worth it in the end.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/prxa2k/i_cant_get_this_girl_out_of_my_head/

That was the end of the interaction, it went pretty good and I thanked her for being honest and not just ghosting me.

40,prxpnc,1632153414,"Is it okay if the guy I'm seeing checks my IG stories, but doesn't respond to my texts on WhatsApp?","Okay, so long story.. 
I have met a guy (let's call him N) on Tinder back in July 2019. Back then, I met him casually. I informed him the same. We had a good convo but that's all. Later on, I fell in love with someone else and I fell into depression after the breakup. So, while N was texting me even until Dec 2019, I couldn't really respond properly. I understand I haven't been the best person back then. I told him that I was going thru a bad time and can't talk. 

In 2020, N tried to contact me. But I kinda seen zoned him.. now in 2021, he texted me again.. and this time, I am mentally doing much better. Seeking therapy. Healing. So, I thought I would talk to him properly.

I asked him why he texted me and he said he was talking about fashion sense and I have the best fashion sense among the girls he has known. He wanted to show my ig to his frnds. But I blocked him from my ig a year ago. (He didn't do anything, I was mentally not in a great place and was paranoid about guys who I wasn't talking to at the moment).

Anyway I unblocked him. Called him and talked to him. Realized that he was sweet back then too. So, I apologized for unintentionally hurting him. 

Now comes the interesting part. I felt some kinda spark and let him know. Asked him if he's seeing anyone else..he said no. I asked him if we could get to know each other.

After this convo, we kinda talked for five days and nights. I was sleepless, but u understand the initial dopamine hits. It was going great. Now, N has this intense eye contact thingy on vid calls. It kinda makes me hot for him.. and I know he's physically attracted to me too. It was very evident on the vid call. He asked me if we could get onto a sex vid chat. But due to my past (had narcissistic partners.. was traumatized), I have trust issues. I didn't want to. But I was horny. See, this is where it got very confusing. He didn't completely push me. But anyway, me being the people pleaser, did it anyway.

Since the day after that, he was kinda busy. I freaked out. I thought now he doesn't want me or he has taken me for granted. Why? He's not texting or calling me like he usually does. So, I was disappointed. I threw a tantrum and told him that it wouldn't work out. I am a straightforward person. So I told him it's triggering me. He explained it's just a busy day. 

Two days later, he was giving some exams..so he said he was preparing for them.. listen, I understand.. but do you guys really think there wouldn't be any time to call me if he's interested at all? I'm really confused. Him having exams is legit. But him not calling me all these days was again triggering. So, I told him I don't trust him and if I have to trust him, he has to be consistent.

He said I shouldn't blame him just because he didn't talk to me for a few days. He understands why I have trust issues and where I'm coming from. He said once the exams are over, he would be able to talk like how he used to earlier.

Now, my question is, if I'm interested in someone, I would at least make time for them to check upon them, ask them how their day is..
He replies to my texts checking upon him, asking him if he had food, etc etc,
Tmrw is his exam. And he's checking my ig stories. But he would say he doesn't have time to call me

47,prz4yf,1632157694,Person I've been dating made me feel shitty about sex,"I'm having a rough time today and my confidence is a little shaken. I (24F) have been seeing someone (25M) for about 3 months. We first met in person and then had to stop for a while for covid reasons but still talked the entire time. We recently started meeting in person again, and then finally hooked up last week. Most of our talks had been more relationship focused and not specifically about sex, although it was discussed. When we had sex, I stayed the night and we got food the next morning before he drove me home. We decided to go out again, still texted everyday, and then suddenly he started fading me. I followed up with him a few days before we were supposed to go out again to see if he was still interested and he said he was, but I was pretty sure he wasn't based on how distant he had become. I went ahead and met up with him anyway without really having any expectations because he was no longer showing much interest.

Obviously my suspicions were correct -- which would have been totally fine if he had just told me when I asked! He tried to hook up with me again, and after I declined sex I mentioned that he had become distant and I was didn't really know what to think anymore. He kid of evaded the question and then said he was over dating and essentially looking for a FWB situation because of things going on in his life, which I kind of expected, but it was a complete flip from how he had acted previously so it kind of sucked. It stung but wouldn't have been the end of the world until he then started critiquing the sex, asking why I ""don't do"" certain acts/positions and started listing things off. I told him I actually do like to do most of those things, but that I just wasn't comfortable doing everything all in one night the first time with someone new (I also mentioned that a lot of the things he brought up I totally would have been down for if he had just *asked*). He then repeatedly mentioned that I don't give oral since I didn't do it the first night, even though I kept saying that I do, but that again, I don't normally do it unless I know it's not just casual sex due to past experiences and that I would never expect to receive without reciprocating. Now I feel pretty shitty for even sharing any of that with him because he was pretty judgmental about it and it's really personal for me. It's okay to not be sexually compatible, but I'm really not down for shaming people for their preferences. Obviously I should have communicated better so I could have known to avoid sleeping with him in the first place, so lesson learned I guess.

When I got up to go home he mentioned that he was still down for a FWB situation, which I thought was funny since he was just informing me of all the ways I failed at sex, but hey. Even if I had been down for casually hooking up I would have no interest in doing it with him again since he made me feel like absolute shit for not performing to his standard (past partners have never complained like this). I also paid for dinner (which I was okay with since he paid last time) but I paid for lyft too which ended up being really expensive that night so I spent like $100 overall just to be told something he could have texted me when I first asked him what was going on/if he was still interested. To be clear, I have no problem with people who are just looking for casual hookups or ""situationships,"" but it's just not my thing. It just sucked that I invested 3 months of time dating someone who suddenly treated me like I was an annoyance who somehow also owed him all kinds of sex on the first night. Has anyone else had a similar experience? I'm feeling pretty burned out on dating and kind of want to just crawl under a rock right now.

55,przpmn,1632159422,I (23m) am scared that I may not love my (24f) girlfriend anymore.,"So I have recently been really struggling with the idea that I may not have the same feelings for my gf as she has for me and I'm terrified of the idea of breaking up.

We met in Oct 2019 on Tinder and immediately hit it off. She was just so easy to speak to and I just felt so relaxed being around her. We both smoked weed and loved dogs and that really was what brought us together initially. Our first date was to the dog park where we just had a picnic. We ended up hooking up our second date and pretty much started seeing each other most days from then on. 

This was great during peak of covid with regards to restrictions as we could spend a lot of time together,but it caused both of us to slip up with our other relationships and become codependent to a degree. We're at the point where we basically can't go a single night apart without lots of I miss yous and I love yous.

I started feeling a bit overwhelmed and I started pull back from her a bit, being less keen to make out and have intimacy but still showing and telling her that I love and care about her, which made me begin to doubt whether or not I really do and whether or not it's right for me to be with someone who I am not 100% sure of. 

I convinced myself that this isn't the case as we do work really well together when it comes to day to day things like organizing chores and we still pull eachother aside for a smooch when we get the chance. We have the same view of not having kids and shared our opinion on marriage. We both are pretty left leaning and are agnostic about religion. Her family is Jewish though but mostly in culture and basically use Jewish holidays as an excuse to eat/get together which I am happy to have been included in. 

We have had some friction before as she has a highly anxious dog which needs care from my gf pretty much every day. This I was prepared for because her mother or brother could usually help out here and there before covid. But since the lock down both of them can't really help look after Sprout (the dog) as much. Sprout while incredibly cute, is leash aggressive and territorial so walks are a massive pain  and inviting people over is pretty much always a no-no. We have seen a dog behaviorist togethee and are working on helping her calm down but it's a long process which we can't be sure will be successful either. 

Another point is that I feel like we have very little along the lines of common interests and that most of our conversations just end up being about people she knows.  She doesn't care for any media books/music/TV save for reality TV and the rare movie I find that slighy tickles her fancy. So I usually end up making a few suggestions before either sitting and watching some version of the bachelor with her or watching my own thing on my laptop. We were both into the outdoors but with Sprout struggling on lead we rarely go out anymore as my gf feels bad about leaving Sprout at home, even when she would be fine for a few hours. 

When we met, I was just finishing up uni and had loads of free time, but have had to now find work and have been working a 9-5 to support myself(parents live 6 hours away) while she is a full time student who stays at her mother's apartment and is dependent on her mother to get/make food and for any other monetary needs. I've never been bothered by our differences in schedule/responsibility.

Important context is that my girlfriend also struggles with depression and anxiety which I understand makes life very difficult in ways that are extremely hard to explain. I have been supportive of her whenever she feels like everything is too much. And try to take responsibilities off her plate when she needs as much as I can.

I feel like everything nowadays is hard, are we gonna order food or make it. Drive to my place or stay at hers, every single decision is a mountain to cross and I feel like I've gotten to the point where I feel like she is dependant on me for any sort of entertainment. I understand anxiety makes even small decisions hard but I feel like a bit like a caretaker at points, trying to get her to decide on the tiniest things.

Recently we talked about moving in together when she graduates. This will solve a few issues as we would no longer constantly have the up and down between our apartments and Sprout can have a garden where she can hopefully be a bit more relaxed. We also would potentially have a better sex life by the fact we wouldn't be sharing with family/strangers anymore. But I'm scared that if we move in together she'll be even more dependent on me for everything. Her mother said she would support her for 5 months after graduating so that she could use the time to find a job. This support includes money towards the rent she would be sharing with me. Now I understand that I'm in a better off position Financially so I wouldn't expect her to pay 50/50. But she shows no signs of ambition or passion towards her art and career which makes me worry about her actually finding work out of university. Which would mean that after those 5 months I would likely become the sole income for us.

I know this is speculation but I can't help but worry as we need to rent a more expensive place in order for us to be able to have the pooch around.

All these stresses and my own self doubt has once again  led to me feeling a bit distant with her, I pull back slightly when we kiss and I don't always feel like making out before going to sleep. My anxiousness also is affecting our sex life , as I can't have sex with someone if I feel like I'm lying about being in love. My SO however seems still deeply in love with me but I can't shake these feelings of doubt I have. I don't want to hurt her as she is so incredibly special to me, we both have only dated one other person

I know this is more me just organizing my thoughts but I would appreciate any advice yall have. I will be having a heart to heart with her soon either way.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/przpmn/i_23m_am_scared_that_i_may_not_love_my_24f/

Ten minutes, when we are actually inside the attraction,  one of them ran up behind and asked me for my number. I gave it to her   and she text me later that night saying that she'd love to meet up with me when I'm in Paris. We've been chatting in a friendly way on social media ever since.

I (37F pansexual) am recently single (about 2 months) and started creating profiles on dating apps. I am not looking for anything serious right now, maybe a FWB. A friend (37M) of a friend contacted me on Facebook (he probably saw my profiles online) and we started chatting. We texted A LOT every day for like 2 weeks and things got a little intense. Sending nudes and stuff. Also, there was some talk about eventually being in a polyamourous relationship (I was clear I am not ready yet). He was sweet and saying things like ""I want us to live together someday"", ""we should travel together"", etc...

Then we scheduled a ""date"" at my place. It was a bit awkward at first, because we kind of got hyped from our discussions online and we didn't know how to translate it IRL. After a while, things lead to another and we had sex. It was not the best sex ever, but it was nice. I could tell he either was not very experienced or maybe really nervous. I didn't mind, I know there could be an adjustment period. After the sex he rolled over (turning his back on me) and fell asleep. Since we both had trouble sleeping, we kept waking up. I tried to cuddle a few times, but he didn't seem to enjoy it. In the morning, he left super early. Gave me a hug and no kiss. I said something like ""I'm glad we did this, I hope I see you again soon"" and he replied he wouldn't have much time from now on. I know he has a new business deal, so I understand that he will be busy. Since then he barely answers my texts(from 100 to 0 in a few hours seems extreme even if you're busy) I'm not asking for a lot, just for him to tell me if he still wants to see me sometimes or I should forget it. I tried asking him in a text and he said he had a good time with me and he likes me, but it went too fast. I don't know what that means and he didn't want to explain. I made sure to get consent from him before doing anything.

I had a thought that maybe he was a virgin or really inexperienced, but how would I have known if he didn't tell me? What do you think I did wrong? Anyway I wanted to tell my story, because I'm sure I missed some red flags that you can point out and I don't know what to do next (with him and/or other people).

I have absolutely 0 experience when it comes to dating, and I'm sure I'm horrible to read human signals. Because I honestly don't know if he even feel slightly the same way about me as I do about him. He is way out of my league!

I'm new in this company, and this guy is one of my co-workers, but we are (normally) working on two different locations. So we don't see each other often. Whenever we do happen to work in the same office, he's the nicest person. He makes me feel comfortable and is very caring towards me. Most importantly he always make me smile.

But we've only ever met in working-related situations. Idk if he's nice to me because I'm his co-worker or because he cares about me.

I was getting my covid jab one morning and went to work afterwards. He came by my desk asking how it went. Honest as I am, I told him that I, in a hurry, forgot to eat breakfast, and was feeling a little off after getting the shot. But that I was feeling much better now, showing him the apple I've taken from the lunch room. After asking me several times if he could get my anything else, aka. some ""real"" food, I kindly declined the offer and ensured him that I was feeling alright. Which I was; I wasn't hungry and I'm in no way needy.

He came by my desk numerous times that day, and asked me if I was doing ok. I've never had someone care that much for me after getting a little jab with a needle, lol. And I did like seeing him smiling in the doorway every hour. Gosh, I feel like a teenager...

He has also been taking me flying a couple of times in the company's helicopter. I have a deep fear of flying but somehow he talked me into doing it. He acknowledged my fear and talked me through almost everything in the dashboard. And being in the air was brilliant. Seeing him so calm doing what he loves the most, made me feel calm too. He always jokes around telling me if I ever need to arrive in style somewhere, I should just call and he will bring the helicopter, haha.

We've never talked about private stuff, and I don't even know if he's already dating someone. I honestly just wanna get to know him more, but the distance makes it difficult, along with the only occasional visits at each other's departments.

So, we have gone on 2 dates, he seems really respectful and we talk all the time, tho only been dating for a month. After our last date, he invited me over and I agreed as long as he didn't think it meant I would be having sex. He said no it's fine he just wants to hang out longer. Well 2 hours in, we have our first kiss on the couch and 30 min later on the bed getting really hot and heavy. He insinuated having sex but I told him no, that I don't know him well enough to be that intimate yet. He said he completely understood and after a few more kisses I decided to leave. He then texted me in the morning as usual.

I am not the type of guy to cry over any girl that doesn't give me any attention. I don't smother any girl with compliments or gifts or act needy towards any girl over text. I won't pounce and instant reply to any text from any girl.

We both have the same hobby so we have something in common. We never go on a date. She tells me she isnt interested. Okay easy right? Well... we talk on and off. Mostly on instagram and she tells me she isnt interested again. Fair enough. But then again we talk after not talking... as if something keeps drawing us in? I usually just react to her story on IG which starts the convo but sometimes she starts it, ill be honest with yall, I like this girl alot, I think guys can understand me, I cant help but want to talk to her. She is the kind of girl that makes you excited when she texts you. She is kind, cute, and the most beautiful girl I have ever met. When I'm on go in dates, I cant help but want to talk to her instead. After all, we do get along well. Many of yall will say that I never met her so I dont know her, and I agree, I cant explain it but i dont think I'm alone when it comes to this situation.
Anyways... I should clarify, I never push her into going out or anything (infact she asked me on a date but then canceled a week before bc she said she wasnt interested), she usually just gets stressed bc of her work and such and tells me she isnt interested. She has given me many reasons. But she keeps coming back... and I keep getting excited when she does, making it worse when she leaves. She also leaves me on read alot...
Anyways I know what I have to do... I have to get over her. That requires me deleting her in social media but that's hard. My gut keeps telling me that she likes me.
Here is something odd, she liked my profile picture that is a month old at 4am in the morning 2 days ago. She isnt abroad. She lives in my home town. And then yesterday we had another phone convo. 
I dont think she is playing games with me. I think she is more conflicted... main issue with me is that I'm a med student out of state, which means we would be long distant. At least that's what my gut keeps telling me. She knows my intention and my feelings, I made it very clear. I think she likes me but at this point I'm afraid to ask her. Idk guys and girls. 

It just sucks bc I really like this girl and genuinely want to get to know her and date her and have some future with her but I think my heart is clouding my judgement. And my gut feeling keeps telling me conflicting things.

Can anyone explain why she liked my photo at 4am?

I told him I’ve never had a boyfriend before and that’s me trying to hint that I’ve never had these experiences.

I wanna be able to flirt without it being awkward or forced because it just doesn’t come out smooth. I want to show him I am interested but having no experience and not being use to a guys affection or attention is VERY new to me. When my friends tell me to say flirty stuff through text, I back out in cause it’s not received well or I just feel like cringe or it’s too much. He says he’s interested in me or getting to know me but I don’t know what he wants. I don’t have any story to tell him or any childhood experience that made me as a person. My life has always been positive for the most part. I know he would like to just know me but I never know what to say. I just want to show him I’m interested too but the cringe takes over. I also think about just being completely honest, and telling him that what I mean by I never had a boyfriend means I have never had any experiences of the talking stage or anything. So when he flirts with me and I’m like quiet doesn’t mean I’m not feeling you it’s just a whole different environment I have to get comfortable in.

82,ps1z6b,1632166371,Should I tell him that I like him or is it a bad idea based on the background info?,"So there's this weird dynamic going on between me and my friend that I'm not sure how to handle.

I've known him for 2 years since we are in college and last fall we got closer, socializing more and more through social media during distance mode.

This Summer in June, he asked me out for lunch. I couldn't attend but was quick to reschedule. We went out and played golf instead which was fun. I also got to meet his friend and they were nice.

A couple of weeks later we went out for drinks to play pool. Also had fun.

Some days later I went for a walk and messaged him if he wanted to go for a walk. He responded super fast and was like sure. And then we walked until I had to pee and he was like you can pee at my place I live nearby, so went to his place to pee lmao 

I had to travel out of town and he also traveled out of town but we stayed in touch the whole weekend. I was snapchatting him, and he answered kind of in the same vein. If I sent a selfie with some text, he sent a selfie with almost the same text. Was kind of funny. We have then been out for drinks and playing pool again. And through our Snapchat conversation, I've kinda hinted that he is a guy with good looks and that he is smart. I jokingly call him ""the hunk"" sometimes. Last month he sent me a couple of selfies asking me which ones to use for his social media and I said I'm really bad at choosing stuff like that and that he should maybe ask another female friend to get a better judgement and he was like ""nope asking you, you're the only one I feel comfortable asking""

He also works part time at a bar nearby where I live, and once I asked him what he was up to late friday night through text and he answered saying he was at the bar having a couple of drinks. And then he was like out of the blue asking are you coming? Which sadly I couldn't attend.

However here is the deal. I've been on several dates this summer with two different guys that didn't lead to anything, and he knows about it since we've talked about it. Strangely he never brings up his dating life like I do. He never speaks about other specific women in conversations with me. I don't even know what his type is. I was complaining about this guy rejecting my date proposal and he was like ""you should ask him to go out for drinks and play pool"" with a laughing smiley. We've talked about Tinder and how it sucks for dating and he was like ""you have a better personality than most women on Tinder"" when I was telling him that maybe I have a bad/weird personality and thats why I struggle with dating.

Honestly I don't really know what this friendship is about. I feel like there's a weird dynamic going on here, its bordering between friendship and something more. But then I feel like if he wanted more than friendship he would have made that known by now, by asking me out on a proper date or inviting him over to his place.

84,ps25ui,1632166922,Weird ex still sending you messages?,"Why do men do this? This guy and I got along really well, hung out, went on fun adventures…I really had nothing against the guy. We never even really dated, we went on a few “dates” and usually just ended up having really great sex. We did the hookup thing Over the course of like a year and a half. 

We actually only kind of parted ways during the initial lockdown, when, because it was strict here for a few months and people were being ticketed, and things we closed, we never had the opportunity to hang out. So anyway, he finds a gf and gets her pregnant, and because we never really dated I didn’t care very much. A few snarky words to friends, but I certainly never gave him a hard time about it. 

Anyway,I happened to leave something of value (2k) at his house for months during the pandemic, assuming that as long as we were on lockdown I wouldn’t go try to retrieve it, and thinking it wouldn’t be a problem to just get it back. It took a year, and eventually had to threaten police intervention. 

Obviously this escalated into me yelling back and forth to get my stuff back (which I have no idea why he was holding against its will anyway lol, it was of no use to him), so we ended up parting as not friends. He messaged me on like every platform available saying I was sick and needed help (because I got angry I guess?) and this was like, April….so now he has a new phone I suppose because I just got another message from him saying “I hope you got the help you need…”

Like, is he just mad that I got pissed and threatened him with police to get my stuff back? Why do they always need to come back for one more haunt haha

He has a new baby, and a permanent baby mama…why is he still pissed at me? Why mysteriously message me and make me track down who sent the message lol

87,ps2apr,1632167333,Mixed Signals,"So I (26M) went on a date with this girl (25F) a couple of weeks ago and things went very well. We covered the basic coffee table talk and quickly moved into the more in depth questions and it seemed like we understood and saw eye to eye on a lot of things.

She then invited me to go to brunch with her a few days later and that also went well. We smiled, we laughed and we enjoyed each other’s company and I made the move to kiss her which she later told me she was glad I did.

Since then, I have tried to follow up and make plans to spend more time with her to which she says she’s “just so busy these days”, and the truth is she probably is! She is a critical care nurse and I’m aware and considerate of what her occupation requires of her. She has told me that she wants to spend time with me when she can.

As of recently, since I have been left on read, I’ve given her plenty of space and time and decided to let her reach out to me when she wants to. Where my signals become mixed is when she posted “If you don’t want to see me with anyone else, then treat me like there is nobody else made for me.”

91,ps2wv9,1632169164,"Girlfriend and I have gotten into many arguments about Feminist/Gender Issues and it's putting a strain on the relationship, is this a red flag to break it off? (26M, 26F)","Disclaimer, I want to say my GF is not a representation of all women who identify as feminist. I get along with most feminist in my real life and I have dated feminist in the past with no issues.

I've been dating my current GF for 8 months, it was great. We have similar sense of humor, personality, common interest, and it was a pretty easy going relationships.

She's a feminist, into feminist studies and issues and it was not a problem. I would identify as a feminist since I believed in equals rights and opportunity.

Then one day my GF asked me a question, she was telling me about how women being harassed and assaulted in subway trains at night time and asked me what I personally think a solution to prevent that would be. I told her that I think it would be a good idea to add security guards in the trains and maybe that would prevent some assaults. She suddenly got mad at me telling me ""you're such a typical guy with surface level solutions, and not attacking the root of the real problem, instead of expecting women to be protected, or to protect themselves, why not teach men not to rape or assault women""

And I was a bit confused at first that she got so upset, I told her that I agree with her, teaching men about consent is a good thing, but if she's asking me what's the solution to attacks, my first instinct isn't going to be about the background of the attacker and how he was raised. I tried explaining that I'm a minority myself, and I've experience racist attacks, and even though I think it's a good thing to teach children about not being racist, there's aways going to be people who don't learn, so even though teaching children about consent or racism is a good thing, and I support that, I just figured having a solution for the people who fall through the cracks isn't a bad thing either, I think we can do both. It lead to an argument, I even tried apologizing, but eventually she said ""just forget it"" and we didn't speak on it.

Then another day my GF was telling me a story about how a guy who asked her out many years ago, and when she told him no, he grabbed her arm doing that ""come on baby don't be a tease"" thing, and she was telling me how she felt violated and unheard during that experience. Then she told me ""I wish you could understand where I'm coming from, I you could understand what that's like, even a little bit, just 1%, but you don't understand so I feel alone talking to you about it""

Then I told her that I did understand, that I myself was raped in prison, and that I understand what it's like to be violated, to feel powerless. I told her that I understand that as a guy, out in the streets I don't have to worry about it as much as she does as a woman, so I won't have the same exact experience as a woman, but that I was sympathetic towards her struggles and I never want her to feel alone or not understood when she opens up to me about these things, that I could at least offer her that little bit of understanding she wishes I had. (She knew I went to prison for about a year when I was 18, but she didn't know I got raped)

And then she just said ""Well it's not the same, you got raped by another man, and it's men who are causing this problem, so it's just men attacking other men"" and I couldn't' believe she just threw that at my face like that. It took a lot for me to also open up and tell her that, and she didn't have an ounce of sympathy for me.

Then an argument that happened a couple of days ago was she brought up the train argument again about me being a bad feminist or bad ally, and asking me why I'm being so difficult, telling me I'm an asshole just like all men. Then I told her I think it's unfair for her to label all men as assholes, she started mocking me ""Aww, does hearing those words make you sad, are you gonna cry like little baby?"" and I told her that it's a really weird thing for her to say since she's said in the past that men should be more vulnerable and that vulnerable men shouldn't be infantilized, and she kept going on about how I'm gonna cry like a baby, at this point I just left, and we haven't spoken in days.

It's really weird because she wasn't like this at all when we met and for all this time until recently I don't know if it's that her true nature is coming out, or maybe something happened to her recently that's making her act this way. What's weird is our arguments are pointless since we technically agree with everything. Is this a red flag? Should I just break up with her and cut things off from now on? for the last month I feel I have to walk on eggshells around her to not upset her or say the wrong thing.

TLDR;

\- Dating girl for 7 months

\- Asked me what I thought a solution should be to prevent women being harassed in trains, I suggested security guards, she got mad because I didn't suggest teaching men not to rape.

\- She was telling me a bad experience of hers when she told a guy NO and he kept going, told me she wishes I understood what it was like, when I told her I was raped, she said it doesn't count because it's a guy raping another guy

\- She says men should be more vulnerable, and vulnerable men shouldn't be infantilized, but when we argued she using shaming languages ""Gonna cry, like a baby?""

The opinion seems to be that if you, for any reason, exclude any group of people from your dating pool (especially if it's over something they can't control)  that means you're a bad or terrible person.  


It's like people seem to be conflating desirability with self worth or respect. Like, they believe that if a person doesn't want to date/spend the rest of their life with a subset of people that means that that person clearly thinks poorly of that subset of people.     
And that mindset is just weird to me.          
There's a big difference in saying I'm not really attracted to XYZ people and All XYZ people are ugly, bad, and/or stupid!    

Like, I'm a heterosexual woman, and while I see beautiful, strong, and successful women often I'm in no way whatsoever attracted to them and I don't think they are inferior in any capacity.  
Furthermore, every single day I work with, admire, and enjoy the company of people I would literally NEVER consider for a relationship but I don't think any less of them just because I wouldn't date them. I don't think they are inferior, I'm just not attracted to them or know we aren't compatible.       


Shouldn't people be uber selective in finding a partner who they, assumingly, will be spending the rest of their lives with?
