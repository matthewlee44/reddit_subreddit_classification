4,rb8jcg,1638908572,Men's dating from the perspective of a fashion model.," This is a comment posted by Reddit user [u/ccadann](https://www.reddit.com/u/ccadann/). She is a fashion model who works at one of the most well known agencies in the world. I decided to repost her comment because I think she offers a great perspective on seduction and dating for men, and she talks about the kinds of guys her and her friends (who are also models) date which I think should be heard by every guy who thinks ""you can only get attractive women if you're handsome"". She also talks about what has worked for her, and how to meet models.

Without further ado, enjoy!

**CCADANN'S WORDS**

""I stumbled across this reddit forum and was intrigued reading through mens thoughts on picking up women. I saw this post and thought i'd offer an alternative perspective. I've worked as a model for one of the biggest modeling agencies (IMG) starting from my preteens, I am in my twenties now. My friends and I are all in the entertainment industry (modeling, acting, singing) our faces have become well known, but we frequently get approached by random men even if they don't know who we are. One of the biggest mistakes I see from men is the feeling they have to do something big/bold/obnoxious to get a woman's attention. Most of the guys try to be extra masculine or try to be flashy showing their expensive car keys/name drop something- this doesn't work at all. Or atleast not for the girls you want to date long term, yes some girls will be excited by ferrari car keys, but the rest of us do very well for ourselves and tend to prefer someone who likes to be low key too.

Being approached very often, I prefer if a man takes a soft/non aggressive route. Say hi the same way you would to one of your friends. It puts everyone at ease. The more relaxed you are, the more natural the conversation feels. Crack a joke if you think somethings funny, smile, use a soft regular voice, if the woman is sitting try to sit down at the same eye level as her so you aren't domineering.

Stay clean cut, trimmed, clean your nails, use a few sprays of a nice cologne, all the basic simple things. Dress nice, but comfortable. Women can tell if you aren't used to wearing a suit, if it's not you don't do it. Cover these basics before you approach a normal girl or a supermodel.

2 of my bestfriends are models for Victoria's Secret, you would never pick their boyfriends out of the room. The guys are not the most attractive, but they make my friends laugh and like they can relax. They both started paying attention to the guys because they were very personable and made them laugh from the beginning. Not a standup comedy routine, just real things they thought were funny and the humor matched.

I feel the same way about it. My boyfriend is shorter than me and Middle Eastern (I'm very blonde with light eyes) people wouldn't peg us together if we weren't sitting together, but when we are in the same space we only have eyes for each other. He makes me laugh like no one else and is unwaveringly loyal. I literally treasure our relationship. I wouldn't cheat or even flirt with other men out of my respect to the relationship. If you can find the courage to be yourself and not put on a routine you can form a relationship even with someone well known, but drop the act they teach you to approach with. The movie ""She's Out of My League"" is actually pretty accurate. I know a lot of beautiful women that would prefer a skinny less attractive guy that cracks them up over a muscled up male model who doesn't give a shit about them.

Most of my friends and I are pretty casual on our off duty days- no makeup, jeans, sneakers. I think for guys who are shy about meeting women this may actually make it easier to approach. Change the framework of what you are taught to look for day to day. The fresh faced pretty girl grabbing a smoothie in jeans and sneakers is going to dress up beautifully when she chooses too. Lots of guys seem to look for the dolled up glam barbie parading around during the day, but the girls I know like that are pretty high maintenance. The beautiful women I know that are the most good natured and ready for long term relationships have the confidence to go around the day fresh faced. And unlike most people would probably stereotype we are probably the most polite, friendliest people you'll meet on the street. Natural beauty a lot of times manifests inwards, the look we were born with is not something we take for granted so if someone has the courage to talk to us we genuinely want to leave your day brighter than we found it. So don't judge a book by its cover when approaching, but run if you talk to a woman and you get bitchy vibes. It probably won't get better.

Daytime stuff is definitely the easiest way to meet someone in my friend group. We go to lots of wellness related places (smoothie shops, workout classes, spas, etc.) coffee shops, fun art events like Kusama's infinity room. Develop your own passion for taking care of yourself (if its something that interests you) and you'll find yourself in a lot more spaces with attractive self-confident women. That's going to be the most organic way to meet one of us-romantically or as a friend. When we do the nightlife/dinner scene we end up pretty isolated. Dinner is normally in a private room or restaurants used to celebrities coming in so that people aren't constantly approaching, at clubs it's normally a section thats not easily accessible.

Some of these techniques for seduction are funny. A lot of guys seem to over think it. If the goal is to sleep with as many women as possible then get a nice sports car and the type of girls that want flash over who you are will be available. They may not be the best quality, but they'll be there. If you want a chance with beautiful, famous or women who you can genuinely be with for a long time then make them laugh and feel at ease with you. Take sex off the table as your main goal. If 99 men approach you a day all with the idea of sleeping with you, then the 1 different one will be the 1 who approaches not just trying to get you in bed. If she likes you and you like her, you'll get to the bedroom either way, but if it's at the main forefront of your mind you''ll likely strike out much sooner.

Good luck out there!

12,rb8rcf,1638909157,Long Distance &amp; lost.,"Me: (20/F) - Him: (23/M)

We are long distance rn. I last went to see him last month and I might be seeing him after/“for” Christmas. We are not in a official relationship just talking stage for the last 2 years.

When it comes to me making poor decisions such as: 

- Sleeping in (when I have almost nothing urgent to do..) 
- waiting or taking until the last minute to leave for work, (or when it tangibly/generally benefits him/us)
- Going to the gym at night 
- Speeding (yet he does this whenever he drives my car, and still now, knowing it already needs to be fixed) 

The other day I was told that I am capping with my actions regarding bettering myself, and everything coming out of my mouth was bullshit when my actions don’t match my words. That is true

What I had said that day was: “I’m doing this for me” , after stating how I wasn’t happy about being late that day. This regarding me working to be more consistent and disciplined. That doesn’t mean every single day will be perfect. I’m not perfect. 

Because I was getting to work at the last minute that day he went on a speech of how I always wait til the last minute and how I’m stressing and overexerting myself for a job that doesn’t mean shit because it’s not a “real job”. And that by the time I get a real job I’ll just continue to fuck up if I don’t manage my time well enough. 

He always has some type of logic in what he says, but his delivery leaves my feelings hurt each time. And I believe that is how it will always be with him. Because that is how he is. I’ve told him his many times in the last 2 years of being involved that I don’t like/appreciate the way his tone usually is with me. 

And then he has moments where he does talk to me sweetly. He told me not to feel like I can’t ever speak on how I feel about anything he’s said or done. 

It’s just whenever I mess up or am not being perfect I am lectured on it. But anything positive or an achievement to me is never spoken on. I am always TOLD to be better more than encouraged. And if this is his way of encouragement I would have to get used to it. 

There’s some things he does that I could speak on and he will either say he doesn’t give af, might tell me to mind my business, or ask me “how” and I’m just sure it wouldn’t run out well. Because I don’t speak on anything low of him. But I do try to acknowledge the good things and get dry thank you’s.

I’ve never been in a real relationship and it seems like this is all that I will have because I want to grow with someone and I wanted it to be him… this really hurts me. 

TL;DR - My (20/F) S/O (23/M) emphasizes my lows but never speaks on my highs.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rb8rcf/long_distance_lost/

We only had 1 night together and it was amazing as far as I can remember. 

Flash forward 5 years, I (23) work and study in the US. I regularly do my work at coffee shops and such. Unknowingly I order my coffee from her. Skipping the simple greeting exchanges, she says she knows my brother from school? I ask here how she knows and then she reveals that she knew my brother’s friends. 

I still did not know that she was the same person I met 5 years ago but after talking with my brother on the phone I finally realized.  I stood there in disbelief for a little bit before approaching her. I ask her out thinking how miraculous it is that two people could meet again over 5 years time. I seriously thought that I would have the same feelings 5 years ago!

She replied with “sorry, I am gay”.  I said “cool” and left the cafe.

Any Advice on Dating For Someone With Severe Mental Illness?,"I suffer from severe mental illness which has made dating really hard. I've been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, anxiety, and complex PTSD. The last few years have been hell. I've been in and out of psychiatric facilities, had legal troubles, and generally been unable to function or hold down a job. I'm really happy to say that I've found a regimen of medication that works for me and gone back to school. People tell me that I am attractive and plenty of girls have asked me out or shown interest over the course of my life. Sometimes I use tinder and I get matches, but the app generally seems like a scam.  For instance when I pay I instantly get matches but few without paying.  It also just hurts. Last night I was talking with a girl on there and we really vibed.  Now she is ghosting me. I have serious abandonment issues that make dating hard and online communication even worse. When they take too long to reply I just assume I'm being ghosted again. I once had two dates lined up in a week and they both stood me up. I desperately want to meet someone irl but that's hard too given the virus and having to wear a mask at school. 

I genuinely don't know how to approach women and I'm just so nervous around them. I have been told that I show signs of autism spectrum disorder, but they say the diagnosis doesn't totally fit. Generally my strategy when I was younger was to get really drunk at a social event and sometimes a girl would take me home with her. Other than that they have asked me out and done all the work.  Therefore I have no idea what I'm doing. Even when they ask me I still find ways to fuck it up. My abandonment issues make it hard. One time a girl asked me out at work. We had the most beautiful first date I've ever had. At the end we kissed and cuddled for a bit. A few days later I freaked out and blew up her phone and ruined the whole thing. I've only been in one relationship that was very one sided. She wasn't right for me but I didn't want to be alone. That ended in 2017.

42,rbclpp,1638919727,[25M] Need some major advice for my first ever date!,"I'm about to go on my first date by the end of this month during the week of Christmas. 

My mother arranged for me to meet this girl who's the daughter of her friend's from her workplace. The girl's parents also approved of this. 

We're gonna have dinner with them where we'll be in separate tables.

First of all, this will be my first ever social activity in YEARS. I've never been on a date nor ever had a real conversation with a girl in-person since high school. I'm a very awkward and shy person. Wish I could back out on this but our meeting is already planned up. I have no idea what to talk about once we share a table together.

Here's a few things about myself;

\*I work part-time and handle my own business of sorts (I buy and sell collectible figures and others)

\*My interests are anything Marvel/DC-related, wrestling and video games

\*The girl and I are of the same ethnicity (Pinoy)

Also the girl is only staying in the states for the holidays to be with her folks and will head back to the Philippines by January. So it's likely we might end up in a long-distance relationship after our first date.

edit; Also I've thought about getting her something since our date is during the week of Christmas (a friendship bracelet of sorts? or necklace?)

(29M) I met a beautiful woman on this site and we dated for 7 months, she had no job and stayed with her parents. She eventually moved into her own place and I was happy to help her move!! We did everything together, things were great until we had our first argument. After that she wouldn’t let it go! She started being very demanding, it grew more and more toxic. Well it got so bad that a couple of days before I left we argued from Sat 12pm - Sun 11am the next day, which is my nightmare cause I’m non confrontational. The next day I had enough and told her I’m going back to my place for a day to get a break cause I couldn’t convince her to stop. She through herself in-front of the door and wouldn’t let me pass, I tried physically removing her she then told me “If you leave this apartment I’m going to kill myself” I was shocked she would go that far. So I stayed and we stayed quiet all day, until the next morning and she goes off on me for trying to leave her!!! I had enough and grabbed all of my things and headed to the door to again be blocked by her standing at the door and she would scream bloody murder if I tried moving past her. I was stuck in the apartment for another day, I had no choice she kept threatening me she’d harm herself or harm herself and call the police to tell them I beat her. I eventually snuck out with only half my things and just counted my losses.

I’m taking a physiology class as a prerequisite course to get into a program at a different university. So during these virtual zoom meets no one ever really contributes to the lecture. For the most part it seems like students are too shy or just don’t give it much attention since it’s online. A portion of the class is dedicated to discussion where we are supposed to collaborate with other students and discuss material that we had just gone over. Every day we are paired up with random students to ensure we get to discuss with everyone. During these discussions no one is ever talking so it’s usually me trying to initiate conversation and then just sitting there waiting for a response. So one day this student (24F) pops up and starts imitating discussing. Which made me happy! Finally someone who is actually willing to talk. So we begin talking science right  and it just eventually transitions to a normal conversation. It must’ve been a bit awkward for the other couple students given that we were in a group meeting. Anyway, fast forward to a couple weeks later we exchange numbers in order to reach out in case we needed help with class work. We would occasionally help each other but would mostly just talk about future plans, hobbies, etc. Turns out we both graduated from the same college! And we are both taking this class to get into a program. She’s planning on becoming a PA whereas I want to become a CLS. So we both have science backgrounds, share a similar sense of humor, both goal oriented, and more. It just feels natural talking to her. I want to proceed to get to know her better and who knows.

86,rbg78f,1638930354,Should I tell him the truth?,So I met this guy in March of 2019 and we went on a couple of dates probably like 6 or 7. I was head over heels with this guy the moment I laid eyes on him. Probably the closest I’ve ever come to the whole “love at first sight thing”. However even though we got along well something about me always would seem to bother him on some of our dates. I would get so hyper when I was going to see him and when I would spend the night at his place I would barely sleep and he thought I was insane haha. But never the less we would continue going on for a little while. The hardest part really was that I lived about an hour away from him. So we stopped talking for a little while and then would try to hang out here and there but our plans always fell through one way or another. He eventually started dating another girl and I was devastated. So fast forward about a month ago I added him back on social media and he reached out almost instantly. We finally hung out it was amazing. But once again I haven’t heard from him after our date. Should I reach out and just tell him how I really feel?,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rbg78f/should_i_tell_him_the_truth/

92,rbgqri,1638931973,Relationship advice for someone who enjoys being alone,"Hello all,

I (M22) am in a relationship with a great woman (F23). It's been about 9 months, and overall things are good. At first, I thought we were a perfect match. However, over time I have noticed where we differ. Nothing earth shattering, but noteworthy.

I have always preferred to be by myself. At home, driving, going out, hanging out. I'm happiest just being alone and not having to be in a close knit group with others. I have a small circle of friends whom I see once in awhile. I am perfectly social and do occasionally enjoy large groups, I just prefer to worry about myself. I also have a good relationship with my and my gf's family.

However, my girlfriend always wants to spend time with me. I think last week I came over after work every single day of the week. I started to feel a little choked at the end of the week if I am being honest. I definitely enjoy her company and we have a good time. I feel a little bit smothered however as she wants to spend almost every free second with me, doing things, watching movies, blah blah blah. This isn't including the outings we do, we go out on dates and do stuff around town a lot together and those are just heaven, we always have a good time. What I'm talking about in this post is on top of that sort of couple activities we do frequently.

I am a male in my early 20's as stated. I have a lot of stuff going on right now in my life, as I should. I have a career, I am on the cusp of finishing college, and I run a small business. Add on top the holidays, and the fact me and my girlfriend are going on a week vacation to visit her family next week, I'm starting to feel smothered. I'm a young man. I also have my own residence (one about 45 mins away from the room my gf rents and right near my work, the other about an hour away in a major city.) I have to deal with my responsibilities, my work, study, people's orders. It gets exhausting when my girlfriend asks me to come over to her place after work every single day. Additionally, she usually just wants to watch a movie or a show and I rarely get to choose. So I end up spending 4-5 hours after work, driving over, watching a movie, and then slugging home, going to bed right away because I have to be up early for my job and it repeats. I have very minimal time to myself. I feel guilty engaging in my hobbies because I don't want my gf to feel like I'm not giving her attention. But sometimes I just want to enjoy a beer by myself, watching some Top Gear of playing some Halo.

Are these feelings normal? Does it sound right to feel guilty for just wanting some free time to myself? I will invite my girlfriend to my apartment when she says I should come to see her, and instead chill over at my apartment, maybe stay the night so we can wake up together and still enjoy each other's company, but in the rare occurrence when she does come over to me, she is always trying to get us to do stuff together. It's frustrating at times because I don't have time to be snuggling on the couch every night, sometimes I have work to do at home or other things to do. I would be happy if she was okay just coming over and chilling there while we do separate things sometimes, so we can still be around each other and we can fall asleep and wake up together, but that almost never happens. To her, we HAVE to be doing something together all the time, and usually it's watching some show on Netflix I can't engage in or having some cheesy romantic dinner or something out of a rom-com. I want her to be around me, and I want to do the cute couple stuff, but I just wish when I saw her we could just chill and I wouldn't have to worry about going on my computer with my buddies after work, having a beer, or just doing something that doesn't directly involve her or god forbid doing some important stuff I really need to do outside of work hours because she'll comment that ""I'm not spending time with her"" even though I literally invited her over and she's literally standing in my living room, welcome to do whatever the hell she wants. I'm worried my girlfriend might be a bit too clingy. She's very mature about everything else, and I don't mind clinginess in general, but I would rather save that for a few years down the road when things get more serious and we become more dependent on each other. I'm committed to dating her long-term obviously, but I'm a young man. I don't want this stage of my life dominated by my girlfriend and her hobbies. I love her very much, I want her active in my life and she's important to me. But I feel a little choked, a little smothered, and I think I should be able to have more free time or more chill time with my girlfriend at this stage in my life.

Anybody have any thoughts or advice? Any guys go through something similar, any women have any ideas or thoughts on her behavior or my thoughts and reaction?

Thanks! 
Here is more context along with imposter syndrome:

Context: I am in a wheelchair due to spina bifida. 21 year old male.
I’m really struggling with imposter syndrome lately, past, present and future. 
I feel like many people were kind and friendly to me when I was in high school because they felt bad for me or pitied me. This period was when I had the most attention from girls and had several relationships. It all seemed real with them until my first real girlfriend cheated on me right after I graduated. My penis size wasn’t enough and she didn’t like that I was wheelchair bound. It really salted my wounds that I didn’t know existed. 
Present day I struggle immensely with finding friends and any semblance of love. I feel alone and I struggle even reaching out because I don’t want to repeat what happened in the past with friends and a partner.
I’m trying to hard to get past my past but I can’t help thinking I’m stuck in this vicious cycle for life. Dating and friend finder apps suck and it seems like COVID is never going away.

95,rbh1fm,1638932827,Friend group issues F[16],"alright for context Im F[16] and let me just start this off with the fact that I’m going to sound like a terrible person but at least I’m self-aware (not that thats a viable excuse) 

Well. god how do I even start this. I’m one of two females in an all male friendgroup and lets just say I’ve garnered attention I didn’t expect from them. I tend to get swept up by emotions and not think things through properly and thats biting me in the butt now. 

woooo context time: I liked homie A and suspected he liked me back for a couple years before covid hit and I assumed he lost interest in me. Then B popped up and apparently he liked me during that time too, then confessed to me. It may have been the wrong decision but I felt kind of bad and said yes- it wasn’t a complete lie though we were close I just tried to force my feelings for his sake and in the end I didn’t want to lead him on anymore and ended things with him as gently as I could. 

Things were a bit awkward in the group after that but but we’d only dated for a month and nobody really said anything so after some time it was fine. 

Eventually the other girl in the group (my best friend) brought it to my attention that C (who’s one of the guys I was closest to) was starting to show signs of liking me. I didn’t think much of it but eventually we got closer and closer and I caught feelings for him. I really didn’t mean to and tried to push them down, but we’d literally talk everyday and flirt sometimes. Still I didn’t act on the crush I didn’t want to be “that girl” yk. 
This went on for almost a year

woohoooo new schoolyear’s almost starting and now D is getting really close to me. And call me a “not-very-nice-person” but I liked both C and D at the same time. Listen man Ive never had to deal with romantic conflict Im just- ugh anyways. 

I told myself I wasn’t ready for a relationship. Clearly. Im still really young and stupid and obviously don’t know what Im doing I just wanted time to sort my feelings out. 
THEN E asks me out to eat and I like an IDIOT I really thought it was friendly. He’d confessed to me a year and a bit before but I genuinely thought he was over those feelings now. Anyways. E told D about this and that just made D act faster. He asked me out to the movies and we had a nice time but he didn’t try any moves so I just idk thought I misunderstood???

Ive been second guessing myself the entire time about any of these guys actually liking me, and well. I wont pull up the whole wah wah sob story but I’m insecure as fuck and clearly cant handle attention well 

Now D asks me to hangout really frequently and yeah I like him but I’m conflicted. I liked C for much longer but went along anyways because I like D too right??? [I am a fucking idiot.]

At this point everyone already assumes we’re dating and then boom. He asks me to be his girlfriend. 

and i
say 
yes. 

:| 


Something Ive now realized is I have MASSIVE FUCKING COMMITMENT ISSUES 
and just like B a month has now passed and I am rethinking me and D’s relationship. 

Thing is these are all my friends and I care about them alot and it scares the fuck out of me that I’m responsible for so many people’s feelings. 

I would never cheat on him. That is just a despicable thing to do. But i’m going to be be completely honest I still have feelings for A and C. moreso than my own boyfriend. and that makes me feel soso awful

he’s so sweet and tells me how in love he is with me- I cant breakup with him it just hurts so much and I feel guilty all day because theres nothing I can do. and its all my fault so I really have no right to complain. 

I don’t know what to do I can’t break up with him and even if I do theres no way in hell I’ll try and pursue anyone else. I just don’t know what to do and I don’t want to lose my friends (I’m scared they’ll kick me out - understandably so)

Why’d I have to get ahead of myself and only realize now I am just not ready for a relationship. 

fuck. 


TLDR: A bunch of guys in my friend group have liked and like me and I don’t know how to deal with my own feelings. I don’t know what to do- I care about them and I don’t want to lose or hurt my friends.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rbh1fm/friend_group_issues_f16/

We really clicked and I gave him my number. We texted consistently and he asked me out a couple of days later. We had what I thought was a really wonderful date. He was so sweet and assuring the whole time and when we texted afterward he said he wanted to see me again. The next day he went in for his shift in the Coast Guard. We talked a little that day but not much, though I know he can't really be on his phone much when he's there. He was supposed to have gotten off yesterday, but I haven't heard from him at all.

99,rbhdlz,1638933788,Thoughts on Unfollowing Your Ex on Social Media?,"I  (29F) am a little over 2 months out from a breakup with a 29M. We only dated for 3 months but during that time I think we spend a lot of time getting to know each other on dates. I met his siblings, friends, coworkers. We never fought. He very abruptly broke up with me and I was devastated. About a week after the breakup we had a closure talk and things ended ok. Afterwards, I noticed he didn't unadd me on his IG which felt a bit odd since he was the one doing the dumping. I tried to be mature and also keep him as a ""friend"" on there (I'd never kept a past ex on social media before). Fortunately he never posts so I didn't have to worry about him bombarding my feed. But after awhile it started to hurt - he'd watch my stories within minutes of my  posting. A month ago he actually replied to one of my stories saying it  reminded him of one of our good memories and that he missed me. I told him I missed seeing him too and he never replied (rude). Finally tonight 2 months later I unfollowed and removed him as a follower. It hurt but I felt closure.

I guess my question is, after a breakup do most of you unadd/unfollow immediately afterwards  Only if it's a bad breakup? Do you just mute them instead?
