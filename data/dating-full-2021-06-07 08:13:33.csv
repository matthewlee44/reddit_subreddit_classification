I have known this girl (22F) for about a month now and we have been getting along well and I have started to have feelings for her. I'm not entirely sure but I think she also had some sort of interest in me as well. Recently we have been seeing each other frequently and she snapped me saying 'if we hang out too much, you will get sick of me, save novelty x'. Here comes my stupid ass replying like a complete idiot, 'fuck novelty'. She seened me, which makes sense. After she left, I sent her a snap saying 'Stay well rested, and don't get too stressed up about the exam, I'm sure you will do fine. And I want to ask you out for a dinner after this is all done'. She responded without mentioning anything about the date. The next day, we were just texting each other and we happened to be studying at the same library, she came over to say hi and we had a bit of yarn. Then here comes my dumbass once again telling her what I said yesterday was really dumb. Then proceeded on saying 'yeah you are right, we are seeing each other quite a lot, I suggest let's not see each other until the exams are over'. She had a blank face for a second and said 'ok'. At that moment I knew I fucked up, and when I told my friends about what happened, they all told me how stupid and dense I am. The bad thing is, I really didn't know what I did wrong by saying then until my friends told me how she would feel if she heard that. End result: she ended up seening my snap the next day and removed me on snapmap.

Reddit, I know I am really socially stupid, but I really have feelings for this girl and I want to make this work if it is possible. I am not sure what to do at this point, I think I have messed up already and she lost interest. I would really appreciate anyone who replies to this post.

I am 30 and I met a girl on a dating app 4 years younger. We chatted there for a while then we started chatting on WhatsApp. One day we talked to each other over the call and there was an instant connection. we both were taking words from each other's mouth as they say.

She is a beautiful girl and belongs to a traditional family. She is fit , friendly &amp; feminine. I am fairly good looking and in good shape most of the time. I really liked her but there was one problem she had that she was not very chatting(i.e. texting) friendly. Also, one time she ghosted me when she said she would come to see me at my house. Later she called and apologized for that, giving reasons why she could not come which made sense.

She came to meet me one day before lockdown and we had an amazing time together. We were intimate and loving and caring. After that we kept talking for a week.

*Note: I gave her ample space to think about me. I know how to build attraction just saying this to put a context and not to boost myself.*

Now what happened is I pinged her on WhatsApp one day and after some time she responded. The problem was she would reply and then vanish. So, we could not have a conversation and that Is why I asked her to let me know when she is free. So, she did not see this message but of course she had received it. 

Two days later I messaged her again saying ‘Hey’. I waited for her to reply but she did not. I waited a few days to realize she did not even see my texts.

Same time I was going through a shit storm in my life and I realized I can't stay there so I decided to go back to my hometown. Now remember it has been 6 days since I texted her no reply and she didn't even read my messages.

Her indifference made me realize that she is a beautiful girl and maybe has tons of options. I kicked myself for being such a fool again to get attached to her.

I unfollowed her from Instagram and deleted her conversation with me to not see her pics and texts as it will distract and make me kick myself time and again. I did this to protect me from being hurt.

After 12 days she called me and I had a flight to my hometown the next day.

I told her I was leaving and she was shocked and she told me she was in hospital due to Cov-19. I told her that I did wait for her to text me back but she never did. 

She asked why I had not called her?

I said why would I tell you if I feel you don’t really care about me!

She said she was sorry for not replying and we had a good talk for over 3 hours. 

The night before my morning flight she called me and poured her emotions with quite a few words and a river of tears!

She said I broke her heart and it is a lot of emotional pain to date again and find someone who you really connect with. She kept on saying I really like you!

In the end she said ‘I love you’ again and again because she felt so emotional. I am not saying she loved me or not but it was a way her strong emotions were manifested.

I told her even though I would love to love her but why all these days when I was in the same city she was so indifferent to me?  when she knows I don’t like it and had past experiences.

So the next day I left the city we kept in touch the whole day while I travelled and by the evening we both were on normal talking terms. We shared normal pictures.

She was still in pain and without sleep and so was I. I never knew that she really cared about me this much!

By that evening she would have gone to her Instagram and realized that I unfollowed her which I forgot to tell her as I felt it was not such a big thing. Her emotions were raw and strong and subsequently she blocked me from everywhere! I mean everywhere

I tried to binge call her to show I do care about her and the reason I unfollowed her was to save my emotional side not to hurt her. I texted her on the number(not WhatsApp). I tried for straight one and half days to console her via traditional texts and calling without any results.

It has been a week since I am blocked. I don't know if she is gonna unblock. 

I know it was a short two months we were talking to each other but let me tell you we really vibe and connected on so many levels. 

I am not able to understand why she is not able to look back and realize that the reason I decided to leave was her indifference to me and the reason I unfollowed her from Instagram was to protect my emotional core not to hurt her. 

Why could not we have a healthy conversation over it rather than blocking me from all over the places?

So I've dated before for 6 years and during that time,I transitioned from a state where no one drives and public transport is everything,to a state where everyone owns a car and public transport is sketchy and limited. Because I was in a relationship already,it was fine. We were serious enough that when I moved here,she moved in right away. Neither of us had a car but we took Uber and Lyft to get around,and would order groceries through delivery apps. Things ended and now I'm ready to date(or so I thought). Now some background on me. I'm 21M and I don't make consistent income,but I paid taxes on about $70k last year,made completely from home. I grew up in a poor family and my brain has been hardwired to save save save,and to question things that don't make sense financially. I make a comfortable living,but here I am,in a state full of people with cars,at an age that I will pay top dollar on insurance. I've seen some pretty conflicting discussions online,but often the person without said car,has no good reason to not drive. If I get a car,I'd be able to go places and meet people,but in my head,I can't help but think that I'm indirectly paying a monthly fee in order to date. I spend money on things that undoubtedly make sense,and don't spend money on things that don't. Is it time for a change in mindset,or basically a form of lifestyle inflation?

This girl who lives in my shared accomodation recently broke things off with her ex, and I could tell things were going bad as they were constantly fighting (first red flag, I guess)

Anyway she started opening up to me, shared how she was feeling depressed and takes anti anxiety medication, then I started caring about her, to me she was beautiful and fun to be with but I didn't want to try anything as she's recently broke up. Anyway, after a while of spending time together she opens up that she finds me attractive, she then initiates making moves by kissing me, and all the other stuff and wanted me to spend more and more time with her, this lasted about 2 weeks (seeing daily) and I admit rather stupidly I started falling for her hard.

Then on Saturday her ex returned to pick up some things, he was waiting around the room and she told me to tell him that we are going on a walk. I felt guilty about the situation as he is a nice guy, so rather I worded it by saying did he want to go on a walk. Anyway we get home and before he was about to leave with his suitcases of stuff he left behind, he gets angry at her as he said I only asked if he wanted to go for a walk. Since then she is ignoring me and not communicating at all, leaving me confused and hurt.

But then part of me thinks she was using me to feel affection as she was going through her personal demons and just needed someone to give her attention, and also she wasn't straight with her ex anyway as I am sure she failed to mention what we'd been up to so this seems contradictory from her side, but she was saying that she wants to be my girlfriend, that she really really wants me, to then going silent with me.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,821882,public,self,I feel hurt how can I move on?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nu8qx7/i_feel_hurt_how_can_i_move_on/,all_ads,6,,,

I’m a really honest person so I was straight about saying that this whole thing made me nervous and I freak out when ppl wanna meet up. I’m very inexperienced and shy when it comes to these stuff, but when he wanted to I allowed myself to get out of my comfort zone. 

Same day we arranged it (we were supposed to meet the next day — already had a time and place, he even asked if he could wear shorts lol), he tells me that he’s going out of town for the weekend...... He’s really the type to travel a lot since he was going places the week we were speaking and when my friend watched his story he really did seem to be out of town. Thing is, he ghosted right after and that left me really upset because I thought we really clicked!

I don’t feel bad for myself because I know it says more about him than it does about me for cancelling and ghosting, but it’s been around a day and a half since he cancelled and ghosted and I feel so down. I know it’s how Bumble works, rejection is a part of life, and there’s plenty of fish in the sea but none of the other conversations really had the same energy as this one.

Throughout most of my life I stayed away from relationships to focus on education and on my career (along very strict and racist parents), a decision which I regret heavily. In my high school years, I was by no means unsociable and had quite a lot of friends. I had 3 girls in my high school friend group who tried to initiate dates with me, but I rejected all of them due to my foolish decision. In university I didn't have many friends, and thus no opportunities for dates either.

Now that I have a full time job I want to find a long term partner (potentially wife), but I don't know how to approach women in a socially acceptable way. Besides my job, I am an avid learner and do some other things on the side, making me extremely busy. I know that this is no excuse, considering that many people are extremely busy and hardworking but somehow are all married with kids. And I don't think finding partners at work is a good idea.

In general, it's hard to make new friends at my new city. Even at the gym, everyone does their business and leaves immediately after. My coworkers are predominantly male and aren't interested in socializing outside of work. I'm also introverted and don't like going out to parties and bars.

&amp;#x200B;

I (25M) have been dating M. (26M) for 3 months now. From a general consensus, we decided that we were exclusives (including dating and sex sides). 

This journey has been quite (positively) intense on so many levels. We were both going on a sincere and open path. Everything had been quite positive, with 1-2 fights about small things, but still positive overall. We were learning from each other every day...

&amp;#x200B;

Last week-end, I went out with a friend to the movies. We've been chatting about our life in general (it's been a while since the last time we saw each other). Then came the subject of dating. I was so thrilled to talk about M. to my friend. He rapidly interrupted me because M. reminded him someone : indeed he matched and have been talking to M. for about a week now. They planned to see each other for some hookup this Wednesday.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so devastated, and I don't know what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

We both exchanged our feelings a few weeks ago, and I was so excited that we were both going the same way... but now, I'm questioning everything : everything he said, everything he told me, everything he did...

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any advice to share ?

For all I know they’re nasty guys that don’t shower living with their parents on disability. Spewing this aggressive better than you bullshit to me. I doubt they have as much to show for themselves as I do in all probability. Just being honest. Most people aren’t where I am. And I should destroy my self esteem on their account?

I also just hate my home life (bipolar sister) and my job. There are a few girls at my job that I find attractive, but I just don't have the desire to approach. Plus I tend to notice that a certain type of guy gets all of the girls. So much for being myself.....

Also I am being harassed online by a group of guys. They keep setting up fake profiles and catfishing me in.

So in general I am just not sure where to go from here. I want to date but I find my cynicism and resentment just getting worse.

Since a few weeks ago I started talking to a new guy and we started going out, the second time we had an amazing make out session and on the 3rd time last week I was ready to have sex. I’m pretty sure he thought I was more experienced from our previous make out session but it wasn’t something I wanted to talked about. 

So on our 3rd date we watched a movie and then started making out. We were at that for the longest time and I was really enjoying it and from his facial expressions I guess he was too. After he told me a few times that he wanted to have sex I told him to get the condom. He brought it from the closet but didn’t put it on (really confused me) and we continued to make out (full on naked) and that went on for a really long time. I guess I could tell he was hard but I really wasn’t sure (because my lack of experience and all I guess). So I started feeling really awkward because nothing was happening and thinking it was all my fault. After that I gave him a really short handjob (my first ever so I guess it wasn’t really good) and after that I’m not really sure what happened but I guess he kind of finished himself off and told me “I came” and “I’m shocked” (or something along that lines).

After that everything felt really awkward and we got dressed and he dropped me at home. 

I feel like I should clarify that since we started making out till he came it was three and a half hours of making out and also that I’m not that sure he actually came and I feel like he just said that so it would be over. Now I feel really bad because I feel like he had a really bad time because of my fault (even though I really enjoyed myself before everything turned awkward) but I want to see him again and I don’t know what to do. Advice?

Also a question I’m embarrassed to ask in person: can a guy be hard but not hard enough to put on a condom? If I give him a blowjob/handjob in that ocassion wouldn’t he just come and it be over? Or can I do it until he is hard enough and then put on a condom?

In addition to this, women like youth and looks within a man. However, success usually comes with age. Hence, most of the women face a dilemma on how to gauge the future success potential of a man.

In my experience, it is very difficult for a woman to tell if a man will end up as a below average guy or a millionaire. As an example, few girls can honestly say that they would have dated bill gates, elon musk, jeff bezos, zuckerberg in their teens or early twenties. All these guys have reached the peak of male success. But in their teens and early twenties, they were still a bit nerdy. Their early interviews rarely shows the ideal traits which girls like.

Personally, i know a few guys who have become multi millionaires in their 30s. However, all of them faced immense issues while dating in their early 20s. Even in their youth, i could see that these guys had a spark which showed that they would succeed in the long run. But few girls took the time to know them. Obviously, now these guys have significant options but it would be difficult for most women to lock them down into a long term committed relationship.

Hence, most of the girls in their youth fall for ""fake alphas"". These guys show confidence and might be hitting the gym. But they lack the character to build successful career in the long run. Many of these fake alphas even end up in minimum wage jobs where they stay for the rest of their lives.

Do you think that women face this difficulty in the dating market? How can women better gauge the true potential of a man?

Tl:dr; women often date fake alphas who will fail in the future instead of guys who have the character to succeed in the long run.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,822402,public,self,It is difficult for women to gauge future success of a dating mate,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nufmp2/it_is_difficult_for_women_to_gauge_future_success/,all_ads,6,,,

I’ve tried, but I unconsciously keep comparing myself to her. Like how I’m not that pretty, like how I met him in a toxic environment (unlike her who met him and be with him in his dream world). Or like how they had 3 amazing years together with full of memories like travelling and exploring stuffs (they were both students studied abroad) and how I’ve just had 1 year with him (rare chance to make deep memories like travelling due to COVID). Or how negative I am, maybe she was bright and lovely and that made him loved her so much. Or sometimes I will think about how they did something or the way he treated her (from others’ stories, I don’t know her), and compare that with how he treated me then blaming him for not being “affectionate enough”.
I know that he loves me. I keep telling myself that no love is comparable, and no one will love every partner the same way, but I am haunted by the idea that he will never love me as much as he loved her. I’m always scared that if they ever have a chance to be together, I will be abandoned.

Like any other relationship we have had rough moments that we always got through. We are both currently dealing with depression, I’ve seeked therapy and was placed on medication as well. Over a week ago he said he thought we should break up but we talked about things and he said he wanted to keep trying, because he loved me and he thought that our relationship was worth it. As the days went by our relationship wasn’t the same. He told me he wasn’t okay and he wasn’t happy with our relationship, despite us wanting to try again, he was distant and it was hurting me a lot. A week later I finally spoke about the situation and he said he thinks we should take a break. He said he’s unhappy with his life and that I’ve been an amazing girlfriend and have helped him in different aspects of his life. He reassured me that there was nobody else but it’s been difficult for him to figure out what he needs and why he is unhappy, while being a good boyfriend to me, he mentioned that he did not want to be the boyfriend he had been the past week. He reassured me it wasn’t anything I did, and that there wasn’t anybody else. We agreed on a week but I’m scared I’m going to lose him. We have been in a relationship for 7 months and had been talking prior to that for 3. Today is day 2 of the break, and I feel like the break is preparing me for the actual break up, it’s not what I want and I’m willing to stay by his side while he deals with his depression, but I can’t do that if he doesn’t want me to. It’s been hard not to reach out but I have to respect his decision and give him the space he needs. I believe that he is being selfless because he does not want to hurt me, and I feel like I’ve been able to do the same even though it’s only been two days by respecting the break and not questioning him or asking him to stay when he told me what he wanted.

I never reciprocated any of this, I simply kept the conversation moving because I was a bit confused. Sometimes, I would say something nice back but never to the extent of what he was saying. This guy would remember outfits I had worn months ago and tell me that I look so good in XYZ. You get the gist.

Anyway, a few weeks go by and he stops speaking so intensely because I started ignoring the message whenever he would say something like that. Then we carry on speaking normally and having daily conversations and I slowly started to catch feelings. I would drop hints here and there but then he would shut it down or swerve the conversation, kind of how I did at the start. Initially, I put this change in behaviour down to stress from finals. He would only speak to me about finals and always ask me for help with this idea or that paper. Then after finals were over, we basically stopped speaking. I needed confirmation whether all of this was serious but I realised I might have been unknowingly rejecting him so I wanted to confess that I do like him back. The phone call went badly because I started it with ""Are you actually serious about this?"" and he sounded so nervous and told me that it wasn't and he 'speaks to everyone like this'. I kept saying I didn't understand because it lasted so long and the things he was saying are not normally said to 'just friends'. But he ended with him saying it really was made up.

So I made one last ditch effort as per Reddits advice. I needed to make sure he wasn't just backpedaling. I sent him a long paragraph (the last phone call failed badly so I needed to text) admitting my feelings and saying that I never meant to shut it down but that's how it came across. I told him to take his time to reply because it's a lot to take in. He replied instantly with ""I admire that you sent me this message but Im sorry Im not interested and sorry for leading you on"". I was so confused. We messaged a bit more and I pushed for an answer, mainly because we have been close friends for so long and I felt used because he stopped speaking to me the night finals ended. His replies were so blunt and short. I really don't believe the entire thing was made up. I've now blocked him but why is he so confusing? If I could admit my feelings, surely he could say whether ANY of it was real, which some of it clearly was. What do you guys think?

TLDR: He confessed his crush on me, sent me really intense messages for a few weeks but I was unsure at the time. It was obvious that he really meant it because entertainers don't commit that much time to one girl. When I eventually caught feels, he said the entire thing was him leading me on.

I’ve been seeing this guy for &gt;2 months now (28F/ 28M).

I grew up in a conservative environment where a lot of people don’t even have sex until marriage. He on the other hand is very open to sex, has had a lot of casual sex in the past, and also has sex very early on and consistently in his relationships. 

I have had sex with boyfriends in the past, but that’s typically after a few months, and most of our dates would not involve sex (it would be mostly going out and spending the day), so I felt that sex was just a cherry on top whenever we did it, which felt good. To me, sex is still kind of sacred, and emotional intimacy is more important than sexual compatibility for me. I also derive more physical intimacy from just cuddling and sleeping together than having sex itself, which is not the case for the guy I’m seeing.

I am attracted to him and we slept together on date 6, which has never happened before for me. He has since wanted us to move forward with the relationship (to bf/ gf) but I’m hesitant and told him I need a bit more time. But at least this makes me feel that he’s not just using me for sex.

However, he wants sex everytime we meet and it’s becoming a point of conflict. I don’t want to have sex all the time and I would prefer to just cuddle and sleep together. We just had an argument - this week, he came over on Wed and we had sex. We went out for a day ytd and had a lot of fun, and he wanted sex when we get back, but I didn’t - and he was really upset about that. 

I think the reason I’m averse to it is that I want to feel like he wants to spend time with me even if there’s nothing in it for him physically, or that he feels the same closeness I feel just from cuddling together. I enjoy sex but also not thaaaat much. But physical things is important for him to feel connected.

I don’t know how to reconcile this or if this is something that we can even compromise on? Any advice is appreciated

To start off, I wanna talk about how I view relatioships, but you can skip this if you want. 

I think relationships are inherently practical. Or at least, everything in a relationship can be interpreted as being practical. I don't believe in ""loving someone for who they are"" and all of this. We love behaviors and actions undertaken by people because of the way they interact or the way we interpret their interaction with our own lives. 

This isn't to say we just marry people cause they have a good job and a handy skill, I mean you can get along with someone splendidly and it still be a wholly practical relationship. Having someone that makes you feel good is a practical use. I don't think of utility or practicality as this cold evolutionary mathematical type thing. 

Relationships have to have give and take. You need a partner to help you grow. A partner is someone who helps you, whatever help means in a given context or situation. 

Maybe help is doing dishes, holding someone, listening to them, buying them something, etc. You may recognize these as love languages, but I actually think it is a mistake to view the actions as conveyors of love. Its the actions we like and we end up loving the actor, not, we recognize the activity as a conveyance of love from the lover and so we return the love. 

This may sound kind of cold, but I really don't think it is. A lot of people use this kind of idea to use and abuse, to seperate the subjective human experience in the way science is good at doing, but once you recognize the subjective within the objective, you begin to see, or at least I think, how we are able to gain satisfaction and acheive happiness through these mechanisms of reciprocity. 

I think we want to be able to value something for what it is rather than what is does or produces, but I don't believe these things actually exist. Why we want to value something for what it is, I don't know. And I don't know how to reconcile the feeling of utility being this cold sort of thing. Kant called humans Ends not Means, so perhaps that is why we feel this way. 

Recognizing the utility of a person makes them a means not an end, but I don't think it is possible to recognize a person as an end without just forcing it in some way. 

Anyway, onto my main point 

**Start Here If Skipped**

I started dating someone recently who I honestly like and would like to continue seeing, but I don't see us having anythig long-term, maybe a year and then one of us will move cities, and that'll be that. I am okay with this. I don't think all romantic interactions have to be means to marriage. 

But, I'm noticing a trend with the women I date in which it is almost always the case that they have dated a myriad variety of douchebags and then I come along and they fall head over heels for me because I do the bare minimum requirements. 

Like, she left something in my car and only realized it after I dropped her off and headed home, and so I drove back over to her place to return it. She seemed really surprised and very appreciative I did that, but I thought, well it's an important item, and you don't live that far at all, like why would I not? 

This has happened with other girls I have dated in the past, where I help them solve some problem of there's like dealing with an annoying bank, or siging up for some thing, or dealing with a bad neighbor or just whatever right. 

It makes women like me a lot because that's what we all like, we like people who help us solve our problems. 

Except, these things I do for them are really just bare minimum things that require very little effort on my part, and these women don't return the favor. Mostly because they don't know how. They get this idea that I'm just some saint who likes their soul or something. I like ""them for them"" or whatever. But I don't, I like their choices or behaviors, just like they like mine. 

But then, when I sit down to ask myself why I like them, it almost always comes down to 

1) They laugh at my jokes 

2) They are attracted to me 

3) They are easy to talk to, or they listen to me

All of this makes me feel loved, and I realized that I'm in the same boat they are. They have been in such shitty relationships that when I show up and am just normal, they are impressed. But that's also true for me. I feel so lonely most of the time that anyone who shows interest in me I gain interest in them. 

I was lying on the couch with this new girl and I almost found myself ""falling in love"" as she was kind of carressing me, and I realized I am not in love, I just am experiencing the feeling of being loved and I like that. Because I never get to experience that feeling. 

I come from a damaged home, and I live a crummy life. I am just as abused as the women I date, but I think maybe I am more aware of it. Or aware of what exactly is happening within the relationship. 

And so relationships become these like pet projects where I end up taking care of someone and watch them grow and become more confident and capable etc. but I don't get to grow, I just get the loving feeling. 

And so the relationship is skewed where they reap all these extra benefits and I just get to be not lonely. They get the not lonely plus everything else. 

I think we underestimate the problems of unintentionally bad behavior. 

I recently bought her an item to solve a problem she was complaining about. Is she going to do the same for me? 

She has yet to pay for my meal. I have bought her several. 

My place is clean. Her's was dirty. 

We've so far only watched shows or tv she wants to. I showed her a show I liked and she was indifferent about it, so we changed it. Not the case for her shows though. 

None of these things are terrible though, they're just these little indicators of why we won't last longer than a year, or why I am disheartened by most of my relationships. No one ever seems to want to do things for me, or is able to help me. No one is able to give back properly. 

But I can't blame them in that way you can a mean and selfish person. They just don't know any better. I got sick with the flu once (before covid lol) and the girl did nothing for me, just said ""Oh I'm so sorry your not well"" in a very nice and sincere way but brought me no meds or fluids or nothing really, just ""checked in"" on me which wasn't much. When I asked her for something she might go get it but then more than once she would say, ""Oh I have work/am busy today, but i'll try."" and then nothing. 

When she got sick like two weeks later, I made her a doc's appt. took her, filled her prescription, made a chart for oscillating between ibuprofen and acetaminophen, made sure she had plenty of fluids, drove to her place and cleaned and changed her sheets she sweated thru, etc. etc. 

I brought this up to her once we were both well again, and her response was ""she didn't know to do all of those things."" She said she was impressed that I had all this like Mom-like knowledge of how to cure a flu. 

Which just really bums me out. 

Because look at what she got and look at what I got. But I can't be mad at her or upset, because her actions were out of ignorance not selfishness, though it is a certain kind of selfishness in that she wasn't proactive enough to google ""how to fix a flu"", but it's not like terrible-terrible. 

So I broke up with her, because the flu thing and a lot of other stuff made me realize, I want someone who knows how to care for someone with the flu. Don't we all? 

I can already hear a lot of you saying ""well maybe your love language is just acts of service"" but that's not my point. I don't feel unloved. I feel loved by these women. I feel used is the problem. I feel like they get all this from me and I just get the not-lonely feeling as I said, but I also keep saying ""women"" which means, ***I am able to get the feeling of being loved from more than one person***  so then I must ask myself, why am I dating THIS girl as opposed to another one? 

There actually isn't anything special about her other than she is the one who is currenlty laughing at my jokes or caressing my hair. So that when we have a fight, or she gets mad at me for xyz, or whatever, I get this feeling of ""why am I putting up with this? Why am I fighting for this?"" and thus a pattern emerges where i am forever single. 

I think we always notice the really crummy people, the ones who text during your date, disrespect your time, are inherently selfish. The number of stories of men refusing condoms, being mean to women about or during sex makes me feel so terrible because I just think ""how could you do that to someone?"", but I don't think we pay much attention to the one's who don't mean to do it, who fail out of a lack of ability not lack of proper intention. 

It's like putting down a dog who bites someone. It's not their fault, theyre an animal, animals bite sometimes, but you can't just stand by and let that behavior go because of the lack of culpability. 

So I can already see where this new relationship is going to land me. I enjoy being not-lonely, and this is my first relationship since Covid, I have been VERY single this past year, so I want to be with someone.

Literally everyone around me has advised against her but I just still really like her. I’ve been talking to her on and off for about 2 years now, met with her before the pandemic and went on an actual date with her just recently. She’s just gotten out of a toxic relationship with her ex blocking me on literally every form of communication. She’s definitely hurt me by lying about being single and whatnot but I’ve just experienced this a lot to the point that I don’t really care. The only thing that bothered me was how different she was from the last time we met. Once again she just has so many red flags and I’ve been warned against, but at the same time I just think it was how bad her previous relationship was. On our date she was just honest about everything and I just felt sad for everything that happened to her. She got in car crash, broke her neck, lost her job and was diagnosed with PTSD and BPD. She’s got a substance abuse problem (alcohol, weed, nicotine) but her ex would do harder drugs. Just observing her behavior was just so daunting, she was just afraid to ask to go to the bathroom or even eat food. Overall she’s just a dramatically different person from before and I feel like she needs help but there’s really nothing I can do. She seemed completely normal through text and snap yet this whole experience has made me less obsessive over things like people putting in effort or responding fast enough because you just never know what people are going through.

I never reciprocated any of this, I simply kept the conversation moving because I was a bit confused. Sometimes, I would but never to the extent of what he was saying. This guy would remember outfits I had worn months ago and tell me that I look so good in XYZ.

Anyway, a few weeks go by and he stops speaking so intensely because I started ignoring the message whenever he would say something like that. Then we carry on speaking normally and having daily conversations and I slowly started to catch feelings. I would drop hints here and there but then he would shut it down or swerve the conversation, kind of how I did at the start. Initially, I put this change in behaviour down to stress from finals. He would only speak to me about finals and always ask me for help with this idea or that paper. Then after finals were over, we basically stopped speaking. I needed confirmation whether all of this was serious but I realised I might have been unknowingly rejecting him so I wanted to confess that I do like him back. The phone call went badly because I started it with ""Are you actually serious about this?"" and he sounded so nervous and told me that it wasn't and he 'speaks to everyone like this'. I kept saying I didn't understand because it lasted so long and the things he was saying are not normally said to 'just friends'.

So I made one last ditch effort as per Reddits advice. I needed to make sure he wasn't just backpedaling. I sent him a long paragraph (the last phone call failed badly so I needed to text) admitting my feelings and saying that I never meant to shut it down but that's how it came across. I told him to take his time to reply because it's a lot to take in. He replied instantly with ""I admire that you sent me this message but Im sorry Im not interested and sorry for leading you on"". I was so confused. We messaged a bit more and I pushed for an answer, mainly because we have been close friends for so long and I felt used because he stopped speaking to me the night finals ended. His replies were so blunt and short. I really don't believe the entire thing was made up. I've now blocked him but why is he so confusing? If I could admit my feelings, surely he could say whether ANY of it was real, which some of it clearly was. What do you guys think?

TLDR: He confessed his crush on me, sent me really intense messages for a few weeks but I was unsure at the time. It was obvious that he really meant it because entertainers don't commit that much time to one girl. When I eventually caught feels, he said the entire thing was him leading me on.

I'm not sure if I just overthink the signs, but usually I'm very bad at signs or cues, so that fact I'm picking up on anything at all is surprising, like this is a main reason I've never been close to a relationship. Like it started off with small stuff, she randomly asked me if I was a romantic type in relationships, or just random questions about my day or what I'm doing etc. Then when we talk, which msot of the time when we talk is when I'm helping her with the baler in back, a lot of the times its cause she asks for me, but when I'm helping her, she is always close to me, she'll ask me to open this gate that drops, which she can do herself, but she'll call me if I'm nearby, and only me, and I'll lift it up and she's just really close to me when I am. Then recently she's been getting very touchy, like when I get her to laugh, which is very common, she'll fall into my arm or just grab my arm. Also, she didn't do that at first cause she knows I don't like physical touch that much,, but she eased into and does it a lot and I don't mind it. She has also asked me to help me fix her bracelet multiple times and help her with stuff like that.

Other than that, we just talk or do faces to eachother from a distance if we aren't close to eachother, but we only see eachother 3 days a week cause thats when we work together.

For the most part it’s been good and I was planning on asking her to be my girlfriend (she’s been hinting at the fact she wants me to ask)
Things have been going better and better and we’re getting on really well recently.
She went away last weekend to an island very far away from me and came back saying she wanted to go back there for a few months, she said she’d leave about a month from now. 
This couldn’t have come further out of the blue and it has really knocked me back. 
I’m not sure how I’m supposed to react, on the one hand I want her to be happy and she really believes that going there would achieve that. On the other I was really enjoying our relationship and her moving would probably end that. It feels like a lose lose to me. Either she stays and she’s unhappy or she goes and I’m unhappy.

The worst part is we’re going on holiday in a few weeks but now knowing she’ll be leaving as soon as we get back means it’ll be a weird few weeks and I don’t know if I want to go away anymore.

Should I spent the next month fighting for her to stay or cut all ties and let her go?
