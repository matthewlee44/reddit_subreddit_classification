2,pt1swh,1632293099,My (25F) boyfriend(34M) refuses to stop talking to his ex-girlfriend.,"Hi everyone,

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about two years (with about a 4-5 month break in the middle). I love him very much and I am so happy that we reconciled after a breakup that left me broken. Being apart from him helped me realize that I loved him and want to be with him.

When we were together the first time, he was really respectful about cutting off his ex gf when I asked. He respected my wishes and he unfollowed her from social media etc. When we broke up I moved out of his house and back in with my family for a bit. He works a sales job and doesn’t make any money if he doesn’t do well and gets his sales in. After reconnecting with him I found out that he had reached out to his ex gf during our break up and asked her to let him borrow money to pay for rent and groceries. He said he was really distraught when I left and he wasn’t able to focus on work. 

She let him borrow money and he says that he will never stop talking to her because she was his friend during that hard time. I understand that she helped him out and I do feel terrible about the whole situation. However, I think his communication with her is a little too much. He reaches out to her a lot, regarding our relationship (getting things back to a good place has been hard) and his job and sales goals etc. They seem… really close. And it does bother me a lot. It makes me uncomfortable. 

I try communicating this and he gets upset. He mentions her a I think lot I think  to make their friendship seem like a normal thing. But it really hurts me and I’m having a hard time understanding his need to be so close to her. Am I wrong?

4,pt1zi4,1632293928,four fucking years.,"little background:
my (23M) boyfriend of (off and on) 4 years and i (21F) recently got back together in July after 6 months of being broken up when he reached out to me and wanted to give it another try. 

we originally broke up because he just simply didn’t respect me and we fought every single day. (why did i think it was a good idea to get back together???) 

well. yesterday night, he was sleeping and i had a very strange gut feeling telling me to look through his phone. and i am not the type of girlfriend who ever does that kind of thing, so having this feeling was very strange to me. 

well. i grabbed his phone and started looking, and sure as shit. his search history was filled with “live cam sex” “live cam porn” etc. so as if it wasn’t bad enough that he was going on live cams with other females and beating his meat to randos on the internet. he took it so far as to MESSAGE THEM ON SOCIAL MEDIA AFTERWARDS. 

and the REAL kicker, is that at 12:37 am he messages this girl “heyy :) you’re very pretty” and at 12:42 am he messaged me the whole “goodnight I love you and miss you and I can’t wait to see you tomorrow”

i am filled with rage and disgust. four fucking years i wasted. four fucking years.  i know it’s my fault and i never should have continued to take him back but i cannot help but to be filled with such anger and hatred. 

once i saw this, i immediately woke him up and made him bring me home. did not tell him what i saw. then once i was back home he saw that i had sent myself a screenshot of all the messages he was sending to the girls off his phone and messages me with the whole “I love you so much I regret ever doing this! This was the only message I’ve ever sent I promise! You can go through my phone everytime we’re together please don’t leave me I can’t live without you!!” 

such a disgusting fucking joke. words cant even explain what i feel inside. 

anyways. thanks for reading. i just needed to vent about this and get my feelings out. i feel embarrassed to even tell my friends what happened because im such an idiot for ever taking him back in the first place and don’t even want to tell what happened.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pt1zi4/four_fucking_years/

I subsequently learned that she is not only flaky with me, but also with her friends, so I cannot take it personally.

A guy who truly likes you will have no problems waiting","I've seen this a lot on this sub lately. Women who say they will wait before having sex with a date because they've been used for sex in the past and then 838484 of commenters guilt tripping them saying its not going to work etc.

Here's the deal. A lot of men on OLD are just out to get laid. It has never been easier than today to get laid as an average man. Before OLD, men had to have social skills and court a lady to bring her home. In todays dating world, a man doesn't even have to have good social skills to get laid. Because of that most men aren't looking for long time relationship or to 'settle down'. Why settle down when you can get cheap sex around the block?

Since most men put in the least amount of effort to court a woman, they won't be around for more than a couple of dates without sex before they move on. If they can't get sex from a certain woman, they'll just move on to the next woman. Its a numbers game. A woman deciding to wait more than a couple of dates before having sex will weed these men out since they won't be staying around waiting go get with a woman they don't really like.

So to any woman getting guilt tripped for waiting with being intimate, don't. You have nothing to lose by waiting. In fact there's just benefits to it.

We were drunk once and we were telling eachother (me + a group of girls from my class - we have barely any guys) who is someone's type. And I told everyone that she is my type but that I respect that she has a boyfriend and ever since then she is kinda avoiding being alone with me? I have no idea what I did wrong, one of my friends who is also hanging out with the same group of girls told me that everyone keeps saying that I'm hitting on her or something like that and that I should stop. The problem is that I'm not hitting on her!! I'm just being nice and I find her work amazing. I really just want to be her friend.  I have no idea why I come off as I'm hitting on her :/ And well now she avoids being alone with me, always brings someone with her, I can be alone with any other girl in the group except with her.

What does this mean? What can I do? Is there any way to fix this? I swear I was never hitting on her. Should I just start ignoring her or something? It's weird because she still sends me memes from time to time but she never wants to talk. What did I do wrong? She talks normally to me when we are in a group.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pt3ztx/a_girl_avoids_being_alone_with_me/

32,pt45nx,1632304498,Did my girlfriend basically admit to cheating?,"
I don’t have complete evidence of her “cheating” but the situation is pretty suspicious. She constantly whines to me about “some guy” that (in her words) “keeps asking for nudes”. My response was always “idk, block him?”

Then she’d come up with an excuse like “it’s funny”

I’m finally to my boiling point especially after a friend of mine suggested that she’s probably cheating. Now I’m wondering “Hmm, it’s a bit weird she continues to chat with a guy who clearly wants something from her?”

btw, she’s known this guy for like 2-3 years or so.(She knows him in real life) According to her he’s been asking for nudes since we started dating(she always mentions him)

Today, I texted her “I feel like you may have sent nudes to that guy, not saying it’s true but that’s how I feel.” She says “You really think I send pics to other guys? You probably send nudes to other girls, am I complaining?

I completely denied it and she continued to insist that I did. The blame got switched on me really quick. Plus, what did her statement mean anyway? Sounded more like she admitted to doing it then tried to place blame on me.

I literally don’t understand anything she said especially the “am I complaining” part, like what? Lol.

I have constantly brought this up but she never does anything about it(I guess I have to now) Like that one time where she “claimed” she didn’t talk to the dude, then how else does he ask for nudes? Lol. She talks to him like every 2-3 weeks btw.

I then replied “To be honest I know that you will talk to him eventually” She said “Keep acting like this and I will.” This whole situation makes me feel like she cares about him more than me.

She then implied I was trying to call her a degrading name(can’t say it here, but it’s basically someone who sleeps around while in a relationship) after that she got mad about it.

She would lose her shit if she caught me sending nudes because she didn’t even want me hugging a girl other than her. Crazy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pt45nx/did_my_girlfriend_basically_admit_to_cheating/

My problem is that everyone I see on these apps like Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, seems to be interested in either just a hookup, or some kind of not-really-serious-but-still-semi-exclusive thing. Now, I'm a country boy. I like motorcycles, guitars, and cheap beer. I'm also at that age where hookups and that kind of thing really don't tickle my fancy, I've been there and done it before.

34,pt4fj4,1632305730,I have no desire to talk to girls,"I'm a 20 year old student at university. I have always been introverted but my problems with girls are more extreme than most. At school I couldn't talk to or approach girls as I would feel we would have nothing to talk about and they wouldn't want to talk to me. I would also fear them in a way. Then at sixth form, when you are studying maths, computing and economics at A-Level, let's just say there isn't much interaction with girls. Hence, I am now in university and I still have never been on a date, never had a female friend and to be honest never really spoken to a girl outside of a work/studying setting. My friends tell me I should be able to attract girls due to my physique (Im addicted to the gym) and height (im 6 ft 1) but I know that girls like confidence which is something I lack and I also feel that a girl would find me intimidating looking at me for the first time without knowing who I am as a person. Anyway due to me essentially being ""inferior"" when It come to getting girls i have given up without even trying. I have no desire to approach girls and just want to concentrate on my football, gym and studies. But I am worried that if I keep this attitude up I will never get married or have any relationship with a girl. I should also point out that being in the football team and going to the gym means I am often around people who get a lot of girls and to be honest, without trying to sound jealous, it has always upset me and made me kind of angry hearing their stories with girls as I hate feeling inferior (sorry if it sounds like I'm  terrible person) in any aspect of life. Also I am sexully attracted to women and my problem doesn't stem from me being gay or asexual.

35,pt4n1f,1632306574,Was it a date?,"So let me tell you my story, I’m M 28. About a month ago I met a girl F 27 thanks to a friend of mine that was in town that week. 

On that day we went to a amusement park and we spend the whole day in a group of friends. I really liked her personality and it has being a while since I actually feel like I’m connecting with someone. So after like a week I invited her but we couldn’t manage to set our schedules so we didn’t see each other for a while. 

So moving forward last weekend I invited her for some drinks, I just wanted to meet her because I feel like she’s a really cool person to be with. I didn’t have any intentions to do anything else but when I was there with her it hit me it looks like a date. We where having drinks in a cocktail bar, there were candles, I paid for the drinks and I even walk her home. But there was no kiss, I didn’t want to  do it because I wasn’t sure of how I felt. 

Afterward I even said that I enjoyed our time together and we manage to set another meeting for today.

It feels weird because I feel like I enjoyed being with her while I’m being calm, but I don’t know how she felt.

Yesterday I told him I was starting to develop feelings for him and asked if he felt the same. His answer was pretty vague, no direct yes or no, mentioned “you’re very interesting to talk to but I’m not very talkative and bad at communicating online” he also mentioned he “wasn’t prepared for something too serious” and “if you’re not ok with this I won’t waste your time” 

I’m not rushing to be exclusive because I think it’s too early but I just want to know if there’s a possibility for it in the future. 

So I asked if he still wanted to continue talking to which he said yes. I don’t know if I should stick around and see how things go or end things now?

So a girl I recently slept with has made allegations against me that are pretty drastic such as I’m rapey and I force girls to do things with me and other allegations and the thing is, in a short time span she has went back to previous girls I slept with and convinced them that I’m that type of guy. Now I’m a guy who directly deals with women for sex nothing else no relationships or anything else and I let all the girls I deal with know beforehand. So the girl who started the allegations after I slept her started spamming my phone with random lovey texts and as I always do to all the girls I do not respond to her and I never  ever respond unless it’s needed. So after 20 or so texts I block her and after that everything went  all wrong the allegations came out almost right after and since then her and my exes have been outside my house calling me names and harassing me on top of the allegations that have already been made so I lawyerd up and since then the main girl who started this has met with me and said that if I start a relationship with her and stop my ways she will drop her charges but if I don’t she will do everything possible to ruin my dating life.

 There's a flatmate(F18) who as been sort of flirty I guess. Firstly when I arrived to uni she was the first person I saw in my flat and obviously the first convo was awkward but after that we became more comfortable around each other so a few days passed we related more(typical flat-mate stuff), until one day she said I looked good in pyjamas. When I heard this I legit froze and said thank you after but I didn't take much notice of it and brushed it off as a weird compliment.  

Then today she called me handsome out of the blue. Now I was bamboozled (Ok I know this gets said a lot but it is the first time a girl as ever said this to me so this is probably gonna stick with me for like the rest of my life😂 ) and she was also very touchy with me in a playfull way(now for some more info there's also another dude in our flat and he's friends with her girl I'm talking about and they are very close to each other is watch Netflix together no not in that way ect and she does get playful with him at times)

Then after all this she asked to see my room and we spent like 5 mins both in the room just talking about it(the reason why it was awkward was due to me being socially inept) Could all of this be signs that she likes me?

I work from home for a year in a new job and never met my colleagues so it feels pretty lonely. So I don’t see anyone or do anything in weekday evenings as my job is so hard work. It’s so lonely working from home.

I have a new boyfriend who lives 2 hours away so all my weekends are spent going to see him. I try and schedule meet ups with my friends who all live in other cities around the country but they have other things going on.

So basically I have no friends where I live and I’m scared this makes me unusual? My boyfriend is moving here soon and he’s going to be the only person I ever see.

He doesn't try to do or say anything sexual (strangely, I'm the one who initiates), although if I initiate it, he's still pretty down. Overall, very respectful (this is a guy who's said the dirtiest things to me when we were still seeing each other casually).

I spend most weekends at his place as we typically aren’t able to meet up during the week due to commitments. (he has a 8 year old son (that stays with other family during the weekends). I still live with my parents, and I have uni and family commitments). He’s been an absolute gentleman from since I met him, he’s made me realise what it’s like to be with a more mature man and has made me feel happy and special which helped a lot during these pandemic and otherwise uncertain times too. I assume it probably comes with time passing in a relationship, but we don’t text every day now, now sometimes two days even pass by without any communication even though we used to text a lot and he used to try calling me quite a lot too. I usually wait about two days but I can’t wait more before I get anxious, and I text him something or, he ends up texting me something. After two days it’s like sweet, he usually sends me hearts and being all sweet so it doesn’t suggest he’s disinterested or something. Then I get reassured. We spent last night and most of today at his place, cause it’s uncertain whether we can meet up this weekend for some personal reasons. I had work yesterday then went over to his, it was a really great evening together with some alone time we craved. Yesterday he said he said he can’t wait to see me. Today was good too, we watched movies all day, and cuddled on the couch. He’s always really affectionate but as I was trying to put my head on his shoulder and hold his hand like usual he kept saying at some point “he feels too hot for that right now.” After that I think he felt bad or saw the disappointment on my face and put his hand in my lap, saying okay you can have my arm though. I kinda chuckled awkwardly but I felt sad and terrible. It felt weird to just sit there next to each other not holding hands at least but I felt stupid for wanting to and then the feeling of being turned down by him just felt too awful. Before the movie he asked me how long I’d like to stay before I need to go back home cause we realised earlier I can’t stay over two nights even though we could have, as my dad’s having surgery tomorrow and I have to help my mum at home for a little while while he’s at hospital. I told him til about 7pm. He said ok, shall we watch another movie? I had a feeling he’s rushing me home? During and towards the end of the second movie he kept picking up his phone to look at some car stuff as he wants to buy a car in a few days and seemed preoccupied. He reached out for my hand a couple of times and smiled at me but I still felt overlooked for some reason. As soon as the movie was over he was like, I’ll get you an Uber to the station (as usually he drops me back there but he doesn’t have a car right now). He literally went to order one as soon as we stood up from the couch after the movie. Then he saw that I wasn’t even dressed yet so he’s like I’ll let you get dressed and stuff haha. I went to the bathroom and picked up my belongings from his room but I was already struggling to fight back tears and didn’t want him to notice them. Then when the Uber came in like 1-2 minutes we stood at the door and I told him I loved him and we touched lips briefly before he gently directed me out the door for Uber was there. He said “I’ll talk to you soon but nowadays after we see each other I often don’t hear from him for like 1-2 days where earlier it was typical of him to message me or even call me often hours after.

We end up pretty much all talking about the same concepts: food, entertainment, health/fitness, travel, culture, etc. When it all boils down to it, isn’t every convo &amp; thing we enjoy pretty much the exact same just slightly tweaked?

Everyone likes to eat. Everyone likes some form of entertainment. People enjoy traveling. People like to rest. People like being healthy. We go through such vigorous processes sometimes to find someone, just to talk about the same things as everyone in the world is pretty much talking about. Could it be said that then the main differentiating factor really just is looks?

An extremely hot person loves eating, movies, etc. and the same with an unattractive person. Theres only small variable differences. People say looks don’t matter but im feeling like that is the highest factor that counts.

Barring some massive change where she puts in some effort, I don’t think I want to come back together after this “break.”

Since she was supposed to be the one reaching out, would it be inappropriate for me to reach out to her with the realization I’m done, or should I still give it that time? Or maybe just not say anything at all.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pt7oa1/reaching_out_during_a_break/
56,pt7onx,1632317770,Tips,"22 years old guy and looking for something new. I had my first girl friend in college (3 year relationship) and we broke up about seven months ago. Hardly talked at all after the break up, but started talking again earlier this summer. In talking we tried to rekindle the relationship, but the past few weeks it became clear the relationship was going no where. Yesterday I made the decision that we should stop talking all together.

Feel like I wasted these past few months, although I was technically ""single"" I definitely did not feel the need to meet other girls because I was talking to my ex girl friend. There are reasons for hope, I am moving out of my parents home to a new city and will have ample opportunity to meet women. 

In talking to friends, I feel like the most common way to meet girls at my age is meeting them out or the dating apps. I have doubts that these methods will work for me. Although I have some attractive qualities, I have a receding hair line. I understand that this is a massive turn off, especially considering how young I am. I realize this may not be the biggest deal, but really hurts my confidence

I personally think the best angle I can take is meeting girls through mutual friends, probably out at a bar at a party. Think this is best because I do not have to go up to a random individual, I am talking to someone that I have something in common with. I have never been the smoothest in talking to girls. I feel like I can be funny/nice, but really have no clue if the girls is interested in me or not. Due to this I have history of never making a move. I think I'm just insanely scared of being rejected.

Anyway, I was looking for advice- maybe there are better places to meet women at this age. Along with this, maybe there are things I can improve on as a person- get over my insecurities and be more confident in myself. Or maybe there are even talking points I should try to focus on when I meet new people out.

Any advice would help, thank you.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pt7onx/tips/
57,pt7st0,1632318126,FWB?,"Okay, here’s your typical Reddit dating post explaining my situation to get it sorted out in my mind and desperately asking for (compassionate) advice. 

I had this guy over for nextflix and chill a couple weeks ago. It went really well. A few days later, he says he’s not looking for a relationship. I try to talk him into one. He doesn’t go for it. A few more days pass and he’s ignored my texts and snaps and I delete and block him on everything (snap, number, Instagram).

I regretted the blocking and missed him so added him back on snap. He added me back and snapped me a little bit. Then he went back to ignoring me. Why would he add me back if he didn’t want to talk?

We also agreed to be FWB but he hasn’t seen me since the first time (even though he said we can hangout).

I have hope because I asked a guy from work if he wanted to be more than friends and he turned me down, then a few months later he starting hitting on me!

58,pt7z6u,1632318698,Therapist says it’s unhealthy to want to date? Confused.,"Talking to my therapist yesterday I am incredibly confused as to why she shamed me for saying I wanted a relationship someday. She then quizzed me on why I would even want that and I said so I could have someone to go out to dinner with or plan vacations with it just even hold their hand sitting on the couch. 

She went on to tell me that all those things can be done alone and it’s unhealthy to want a significant other and I should just want to be alone. 

I am so confused. I had a 20 year marriage break up almost four years ago and I have dated a couple of people since then (just a couple of dates) but not had a “relationship” where I would call someone a boyfriend or anything. I have been extremely alone other than having my children half the week and briefly speaking to coworkers during the day (remote working). 

I don’t want random hookups and want a real connection but from how she shamed me it’s made me feel like there’s something wrong with me for wanting to have a life partner to grow old with and enjoy life with. Is she implying that all relationships and marriages shouldn’t exist and we should all be off on our own? I just don’t get it at all. 

And before you say you should be happy alone before wanting someone else, I have been alone for a long time now, and I have been dealing with it just fine, but I’m in my 40s and I want a companion. I don’t NEED anyone since I pay my own bills and have a good job and all that, but I want a companion regardless.

I had reason to believe she liked me a lil cause things got mildly flirtatious. And just body language and the way we’d laugh really hard at each other’s jokes etc. Anyways came across her on Tinder and swiped right. Normally I don’t swipe right on girls if I have their number cause I’d rather just shoot my shot like that but because she was a coworker I was tryna tread carefully for obvious reasons. Btw we stopped working together after a while cause she got sent to the office next door for the same company so around the time I swiped right I wasn’t seeing her much and had no reason to contact her otherwise.

Relevant sidenote: Her friend was a supervisor at this job and me and the friend had a couple arguments at work. Never disrespected each other. It was mostly just miscommunication and weird stuff and we apologized to each other both times. When I saw the girl I liked after some of this stuff had happened she was less talkative. Acting way different and less excited to see me. But that could have been for other reasons. At the time I thought maybe she was stressed or she wasn’t single anymore but I didn’t know for sure. 

Anyways me and the girl I liked never matched but I went to the page where you can see likes you’ve already sent. And her bio was changed to something like “just looking for someone who gets along with my friends and we vibe well” or something weird like that. Super unusual thing to include in a Tinder bio, like that’s my first time ever seeing someone mention their friends in that context but also she had no reason to believe I’d ever see her page again so idk.

63,pt8mo6,1632320705,Thoughts about guys over 40,"I am 33F and I’ve been recently using OLD and got matches with guys in 40s (40-42) and found they are different from guys in early 30s and late 20s which used to be my date range. I can’t definitely generalize but here are the points:

- They don’t seem to be really interested in sex? Most guys I dated before comes back or keeps in touch for more sex but the guys I met they didn’t seem as much interested. They do get excited at the moment but recurring sex doesn’t seem to hold their attention.

- Because they don’t get excited about sex it is hard to tell if they are interested. Some of them try to connect more by talking and others by trying to do activities together.

There are definitely pros and cons. I am more sensitive to sex appeal so I like it when guys are turned on or become more excited about physical aspect..so with these guys it’s been hard to gauge whether they are really interested in seeing me further. Also one of them ghosted me after sex which was a shock to me because most guys I met in late 20s always wanted more. Since I usually don’t want serious but casual/semi-casual (fwb), this always worked out but looks like guys in 40s are not looking for that..then I was wondering what they really want. To be honest most of them seemed to be confirmed bachelors..

70,pt9qfi,1632323934,Things are going really well with a tinder match and it’s so nice to know I’m still able to become infatuated with someone,"
So basically even though I’ve been out of school for a few years, i haven’t had any romantic success. I’m still young obviously, but have had unrequited crush after unrequited crush, fell really hard for my best friend for a long time, had other little flirtations after that that went nowhere, not really much attention apart from that, etc. It’s been getting to the stage recently where, while I’ve worked on myself to be more confident, put romance to one side and focused on myself, and really tried to just sort my life out in other areas, I noticed I hadn’t had a thing for anyone like I used to. Even though it tended to go nowhere, I did enjoy that kind of drunk infatuation feeling you get. I hadn’t felt that in a couple of years by now, and I felt like maybe all the rejection and failed attempts had made me too guarded to fall for anyone. The idea of even dating just didn’t appeal to me; I didn’t go near dating apps for months because it felt like a useless chore, I didn’t have any interest in anyone and honestly kind of made peace with the idea I might never find anyone who I’m attracted to who feels the same, and was honestly okay with it. It kind of was weird to me that I had closed that side of me off, but it was what it was. 

Anyway, a few days ago I matched with a girl on tinder. I remembered scrolling past her before we matched, because I genuinely done a double take because she’s exactly my type. And then we matched. And then she messaged first. And we’ve been talking all day every day since, I’ve barely put my phone down. I’ve got her socials, we’ve been joking about dates, we have loads in common, we’re at similar points in our life, she’s ridiculously smart and funny, etc. It’s been a long time since I’ve had that feeling of sitting on my phone, smiling to myself while texting someone, and I can’t remember a time someone I’ve been this attracted to has shown such genuine interest in me.

And it’s really early days. We barely know each other. Maybe it will fizzle out, maybe we won’t even make it to that first date, or a million other things could go wrong. But it’s nice to know I still have it in me to be infatuated with someone like that, and to know that it is entirely possible for women I’m very much attracted to to be attracted to me too.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pt9qfi/things_are_going_really_well_with_a_tinder_match/

Sorry, this may be a post which is not usually on the topic of college subjects, but I’m a junior in College, and ik I have a year left, but I was just wondering if you guys thinks it’s weird if I graduate and not have any dating or relationship type experiences in the 4 years I’m at college.

75,pta30r,1632324943,Navigating a relationship that started as a Tinder hookup,"I am a 25 year old guy who has been single for a while for which most of the time I have used Tinder to meet people, go on dates, hookup, etc. For the last few years I have had a pretty unsteady life as I have been going to college and knowing that I would not be in that location for long as well as a desire to sort out some personal things that I did not want to bring into a relationship. Because of this, hookups or casual engagements have been the main form of relationship for me. 

I recently moved to a new city which I plan on staying in for a while and have really made strides in my personal life which has lead me to feeling pretty good. About a month ago I went on a date with a girl my age who I met on Tinder. I fully anticipated this to be the same Tinder experience as always: get a drink, go back to one of our places, and hook up. That's exactly how it went, but there was a connection between us that was unlike any other Tinder experience I have had. We both seemed to really enjoy each others company and we had a lot in common. Also, with me feeling better about life I am less opposed to something more than casual.

Since then we have been seeing each other fairly frequently, more than just in a hook up context. We go on really fun dates, hang out, watch movies, cook together--I even suggested that we slow things down sexually so we can get to know each other better. We have both expressed that we like each other and spending time together. Everything seems to be going very well but this is a strange situation for me considering how the relationship started. I just am starting to feel confused about what I ""should"" be doing or how the relationship ""should"" be going with how it started with sex, slowed down a little, and is now picking back up as we get more comfortable with each other.

Does anyone else have an experience like this?  I have read a lot of stories about Tinder success stories but I am unsure of how many of them came from what was supposed to be just a hookup.

81,ptap6s,1632326684,"Came back to Hinge after a bit of a break, and it's like... WTF happened to this app?","Every fourth or fifth profile says ""Just joined"" and is clearly fake with some too good-to-be-true pictures of a conventionally attractive person. The profile info on them hardly matches the prompts, so you know they're fake. I also see a lot more profiles blatantly advertising sex work with images that give you a link or a snapchat name.

There also seems to be way more profiles on there in general, which I'm guessing is because the app is finally hitting its stride with mainstream in the same way Tinder and Bumble have, and since people are probably sick of Tinder and Bumble, they're moving over there. Crowded profiles mean having to swipe through way more profiles you're not interested in plus it's more difficult for your profile to be noticed by others. Whenever I'd rejoin the app, I'd get 30-50 matches within the first month or two. I've gotten maybe 5 so far after a few weeks, most which have already died out, and I'm not receiving any new likes.

Add to that, Match's ownership of the app continues to gatekeep success for its most attractive members by hiding them all behind its ""Standouts"" section, which you need to purchase ""roses"" to leave a message and like for. The general premium service also has lessened in benefits as well, only giving you the ability for unlimited likes.

We all know most apps at the end of the day are a business that benefit only a select percentage of highly attractive Instagram model-type people, but Hinge used to be one of the apps that connected someone like myself -- decently handsome but not necessarily a model, very fit, and has their shit together with a well curated profile with very recent pictures and original personality in what's written -- with others who were very much in the same lane as me.

Anyway , i want guys/girls discuss your opinions and if you know good examples/lines  of pullaway or how to tease a girl , write them down.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ptb1tf/how_to_tease_a_girl/
88,ptb21i,1632327671,Is he into me if he wants me to move to his place?,"So I was discussing how much I hate my apartment and how expensive it is with my guy friend. There have been sexual tension between us before and we get along really well, I like him but I've been unsure if he sees me as a potential partner. He was like you should move. And I said well yeah, I just don't have anywhere to move rn. My guy friend shares an apartment with his friend. I jokingly asked if I could move to his place, expecting him to say ""yeah no you can't sorry"", but he was like yeah sure next summer after graduation when he gets his own place. 

I know I was joking, but is this his way of flirting and showing interest in me? I feel like you don't really tell women they can move to your place just like that unless you're at least a little bit interested. Or am I reading into this too much?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ptb21i/is_he_into_me_if_he_wants_me_to_move_to_his_place/

91,ptb5fx,1632327930,If personality matters so much then why don’t you cut your own face off?,Personality means nothing in a world inhabited by shallow hypergamous women! Personality is a secondary trait in dating. Women are shallow and we have the evidence to prove it! They are hypergamous and over value themselves cause of the hole in between their legs! They want looks first and then maybe personality if you’re not hot enough on looks alone. If looks are not a deal breaker then why don’t you let me take a blade and cut up your face? Your personality will be the same and that’s what counts right? That’s all you need to be successful in dating right? So why not let me use a razor and destroy any external beauty you have cause it’s all superficial and doesn’t matter right? You’ll still get plenty of dates cause you’re just a peach to be around!,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ptb5fx/if_personality_matters_so_much_then_why_dont_you/
92,ptb90h,1632328210,Are there any other apps for meeting people like on Meetup?,"I've been reading quite a bit of this sub and others recently and I've been tempted to try and work on myself, socially, so I can gain some more confidence when talking to new people.

One piece of advice I often see that goes hand in hand with dating is to just try and meet as many new people as possible, in particular through apps like Meetup. I've downloaded Meetup and so far I haven't really found any groups or events near me that appeal to me in all honesty.

For one thing my city isn't even on there so all of the events near me are in the next town over. It's only a train ride away but its still a bit of a hassle to get there. The other problem I have is that most of the events are either geared towards older people (38-55 speed dating as an example) or they're tailored towards a hobby that I have no interest in.

There's basically not a big enough variety of groups/events that I feel I can easily fit into and just not enough going on near me. It might just be my location (UK), since I have seen some stories on hear of people having successes expanding their social circle and working their way into dating through Meetup but so far I don't seem to be as lucky.

So I'm curious if there are any other similar apps or sites I could use for this. I know this isn't 100% related to dating, so feel free to remove but I was hoping to help work on my social skills through meeting new people this way as a way of working on myself for dating.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ptb90h/are_there_any_other_apps_for_meeting_people_like/
93,ptbb8i,1632328377,Any advice?,"I’ve (24f) posted about this before, figured I’d give a update. I told my fiancé (28m) that he could be 100% honest with me and he told me that the video of the girl pegging the guy was like 30 seconds long. He saw it and was curious as to how it worked. He said he realized that wasn’t his thing and not something he was interested in. I was upset that he’d lied and said he just saw a part of it. I’m dramatic, so I cried and in the moment told him “I’m done”. He immediately was frazzled thinking I was gonna leave him and he called my mom and had a longggggg talk with her (I didn’t know). My mom ended calling me and explained that it wasn’t that big of a deal and that men watch porn and as long as he’s not into men on men porn I shouldn’t be worried. Idk how to feel. Any advice ?

That being said, occasionally I will become very interested in a guy on there before he randomly stops responding, so I kind of want to reach back out to see if there is a chance for us to reconnect. So is there a way for me to message him again on there without seeming desperate even though he didn’t respond to my last message? Should I give it some time before I message him again? Or is it useless to message him again, and i should just move on?

96,ptbj5o,1632328991,The dude I’m seeing was on tinder right in front of me,"I (F30) was at this guys (31M) house the other day. We were having a great time, I cooked him lunch, etc and then I see that he gets on his phone and there is a red light coming from his screen illuminating his face and then it turns to a white light. 

I’m not an idiot. I know what tinder looks like. 

It made me upset. We are not officially together, but we have an agreement that we’re not going to be seeing other people. We’ve been consistently hanging out multiple times a week for the last month and I thought it was going really well. 

To be on tinder when I’m at his house feels incredibly disrespectful! He could tell that my mood changed and asked about it so I asked him if he was on tinder. He claimed to be looking at stories on Instagram. I do not believe this at all. I went on Instagram to see what kind of colors are associated with it and the opening screen of Instagram is black and so is the background of Instagram. He says he was looking at a story that must have been red. He seemed to stumble when giving me this explanation which just makes me feel even more certain that he was lying. 

If you want to keep a dating profile on your phone just in case things don’t work out, whatever. But if you’re actively using it and messaging people especially right in front of me, I’m not sure I can think of a more disrespectful thing that’s been done to me to my face. I really really like this guy, but now I don’t think he respects me. I’d love to give him the benefit of the doubt, but I want to trust my intuition too. 

What are your thoughts on this? 

TLDR: we agreed not to see other people, yet he’s using tinder while we’re in the same room",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ptbj5o/the_dude_im_seeing_was_on_tinder_right_in_front/

98,ptbw6q,1632330034,Was I a jerk for telling a girl who's clearly friend zoned me that I have a crush on her,"So today I (20m) hanged out with a friend that ive been meeting occasionally for the past few weeks. She's one of the first few good friends I've made since Going back to college. I wanted to tell her today that I liked her the moment we met up, but instead I ended up telling her after we hung out for most of the day.

Now there's a few signs that were obviously clear that she wasn't interested and saw me as a friend. Firstly, she's chinese and I'm american. I have had other friends who were also from China and mostly their only into other Chinese. Not always, but mostly. Other than loving american music and culture, she didn't seem to be one of the exceptions. Secondly she has male roommates who she talks about frequently, so I know her just hanging out with me wasn't anything special. Thirdly is that I met one of her roommates. And let me tell you, this guy is a Chinese STUD! Hell, that dude was enough to stir whatever gay in my body to arise. Knowing that I'm going again this, I know some random white dude she barely knows wouldn't have much of a chance.

However, I still feel I needed to tell her. Of couse I was hoping that she would say she has mutual feelings, but that wasn't all. I was feeling like a creep. Here's this girl who's been in america for only a month and still learning the ropes. and here's this guy who's being nice to her, teaching her little nuances of the US, but is hoping to get a little more out of it. That sounds like a form of predator I don't know the precise term of. So for that I decided I just gotta tell her

I basically just told her that I have a crush on her, and if I was acting weird today it was because of that. I think she was surprised, but she seemed okay with it. But she said unfortunately she doesn't feel that way, and I said I figured. I also told her I didn't want her to think I have alternative motives for hanging out, and I just wanted to be fully honest. She was very understanding from the looks of it. She said genuinely that she was sorry she didn't feel the same way. I told her there was no need. Something that did kinda confuse me was she asked if there was anything I was expecting or wanting from her. I said not at all and that was it. So after all that we said our goodbyes and left for the day.

Despite my previous reasoning, I still feel like an 1asshole for doing it. She was having problems making friends to begin with, so she enjoyed my friendship. Now this is out of the bag and maybe it's Making her questioning our time together. Of course I want to keep being friends with her. She's one of the most interesting people I've ever met. But now I feel maybe I've soiled the friendship cause I couldn't keep that passion to myself.

99,ptc3rp,1632330616,Getting ghosted after the girl told me she really likes me after first date?,"So I went on a date with this girl from tinder last month, it went well, she told me she wants to take it slow so am nothing happened other then getting to know each other. Anyways she liked me first on the app and I ended up liking her back. We eventually texted and had a bunch of conversations everyday. The thing is I told her I was going on a one month vacation to Italy so if we wanted to have a 2nd date she would have to wait. So she agreed and told me she definitely wants a second date this and that. But here’s the confusing part, we also texted when I got to Italy but she eventually ghosted me like 2 weeks ago and I haven’t texted her back, since I don’t want to seem clingy or send another text… I don’t know what to do and I told her on our first date that I’m not one to play games, I told her that if you’re not interested in me anymore you can just tell me, she agreed.
