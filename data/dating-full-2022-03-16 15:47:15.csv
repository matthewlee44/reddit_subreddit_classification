We only dated exclusively for five months but I used to experience romantic attraction fast. I will admit that I am just a very emotionally sensitive person who can be a little co-dependent at times. I'm in therapy to work on it.



I actually loved him. He was sweet, caring, we had the same interests, excellent sexual chemistry and he was only a bit dumb but it was cute.  I had to break it off because he admitted to being a pedophile who has abused a child relative in the past and thought it was sexy. What makes it worse is that he had brought up wanting kids in the future months before that. I don't even know why he told me this. He must have been stoned out of his fucking mind that day. I'm a past victim of childhood abuse of that nature so I felt used and disgusted. I would also be mortified and blame myself if I found out the man I trusted harmed our own children.



Ever since the breakup I can no longer feel any romantic feelings for anyone. I don't actively try to do it. It's unnatural for me to be cold-hearted like this and I'm worried it will never go away.

I broke up with my ex of over 1 year 1/2 because he went back to school in august and we were fighting a lot. He was a college athlete &amp; finishing up his last year at a new school I wanted to suprise and visit him so I booked a flight and told him and he got mad because he wanted to discuss which dates I could come so he would be free to see me. I was hurt by the situation &amp; also was hurt because I said I love you back in august and he never said it back after a year of being together!!! I truly thought he would’ve and so did all of my friends.. so with all of this being said I had enough and said this isnt working and we broke up.  We didn’t cut off all communication until January. He came back home for Xmas break and I wanted to meet up for closure he was hesistant based on our history and didn’t want all feelings to come back since he was only here for a week. We spoke and eventually made out but he would not sleep with me. He winded up crying to me saying how tough is sport is and how he’s been going through a lot. I asked him if there was anyone else since he’d been sort of distant and wouldn’t sleep with me, he swore there was nobody else. Fast forward to January I find out he is seeing this girl from his school and she’s posting it all on social media, when she found out I knew who she was. I was heart broken because he completely lied to me when he saw me by saying he wasn’t seeing anyone. I ended up blocking him on Instagram in January , and then Valentine’s Day comes around him and her both block my 2nd Instagram and he blocked me on Snapchat. I’ve never been more hurt and idk how to handle it. I want to reach out but I feel it won’t get me anywhere. She made a story post yesterday saying I miss my boy, and he reposted on his story saying miss you more. This honestly broke me. I feel he’s in a rebound relationship bc he moved on so quickly into a brand new relationship, and legit this girl is the complete opposite of me . He comes back home the end of April for good! Please give me advice!

(Warning this post is a bit of an espresso of depresso and there is some disturbing stuff in it involving domestic violence, bullying and cancer).

So I'm 25 and I've never been on a date and have recently started putting greater effort in putting my self out there. The reason why I didn't do it earlier is because of a host of issues that hindered my confidence and dating capabilities. (What I'm going to talk about might not seem relevant at first and I promise I do not mean to sound like I'm bragging but it might help you understand my current state of mind).

Firstly, I lived in an unstable household until recently that was filled with alcoholism and domestic violence towards someone very close to me. Because of this, in elementary, middle, and to some degree high school, I was a timid kid because at home, I felt like I was walking on egg shells to protect the person I love from abuse. Also because of the fear brought on in the environment at home, I developed an eating disorder which made me very skinny on top of being short which made me an easy target for bullying and in turn caused my grades to suffer (for reference, at 15 I weighed 90lbs \[40.8 kg\] and was 5'1 \[1.5m\]). By 11, I wanted to take an extreme measure with my life.

Fortunately, I found martial arts and because of it, I found confidence and purpose in my life. I was getting involved more in school, I started standing up for myself and my grades began sky rocketing despite elements of the bullying still being there (actually a few years ago I was nominated for  Oxford's/ the world's most prestigious scholarship). It's the closest thing I could get to Hogwarts loool. Nevertheless, when it came to women, I was still afraid to even ask them out because when I did get rejected, it sucked emotionally speaking and I would get bullied more once everyone found out and I just got tired of dealing with it. 

In my senior year of high school, I was diagnosed with cancer and in addition to me beating it, it somehow boosted my confidence. Ever since then I began working out (I'm not huge but I have a healthy body and I eat right). I also built up the courage to talk to a few girls both who I met and never met before, flirt with them and get their numbers in university. Unfortunately, none of this panned out into anything.    

So usually in the past I didn't let a rejection hurt my confidence and I tend to just smile about it, laugh it off and just be happy that I had the courage to ask a girl out. But recently, I've tried dating apps and since I downloaded it about two weeks ago, I've gotten four matches on Tinder but no responses (I would say I'm average looking but short \[5'7\]). I should also point out I've asked out less than 10 girls up to this point. 

What's making me feel even more defeated is I asked this girl from university that I REALLY like out and she said she's not looking for a relationship right not but was down for a date. The thing is with her she said was busy on the last day I planned and she asked to reschedule and I told her to let me know when she was free so we could plan something then. This was in late Feb early March and there's still no response there's more to this story so if you're interested click the link below for my post where I explain it more in depth. 

All of this just makes me feel like I'm unworthy of dating and takes me back to the days where I got bullied. 

So I was wondering do you have any advice for me? 

Thank you for reading this :)

So I actually wanted to leave earlier but my boss did not want to. Even though I had some vacation days left (he sold them out).

Him: ""Like it would just be a lot for me and I did not prepare for it. I guess, I will hear what the result will be""


Me: ""ooh ok, I will let it go then

You are lucky that I like you, (his name)""


Him: ""well, you can talk to the supervisor if you want. I will have peace with whatever""

😬 I am kind of ashamed, the way he reacted to ""you are lucky that I like you"" and he then did not read the texts after that. I am afraid, that he will talk to others since it is not mutual and that I should read between the lines.

* You are single over the age of 30.
* You are on dating apps. 
* You have lots of matches but they're not quite what you're looking for.
* You go on lots of dates but they don't turn into a relationship.
* You want someone you feel a spark with.

Okay, I know the first two were a bit dramatic. But it's a feeling. 

At the same time, I see a number of discussions that promote being comfortable on your own, learning to love yourself, focusing on self-improvement, living the life you would want in a relationship on your own, etc. These are all ideas that greatly appeal to me. I like taking myself out on dates. I really enjoy the well-rounded life I've built with career, family, friends, hobbies, etc. I like running the balance between working on myself and just admiring the moment. 

I don't *need* a partner, but I would really like one! I'm not into the whole spark thing but if I'm going to spend time with someone, I'd want it to be with someone I think is great. And I'm totally willing to put some effort into discovering and/or building that. Otherwise, what's the point? I don't want to be picky but I also don't want to settle.

We are together for 3 months and we live in different citys that are not that far. Recently i fucked up. I usually just dont say anything when i get mad or if something is annoys me but something hit me and i decided to tell her everything that has been bothering me in relationship. The biggest thing was that we usually go out together maybe 2 times a month becouse we can see each other onli on weekends. I was getting mad becouse she has ben declining to go out for almost a month because of her volleyball matches. She doesn't have them but when she doesn't have them she always says that she has bad grades and she rly doesn't she usually gets As. Also when we have some random school breaks she would rather go to her volleyball training than go out. Last nigt i said that it was bothering me and she got angry and tried to break up but changed her mind and said thet she overreacted a bit but that it was mainly my fault.

They're either open with me and visibly show kindness/interest/care, which makes me lose interest in them from the start, I'll go on a few mild dates and hook up with them until my initial lust/mystery around them fades and then we'll stop talking.

 Or, the person impresses me, or is cold/shady (looks through me more than at me, shows subtle but consistent signs that they're not completely interested), but throws me some ounce of affection once in a while, and I'm completely hooked. They take over my mind, and then they catch onto my interest and they become more removed, my interest and anxiety increases until by the time I see them next our dynamic has completely changed, they're cold and I'm needy and jealous, and things die pretty quickly.

It even happens in friendships to a lesser degree, sometimes I can obsess over a new friend not responding until I get so worked up that the next time I see them, it's almost impossible to be caring and relaxed.

A big part of the disconnect comes from the fact that we really haven’t had many deep or meaningful conversations. I think this stems from just being different than one another and not having a whole lot in common. Often times our conversations are more or less the same and revolve around gossiping about her friends and gossip/drama that happened that day. She also likes to party and over-do the drinking, where as I’m just the opposite. She told me that I’m her 8th sexual partner, and that she wouldn’t turn down an opportunity to have sex, which kind of turned me off. All in all I feel like her and I are just different even though she’s a really nice girl that has done nice things for me.

I’m new here, and am just looking for some advice about a dating situation I got myself into. To make a long story a little less so, I’ve been going on dates for about two weeks with a guy I met on tinder and continued to talk to for some weeks after. Keep in mind, this guy lives about an hour and 10 out so driving back and forth for dates can be quite exhausting, but also very much worth it because he’s great in person. The problem arises whenever there’s a lapse in time before our next date usually 2-4 days depending on how busy life gets. Anyway, during these period of time he’s becomes increasingly dry, unresponsive, or just absent. I realize some people aren’t the best when it comes to texting, but he takes it to a whole new level, regularly leaving me on delivered for a whole day just to answer with a “sorry I didn’t text” and blatantly ignoring everything I said or asked about meeting up and hanging out. This culminated in our last date (the third one) where we talked about expectations when it comes to communication and he “promised” he would try to text hourly (which again is not my expectation it’s what he proposed). Since then the texting has actually become more sparse, with maybe one message a day at best, usually apologizing for not texting. This reached its Zenith when I outright told him that if he wanted to ghost to just not, and tell me we’re not compatible and leave it at that. We’re supposed to “talk” later about “what we are” (which we covered on our last date as exclusively dating). Anyway, any advice about how to navigate this predicament?

I(27F) finally met someone I really like. When I was about to give up on apps (and therefore dating in general, considering the town I live in), I matched with and started to talk to this lovely and smart guy. I was very skeptical at first, I had kind of lost hope to meet someone online, so when he proposed to meet I was ""Yeah, ok, whatever, let's meet and see"". I was so wrong, and I am very happy about it! He's a very interesting person, and I really like him.

I am not in love, but I really appreciate him a great, great deal. We have been to four dates so far, and I sometimes think he's sending some signals. But I am super afraid to fuck up, to misunderstand him and these bloody signals, and to put him in an embarrassing situation. I'm afraid that he is too good for me, and this leads me to be sometimes very shy when I am around him. 

So this is my dilemma (I know, I know, it's everyone's dilemma): I don't want to let this chance pass (I like him a lot!

This guy has jerked me around for nine years. He’s known me since I was 16 and he was 18. He’s always made it clear that he would never be serious about me and always rubs his relationships in my face. He’s made it clear that he finds me not very attractive and says I’m mad. I self-harm a lot, and my self-esteem is low. He constantly baits and switches me. I can take it like he’s single to hook up with me and ignore me to find out he’s in a relationship.


He’s used me to cheat multiple times without me knowing. And if I try to ignore him because I don’t want to fool with him or because I know that he’s in a relationship, he’ll send me many text messages or blow up my phone. And then if I give in, he’ll act like he’s too good for me and that he’ll never be serious about me and that it’s just sex. This is gone on for nine years. I honestly don’t think I’ll ever be in a relationship; I believe that no man will ever want me.

He’s serious about other girls or dates them more seriously and takes them out on dates. He posts passive-aggressive stuff about me about how I’m not very attractive and annoying. He’ll make a passive-aggressive post on social media about how I’m a h*e and that my personality is annoying.


I’ve never asked anything of him, and I’ve only asked him to be in a relationship when I was 18, and then I realized that I needed to move on with my life. I try to move on and not see him. I moved states and moved other places, but he’ll beg and beg for me to talk to him and ask me to move closer home with him even though he’ll never be serious about me. I don’t understand why you treat me this way or why you are in never be serious about me. You stopped to be bro over nine years, and I feel like I’m such a loser.

He’s seeing someone else now more seriously. Why does he treat other girls better? What’s wrong with me? Have you ever used a girl for sex to feel guilty about it later?

I (20 Male) am too cheerful and also a good-looking extrovert person who can talk to anybody with any struggle. When I'm with people I'm smiling 90% of the time, I listen to them carefully so I'm able to keep an interesting conversation and so people feel that I'm really paying attention to them. People have told me that I'm a trustworthy person, so almost anybody feels like telling me private things related to their personal life. BUT FOR SOME REASON I STRUGGLE TO FIND A GIRLFRIEND. I mean, I have no problem having dates with women, I've done so many times, but everything stops there, I can't get to a deeper sentimental zone with them (and no, they don't ghost me). So, I have some questions for women:

\--- Is being too trustworthy getting me in the friendzone?

\--- Since I tend not to flirt with women, is that stopping them from giving me signals that I like them?

\--- If you see no problem in what I said, what should I try to do or be in order to be in a sentimental relationship with a woman?

I get super in my head about first date kisses, as in I will psych myself out if the moment just doesn’t feel right. 

For example, just had a date where we were standing in like a weird spot next to her car, and I kid you not, I thought I was weird to do the kiss when it was still light out 😂. (Was a bit of strangely timed date). But the date itself was nice, and obviously I always want to kiss a pretty girl lol but if the moment is off, I just can’t overcome that thought. 

So ladies, does it make you feel like the date didn’t go well, especially if you wanted the kiss? Does it reduce your desire for a second date? Do you think we’re less of a “man” if we don’t go for it?
