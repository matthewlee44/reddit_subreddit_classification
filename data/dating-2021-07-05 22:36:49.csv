9,oeneul,1625544579,I hate that alot of average guys cant really date a consistently like that in their 20s.,"It just really sucks honestly.  Everyone knows that women are at their peak attraction in their early to mid 20s. So in turn women get the cream of the crop men while the overwhelming majority of men under below average struggle to get scraps. This is why you constantly see very lonely and depressed at their dating lives. One of the most common questions you hear on the dating sub is why is online dating so unbelievably hard for men.


 Its very hard to find gfs or just laid as a guy that is not above average and above during his 20s. Even if you are going for unattractive or average themselves.  So unless a guy bulks up Hugh Jackman, makes alot of money, or looks like Harry Styles is just freaking tough. Or he might as sit out for his 20s and date at 30s.

Its a very tough game to win. Older women dont want you because they dont like dating younger men. And even younger women dont want you because they like older men as well. They want a guy with experience. Which alot of younger guys dont have.

Studies support that 51 percent of men in the US are single between the 20s and 30s range. Let that sink in",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oeneul/i_hate_that_alot_of_average_guys_cant_really_date/

The dates I’ve gone on with women my age don’t feel light and fun. It seems like they want to lock a life partner down and there’s just an underlying focus and pressure. It feels too archaic.

I’ve (20F) been celibate for a year before this happened.

I matched with guy (25) that I thought was out of my league. He’s tall, Brit accent, blonde, witty with a good job. So I ignored him because I know he got options.  We wouldn’t text really, I would be so tired leaving home at 6 am and coming back at 7 pm, I had no energy to text during the weekday. Well some way or another I let him take me to the arcade on Saturday. 

He was being really fuckboyish, trying to charm me and make out with me fairly quickly. I had no intentions to have sex with him, but when he said we should watch a movie I thought at the theaters but we went to his apt.

While there we talked we had lots in common and we made each other laugh so much. One thing lead to another and we started making out. I would stop him then he’d try again later. Almost 2 hrs

As we started talking about his job in pharma- I found out we were both shroom heads. He had some so we both took a small dose.

We had lots of fun, talking about family, our love for sports, ghosts, sunny refrences and lots of sex intill 4am. He couldn’t get enough, it was a lot. 

We woke up the next day, he kept gazing in my eyes and telling me I was beautiful. I told him I had to go but he wanted me to stay. I eventually took a shower and he followed me in there saying more cheeses stuff.  I’m not gonna lie I thought he really liked me and I wanted to see him again.

When I was leaving out the door he told me he wanted a good bye kiss but I was already half the way out. I just said see you later. 

He hast texted me since that encounter on Sunday morning. Now it’s Monday night. I guess I was just a pump and dump to him. 

I know he will text me during the week, but idk if I should tell him I don’t wanna meet up anymore as I felt so much Shame after the hookup.  

I really fell used, and worthless. I regret having sex with him, he doesn’t even check in with me if I got home safe. I want him to know I’m hurt, but idk if that will be in my best interest

27,oep6kh,1625552153,Your Social Network is the Most Important Thing when it comes to finding potential dating partners,"Hey everyone, 23M here and I would like to share my thoughts on finding potential dates. For the last 5 years or so I've been attempting to use dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge to find dates. After very little success (literally 2 dates in 5 years), I've given up on these apps. Dating apps just don't work anymore. I used to think it was the app's fault, but now I've realized online dating just really doesn't work. Most popular websites like Instagram, Reddit, Twitch, and various dating apps are still heavily male dominated. The result is men desperately trying to get the attention of a handful of women whose inboxes are flooded with messages from guys. Apps like Tinder are basically impossible to get dates on due to the dating market being so saturated with guys. Making yourself stand out in a sea of men is increasingly harder to do.

On top of that, I've found online dating for women poses several annoyances and risks many men tend to overlook. For women, meeting up with a guy she just met online can be dangerous, as she has limited information about the guy and if he truly has honest intentions (of course this works the other way around for guys, but rarely is a problem). Women also have to deal with a ridiculous amount of thirsty guys who do things like ask for nudes right away, act like simps, and/or send dick pics. In general, people are allowed to act wayyyyyyy worse online than they can in person, hence this behavior.

I've given up on online dating, but it made me think. . . how have other people done it? I've realized most people I know who are in relationships or at least have sexual partners didn't actually meet online. They usually met through a social network, mainly either school, work, church, some other organization, or mutual friends. It's kind of strange since these networks don't have the purpose of finding partners, but turns out they're much better at it than Tinder ever could be. These methods of meeting potential partners has several advantages I've never considered. I think the biggest one is having more information about the other person. When you meet a potential partner through one of these methods, you can usually find out more information about them through your social network. As a guy, I've realized having another person, especially a woman, vouch for you and your character can be useful when dating. This helps other women trust you and lets her know you're not dangerous. I think this is why many women use mutual friends to find them dates.

Using your social network also has other side benefits. Often times, it gives you and the other person something to talk about (i.e. work, school, mutual friends, ect.) It might also be easier to integrate them in your social gatherings if they're already in your network. Of course, the risk is if you two get serious and then break up, it could cause a rift in the social group so be careful.

Most of my family and friends met through one of these means. My parents met at college, grandparents through high school, two sets of aunts/uncles through college, one set of aunt/uncle through a company, my brother and his gf through high school, and a couple of my good friends met at our high school. I can't think of any serious couple I know well who met through Tinder or something similar.

The crazy thing is, I really figured this out through something called FetLife. I've recently gotten into the BDSM/Kink community. Most people in the BDSM community have a profile on Fetlife, which is like a kinky version of Facebook. There's a lot of guys on there that just try to use it as a dating service, and of course it doesn't work. They never get any responses to messages, and no one will meet up with them. The key is actually getting involved in the community and going to in-person events. When going to events (called ""munches""), you get your face out there, people start to recognize you and trust you, and you build friendships. This all helps your reputation, and can lead to more dates than just stalking profiles online. Your social network really helps, and you get to meet cool people!

Getting out of the kink world, I would say if you want to find more dates, build your social network. To do this, try to get involved in local events or communities in person (especially now since things are starting to open up again). Go out of your way to talk to new people and build connections. I will say don't do something for the SOLE purpose of picking up women (e.g.  if you don't like pottery, don't join a pottery class with the sole intent of dating, you will be miserable). If your only interests are all male dominated interests (gaming, sports, cars,), it's going to be a bit more difficult to follow this advice, but I'd still say socialize with people just to build community.

tl;dr: online dating doesn't work due to lack of trust, better to use social network since there's already established trust and reputation and you build community",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oep6kh/your_social_network_is_the_most_important_thing/

29,oepd97,1625553029,"Some advice, after matching with a lot of cute guys and ghosting a few","I am 23F and let's say, I tried OLD again, just cause I was bored, I don't really date and well I even avoid hookups, just cause I don't inherently feel the need 

Anyway, I decided to have fun cause they are so many cute guys on there, so I went around swiped around 10-15 people, matched with most of them and this is what was so turning on about some and so turning off about some 

This is just personal advice, I hate all kinds of PUA stuff but man some of this is good, weather or not the guy is doing on purpose 

Guy 1 : Cutest of them all, I was drooling over him and well he was really smart about keeping the conversation clean and just using one emoji now and then, which was enough to make me feel things, I complimented him and expressed my interests and we might meet up for drinks 

Guy 2 : Attractive, not as much as in the pics but 100% made it up for his humor, which was actually funny, not braggy or trying hard and not trying to be too cool, also definitely putting me on pedestal and being dramatic but also very accepting, so accepting that he was the only one I sent some sexy videos because I was sure he wouldn't judge! 

Guy 3 : Younger to me, cute, a bit shy and awkward, we are both really sub, so we just dropped the whole sexual thing but good friends anyway 

Guy 4 :  attractive at start, liked deep conversations, started to kill it once he got braggy about his body count and also asking me questions that indicated him questioning my hotness (blocked) 

Guy 5 : attractive and cute, too forward, sent me a dick video on the first conversation and some muscle flexing, he is a bit younger, so forgivable for the immaturity but would not meet him because, it ruined the spark for me 

Guy 6 : looks average but really keen on eating me out and made it very obvious in the first 10 mins of the conversation, unfriended right away 

Guy 7 : matched with an old friend, cute, hit it off mutually and wow, this guy impressed me, when I mentioned about STDs, he was like let's get me tested, and he was okay and concerned about my convenience, cute and agreeable, also someone who explicitly asked me to not put any real effort in dressing up or anything and just show up, when I told him I need some heads up to meet him

So, overall, if a girl swiped you, she is already attracted, yes everyone puts their best pics out there and you'll be 30% less attractive in real, everyone knows that, please make it up with being a genuine person who can talk about things and add in healthy flirting, she will signal back wanting more and only then get actually dirty but still stay in lane, check for her comfort, respect boundaries, go that extra mile because honestly, if you don't, someone else will 

I ended up telling some guys how they are too good to be true, because of how sweet they were, even if I am not 10/10 into them looks wise

Also, I am not fussy about height in men, tho most of them were tall, it doesn't matter, yes, I am a bit concerned about weight because I am myself pretty skinny 

So, being authentic is as good as it gets, that doesn't mean anything but not following some dumb tactics, if you're nice, be nice, if you're an assol, be better, playing hard isn't cool, but some restraint shows you're a man of culture

40,oeqbbp,1625557640,Mysteries at the party,"I  started going out to party with some friends some days ago. Because I  was never the most social person of my class, I was happy to have some  fun with them. It began that my friend got invited from a girl from our  class (90% of the people there were from our class) and I asked him if I  could come along. He said yes and he was happy, because he is a pretty  unsecure person and wasn't completely sure if he goes to the party(the  ""party"" is just a couple of people next to the river channel drinking  some alcohol etc.). So we went to that party and drank a little bit and  had some fun. The girl that invited him talked with him a lot, but I  thought this was because she liked him more than a friend. But he also  got into some chats with a girl thats normally also a little shy and  temperated(she got also long black hair, so I will refer to her as girl  with black hair, she's 18), so I was a little bit confused.

At  the second time partying, it was even more noticeable that some girls  gathered around him. A lot of the time he sat next to the girl with the  black hair and they talked. She was already a little bit intoxicated, so  she did things like resting her head on his shoulder etc. But not only  she was talking with him, also the girl that invited him aswell as an  other girl thats (atleast in my oppinion) one of the prettiest girls I  know from our school. While he was talking to a lot of them, I also  tried to talk to some girls. But every girl I spoke to, didn't seem very  interested in a conversation with me, so I never came into a longer  chat.  I also tried to sit next to them, tried making new chats with  them aswell as helping them, for example at the time the black haired  girl was a little drunk, I suggested keeping an eye on her while the  others are somewhere else. We went home at 2:00 am, and because the  subway wasn't running at this time, we had to go home. So my friend, the  black haired girl and me are walking back home, because we got the same  general direction. She was a little bit scared, so she cuddled herself  to my friend.

And  thats the thing I don't get. Why is he talking to every girl for hours,  while I am just talking to a girl that seemed the most interested for a  few minutes? I don't want to be a bad friend and be jealous on all the  girls, but I am asking myself, what am I doing wrong? I don't know if  it's because how I look (I would rate myself as a average looking boy,  17 years old, 177cm and 65kg and I got long brown hair, thats tied to a  bun) or maybe just how I am as a person. Because at the beginning of the  conversations the girls seemed interested in a chat, but I got the  feeling that during the talking they lost the interest. Also I had to  begin the chat everytime. I would rate my friend also as average  looking, he is pretty thin and \~180cm big and is not really good in  social skills, he is unsecure and a bit fidgety.

The  reason why thats so deppressing for me is because I want to be part of  the class and the people, I want to have a good time with everybody.  Also, I would really like to have an girlfriend, so I am trying to talk  to a lot of girls, especially the black haired one, because I really  like her. But ever time I talk to girls, it seems that they don't want  to speak with me etc. And I don't know why that is, because I would say I  am at the same ""level"" as my friend, or I would rate me even a little  bit higher, but nevertheless everybody is talking with him, and nobody  with me. I don't know if it is because I was never originally invited or  that I am jsut as a person not so attractive, or maybe there's a other  reason I don't know. And at this point I begin to overthink the whole  situation, and I'm telling myself that maybe it's because they actually  want to get to me, because sometimes some girls look to me while they  whisper to each other, so I am even more confused what they want from  me.

Any advice? Because this whole thing has depressed me for the last few days and I dont know how to handle this situation.

44,oeqlnx,1625559041,Can't get into anything serious. Am I lacking softness? (28M),"These last two years I've had lots of random hookups (mostly women I meet in person. Not on apps). Some for a couple months at a time, but never progressed into anything more. Recently, a girl I was falling for ended up getting together with someone else, distance to me was a factor so it might have not mattered what I did.   


But it has occurred to me that maybe I'm not being soft enough? A (girl)friend saw our texts and told me I was treating her like a hookup (the way I see it I was just super playful and super sexual, how we chatted definitely translated to how we interacted. Sexually the chemistry was insane and literally couldn't keep our clothes on more than a couple hours at a time, and since day one there was light bdsm contrasted by very passionate cuddling). But I wasn't at all clear about how I was feeling about her, just tried to be playful and fun and not overly emotional (which I think is part of the reason why the physical chemistry was there and so intense).  


Am I, as the guy, expected to bring up the commitment conversation? I usually let women do it, and pay attention to their subtleness, but it seems like when it's one I'm very into, I try to play it extra cool, and end up treating her differently from how I feel. (for example, I never initiated texts, she just hit me up when she was in town every couple of weeks). The fact of the matter is that I wanted to text her every day, but didn't wanna come off as clingy. When it's women with whom I don't care how I come off, I'll text them more often.

45,oeqrps,1625559899,Honey Moon Phase Ending?,"Hey all! I (22 F) have been dating my bf (23 M) for 2 months (but we've been ""together"" for 4.5 months). The first month we knew each other was spent together, then I moved for school, and eventually we made it official. I even flew with him across the country to meet his parents a couple weeks ago, so we are very serious about each other. But we are both experiencing some relationship anxiety that we have pretty much attributed to the honeymoon phase beginning to wear off and the fact that when we do see each other, it's a lot of time spent together in a very short amount of time (overstimulation maybe?). This makes for an unstable-feeling relationship, but we can both imagine that if we were together (not LDR), we wouldn't be feeling that instability, because there is literally nothing else wrong in our relationship. We love each other a lot, we are both very emotionally mature and open and honest with how we feel, and we want to be together in the long run. This is the healthiest relationship I've ever had with the most amazing guy. He summarizes his feelings as feeling like falling out of love but knowing that he wants to be with me and can't imagine it any other way, and it makes him anxious to be having these feelings of doubt about his love. He assures me that he thinks I am wonderful and that it is nothing I am doing. He thinks it is the initial ""high"" wearing off, and I know exactly what he means, because I was having those same thoughts about a month ago. I was questioning my feelings for him quite a bit, but it felt like self-sabbatoge because everything seems perfect and he is amazing. These feelings are pretty distressing and self-perpetuating for me, and I know they are for him too.

Neither of us have been in a LDR before, so I'm just wondering if this is a normal thing that people go through in LDRs, how long it lasted, and how you came out of it (or didn't). I really love him, and he says he loves me, so why are we doubting our perfectly good relationship? Thanks!

47,oeqv1i,1625560393,Girl I like giving mixed signals,"So I need advice about this one girl I like, I met her in January on a party and on that party we talked for 3 hours non stop and when I got home I texted her and thats where all this began. The first evening we texted from midnight till 6 AM
Since then we have been texting when she sent me a text lets say I replied in 4-5 hours and then she replied in 9 hours and then I replied in 17 and then she replied in 28hrs and this went on and on until we got to not replying for a few days to each other. Not leaving on read, just not opening the message. But when she did open the message she wrote a long reply and continued the conversation asked questions and so on. In Feb. I asked her out she said she was busy with school (she is 18 and so am I) and I said its okay no worries. About 2 weeks later one day in the morning I went near the area she lives (she is about 30min ride from my place) and told her that im going there to do some shopping and we can get a coffe if she wants it. She said she isn't in town and she really wasn't she posted another town on her story. From then we have been on 3 parties and I saw her on 3 of them and talked her on 2. The first party we talked a little bit and she asked me how I was and just small talk in general and I went home early because I had work tomorrow morning. The next party I saw her talking to some guy and I lost all hope I just got sad. When she saw me I think she wanted to go in for a hug because she like went to spread her arms but there were a lot of people around us so she couldnt? Anyway we also talked a bit there. Next party I saw her talking with the same guy again and then I saw her walking with some other guy with his hand around her hips. I didnt even approach her at that party and the next day she asked me was I there and I said I was and she said ohh how didnt i see you... 2 weeks after that I was talking on the phone on a bus station and she and her friend got out of the bus and I pretended I didnt see her to see what will she do. She tapped my arm and said heyyyy, I said oh hi sorry I didn't see you and she repiled oh you never see me. And so we continued texting and one day I decided to not reply for a whole week because I thought she was interested in that guy I saw her on the party with and so I did not reply for a whole week
When I opened her message 7 days later and started typing she instantly went into the chat and replied I didnt even finish typing my message which really suprised me.
And so we talked for a few hours again first time after 2 months we talked like that.
She asked me am I working anywhere this summer and I said yes and she said she is working too and told me where and from when. I told her I'm gonna come visit her one day when I have the time and she said I can come.
I visited her 4 days ago we talked for half an hour and she said she needs to work and can't let her boss see her talking this much on work. And so I went home and I reply to her texts after 4-5 hours and she replies to mine in the morning usually cause she works in the afternoon but since we are talking on snapchat, I can see her snapscore going up by a few even though she doesn't reply to me when it goes up.
I don't know what to do but I need to get this over with its having an big impact on my life because I feel down whenver I think of it. I dont know what to do next so please, give me advice and if any more details interest you feel free to ask.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oeqv1i/girl_i_like_giving_mixed_signals/

49,oercv1,1625562994,Don’t know if I’m missing something or if it’s something I’m doing?,"I went out the other day and long story short my cousin brought her friend, I didn’t think anything would happen, and she had a boyfriend too. She made some comments asking me why I’m not dancing with any girls (everybody seemed older than me at the club I just turned 21) and was calling me her freak lol, but somehow at some point in the night we get to talking one on one and holding hands away from the group. 

Long story short she said I was cute and said actually would actually use my  sperm if I was a sperm donor, which was a really nice and funny compliment. We end up holding hands walking to where someone was going to pick us up, we held hands on the car ride and that was pretty much it.

Now here’s the problem, I wish girls were genuine when they make moves like this, in this situation it’s kind of easier see things clearly. She has a long distance boyfriend I think and she probably just got carried away while drunk, but I’ve been in situations where I’ve had girls have sex with me and not want to see me again. 

I had a girl that I was hanging out with every weekend, I really liked her, I knew she was not the relationship type, and I kind of steered her in the relationship direction until she said that she didn’t want one once things got more serious (so she basically said that she thought it would be better that we end things). 

I’ve had female friends say I give off a very fun, carefree vibe, but that’s just my natural personality so I’m guessing like girls maybe see me and think like they can have some fun with me. That’s cool and all but honestly, without trying to sound all lovey dovey or anything, I just want a genuine relationship with a girl.

I just want something real tbh, and I’m tired of feeling like I’m just this girls guy for the night. I’ve been thinking about asking more reserved/shy girls bc they seem to be more loyal/genuine, but it’s so hard to read them so I’ve always been hesitant since never know if they actually like me. In my heart of hearts I feel like I have a lot to offer (in terms of like being caring, or being “boyfriend material) but I’ve never been in a relationship.

I’ve always been sort of shy and struggle with self esteem sometimes, but I wonder if my low confidence could be holding me back from going after girls who are better for me. Or it could just be something completely different, I have insecurities about being too dorky, not attractive enough, etc, but I’m just brainstorming.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oercv1/dont_know_if_im_missing_something_or_if_its/

52,oeri8e,1625563759,My Bachelorette moment when I am usually the DUFF.,"This has never happened to me before so I thought that I would share this experience from July 4th. I had no expectations for the night but I did not expect to feel like I was on the Bachelorette. I should note that I am not someone who is approached romantically often, a lot of it has to do with how awkward I am with flirting and the fact that all my friends are gorgeous so i’m usually the one overlooked. Don’t get me wrong though, I’m still outgoing and a good time but at the end of the night the men turn to my friends and ask for their numbers. On Sunday night, I arrived at a rooftop party with my best friend, Paulina, and it starts off normal; we chat around and take shots with guys but nothing comes of it. The party begins to die down at 1 am and so a handful of us are left hanging out at the rooftop apartment. I was with Paulina, her boyfriend Cole, and his two friends whom I just met for the first time, Alex and Gary. At this point, I’m drunk and like most people I get less awkward when I’m drunk. I was flirting with Alex and Gary but nothing too serious. We decide to go swimming around 2 am and we invite a few more friends to join. Alex and Gary separate themselves and go into the hot tub and ask only me to join them. I enter the hot tub and they both keep lifting their feet up so I ask why. Alex says “Look at how big Gary’s feet are. but you know my d*ck is still bigger.” I was surprised about that last bit because there was no sexual nature in our environment at all prior. Out of the blue, Gary puts his arms around me and starts complimenting me but it makes me uncomfortable. I’m not a very confrontational person, so I just say I’m going to go back into the pool with my other friends. I start feeling awkward because I am deadass wearing my underwear and br* in the pool because I didn’t have a swimsuit, I didn’t feel weird before because our interactions were light hearted flirting but now it’s progressed further and I realize half my *ss is hanging out around these guys. I wanna add that I find both Alex and Gary physically attractive, but Gary’s pushiness makes me begin to find him unappealing. I go to the pool and start talking to my male friend and Gary gets into the swimming pool and is hugging me so I told him to stop because I didn’t want to do that in front of a bunch of people. He was starting to hover over me, when I moved around the room, he followed. When another guy flirted with me he would put his arm around me like he was trying to claim me as off limits and it BUGGED me. As time passed, we were sitting in the hot tub when Cole’s friend ended up joining us, Dayln. We introduced ourselves and in front of everyone, Dayln says a cheesy pick up line to me and everyone laughs but Gary, as you can guess, tried putting his arm on my back to “claim” me in front of Dayln. At this point, I’m annoyed and ready to just end my night because it was like 4 am. So we decide to all head back to the apartment as we were heading up a new friend joined us, his name is Chris. Things were calmer back in the apartment, but Gary continued to get weird whenever someone flirted with me. I end up being alone in a room with Chris and he tells me that he always sees me around and that he has wanted to try to talk to me. So we exchange numbers and he asks me on a date. I guess Gary got the memo and he separated me from everyone else. He tells me “You are so amazing, I need to take a girl like you on a date.” and I exchange my number with Gary too. I go up to Paulina and tell her about how two guys have asked for my number and Paulina tells me that Alex asked her if I was single. At this moment, I was shocked that all these guys were interested in me. So this is my interactions summed up: I walk into the kitchen, Gary comes up to me and is hugging me so then I make my way to the living room alone. Chris comes up and we are flirting, he’s putting his hands on my thighs. So I go to Dalyn, I end up somehow giving him a back rub. Then the next second i’m flirting with Alex. Like i’m having these moments in front of the other guys. It really felt like a “Hey can I steal her for a sec” scenario. Out of everyone though, I really liked Dalyn, he wasn’t pushy, he was sweet and goofy. There was a moment where he was reading a book to me and he had a really soothing voice. So I grabbed the book and was reading to him and he was just lovingly staring at me. He says “I’m sorry, i’m being creepy.” I said “why because you’re staring at me?” and he replies “I can’t help it.” It was really sweet. At 8am, everyone collectively agrees it’s time to end our ‘night’. I was kind of bummed out that I never got Dalyns contact. I was texting Paulina later in the day about how out of everyone, I liked Dalyn the most. At about 6pm Paulina texts me “So Dalyn just asked Cole for your number.” VICTORY!!! So I have a date with Dalyn on Tuesday, a date with Chris on Wednesday, and a date with Gary on Saturday. 
It was a fun experience to be *that* desired person because I normally get overlooked. I also don’t find any of these guys creepy or anything, keep in mind we were all drunk.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oeri8e/my_bachelorette_moment_when_i_am_usually_the_duff/

My girlfriend (M23) assures me she likes it when I’m sweet to her and mean everybody else (of course not outside the parameters of being polite), which I try very hard to do. 

I have a friend (M24) who is an absolute sweetheart. He’s such a nice guy and all my peers like him, he’s known around work as being the main positive energy. Unfortunately he hasn’t had much luck in the dating department. I ended up dating our mutual friend (my now current girlfriend) and I am trying my best to help him find a partner. My advice has always been to him, “friend, you’re really kind and sweet. That’s great. Keep it up. But women like a little bit of an edge. Be rough on the exterior and soft and gooey on the interior, be a little more sharp.” 

I am not sure if I have him good advice. My question, is women who are interested in men, how do you feel about male aggression? Do you like it only in certain scenarios? If so, what kind? If not, why? Do you prefer if your partner was more of a lover than a fighter? Or vice versa? How much of an edge do you like, if at all? Would you rather he deliberately choose to be aggressive or it be automatic, if so? 

I am defining male aggression not as toxic masculinity, but as a male’s ability to get aggressive If stimulated whether he does so consciously or it being a natural response.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oes5fh/how_do_women_today_view_aggression_in_their_male/

63,oesrhm,1625569750,What they really mean,"I am not sure if I should post this here since it's a gay story but anyway straight people can be related as well. 

When someone tells you he's not looking for a relationship or not looking to date now, what he/she  really means is I'm not that into you, but I will eventually date someone else. 
I met this guy last year, when we were chatting I asked him what are you looking for he said: ""I want someone to have sex with, if we like each other and it gives more in the future, I won't be opposed to something serious "", I said ok let's do it.

After a while I was catching feelings cause sex was good and he's my dream guy. When I told him that I like him and where things are going between us, he replied back "" I know you like me, but I'm not looking to date right now, cause I'm super busy with job, bla bla bla"", I  knew it was some random excuse but I couldn't let him go. After he started to distancing himself, taking more time to reply back to messages,  canceling on me etc... when I saw the situation were becoming unsustainable, I asked him to stay away from me, wich he did without hesitation. Last time we had sex was in March, after that total ghosting. I unfollowed on social media until last weekend I went to check his IG, and surprise surprise the busiest guy in the world happens to be dating a new guy, it was all over his IG, all of his IG stories were about the new guy, travel together doing things only I could dream of. 
I've been depressed for more than a year now because of him, im seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist, im on medication. But since last week after checking is IG, I feel like I'm the most worthless piece of garbage ever, a loser, a low life, an idiot who became attached to a man who were using me for sex only while was looking for something better. 

I blame myself more than I blame him cause I knew better but on the other hand he always made me feel like a complete obsessive lunatic everytime I confronted him about the mistreatment, saying that I'm overly dramatic, that it's all in my mind ect... Please guys, don't please with people who only have love and good intentions for you.

One day, we were hanging out and we started talking to this group of girls. I was talking to one and it turns out we are from the same state and frequent the same places. At one point this girl just kisses me out of nowhere. She was a perfect 10 and stuff like that never happens to me. She disappeared after that and then the next day we saw each other briefly and it was like nothing ever happened. I’m still sad about this. I could have hung out with her more there, gotten her number and all that stuff. This experience also has me fed up with people. Another group that was talking with all of us was a group of swingers (a throuple in their 20s) and they started hitting it off. I don’t know if this girl wasn’t involved in anything with them, but her friend was and I just feel embarrassed about how weird the situation was.

75,oeuejf,1625576289,I ran into a girl that I used to be crazy for. It messed me up,"To cut a long story short - I felt the most comfortable in my life around this girl ever. She's also a stunner as well. I just felt like she clicked all the boxes of ""What u/valli42 wants in a woman."" I know that's not enough time to kick the romanticization phase, but that's how I felt. 

 We hung-out 4 times and I'd usually spend the night and we'd get breakfast. We hooked up the 4th time. I get that's not that long, but it was enough for me to go ""I really, really like this girl.""

After we had sex I told her I liked her and I guess she didn't like that. I texted her a few more times trying to make plans but she always flaked out. Eventually, I just decided it was best for me to delete her number and move on.

We hooked up in December. We hadn't talked since March. I still think about her often, but I hadn't reached out more than a handful of times since December. There shouldn't be any bad blood between us. I never was rude or tried to make her feel bad for not liking me. I just laid my feelings out there and when they weren't reciprocated I just went ""okay."" I was unemployed, living with my parents, and 5 years younger at the time. I get her sentiment. She was kinda rude about it, but obviously I get why I wasn't a catch at the time.

I recently got employed and moved back into the city I met her in. I was grocery shopping and I looked up and she was right in front of me. Figured it would be better to say hi than to awkwardly stand behind her. She gave me a hug (I think) and asked where I was living/what my job was like, etc. She said she either missed me or wanted to hang out and I should text her. I told her I lost my contacts ( I didn't, I just deleted her number) and she was like ""oh I'll text you."" She probably won't but it was a nice gesture.

It just felt like Dazed and Confused by Led Zeppelin was blasting in the background. I won't get into details, but she didn't treat me well when we were hanging out. I was an option when she was bored.  Can't say for sure, but at the very least there's some emotional instability. I'm not saying this to beat up on her, but it's just what it is. Even if she were interested, she's not the best option for me and I know that. But at the same time I've never felt more comfortable around somebody ever in my life. She knows we clicked. She knows there was sexual tension. She just told me the night we met that she wouldn't date that much younger and I was stupid enough to think I could change that.

I guess this is all pretty much irrelevant at this point. I'm just ranting. I feel like shit. I had a dream about her. I woke up thinking about it. I can't focus. I've never really run into an ex or hookup before and it just fucked me up. If she does text me, what should I do? If she doesn't, how do I distract myself?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oeuejf/i_ran_into_a_girl_that_i_used_to_be_crazy_for_it/

77,oeuxb5,1625578082,I feel like a complete moron after a date bc I got ghosted,"I went on a date this weekend. Long story short I thought we had a good time but he ghosted me. I’ve never really been ghosted except one other time but it was bc something really bad had happened to them. 

Since being ghosted I have been just like- obsessively wondering what I did wrong. I care less that it didn’t work out. It was like a second date. But the dude has been persistently trying to get me out for a long time only to completely ghost so I feel like I did something really wrong.

I’ve thought about it a lot bc I have social anxiety that is pretty bad. Honestly I think I might have come across like I hated men or something when we were talking bc I mean I’ve had horrible experiences dating (not rly cheating but just people.... running over my boundaries and pressuring me sexually, people being aggressive or the alternative people just being really dumb and bordering like qanon when I saw them in person). I think I said a lot of things that when reflecting - probably didn’t come off too well even though he handled it well. But he seemed to get it and we joked about it. Really he gave me no indicators he had a bad time and talked about some of his past experiences as well. 

I don’t know if that’s WHY he ghosted me, that’s just my best guess.I just am like such a type A personality. I don’t like when people don’t like me. I don’t want anyone to hate me ever and I kinda feel like you have to have really negative emotions towards someone to ghost them. Like literally hated the date so much that they don’t deserve an explanation. I now feel like I was rude or something and it’s making me feel really bad. Esp since our circles are small and I don’t want people to think poorly of me.

I also feel like a moron since I texted after saying some cringe nice stuff- which maybe that also is the reason, maybe I was overly nice/showing interest. 

Overall, I am kind of just like disgusted with myself and internalizing the whole process now even tho I don’t even know WHY. I don’t care that it happened I just want to stop dwelling on it now. Words of advice? How to get my mind off it? Bc nothing I can rly do now except make sure to walk the line and be overly respectful during dates in the future

Red flag?,"I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend for about two months now, and we'd been seeing each other prior to that for a month. This past holiday weekend, we went to his friend's place for some grilling and a swim. I've met his friend and his longtime girlfriend before, and they both seem very friendly and welcoming. 

While we were all enjoying hanging out by the pool, I was sitting on the ledge of it with my feet in the water, while the other girlfriend was sunbathing on the lounge with her stomach down. She had her top half of her swimsuit untied and off to avoid tanlines. That was fine and I didn't think anything of it.

Soon after, the guys thought it would be funny to prank us girls as we were talking by running and jumping into the pool to splash us, but also they do so by doing it without their swim shorts on. Initially, it got a laugh but I was a little caught off guard by it. Right afterward, the girlfriend turned off with her top still off, and jumped right in. She and her boyfriend play fought in the water for a bit, until she put her arms around his neck and they embraced for a bit, which is the part that started to make me raise an eyebrow since he was still nude and she was topless. Meanwhile, my boyfriend swims over to me -- still nude -- and I jokingly asked, ""You going to just keep skinny dipping?"" 

Part of me wondered if he expected me to join in even though he didn't explicitly say it. I went over to the chair and grabbed his towel for him.

87,oew31o,1625581831,Why does a guy keep insisting that I block him after rejecting him?,"TL;DR A guy kept insisting that I block him after rejecting him.

There was this guy whom I met a few years ago. I blocked him before because I didn't like how he kept saying he fell for me. 

We only had one encounter and that was when he asked for directions and I was heading in the same direction. So, I walked him to the pedicab (cycle rickshaw) which would take him to his destination. That's also the time he asked for my number and I gave it - my mistake.

At first, he was nice but he was becoming a bit too forward. He kept calling and messaging saying cheesy stuff. I had expressed that I didn't like him in any romantic way but he kept insisting that I blocked. So, I did.

This year, a few months ago, he added me on FB. Today, he messaged me. I recognized his name and asked if it was him. He just said maybe. At some point, he said it's him and he's surprised to meet me again on FB. He said he didn't know I was the one he added because he was just adding random people to increase his viewers. He also said that he doesn't know why I blocked him. So, we were talking and he said he still loves me. I told him, we're incompatible and that he barely knows me. I also said that we can be friends but nothing more. He responded to that saying I'm ""swinging"" - whatever it means. 

Now, he kept insisting that I block him. I don't like being ordered around. Why do I have to block when he could just go as I've been clear that I'm not attracted to him?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oew31o/why_does_a_guy_keep_insisting_that_i_block_him/

I recently broke up for one month with my bf. My father never mentioned “don’t date him” but there were instances where he would kindly point out “observations”me about my bf. While my bf and I were apart I found out he had been on a dating app and got to see some
of the messages. He was VERY active on the app; hitting up lots of women for possible dates etc. claims he never went on date although I did find an open table reservation for 2. I am still in shock over that. 
Just gives me a strange feeling because it makes me feel like he just wants to fill a void rather than sit on his feelings  as acknowledge his emotions and work on himself. Or even realizing his feelings are not really about me being the one but rather he just wants any other women replace me. I might be too “romantic” or out of reality with worlds savage mode. 
in any case; a friend who highly dislikes my bf and got to know my father tells me he had a dream with my father and on the dream my father was curious if I were in a relationship with my bf. Claims my father asked him to take him to where I live and find out if indeed I am in this relationship. Upon finding me with my bf home my father told my friend “Look what I told you, she doesn’t get it”. 
I have been feeling SO conflicted since my friend revealed this dream to me. Friend claims was not going to tell me. I don’t know what to do with all since I do feel a shift in the relationship yet can’t help but feel like loyalty has eroded. Any advice please

I'm in my 30s and in my eyes I don't feel like I'm attractive or bring much to to table. I feel like I have no chance compared to other men with women. On top of that I feel like all the good ones are taken at this point in life.

I guess what iam really asking is how do I not go deeper into depression from all of this and the absolute horrible outlook on my future?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oew88v/cheated_on_and_left_now_im_stuck/

I started to date men after my awful experiences.
Giving the world another chance to find a man for romance. When I started to meet I found them to be cheats. Lying to make their way is all they try by what they say. In the hopes to get what they wanted when we first met. There were times when boys acted as men and now men act as boys and treat women like toys. Ripping them apart without seeing their precious heart. I needed a fresh start but I find myself in the games that men play to reach their aims. As they know they are smart and know how to play their part. To let a women fall for their charming way as they walk away

I'm just not really sure as I approach 30 how I would find people similar to myself, I feel like most people like me tend to keep to themselves and I am not they type to run up to a random person and ask them to hang out or in a date or anything.

I feel uncomfortable just telling a guy because all of them have already had sex.

97,oewxbu,1625584419,How to act after sex?,"Hi all!

A bit of context- I've been going on dates with a friend of a friend. We've hung out at gatherings/parties probably about 5 times prior to going on a date. We went on a great date together but didn't have sex after (because it was a first date and I have boundaries about sex). That being said, we just went to a party together for the fourth and the alcohol was flowing and feelings were there... Bottom line, we had sex. This is super not charectoristic of me because I know how sensitive I can get after sex and I wanted to wait until I had a commitment with someone. That being said- it happened! 

I'm trying to be chill but it's hard not to question where we stand. It's hard for me to not be emotional after sex and I don't plan on texting him but I don't want to be dropped because I had sex. Does anyone have advice for the post-sex emotional tailspin? Lol",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oewxbu/how_to_act_after_sex/
98,oewxp4,1625584449,Should I move for dating?,"I woke myself up by screaming in the middle of the night. I wasn’t having a nightmare. I screamed because I was in mental pain. The fear of being single in your 30s is tremendous. I see all the people around me settled down. 

I do online dating and it’s frustrating. I see women at work and they seem great but they are all taken. The women I see on OLD are just there for hook up or creepy. I tried OLD in a different country(UK) to see if the reason why I see these women is because of the location, and boom! I got matched with so many amazing women who are looking for serious connection. 

But I have a great career going here. I probably have to start over if I move. Should I still move?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oewxp4/should_i_move_for_dating/
