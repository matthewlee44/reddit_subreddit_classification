I guess it started when she hugged me a few weeks ago (the first one I've had in a couple of years). We were in the same (small) social circle for most of the pandemic and we've hung out both by ourselves and with others in our circle. I guess I have been feeling lonely since the pandemic started, and she is a caring person, which drew me to her. 

She is a very open and non-judgemental person, so I feel that telling her about my feelings won't do much harm, but I'm also very hesitant because what we already have right now is great and I fear she'll start distancing herself from me when she learns this (happened with a different friend years ago). Another issue holding me back is our maturity difference. I know 4.5 years is not a huge age difference, but she has seen much more of the world and is much wiser than I am. In other words, I'm afraid that she still sees me as a kid. I acknowledge this difference, and I am happy to work around it but I'm scared to see what she thinks. 

So idk, what should I do? Should I risk our friendship and confess? or should I silently move on?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nwa16j/catching_feelings_for_a_friend_what_to_do/

I am a bottom of the barrel type of guy to them. I‚Äôve felt proud of my achievements in other things and some people told me a lot of bullshit about what those achievements meant. Some people told me a lot of bullshit about a lot of things over the years. But nothing I have ever done earns me anything. And nothing I have ever done is attractive to anyone. It never has been. That is extremely clear to me now.

I am a bottom of the barrel kind of guy. No matter what I do. There is no defense for it. A lot of people completely hate me for being that. Because you can‚Äôt help but hate yourself when you are that. And you can‚Äôt help but hate your life when this is reality. And people hate you for the bitter person this turns you into. But it is what I am.

I am a man in his 30s that has never had a girlfriend. I am someone a lot of people really hate. And I‚Äôm sorry for being this. But it is what I am. I can either kill myself or continue being what I am. So here I am.

Whenever I match with a girl whos probably like a 4-5, she always sends dry answers, and acts super entitled. Many of them don‚Äôt have actual jobs but I still gave it a shot and asked a couple of them out to which they said ‚Äúsure lets grab drinks‚Äù only to which they never suggest times that they are available or they just flat out ghost after that saying that. When I have met with them (grain of salt because its probably 3/7 dates I‚Äôve had) they show up excessively late like 30 minutes, and/or don‚Äôt look like their profile pictures (+20 pounds). Obviously its a huge turn off and I‚Äôve even had one of them expect me to have sex by pushing to come back to my place after I paid a $240 bill (not all guys want to have sex on the first date too contrary to what people think). 

On the flip side, I usually have very attractive girls (7+) who I‚Äôm wondering how i‚Äôve even matched with, engage in meaningful conversation while showing genuine interest. 3/7 of the very attractive girls I‚Äôve gone on dates with were on time and genuine about what they were looking for without a bs excuse (the last 1/7 was attractive but she probably had the worst personality of all). Even now when I match with a very attractive girl, they‚Äôre more open to sending me over their number even if the conversation goes no where eventually. They won‚Äôt say ‚Äúlets grab drinks‚Äù unless they actually plan to follow through with it. On top of that, all of them offered/pushed to split the bill which I love.

I've talked to my friend about this and he's willing to help but isn't sure what to say or do because he's never done it before. Is there a tactful way we can go about this?

* Complaining about double standards is a waste of time because we all know it won't change, regardless of your gender.

25,nwcne5,1623291502,Getting rejected only makes me want her more.,"I am on the spectrum and lately after seeing this video by this figure on YT I am embarrassed to name, I set about asking out a variety of stranger women in the streets and getting rejected so that when I am faced with a girl that I actually have a chance with, I won't just pussyfoot around until my chance vanishes as though in a gust of wind. That's happened too many times for comfort for me.

So a few days ago I saw this girl whose face and nothing else I knew from my high school which I graduated from last year. She's still attending and is about to graduate.

She was with a boy and a girl which I assume to be her friends and after standing around, going to McDonald's to gather my courage in the form of an ice cream cone and heading back I awkwardly asked her number. She hesitated but she was smiling at me and her face was beaming it felt like. I got good vibes from her.

I then messaged her that evening asking her out for a coffee date over the weekend but she then said she lost interest because she wasn't going to meet someone she didn't know. A little back and forth on the arguments later she became more frank so I gave her the ultimatum of me waiting for her at a Starbucks at a definitive date and time and I told her that she could be there or not and that would be her final answer. After she said she wasn't interested and that she wanted to save me the trouble, I pleaded and told her that I don't care about my self-esteem, that I want her to do me this favour and give me a chance.

I think I got blocked on Whatsapp.   


Now I'm not sure what to do. I definitely will wait for her on Friday, since I think that even if there's a slim chance, she's worth it. Maybe she's playing hard to get after all and feels pity on me.

I could also phone her and try to talk it out, but my psychologist tried to make me aware of the difference between persistence and border-crossing behaviour.   


I just find it hard to deal with rejection from girls that I actually find interesting. The little exchange we had sparked genuine interest in her, but she probably just thinks I'm trying to get in her pants. Sex is overrated anyways.

Am I being stupid? Is this stalker behaviour? The harder I'm rejected the more I assign value to her.

I don't know if calling her is crossing the line when I'm already blocked, but I would like to signal that I find her THAT appealing that I'm willing to risk coming off as a creep.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nwcne5/getting_rejected_only_makes_me_want_her_more/

About ten years. We met at work. We worked together for seven months before he was fired for coming to work drunk. 

We got close because he started paying me for rides to work after he crashed his car for driving drunk. After he was fired we stayed in contact for a year n then stopped talking for a year. I hit randomly n that‚Äôs when the real friendship began. I asked him to take
My virginity n that began the situation ship I knew he didn‚Äôt want a relationship I didn‚Äôt want to be with him but I trusted him. 

He has emotional issues. His mom died of cancer a year before I met him n he has never stopped grieving. His grandfather who‚Äôs as like his parent who he lived with for our entire relationship died last year which was another major blow. He also lost his best friend a couple years ago. He has experienced a lot of lost. Although we are not technically together I‚Äôve spent most of our relationship being his support system.  Always there for him even to the point of helping him so much financially. 

I did start catching feelings we became so
Close he treats me like his girlfriend, tells me everything, brought me into his family and group of friends n his son loves me. He even mistakenly refers to me as his girl but states that as much as he loves me he doesn‚Äôt want to be in relationship.  It‚Äôs very confusing. But I have to say over this past year my romantic feelings for him are fading because I don‚Äôt feel like he is man enough for me. I don‚Äôt respect how he doesn‚Äôt work hard enough to put himself in a better situation. 

This year I lost my job. I have yet to receive unemployment but I am a freelance writer so I have some income. This year I have needed his support more than ever n he has let me down. I find myself helping him so much n I‚Äôm the one without a real job. He doesn‚Äôt ask if I need anything. If I ask for something he will give it to me though. 

I just resent him more n more each day. He has an entitled attitude. Everything has been about him. During sex he gets the most pleasure because he doesn‚Äôt like foreplay n refuses to reciprocate oral. 

We just had a argument because he said my last name wrong. I feel after 10yrs he should know how to pronounce my last name n he should remember my middle name.

Sometimes I feel used n taken advantage of but I also do feel like he loves me. Idk what to think but I‚Äôm tired",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nwd4jt/committing_to_wrong_man_for_years_vent/

I don‚Äôt want either of us to get hurt even though I know it‚Äôs sort of inevitable, so in that case, I‚Äôd like to minimize the hurt. 
Does that mean I need to end things now?Should I stop over thinking and just go with the flow?

39,nwe8rs,1623296756,"A strange, failed date","So I got rejected today, no two ways about it. The only thing I'm left wondering is if there's some kind of useful take away from the experience.

I was chatting with a guy online. Quickly he says he wants to meet, I tell him that's the idea but we should get know to know a little. Around this time his answers become less good; he ignores entire chunks of messages, keeps his answers vague and cryptic, repeats himself, etc. This combined with the fact he used a fake name for his profile made me wonder if he was cheating on a spouse or something, but unsure what it meant. When I notice something similar to a red flag, it typically always has meaning - the issue is finding how important or innocuous that meaning is. His haste about meeting also segued into a conversaton about chemistry a little bit, with him firmly in the realm of ""chemistry determines everything"" and me being in the realm of ""chemistry + making effort in the relationship determines the outcome."" 

So today we met, and things seemed to be going well. He looks like the photos and we're about evenly matched looks-wise, education-wise. The conversation is going well. But then 2 hours into it, he calls it quits even though it's still early. He says he didn't feel a spark and he has to prepare for work tomorrow. I'm like uh OK, and we part amicably. First date from OLD that was that short. Usually even after an entire evening I'm not 100% sure if there's real potential with someone, that decision seemed too soon. Looking back at the messages, I guess the red flag wasn't a spouse but him chasing after a kind of ""love at first sight"" feeling. Makes sense that he didn't see a point to answering questions; he wanted to quickly meet to see if I swept him up his feet or something.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nwe8rs/a_strange_failed_date/

Initially he still lived at home and he would sneak out and come spend the night at my house until he moved into his own place. I‚Äôve gone there a couple times and we‚Äôve hooked up there and i‚Äôve spent the night. 

About a month ago he unadded me randomly off of Snapchat and then we rematched on bumble and started snapping again. I played nonchalant and didn‚Äôt make a big deal of him unadding me. I like him a lot and would like to be in a relationship but I‚Äôm scared to make the first move. We snap during the day and when I go over there he talks non stop about his life and school to me before and after we hookup. 

We haven‚Äôt hooked up in months and i‚Äôve been avoiding it because i don‚Äôt want him to see me as just sex. Lately he‚Äôs been talking about me stopping by after work and stuff and i‚Äôll slide a joke like ‚Äúquickies are for boyfriends‚Äù which he responds with ‚Äúoh is that so.‚Äù But he‚Äôs still around and snaps me constantly.

It's been 7 months since my fling with her ended and I still think about her and the things that've happened. We didn't date but it was something special (for me at least), but I fucked up, and this is what really bothers me.
I think I need to vent it out so that's what happened:
I was with her in my home when she said she was hungry so I went to the market buy something to eat. When I was back I noticed she was a little strange, more quiet than usual. But I ignored. When we're finished eating I asked what was wrong and she called me a liar and said that I'd disrespected her and seemed to be thinking about something. I hadn't understand why she said that at the moment until she'd told me via msg something like this:
""Why don't you search my name in your whatsapp and see what you said to your friends?""
I was dumbfounded, cause I'd told two of my friends about some very unnecessary things about our intimacy, like what we did when we were together, you know. I was so ashamed of myself that I really wanted to die. 
I don't talk to her anymore and don't want to because there are some other things involved... But I still feel something after all this time don't know why. I feel like it will never go away. Can you give me some advice?

tldr: i was 18 and started dating one of my best friends who turned 16, i turned 19 a couple of months later, we have a 2 year 7 month age gap (jan 02, sep 04). their parents loved me and still do, all of our friends supported us fully, it was legal, i‚Äôve posted this in multiple subs and almost everyone has said it‚Äôs totally fine because it‚Äôs 2 years, some people had different opinions. everyone i‚Äôve asked in real life/close friends online have told me it‚Äôs totally fine.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nwf9r4/is_a_2_year_age_gap_bad/

So when a woman is insecure, its seen as acceptable and men wouldn't care or at least this particular woman gets told that men would still go after her. However, when a man is insecure people basically call him names and say no woman will go after him. So why does this double standard exist? Why exactly are women exempt from being insecure in certain situations, whereas men can't be in any way? Because from what i've noticed about posts with women being insecure is that people basically coddle her and say to her that her insecurities aren't a problem, they even try to remediate them. But when a guy posts that hes insecure there are several people that state ""you will never find women that will like you because you are insecure."" ""Insecurity is s turn off, good luck finding women with your insecurity."" ""Be confident, I can tell women don't like you because of your insecurity."" A lot of these comments are completely fucked up. Its not like you're even trying to help men with their insecurity problems, but you make them worse whereas when women have these issues people try to dodge the fact that shes insecure and literally just coddle women.

After a year of learning and loving myself, I genuinelly feel confused about why I should seek a romantic relationship? There is nothing that I really NEED a partner for, nothing important that I can't do or give myself at this point of my life. I feel secure and good by myself. I have loving friendships and I'm even working on strengthening my relationship with my family.

I've learned that, in the past I've ""needed"" a boyfriend because I wanted to escape myself and focus on something external. Or it's been pressure from my enviroment, not wanting to be the only single one or maybe even the fear of looking alone and like ""I don't have anyone"".

Why do we need romantic relationships? Is there something I'm missing out on that I can't see?

70,nwh5bo,1623307783,Improving dating prospects over the summer,"I'm living with my family during the summer, so it's not a good time to date. I'll be back at college by the end of August, at which point I'll start going on dates. However, I might as well do something in the meantime to improve my prospects. Here's what I've already considered:

Continuing to work on my interests: This should be common sense, yet I hear this advice getting thrown around all the time. I'm not gonna quit my hobbies and interests.

Exercise: I had already planned to walk outside more, do some pushups, stretch. Nothing as serious as weightlifting several times a week, just increasing physical activity in general.

Take Pictures: My profile has a bio listing my interests, a few facts about myself, and suggests some topics to discuss. I've got 5 images that pass all basic standards for clarity (right distance, not blurry, no bathroom selfies), avoid all common taboos, and portray various activities I enjoy while showing off my face and body in a clear way. As I've learned, just having above average pictures is not enough, so I'll strive to increase picture quality further.   

Improving appearance: I'm open to ordering makeup and trying various creams, gels, moisturizers etc. if that's what it takes. So far, I've just practiced standard hygiene: shower, brush teeth, floss, shampoo, wash face, which may not be enough. For full transparency, here's a recent image of me: [https://imgur.com/a/n3xCMiD](https://imgur.com/a/n3xCMiD) 

Here's what I'm planning on doing after going back to college:

Getting to know some of my friends better and asking them out: The gender ratio in my classes and clubs has not favored me so far, I know a lot of boys but not so many girls. However, at least I know some that I'm interested in and will speak with further.  

Online Dating: In case I get rejected by all the friends I'm interested in, I'll switch to online dating, which is why I mentioned taking pictures earlier.

New activities: I'm gonna join some intramurals, so far I see ping pong, ultimate frisbee, spikeball as potential candidates because I've enjoyed playing them in the past. My schedule is lighter than usual next semester, so I'll make time to rush for frats.  

Continuing current activities: I was in 4 clubs and am still going to actively participate in them next semester.  

So what else can I do during the summer? To paraphrase Churchill, I'm willing to put in the blood, toil, tears, and sweat that it takes to be successful. I know some people may say that you have to just relax, focus on your own stuff, and things will come naturally. However, there's nothing wrong with continuing your interests, enjoying life, and improving your dating prospects all at the same time, so such a remark is meaningless.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nwh5bo/improving_dating_prospects_over_the_summer/

76,nwilvc,1623313979,[32M] Nobody talks about the time investment?!,"I recently went on a date for the first time (and second time; different person). It took me this long to try it because of bullying for being fat in public school and mildly abusive parents; over the last several years I've worked through my problems and gotten into pretty good shape physically. 

 I've asked questions about dating/relationships/sex on several subreddits, and most of the answers were really helpful.

Why is it that NOBODY (especially other guys) brings up the time investment?! Yeah, it took plenty of time for me to work through my own issues and work on my physical health, but I'm referring mostly to the amount of time it takes to meet somebody, set up a date, and then go and make it happen.

And I found the women I dated through Tinder and Bumble, not through other means (pandemic aside, meeting people in person somewhere else would probably take more time). Even after taking the time saved via online dating into account, it was easily 4 to 6 hours of prep for each of those dates. Most of that time was spent putting extra effort into my appearance or cleaning up my car.

Spending that extra time made a huge difference in the way I was perceived, even with the limitations of online dating, but guess what guys! I have OTHER INTERESTS besides trying to put my dick into wet holes! 

Pardon the sarcasm, I'm just really tired of hearing other guys talk about this stuff as though it's all some effortless game. Even if I *was* just trying to get laid/have one-night stands, the effort and time investment would probably be the same, and it's nothing to sneeze at.

If other guys in my position read this (never dated before, past typical age, etc.), dating is a MAJOR TIME INVESTMENT!

My ex boyfriend is 21 and I am 23. We were together for 1.5 years. We recently broke up as he told me i broke two promises and humiliated him and that i have crossed his limit and he now do not care. When i ask him what i did, he refused to say it. He said he has given me chances but i blew it. Now we‚Äôve been on and off for 3 times now. What i do when im angry is before dumping him is that i block him and later unblock him because i regret doing it. I blocked because I thought that i was done with him. I am someone who is short tempered but regret it early (another thing that ive learned), when i look back on the things i did, i am actually thankful at how patient this man is, i would block him after i say what i wanted to and not wait for him to explain anything.

¬†But him &amp; i would talk about it later and get back together. He was really wiling. Another thing that he hates is when I apologise for being me (in my defence, he used to make me feel so guilty of what i do that i feel sorry for me and would apologise), i did these two the last time we fought and i think those were the two promises. Do you think i crushed his ego or devalue him? He once told me to listen to what he says and respect me.

¬†I think ive really crossed his limits to the point where he cant trust me anymore with anything. I feel bad. I was angry and hence does the things he told me not to, i made a mistake, im just a human. Do men really take it to heart when we devalue them? I feel extremely bad but the chances he talks about, I don‚Äôt get that, we don‚Äôt usually argue that much for me to blow all his chances away. He said we should walk our separate ways when i texted him the day just after we broke up, is he saying this because he hasn‚Äôt cooled down yet? Or he really meant it.

¬†I know he is hurting and he has not blocked me or unfollowed be in any social media platform. I wrote to him and called him even to tell him that i am wiling to change and make this work, that i loved him. He couldn‚Äôt answer when i ask him if he still loves me btw. I begged him, I apologised, i think i did everything i could in my hand hand but he just wouldn‚Äôt talk. Now I don‚Äôt have any hopes in this relationship but i wanted to know from a guy‚Äôs perspective. So that i can be better for the next guy I‚Äôll be with, God wiling.

80,nwj66j,1623316441,Who should I move forward with?,"*Cross-posted*

Hi reddit, I'm having a real dilemma here about who to continue seeing. I've been dating two guys non-exclusively, but I'm getting stressed out over dating multiple people and would like to define the rship with one of them soon. I'm 29F, doing very well career-wise and very much looking for long-term relationships that hopefully leads to marriage in another 2-4 years (as I want children) - I'm risk-averse and really don't want to invest time and effort into another relationship that might end. They're both pretty serious about me and want to move things forward.

Guy A: Have been talking since March, went on many dates since then.

\+ Great physical chemistry

\+ Great emotional connection - we've had a lot of really deep conversations, we both were open and shared things in our past we're not proud of and were non-judgemental, we talk a lot about feelings and are pretty vulnerable with each other

\+ He's fun, teases me a lot; we have fun together and laugh a lot

\- Sometimes he feels immature and childish in thought (e.g. the way he talks about other people or his own experiences)

\- Recently had a lot of arguments over differences in personalities/ styles. Managed to resolve most of them relatively calmly.

\- Has never offered to pay for me/ always wants to split the bill equally

\- Has pretty different views on sex and intimacy - he has a much higher sex drive and is also more liberal with sex, sees my lower sex drive as affecting physical intimacy. Had an argument recently where he's upset that I didn't want to have sex.

\- Less long-term oriented; told me he wants to be in a serious relationship, but also wants me to focus on the present instead of worrying about future marriage etc.

\- His long-term plans are TBD - super smart person but due to his field of specialization, not sure where his career is going.

Guy B: Have been talking since April, only met 4x due to schedule mismatches etc.

\+ I feel more stable with him. He's always talked about finding someone for the long-term, he's settled into a good job that he loves, and we share similar views on family/ relationships. He pays me genuine compliments, doesn't really tease me.

\+ Puts in a lot of effort into dates and always offered to pay (finding places, giving me options; I also paid sometimes of course)

\- Uncertain physical chemistry. He knows I'm more conservative and has been very respectful so far, which I appreciate.

\- Have not had difficult conversations yet (no arguments, no discussions on past secrets in depth)

\- Conversations are less exciting/ fun, he's more introverted so I feel like he doesn't bring up as many topics.

I know they're each their own individual person and so different but I'm really at a cross-roads here. Any advice on how I should proceed or even what I should discuss with them about to come to a conclusion will be appreciated. I feel like I like Guy A more right now but that may just be because we've spent more time together and have stronger intimacy compared to Guy B who I just haven't had the chance to spend as much time with.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nwj66j/who_should_i_move_forward_with/
81,nwjbch,1623317057,I (32 M) don't know if I should have a relationship or an FWB,"I keep putting out posts on personals subreddits and I don't get many women that are interested. I don't know if it's just people are still wary from the pandemic or what it is. Maybe I'm doing something wrong and I manage to screw up every chance I have. Maybe I should be less picky or something and just settle with someone I don't have any chemistry with. I just miss being close to people even being an introvert. I don't want to shack up with dudes that hit on me. That or go for the ""couples"" that are probably just one guy looking for a hookup.

Most of the time I'm ok being alone. I feel like people look at me weird because I don't have friends that hang out. People think I'm unhealthy for spending so much time alone. I don't really want to be so alone. They're mostly on the internet. There's nothing wrong with phone sex but it's hard to even find phone sex partners. They tend to be flakey and run away to the next person. It feels like Tinder, Facebook, and online dating in general is a total shitshow. I don't know what I should do to be honest. It has been a while since I've had sex. 

I met with one woman on Reddit a few months ago. I took a 3-4 hour bus/train trip one way to see her. Her and I hung out, checked into a hotel room, got food, and watched TV. We cuddled but nothing else happened. I read the situation and it felt like that was all the intimacy she wanted. She didn't seem to want sex. At least that was the impression I got from her. I'm not very forward and confident. I was afraid if I said anything about sex she would be turned off and think I was some horny pervert. I'm going to let her go and delete her from my phone contacts  I'll just give up any hope of doing anything with her. I don't know. I guess I just manage to screw everything up.

Sorry, I know this seems like a depressing post. Look I'm not a very extroverted person. I don't excel at social interaction like some do. I don't know what to do, if it's just me, the pandemic, or what. It feels like women don't want me. It feels like they don't want to be intimate with me. I don't feel like I fit in with a lot of people. I feel so off the beaten path when I'm genuinely myself. Who wants a dude that's an artist who does puppetry, caricatures, etc? Do I have to be some bombastic asshole braggart? I feel so out of place and it seems hard to find any woman who wants me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nwjbch/i_32_m_dont_know_if_i_should_have_a_relationship/
82,nwjbgo,1623317071,This trend needs to go away,"So in 2021 I (M24) have now asked out six different women ranging in age from 20-24 on a total of eight dates and so far I have had ZERO dates. That already kind of sucks, but the worst part of it is that I have only been flat out rejected twice. The other six times I got a yes, but no date happened.

Why is this a thing? Why say yes if you're not interested? When I was younger I thought rejection was the worst thing that could happen, but now I almost want to thank the two girls who didn't say yes because it's so much better to be told no immediately than it is to get a yes and then be disappointed when the date never happens. It's a lose-lose because not only am I extra sad and embarrassed when the date doesn't happen, but she's probably cringing the whole time I'm trying to schedule a date while knowing that it's literally a dead end. It just sucks because I get all excited to go on a date and meet someone new and cute who seemingly likes me, only to then be shot down in a way that is way more embarrassing, frustrating, and demoralizing. 

#1 forgot she would be out of town. 
#2 (same girl as #1) missed the rescheduled date outright, only telling me days later that she was in a funk. 
#3 met at a bar and got her number. Asked her on a date and got no reply, which I count as one of the merciful flat-out rejections.
#4 scheduled a date and she canceled the morning of. Said she would get back to me about rescheduling and never did.
#5 flat-out no from a girl on Tinder (thank you!)
#6 said yes and then blocked me several days before the date
#7 said yes but then missed the date because she wouldn't text back to help get it scheduled.
#8 (same girl as #7) asked her out again a couple weeks later since I thought she had been interested, but then she missed the date, claiming to have forgotten and offering to reschedule, but I found out through my roommate (one of her friends) that she only said yes because she didn't want to be mean by saying no, so I won't be trying to schedule with her again lol.

You would think after three or four my dumbass would stop getting so excited, but I just really want to meet someone and that yes is still euphoric. It's just such a bad feeling when you find out the date you've been excitedly anticipating was really just a disrespectful way of not having to say no. Sorry for the pity party! Oh well.

83,nwjfvo,1623317574,Has anyone else regretted rejecting someone before?,"So, I (F29) met a guy (M29) on Hinge and we went on two dates. He was honestly great, super attractive, fun, interesting and we got along. He also really seemed to like me, which was amazing. I feel like I‚Äôve had a problem in the past of dating guys that don‚Äôt give a shit about me, and I‚Äôve always made more effort and then ended up being rejected and ghosted by them. A couple of times I‚Äôve gone on dates with guys and immediately known I‚Äôm not into them, and I‚Äôve let them know, but most of the time I‚Äôve been very into the guy and ended up being hurt by them. So this guy seemed great, ticked all the boxes and I was excited to get to know him. 

Enter: a friend of mine. He‚Äôs a new friend who I met recently through other friends. We immediately clicked and I think I had a bit of a crush on him from the start, but I was also very aware that I didn‚Äôt know him that well and I also wasn‚Äôt sure how he felt about me. I sort of brushed it off as nothing, but still really enjoyed hanging out with him as a friend and getting to know him. A couple of weeks ago, this friend ended up staying at my house with my housemates and I, as he temporarily needed a place to stay. Over the week, my crush on him grew and I became more sure that he liked me back, which my friend who is good friends with him agreed with. 

Now, this friend. This guy is honestly the best person I‚Äôve ever met in my life. I know that sounds insane, but he‚Äôs so generous, kind, funny, intelligent and we click so well. I honestly think he has a flawless personality. I‚Äôve been hesitant about getting into a long term relationship with someone and I‚Äôve always struggled with the idea of marrying someone and being with them for the rest of my life. But with this guy, I can picture it. He‚Äôs just perfect in every way. And the chemistry and connection between us seems so strong. 

It was during this week when my friend was staying with us that I went on my second date with Hinge guy. This second date was okay, but I noticed some moments of the conversation not being that great, a few little things that I wasn‚Äôt that attracted to, and just a general feeling of something being off. I really can‚Äôt explain it because on paper, everything was fine. It was just a feeling of ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather just go home.‚Äù I also have to admit that I kept thinking about my friend the whole time. I went home afterwards feeling very conflicted.

The next few days I found myself avoiding messages from Hinge guy and not really being keen to meet up again. He kept pushing to meet up as well, which kinda annoyed me. I realised I just wasn‚Äôt that interested anymore, despite the fact that he was a really really great guy. 

At the same time, I started chatting more with my friend and he ended up asking me to hang out just the two of us. We had an amazing day together and everything felt so perfect. I realised that I needed to let Hinge guy down gently. I didn‚Äôt want to do to him what so many guys had done to me. I wanted to be totally honest with him. I told him that I really liked him and enjoyed his company, but I had feelings for someone else, and didn‚Äôt want to string him along. That‚Äôs the truth. I didn‚Äôt want to keep him on the back burner for later - that would be really unfair. 

I‚Äôve continued talking to my friend and am feeling really excited about getting to know him more and seeing where things go. I‚Äôve also had confirmation through friends that apparently he really likes me too. It honestly feels like high school haha. 

BUT, despite all this, I‚Äôm suddenly feeling regret about rejecting Hinge guy. I don‚Äôt get it. I realised I didn‚Äôt want to see him again. I‚Äôm interested in someone else. But I can‚Äôt help but have this feeling of regret that I cut him loose too soon. I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs because this is the first time I‚Äôve rejected someone who I initially liked. All previous rejections have been pretty immediate for me, but this time, we actually did connect initially. It‚Äôs just that someone else who I feel much more compatible with crossed my path. 

Why am I feeling this regretful? Is it just a weird psychological thing of wanting more options? Or not being used to rejecting people? I thought I did the right thing, but I feel weird about it now.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nwjfvo/has_anyone_else_regretted_rejecting_someone_before/

Hello, I've been dating since I was 17 and I've been in a ""relationship"" with plenty of girls over the year. But, I've never felt that I've been in love with any one of them.

I met this girl 3 months ago and we've met in person multiple times but mostly we talk on the phone for hours every night and text throughout the day.

I'm not a very social person and mostly stick to myself - focusing on my career and living life. Marriage and having kids have never been in my future plans. I've never cared about anyone else but me. All this changed when I met this girl.

3 months ago, I was at my lowest point in life - lost my job, zero money in my bank account, etc. To top it off, my whole family (parents &amp; elder brother) got serious covid, I mean the stats were off-the-charts bad. I thought I am gonna lose my whole family in the span of 2 weeks. Very low point.

She was there for me during this time. Making me feel good and happy and telling me everything's going to be okay.

Fortunately, everyone in my family got better. The next day, I get the news that this girl has been tested positive for covid. And I was broken. Shit scared of the idea that something bad can happen to her. But, she got better in just 2 days, as in no more serious symptoms. I was with her throughout this period, comforting her. Everything's happening on the phone.

Earlier, she had told me that she liked me but I told her that I don't feel the same. All this changed during this ""low moment"" period.

Things got serious. I don't open up to people and keep to myself. I opened up to her, emotionally. I knew that I've fallen in love with her. It just happened, I didn't plan on it. I didn't want to rush things.

But one day during one of our calls, I told her that I like her. She instantly told me she likes me as well. I was so happy. I even started thinking about a future with her. I mean, she's the first girl in my 7 years of dating that I've actually connected with.

No matter what I'm doing, I always thinking about her in the back of my mind. I see those silly romantic Insta reels, I think about her. I started imagining us in that situation and how good it would be. She became a part of all my future plans. I couldn't wait to talk to her and hear her voice. This has to be love, right? I've never felt such dependency on someone. And, I really like being vulnerable to her, telling her everything, and learning about her.

So, she has this exam in late August. Her career and independence depend on clearing this exam. I've always told her to focus on this and give it her 100%. And, that I am always there when she needs me.

Last night, she told me that she's getting serious about this exam. I loved it. I want nothing more than to see her succeed and be happy. Then she says, for the next 3 months, she doesn't want any distractions in her life, including me. I was bummed but I understand how important clearing this exam is to her. I was not cool with it, but I supported her. Then she says, she's gonna go offline till the exams are over. No calls, no texts, no Whatsapp, no Insta. Nothing. This upset me. I mean, you don't ghost the people you love for 3 months straight. We had a fight/discussion and she told me that she just wants to be friends with me and nothing else.

I don't understand this situation because I've never been in this situation before - constantly missing someone, getting rid of all my stress just by hearing her voice, and all the things I never believed in before.

She became a habit, a ritual for me. And now that it's over, I feel so hollow. I can't focus on work, I can't focus on eating, I don't want to go out, I don't want to do anything that used to make me happy. All my mind is thinking is was I in the wrong? Was I not good enough? I don't like doubting myself this way, but I've lost control over this. I mean, I am so hurt by her actions, and all I can think of is how can I get her back.

She's a genuine and good person. She's been so good to me. I want her to be a part of my life, even if it's just as friends. But I am finding it so hard to deal with all these emotions right now, mainly because I've never felt such attraction and such feelings before.

I know it sounds ridiculous..all of it happening in just 3 months without meeting frequently. I used to think this way too. But something changed when I met her. I've never believed in the idea of soulmates, made fun of people who did believe in it with all my logic and rational arguments. Now, my emotions are winning over the logical side of me. With her, I was so sure that I've found ""the one"" for me.

Tl;dr: She liked me. I didn't. Later, I started getting feelings for her, we got together. Now she just wants to stay friends.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nwk628/m_25_i_love_a_girl_she_said_she_likes_me_as_well/

Me: ""Hello. Sorry for the late response . I haven‚Äôt been on this site in a while and had almost given up on it. I just got a subscription to see the people who responded me and wow...You are absolutely gorgeous &lt;3. I wish you were here in the states though...Would love to meet you. I‚Äôm free to talk if you ever feel like it. No rush..I‚Äôm very patient.""

Girl: ""Hmmm ok""

Me: ""Good to hear from you! Not sure if you are still interested...I know these dating websites can be exhausting trying to find a mate. If you happen to have second thoughts, we can be friends for now....We can take it slow...Again, I think your gorgeous and would love to get with you. I love your flawless golden skin, beautiful eyes, raven hair, and even your braces. Very cute &lt;3. I‚Äôm actually getting ready to go to bed right now but I hope to hear from you again ‚ù§Ô∏è""

Girl: ""Oh thanks by the way""

HUH??? Like, WTF?.....F me right? Is it me or does she comes off as stuck-up? I mean.....She's the one who ""liked me"" first.....I would ask, ""Did I do something wrong?,"" but I guess the logical answer is that she just had second thoughts. This is the first time I talked to this person so maybe I'll keep trying but this doesn't seem like it's going to lead me to any water...Anyways, this is pointless.....I really just posted this to vent and maybe see if anybody can relate. Or I guess I'm also trying to say is, ""Please don't ""like"" someone if you are not even going to try!"" -\_-...This just annoys and stresses me out....",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nwknjd/wtf_can_people_not_like_me_if_they_are_not_really/
90,nwkub2,1623323072,Someone I am seeing is only interested in short-term relationship but giving mixed signals,"I have been in enough relationships that I know what's what....I think. I mention this to clarify that I know what type of affection is associated with certain stages of relationships.

I began dating someone. Knowing that they are leaving in 3-4 months to another country as her plan was to do a working holiday for a year. She approached me in this case so she kinda started this brief relationship. I think she wanted it as a FWB situation, but she knew that isn't something that I do.

Things seem to be going well. We are not all that clingy to one another to a point to be uncomfortable, but we both cannot wait to see each other whenever our schedule allows. Even when inconvenient, we will work each other in to our days. We are both adults so we control our own lives. It is clear that she wants to be with me as she shows the right physical affections, where we reach for one another to hold hands, hug, kisses, etc. in public and private. She surprises me with unexpected visits (the good kind, not where you check up on people). Messaging the right amount of back and forth and very playful convos.

Our sexual chemistry is going great. She was not willing to take birth controls before but she went to go get prescription for contraception as she knows I perform better without condoms. She mentioned that she has never let a guy be with her without condoms before but she made some exceptions during some heated moments.

Things are too soon for the L word, but the communication shows great affection for one another and I am not delusional about that part....at least I hope not. Everything points in the right direction telling me that this will lead to a meaningful relationship.

I told her straight out that I would be willing to wait for her as I find her to be the perfect fit for me. I have known her as a friend for a few years now before all this began, but I have always had a crush on her. She didn't feel the same way about me at the beginning, but she began this relationship, so I don't know if that means things had changed and this began at the right time when we actually both felt something for one another.

She told me that she doesn't want me to wait for her and she wants to spend these few months we have together as passionate lovers but let it end at that. I am confused as I have only been in long term relationships. I don't want her to end her dreams for me, but I feel like I am falling in love with someone that I shouldn't.

91,nwkzcs,1623323565,I may be someone's backup. Should I keep them as a backup or walk away for good?,"I'm a male, met a girl over a year ago and went on a couple of dates. Either I moved too fast, or she was still not over an ex, she backed away and nothing happened. But we remained connected on social media. We've exchanged a few messages since and liked each other's posts. Judging by her social media interactions and replies, it came across to me that she was not interested enough to date me, but was okay having me around and replying to my messages. Having said that, she's ignored a couple of my messages before which ended the conversation at the time.

The last conversation we had over DM, I asked if she wanted to meet again but she ignored my message. I took that as she wasn't interested at all. Fair enough. 

Over time, I won't go into fine details, it came apparent to me that she was interested in someone else. It wasn't a great revelation but I accepted it. And then it also came apparent that he wasn't interested in her. 

Now, it seems like she might be turning her interest back to me, based on her social media activity. I've not responded to her social media posts recently. 

I get the impression that I was a backup or she liked the attention from me and nothing more. I think it was more the former tbh. But right now, I feel like walking away and not looking back. Am I being unreasonable for feeling/thinking this way? Is the situation a red flag? Should I give it another go?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nwkzcs/i_may_be_someones_backup_should_i_keep_them_as_a/
92,nwl8pn,1623324454,How to decide if the person is the right one for a relationship,"I started online dating this year again after covid (M, early 30s). One of the girls I met I enjoyed spending time together and felt physically attracted to. We met several times over more than a month including sex by now.

What I'm not sure about is how to define if a girl is the right one or not. One reason of me being uncertain about this is that I never had a long term relationship. I had 2 relationships before that lasted about 8 or 9 months each. The previous relationship started similar to what's currently developing with the new girl I met. We met online, we are from 2 different continents (so there are some cultural differences), we enjoyed spending time together and became romantically attached. But after some months I felt that the initial exciting starting phase when every everything is new and fun was over and my feelings decreased steadily. So after some time the relationship was ended.

Now I'm wondering how to determine for myself what girl I can see myself with in the long term. We enjoy spending time together and like to see each other. On the other hand there are a few moments that make me think we are not that connected at some points and we don't share lots of mutual interests/hobbies.

So how do you decide if you want to enter a relationship/continue seeing someone you met? You just see how it develops or do you check certain points from the beginning?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nwl8pn/how_to_decide_if_the_person_is_the_right_one_for/

94,nwlnql,1623325836,heartbroken girl (25F) dating a heartbroken guy (24M),"Hi everyone!

Some months ago my long-term relationship ended and now I started dating again. I've been on a first date with a few guys and there's one of them I like, in fact, we like each other a lot. He's a super smart and attractive guy, our second date was amazing, I'd say it was the best date I ever had. We have common interests and great chemistry. 

Everything was perfect between us, lots of fun together, deep conversations, great sex, but one day, he told me he wasn't sure he wanted to continue going on dates with me because he's still destroyed after his last relationship :( I kinda was in the same situation but dating him helped to heal my broken heart.

One week ago he texted me again asking how was everything going, I replied and asked how was he doing, then he asked if I had any plan for the day after, and before I had the time to reply he had deleted the message. I didn't feel like asking him why did he do that so the conversation ended there.

Do you think I should ask him out again? I know he wants but there's something in his brain stopping him and I don't know what to do. I don't wanna push things between us but it's sad to see that two people who like each other that much can't be together because their ex-partners hurt them.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nwlnql/heartbroken_girl_25f_dating_a_heartbroken_guy_24m/

97,nwmd07,1623328007,What should i do?,"Hey guys. 24F here.
Started talking to a guy (26M) on hinge. Soon exchanged numbers and hit it off instantly, we had the same interests, likes dislikes and all that. After talking a bit we realised that i'm looking for something serious and long term whereas he's just looking for casual sex. We still decide to keep talking to see where it goes because we clicked really well. He soon started making plans for where he'll take me out on dates when the lockdown gets lifted (my city is in a lockdown still) which i thought was a little too soon to think about that.  Soon conversations started getting flirty and sexual. Told him i'm not comfortable with this and explained him why. He told me that even though he's really sexually attracted to me he will respect my boundaries. After some time he proceeds to flirt again and i again tell him that idk what to respond i get awkward with these kinds of things. Next day we decided to talk over a phone call. It went really well. I enjoyed talking to him. He told me about his past and a traumatic relationship he'd been in and thats why he wants only casual stuff now. I explained to him too that i've had a phase where i was only hooking up with guys and  i've had to deal with a lot of fuckboys and i ended up falling for 2 of them and that i've been ghosted too. Basically i have some trust issues with guys. So when any guy tries to get sexual with me now i just can't do it casually anymore and i get weird. I also told him that i like him and i am attracted to him too and that just give me some time for me to get comfortable. 
He seemed to understand. He also told me to not  worry about this and that he likes me and wants to stick around until i get comfortable with him even though having is patience one of his weak points he wants to do it for me because i'm worth it and that he'll respect my boundaries from now on. Next 2 days its fine, little flirty but i don't mind that i engage even.  But yet again after 2 days we're texting and he gets extremely sexual. We have an arguement again and i tell him to stop flirting he agrees again. After this he becomes a little distant. I try to talk to him normally as a friend would and try to get to know him more. I just didn't get the same energy back, conversations seemed forced with him now. 
I texted him a lengthy text basically saying i like you and i am attracted to you, but i need time to work on my issues and i can't give him what he wants so soon. But i would like for him to remain in my life as a friend for now as we genuinely get along well otherwise. He just replied saying 'okay, i understand. We'll be friends' that's it. But he hardly texts first anymore, i keep initiating conversations. What should i do? Should i just let it go? Or should i still try to talk to him?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nwmd07/what_should_i_do/
