She does that with her other friends when she roleplays with them they don't act like that. She feels bad it was her fault for coming up with a dumb idea.

3,rmblbr,1640198087,"I (31M) just got into my first relationship, this is my advice","1. Confidence comes from 3 things: 1: Your appearance (it's really hard to be not confident when you put efforts into your looks) 2: A sense of accomplishment from your actions. This means having hobbies, exercising or putting effort into other things that yield a result. 3: Experience with dating. The first times are always scary, if you feel your primary fear is your lack of experience then dating IS self improvement, even if you get rejected. 

2. Put effort into your appearance. I know we all think that nerdy guys aren't interested in looking good and that it is superficial or something. It is the biggest load of hogwash ever. It isn't just hygiene (which I always maintained). Put in actual effort. Buy new clothes, visit a good barber instead of the $10 one, try out new hair styling products, put on cologne so you smell nice, exercise, don't wear hoodies after highschool, always shave properly (or grow a beard). Don't just put in effort when you have a date, also put in effort when meeting friends. You might of course already know this, but subconsciously many people still aren't putting in actual effort into their appearance. 

3. Dating apps suck but might still get you what you want. Let's face it, the ratio of men to women on dating app is abysmal. Keep this in mind and don't get frustrated. Tinder sucks, Bumble and Hinge are ok, paid sites also suck because a really selective audience uses them nowadays. Take good pictures, step one: put in effort into your appearance (again), step 2 get a decent camera, step 3 read up on fotography a bit, step 4 get a friend or a tripod and spend an afternoon making nice pictures. Put them on photofeeler and pick the ones that get the best response. Also take pictures when you are out with friends, this is one of the reasons why you should also put in effort into your appearance then. 

4. Dating is a lot easier when you are happy. Ok I don't really like the crowd that gives a vibe that you have to be perfect before you even think about dating, but it does really help. I would not have minded if dates said no, I actually become friends with a couple of rejected dates. Don't be desperate 

5. Adjust your attitude in certain ways. Don't think in absolutes or that things exclusive. Appearance or personallity? both. dating IRL or apps? both. date or improve yourself? both. Don't reject ways of improvement because you feel ""you don't need them"". You don't NEED to exercise to find someone, but it helps, so why wouldn't you. You don't NEED that new haircut, but it helps, so why wouldn't you. you do need SOME collection of positive traits that makes someone interested in you.

I (23f) recently started working with someone who I have history with. He (22m) is a lifeguard at a pool which I am the receptionist at. We haven’t really had a proper conversation but I feel like he’s trying to get in my head/under my skin and it’s really frustrating me. They’re only really little things but I just know him and I know that there is like an underlying meaning/innuendo to everything he’s doing.

For example when he walks past me he’ll make really intense eye contact with me the whole way and smile or when he sees me looking his way he’ll like bounce his pecs and just things like that. But whenever I actually try and start a conversation with him he’s really short with me. I just know he’s trying to play mind games.

The final straw was when he passed his PT qualification he went around and offered everyone in the staff room free 1to1 personal training to build his portfolio, except for me. Later on when I asked him why he said “it wouldn’t be appropriate given our history”. But the week before he asked why I hadn’t invited him to a work drinks night I’d organized I said I didn’t think he’d want to come. He literally just laughed and said “yeah I definitely wouldn’t of” and walked off.

This just made me so mad because it’s just obvious he’s trying to get under my skin so I dmd his girlfriend about it explaining everything, and at first she was really nice but then it just started to feel like she was gaslighting me and telling me it was all in my head and not a big deal so I blocked her. Now it feels like everyone at work is being off with me and he hasn’t come in today.

But I don’t feel like I took it too far at all. We literally used to sleep with eachother for years on and off until he got with his current gf so I know what he’s like and know what he’s doing.

I don’t know what I should do at this point. Everyone keeps telling me to move on but me and him are definitely drawn to each other. But its not like I’m obsessed with him. 

Our relationship history is as follows:

We started sleeping with each other when I was like 14/15 and he said he wasn’t getting in a relationship. Then out of nowhere he gets a girlfriend and stops talking to me for a few months but then he started sleeping with me even though he was with her.

Then they broke up and we carried on as normal until he met his current gf and he stopped talking to me for 2 years. Then they broke up and we slept with each other a few times until they got back together and then he didn’t speak to me for another 2 years.

I’m 19, she’s 18, and we are about 90 minutes away driving. It’s an app used for meeting people near you online. Not exclusively a dating app, definitely not a hookup app. It’s also used for making friends and friendly chats1 that’s what I started using it for after my first relationship (1 year) ended 8 months ago.

But it’s also a dating app. I really didn’t care to match with anybody until I did match with a girl who, like me, is a musician. We also match each other’s energies, we talked for like 2 hours and meet each other’s standards. She gave me her phone number and Instagram name, so I got something going. 

She likes me, and I like her too. She’s asked mature questions, we have similar interests, she surrounds herself with good people from the way it seems, we definitely match each other’s vibes, and she is good-looking.

We both wanna “take it slow”. Rather not rush in and be more awkward than it has to be- of course talking to strangers online is more awkward than in person regardless of how well you get along. Also, wanna make sure we’re in the same headspace and on the same routes in life per se, which we are. We’re both in college (in fact we have the same major even!)

My question and where I need guidance is, with this context in mind, how do I “take it slow”? I’ve taken it slow in my first relationship but that was in person, and this is online.

9,rmcn0q,1640201003,Times when he doesn’t want to continue dating/sleeping together: One possible explanation,"In the past fifteen years, I’ve done my fair share of partner dancing in Latin America/Hawaii/Southeastern USA. One cool thing about knowing the dances as a guy is that many women love to dance. 

Let me tell you a predictable scenario that plays out anytime I’m at a dance club, house party, or just with colleagues at a staff celebration that has music -

-There are women who wish to dance. 

-They dance with me and enjoy the experience of having me as the person guiding the steps. 

-They feel motivated to return to that experience.  

The fact that I myself have studied, practiced, and continue to work hard to create a great dance floor experience for any lady I dance with - that’s something that makes me a certain type of dance partner… *it does *not*, however, make every lady I dance with a delight as a dance partner. 

With each different woman - maybe dancing with her ends up striking me very well, maybe it doesn’t. But I treat all ladies the same while performing my role as the guy smiling, leading, and hosting them for a dance. 

And the truth is that, it does not happen very often that I run across someone who feels like “home” as a dance partner. 

Dating - and specifically sex in dating - may be like that too for people today. 

If you’ve ever had a wonderful time on a date, as well as in the bedroom afterwards… but the dating partner later felt no motivation to return for another meetup - it may be that he was skilled &amp; effective at creating quite a nice experience for you… but that ability is something that makes *him* a certain type of partner… it does not guarantee that he will find *you* to be a delight to partner with. 

And if he later felt no motivation to return for another meetup - that doesn’t mean something is wrong necessarily (with you OR with him) - running across someone who feels like “home” doesn’t happen for him with every single dating partner.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rmcn0q/times_when_he_doesnt_want_to_continue/

I actually turned down seeing my family for the holidays because I thought I had it. I talk to and play games with her all the time. Her symptoms have been very mild and It kills me that she has to quarantine this week.

- You have to have humility and recognize that you need to improve. Don’t let your ego get involved, or feel that you have to obtain a certain result—be patient with yourself. Having fun and learning is your primary objective. 

- That being said, simply going on more dates will not help you improve. You have to be extremely observant. Observe what seemed to work, what didn’t, and remember your mindset at certain points. Remember the moments you were most comfortable, felt insecure, and when you were your most confident. Be honest with yourself. 

- Again, don’t go in with expectations. You are essentially learning a skill, which requires consistent real/world experience.

I also didn’t date in high school bc honestly I wasn’t attracted to the guys at my hs and I just didn’t want to date at that point. And in my first year in college, still no one really caught my eye.

23,rme9hj,1640205642,I felt pleasure for the first time since having my genitals removed.,"WArning: This is very nsfw for very obvious reason 

Hello, I am a 19 year old genderless creature. I've recently had surgery that compleatly removed my genitals, so I really just have smooth skin and a hole for urine (and a whole lot of scar tissue) downstairs now. It's the body I've alwasy wanted, and it feels so wonderful living every day without genitals.

However, there is an issue of sexual pleasure no longer being as easy as it was when I had a hole and a fully expsoed clit (gosh, it makes me feel so good just to think that *i don't really have a cervix anymore*). While perviously touching myself would make me feel ashamed to have genitals, now that I don't have them masturbation is no longer sad but it rarely produces any pleasurable sensations.

However, most of my clit is still below my skin, as are most of the other nerves from my old parts. Because of it I can still feel pleasure it's just a lot harder. (ANd honestly, never feeling pleasure again is better then what masturbating was like with genitals, which felt like sexually assaulting myself).

Luckily, I got a chance to feel sexual pleasure for the first time this morning. My girlfreind woke up and was kind of just petting me (which is something I really enjoy). She hasn't really ever wnated to touch my crotch before (she's very heterosexual, and I am not male bodied), but today she asked if she could do so now that I'm semi-recovered.

It was amazing. She was just sort of petting it, and tocuhing the skin. It felt really weird to have my new anatomy played with, because it's so diffrent to what I've had my entire lfie, like it's just so weird to have fingers touching a peice of skin that wasn't always there. But it also felt so wonderfu, like this is how I was always meant to be loved, and my gf is so gentle yet so powerful like a scalpel or a rapier. It just all felt so right. The actual feeling seperated from the gender euphoria wasn't much more pleasurable then having one of my breasts rubbed, but thje emotions made it feel so amazing.

25,rmevre,1640207393,How to handle this situation? Should I call her out or just block her?,"I'm pretty heated. Matched with this fit, single mom that's in her early 20's around my area on tinder. Had a good back and forth. Got her number and insta and chatted. I schedule a date with her at a winery a couple days later and when that day arrived, I reached out texting her I'm looking forward to seeing her at this time. She never responded back. She had read receipts on and never read it. She was posting stuff on her snap story and when the time came, I'm glad I didn't go because she flaked.

 After a few hours go by, I call her out on snapchat nicely about flaking. She said she simply forgot and she was sorry (yeah, right). I did my best to address any concerns she had like whether she was nervous, etc. She said she didn't like wine. Afterwards, I reached out to set up a hiking date, she agreed because it's something she likes. 

Once the day comes around, I reach out telling her good morning and that I'll see her later on. She then leaves me on read and two hours before our date she replies that if I could help her. I said what's up? and she told me that she couldn't receive text msgs and asked if I could text her. So I did. She told me she still didn't get it. I told her ""it says delivered."" She told me it's doing it with 6 other people and I told her ""well that's strange but I'll see you in a bit"" and texted her the address again. She saved it in chat. As I was on my way to the park, I had a gut feeling to check her profile on snap and I noticed she blocked me on it. 

I knew she was BSing about her number and I think she had me text her so she could block my number as well. I just don't understand how hard it is to agree to a date and later can't tell someone you can't make it.. Should I call her out again on insta, not to cuss her out but to be very blunt so she gets the idea that, that is shitty behavior in the future and never talk to her again or should I just block her.

I talked to him today about exclusivity and we agreed to be exclusive, and we both shared the last time used the apps. I said at the start, I had chatted with a few people but no dates, and he told me he was going on dates with another girl for 1.5-2mo during the time we were ""dating,"" (as in, we were already on date 8 / planning date 9 when he was going on a 5th date with this girl), but he ended it with her to focus on us. Though I'm glad we had this exclusivity talk, I'm not going to lie...I feel really shocked and hurt.

27,rmeylq,1640207621,Badoo,"Hi,

Anyone on Badoo here ? It seems like a ghost town. A lot of people create a profile but never comes back. I’ve paid 200 credits to write to many women. They did not reply or even check out my profile. I don’t even get views on my profile when I pay credits to up my profile in the search results.

The only active users seems to be women 40+ years old. 

It’s a shame because I like Badoo site format better than Tinder. On Tinder you only swipe right or left. 

On Tinder I wrote that I am bu-curious. I got like over 30 men liking my profile. I got a match with about 5 girls only.

29,rmf6or,1640208276,Looks Matter. It is clear women have a very strong preference for men with dark hair in the WEST,"I get tired of people over emphasizing the importance of charisma and confidence. Do they realize that the perception of these attributes are not equally distributed across the entire population? What then could be the variable the induces a reaction to these attributes. There must indeed be a catalyst. There must be a fuel source that feeds validation. Appearance is the common denominator here. 

If looks did not matter so much, then why are men with blonde hair dying out in the US? This pattern is so eminent. It is clear that women have a very strong preference for dark hair in men. But where did this originate. The media has portrayed blonde hair with youthfulness and femininity. Throughout our life, hair often turns darker with age. Darker hair is associated with maturity and masculinity. These attributes are what most women look for in a mate. They need maturity and a sense of security. The outer appearance adds validation.

Let's define male A and male B and give them the same personality. Suppose male A is very attractive to subject X whereas male B is very unattractive. Assume subject X has a past history of dating masculine looking men with dark hair. She does not prefer men with feminine features. Thus, let male B look very feminine and defective. 

Now, suppose these two males get a blind date. They both get a chance to put on a show for a set amount of time. To remove any influence of one event onto the other, assume her memory is erased after the first encounter (with male A). 

After these two events, it will be clear who will succeed and gain her infatuation. It will be clear that she will receive more reward and validation per unit time when in the presence of male A relative to male B. Thus, her interest level will be pushed in the + direction to a heightened degree.

Based on these scenarios, it is clear that as the strength of physical attraction drops, you must add more positive attributes to compensate because their perceived worth is dampened. It is an illusion.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rmf6or/looks_matter_it_is_clear_women_have_a_very_strong/

33,rmfwmx,1640210387,"I offer very little as a companion, so I don't date","Just wanted to share this as I see a lot of people struggle to date or find a companion by blaming others. I think you have to look at yourself first. Before you can ask what do I deserve from someone else, you have to consider what do I really offer as a companion right now? Do you cook consistently? Do you keep a clean home for yourself? Do you ever do tasks for someone other than yourself? Do you exercise, have hobbies/interests, a social life, goals, etc? 

You see, I find a lot of people just blame their lack of success on ""awful men"" or ""shady women"" etc. Everyone has an excuse that their lame friends will reassure them about. It just offers a false peace of mind that doesn't really solve anything. But the hard truth is people don't want to look in the mirror. If you're consistently finding yourself with bad partners, perhaps it's a cycle YOU perpetuate. And more than that, consider what skills or qualities you actually offer. Because it may be you don't offer much at all.

Everyone wants to be loved, but no one wants to consider what it is that they actually offer. People will say oh I'm great, I'm funny, a man/woman would be lucky to have me... Why? What are some concrete examples? Is it just bc people reassure you of this? What have you actually done to sacrifice and give in a relationship? What are some real world examples of things you will GIVE to another? I think if more people asked themselves this question they'd be more prepared to actually date.

Let's say I go out on a date with a woman and she seems like she likes me. There's a flame there (A very small one since we were total strangers until 30 minutes ago), but there's a giddy small flame.
My goal is to get that flame into a bigger one, and then into a fire and then into a roaring blaze.

If I shove my tongue down her throat, boom I just smothered the flame with a wooden log and now it's dead and she's getting tf out.
But let's say I end the date with a kiss on the cheek. That flame is now slightly bigger.

On the 2nd date, I put my arm around her while walking and playfully pull her into me. I then let go letting my hand brushing / holding the back of her neck. I playfully slap her hand a few times and say ""hold hands? For I don't feel like your 3rd brother.""
Now that flame is a tiny bit bigger.

At the end of the 2nd date, if she's lingering by my car, I gently pull her in and gently put my hand on the side of her neck and face and slowly go in for a wet smooch. We kiss a bit. Then before she goes I say ""Wait I bought you something. You're going to think I'm stuck in the 1950s, but here."" Then I open my car door giving her flowers.
That flame is now a fire.

Now on the next date there's making out. There's my hand on her knee and then her inner thigh. There's kissing on the neck. If we're somewhere private, it may lead to sex.

That fire is becoming a roaring blaze.

We're out of the city for Christmas and will be back for new years day. I mentioned to her that I'd like to take her for a walk to this beautiful spot, it's a hill that looks over the whole city, stunning. She was super excited about this when we were together, but hasn't mentioned anything since.

Once we're back, I plan to set a day for this and ask her to join. Hopefully she will. There's some uncertainty whether she likes me, so as long as this ""date"" goes well, I'd like to balls up and tell her. I feel like if she does like me, it could be super romantic to tell her on this hill, maybe we'll have our first kiss.

However, there I worry if this comes with pressure. First, if she doesn't like me, it might be super uncomfortable for her as we're on the top of a hill in the middle of nowhere. Second, if she responds that she doesn't like me, it would be a rather awkward 30 minute walk back to my car and dropping her home. I can deal with the awkwardness, and I realize it's a risk, but more than anything I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable.

Any thoughts? Could this be a great idea or could it be selfish? Should I perhaps wait to see if a romantic situation arises at the top of said hill, and then tell her? Or maybe just wait until I am dropping her home and tell her then?

I've been using Hinge and Coffee Meets Bagel to go on dates for the past couple weeks. I'm a 26yr male with an anxiety disorder and ocd. I've went on several dates so far and I met a phd student who seems really cool. I went on two dates with her so far and am waiting for the third one. She said she would text today to let me know if she is available for another date tmmr, but I'm still waiting. She is super busy because of her schedule btw. Which brings me to my biggest struggle in dating. I get super anxious during the time between dates. I am fine in person confident, happy, but I feel like I text a lot after dates. Often I check in on a girl (if I really like her) twice a day to see how she is doing. This phd student already knows how I feel about her, I told her I like her and miss hanging out. I told her I miss her even though it's only been two dates in less than a week... She laughed during our texts and was seemed genuinely flattered after I told her I miss hanging out, but I think this kind of behavior of mine might be overbearing on women. I've had long term relationships, but I think I'm kinda weird because of how my anxiety manifests, because it makes me text a lot. I started doing Tai Chi classes to help with anxiety and already take meds for my anxiety. I'm an engineer, I like logic, rules, etc, but I can't find any rule to dictate how often to text somebody or contact them. The only rule I follow is not to double text if you don't get a response, but if somebody replies to my texts I will be judicious in talking with them throughout the day even if they're at work.

Finally tried online dating because of the pandemic and it seems to be very difficult. I use hinge and bumble. I'm tall, fairly attractive, in decent shape and feel as if I'm a good catch. I can't get any matches on bumble and I can't get anyone on hinge to continue a conversation for more than a couple exchanges. I can't tell if I'm horrible at conversation, bad at flirting, or just uninteresting. 

Also being my age, I feel as if I'm in an awkward stage. I don't relate to younger girls who want to exchange snap to communicate, yet girls my age either seem to have kids (which I don't want kids myself. Im not completely against it but not ready to take on that kind of role at the moment) or they are leagues above me in terms of status. I don't have the best job. I make 40k before taxes but it's stable with 5 weeks vacation and great health insurance and retirement. I have had multiple women ask me what I do for a living and immediately stop replying upon telling them. It's starting to make me feel that if you're not in the top echelon of desireableness in terms of attractiveness and status you aren't getting any kind of relationship online. 

I have one match recently where the girl is really awesome. I feel as if we have a great connection and a lot in common. We have good conversation and have talked for a couple weeks but haven't had our schedules line up to meet in person. Now the talking has died down on her end and it ls just very upsetting and honestly exhausting.

He is sweet, caring, and extremely supportive, however, he wants no one to know about him. I told my mom his name and where he is from, so I hope he doesn't get mad from that. He says that he is well known, and would like to stay in the shadows.

He calls me 3 times/week and messages me frequently. He has been in the same state as me, so I felt close to him in some odd way. He recently got some sort of offer, he didn't really go into details, so he is out of state for the year.

I'm sort of a spoiled child, so I love being around my mom, and aunts, and cousins. I don't know how I would cope with being away from them, since he lives two hours away.

We spoke last night since i wanted to know what was happening between us and i expressed how ive been confused on this whole talk and situation. He told me he just assumed it was a mutual drunk kiss and that i wasn’t into him since i never told him.

So i asked him if it meant anything to him or if it was out of the blue and he said there definitely is something between us, but the moment felt right and natural as well. Long story short, he said he wants to take things slow between us and keep talking/hanging out like we have been since he never takes things slow and because of that, they never last. He also said he’s in no rush to date again, and wants to play things out and when things feel right and natural, have things slowly progress.

Hello,

I have a huge insecurity about having no experience. I want to be able to come to terms that every girl I meet will have a past and that I will never have that.

For example, I met a girl who I really like who has had a ton of hookups and ex boyfriends. I think she likes me but I have an insecurity where I feel like I don’t want to be with her because she has more experience that me. I know this is ridiculous and I want to get past this. 

The way I see it is that I feel really bad about myself because I don’t have a past where as she fell in love with other people and had “fun” with others while I had absolutely no one.

I’ve always thought that I could meet a girl and we could be each other’s “first everything” but I want to come to terms that chances of this very unlikely. I’ve gotten too old now for this to happen.

81,rmkn9v,1640224777,Do I forget about this wishy-washy guy?,"First time posting... I'm sure there's a lot of these posts so I'm sorry lol.
Matched him 3 weeks ago. 
He was very flirty from the start. He started being quite pushy for sexy pics, not in a rude way but just, kinda desperately after I added his number. I shut him down and said I'm looking for something serious, involving deeper emotion and that I don't really do nudes. I did send him one photo of me that wasn't on my profile wearing a more revealing top and told him that it was the limit and if he wanted more he had to give more (Not in those exact words but you know...) He asked to see more of my lower figure but I said no. 
After I stopped responding with that he finally said that it's fine, he prefers to take it slow and apologised if he made me feel devalued and uncomfortable. 
Next morning I texted him back (since I actually fell asleep before reading his apology) and the following conversation revealed that we both live incredibly close and work in similar fields. We also share similar religious backgrounds despite it being quite specific, and chatted a bit about that and more. He wanted to meet for a chat at a park near us but unfortunately I was busy for most of that week. We kept it going for a day or two until he suddenly stopped, so I casually asked if he was uninterested. 
He said - no, but he was worried about our age gap, to which I called out as weird since he knew my age throughout. Then he spilled that he needed to get over his ex and wasn't ready for a relationship even though he was curious and had a good feeling about me. I felt super sad since I am not stupid and knew what that meant. But I really was hopeful about him so I told him that we'll see what happens - it's a shame to never meet, not even once even though it seemed we had a connection. Relationships also don't happen in a flash anyway so we could just get to know each other more as people. Something to that effect.
He agreed. Soon we met up somewhere between our workplaces on an afternoon when we both happened to be free at the same time. I intuitively felt attraction between us and had a great time - I noticed he was so much more chatty and expressive in person than over text, where he is quite blunt and minimal. The pointers in text conversation that I thought he had previously dismissed, he brought back in-person, and he said he wanted to save those for a real chat. (He's a bit of a hippie and doesn't like online technology, which I don't mind since I also don't really like constant texting. He only really replies on average 2-4 hours after I text, usually on lunchtimes, afternoon break-ish times, or night time, though it's a bit irregular since he is self-employed) The conversation got much deeper than before and it was really nice.
As we were both going home he said he wanted to keep in touch and meet again, though again he reiterated that he will need to get over his ex because he still feels angry about it but he will soon. I think he also mentioned that there's something he feels angry about surrounding his ex and Christmas, hence his increased emotions around it at this time in particular.
He texted me to ask if I was home and said I was amazing... that I felt right, blah blah, bursts of short sweet messages. At this point I'm already kind of heartbroken and annoyed with his behaviour. I do honestly believe that he is /actually/ trying to get over his ex right now and not just using it as code even though it might be wishful thinking. 
Since then it's mostly been me initiating conversation, usually because 3 days or so pass with no contact and I feel the need to keep the connection. One time he has contacted me out of the blue was to send me a link to something we talked about that one time we met at like 6 AM. It was literally just the link and my anxious mind was popping OFF at whether this was a good message or a bad message lol. I've hinted a few times that he needs to tell me if he's not interested and he clarifies that he is. But again. He just... doesn't text. 
I asked if he wanted to meet again after another week or so to go to a casual drink-y type event (my main motive is that I would like to speak more in depth about the ex situation, though I have not mentioned that to him and haven't really pried about it thus far) but he said that he's probably not going to be available for the coming weeks. He had mentioned that he was setting 2 new big projects up work-related, not to mention it being holiday time (the ""coming weeks"" being Christmas and New year's) so I assumed the best and said OK.
I'm planning to contact him again after all these holidays pass if he doesn't say anything, but do I even bother? Is he trying to just let this fizzle if I don't stick around conveniently? I just don't even know at this point and I am so attracted to him!!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rmkn9v/do_i_forget_about_this_wishywashy_guy/

My main questions are; do you think I should do it? Is it inappropriate to send her a message pretty much out of the blue asking to go on a date? If you think I should do it, how should I approach it?

This is the message I was thinking of sending her 

“Hi , sorry for message completely out of the blue. I’m not sure if you’ll remember me ; we were in halls together at university. Basically I really liked you back then and I never said anything at the time and I really regret it. I was wondering if you would be up for going on a date some time. Absolutely no worries or pressure if not. Sorry again for message out the blue . Hope you’re doing well!”

Any advice would be greatly appreciated",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rmko9i/should_i_message_her/
83,rmkq63,1640225003,Do I contact a girl after getting rejected for trust issues?,"I’m 28 and the girl is 25. We’ve been communicating for the past 5 months or so and I finally conjured up the courage to ask her to become my girlfriend. 

She didn’t even take a second to respond and said that she isn’t able to trust anyone at this point because she was cheated during all 3 of her previous relationships. 

I understood her point and was willing to be patient with her but she didn’t show any sign of interest. She said she’s not the right girl for me because of her issues &amp; she genuinely believes we shouldn’t be together. 

She asked me if I wanted to remain friends with her and I agreed to do so. But now I'm confused if I should contact her myself or wait for her to make a move in this friendship?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rmkq63/do_i_contact_a_girl_after_getting_rejected_for/

85,rmkutx,1640225404,Second chance EX,"I found out that when my bf and I started seeing each other his friend (who is also his ex) was calling me ""crazy"" and trying to stop him from dating me.
Mind you, I had never met this person, nor had any interaction. All I knew about her was what he'd tell me about their friendship, and then sometimes the messages he'd send him when I was with him.
It got to a point where some of the messages were a bit inappropriate, saying she missed him and wanted cuddles. I found those messages by going through his phone because after awhile I just got super paranoid something else was happening. I did find stuff. But he forgave me for going through his phone.
He apologised for engaging and enabling her, and for not shutting those messages down earlier. He asked her for some time of no contact so they could both focus on their new relationships and explore a friendship later.

She messages like a month after no contact expressing unresolved feelings. That's when I find out she had actually been calling me crazy from the beginning and never wanting him to date me. Again, her and I had never met.
I got upset and he apologized for never calling her out on that behaviour in the beginning.
He made it clear that at present he doesn't want contact and maybe in the future (unspecified time) they could explore friendship but right now he needs to focus on me.

I have told him that because of her bullying ways I don't want her to be part of my life. In due time I can forgive and forget what she did and how she behaved, but that doesn't mean I want to get to know her or start a friendship.
He is quite a forgiving person and feels my attitude is rigid and doesn't understand how I wouldn't be open to forgiving someone and letting them back in my life.

She's not reached out again but I do anticipate it will happen, and I do still feel I wouldn't be comfortable having her in my life. I wish her well but doesn't mean I feel a need to get to know her.
Am I truly a bad person for feeling this way?
I gave her chances to be a proper chances when I felt uncomfortable with their initial friendship. Even after when her messages became a bit intense I was a bit iffy but knew his friendship with her was important. But since I found out she bullied me without knowing me and tried to stop us from dating I'm just having a hard time accepting her ever being part of our lives (or my life)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rmkutx/second_chance_ex/

88,rml5vl,1640226361,Should I ask my female coworker out if she's giving me these signs?," I (M20) have been coworkers with this girl (F18) and we’ve been working together in October 2021. I liked her ever since I saw her but we didn’t really talk at all until Thanksgiving when we just started talking to each other and we hit it off well.  
since then she would talk to me every time we worked together and offer her help. At first I just thought that she was just being nice to me and that she didn’t like me in a romantic way but lately I’ve been second-guessing that.  
this Saturday she wanted me to walk her to her car and Sunday she offered to share her umbrella with me when it was raining so I wouldn’t get wet and it was nice. Today she asked me a weird question that if I thought she was annoying because a coworker told her that someone said that about her and I told her that I didn’t think she was and that I thought she was the nicest person at our job. She thanked me and said that everyone at our job likes me because I'm genuine and caring.  
It meant a lot that she said that but I get thrown off because she calls me dude a lot so it makes me think she just sees me as friend. She’s also nice to everyone else so it’s not that she’s just really nice to me. I’m also nervous to ask her out because if she rejects me I don’t want it to be awkward at my job (there's only 20 employees at our job and 15 of them are women) which would lead to me wanting to quit which I don’t because I like my job.  
If anyone can tell me if by the info I gave that if I have a bad, 50/50, good chance of her saying yes I’d appreciate it because I need some other peoples perspectives on this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rml5vl/should_i_ask_my_female_coworker_out_if_shes/

However just based on the lack of attention from women I’ve been receiving since I started college 2 years ago, I’m thinking I am currently a provider type guy in the making.

98,rmm83g,1640229673,Dating is next to near impossible these days,"I just don't understand anymore. I mean I did what I was supposed to... get advanced degrees, land a well paying job I actually am passionate about, built my own house, debt free, continuously take care of my health/fitness, travel, learn new things, etc.

People say when you don't search for someone, that's when they will land into your life. Well using that logic, it's been a long close to 4 years of being alone after a failed marriage that ended in divorce. In addition to numerous dates that ended up in either me paying for a meal, but most of the time getting ghosted.

I tried getting back on the online dating apps, and received a decent amount of matches albeit hard are bots with others trying to sell their only fans accounts. The people that I actually do connect with either dont want to put in the effort of doing something LD for the time being and/or ghost.

My fear is that over time I will just lose stamina and motivation to find someone because I'm putting the energy out there, but not receiving it in the end. Even typing this post feels like a waste of time at this point because what is the point anyways.

I (as well as many others) were sold lies about how life was supposed to be life...but it wouldn't be that miserable if we had each other around yet it seems everyone is afraid to make any form of connection despite saying that's what they want. Now I can see if you don't connect with someone or dont find them attractive as a means for not resuming a convo, but do you really think holding out on somebody else better is the best choice?

What happens is all the ""good"" guys like myself and others here will get tired, and grow weary of making any connection while the majority of women who put their career and passions first looking for Mr. Perfect will come crawling back. It's not an easy game to play and I know Im not owed anything - but damn, at least have the decency to follow up on messages you decide to message on.

With that being said, If you care to be with someone who isn't afraid to speak the truth. That is, someone who values truth more than lies - message me because I'll say things the way they are. I say all this knowing Im not perfect...Im not a 6 feet tall (5'7"") but I can't control that.... I dont have the fanciest hair - im actually losing it but I do sport a nice beard . I may not have the same level of fancy talk like others, but I sure can outsmart most ppl with an IQ of 142.

I might be obsessed with things, but I have an insane amount of self-discipline. I might not have balance in certain areas of my life, but it means the things I value - I put all my effort and heart into, which includes love.

I thought love died in me, multiple times in my life but their is all but a flicker left inside waiting for someone to ignite the flames...but Im growing weary and the light is illuminating dimly. I feel darkness entering in and its such a lonely existence which makes me wonder if this is even worth it. Make me feel like life is worth it...make me have a reason to wake up each day, and I will do the same for you... make me have happiness again in my life because a life in solitude is mighty depressing especially during the holidays when you have no reason to be cheerful.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rmm83g/dating_is_next_to_near_impossible_these_days/
99,rmmd6r,1640230125,is this cheating even tho we were only dating,"I 23M met this girl 21F a month ago. We got pretty close i stayed at her place for a full week, and went on a few date. She was very caring, making me food all the time, and having a blast together.

We never talk about exclusivity or anyting but in my head it was pretty clear things were getting serious, we were dating. Today she brought me food, and told me she has to tell me something and she was very sorry and crying. Last week she went out got very drunk and kiss a guy. She said she had a panic attack, rejected him and went straight to the bathroom to call me. I did receive a call from her that night, i couldnt understand a word of what she was saying and hang up.

I know we are not a couple, but now im very confused. I don't want to be worry everytime she goes out. I feel like this is a big red flag and i should let her go. On the other hand i feel like she was very special to me, giving me attention, and she didn't have to tell me that but still did.
