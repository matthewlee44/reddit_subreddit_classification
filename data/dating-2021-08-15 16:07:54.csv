0,p5208z,1629062314,She's still hurt from her previous relationship,"She's 23f and I'm 24m. 

She was in a long term 7 year relationship with her ex, and she told me they had a prolonged breakup over several months. 

He has completely changed his life and now has a new gf and from what she told me, I don't think there's a chance they would ever get back together - they weren't on the same page at all. 

But she's still very hurt about having to move on from the whole relationship - she has to break up with his family, friends and from his life in general. She's still very hurt from that.

I'm willing to be there for her while she still processes things and she moves on from her previous relationship, i really like her and we're both super comfortable around each other, have so much in common; we're the perfect match :)

So this girl that's goes to my school, I like her, shes pretty closed off and only hangs out with a select group of friends. Shes pretty shy in my opinion when it comes to in person chatting

The problem here is that what if she treats me like one of her guy friends, and that if I tell her my intentions, everything becomes awkward.

We really had no plans and just kinda winged it, so we meet up at the mall, once I got there you could tell she was incredibly nervous. It was to the point where she would only talk to me if I started the conversation or asked her a question not once did she try to start a convo etc. The mall made it even worse because there was literally nothing to do, we just roamed the mall idk what I was thinking going to a mall for a first date. The date was so awkward it literally lasted like 15-20mins then we just left, after I got home from that awful date I felt so bad and texted her apologizing and she said it wasn’t my fault etc. I asked her if she wanted to give it another chance and hang again and she seems like she kinda does not 100% sure, She says she still likes me in all but yesterday date was just really weird which I completely agree, should I try and hang with her again and actually find a place where there is stuff to do? Or should I just call it quits and move on? The only thing I worry is if we hang again and she’s still very very nervous causing it to be a one way conversation making it even more awkward.

12,p53epi,1629067052,The Single Most Attractive Trait in a Person,"Picture young children dancing to music in a public place. The children often act spontaneously, freely, and without fear of judgement. The child's mind is fully in the present moment as he expresses his true honest feelings. Seeing such a child's performance most likely left you with a positive feeling inside.

Somewhere between childhood and adulthood, many of us lose the ability to express ourselves as freely as we once did. However, deep down inside we all still yearn for the freedom that the child embodies and for his unbridled spirit.

In a world where most are bound by rules and restrictions, there is nothing more attractive than a person who retains the ability to act freely with unapologetic authenticity.

Later when they started dating she told him she was intrigued when he did that like what is this guy who responded like that! Who is he? Now i am interested to know more. Well, they dated for 6 months but didn't work out later,she ended it as they realized they are different. 

On the other hand here is another story. A man in TED said he asked a girl out a d she said no so in his mind he interpreted it as may be the lighting was bad, may be she had a bad day? He chased her and asked again and ended up marrying this women. The Ted talk was a about confidence btw.

20,p53xvp,1629068937,Should I break it off or ride it out?,"Hey all. New-ish to posting on here, hopefully someone an offer some advice. 

I’ve been seeing this guy for about a month now, we’ve had about 5 dates and it’s been good so far. He’s easy to talk to and we like some of the same things. I know he’ll get along great with my friends.

Our first date was great, we walked and talked for awhile, and fooled around a bit back at his place, but didn’t have sex because I wasn’t ready for that (which he was more than okay with). 

Each of our dates plays out the same way. We walk, we talk, we have dinner and on all but one occasion we end up at his place to fool around. I can tell he wants to get more physical but i think he can sense my hesitation and always asks “Is this okay?” or “Are you comfortable with this?” As to not overstep my boundaries.

During our dates, I have a good time. But immediately after our dates, when I leave to go home, my mind starts racing and I find myself asking whether or not I’m happy to be out of the house on a date (after a year and a half of a pandemic) or whether I’m happy to be on a date with him. Whenever he texts, I don’t respond right away and, sometimes, find myself getting annoyed when he does text. The only time we’ve ever had a free flowing and continuous text conversation was when I was a night when I was a bit tipsy.

He’s starting to become a little more vulnerable in our chats now and I think his feelings for me are a lot more intense than I anticipated.

Im not sure I want to continue seeing him. I’ve been thinking of ending things with him but don’t know how. I don’t believe I’ve expressed any hesitation towards him, aside from anything physical. Because if this, I think he might feel that my ending things is completely unexpected. Im not a confrontational person by any means and don’t want to hurt his feelings but I just don’t feel a connection. 

Am I being too hasty or should I give this a couple more dates and see where it goes? Maybe we’re just better as friends? Any and all advice would be helpful.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p53xvp/should_i_break_it_off_or_ride_it_out/

25,p54clz,1629070427,"Where are thin/fit/athletic women? Do they no longer exist? Or if they do, where do they go?","Probably this is a side effect of the obesity epidemic but I am seeing fewer and fewer slim/fit/athletic women in the world. 

I would see some on the apps but they were all ""Instagram models"" who were probably fake or accumulating matches or didn't match me. People suggested meeting women IRL, but I can't even find any IRL.

I am fitness and health oriented, but I can't find any similarly fit or athletic women doing the activities I normally do. For example, I was at a resort last weekend, and I was literally the only person there who exercised at all. No one else I saw used the pool except to sit in the hot tub or swam in the lake. Everyone there was very overweight except the teenage waitress.

I go to my gym now daily or maybe 5 days a week. Almost universally there are usually around 30 guys there and at most 1-3 women. Today was a record - there were 4 women - two of whom where very overweight, one was ""normal"" (average), and one was an older lady. Rarely there will be a thin woman, but by contrast every day there are loads of dudes who look like they're on steroids and ripped, so it's like consistently 10:1 guys:girls (worse than Tinder ratios).

Today I also went to a public pool to swim for some cardio. Again, it was almost all dudes there. There were two overweight adult women who went with their overweight boyfriends to wade in the water and not swim. It was ""free swim"" rather than ""lane swim"" (though I still just did laps) so it was mostly teens and kids, but even for the kids it was almost all dudes. Besides those two women with their boyfriend, out of the 40+ people in the giant pool there were maybe 2 young teen girls with their parents and 3 small girls, and everyone else was a guy.

Now thinking back when I used to go for lane swim at another pool regularly, it was also always dudes there.

I go hiking and nature biking and I usually don't see ANYONE on the trails (neither men nor women). It's usually just me and nature or rarely some seniors. And even if I did, I can't see how I could meet anyone that way. You can't stop someone on their bike as they're riding hard or stop someone randomly on a secluded hiking trail to ""chat."" That seems creepy as fuck. Even as a guy if someone did that to me I'd be reaching for my bear spray.

Have women just stopped exercising or caring about their fitness? Or where are they doing it if they are? Is there any practical way to find them or connect with them?

The only places I haven't tried are:

(1) Coed sports leagues, though I just read a guy talking about doing that here and he said it was all dudes as well and he never met a woman that way even though he has done it for years.

(2) Yoga classes, because my flexibility is shit and I would be an embarrassment - working on this first then I will try, although I also hear it's ""creepy"" when guys join yoga. Whatever. I will try it if nothing else to check it off my list.

(3) Running clubs, because running is rough on my knees. Not going to do that.

I'm honestly becoming baffled. The funniest part to me is I work out for health of course, but one of the biggest motivators for me when I started was to become more attractive to women. That's the standard advice to men: If you're not succeeding, hit the gym!

Then the ridiculous part is once you do and start getting fit and wanting to date someone similar, there are no similar women to be found. Or so few it's virtually impossible.

Perhaps this is where the difference comes from? Men are constantly told every minute we have to ""hit the gym"" but I never hear anyone say that to women. If a woman reports having trouble with guys, I don't see 20+ replies telling her to hit the gym 5-7 days a week and how it will fix the problem. But that's the norm for men.

So maybe men just work out more and women don't bother?

I’ve (19f) been seeing this amazing guy (21m) for 2 months. He’s leaving for school and we’ve both agreed that we won’t label things. We don’t want too many expectations and for one of us to get hurt but plan to stay in touch. I’ll go up to visit him in November and he’ll come home for winter break.

I originally wanted a relationship and am open to one, but am also okay with going with the flow. We just had sex for the first time this weekend (it was my first time) and it was amazing. I couldn’t regret one minute even if I tried.

Before anything happened he made sure we were still on the same page:

“I really like you and I don’t know what’s going to happen, but I can’t guarantee you a relationship.” I told him I knew this going in and wanted my first time to be with him. He had a very bad experience with LDR in the past that resulted in him being depressed for three months his freshman year. He told me that we didn’t have to do anything if I didn’t want to despite us getting an Airbnb for the weekend.

After the fact, we were talking about how insane it was thinking back to our first date. He asked me what I thought about it and I told him that I thought he was so smart and down to earth and just a great person when we first met. 

He said “I remember seeing you walk down the stairs before getting into my car and thinking ‘wow this girl is beautiful’ and then when we were on the dock and you were talking about your writing I just remember being blown away. Like who is this girl who’s so smart and unique and has so many interesting things to say. It was just so refreshing meeting someone unlike anyone else.” 

This was the most transparent he’s been with me about how he feels about me. I think he was sort of holding back before.

Before we had sex he also told me that apart from his ex—it only happened once over a yearlong RS for personal reasons—he’s never had sex with someone that he was interested in romantically and that it was sort of a first for him too. 

I’ve been crying over this for the better part day because I care deeply for him and I’m pretty sure he feels the same. I think maybe letting things fall where they may is the best option for now. I also just had sex for the first time so everything feels heightened right now.

49,p56c0z,1629077849,Pretty sure I’ll be ghosted soon?,"So for context I (28F) have been talking to this guy (28M) for a few months. We met online and have been texting almost daily, and we also had some voice chats while playing games together..kind of called it a “virtual date.” It’s not so easy to see each other because we live four hours away, and I also have kids so it makes it hard to line our schedules up. He insisted that this was fine and he would love to actually meet up at one point. He has expressed interest in dating as well.

There was actually a few weeks that we stopped contacting each other, but then we got back into the swing of things and both expressed that we missed communicating, glad to be talking again, and so on. Idk if this is important or not, but I’m just throwing this out there.

Anyway, a few nights ago I didn’t hear from him at all, which is strange considering our normal talking schedule. He claimed he “passed out and slept for 14 hours.” Okay, sure dude. It happens I guess. The following day/evening, we talked like normal, although he did mention that he needed to cancel our “virtual date” which was supposed to happen tonight, and that he wanted to reschedule for Monday evening. His reasoning was he had some work related stuff Monday morning, so he can’t hang Sunday evening, which I get. The next day, (yesterday), I heard from him a little, but not much as normal. Now it’s Sunday evening, and I’ve barely heard from him all day today as well. I am wondering if he will even show tomorrow night for our rescheduled “virtual date”.

I am preparing to get ghosted, which sucks because I kinda like this guy and I feel like we click. But I wanted some outside insight. 

Also, if you do indeed think I’m about to get ghosted, do you have any ideas on how to cope? Cause even the idea is bumming me out and making me not even want to try in the dating world because of all the things that can go wrong.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p56c0z/pretty_sure_ill_be_ghosted_soon/

53,p56lq5,1629078918,Should I give him a second chance after outburst?,"Met a guy a few weeks ago that’s been wonderful. He surpassed all men I have met in his age group in maturity, intelligence, generosity, spirituality, emotional openness, confidence, etc. Always wanted to be around me, gentle and consistent, etc. Only red flag I noticed was that he got irritated easily - never things I did, but usually road rage, simple things that went wrong when we were out, etc, would cause an angry outburst. It didn’t match his sweet caring persona but always ended quickly and wasn’t so often that it became an issue. I had did some digging online.. and found out his mother was currently in jail serving 5 years for fraud (he doesn’t know I know) and he had told me his dad passed away when he was a baby… He was very touchy about the topic of his family. I figured it matured him early but left him with some anger issues. 

So we’re going on dates, spending nights together, he’s amazing and then yesterday afternoon he randomly left my place saying he was going to go see his mom… I didn’t probe. He was back in an hour and we moved forward with our day into a sushi date and movie. Sushi date was great but then the movie we saw was really bad and I could see his face changing throughout into anger.. He kept asking me if we could go but I wanted to stay and finish. He stayed but was quiet going back to the car. I asked him if he was okay, he said yes.. Turned on music.. I turned down the music and asked him again and he didn’t necessarily blow up, but turned very cold and mean. Pulled off into a parking lot and told me to get an Uber and that he should have just “left my ass at the theater”.. I was shocked. I could tell he WANTED to argue - the only thing that would calm him down was if I allowed him to start ranting about what he was feeling. I would see him forget about pushing me out and start going on in anger about his feelings.. But I didn’t wish to discuss it in that manner. He was yelling, it was dark, I just wanted him to take me home, and I told him that.. so he’d grow indifferent, cold, and simply tell me to get out. I ended up booking an Uber. The MOMENT I got the Uber, he suddenly calmed down, changed his mind and said he’d take me and give me the money back for it. I was silent and in tears the way back as he went on brewing in anger with how he feels he’s been treated while also adding in how serious he took me, how he would do anything in the world for me, I had him in the palm of my hands, but how I’ve treated him.. The entire ordeal I felt like his heart and mind were working out of sync. Like two people in his head were fighting each other - one wanted to work things out normally, the other wanted to act irrational. I didn’t do ANYTHING at ALL to this guy. From what he was going on about it, it wasn’t even making sense.. He was claiming he was upset that I wasn’t showing him enough attention!? That I could see how stressed he was and didn’t care! That I acted differently when I wasn’t. And that I need to learn how to “handle men better”. It didn’t make sense. I gave off positive energy all day, offered to pay at both dates (he wouldn’t let me), we’ve been intimate awhile now, and I was asking him a lot about his day and how he felt.

I didn’t hear from him all day today. But I just got this text from him asking if he could take me to dinner tomorrow so we could talk. I did really like him..

I was just thinking about how weird it is though that I never had sex until I was 24 which is quite late and then suddenly gained a sex drive and like after having a relationship I want to start dating again.

67,p57cai,1629081702,"Thank you all for the wonderful insightful comments, advice, and opinions.","As of right now, as a M(22), I'm officially resigning as a participant in the dating scene. There just comes a time when you have to throw in the towel, as the only way to actually win, is to try again another time and admit defeat. I've fought the good fight, spoke to everyone that I found attractive, put in the work where it matters, taken time to really dig deep into my inner self to become the best person that I can be, but it just isn't my time. Dating isn't something that can be rushed, so I took it at face value, and acted calmy, calculating my every move flawlessly, and remained content with what I have. I've always been grateful for my loving family, and don't really have any major issues mentally, physically, or spiritually. 

It seems that no matter what I did, I always came up short with the results, even if I tried my best. I'm going to continue living my life with the right goals in mind, even if being alone sometimes feels like a slow burn, sort of like a temporary skin hunger if I can explain it. The correct thing to do is just to live on and give up dating for now, at least for me. I hate pity and don't want anyone to feel sorry for me. Life is hard, and you don't always get what you want, but if I continue on as it is, I might become a bit bitter. Bitter not towards others, but towards myself. Taking a long break is just the only viable solution, and I'm happy alone 92% of the time. This isn't a post ranting about how hard dating is, or how I wish this or that. It's about accepting it for what it is and taking it as a life lesson we all should value.

77,p58f1b,1629085904,"""I'm average looking, why don't I get matches?""","There is a ton of confusion on here because people make broad feel-good generalizations about physical attractiveness. People constantly say that they date people of varying levels of physical attractiveness and use that as proof that all average looking people can get matches. It is important to understand that this is not how dating apps specifically work. Note: Obviously there are a lot of other factors other than physical appearance that matter in dating but for the sake of this post let's assume that we are considering two people who have the same attributes outside of physical attractiveness.

**Dating pools**

IMO, the idea of dating pools is rarely discussed here and it is assumed that everyone has access to the same dating pool.  
Before we dive into this, lets clarify a couple things:

**How do you determine one's physical attractiveness score objectively?**

It is impossible to generate a universal score of physical attractiveness since everyone's preferences are slightly different. However, it is possible to determine how an individual person would score physical attractiveness. One way is to get someone to describe what physical attributes they value and come up with a score based on the weighted sum of those attributes. However, this may not correlate well to the overall perceived attractiveness score because often the whole presents a different picture than the sum of its parts. So the only way to do this is to determine the score empirically. I.e. present someone with X potential partners and place them in order. That way, you can determine a score based on the order they place you compared to your competition.

However, note that **just because a person would date someone they would rate a 5/10 in physical attractiveness doesn't mean that they will date everyone who they rate a 5/10.** The reason for this is because someone can think you are reasonably attractive but still not want to date you because of a dealbreaker.

**What is a dealbreaker?**

A dealbreaker in this context is some physical attribute that someone will not consider dating you because of, even if your attractiveness on the other categories is high. For example, you could have a great facial structure, be very fit and have great hair but someone may not consider dating you because of your height. They may still rate you highly in terms of physical attractiveness because you look good but they wouldn't personally date you because height is a dealbreaker for them. The same goes for race, facial attributes, hair, etc. etc.

**Back to dating pools**

Even if you are decently physically attractive, you may not get a lot of matches on dating apps because your dating pool is limited. **You could have two people who are universally accepted to be about the same level of attractiveness but they could get a vastly different response on the dating apps.**

So what can you do about this? You need to stop comparing yourself to others and determining your ""attractiveness score"" based on how many matches you get. You have to realize that you may have a smaller dating pool and make sure that you focus on those who are in your dating pool and not worry about those outside of it. Your dating pool definitely scales based on how attractive you are and you should continue to improve your attractiveness. But even if you max out your attractiveness, there is no guarantee you will have as much success as a less attractive person who has a wider dating pool.

Regardless of the size of your dating pool, you will get spurious matches with people who are actually outside your dating pool but matched with you for reasons other than dating you (by accident, for attention/validation, wants something from you). But it will hurt more if your dating pool is small because you rarely get matches. In cases like this, it is important to quickly determine whether they are serious about dating you and unmatch them if they are not. Its much better to spend your time efficiently than waste time on someone you can intuitively feel is not there to date you.  


One last important thing to remember is that a lot of what determines your dating pool is not based on you as a person. It is mostly based on stereotypes, past experiences and just the fact that people have more comfortable/familiar options. It is important that you realize that your IRL dating pool is very different from your dating app dating pool and that you meet people in person too. Hope this helps people who are struggling and confused about why they aren't getting results in online dating.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p58f1b/im_average_looking_why_dont_i_get_matches/
78,p58v4n,1629087731,Feeling like you'll always love that one person,"This year I was in the most loving relationship I had ever been in before. He was the kindest person. We were almost never angry with each other.  Said good morning every single day before he left,  got ""hope your day is good""  ""how are you doing""  ""thinking about you""  messages while he was working.  Notes left for me with coffee telling me to have a good day.  For some people maybe that sounds needy but it always seemed out of a place of genuine love. It was like something out of a novel and I was so thankful every day.

We were living together.  He told me he was so happy with me nearly every day. He told me he wanted to be with me forever.  One day 1.5 month ago, he suddenly left me.  He gave me almost no explanation,  said he was taking a job far away that I was told he had turned down months before.  And just left. Moved most of his things out before he even told me,  while I was gone for the day. He took it all back the next day on a phone call,  but then blocked my calls and never came back to see me. Told me he ""needed to fix his problems""  and to ""move on"".  We never spoke again.  

We had been joking around about where we'd get married one day,  5 days before this happened. It's been well over a month and I  still wake up every morning thinking about it.  It feele so stupid but I feel like I love this person who just ripped himself away from me without a reason.

I know people say if they were right for you they would never leave you,  and I agree.  But god,  this hurts and not a day goes by that I don't wish to see him show up at my door.

81,p592nj,1629088635,Rant: Creepy man at coffee shop,"I need to vent:

I was at this Korean-owned coffee shop in the middle of Koreatown studying, and witnessed the creepiest thing by a middle-aged Caucasian guy towards an Asian college girl. He frequents this shop and looks potentially homeless by wearing a very faded shirt while lugging two large backpacks. Like other homeless' interactions, he's a bit too vocal when interacting with people/staff, and while he sits in the corner, he sometimes he talks to himself even saying the f word out loud repeatedly one time... I don't mind him being a patron of the shop, but what upset me was when he tried to hit on a **19** **year old-looking** (Asian) college student in the most disgusting way. 

She was seated to my left studying when the guy grabs a seat directly across from us and gives the most awkward smile towards her. For the next hour or so, he keeps glancing up towards her, but his face was so serious-looking that it was creepy. The glances weren't really glances but more like 10 second stares every minute or so. 

An hour passes by, and he tries to talk to her by saying ""Studying, so interesting"" in **Japanese...**  She didn't respond back and completely ignored him. There are very few Japanese people in this neighborhood, so why assume that she was Japanese??... This was so offensive to me as an Asian person. As if every Asian knows that language?? It also insinuates that this guy thinks all Asians are alike... If she were Korean, that would be highly offensive considering history, current sentiments, and tensions between both countries. 

My friends who were with me left. It was just me, her, and the creepy guy. She continues to sit at her current spot with me next to her, and leaves at the exact time I told a friends I would leave - 7:40 PM (I'm assuming she overheard at this point, because she gets ready to leave right before this time). She goes to the bathroom first, and the guy reaches over to her stuff and takes one of her napkins, writing a note before putting it on top of her stuff. She comes back, sees it, picks up her stuff, and leaves without saying a word to him.

At this point, I was livid. This guy has no common sense, social EQ, or intelligence at all.

To that guy:

\- Asian fetish is one thing, but don't be that guy that doesn't know jack about our culture and offend us. It's blatant that you just care about your fetish.  

\- Even if there is a huge age gap and the girl is 20, at least have the decency take care of your image instead of looking like a dirty man. Just judging by the way she's dressed, how hard she studies, and the way she carries herself, you two are exact opposites.

\- If she doesn't respond to your advances, take the hint and stop being creepy!!

\- Please date your age range... I absolutely could not imagine them in a photo together. A poorly dressed 50 year old with Tourette-like syndrome paired with a skinny fashionable teen with goals in life. 

Admittedly, I was also interested in her. With the way she asked if she could sit by me when she came in, I felt the interest was mildly mutual, at least enough for her to feel comfortable sitting next to me. I'm salty because the moment I was going to ask for her number after my friends left, the guy made his creepy advances. After he made his advance, it was like this creep shot both our chances. It would be totally awkward if I ALSO made a move at this point. Being 25, just starting his career, and single, I was curious to see if she would be willing to date and if we were compatible. I trust that if she really did overhear my conversations with my friends about when I'd be leaving, she would have also overheard how I frequent this shop on a scheduled basis. At this point, I'm leaving it to fate since there are plenty of other fish in the sea. I left offended, disgusted, and salty. 

At one point, I thought about showing her a message on my phone asking her if she felt safe that this guy was constantly glaring at her, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt that she could handle herself fine.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p592nj/rant_creepy_man_at_coffee_shop/

I guess I failed to be there for her, but I was being drowned by my own problems that I got a little disconnected. I then asked her if she had something and she wouldn’t open up to me. That’s when I told her that I was having the feeling that she didn’t want to speak with me. We talked very little and yesterday we saw each other and everything was lit. We cuddled for hours and everything seemed ok. 

I then go home and now she’s acting distant again. 
I confront her again, this time she explains that I am not there for her and that she feels awful and has a lot of problems and doesn’t feel supported by me we talked a bit about it, I recognize my faults and know that I could have done better.

She then tells me that the thinks she wants to be alone because she doesn’t need another problem in her life, of course this hurt like hell. I told her it was ok, that I was going to take my distance and when she felt ready we could talk about it. We both said we loved each other and it was it.

I know this is a breakup or seems really like one. My big question here is 

Should I really stop all communication with her and move on?

Or maybe 

Take distance but send her motivational texts and ask her how she’s doing without invading her privacy? You know being there for her.

I really love her and want to be there for her, want to be with her and want her to know that she can count on me whenever she needs.

90,p59otb,1629091344,My boyfriend send is still abusing me,"I've already put a post here so if you want backstory check my account.   


My boyfriend is still abusing me physically and emotionally, he continually beats me until I cry while healing at me calling me worthless and stupid to think he could be wrong. 

I cried myself asleep.

I woke up bruised and with a little blood on my face. I don't know what to do but I am terrified when he comes back from work. He ideally comes home by 8:40-9:00... It's 10:20 and I know he'll be furious when he comes home and dinner will be cold and I'm afraid he will beat me again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p59otb/my_boyfriend_send_is_still_abusing_me/
91,p59s5v,1629091787,Is it selfish to want kids when you have objectively bad genes?,"I've always loved the idea of having children. Some parts less than others (body changing, changing diapers.... postpartum problems) but I like the idea of loving someone so much that you bring someone into the world as like a memento of the love you two share. To really love someone enough to take on that responsibility is exciting. I want to have a child with someone I love. 

At the same time I think it might be selfish to want kids when mental illness runs in the family. Health wise it's nbd but I worry that if I have a child and they have a mental illness if I do something wrong in my parenting I will end up exacerbating the issue or they will resent me for having passed that down. is it a bad idea to have kids when you have problems in your family?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p59s5v/is_it_selfish_to_want_kids_when_you_have/
92,p59u34,1629092021,Can tall women be feminine ?,"I’m 5’7 women  and many men say they don’t have a height preference but many guys do .Many guys say tall women don’t give men shorter than them a chance but many of my tall friends are open to date men shorter than us .

I’m 5’7 and been rejected by men shorter than me , my height and taller .I had a 5’10 guy told me he’d go for me if I was 5’4 instead of 5’7 .

The weird thing is why do women wear high heels to tower over me is being tall is a negative trait in a women ?


Women in this society are prized for looks /beauty so being a tall women is a disadvantage outside of modeling .


Have you ever seen a feminine tall girl ? Are tall women even seen as feminine ?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p59u34/can_tall_women_be_feminine/
93,p59z4j,1629092712,Need help getting over something,I met this girl a few weeks ago and we had a great time spent the whole day and  night plus the morning until noon. And after it ended it just felt so perfect to me until she said she could pursue a guy and didn’t really want to be anything other than friends which was fine with me until she even disregarded that. And I gotta say I’ve kept my distance haven’t talked texted or anything to her since and I’ve been doing great until now where I’m in bed and I close my eyes and I see her face and that’s all I can see. I’m scared because I’m moving away from home and my friends in a few days and I don’t know what to do without the support they have been giving me.

98,p5a7dl,1629093811,Help on texting w/ cool girl after summer job ended,"I (20M) met a cool girl at my summer job (19F). We hit it off at work and from everything I saw from her, seemed she was into me (or she's just really bubbly, I can't really tell). We had an employee dinner where we talked and got to know one another and also she seemed to initiate conversations a ton while on the job. Her texting game during employment was also more emoji heavy than most of my other conversations with female coworkers at that time.

&amp;#x200B;

I was all set to ask her out (separate from work, of course) when I learned from my supervisor telling everyone that she was going to leave the job early in order to go to school early. After hearing that news and with only a week or so left, I decided not to ask her. It's been close to two weeks since she left and we've kept in touch through text. Thing is that these interactions via text strongly suggest she's not as into me as I observed and concluded while on the job. I still think she's great and would love to see her again when we're both back home from school, but I'm not sure how to keep that up. It's been a few days since we last texted.

99,p5a9eo,1629094070,Covid dating,"I (24 M) went on a date last last fall with a woman (22F) and really enjoyed it. We went out a few more times and nothing really came of it. I was working in 3 research labs and enrolled in all stem credits and ended up being very busy with all of that about halfway through the semester, so I didn’t really prioritize dating after that. After thanksgiving the university classes were moved to fully remote and I went home until January.  In January she popped up as a suggested friend on FB and I added her.  That same day she messaged me on FB and we have texted ever since pretty consistently and FaceTimed on and off (every week or other week). She didn’t return to the campus for the winter semester in January like i did because she moved home as she was enrolled in all online classes (so I haven’t seen her, but have talked to her for like 8 months now). I think she and i have a lot in common and would get along great, but I’m not sure if I’m being backburnered or not as sometimes shes very involved in the conversations and other times she responds, but after a few days - it wasn’t like this back in January.  So I’m not entirely sure how to interpret this.  Was she just looking for a friend during the Covid times as she was living at home with her parents?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p5a9eo/covid_dating/
