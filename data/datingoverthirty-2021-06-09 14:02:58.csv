http://imgur.com/a/Ntx1XpJ

Q: Do I come across as trying too hard to be liked? 

Q:  Do I come across as trying too hard to sound intelligent?  I mean, I'm honest w/ what I do outside of work in my 'geek out prompt.

Q:  Is it concerning or a '... flag' that I have no group photos?   I just dont have many recent flattering group photos &amp; I don't like when profiles are multiple group photos &amp; it's hard to tell who's profile it is.

I think I need better &amp; more photos of myself. I have too many selfies &amp; not enough 'action' shots on my profile or my phone in general.

Also, I could always improve my messaging skills as well as in person conversation.

Any advice or feedback is appreciated. Thanks.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/nw6wvs/35m_profile_review_inquiry_update/

75,nwvysl,1623352733,"Help me draft an apology, please","**My boyfriend issues:**

My boyfriend (29 M) and I (32F) became official a month ago. We have been dating each other for 7.5 months now.

The last two weeks have been rough; he is feeling quite depressed, focusing on self-care. He has issues of depression, anxiety, ADHD and uses medications every day. Since the last two weeks, he has stopped smoking weed, and I think he is feeling that; plus, he is feeling very depressed, has not been able to sleep much, his digestion is fucked too.

This is the first time it has been quite rough in the last 7.5 months (though our journey has never been smooth), but this time is particularly rough, as he complaints. He is probably very much burnt out mentally, exhausted both physically and mentally at work as well. But he can't take a day off.

**My issues:** Now a colleague of his moved here, and they went on a walk. She is gorgeous, and I have been feeling intimidated. And, since all these issues started around the same time, I somehow feel anxious that he doesn't like me or is not attracted to me. He said once that he doubts if this is the right relationship for him last week, but he said it is just bouts of depression.

**Situation:** So yesterday I called him and asked him why he is distant (not much communication over messages, not wanting to spend nights together), him telling me a week ago where he doubted whether this relationship is right, and he said no, infact this is depression, insomnia, burnt out and he is happy I am in his life.

After that call, he came to see me, and somehow, I thought I saw a pic of a girl in his frequent texter list when he was operating his phone near me. So my anxiety crept in, and finally, I told him that I think I saw a pic of a girl. He showed me his messenger messages; there was no girl. My brain tricked me into thinking it was a pic of that colleague of his though it wasn't. It was my brain imagining things that weren't. Now I don't want to blame myself completely, as it has been 7.5 months, we are not on each other social media, we don't have any pics together, he has not met any of my friends. He gets relationship anxiety etc. But, I think it was not the right time to burden him with my insecurity, and I have never questioned anything.

**Help needed:** Anyways, he said he feel insecure sometimes, so it is fine, but I want to send another apology, as I feel so stupid, especially when he is going through all of the above things. Can you please help me on drafting an apology? And, secondly, what to say to someone who is going through this?

I asked him if he’d let me figure out how I felt about kids while Still exploring the connection, and though he was tempted, he said it was a bad idea and he was worried he’d fall for me and then have to walk away. 

Since then, I’ve changed my tune somewhat. I don’t think I’ll ever be the type to desperately want kids, but I could definitely see myself having one And being really happy with that if that’s what my partner wanted. I could also see myself not having kids and also being happy with that, if that’s what my partner wanted. I guess the subtle change is that I could really go either way. I think experiencing parenthood with someone you love deeply would be really special.I don’t want more than one though.

I also tend to feel even more insecure if the other person is really good looking or is very outgoing and popular. I'm average looking, and more on the introverted side of the scale with a few good friends. I don't really believe that leagues are real but my subconscious mind keeps tripping me up.

Does anyone feel this way too? Does anyone have tips for getting over this?",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/nww8dc/more_confident_over_text_than_inperson/

Original post

So not long after that post, I did go over to his house. And there was nothing terrible-no hoarding, no wife/children hiding, no dead bodies. He is just intensely private with his space. 

It’s still been going ok with us- I kinda keep going back and forth on if I see a long-term future with us, but it’s been one of the better dating experiences I have had in a long time. He is respectful and we have great conversations. He is also amazingly patient and fun in the bedroom and has done more for my self-esteem in that area than most of the other guys I have been with combined. And that has been a really big deal to me because there’s been some pretty awful bedroom experiences. No matter what, I will be forever grateful to him for making me realize where my standards on how I am treated in bed should be.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/nwx5sb/update_on_possible_red_flags/

82,nwxfk3,1623356423,Anyone else struggle with aging?,"I am a 32 y/o female who has been single for a while due to various reasons. One issue that I’m embarrassingly struggling with is that I am not nearly attractive as I was even a few years ago. This has nothing to do with not keeping myself up, it simply has to do with the way that my face and body are changing. 

I was brought up in a toxic home and was 
forced to be on diets, wear make up, heels, etc. from a very young age. This engrained this terrible belief in my head that my worth was equal to my looks. I am a highly educated woman with a good career and a pretty fun personality. I know that there is so much more than being pristine physically; however, I would be blind to notice that with even the littlest bit of makeup or a slight loss of five pounds, people are remarkably kinder to me (men and women alike).

I knew that with my past, I would struggle with aging, but I need to get a grip on this considering that I will only get older and I truly would like to feel confident enough to date again. 

Any advice? Be kind (if possible lol)",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/nwxfk3/anyone_else_struggle_with_aging/

84,nwyixm,1623359176,I don't know how I feel about someone I've been seeing,"I (37F) have met a man from OLD 3x (40M). We've been on 2 dates and 1 home 'visit', not a date, he just came by while in the area. 

He's cute, and we seem to get along. We chat a bit almost everday. Share some interests. 

I just don't know what i feel? I'm completely ambivilent. Important to note I left a very toxic relationship a while back and have done alot of healing/therapy after it. I still have feelings for my ex, I might always, but we can never be together and he is an alcoholic.

I feel ready to date, and have gone on a couple with a few people I didn't click with but with this guy I just feel.. numb? I can tell when I don't like someone. I genuinely do not know what I think about this guy! 
Anyone else experience this? How many dates do I give it? I worry maybe because its lacking that crazy, unhealthy 'spark', I think its boring or i'm not interested.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/nwyixm/i_dont_know_how_i_feel_about_someone_ive_been/

How do you let go of someone and who else is still in the thick of it?,"I am hoping to talk to other people who are also helplessly caught up on an ex. What's the deal? What's the story? What is giving you hope? And if you've let go and moved on, please let me know how you did that. 

Logically I should be able to let go of mine easily, we broke up over a year ago, he's not even in the same state as me anymore, he did me kinda dirty, and I've even had an entire other relationship since then that ended a bit ago. He's still my person even if it doesn't make sense, I loved being around him.
