I’m happily married to my wife, and a great friend of ours (F), last year,  decided to finally kick her giant prick of a boyfriend out! I cannot stress enough of how much of a douche that guy was!! They have a 2-3 yo boy together and things are meeeessy!

Anyway, she’s not really hitting the dating scene as of now, mainly because she’s got the blues a lot.

I don’t have a very large arrays of bros to present to her. And here is my question: is it a good idea for me to ‘date’ dudes, and eventually present her with the top dog? 

Everything would have to be clearly explained to everybody involved, of course… and i feel like i have a great, ´good-guy radar’.

I'm currently working in Norway for a sort of cultural exchange in a small farm, hosted by a Norwegian family.
This girl is Austrian and we arrived here pretty much during the same period and, even tho i've met maaany other people during this experience, i just can't get her off my mind. We have so much fun together, i make her laugh a lot and she does too, i feel very comfortable with her and we really understand each other a lot. I've started to feel this very strong connection after getting to know her better and i know it may sound stupid but i really, really didn't want this. After some bad things that happened to me, i just wanted to focus on my life and that's why i'm doing this experience. But it happened, and now i'm struggling a lot with this.

One month ago, she left this place to go work somewhere else  for a couple of weeks and we were talking a lot on the phone via messages, and after awhile for me it was ok just like that.

But now, a couple of days ago she came back here and she's going to stay here up until next Monday, then she's going to go back to Austria for good.
I wasn't 100% sure of what i was feeling, but now, after a couple of days together after she came back, i feel like i REALLY, REALLY like her, and i just like so much being with her, making her laugh, working with her and everything else.

The only problem is that she's a very ""direct"" person and not very open about her feelings or emotions in general (i hope i explained well what i mean) and it's SO DAMN hard to tell what she's thinking or how she feels, i've never struggled so much with anyone before.

I really don't know what to do and also i only have a couple of days left since her departure, i just really need some advice.

Thanks in advance for reading my story and sorry for the length of the post.

His work schedule had been pretty busy so we hadn't been able to see each other that often and I had suggested hanging out at one of our houses so it could be more relaxed. We had only had dinner dates and I felt like I wasn't getting a chance to get to know him.

But then I started overthinking, we've only gone as far as a kiss and I got myself really nervous. Due to a new medicine, I've gained weight and am not comfortable with
my body right now in anyway. The thought of him coming over and things potentially leading somewhere more intimate freaked me out because I didn't want him to see my body. (I understand this is necessary for things to move forward but it's hard to rationalize with anxiety sometimes). So I cancelled on him blaming it on my anxiety and now I feel like I ruined a potentially good thing. He was understanding and said he wanted me to feel comfortable but when I brought up potentially rescheduling he hasn't replied since. 

Has anyone ever dealt with this? How did you overcome it? I'm mad at myself for just not going through with the date but I just couldn't do it.

In them I explained what happened when I met him  and our current situation.

Which I will be seeing him this Sunday for the first time after two months of being ghosted.
Long story shot he called me on Monday and explained and apologized for the way that it happened. He said he was a jerk for leaving without a word and that there was a lot going on with his life at that time (school and work) he’s (22M) and I am (20F) 

The thing is, leading up to the ghosting previously- he had always sucked at texting. I am not the type to really care as I am also a bad texter and have a busy life. So I more than anyone can understand when life gets in the way. Hell I don’t even need that constant mindless back in forth all day every day. I understand that he has a life and he’s busy just as I am. And I couldn’t be happier that he has his own goals and aspirations that he’s working towards.

But then it would kind of stay getting ridiculous at least personally when he wouldn’t reach out for 2-3 days then hit me up and ask to go on a date. 
How could I be his everything in person. And also be absolutely no one as soon as I’m out of sight??? 

Then the night before I got ghosted when I brought up my concerns and communicated with him, he himself acknowledged that it washes lack of texting and communicating. I had told him that I understood he had a life and was busy so if he needed spaces to figure out what he wanted I would give it. I said that if he wanted to date other people to figure it out I would understand. He said there was nothing that would scare him away and blah blah blah. Ghosting happened and now he’s back 2 months later. 

My current concern after having come down from cloud 9 of him reaching out, is that he’s more or less the same with communication. Since Monday he has texted me twice and proceeds to take full days to reply. In my head I’m thinking “you’d think you’d try a little more this time around, especially with how apologetic he was and how much he said he missed me and couldn’t stop thinking about me”

I really really do like this guy, if I’m honest he’s my ideal partner. It just he confuses me when he does that. I’m I expecting to much? And if I’m not how do I have a healthy discussion about my expectations from him this time around? Because I don’t want to feel like his all maybe twist a week and then feel forgotten for the rest of it. Also how do we discuss him leaving those two months? He was very vague on the phone call and I didn’t quite understand his reasons. 
I do, I want to work on this with him but I don’t want to scared him alway. He had told me that his last relationship of six months moved too fast that his ex was already talking about marriage and that he is being more careful this time around when it comes to getting into a relationship.

We had sexual interactions like oral and stuff but no actual sex. Part of it was our inexperience and her having some troubles opening up sexually to me. That led to some sexual frustration and low sexual confidence despite having a good attitude towards sex and a high libido. Fast forward to today, i have a semi high body count, especially since i only lost my virginity 2 and 1/2 years ago. And while i had high sexual confidence at times, i was never able to actually do it with frequency, and with someone that helped me and gave me the confidence and experience to be casually good at sex. Most of the girls ive been with was a one night stand, and the ones i had sex more then once i eventually lost interest or vice versa. So lets get to the actual problem. There’s this girl ive been talking to for the past year or so. Since the first month of talking we always had a rly high sexual chemistry, she had a boyfriend, we couldn’t meet but it was obvious that we wanted to fuck the shit out of each other. She broke up with him , and since she was from a bit far away we couldnt get Together that easily. The sexual tension was immense, exchanging nudes almost every day, “virtual sex” , and all kinds of things, i had days in wich i spent like 3h masturbating and trading nudes because i just couldn’t get enough of it. And it never got old, this went on for 2/3 months. Until we eventually went on a “date” for the first time, the sexual tension, the antecipation, the hopes for the best sex of our lives was off the roof. She had told me sometimes before that she had the fear of not being up to my standards and i always stated that that wasnt a problem, i wasnt going to leave her even if it wasn’t good because i actually liked her, and expected the same off of her. She had never came with sex, even masturbation, she was only ever to cum with vibrators or on the shower, and there were high hopes that i could make her cum. The sex wasn’t that good, i was completly stoned , was able to actually last a lot of time but she didnt cum and the sex itself wasnt amazing. With most of the girls i was with before her, that would be more than enough, and i know that for a fact, but not with her. She had a long relationship and lost her virginity way younger than me, she Didnt have as many bodies but had much more experience in actually having sex. But since she knew i had a lot of bodies, she thought i would be a sex machine, wich i am not (yet)(despite me telling her that i wasn’t). Since then we never had sex again, hooked up 2 more times but never actually had sex again, and both of those times she regretted us hooking up again because “it doesnt feel right”. The thing is, and i know this may sound really bad, im way over her league, i have plenty of girls inviting me to come over but i just cant do it. Its like that Kobe Bryant quote “Jobs not finished”. I still think that the job is not finished with her. Last tuesday on a night out some girl i hooked up randomly with asked for my number and was texting me all night to come over, and she was hot, really hot, all my friends were calling me dumb for not caring but i just didnt feel like it. My sexual confidence has come down to absolute crap, i do everything well, and if she just wants to give me a bj in the back of some shady spot and some finger play im totally chill about it , but when it comes to coming over and having sex, im worried to disappoint. Im actually more prone to have random sex in the middle of nowhere than coming over to a girls house because somehow the standards are a lot lower and i can actually not stress as much. Last time i actually came over to a girls house was 1 month ago, i was drunk and high , and i had to think about that one girl to get hard, and eventually (while hard) just lost interest and left. I just lost that sexually confident self i was before. The girl i like (the jobs not finished one) , is 19 (so 4 years younger) , wich even makes it harder to think that i couldnt make her stick around. We get together , meet sometimes and talk all day over text , she really likes me , and she tells me that im hot and that she would really fuck me but that it just “doesn’t” work. She even admits that im out of her league and that she doesnt understand why i stick around when i have no problem just moving to another girl. The thing is, shes sexually active , and the guys she fucks, even her friends Tell her they are way worse that me, but she still fucks them over me. Its like i had this girl i liked, and Part of it was our sexual connection and the way we just got along and wanted to fuck 24/7 and couldn’t, and now i don’t have that Part anymore, the physical side of our relationship has basically vanished. And that trips me out because i miss that , never been hornier in my life than when we had that.

While this mentality has brought me a lot of casual hook ups since i literally dont give a fuck about any other girl other than her, and that obsviously is attractive to a lot of girls, im stuck being a “bad boy” to most girls and then turning into an absolute puppy around her. 

For me, the job is just not finished.

And yeah, i do like her aswell, like romantically, but i know that is even more complex than actually having sex with her.

Tldr: girls want to fuck me but i dont, i just want that one girl. that girl has made my sexual confidence go to an all time low because she stopped wanting me sexually after the first time we had sex.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1134951,public,self,im a walking paradox (story time) 23M,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rdfmi5/im_a_walking_paradox_story_time_23m/,no_ads,0.0,

It's the closest thing I've had to a long term relationship, and she knows as such. When we met, I told her that I was in a place after dating of looking to focus on myself and figure out my anxieties and insecurities before pursuing a meaningful relationship. She said she was in a similar place and we can just take things slow without talking about our future. 

She's posted a few pictures of us together on her social media and I haven't said anything about it, but it triggers this really intense anxiety that I think is definitely a me problem. I'd like to do the healthy thing here and talk to her about it but she isn't doing anything weird, wrong or harmful - it's strictly my own insecurities and anxiety that are wrapped around it. 

I think I need time when seeing someone before posting 'us' on instagram and social media. In fact, I've re-evaluated my experience with social media and my best use of instagram is when I just use it to curate things for myself that I like about myself (travels/explorations/etc) outside of other people. I think the anxiety stems from if/when things go wrong, and having it all public. There is also this weird fear I have of people knowing about/talking about my romantic life? 

Just wondering if anyone has experienced something similar - if they prefer privacy while dating someone and still figuring out how you are together. It's not like she's posting ""glad I found you &lt;3"" type pictures - they're honestly harmless pictures that I'd post with platonic girl friends I wasn't sleeping with :S

May add was the worst jerk hand job I have ever got.

2nd worst date was with a girl I met off tinder, I am from the UK, her from Venezuela. She had just moved recently but claimed to speak good English, she was very attractive and was into me so we met up, awkward thing was she couldn't speak a fucking word of English, so I had to try to talk to a girl who I couldn't really talk to. I had to get a friend to text me ""Yo Jacks girl just went into labour get your ass to the hospital"" also may add she could read good English. I felt bad but same time it was uncomfortable as fuck.

Ever since my first and last ""high school"" date. I didn't come concerned about love or romance or dating. But it only resulted me to be alone and not actually going out there and finding new poeple.

This has been going on for years on and ever since last year, I've been online dating with apps and paying from time to time for girls to see me. It doesn't work, only a miracle would be possible even then it's highly likely it would be a mistake to swipe for me.

I'm known for being kind, big and have a weirdo type of  personality. And I just don't think women online or properly in person won't accept. They probably want a ""real man"" to be with them forever and have children. I on the other hand don't want to be married or have children. And I think that alone has cut majority of potential dates away only because I made a choice in my own right. I'm not saying this to target anyone. But I just feel like love is only getting in the way of life. It's like James Bond, you can get close but not top close. I can't even make a proper introduction. I'm known to be shy. And girls around me all seem to be 3 things. Taken. Uninterested or just plain cruel in teasing you and wanting you to burn.

I will be honest and say I missed being with someone you love, but at the same time it doesn't go right. But right now it's mostly because I'm online and not in person
but I'm afraid I won't be lucky, the world is cruel and I have accepted that.

The third time she mentioned him was on the first date. She just said something like “he took me to a G-League basketball game and it was the best date I ever been on. What was yours?” So I just answered it honesty and suggested maybe she needs to experience an NBA game (we live in a city with a team).

The fourth time she mentioned him I straight up asked her “When did you guys break up, are you not over this guy or something?” And she said she’s completely over him and she still talks to him “out of respect”.

I'm a 26 year old female. I was a late bloomer, and didn't really start dating until around 24; lost my virginity to my first boyfriend at 25. So overall, I'm relatively naive to a lot of the world of dating, but I think I've handled myself pretty well--I'm generally good at spotting problematic behaviors, and don't accept poor treatment from men I've been on dates with. I've got my life together pretty well (good job, own house, a variety of hobbies, volunteer), and am pretty self-assured and confident. Generally, I've had pretty good luck dating in general, and have had above average luck with online dating. Essentially, I feel like my ""picker"" is pretty decent, and I've had flings with some genuinely great guys and a defined relationship with another great guy. 

A pattern has emerged that has me really confused, and I'm wondering if I could get some insight into it. So far, I've been very into two guys. 

The first was a situationship, where we hung out weekly for about 4 months. He initiated things, and came on very strong at first. I was getting close to saying I love you, he told me he thought I was the one... and then when I asked about exclusivity, he said he just ""wasn't ready for a relationship."" I ended things after that, not willing to be anybody's second choice and essentially feeling like I'd been love bombed and actions weren't aligning with words. Of course, at the time, I held onto hope that he'd change his mind about things when I was no longer around. As is standard, after I ended it, there was no contact. Until about 1.5 months later, when he started texting me again and checking in. I was annoyed, but was pretty much over him, so agreed to be on friendly terms. And that's essentially what is was--friendly texting. He'd encounter my new online profiles, and say things like ""those pictures don't do you justice"" or would tell me how the guys online aren't deserving of me. Lots of ""you're too good everyone"" and ""it's like casting pearls before swine"". I didn't find this particularly hurtful, as I had an easier time getting over him--I'd found a lot of his behavior manipulative and pretty quickly moved to a place where I'd say no if he asked for a relationship. He never did. We haven't seen each other in person for nearly a year, but still he texts every couple of weeks or so. I don't mind it, but it feels weird. 

I thought Guy #1's behavior was a one-off until Guy #2 came around. Like guy #1, we met online. He initiated things for a long time. He said ""I love you"" first, agreed to being exclusive. He did lots of things that made me feel like he was serious about us--we went on lots of weekend trips, he insisted on paying for things, we spent a *lot* of time together. We were together for about 6 months. He moved a couple states away this summer, which ended it. Leading up to the move, I'd initiated a few conversations about how things would go, and he kind of brushed them off, planning to do long distance and telling me that things would ""work themselves out"". Then, of course, he moves, starts getting really distant, and isn't reciprocating my efforts. He then dumps me over text one night. Not unexpected given his behavior immediately before that, but it still hurt. He was my first real boyfriend, and the first person I fell in love with. He'd had a few LTR's before this. In his breakup text, he even told me he loved me, but that distance just wasn't going to work. It hurt, but I understood--he'd just finished grad school, and was starting his real ""adult"" life. I probably would've done the same when I moved after college--sometimes you just need a blank slate. IMMEDIATELY after the breakup, he continued to text me like normal--sending memes and tiktoks like we did before. I told him I needed space, and that it made me feel like he didn't care about what happened between us that he seemed to be moving on so casually. He said he understood, but that he was continuing communication to make sure I was ok because he felt horrible about hurting me and ending things and that he also wasn't over it. He gave me space when I asked for it, until I reached out with a note a month or so later letting him know that I was feeling better and that I hope his life in his new state was going well, knowing that he was probably lonely as he didn't know anybody there and doesn't have many friends. He responded kindly, and I kind of thought that would be it. However, much like guy #1, he continues to text me every couple weeks/month or so. Also like the first guy, he's very complimentary of me and even as he was dumping me, told me how great he thought I was and all that nonsense. Unlike guy #1, I never found him to be manipulative or love-bomb-y or anything. I genuinely believe he's just a good dude. 

It's not so much that I want either of these men back at this point, but I just find this pattern of exes telling me how great I am and then wanting to keep me around in a friendly capacity so strange and painful. My friends all seem to think it's bizarre too. And it almost hurts me *more* than just a regular breakup or rejection would. These guys both know me pretty well, have a continued interest in getting to know me and stay in touch, but despite knowing me, they *still* don't want to date me. Like they say I'm a great person and they're attracted to me and all these things, but apparently I'm just not great enough to date long-term or commit to. It just feels like a really deep-seated, personal rejection, you know? It makes me scared to fall for someone again because I'm worried the pattern will continue--a few months of happiness, followed by rejection and then bread-crumbing.

We met in class about 1.5 months ago. 

The very first time we hung out, we played lacrosse together. This is because he found out I was on the club team, and he apparently really enjoys playing, so he asked to join me sometime. After that, he asked me to come pick up food with him once. Then, I reciprocated by inviting him to my place for dinner after class. He also started offering to drive me home (I was just walking to campus before). I invited to my place for dinner a second time, and I also asked him then if he wanted to come to my club's formal. He said yes. The night of the dance, we drank and had a great time. We made out during the night, and eventually got back to my room. In my room, we ended up snuggling and talking until 5am or so. The next morning we woke up, and he pulled me in really close. We started making out, and after a few minutes he said ""I'm exhausted. We'll do this later."" We then went back to snuggling, sleeping, and talking for a few more hours. That was this past weekend.

This week, after class he asked me to come play lacrosse with him. Okay cool! We played and...that was that. Nothing romantic or affectionate really. Just playing and hanging out. Then after our last class today, I asked him if he wanted to keep hanging out now that our class together is over (we'd only ever hang out after class besides the dance), and he said yes...let's play lacrosse together weekend.

WTF? After this weekend, I really thought he liked me, even though we didn't have sex. We snuggled and talked for so long. He also made a joke on the night of our dance about being ""my first man"" if I become president (long story, inside joke). He also told me he opened up to me faster than he usually does with people. I guess he said those things while drinking so maybe they aren't true...but really? Am I just a lacrosse buddy now or something? Or is this just his way of spending time together?

I was 28 and she was 25 at the time. Eventually, friends, family and even her mom encouraged me to move forward and date someone new. I decided to seek therapy before making any moves.

Fast forward to this past summer...

I used to sell phones inside a Walmart store as an associate of OSL Retail Services and there was a cute young lady there. I developed a crush, but was crushed myself when I learned she had a boyfriend. Then, I learned that she is eight years younger than me, which made it feel even more inappropriate.

This past summer, she sent me a Facebook message that said she knew I often say hi to her when I visit that Walmart but I wouldn't find her there anymore because she got a new job after working there 4.5 years.

 I visited her before she quit and she revealed she was single (I remember thinking her 300-lb. ex was a lucky bastard because she was really nice and to add, beautiful). I also remember saying to myself, ""Damn. How did he get a girl like that? I must learn his techniques.""

I was then encouraged by many people to ask her out, so I did, eventually. The woman, however, is 23 and I'm now 31.

As for the lady that I will forever mourn, my new lady friend understands that there are certain anniversaries that are difficult for me (such as tomorrow, when my former SO would have turned 30).

He called me babe earlier too when we only had been talking for a couple days. We aren’t talking anymore because he apologized after asking if he could send me dick pics.

Am I weird? I feel like I’m not really into sexual things so early on especially if we haven’t went on a date or saw each other in public.

People always get surprised when I state my dating preferences to them. They are: female, 6 foot and above and left-handed. I myself am 6""4'-6""-5' and also left handed. How unusual are such criteria? 

I would like to clarify that it is not a sexual attraction to those attributes but purely practical. As left handed people will attest it is quite frustrating living in a right handed persons world. Currently I live with three roommates – all left handed – and have found it much more comfortable and enjoyable than previous arrangements.  Height follows a similar logic. I am simply more comfortable around taller people – all my siblings are above 6"" – and enjoy not having to look down at people constantly. – I have serious neck issues (not visibly noticeable). 

That being said, as a friend pointed out after I turned down a dating opportunity to an attractive, pleasant, individual, that demographic represents roughly .8% of the population. So it is unlikely I will find a compatible person matching those criteria. Should I open myself up to other opportunities? Or should I just keep going with my current route. I am not desperate for a relationship, and, am still in University, but I do feel unusual explaining my logic to people.

Every time I go out, someone (usually married women, for whatever reason) always asks why I’m alone. The most recent example was: “I could never handle the anxiety of going out alone. Do you not have any friends?”

I try to just laugh it off, because I’m sure they mean no harm, but then I sit there thinking “Wow, I must look so lame/weird” when honestly, me taking myself out is currently the only way to get social interaction because my friends are just busy this time of year.

I accidentally sent him a kiss emoji instead of a normal smiley face one and he did send a kiss back, but that was it. 

Part of me is worried he is secretly married and not wanting to leave much written evidence. He's obviously not shy about being forwards after all. 

I am just confused. What other reason might someone be demonstrative irl but not over text? He says on his online profile that he fancies a bit of sex (not in those exact words). But he also says he wants his next relationship to last several years. I know the two can be true at the same time. I'm happy to have perhaps ill advised sex til I find the next guy to have a relationship with.

For the past few years I have had a huge lack of self confidence which I've no doubt has had an impact on my dating life, I'm not sure when this or how this started but I can't remember not feeling the way I do. 

My dating life has not been at all successful, I have been stood up a number of times which really took its toll. I have gotten myself into good shape and athletic hoping for better outcomes but again nothing, I have tried  asking the questions /asking for advice from friends which should garner some sort of response. But again I get nothing. So, over the course of time I just became less and less confident in my own self worth. 

However in the past few months I have tried to put that behind me and like myself more, get out there more and put myself out on the likes of tinder, bumble, hinge etc. I have been going to the gym to get myself into decent shape and recognising the things I am good at and I can be proud of. However, in my efforts I have found very little success. And to be blunt I've found this incredible demolarilsing. 

I have a brother who is an incredibly good looking guy (6ft+, good personality, good physique) and he has tried to be a real help to me these past few months saying ""just get out there"" and stuff like that, and to try and make me feel good about myself. However I am realistic to know that I can't compare to him physically. And 90% of these apps just go off looks and nothing else. 

And since I have not had any likes on the apps mentioned above I have to wonder what is the point of all the effort I am putting in to get nothing in return. If I do get a like/match on a dating app I always feel like I'm putting in 100% effort compared to them, and at that point I just stop because why should I expend effort for someone who clearly doesn't care. 

I'm getting to the point of whether I just stop the whole use of these apps and hope for something for the future as at the moment I feel this path is doing more bad for my mental health than it is good.
