I asked him out, but he followed up and planned the date. He was the more talkative person, the body language was good and there was a lot of laughter. He offered to drive me home afterwards.

I asked him if he tried a fast food place that he had mentioned, and I told him that I can come along because I’ve been wanting to try it too. He said ‘Next Friday would be good.’ but then remembered that he’s going on a weekend vacation.

We said our thank you’s right before I left. We hugged goodbye (I regret not going for a kiss, but that’s another story).

When I got back home, I sent him a song he asked me to send. He said ‘Thank you! I’ll listen to it in a bit’. A day later, I replied telling him to tell me what he thinks later. That day, he sent me a meme video on instagram (some pun about my name) and I replied with a sarcastic joke and that was it. 

I don’t know if I should text again or not, if he’s really interested or not, if he’s busy (senior med student) or if it’s just the shyness taking over. I feel like he should be the one to initiate the second date since I’m the one that brought it up when we were together.

Up until a couple months ago she was dating a mutual friend of ours which had been going on for almost a year.

When I first met her it was through our mutual friend and they were already dating. They were friends for years but only started dating in the last year. Initially, I had no feelings for her and simply enjoyed her company and being friends with both of them. All of us hung out on a regular basis. Over time I started to witness how emotionally abuse and manipulative her partner was and how toxic their relationship was.

Within the last 5 months my friendship with my female friend started to grow and get deeper. It wasn't until about 3 months ago that I realized I was starting to develop feelings for her beyond friendship. I ignored it at first as she was still dating my other friend and I didn't want that to get in the way of all of our friendships. However, about two months ago her and her ex finally broke up. I remember being both relieved as a friend because of witnessing how toxic their relationship was, and also a bit excited because I thought I may finally have a chance with her as my feelings for her had grown even stronger. Due to how my male friend had treated her, and also some other conflict we had had on our own, I made a tough decision and decided to cut him off as well.

For the past two months, we've been texting nearly every day, and we hang out at least once or twice a week, usually at her place. Yesterday when I was with her I told her I wanted to talk and decided to tell her how I feel. She said she loved me, but with everything that happened with her ex still fresh in her mind she isn't ready for another relationship right now, but then followed up with ""who knows, I may be open to one with you in the future."" When I asked her to clarify if this was just a subtle rejection she said she wasn't sugarcoating things and that this wasn't her rejecting me, but that she genuinely just didn't have a relationship on her mind right now, and wanted to focus on her friendships and being alone, as she hasn't really been single in over 6 years. She also said she didn't want to force anything, and that (in her mind), people that are best friends for a lengthy period of time are the ones that turn into the best relationships.

So I guess my question is...is it a wise decision for me to wait, continue being a great friend and always being there for her (as I do still value our friendship, even though I want more intimacy) or should I move on, focus on other woman, and still just take this as a no? (as her ""who knows"" could still go in either direction, and isn't really a definitive yes or no). What I know we do both share together right now is a strong emotional bond, and a mutual trust for each other. So I trust what she says. And I really do care for this girl. However, I also wonder if distancing myself for a little while would be a good idea just to squash/lessen some of these deeper feelings I have for her, or just set some boundaries, in case things don't pan out how I wish.

Any thoughts or advice? Thank you.

TL;DR: I have feelings for my best friend who just got out of a toxic relationship 2 months ago. I confessed, she told me she wasn't rejecting me, but wasn't ready for a relationship right now, yet may be open to one with me in the future.

I've never been in a relationship before so I didn't know what is considered ""normal"", this is the first time I've even gone on more than one date with someone: I started dating this girl that I met on a dating app. After about 3 months, at the end of the 3rd date (we'd gotten physical by that point), I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend and she said she liked me but she said ""let's just see where this goes"". I asked her that because I really like her and also at the end of the 2nd date she talked about how she got out of a 2.5 year relationship a couple of months ago and prefers long term, monogamous relationships over flings.

It's now been about 5 months total and we went on a 7th date on thursday night since she was in town (she lives about 45 mins away and drives over to come see me when we go out). The plan was to go on this date and then go to a sports game saturday night. At this date on thursday we had dinner and then went to a bar at her hotel where we had a couple of drinks.. so my honesty started coming out.

* At one point she asked what I specifically liked about her and we started talking about things we like about each other and she said she felt like I only wanted her for sex and that I never asked her personal questions. I said at this point she must have realized that I'm a pretty direct person who knows what he wants, so I said that no, I wanted more than that, I said I didn't even bring protection because I never ""expect"" to have sex with her. I said I wanted her to be ""mine"" and as a man that of course I didn't want to see her with other people. I said jokingly that I'm ""selfish"" like that and that instead of seeing other people she should see me. She said I should be seeing other people since we're not exclusive and I said that I was seeing someone next weekend and she said she was about to say ""I hope it goes well"" but then caught herself. Then we switched subjects.

**Nsfw warning (this might not even be relevant but I'm not sure so please skip if this is too personal):** After that we went up to her room where we had non-penetrative sex that was very enjoyable. She got pretty turned on and said she wanted to have unprotected sex because she was on birth control but since I've never done that before I said I didn't trust her enough to do that. **At one point she stopped me and told me she wanted to be fwb and we shook on it. I regret shaking on it because that's not what I want and instead wanted to say that no I'm not shaking on that but I did.** I left by kissing her and telling her I'd see her on saturday and she said yeah. When I got home I was buzzing with happiness.



The next morning I started realizing things. I realized how weird this all would come across if she doesn't feel the same way. It's a feeling like I would be ""trapping"" her in this relationship that she's not into as much as I am. It comes off as desperate and wish I wouldn't have said any of it and would have just played it cool. Saturday morning I get a text that says:

&gt; Hey for tonight's game I don't think I'll be available to go. Would love to come with next time!

So I messaged her back a few hours later once I thought it through:

&gt; Yea sounds good maybe another time

I feel like such an idiot. I know she cancelled because she also felt weirded out. I know for a fact that if I had just never asked her to be my girlfriend or said anything about committing that maybe she would have brought it up at one point. I took her from wanting a long-term, monogamous relationship into just wanting fwb to wanting basically nothing at all. So my plan now is to go no contact for about 3 weeks. I feel myself getting way too attached to this girl and I know she feels it too. I want to give her space even though it is difficult and then reach back out in 3 weeks time saying ""hey sorry things have been crazy lately, what's up?"" or something like that.

If you're average in looks, start wearing makeup. Korean male models wear it all the time and it takes their looks from a 7 to a 10. Before I started wearing makeup, my crush only saw me as average. But with a contour that adds shadows to my jawline and concealer that took away blemishes, she started calling me cute (in that way).

Start dressing better. In 2021, unless you're super hot, a pair of jeans and a t-shirt will not make you see in the dating world. Fashion attracts. And it attracted by crush quite while.

Start social media and put effort into it. Before I started putting effort into my social media, people who saw it would see me as ugly and unorganized. But when I started taking the advice of several social media influencers along with stealing their aesthetic, a bunch of people started following me (over time) and now my inbox is filled with random people trying to flirt with me. If you have a crush and they see your social media status, they'll be impressed with the results and want to get to know you more.

Now that's just the basics to get you to look better. Personality is what will take you to the finish line.

Personality advice:

Tease the hell out of them. For this I want you to look up from multiple sources on ""how to tease someone you like"" or a variation of that. Whoever shows will give you the advice you need. What teasing does is put the person you're talking to through a whirlwind of emotions. The more you tease, the more they'll want to talk to you because you're making them feel emotions. You're making them have a fun time when talking to you. Trust me, this works. A year ago I was talking to this girl who I was friendly with. Then after I learned how to tease, she was practically begging me to keep talking to me more. This works. Do it.

Keep your texts as short as possible. No one wants to read a text or 5 of them while trying to get to the point of what you're saying. Keep your texts short and send 2 of them at the bare minimum. If they don't text you after a while, don't send them a double text. If they don't text you back in a few days, call them. You may feel like ""oh I don't want to bother them"" but that's not what you're doing. You're making them say to themselves ""Oh, this is a person in my life who wants to get to know me. Maybe I should get to know their intentions more."" This level of interest is one of the fundamental moves that'll get someone to be interested in you. Show them interest, but not too much interest.

Ask questions. About literally anything. Make the person talk about themselves. The more they talk about themselves mixed with your teasing, it'll cause they to want to ask things about you.

Plus I'm kind of paranoid. I mean I'm a guy but I've never used online dating simply because I've heard horror stories about catfish.

Already theres this one girl I'm talking to who seems pretty cool. But I'm taking it all with a grain of salt.

I didnt say anythingabout it then and as far as i know that's no big deal to him. 

ok so i felt just kind of awkward the next morning. I knew maybe it was too fast. i left in the morning. He didnt even walk me to the door. shortly thereafter, he texted me saying he likes someone else.  well that would explain why he didnt walk me to thedoor i guess. 
yes i was hurt but also i felt like there was absolutely no ambiguity with what he was telling me so i didnt stick around. i understood him and left him alone. 

But for a few months after that he kept bothering me and wanting to be ""friends"" . RIiiiight. kept inviting me to things but also being very flirtatious with me and acted like nothing even happened between us.  i did my best to avoid him. I didnt know how to articulate it at the time but i felt weird about the removing the condom without my permission thing. i just didnt really undestand at the time why i felt weird about it. 
but during that time he was talking to all our mutual friends about me. telling them how he hurt my feelings and he even contacted a friend of mine because, according to him, he figured i would tell my friend what happened.  It was almost like he was gloating and he was amused. he was acting like i was being ridiculous and overdramatic by not taking him up on his ""friendship"" offer.  a respectful person wouldn't treat someone this way. it was actually upsetting. i felt like i was being bullied. I hadn't even talked about him and part of me was hoping he'd have been as discrete as I was (even though I didnt owe him that, i should have been the one talking crap).

One day i wrote him an email telling him my feelings. i told him how humilated i felt, how what he was doing is not how a ""friend"" would act. 

yeah dumb move but i avoided him even MORE after that email. I was just too embarrassed. I was hoping it would be between us even though i knew he was blabbing his big mouth to everybody.

anyways luckily things sort of died down and now it's three years later.  I ran into his roomate recently, who asked if i wanted to go out to lunch with him. I don't know how i feel about that. i am surprised the roommate remembered my name as I met him only one time. then i spent some time with a mutual friend and the mutual friend made it clear that Jon talked about me. 

I'm mortified. I could try to contact him to tell him to knock it off. but I feel like that would only add fuel to the fire. Why is Jon acting like this? he rejected me. I accepted that. then he bullied me. what did i ever do to him? why is he still talking aboiut me? I am prettysure he has a girlfriend. I mean i dont think he's doing it out of liking me... but i'm saying you'd think he'd move on with his life and be kind to me? because how come he doesn't realize what he did to me was very hurtful and mean? like if it were me, i dont talk about guys i've previously rejected. like because i move on with my life.

is there anything I can do? i was upset when i heard he was talking about me still and making fun of me.

Never had sex, kissed, etc; and I've never had a girl interested in me either. At this point in my life I don't know how or when I could ever get into a relationship. Meeting girls is hard, my school isn't particularly social so making new friends in general is just hard, and there are a decent bit more guys than girls at my school too. 

I'm too scared to try to approach any girls not because of rejection, but because I don't want them to be creeped out that some guy is trying to talk to them. I'm not physically intimidating or anything, I just worry that if I'm not a very attractive guy then my advances would make me seem like a creep. And since I haven't had any girls interested in me (to my knowledge) I just assume I'm unattractive. 

This also makes it hard to be friends with girls. Since I don't want them to think I like them, I tend to not be as friendly which means that I don't really end up becoming friends with them. There's really only one girl that I've met recently that I might actually become friends with (since she's more friendly) but I'm worried I'll end up having a full-blown crush on her (which I'm already a little bit interested in her anyways). To my credit, I have gotten better socializing in general but initiating conversations with people I don't know is paralyzing.

Now I'm stuck as to what I can do. I can't say I've given up on dating because something could always change, but at the same time given my lack of dating history I don't feel like I have any chances anymore. I don't know if I'm just too anxious to try saying anything and that's why I've never dated, or if I'm really as unattractive as I think and that's why nobody wants to be with me. I want to ask some friends about what I can do but I'm afraid of embarrassing myself by asking. I also don't really want to ask if I am unattractive or if I'm not and I have no idea.

So this might sound dumb or trivial but browse here often and I (28M) just thought I’d ask your opinions. My girlfriend (27F) and I have been living together for a very long time. Let’s say three years. I have a pet Australian Shepard and she has a pet border collie and we adore them. We both had our dogs before we got together and they’re both adults, so all the normal puppy business was past and they’re well into their personalities and behaviors. However, we have extremely different expectations for our dogs and definitely different training methods. Well in her case no training methods, horrible to be quite honest.  Fortunately for her, he is incredibly intelligent, obedient, just the sweetest damn dog. I’m honestly jealous of how easy it is to work with him. I worked with my dog every day for two years, he’s an aussie so he’s very stubborn. It took me honestly I don’t know how many hours of work to correct bad behaviors with him. And my work paid off, I could literally have this dog off leash anywhere without worrying about him making suddenly reacting to his environment as you expect dogs to. He was better than most peoples children in public. I was very proud of him, still am because this isn’t his fault. Over the last three years she has babied and negatively reenforced  my dog incredibly and he has picked up most every bad habit we got passed and them some, he’s very vocally loud, quick to his instincts and have nearly no control over his behavior even at home, definitely hard to have in public. I admit, since we’ve been together I have slacked off with working with him because of focusing on my relationship and putting her first so I know I am partially to blame, but I don’t think I’m out of line. It’s not like we haven’t been over this, it’s been discussed at length several times. She knows how much it bothers me and doesn’t even respect the simplest of techniques I’ve asked her use with him. In fact, when we split up a while back and decided to get back together, one of my conditions was to work on how she treats my dog and I believe she unwilling to accommodate at this point. I treat her dog with all the love I have in the same as I treat my dog. I’ve also worked with her dog along side mine and we’ve made such progress it’s amazing. I love this woman, I would walk through a burning building to pull her out of it if I had too. Does this mean our parenting styles would clash like this? Because if we can’t come together and compromise when we raise our children I have serious doubts about the future of our relationship. What do you guys think? Am I being ridiculous. 

I’d like to know that there are other things in our relationship that we are working on. I am aware of the minutia of the question. I do however strongly believe that it is valid. If we were to have children I would like for us to be great parents but we have to be willing to compromise with each other right?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162380,public,self,"Relationship and Pets, Any Advice?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t315m8/relationship_and_pets_any_advice/,no_ads,0.0,,,,

They responded by saying they would let me know if they’re available or not. But in the situation where they are not free they said they’re sure they will see me again.

Before we met, we stayed up all night talking through the phone like 8 hours. He said that he is looking for someone who is compatible for a relationship.  The first date was perfect, and he was really nice. 

At our first meeting, he paid all the costs. Of course I insisted but he rejected it . He invited me to a cafe, a movie theater and a nice dinner place. I jokingly asked if I look alike the profile and he said that he would have run outta place asap if I wasn't his type. While thrusting salad in my mouth in a restaurant, he started to become a little bit serious. He talked about his dream and said there is a possibility that I'm included in his future.  I thought it was just too fast and uncomfortable(maybe futre-faking)  so I asked the question to make things clear, ""Umm... so you wanna relationship with me?"" He plainly answered ""No""  I agreed with him.

After the dinner, he drove me to my house and we had some conversations.  ""So how was the date? Do you find us compatible?""  He hesitated a moment, and replied ""Actually, we don't click yet. Your personality is not my type."" I said ""Ok"" and took it as a rejection, and I agreed that we were not compatible. We hugged in front of my house and I gave a good bye air kiss. And he lastly said to me ""Wait, you know what? Men never invest to a woman he don't find attractive.  I said ""Thank you"" and he left.

After the date, I got a message from him.  I was surprised because I thought we were not supposed to meet anymore. This time, he invited me to his house. Although he didn't explicitly say what we are gonna do in his place, I could tell that he was anticipating sex. So I blocked him. and let him go and get any other girl. 

I thought that was the end. Four days have passed from the first date but he hit me every single day, at the exactly same time,(like 1:30, 2:00, 2:30...)  five times a day even though I never answered the phone. It was creepy af but I eventually accepted his phone call because he was also my type and I thought I couldn't do better than him. I honestly said that it seems like we want different things in this relationship and I'm not ready for sex yet.  He said ""So that was the reason you ghosted me? Hey, I'm not pushing you to do it and I never expected a sex. If you don't want it, we can talk about it. "" 

After the phone call, we made a plan for a second date. Not at his place but at the park near my home.  I kinda started to have feeling for him and I'm also afraid if he just want sex.

Yet he’s called me multiple times and has insisted that he wants a future with me. And apologies for his behavior. And goes on and on about how I’m the woman he dreams about and wants to come home to. And he ignored me because he was scared and hasn’t liked someone the way he likes me. 

Then the next day, goes back to ignoring me. 

Every time, he says he is going through some stuff but it’s “too dark” to talk about on the phone, then makes plans with me to tell me in person, then disappears. He talks about suicide and I’ve been trying to be really supportive and made sure he’d told his dr. And gave him the suicide hotline #

Then he texted me that his friends mom died and he had to go to the funeral, but we can do coffee earlier. Sure no prob and sorry to hear that. 

Saturday….nothing. Ignored my calls and texts. I was worried about him. Then he posted an instagram story of him at the bar with his friends. I lost it a bit and called him 6 times. 

I tried calling him today, nothing. Then I decided I’d had enough. I blocked him on social media and texted him we were done. Don’t know why he wasted his time saying he wanted a future with me if it was all lies. I hope he doesn’t treat anyone like this again. 

The other thing is, he’s not much of a catch. He has a beautiful personality which is what I loved. But that’s about all he has going for him. He doesn’t exactly have girls chasing him. 

My question is: why? Why would someone play these games? Make all the effort? To disappear for no reason? Why would someone be so “scared” they ignore the “woman of their dreams”

Part of me wonders if he is mentally ill and if I should try to let someone close to him know, because his behavior is so far from normal or sane.

I’ve met players who ghost, but a guy who makes these extreme statements, and then disappears completely? It is clear I will never get answers from him, but I’m more mystified than anything.

In fact, I used to give a lot of guys a chance on the off chance that I might feel differently on a date than I do online or in person. 

Not anymore. Now I barely swipe on anyone, on the few days when I’m not taking a break from online dating. 

Online dating isn’t easy for men or women, but as I’m a woman who’s not super attractive enough to be treated well by most men, this is *my perspective as a regular woman*. 

Why am I so picky now? 

I got really tired of wasting so much time and effort for the results I get. So now I really reduced how much I invest in it.

These results can be summed up as one or more of the following:

-Guys ignoring that I’m *only* looking for a relationship. 

This is made clear from them either right from the start, or after asking me out under false pretenses. Bc I make sure we’re both clear about what kind of interaction we’re both looking for in my profile and before committing to meet. 

No one owes me a relationship, but they do owe me honesty and not wasting my time if they’re not interested in a relationship at all, or not any possibility with me. And I do not owe anyone casual sex when I tell you that’s not what I’m looking for.

Whether I pay for myself, just get the tip, or you insist on paying for all of it.

-Guys mass swiping on every woman that might make the casual sex cut. 

All the swipes in the world make no difference if they go no where bc I’m just a backup not worth following up with. 

I could get 50 and if 50 never reply back, I might as well not have any. I stop bothering to swipe on most guys bc it’s a huge waste of time.

-Guys with women issues

Dude, if I’m on a first date with you, I don’t need you whining about how everything in your life is my fault bc I’m a woman or about every woman who you felt wronged you in life. Whether they did or not, it has fuck all to do with me. And your height is not my fault either.

I just met you and didn’t even have time to hypothetically screw up your life yet to make me put up with hearing about how everything is the fault of the entire women population. 

I also don’t need to hear about how I’m this or that bad thing bc I was born a woman, or not enough to be equal bc of whatever backwards and offensive ideas you might have. That doesn’t make me want to be around you. That makes me want to get far, far away from you.

Or how I don’t get to choose someone I’m attracted to and like bc I’m a woman, but you can bc you’re a guy. News flash, we all tend to pick people we’re attracted to for a non-platonic situation.

Or how I want you putting your hands all over me and invading my personal space, acting aggressive, or insulting and rude towards me bc I apparently like that bc I’m a woman. You negging me is immature and annoying. It shows me you don’t know how to behave normally in social situations.

I don’t like this shit, and that’ll be the first and the last date despite what you might think otherwise bc you’re an “alpha”. (Weird way to refer to yourself, btw.)

I am not perfect. Far from it, bc I’m human. But I am very picky now and the few dates I do go on anymore, I almost always get asked on a second one so I’m at least tolerable. 

But the whole online dating experience has made me cynical and mostly turned off to trying. 

I am not alone in this. Women get tired of this stuff. This kind of shit I summarized makes fewer women swipe right on men. So when I hear about how picky women are, maybe it’s time to start to ask why that might be. 

Not all men do these things and it really sucks that the pool has been pissed in for you too, unfortunately.

It's really weird. It's the first time that I cannot find a connection. I also asked her a lot of things ofc.

She seems a really good girl, but seems a bit... summisive? I mean, she doesn't seem to be extremely confident, but when I suggest something she seems more confident and open to do things.

But as I told you before she asks a lot of questions and make jokes. The last thing I got is that she's terrible at cooking. So I suggest cooking together one day. I think she liked the idea. Lol.
