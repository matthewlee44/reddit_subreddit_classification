My biggest questions: 

1. Is it possible too ask for once future gf too take it slow because i feel very uncomfortable when it comes too intimacy? Or am i being way too scared?

2. How do you make it clear, that i be the one person that is not the dtf but more of a ""i wanna get married and only love you for the rest of my life"" person?

3. Everytime i like someone my subconscious defens mechanism kicks in and i just push that girl away (really sucks) Anybody with similar tips and trick on how too stop this?

Showed up to a house party a bit late last night and did my go rounds of saying hey to all the people I knew.

I sat down and started to eat when a girl, who was talking to a friend of mine, came over and tried to feed me my food (weird‚Ä¶. I know. She was drunk). 

I pulled away and went somewhere else. Once I finished, I went to clean the dishes when she came into the kitchen and started caressing me and trying to make out.

I recently moved near where I went to college and there are quite a few people that I know that still live here. I (25M) have gone on some dates with a few different girls while I was in school and most of them are still single. If I was rejected or did the rejecting on the dates I went on with them, would it be appropriate to interact or go on a date with any of them at this point? It's been 2+ years since I've really interacted with any of them seriously (other than the occasional instagram DM or facebook comment) and wasn't sure if this would come off as a creep move. I'm not trying to come off as a creep (have heard this from one of my friends - although the guy asked her out again a month after she rejected him and wouldn't leave her alone). I know a lot has changed in the 2+ years that have passed for me (matured a ton, starting medical school next fall, etc.). I'm sure they've changed considerably as well.

17,q0q1gr,1633292886,(M) Is it even realistic to look for FWBs while not being conventionally attractive ?,"So I'm a dude whose search consists basically in ""friends, sex, or even better : both"". After figuring out I'm aromantic and knowing that living alone and single is the pinnacle of personal satisfaction for me, I came to the conclusion that the optimal course of action for me is to look for FWBs. I am often told I have great charisma and decent charm in real life, but this translates HORRIBLY on Tinder.

First of all, I'm noticeably overweight. I know what you're gonna say and yes, don't worry, it's a serious WIP. Good progress has already been made but it's still a looong way to my weight and gym goals. Some realistic projections I've made indicate that I have around a solid year or so of work in order to start looking good. Second, my pictures are shit. Like really garbage. No one I know, including me, takes good pictures (or any pictures, for that matter) so I had to resort to using the best selfies in my capacity, but honestly I don't look good in any of them and trust me, I tried.

It appears to me than to stand a chance in finding FWBs, I have to look great on my profile. Of course, I meant it when I said that just finding friends is fine and I won't push further if I don't have a chance, but people won't magically start to swipe right if I say that on my profile either.

TL;DR : I'm working on it, but in the meantime I have no shot at looking attractive on my profile. Should I just wait until I am better suited for Tinder ?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0q1gr/m_is_it_even_realistic_to_look_for_fwbs_while_not/

19,q0q5ss,1633293242,"Don‚Äôt hang around for the potential of how good life could be together, if you‚Äôre unhappy now you‚Äôll be unhappy later‚Ä¶","As the title suggests, my (f25) ex partner (m32) and I separated a few months ago, the relationship itself was tumultuous and painful to say the least.

We had been friends for over 4 years and met at the gym, we had a lot of mutual interests and shared the same outlook on where we wanted to be in life as far as marriage, family and children etc‚Ä¶

He is from another country and has different religious views that made things tricky sometimes, things that at first didn‚Äôt bother him about me grew to be the things he hates the most. I recognised the pattern and attempted to leave a few times but he would always try to draw me back in with the promise of potential.

He &amp; his family are incredibly wealthy, something that I admit initially made me even more excited about our future because I did not come from money. I am finally in a place where I have all the things I‚Äôve ever wanted and everything I have for myself now has come from me working, really, really hard. He promised to double it and would go on about how much more I could have which began to warp my perception of what I was already fortunate enough to have.

I was promised whichever house I wanted, my dream car and a literal crown from the MIL should I give her a grandchild (specifically a son). After one particularly bad fight which went on for hours of him berating me to the point I secretly voice recorded his words for my own safety, I decided this was the final straw. We ended, not amicably and didn‚Äôt speak for a few months.

Fast forward to now, he called me a few days ago to say he was going to be dropping something off and that he wanted to talk. I felt like enough time had subsided that we could do so without tension. I was still in contact with his Mother up until this morning.

We spoke, he told me he thinks we could do it and succeed in a good long relationship if we work hard and recognise our flaws. He showed some introspection about things he did wrong and why he feels he acted the way he did. He began talking about all the things we could have if we just made it work, he said in his heart it is only me and that he can‚Äôt focus on anything without me by his side.

I thought about it real hard and told him how I felt, honestly and without any self serving agenda. I told him realised over our separation that I was in love with the potential of what we could have rather than the present moment of what we had. He agreed and said this might‚Äôve been what he was doing too but he loved me as a person, I admitted in all honesty that despite the fact that I truly loved him, I didn‚Äôt actually know why. 

We weren‚Äôt compatible the longer we stayed together so many things came to light that changed my perception of him and the type of person he is. Part of me was just waiting for the day that things got better and all of a sudden our relationship was easy because we had X, Y or Z.

I told him that waiting for me to be ready was denying him of finally grieving and moving on to potentially find someone who is perfect for him. He cried but agreed and said he will ask God to protect me and that he prays I will be with someone one day who can love me without making me cry. We hugged and he left, I thought I was fine until I got back inside and I just balled my eyes out, funny because I‚Äôd already accepted the relationship as being over and had no intention ever being with him again, but this time it really felt like whatever was still keeping us stuck was lifted and we both had closure to finally move forward.

I can‚Äôt remember why I started writing this or even if it still makes sense with the title, I think I just wanted to get it out. 

TLDR: don‚Äôt hang around in a relationship for what you could have in the future if your present is wounding you, you only hold yourself &amp; the other person back from finding their person.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0q5ss/dont_hang_around_for_the_potential_of_how_good/

21,q0qfd8,1633294069,Mixed signals but lots of flirting?,"**weirdest case of mixed signals:**

I (21 Nonbinary) am in my senior year of college and have recently struck up a new friendship with a sophomore (19 Nonbinary). They‚Äôre incredibly friendly, cute, outgoing, friendly with many in my year and seemingly non-avoidant when it comes to intimacy with those they fancy. I immediately had an interest/crush on them when we first met and we had 100% been flirting (as perceived by friends as well) also lots of light touches/touching each other, eye contact and being overly friendly. 

They made a comment to our mutual friends about having ‚Äúaccidentally been flirting with me and not sure how to feel about such.‚Äù I let a week go by before texting them to clear the air and letting them know I have been flirting / wanting to get to know them better but was anticipating straight up rejection. At this point it seemed like that had been texting a bit less (and it didn‚Äôt seem like the REALLY wanted to follow through) but they are taking an extremely difficult class who I‚Äôve had the professor for and have been very stressed with such and gender identity.

Their text back was interesting ‚Äî they told me that they ‚Äúdo feel more like a friend vibe than romantic ig but honestly more like soul siblings??‚Äù Soul siblings‚Ä¶. and ‚Äúig‚Äù what kind of friend zoning is this?And that they‚Äôve felt very connected to me and have wanted to get to know me more and spend more time with me?? I began putting aside any of my feelings I had bc this felt / seemed like a ‚Äúnot interested.‚Äù

However the next time we saw each other in person they immediately came over and asked for me to feel their hands (specifically me) / held my hand / were very touchy with me and gave me a lingering hug (all of which my friends confirmed to seem like flirtatious behavior, especially because they instigated the touching which felt weird bc I had said I liked them)

However later I saw them being a bit touchy/in close with a guy/ a friend who they were kinda swinging hands with and so maybe this is just the way they are with others? Later we ended up bumping into each other when they were with the guy from before and them seemed to be in an odd space (they had also had a bad drunk sexual encounter the night before to be fair). The guy and I ended up chatting while they stayed relatively reserved in the conversation (I wasn‚Äôt sure if they were bothered by me being there)? We all broke off from each other and said we might hang later.

I FaceTimed them later in the evening to see what they were up to and they (were shirtless lol) said ‚ÄúI have these two plans but maybe we can hang later later tonight‚Äù but I knew it was kinda just them saying that bc they seemed to be rushing me off the phone.

The next day I asked them to hangout / walk the dog and have been met with radio silence. Did I do something to bother them/make them uncomfortable, are they playing games (or am I?) and should I stop reading into the vibe / tension I feel / the touching and just move on. We're still getting to know each other but at this point I'm like am I driving you away?

At the end, she asked if she could come hit the gym with me next weekend (ie spend more time together). She also offered to pay for my milkshake which I declined lol.

We haven't messaged each other 2 days since then and I'm wondering if that's normal. 

I'm used to moving very fast with most girls. Usually because we have sex on the first date and then make it official very soon after.

As I said, I came to terms with the idea that I‚Äôll spend my life alone. And tbh it‚Äôs not actually that bad. I can develop myself in multiple ways and live the way that is suitable to me without worrying it might not be something that would sync with my partner‚Äôs lifestyle or with the family we‚Äôd create further on.

Yes I agree, the biggest drawback will be not having a family on my own - not having a loving husband nor children‚Ä¶ Those are the dreams I wished came true one day.

Maybe but only maybe some day I will come across someone that will change my mind again. But tbh - I doubt. And yeah Ik I‚Äôm still young but some things you just know.

No, I‚Äôm not planning on having a loose life now - actually it‚Äôs the opposite. I just want to focus on simply improving myself internally and outwardly.

30,q0rgp6,1633297223,This one girl I was seeing was hiding her fupa and gut to make herself look less fat? Is this a common thing?,"So I met this chick a little over a 2 and a half ago and we‚Äôve been seeing each other semi regularly. From what I saw she wasn‚Äôt fat. She wasn‚Äôt super skinny either but I don‚Äôt really like girls that are skinny. If anything I like girls that are in shape or muscular in a way most guys dislike. 

So we were dating and recently was the first time I had seen her naked. So she took off her top and there‚Äôs tape going from her lower gut to upper stomach sides. She takes the tape off and her gut falls down.

I just say what the fuck. She looks at me crazy. So it turns out she had slightly bigger arms and bigger legs (which I thought was muscle) and the just a super fat gut that she had been hiding. It made me not want to have sex with her and I felt like I was catfished.

Now I‚Äôll fully admit I‚Äôm not some Greek god in terms of physique(not yet at least) but I have a flat toned stomach and she made it look like she did too. When I told her I felt like she was trying to trick me because she said she worked out a lot, she told me she told me that because every guy expects a girl to work out so she just says it. So not only did she trick me but she also lied to me about something I love doing with my lady friends.

I told her that I didn‚Äôt want to be with someone who lies about their body or lies to get someone to be with them, but honestly i was just grossed out by how much her gut hanged.

34,q0rpf9,1633297998,Big-time Heartbreak üòî,"Hello everyone, this is something I have never really done before but my heart hurts and I just really wanted to reach out and pick other people‚Äôs minds anonymously.

To introduce the situation, I am a mid-20s male. I currently work for a Member of Congress, am a USMC vet, have a nice apartment very little debt and a college degree. I recently got a divorce earlier this year for which the reasons I have totally owned. It was 90% my fault that it led to that. Mid-September I decided to maybe try dating again after a friend suggested I look into Facebook Dating. I decided to join and was very impressed with the types of girls I was seeing and matching with. Within the first day of joining I matched with a girl who basically was everything I was interested in. Beautiful, smart, ambitious, et cetera. What I saw in her she would go on to share she saw in me as well. Essentially, we checked all of each other‚Äôs boxes.

After a couple of days of chatting, I offered to take her on a date. It went extremely well, we ended up getting ice cream after dinner at a very renowned restaurant in our area and decided to see each other again. During this first date I confided in her that I was previously married which that did not deter her at all. The second date was 4 days later, we had a nice lunch and then spent hours at a park just talking and getting to know each other. 

The third date was 2 days later. We had dinner at a Thai restaurant, nothing fancy. I‚Äôm still relatively new to this city I live in so she offered to show me around. We ended up at her apartment and kissed and held each other for hours that night. We tried sex but not to flatter myself I was ‚Äútoo big‚Äù so we abandoned that plus we acknowledged that it was still early to do that. We continued to talk and kiss and embrace each other until I needed to go as I had work the next morning. She confessed to me that it was in her plans to somehow get me back to her apartment which I do not expect to happen that night. I really wanted to take this relationship slow as my previous marriage was the result of things moving too fast, but I really had come to like this girl and if she was okay with it moving this fast, then I was too. The next night I came over to her apartment again and we embraced each other and then eventually made love, I ended up spending the night and the next morning before I had to leave for work she made me breakfast as I threw my suit on and was out the door. That same day we had dinner at a spot near my place and then she ended up spending the night at my apartment, we did also have sex this night again. We had also decided together that we would be exclusively dating each other, it made me very happy. I told her more about my past struggles, especially with pornography, which led to the demise of my previous marriage, and she told me about hers as well. It just seemed at the time we were two imperfect people perfect for each other.

The morning after she spent the night at my apartment I made her breakfast and we enjoyed each other‚Äôs company. I walked her back to her car and then we briefly spoke on the phone until she had to go into work. While I was at work she texted me and asked if it was okay if we were not as physical; I told her it was absolutely okay and I did not want her to be uncomfortable. From there we had a conversation on the phone later that night and we decided that we would be less physical but we would still be exclusively dating each other, that we were boyfriend/girlfriend.

The next day communication was simply not there. She was distant and short with texts. We had spoke on the phone later that night for about 20 minutes and planned for the next day what we would do, which leads us to today.

Today we were supposed to have lunch and go to a museum. She told me she had to cancel those plans, and with how distant and uncommunicative she was, I could tell that this was going to be the end. I texted her how I felt about the situation and asked if she would call me, she did almost right away. I told her that I really liked her and that I thought we were in the beginning of something special, but that I knew that she was having second thoughts about us together, and she confided in me that she was. She stated that she thinks I‚Äôm a terrific guy who checks all of her boxes, that she appreciated me being open and honest with her, but her feelings changed for reasons she attributed to being in toxic relationships in the past. That basically the fact that I was a genuine, honest guy for some reason made her reverse her feelings. I told her that I was sorry and that it was probably best that we go our own ways, and we today split amicably. We are more or less remaining friends, but we haven‚Äôt known each other for a long time so I don‚Äôt expect really for us to be a significant part of our lives or even to even talk anymore.

I decided to reach out on here because I don‚Äôt really have people I can confide in or talk to. I know that we dove into things way too fast and that she‚Äôs not going to be wanting to revisit where we are. I have no illusions about that. I just don‚Äôt understand why she feels she can‚Äôt have a relationship with me because of the way she was treated in past relationships. It really breaks my heart. This isn‚Äôt the first girl I dated that also had issues from previous relationships, and I‚Äôve seen it happen to friends as well. 

I know it is probably stupid to be so heartbroken after dating a girl for only two weeks, but I really dug her and after going through a very painful divorce earlier in the year, it was refreshing to meet someone that I could invest myself and my time into. I know that she could have entirely different reasons for wanting to end things as well, I am just relaying what she told me her reasoning is so please don‚Äôt beat me up on that too much. I really thought I have been doing everything right, especially in terms of being open and honest, especially about my addiction I had to pornography which is one of the most embarrassing things for me to talk about. Having my heart broken big time twice in one year has really discouraged me from wanting to date. It just really sucks that I put my heart on the line so early and it didn‚Äôt turn out. 

Tl;dr I met a girl after getting divorced earlier this year, fell in love and she changed her feelings because I wasn‚Äôt toxic like her previous boyfriends (her words essentially not mine).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0rpf9/bigtime_heartbreak/

38,q0rzsm,1633298933,Ok ‚Äî question,"If you‚Äôre seeing someone under the premise of neither party being ‚Äúinterested in a relationship,‚Äù is it ethically questionable to sleep with someone else?

The last time we had the talk was about a month ago. Dude had just gotten out of a five-year relationship, and I was uninterested in serious dating because I was starting to like my freedom as a single lady and I just need to work on mental health stuff some more. We hung out several times a week and even went on some things that resembled dates. He told me he cared about me and wanted to support me. But, due to no fault of his own, the time came when I needed support and he couldn‚Äôt offer any‚Äîbecause it reminded him of his previous relationship. 

I got the signal when he ignored me for three days. And that hurt, since I believed that he cared for me. Now that I have some distance, though, I understand. 

So I told him I was going to take a trip for a couple weeks and that I would catch him on the flip slide. That didn‚Äôt feel rash‚Äîit felt right. 

But on said trip, I met a guy. We hung out for about five days before things progressed to romantic territory. And when that happened, I felt guilty, since I was still thinking about the other guy. But why should anything be on my conscience if we were never in a relationship to begin with?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0rzsm/ok_question/

40,q0s7t7,1633299650,Blunt vs agreeable women (or men),"I [M31] went on a few dates with a girl [F31] who was so blunt it surprised me. She told me about her ex-husband, she told me she thought I was kind of goofy on my first date, she called me out acting fake when we went to a social together... Pretty soon I was calling her out on her stuff too. At first I thought she was an a$$ but I took her comments to heart and started being brutally honest about everything. I am a little bit goofy but a lot of it is a self-defence mechanism so I tried cutting that out.

Contrast this to a date that I just had today [F28] where she was really agreeable. I noticed her saying ""that's awesome"" and ""that's cool"" even before I finished explaining what I was taking about. She agreed with some things that I KNEW she didn't understand. It felt inauthentic and imo less attractive.

I always thought it's best to slowly introduce your real self over a few dates because your opinions/beliefs/values/preferences/idiosyncrasies can shock the other person and be a little off-putting (as in, they'd be OK with them if you showed it to them slowly over a few dates vs. just coming out strong right out of the gate), but these 2 experiences make me almost think I should just be me right from the get-go.

48,q0su0g,1633301739,Men of Reddit‚Ä¶ this is the only dating advice you need:,"**many of you will most likely disagree with me (women especially) but it‚Äôs the truth**

Just focus on yourself man. Stop chasing women‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt chase them over here. Learn a martial art, go back to school, work overtime (60+ hours a week), save up some money, invest in yourself‚Ä¶ invest in a business. Invest in real estate.

If you‚Äôre not content with yourself, then start making a change now. If you‚Äôre a fat fucker, monitor your diet and get rid of all the sugars and fats. Get more active. If you‚Äôre ugly asf or not happy with how you look, save up to get that plastic surgery. As shallow as it may sound, just do it. 

I‚Äôm not encouraging you to be a shallow dude or a stuck up douchebag, just make changes and discipline yourself to not put them on a pedestal and get on your shit. Im sick of logging onto Reddit and reading all these posts about ‚Äúwhat happened?‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm devastated‚Äù or ‚Äúi give up‚Äù and all this other blah blah blah worrying about women bs.

I get it. We men have testosterone and a sex drive. If you‚Äôre like me (high sex drive) stay BUSY!!! Workout, go to school. Ifff you simply can‚Äôt live without having to talk to women or wanting to meet them, download a fucking dating app, and ONLY like back the girls that like you and that you like back physically (we all know that tinder and bumble gives away potential matches with the blurry pics and names). This works for me and I‚Äôm average looking. You don‚Äôt have to be a very hot dude. This saves you a lot of time and it works for me. I don‚Äôt even swipe on women that I find attractive. Just the ones that I like back from the blurry likes.

Be honest with them. Have a good convo and then tell her what your intentions are. If it‚Äôs not really a match, move on. Don‚Äôt do anything else. Idc how hot she is, or how good the convo was, I‚Äôm not wasting my time. I‚Äôve dated and slept with a good amount of women (for someone who doesn‚Äôt chase them) and trust me‚Ä¶ women that truly like you WILL NOT say shit like ‚ÄúIdk I‚Äôll let you know‚Äù or ‚Äúlet‚Äôs talk more first‚Äù.. believe me. 

Could I have slept with or dated more women if I chased and tried ? Maybe, but like I said earlier ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt chase em over here.‚Äù I gotta upgrade to be a better man and you should too. Watch how they will chase (hotter ones) once you upgrade just a little bit. It‚Äôs like passing a new level in a video game and unlocking a skill.

50,q0syt8,1633302171,I'm scared of dating...,"This is kind of a long-post-turned-vent-turned-ramble but please bear with me.

I'm still quite young, so I've only been in one relationship so far which ended... not very well. It was traumatising, put simply. It didn't even start well either; our relationship was toxic from the start but she hurt me more than it hurt us both- anyway, I won't go into details. 

But that's not the only reason I'm scared of dating. It's also very hard for me to be vulnerable in front of people - whether I'm interested in them romantically or they're just friends - to the point where I don't even know if there's anyone who truly knows me for who I am. It makes me feel alone at the same time, and it's all my fault. Someone once even confessed to me but I had to reject them because it wasn't /me/ they liked, but the fa√ßade I put on to everyone around me. It may sound edgy or whatever, but it's true. I can't let anyone in out of this fear of being hurt/rejected.

However, I have had people like me. I was quite oblivious at the time, but now it's very obvious, but that probably stems from the fact that I didn't believe it was possible that someone would even think of me that way, right? Like, why me? I'm a nobody. These thoughts also led to me being uncomfortable with being liked. If someone shows genuine interest in me I get uneasy and threatened, to some degree, and I don't know why. Why am I so afraid? 

Despite all that, I still want to try dating again. Maybe this time it will go well. Maybe if I'm in control, if I'm the one approaching, then it will go well... but that comes with the risk of my feelings being one-sided and ultimately getting rejected... which is another one of my fears.

 I don't even know where to start and how to meet people- although, I won't lie, there is one person that comes to mind, but there are so many things that could go wrong with that. We met online a few months ago, we barely talk due to both being busy with school (we watch shows and movies together regularly, though! I don't think this happens exclusively between us, though)... Buuut, we are kind of close friends I'd say, they definitely showed more vulnerability than I did (my fault, again), and I know they trust me enough to vent about their hardships to me. That's still something you can do with a friend without it being romantic, though, so I shouldn't feel special- I don't even know if I should pursue this small crush or like or whatever it is. I don't even know if I have the guts to make any moves in the first place. Do I even like them that way? Or am I just hyperfixated on them? 

Why is this so complicated... Anyway, I didn't plan on writing this much, but if anyone reads and/or replies with advice or any kind of words- thank you. I really need it ahhaha",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0syt8/im_scared_of_dating/

53,q0t4p7,1633302712,What is the appropriate social media posting etiquette while dating?,"Here‚Äôs my situation.  I‚Äôve been dating my gf for 3 years now.  Like all relationships when they start we couldn‚Äôt wait to talk, message/call each other, hear from one another etc‚Ä¶.  As time goes on I understand the honeymoon phase eventually ends.  Cool, no issues there.  However we rarely see each other for various reasons (distance being the main factor). I still look forward to her calls, texts, conversations everyday, just as much as I always have to be honest.  I don‚Äôt post much on social media anymore because honestly, I‚Äôd rather just send it to her.  I like keeping things just between us and not feeling the need to share it with the whole world.  She however is a little different. She is on it all the time, posting all the time, quotes, pics, selfies, motivational stuff etc‚Ä¶.  She mentions people she talks to on there, groups she‚Äôs in etc etc‚Ä¶.  Honestly it‚Äôs getting annoying.   I went a whole week without even looking at her page because I just couldn‚Äôt take the story posts.  Specifically the quotes about healthy relationships.  Which she seems to rather post about then practice. This morning I sent her some sexy pics.  We don‚Äôt send those to each other a lot so I thought I‚Äôd change things up a bit.  She loved them, but right after that, she updated her story with what she was wearing for the day captioning ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù to the whole world (everybody but me) and the only reason I saw it was because I checked her story.  She never even sent them to me.    

My question is, am I being stupid?  Part of me is posting this because I‚Äôm hoping I go back and read it and think I‚Äôm being an idiot. Another part feels like I‚Äôm really not being stupid and that focusing more on communication through social media can really be unhealthy in relationships, taking that time away from the real people in your life that matter.  I actually brought it up to her that I was upset, and her response was ‚Äúsorry my posts make you upset‚Äù, and then sent me another pic of her in the same outfit she never sent in the first place while updating all her followers first.  I know my feelings are valid, but is this something that isn‚Äôt as big as I‚Äôm making it out to be?  I feel like the healthiest relationships come from people who are confident enough in themselves and their relationships that they don‚Äôt need the internets validation.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0t4p7/what_is_the_appropriate_social_media_posting/

Unfortunately after spending a few weekends cuddling with him I found out he has a GIRLFRIEND.

This Saturday we were both home alone. He told me his GIRLFRIEND was in the hospital for her drinking problem, so she wouldn't be coming over.

Then he invited me into his room to watch a movie. I went in BECAUSE I was lonely (it was Saturday night) and honestly I do like this guy.

However, the guy asked me to cuddle and I said no. I just coudn't bring myself to cuddle with him knowing he has a GF.

So he just cuddled his pillow and I awkwardly sat quietly next to him for the movie in his bed.

64,q0u2c6,1633305934,Why is she still messaging me?,"So I went on a date with a woman I met on Hinge yesterday and I felt as though the date didn't go great. Nothing really happened but I didn't feel like the vibes were the best. We met at a donut shop in the morning for coffee and a quick bite and had a meaningful conversation, and there was even a point where I mentioned that if she needed to go (her sister was coming into town that morning so I wanted to respect time, both hers and my own) that it would be totally cool. She said she wanted to stay so I was like oh, okay great. We kept talking and I tried to make two subtle attempts to suggest a second date by asking her about food options in town (I just moved) and she seemingly shot them both down. No big deal, but it gave me the impression that she wasn't interested.

After the date we parted ways, hugged, and I was like yea that was a dud, but it's all good, ya live ya learn. 

I didn't text her (I should also mention that I gave her my number and after she still kept texting in the app, I thought it was a safety thing which I understand but now idk...) because I assumed we were done. This morning while I'm on another date she messages me on the app thanking me for showing her a new donut place and  mentions that she had fun. No suggestion for another date or that she'd like to see me again. I thought it was strange but tried to not read into it too much so I message something funny and then ask a question about her time with her sister to see if it was just a kind way to let me down and see if she was planning on ghosting or not or if she wanted to keep talking. She's still messaging me on the app (though she has my number) telling me about her day. What the fuck is going on? She hasn't suggested seeing me again but keeps talking to me and I 100% thought after we hugged and parted ways she was going to unmatch me (I almost did it myself but got busy).

TLDR: Had a very okay date with a girl that has my number but won't text me. Thought we were done and she keeps messaging me without suggesting another date.

Any thoughts on this because I'm very particular about my time and will happily just unmatch her if she's trying to waste it but am trying to be a little less harsh.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0u2c6/why_is_she_still_messaging_me/

70,q0uaq0,1633306730,Girl wants to slow things down,"Hope everyone had a great weekend. I will try and keep this short but really need some advice. I started dating this girl about a month ago but have known of each other for a little while. Our first date was amazing, ended up lasting.two days. Instantly felt super comfortable around each other, since that first date have been spending lots of time together - 2-4 times a week., texting lots, amazing chemistry and sex. But It all got a bit emotionally intense the last week or so and we both said some pretty intense things in the moment; stuff along the lines of 'I really like you' 'Haven't felt this way in ages' 'I hate sleeping without you' etc etc.

A couple nights ago she came to a party I was at. She had been acting kind of off the whole night. Not physically distant but emotionally. when we get back to hers she opened up to me about some stuff in her past and said it had been on her mind all night, I listened and hugged her. She then said she didn't want it to change how I felt and I assured her it wouldn't at all. Come the morning we are both super hungover but she's still acting weird. We spend the day in bed then later she just says randomly 'I really don't wan to rush this'. That then opens up into a convo about our situation. Where she says that she feels like everything has got a bit intense and some of the things we've both said has been too much too soon. I agree with her because I had also felt like it was a lot when we've only been dating for a month. She said she wants to keep things causal and 'reel things in' a bit. I felt kinda shot when she said that because I felt like she was pulling away. I just said I am sorry if I came across too strong and that I agree with her and feel the same. She told me it was nothing I did wrong and that she doesn't want me to worry or overthink the conversation.

 But in the same convo she said she wasn't speaking to anyone else and asked if I was, I told her no and we both agreed to just communicate with each other if anything changes. She also said she wants to spend more quality time together going forward, as a lot of our 'dates' haven't even really been dates but just hanging at her house and spending nights together.

After the convo I felt super confused and kind of shot down? Felt like I have done something wrong or have made her feel bad which I never want to do. Part of me now feels like I want to run away from it all; I guess I feel embarrassed. Since our talk yesterday we have texted a bit and she said she was feeling really good about everything and felt really happy that we spoke about it? so I guess it was weighing on her mind. I know she's had a bad relationship earlier this year and so is still dealing with that, and I don't think she's had many positive dating experiences. I just told her there is no pressure and I just want her to be happy and enjoy herself.

I just feel super confused now. Like we became exclusive but also slowing things down at the same time? Just really feel like Ive done something wrong. I feel super vulnerable now as I really like this girl and for some reason I've convinced myself this convo means she doesn't like me?! How can I build her trust while not being overbearing?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0uaq0/girl_wants_to_slow_things_down/
71,q0uat1,1633306740,No guy should ever be ashamed of their penis no matter the size! Guys we love your all of your sizes! :D,"
I‚Äôm gonna go ahead and say this EVERY GIRL IS DIFFERENT AND WE ARE NOT A HIVEMIND.

I know lot of you are insecure about your penis so I‚Äôm gonna give some light on why you shouldn‚Äôt be insecure. And I‚Äôm talking about all sizes cuz I‚Äôve met some dudes with the biggest. One of them was huge and he told me he wished he was bigger and I didn‚Äôt really understand why cuz if it was it would‚Äôve probably went up my cervix. I think a big problem about sex is pornography and our sex education. Please don‚Äôt compare yourself to men in porn :( that‚Äôll just make everything worse. Also don‚Äôt let the women who suck shame you get you down sex is so much more than the size of you‚Äôre penis and to the ladies who have dick shamed men SHAME ON YOU YOU ARE WHATS WRONG WITH SOCIETY.


Want to know something? Most of us can‚Äôt orgasm from PIV alone.

I‚Äôve been with guys with small, average, and huge and wanna know what? When it comes to being with the bigger dudes they think that massive shlong is all they need to bring to the party and at the end of the day your cervix will hate you. Being huge can be a curse. I‚Äôve seen the outline of a dudes boner and I became very VERY afraid and got the hell out of there.

Im gonna talk about the big guys first. I know you must be proud of you‚Äôre member down there and good for you if you are but you can really hurt us if you are not careful and just because you‚Äôre big doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre talented in bed. Make sure you do lots of foreplay on us first so we can get as wet as possible. There are many sex positions and I think for big guys doggystyle is one of the best IF YOU ARE CAREFUL, AND USE LOTS OF LUBE. Missionary is a great position but not with my legs on you‚Äôre shoulders I‚Äôll hold them myself. Also reverse cowgirl is good because I have more control to how much dick goes in me. Also big dicks are harder to give blowjobs it‚Äôs not always fun and if I give you a bj I expect you to reciprocate and eat me out fair is fair.

Now I‚Äôm gonna address the penises on the smaller side. When it comes to smaller guys I have a bit of weight advice for ya. You may think you have a small dick but if you‚Äôve got some pounds on ya those lbs in the pelvic area might be hiding some extra inches and if you lose weight you might see those inches I‚Äôve known some guys who have lost weight and I noticed that their dick was bigger than it was before. With a smaller dick try putting a pillow under her ass when you are doing missionary because you can give her that full feeling this has worked for me plenty of times and it feels great. But before you put that dick in her please please please do lots of foreplay as it makes us really want you and beg for you. Now every girl is different but I love it when my neck gets sucked, kissing all around my breasts, pinching my nipples, rubbing circles around my nipples, kissing all around my belly, rubbing softly down the side of my thighs, kissing and sucking my thighs, I love being eaten out and fingered you gotta grove the clit lots of attention. Whoever you are with ask her what feels good to the clit and listen. Communication goes a long way :) also cowgirl is a great position. EXPERIMENT EXPERIMENT EXPERIMENT.

And now for the average dudes :D
If you are average then you are literally most men. Small and large are the minority. I‚Äôm going to be honest I believe I have had the best sex with guys who are average. So please don‚Äôt be ashamed that you are average and never EVER compare yourself (this goes for small guys as well) to a massive dick remember what I said at the top. For average the scissor position is great look it up and learn how to do it. For this size doggystyle is amazing because it‚Äôs not to big and not to small and if she has a big butt spread her cheeks for more insertion or have her do it. Cowgirl and reverse cowgirl are a great positions for this size. Oh and btw if you want to do anal bigger really isn‚Äôt better for that average and smaller is better in that area.

A few last things that I forgot to mention. One of those things is called girth. A girthy penis can be nice however depending on the size just like length there can be to big and to small so just like I keep saying no one is the same. 

Also I really wanted to touch on the subject of sex toys. I‚Äôve heard a lot of stories from my friends and friends of friends. And a lot of those stories involved boyfriends getting upset by the fact that their girlfriends want to use or are using sex toys. And I‚Äôve had partners who didn‚Äôt like the fact that I had a dildo and a vibrator and they didn‚Äôt like that I masturbated with them. When it comes to masturbation I get off easier than with a partner and I think that goes for both genders because during masturbation you don‚Äôt have to tell anyone what to do and you are doing it yourself and you know yourself best. So here is what I‚Äôm gonna say A SEX TOY CANNOT REPLACE YOU. I have had a few guys that like that I have sex toys and during foreplay a few of them were happy to use my dildo and vibrator on me and boy oh boy it was HOT. Again a toy can‚Äôt replace human intimacy so if you‚Äôre partner male or female wants a toy please don‚Äôt let that upset you it can totally spice up the bedroom.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0uat1/no_guy_should_ever_be_ashamed_of_their_penis_no/

The problem is that I‚Äôve never dated anyone, I‚Äôve never even had my first kiss. I guess I wasn‚Äôt even really ready in the past but the biggest problem for me are my parents. More specifically my dad who doesn‚Äôt let me date (I know I‚Äôm an adult now and he doesn‚Äôt have to *let me* and blah blah blah but it‚Äôs not that easy with strict parents). He never let me date when I was younger and he made me feel really shameful this one time when I just slightly smiled at a guy and he happened to notice it. He also made me feel like girls who have sex in high school are slu*s who become pregnant and he was always really scared that I would get pregnant in high school for some reason. So my parents made me go to an all-girls high school and I now I literally have 0 guy friends. I don‚Äôt know ANY guys except from my dad and my brother. It sucks because even if I wanted to start dating, I don‚Äôt know how or where to start. I don‚Äôt even know how to act around guys.. 

Plus I feel like it‚Äôs completely unrealistic when I‚Äôm living at home because every time I leave my house, my dad is always like suspicious of me even tho all I do is hang out at the shopping mall with my friends or alone. Like every time I stay out a little late (I mean like past 7pm), he doesn‚Äôt believe me when I tell him who I was with or where I was at (even tho all my life I hang out with 2/3 of the same friends and at like 3 places). I‚Äôm pretty sure he would flip the hell out if I told him I had a date or something like that. 

Does anyone have any experiences with dating and strict parents? If yes, did your parents ever overcome this or did their attitude ever change? Share your experience please if you ever had to / have to deal with it.

Anyway, I‚Äôll be moving to another city for university in a couple months and I‚Äôm not really planning on dating until then because I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôll be easier to date when I‚Äôm there. But I‚Äôm still looking for some advice because there‚Äôs a big chance that I‚Äôll move back in after uni plus if I ever date anyone, I can‚Äôt even imagine introducing him to my parents or like telling my parents I‚Äôm dating someone‚Ä¶.

But they were very pushy, aggressive, rude, disrespectful ,controlling (wouldn't even let me talk to family members), and basically stalked me. I tend to attract really aggressive controlling hypermasculine guys who unironically call themselves alpha males. Not remotely my type.

 I like guys who are less aggressive and actually give a shit about my boundaries and don't try to isolate me. And are okay with me being a switch. Long story short I freaked out every time and break it off. My mom says this is how men normally act when they like someone but that behavior freaks me out because I do not like that nasty ass domineering alpha male attitude. Its really toxic and unattractive but guys who don't get like that never talk to me. Protective tendencies are fine, as a matter of fact I like it. Being assertive I like, but really aggressive violent types who are constantly threatening to ""beat my ass"" because they saw someone (who I most likely didn't notice) gawking at me and therefore think Im fucking around on them scare the SHIT out of me. But controlling, aggressive, pushy behavior? Instant turn off. No thanks. Nasty. Take that shit elsewhere.

Does this make me undateable then? Am I asking for something unrealistic or unreasonable? Because I have seen tons of guys out there who have what I'm looking for. They just don't want me.

87,q0v1sy,1633309444,Dating advice for an average guy,"I'm average or maybe slightly below. In my early thirties and live with my parents. All the women I've been with have left me. I know living with parents is a taboo but I grew up poor and had to help support my parents and also take care of a sick relative. 

Things I have going for me:

*Full time job
*Substantial savings
*No criminal record
*Vehicle in good condition
*Good hygiene (shower daily etc)
*No STDs
*Fairly literate for a high school graduate
*Not obese
*No children/never married
*No drugs or alcohol

All that being said, I know what my league is. I tend to go for thicker girls that would more likely be described as ""cute"" than hot by most guys. That's what I like. The America Ferrara body type. 

So my question is, if I have reasonable standards and I do have something to offer in the way of stability, why am I so repulsive or uninteresting to women?

There's also a lot of YouTube channels to help men level up. While I might not agree with all of their takes on dating, I think a lot of the advice is actually tangible and gives men advice step by step on how to meet, engage with, and attract women.

There's almost nothing like that geared towards women, not from the female lense. 

All the advice for women pretty much boils down to ""don't be fat"" ""approach men first"" ""lower your standards and stop chasing men with options.""

For once I'd love advice on what men want, how to level up as a woman and attract the type of man you want, how to be the best option for someone even if they have options. Where to go, how to approach them, actual tangible advice. If there was a female version of Todd Valentine's advice for example, I'd be set.

Hello, [r/dating](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/)

Just to preface - I'm new to dating

I  need some advice on my predicament. Over the last few weeks I went on 3  dates with a woman and we had a swell time - we're both in our  early/mid 20s. During our most recent date I noticed some, what I  thought were, red flags:

1. Calling herself ugly - saying she looks gross (Who doesn't have self esteem issues - lord knows I do)
2. Asking  me 2 times if I had any red flags (Maybe there was a red flag she was  hiding - I'm going to attribute this to overthinking)
3. She  told me she liked me a few times and I was easy on the eyes (Red flag  at the time since I wasn't used to this - who would ""like"" my ass - I'm  overweight so its kinda weird to hear that)

So  I did the classic ""Go home and over think things into oblivion"". I then  decided to tell her I wasn't feeling a connection and we should stop.

Since  then I've been having second thoughts - Maybe I should have stuck it  out for a while longer. I felt as though my decision was a bit rash  (I've been trying to be a move decisive person recently so I just said  fuck it this is what I'm doing while still being a bit confused).  Thinking about it now she was pretty quiet at the beginning and began to  open up a bit more and probably would have continued to do so after.  She was pretty cool when talkative so its not like her personality was a  problem. There is also a bit of nervousness on my part so I think that  affected my decision making.

So for my questions

1. Would  it be appropriate to try and get back with her (I think there may be a  better word to use here, ""rekindle"" maybe?). We went on 3 dates and had a  4th planned. I'd rather do something and regret doing it then regret  not acting - like I see on [r/LifeProTips](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/) all the time.
2. If yes, then do I just be honest and tell her basically what I told all of you? Whats the game plan here?

Additionally  - If I'm being a moron here please tell me. I'm new to this so I'm  trying to process all of the view points and information here, although  it can be difficult.

Thanks for your help in advance.
