3,r82p6x,1638548211,Having passions and hobbies is crucial for self-esteem. Never put the opposite sex at the center of your universe,"In our busy modern lives, we can get caught in a cycle of merely existing. We work, run errands, maybe get some exercise in here and there. We put our own development, interests, and passions on the back burner.

It has to stop. Your personal interests, your pursuit of your passion should be your priority. This doesn’t mean necessarily that your passion has to be your job. However, often times your hobbies and passions will create unexpected opportunities for entrepreneurship, even if it isn’t your primary source of income.

Personally, my passion is writing. While it currently isn’t my primary job, I’m pursuing my writing primarily because I enjoy it, but utilizing it to supplement my income, and hopefully transition in a full time career.

You should never pursue a passion to attract the opposite sex, but nonetheless, one of the most attractive general traits is a someone with passion for something that isn’t just their relationship . When men and women alike put a romantic interest at the center of their universe, neediness ensues. This doesn’t mean you should emotionally neglect your partner if you’re in a relationship, but reversely, neglecting your own self-development for the sake of a relationship will turn you into an unbalanced, unattractive person.

Many people say that they don’t know what their passion is. This is normal, but often times they know, but they just don’t want to reveal to themselves or others what they truly want. This is a deeply personal component of who we are, and it makes us vulnerable to pursue and put out into the universe what we want.

The worst thing you can do is let the opinion of others deter you. You will always have people who will dissuade you, mock you, and not believe in you. It’s because they themselves are scared. It’s something you have to accept and press on.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r82p6x/having_passions_and_hobbies_is_crucial_for/

This is my dilemma. When I’m the actual heck is there time to pursue a relationship?

I feel like I’m always working, always stressed and always exhausted. When I’m not working I’m being mom and doing chores, working on house updates and all of that. I live in the suburbs for the school district. In my area it feels like all eligible men are in the cities. So to do on a date I need to pay for a sitter and drive roughly 30 minutes every time. When I go on dates I’m so burnt out by just life I guess that it’s hard to be particularly fun or charming.

7,r83cm3,1638549990,"I'm finally (kind of) ready to date, and I'm trying OLD, but I'm struggling to find anyone I'm interested in. Has anyone had a similar experience?","I (23m) been feeling isolated and touch-starved for years, but it's been a lot worse since COVID. Dating has always been something that I thought I should do ""soon, but not right now because I need to go study."" Or something similar. I suppose it's partly that I *do* need to study, but also partly fear and partly that I'm somewhat embarrassed about my lack of life experience.

Except that now it's been years, nothing has changed, and unless I'm proactive about this I can 100% guarantee that nothing *will* change for at least another four or five years. And, honestly, I don't know that my mental health can survive another half-decade of isolation.

Well, I mentioned a watered-down version of this to my brother and he suggested that I try online dating. Not for ""casual"" stuff, because afaik that's code for something I'm not interested in, but because my school has like 1500 women and 5000 men so everyone I've ever been interested in here already has an SO (afaik).

The single women around here, at least those who aren't from the town, all seem to be freshmen. As a new grad student, even if I don't have much actual life experience I feel super uncomfortable intentionally pursuing an 18-19 YO who is on their own for the first time. I think it feels too close to pursuing a highschool student or something, in terms of maturity and experience, and that just doesn't sit right with me.

However, I've been poking around with bumble and hinge, because I've heard that those are two of the most popular-yet-not-hookup apps around, and I'm *really* struggling to be interested in anyone on them. 

I literally can't imagine what dating someone would look like except for this fantasy I have of curling up on the couch with a fuzzy blanket and someone I care about so we can watch Star Trek or something together.

I've never been on a date in my life, so I'm definitely not ready to drive to hours to meet the cute Vet Tech who has her shit together and is looking to give her fur babies a dad. But I'm also not interested in the people who talk about shotgunning beer and partying hard. Or the people who only mention sports.

The people with informative or interesting bios (or a good joke), who appear to be in a similar stage of life as me, and who I think are aesthetically pretty are the easiest to imagine talking to and the easiest to imagine spending time with. So I'll send them a message or a like, but those people are so few and far between (comparatively). Maybe one in two dozen or more.

Honestly, I feel like everyone I see has an incomplete bio (or just pictures and I get next to nothing from that), they're obviously in a different stage of life, or they just aren't appealing to me for whatever reason. 

None of this is a judgement on anyone I've seen; I'm sure everyone I saw is a great person. I'm just getting the sense that OLD isn't something that will work for me, especially since afaik it's a just a numbers game for most men and women are inundated by suitors. Meanwhile I'm just busy deciding whether we'd even have anything to talk about. 

Anyone else have a similar experience, or is it just the gray-asexual part of me causing problems for myself?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r83cm3/im_finally_kind_of_ready_to_date_and_im_trying/

I was talking to this really attractive guy on tinder two years ago. We both really liked each other. He told me that I was really hot and the cutest guy in town. We went on a date and held hands and made out a few times.

 We kept texting afterwards and he told me that he was obsessed with me, falling for me, that he could see himself spending his life with me, and that he might be my perfect match, things that no one's ever said to me before. I made him lose all those feelings by being clingy and needy after he said that it seemed like I wasn't sure if I wanted to be with him because I said I was concerned that we might not be sexually compatible because he was very sexual while we were talking and I'm a virgin and a little nervous about being penetrated. 

 I sent him a bunch of messages asking him to reconsider. I just didn't want to lose him. And then he said I acted crazy and made me lose his feelings for means that he might be able to get those feelings back if I had sex with him. I told him that I didn't want to have sex with someone until I was in a relationship or at least until I knew for more than a few weeks and he said I was stubborn for thinking that and we stopped talking. I went back and forth between thinking that he just wanted to have sex with me and being upset that I lost him since then. 

I messaged him recently on social media and asked him if he really liked me and I ruined it or if he just wanted to sleep with me and he confirmed that he liked me in the beginning and then I ruined it. I had a really attractive guy who really liked me and of course I had to ruin it. I guess I'm not surprised that I fucked it up. It sounds like something I'd do.

We watched on tinder, they never asked me out even thought I made it clear I was ok with a date (or so I assume). We did a FaceTime and it was great, 3-4 hours of great convo. Then things died down and I assumed it was because of the holidays. I tried to create engaging conversations and they returned it, to some degree. Texting was more sporadic, a few text in a day and a day of no response.  Then no more text for 4 days. So I took it as not interested and conversation had ceased.

I don’t really know the person, as we never met in person and conversation appears to be drying out now. Is it ghosting if I stop responding? He doesn’t ask me any questions in the last text, just a response to a question/statement I made. All he said was “I thought I responded to this! I’m so sorry.” 

But, I personally used that line when I was younger and immature and was about to do the whole fade out process…so I guess you can say I smell BS.

15,r840vr,1638551755,Sick of dating ppl with no intentions of being serious,"Hey everyone! First time posting on this forum, but only because you all helped me realize this dudes behavior is shitty and I deserve better. Also, you all are getting me through and keeping me strong! Okay, so here goes..

In May 2021 I started “dating” this guy I know from work. We work in the same building just not directly together so I don’t see him often if at all so it’s manageable. 

Anyways, this dude and I scheduled our first day in May 2021 after A YEAR. 1 YEAR. Of him trying to hit me up and get me to hangout with him. In May 2020 he was consistently hitting me up and trying to hangout but I was not interested at the time and would just put it off. 

May 2021 rolls around and we somehow make plans which I do finally follow through with and it was genuinely a great time. We went out for a nice dinner together then met up with his cousins &amp; friends at a neighborhood bar. We walk back to his house where he kissed me and said he should’ve done this long ago. He hits me up the next day, invites me to a bbq with his fam/friends but it’s Memorial Day weekend so I can’t go as I already have plans. Spoke all weekend things were normal.

Fast forward and I continue to hang out with this dude all summer. We go on dates, we go out together with friends, we have sleepovers. ITS CUTE. He’s sweet &amp; I am genuinely catching feelings for this guy. 
He never says no to what I want to do, he always answers and is available only issue I have is lack of communication with him. I chalk this up to him being shy. He really is a quieter guy, but as time goes on I start to call him out for this. It’s a few months in and by this point you should be comfortable at this point. He gets a little better but still not what I want. I want him to match my energy at this point. 

September rolls around and things still aren’t the way I want and I start distancing myself. I should have stopped while I was ahead because I feel like he barely noticed I was backing away which pissed me off even more, I can’t lie. Now we’re going back and forth but I’m not begging some one to spend time with me. 

Last time he asked me to hang out, my girl friend enlightens me  and fills me in on the “trick” to make these men work for me and ask questions to see what these men’s intentions are. 

So I’m doing my thing and I basically realized this whole thing was just to fuck. He never wanted anything serious with me despite his actions.

I just don’t get why go through all of that and put so much effort into this when you only wanted sex. Worst part is, I blatantly had a conversation with him if he had feelings for me or if it was just a friends with benefits situation. I feel so deceived and mad that I wasted this time and on him. I’m tired of putting energy into things with people who have no intentions of anything serious. I work too hard to be wasting my time .

I’ve been talking to this guy for about 2 months and I’m not sure what to do at this point. I recently told him I wanted to take a step back because of issues in my own life so we both agreed a friendship is better. However, I’m starting to notice some things about him. He’s extremely insecure. If we’re on the phone and a family member or friend calls, he’ll get angry if I take the call. I always reassure and let him know I’ll return his call and I always do but usually once I call him back, he’ll start questioning why I took their call or he’ll say something along the lines of “I guess I’m not entertaining enough”. If I’m with a family member, he’ll keep calling and went as far as telling me “you’re acting different “ all because I didn’t answer or respond as soon as he texts or calls. He also has a habit of calling me back to back until I finally answer the phone and he wants to know what I was doing when I don’t answer straight away. 

When I want time to myself or with my daughter, he’ll keep calling as well. I’ve already firmly but politely told him on a few occasions I don’t like when he does these things and he always apologizes but he keeps doing it. I don’t know what more to do. I recently learned he struggles with his mental health and as a person who deals with it a lot in my personal life, It’s getting to a point where it’s affecting my anxiety badly.

We are long distance and idk what this ship of relation is lol. So yes I still have other guy friends but I have not wanted to be intimate for real.

Once, a long time ago, he told me I shared my indefinite location once before with him.
That I have never done/nor recall. 

A few weeks he ago he said something along the lines of him having my location/or that he could get it. And whenever I’m like “I did not do that”, or I’ll laugh it off, he doesn’t deny that he’s being serious but either moves onto the next topic or says nothing else. 

Recently, we were talking something I brought up and he says this:

“Also if I was the type of individual needing to know something that you are doing and you were moving different. It wouldn’t be hard to get the 411 on you. There’s people to this day that voluntarily tell me information about people because they “think” I interact with this person. There’s people on campus who do that now and it isn’t you who think they are👀🤷🏽‍♂️💯.”

I do want something serious. I am looking for that, but I want to get to know the person first and take my time. I think that's reasonable.

I am talking to a few guys. Trying to go out on some first dates. One of them I have been talking to for a week and a half and we are meeting for the first time. He keeps making comments that once he meets me, he wants to make me not single anymore. Am I wrong for not wanting that yet, but still wanting to continue to see him if it goes well? Maybe after a few times I'd be more serious about that, but already? It's making me really anxious. I'm interested, but I'm not ready for that quite yet. 

One of the other guys I am talking to is an ex boyfriend of 2 years. We split because he was unhappy with himself. And we met in our 20s. We spent almost a year apart and I dated someone else in that time frame that turned out to be a train wreck. From my understanding, and what I saw, he successfully turned his life around for the better. He dealt with some trauma and had to set boundaries with family. His career improved, his living situation improved, started seeing a counselor, everything. Then he comes back to me wanting another chance and I told him I needed to time to work through it. He agreed to be patient while I figure things out. He is aware I'm talking to other people. I've hid nothing from him. This could be part of my problem of wanting to go slow with the other guy so I can figure everything out. But I really do feel like only meeting someone once is too fast to be someone's girlfriend.

Later that night he sends me a text telling me how he adored every minute spent with me and apologized for not inviting me to his place that night because he was tired, but that never popped in my mind and didn’t find that it was a big deal since it was only the second date. 

Well, It’s been a week and I haven’t heard from him yet. The only interaction we had since the last date was through social media, I replied to a picture he posted on ig, privately, and he only “liked” my message. I wanted to message him to make plans again but I didn’t want to be the one to do it again, especially after he only “liked” my last message with no reply. 

I’m not sure if I’m over thinking things but I feel like he’s not interested anymore since he hasn’t said anything yet. Should I be the one to text him again for another date?

A lot of dating apps used to be a lot better before 2015. Okcupid used to be the best with all the questions, but now it feels like them along with everyone else is trying to copy tinder. Along with that I've noticed there's only filipino women on there, and there are no women from the states on there at all. 

Same with pof after 2017 or so. Pof also made it a rule where you can't message more than 25 people, and I have seen a lot less women on there. Badoo is the worst and mainly has meth addicts, people with no jobs, etc.

Tinder and Bumble have more, but I wonder if  they are bot profiles. Because the women on there look a lot better than pof, okcupid, and badoo. I tried meetme, but it's kind of weird and there's a bunch of already married women that state so in their profile and there just looking for friends or a third women for their relationship.

I thought of creating another instagram, is that a good way to meet women nowadays or no? I created one before, but couldn't find anyone to talk to on there and it seemed there was no purspose or no way to even talk to people on there unless you already knew them. It seemed kind of like facebook where people only add and talk to other family members or people they know. Am I right on this, or should I go back to trying instagram, and was there something I missed? I messaged a few women, but never got a response. Idk if I needed to take more pictures. Or if I'm right on my conclusion that people won't add you unless you know them.

I recently saw a youtube video on the ""dead internet"" theory and it seems like there's a lot of truth in it because it's harder to get to meet people to talk to. I remember back before 2015 when everyone was on okcupid and skype it was easier to find people to meet and people actually responded. I think that tinder and bumble are using bot profiles to trick people into thinking that their are more women in the dating pool. And I don't even know what the point of instagram is? Sould I recreate a profile on there and try to find women in the 25-35 age range on there, or am I right on my assumption that it's not possible to date women off of instagram?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r85w6q/what_is_the_best_appapps_to_meet_women_2535_age/

I'm still in love with him somehow but to be honest I don't want to meet him anymore. He is nice to me but at the end of the day he doesn't look like a great partner and I don't want to pull those thing closer to me. I want to get some distance from him.

34,r865ps,1638557368,Is this normal for modern dating or am I crazy?,"Last year I dated this guy for a few months that had pursued me for a long time. I wasn’t initially that interested but the more I got to know him I was.

We dating for maybe four months and it was fun! We went on nice dates, hooked up had movie nights etc. Then things started to be kind of off. Hitting me up less to go on nice dates, hearing from him less, taking longer to respond etc. (the normal fade out). He would ask me what I was doing, but not make a plan 🤨

I just let it ride for a while and it just got worse. It would be days between hearing from him. So I asked him via text I said “it kind of seems like you don’t want to see me anymore? Which is fine, but this exhausting and confusing.” Like I had never had a guy not officially end something with me(?)

He takes a while to respond and says he doesn’t know how I could be confused and lists all of these things that I had done that bothered him. Most of them had to do with male friends I had…. So I say, “listen I’m not seeing anyone else, I like you, why don’t you just talk to me about things that are bothering you?” And he gets really argumentative. Which was pretty unlike him. Something just felt off. So the next day, I was like do you wanna get a drink?

I figured we should just talk about it. So we did and it was fine and we talked a little about it and things seemed better. Two days later he ghosted me.

It hurt my feelings but I was done trying so i moved on. About a month later I learned he was dating someone else I know….. the guy and I share a lot of contacts and mutual friends so I was confused why he would handle it like this. He dated the other girl for a few months and I guess it didn’t work out.

This is where it gets weird— Maybe 8 months later he and I happened to in the same room at a work event. I didn’t have ANY desire to talk to him after being treated like that. He had tried to come up to me at one point and I just walked past him. 

Then a month later he and I happen to me in the same room AGAIN. I catch him straight up staring at me. I again just ignore it. Later in the night he tries to come up to me and hit on me. I don’t let him talk to me — I just say I’m good and walk away end up leaving the event. He texts me and asks me where i went. I ignore it.

I text him a few days later telling him why I acted that way….. and tell him that he really hurt me and was confused why he would come and try and talk to me. He said he was sorry and had no idea he hurt my feelings he just thought we faded out…….

First of all, if a guy was open about being a virgin at the ripe age of 36, would this be a red flag for you, or still consider him?  


Also would you considering swiping right (or whatever the app does) on a trucker, even if he has full control over his schedual and can be home pretty much whenever he wants?  


What about being honest about living isutation? at 36 years old living at home with parents, simply because It does not seem financially smart to pay a mortgage / rent on a home if theres no reason to. Since Im an OTR Trucker, I only come home once every so often, sometimes weeks or months at a time. Only because I have no family, no kids or a wife to be with. If I did that would clearly change.

I was never encouraged towards intimacy and every attempt to express myself always felt condemned.
I have tried many dating apps literally for 10 years, to no avail. 
I’m petrified of trying to talk to women with any intent on dating because nothing has every worked out.
I’ve only hade sex twice, once only with two different women. Both of whom drifted away and ghosted. 
People tell me all the time I’m a good person and nice but feel like that’s always a lie. Because in spite of hearing good reviews on my character, I feel like I’m clearly the problem and that spirals into feeling incapable of loving and being loved.
I’m way beyond desperation and feeling worthless. 
I don’t know what to do, and despite being aware that it’s not as bad as it feels, I feel helpless and like a failed human. And super sad. All the time.

65,r8ach5,1638569610,Have I been friendzoned?,"Have I been friend zoned? 

I have been seeing this guy for over a month now, initially I’m the one who manifested the need to take things slow as he is a friend of a friend and I’m trying to prevent past situations I’ve been in - getting involved with people who didn’t want more and also trying to manage my anxiety.

He’s very clear, very opened minded and aware. 

We went on five “dates” so far, spending long periods of time together, some of them were with friends. 

Our relationship has been intense - just the way we discuss things, the kind of conversation we get into, he goes quite in depth, he asks a lot of questions about me and genuinely seems interested in getting to know me. He’s intense, I’m intense in the way I express my emotions and I also have an anxious attachment style, which is why I wanted to take things slow.

We talked about what love means to us, what relationships mean to us (romantic, friendly, familial…). That night he asked me if I only have sex with people I’m in a relationship, I was honest and but I did tell him I can’t have sex without feelings, or just for the sake of having it. He was very honest about his once very active sex life, and also mentioned that he was bi (70% women &amp; 30% men - only carnal experiences with men and that he only has relationships with women). We discussed some of our past relationships, and we seemed to be in sync. He asked me what I wanted ultimately, and I told him I wanted love. We did it that night, me being under the impression that we were on the same wavelength.

A few days after we met with friends, we went out and I ended up sleeping at his again. The next day he told me he was very thoughtful, in his own head and started saying that the relation was rather intense rather quickly. That he thought some relationship label was looming over our heads and that he wasn’t ready for that. He said as we were dating or seeing each other I would evidently expect that from him, especially that some of our conversations were centred around my insecurities and the emotions that this situation awakes in me.

He told me that he had a relationship ending a few months ago where they were planning to get married in 2 years, have babies in 3 and that he wasn’t ready right now for anything serious. That he didn’t want to foresee the future and for either of us to have a hidden agenda on the outcome, that he wanted to manage expectations. He also said he fell in love easily, and he could bring up in people the envy to settle down and he sensed that’s what I expected from him. I told him I was still talking and seeing other people so I guess that reassured him that I wasn’t ready either. 

I mentioned him I didn’t enjoy my wings been clipped, that I couldn’t be led into a cul de sac, that I couldn’t help not wanting to split my energy towards more than one person because it wasn’t natural to me but that I had to do that to manage my own expectations. He was saying that’s not what he was doing, and to not do anything that’s not natural to our personality - but rather not feeling ready to commit right now, that he wanted to take his time - taking it a day at a time. 

I was also wondering if he wanted to enjoy his sexual freedom again, given that he was in a serious relationship - having found his freedom again would allow him to freely have sex with both men &amp; women.

He proceeded to tell me that he did want to get to know me, spend time together, read what I write, keep going out and having fun together &amp; that he sensed I was fragile and he felt the need to take care of me. 

I left the conversation a bit puzzled because he’s the one who initiates most of the intimate and vulnerable topics, so I didn’t understand why it overwhelmed him so much at the time. He also said he wanted to adapt a “free love” kind of thing.

Linking it back to his recent experience, I could understand why he wouldn’t be keen to plan the future.

I told him I’d have to think about what he said because it wasn’t really clear to me what we were doing, so I told him again that I couldn’t be in a situation where things didn’t evolve and that my ultimate goal didn’t change either, but that I’d need to pick his brain about what he said. (That was around a week ago).

That morning we had foreplay but not full on sex (not because I didn’t want to but he stopped us)

We went for a drink a few days ago, and we carried on the previous conversation. I asked him to explain the notion of free love and what he meant by the things he said. He went on to explain that he wanted us to take it slowly and to keep this light and fun, keep dating and meeting, focus on building a strong base, a friendship that could amount to a relationship when we revisit the terms, but that he couldn’t sign up for anything right now as relationships consume him. I can sense that &amp; I was also okay with that. 

He also said that he wanted to make it less frustrating for me - (we had a conversation on the phone in the beginning as I was quite triggered, he cancelled a date and the communication died down, so we called to clarify the situation and he told me he was a really bad texter (but he communicates really well in real). I’m trying to tame my insecurities/ anxiety and my general opinion on communication with people I/ we date - I don’t want to gage his interest through that and we have had a conversation about texting styles, where he told me his level of interest doesn’t equate the volume of his messages. 

During that convo he had said that he’s trying to understand how his behaviour can hurt my feelings, and that he was trying to be conscious of that to prevent the behaviours that trigger me (without changing who he is), without necessarily changing who he is. He also works A LOT, and we talk about that often and I understand that, partly why he won’t embark in something serious, he barely has any time and he’s a very social being.

Back to the drinks, I shared with him that I can get anxious but that’s stems from past traumas and it might be a reflexion on his behaviour but the majority would be my attachment style, that if he did sensed frustration in me to not take it personally entirely as I’m trying to work on that. I’m a bad texter myself but when it comes to men I date, I get so frustrated. 

I told him that being given heads up would be nice. He told me he wanted me to help him, help me - and I do enjoy that in him.

That things aren’t binary and this isn’t so black or white - we then went for dinner together he paid for and then he walked me to the train station. We were supposed to meet at a friend’s event the next day but work got in his way, and he also mentioned finding the time to go watch a movie (hasn’t scheduled it yet).

We kissed and hugged goodbye, quite tightly and that was that.

Now I’m wondering if I’ve been friend zoned nicely or if I’m in a FWB situation (minus the sex, as I’m removing that out of the equation to protect my feelings and I know he’s not here for that, he said a few times that wasn’t the end goal, when I didn’t want us to have sex)

I need some opinions, because he’s so honest that I think he would have been clear on us not seeing each other anymore in that way - but it’s hard to rely on my judgment given my track record with men. 85% of me believes he is sincere in his intention, but my bestie told me I’ve been friend zoned - she’s very black or white so I need hardcore opinions that aren’t her’s.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r8ach5/have_i_been_friendzoned/

But that seems nearly impossible, because it looks like these ladies expect the girlfriend experience before they earn the title! Honestly I find it ridiculous!

I went on about 3 dates with this girl I met on tinder and well she was great company in person. But over text, she was insufferable. She showed no interest in me, nor did she show any value in me as a human being! From my perspective, she saw me as a wallet or a good time for her Instagram highlights.

I expressed a few of my concerns to her because I felt she was unappreciative towards my efforts, because not once did I hear a thank you. She became a little bit nicer, and sad to say I fell victim to that. 

We met up for a another date, where she invites her cousin and two of her friends. I found myself paying for her and her friends' drinks and food. And after the entire date I felt unappreciated again!

I don't think it's fair at all that I must be expected to prove myself to this degree just to get a date. Perhaps it's karma for my conduct during my past relationships or attempts at a relationship. 

However in all honesty, I don't think no human being deserves this type of treatment. I feel like shit. I feel like a chump. It truly isn't fair.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r8aef8/i_hate_dating_in_my_twenties_as_a_man/

I agreed and later on a girl (P2) was put in our group since she didn't have a partner. We all became good friends and later threw the idea of all of us going to the gym at 6 in the morning. We all agreed and when the day came, P1 did not wake up and so it was just P2 and I.

I told my girlfriend later on about my day and how P1 decided to sleep in and how it was just P2 and I. She didn't like that I had gone to the gym with a girl and became mad and upset.

so about 6 weeks ago (6 weeks into dating) i did bring up exclusivity and she sort of changed the topic, so i took that as she wasnt ready (or yeah im a backup) so i just said ""well im not dating around anymore"" and left it at that. i've not brought up exclusivity since.

so my question basically is, do i risk bringing up exclusivity again?

I used to read about the height thing in America on internet but I used to think incels used to blow it out of proportion. Now that I'm here... honestly, not inaccurate.

I'm 190 cm, which is 6'3"" in America. Back in Norway, taller than them was the overwhelming preference, but most would say &gt;25 cm is too tall as they'll feel like a child, but neither would necessarily be a dealbreaker. Height wasn't seen as a super attractive trait in an individual man, so my height did little for me (though I concede I am not very tall exactly).

Here is a completely different story. It's ""the taller the better"" or ""nothing too tall"". You constantly get hounded by the 6-foot thing. I have the habit of converting everything to cm, so 183 cm always feels like such an arbitrary number to my ears. Each and every woman, without fail, has an obsequious preference for tall men.

I was at the engagement party of an office colleague at the October, this year. Mostly single men and women between 25-35. The whole height thing came up and the women, 14 of them, were asked for their ideal height in a guy. The shortest digit was 6'2"" and the tallest 6'10"", with only one saying that below 6 feet was not a dealbreaker. We were mostly laughing then since we were drunk, but thinking back onto it, now, it genuinely seems crazy.

Norway has a few women who say things like ""175+/180+ more or don't bother"" or ""have to be 5 cm taller"" but these are far and few compared to dating apps here.

Is there any particular reason as to this? Are people here brought in a certain way which causes this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r8axtd/why_is_height_so_important_in_nyc/

One time a baby sitter let her go probably because she wasn’t showing up all the time. It’s try she got sick but she should be understanding and move on. She ruined that girls car with her keys after that girl closed the door on her. How she didn’t get charges pressed on her I don’t know. She even told me about it like she was proud. She is ruining my brothers life. He is angry &amp; miserable he doesn’t have his own space ever! She live with us rent free and doesn’t help out. My parents are too lazy to do something about it. My brother thinks her actions or normal because that’s how our parents raised us. I want to help him I just don’t know how. I’m scared because if he breaks up with her idk how she would act to him and our family.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r8bjv6/my_brother_deserves_better/

Before that, I met my old crush at 16 when we were both freshmen. I never pursued a relationship with her because I did my own thing and became focused on pursuing my education by the time I was a senior, still single and never dated anyone else since she left. At 22, I reconnected with her via Facebook, she asked me out, but I didn't have a car or driver's license. By reconnecting with her, she wanted to see if the feelings are still there, but it didn't work out. After I graduated high school, I enrolled in college and as usual, I'm still pursuing my education for a career and not a relationship, so I stopped talking to her. As of right now, I'm still not dating anybody until I figure out who I am and what I want in a relationship",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r8bpa8/i_just_turned_32_yesterday_and_i_realized_that_i/

It was uploaded to social media. Immediately, another male friend of mine asked in an angry curious tone who I was with. Later that night he sent a photo of himself and some other girl at the bar. She looked like some random girl he just wanted to include in the pic.

This is the same guy that NEVER mentions other women in front of me. I know nothing about his dating life. Meanwhile he has no problems asking me about my dates, telling me not to use Tinder, asking if I have a boyfriend and so on.

Is he jealous? Why is he trying to make me jealous? Why this behavior?

I obviously can’t tell him this because it would absolutely shatter him. We’ve tried multiple positions, toys etc but with what he’s equipped with it just doesn’t seem possible to give me what I feel I’m missing. Am I alone here? Do other women experience this?

88,r8c0j6,1638574386,How do I ask her out now? I don't know if I'll ever see her again.,"I'm a student at a very large university. This semester, I took an MIS 301 course. Since enrolling in the course, I got a major crush on the TA for the class. *She's one year older than me.* I talked with her after almost every class, and I went to her office hours to chat. 

Turns out, we have a ton in common: she's from my neighboring city, I drove past her high school almost every day, she's the same major as me, she did marching band, she was a drum major, she's interested in enlightenment philosophy, her favorite book is Crime and Punishment, she did debate in high school, my dad works in the field she's interested in, she loves data science, she's a coffee addict, and we literally played in a band together a few years ago without knowing it. 

Toward the end of the semester, I started getting vibes that she liked me too. She made jokes about professors flirting with their male students, said that I should join an org she's in to stay in contact, smiled at me whenever I was talking, historically laughed at terrible jokes, sent me a message saying how much she enjoyed some of my writing for the class, etc. 

As I was leaving class yesterday, she said, ""I hope you have a great break, \*insert my name\*."" I was the only student she said anything to in a class of 50 or so. I also said that I would miss the professor, and I heard her audibly say ""Aww"" from the other side of the room. 

I had a plan to ask her out yesterday--which was our last class to avoid breaking university policy--but she left right after to grade exams walking out with the male professor and another male TA. I didn't want to embarrass her in front of them, so I decided to wait for an hour for her to come back to the classroom where I thought she left her stuff. Turns out, it was someone else's stuff, and she left. 

I don't have her number; all I have is her email. Would it be okay to email her to ask if we could meet somewhere to talk about something? I'm a novice when it comes to dating. Is there a better way to ask her out? I'm done with my finals, and this potential romance is the only thing keeping me from going back to my hometown.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r8c0j6/how_do_i_ask_her_out_now_i_dont_know_if_ill_ever/

98,r8cr4k,1638576617,Am I reading too much into his response?,"The guy (30M) and I (27,F) have been on 2 dates.Both flowing conversations, physical attraction on both ends, really good positive energy etc we have gotten along. Before our dates we flirted virtually and things flowed. On date 2 two weeks ago we had lots of fun, slept together. He told me he was looking forward to seeing me soon again and I told him me too but that sadly  it would be about 3 weeks before that because I'll be studying and testing for finals (I'm in a rigorousb1 semester pre-med program, have to study tons of material and test every 4 weeks) . He said that was totally ok and if anything he is in a busy involving career too. 

Anyway, we were talking through Instagram just touching base in a conversation. He asked when I would be free again and I clarified. I then asked him cheekily ""Do you miss me?"". He responded 3 hours later despite being online "" who are you again?"" 

I actually am hurt because before this we had been flirting and he seemed romantic. I grew to like him after years of flirting and him being adamant to still meet up when we finally could.

I'm a bit confused about where exactly he lost interest but I know it doesn't matter. I'm wondering if I have a right to feel this way or if I'm reading into it. Truth be told I do have a Fearful Avoidant style and tend to be ""one foot in one foot out "" and this is making me step completely out and just walk away from the connection. I just hope I'm not misjudging him because he does have a ""roasting like"" sense of humor even with me (which I've told him I don't like) 

I also don't want to disregard my instincts and be into someone who is clearly not anymore. Is it advisable for me to just cool things off with this guy preemptively? I'm totally ok being friends with him if things don't work out.

I feel so stupid now and have difficulty falling asleep… I know I should have been firmer in my boundaries and don’t understand why I let this happen. I feel so sad now and a bit anxious.. What can I do to feel better again?
