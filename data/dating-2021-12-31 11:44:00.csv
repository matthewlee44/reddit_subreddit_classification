For example, I tried sending the first like and initiating conversations. Whenever I initiate though, the guy doesn’t “match my energy”, replies like he’s too-cool-for-school (even if he clicked like on me first lol), then kinda slow fades out altogether. But when I let the guy initiate, those are the conversations that keep going and, most often, lead to a date.

Another example, I’ve heard men here complain about women not complimenting them enough. So when I actually try giving a genuine compliment more often, it’s met with unenthusiastic reply, no compliment back, etc. Over a simple compliment too (about their style, music taste, smile, etc.) Does it look like I’m trying too hard?

Another example, sending any message other than “hey” typically looks like I’m trying too hard, and is usually met with unenthusiastic reply. 

But I noticed that when I do the BARE minimum, like just sending “hey”, replying super slowly, waiting for guy to initiate, etc I get a lot more interest. So which one is it? Be typical and “too cool for school” or be authentic and open?

39,rt2qlo,1640983150,Questioning my [24M] love for my girlfriend [25F] after the former girl of my dreams that I never pursued anything with [22F] suddenly confessed wanting to pursue a serious relationship with me; I need help understanding what to do," I \[24M\] met my girlfriend \[25F\], let’s call her Stacy, a four months ago and we became official two months ago. I really like Stacy a lot, think we are very compatible, that she’s good for me, and I care for her a ton. I first told her I loved her a month ago, because I felt so strongly about her (and she said it back). This is my first actual relationship and first time telling someone I love them. Things are really great, though I wish I could see her a little more often in the week.

Shortly after I told Stacy I loved her, we had our first fight bc she found flirty texts of mine with other girls (no I did not intend on pursuing anything with them) that had been exchanged between the time we became official and I said I Love You. Stacy was hurt, I felt terrible, made it up to her, and promised her and myself this would never happen again. I loved her too much to mess around like this (I think I had sent those texts as I was used to being single and maybe freaked at the idea of exclusivity and needed a fantasy outlet). I’ve stuck to my word since, ignored any girls hitting me up, and our relationship has been stronger than ever.

However, yesterday out of the blue this one girl \[22F\] that I met/hung with only once 3 years ago, and thought she was absolutely gorgeous and a really good match for a long term partner at the time, reached out over text. Let’s call her Jen. While I’d never told Jen what I thought of her, I had often fantasized about being with her over the years but couldn’t see her since that first meet bc we’ve lived in different countries since. I’d told Jen in the past I may be visiting where she lives/our home country but haven’t been able to due to various reasons (visa, covid, etc.). I had last texted with Jen a few months ago before I ever became official with Stacy.

Anyway, I gave in and responded to Jen’s text and kept it platonic, when she suddenly makes it a little flirty, for the first time ever, which I went along with unfortunately. Then she asks if she can call me, I say yes, and in a nutshell: she tells me that she would really like to date me with the intention of marriage down the line, assuming we click (in our culture/where she lives, dating is often done with the intention of marriage). Shockingly she really had liked me just as much as I had liked her when we met and had been thinking about me more recently hence the hit-up. We called for 3 hrs learning more about each other and discussing the potential of a future between us; I did not mention that I currently already have a gf.

Jen is even down to start a long distance thing right now if I’m down (again, common where are from) bc I told her we should meet in person to see if we really wanna pursue each other before committing to anything but we both know that’s not gonna happen soon. If we were to commit via an LDR/over text and calls though, then Jen could make a case to her family to come out and see me soonish. However, I personally would like to build a foundation in-person with anyone before committing to anything especially if marriage is the end-goal. She agreed with me.

Now, I feel that I’ve basically just bought myself time to see how things go with Stacy and re-assess whether I actually do love her, given I found myself engaging in this sort of shit. I really thought Stacy and I were headed a pretty serious route, and even she is envisioning marriage, though we haven’t discussed it explicitly at all.

I feel like an unfaithful asshole leading them both on, not knowing what the hell I want, and just being selfish trying to keep both options open. Does this mean I don’t actually love Stacy? Am I just not meant for monogamy? Do I have a mental or personality disorder? Please help me with your view of the situation and how best to navigate. Note that both girls are great in their own right, though I think from my family’s perspective Jen would be a better long term option (yes families do get involved in our culture). Is it worth ending it with Stacy who I know well and have established love and chemistry with, simply for giving it a shot with Jen who seems very promising but obv I don’t know her 100% like I do Stacy. I would love your input here.

**—TLDR—**

**TLDR;** I’m in a relatively new relationship with a great girl that I love, that “checks all the boxes”, and think we are headed quite a serious route. Suddenly, another girl, who I only know a little but have previously fantasized a lot about being with but couldn’t due living so far apart, reaches out saying she’s super interested in pursuing something serious with me even if it means starting off as a long distance at first, which was surreal, something out of a dream.

40,rt2z3s,1640983870,Anybody in their 20s unsure of what they want with their relationships/dating in general?,"I'm a 25 M. Ever since I've started dating (I've had one LTR that lasted 3 years, a couple of FWBs and some minor ""one-to-two casual dates""). In each of my situations, I've been infatuated witht the prospect of having a LTR. But whenever things get serious, I tend to back off and lose all interest (I've been in therapy to fix my avoidant-insecure attachment style, I know that 90% of my reluctance and fear is because of this and I've made great progress).

However, I've noticed I've recently lost interest in dating in general. Like, I would love to have a person to talk with everyday, cuddle, have sex with and share things with. I met my first GF when I was 21, and I felt *so* unready for the seriousness of the relationship. I was just getting my feet wet in dating (I had lost my virginity the same year to a different girl). Anyway, things got serious pretty quickly - this girl had her entire lifetime planned out mentally. She was to get her first kid when she was 28, get married around the same time and settle down early. For me, the whole prospect of settling down and getting ready for this made me so unsure of the whole thing. This led to us breaking up after a couple of years of dating, because I was so unsure if this was the life I wanted to live. Don't get me wrong, I really cared for this girl (and to a certain extent do today aswell and miss her dearly, even though we didn't want the same thing).

But it's like.. I see some of my friends entering LTRs, getting married, having kids, buying homes, cars etc. And I just can't feel that this is what I want in life, to settle for that road. At the same time, I don't want to end up single and alone for the rest of my life either. It's just that I'm so unsure on the whole ""settle down with one person for the rest of your life""-thing. Are all relationships supposed to lead to marriage? How do I take this pressure of myself and just enjoy the relationship for what it is?

Does anybody feel the same way, that they are unsure of what the whole goal of dating another person is in the long term? Is this something that will probably change when I approach my 30s and my goals/perspective in life changes?

Honestly I'm fine by myself, mostly. I have many hobbies, friends who care about me, a good social life and there are things in life that fulfill me. But having that special someone would still be nice, after a certain time.

I must say, I've rarely met anybody in their early 20s who are ready to settle down and commit 100%. It just seems so crazy to me, haha..",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rt2z3s/anybody_in_their_20s_unsure_of_what_they_want/
41,rt32i4,1640984150,I think my gf has an unhealthy obsessive relationship with her dog. Family are telling me to run,"I met my gf on tinder, I already knew she loved dogs because in her bio it said “don’t swipe if you’re not a dog lover”, I still swiped on her because I do love dogs, I had a dog growing up who I loved so much. 

Me and my gf are both 23 if that matters, anyways we have been dating for about 5 months now, I really like her and I like being with her she’s a really caring and a passionate person but I do feel like she has a weird obsession or unhealthy obsessive relationship with her dog. She adopted this dog a month before she met me, the dog is about 1 years old now. 

•She had a birthday party for this dog at the dog park

•she lives in a two-bedroom apartment and uses the second bedroom for a “pink themed dog room”  which basically is a room with all the dog’s toys, play room area, portraits/pictures, not to mention that her dog has her own closet in this room filled with the dog’s clothes, shoes/boots, many different collars, bandanas, ETC. (her dog doesn’t even sleep in this room but she still gives this dog a whole room) 

•They share the same bed! I thought this was strange because she cuddles her dog and falls asleep like that. This dog sleeps with a pillow on its head lol. I don’t know it just looks very odd to me

I find it creepy that when I stay over her place, we sleep with the dog. The dog isn’t even on the foot of the bed, the dog’s head is where our heads are and the dog shares my girlfriends pillow with her. Her dog snores and it’s just annoying that her dogs face is just where our faces are. I’ve asked her to move the dog to the foot of the bed and she has, but the dog wakes up in the middle of the night and will put itself back on the pillow next to my gf

•most of the times when I ask her what she wants to do, it includes her dog. For example, we were getting bored of the things to do in our small town and I asked her what she would like to do, she will say things like “the dog park”, “the river walk” (which is basically a large open park where people bring their dogs and kids) or she will suggest dining at some bar/restaurant that allows outside dining so she can bring her dog 

•she will sometimes refuse plans if it requires us to leave her dog for more than 5 hours (says her dog has separation anxiety and she needs to take her potty every few hours)

•she has SO many clothes for her dog

•brushes her dogs teeth every single day, has all these dental products for her dog like dental mouth wash, two different toothpastes, dental treats, and dental flossing toys 

•she spends so much money on treats, clothes, and toys for this dog like everyday there’s a new package it seems like.

I also understand this is all her money and she is entitled to do whatever she wants with her money, it’s just kind of concerning! 

•this dog has it’s own Instagram account 

•on her photo album in her phone, I swear it’s only pictures of her dog, you’ll rarely find a pic that isn’t of her dog 

•she overly posts pictures of her dog on social media 

•she talks to her dog in a baby voice and carries her around like the dog is a small infant. (The dog is about 33 pounds and is a medium sized breed) 

•she literally kisses and hugs her dog and tells her how much she loves her every second 

•She has stated she likes her dog better than most people. She has made comments about how she values dogs more than babies. She finds babies annoying and dogs cute. (Which is fine, it is her opinion that she likes dogs more than babies but that was her explanation of why she values a dog’s life over a babies). Because of these remarks I am kind of scared since she seems like the person that would put her dog before anyone else. I’m actually terrified and concerned for her if something ever happens to this dog because I don’t think she can live without her. Everything just seems to revolve around this dog. 

I just found a lot of things that she does to be obsessive and just kind of weird. I guess I just need to know if this is normal behavior or not? I just don’t know how to address this with her without hurting her feelings also",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rt32i4/i_think_my_gf_has_an_unhealthy_obsessive/

When I first met this girl she was in a relationship with somebody, and they had been together for about 8 years (since she was 14 she is now 23). I told her that I liked her and that if we could get to know each other more and she said yes and told me she had just broken up with her ex 2 months ago. We talked for about 8 months and nothing really came from it except that we would talk on the phone everyday, text, and hang out frequently however we never had sex. She then confessed to me that this whole time she was still having sex with her ex but that she had stopped and now wants to take me serious. 
Things got a little more serious and she started coming over to my house and met my fam and what not. About two weeks after that she tells me she doesn’t know if she wants to keep talking to me and that she’s not sure if she’s done with her ex. So after arguing we decided to stop talking and that lasted for about 4 months.
I chose to hit her up after seeing her at a party. We talked on the phone and caught up with each other and kind of naturally started to talk again like we did before. She tells me that she still talks to her ex but that she doesn’t have feelings for him for sure and that she is eventually willing to stop talking to him.
From there things were good we talk on the phone every morning, night, and throughout the day. After hanging out a couple times she came over and we had sex. That same week we started to argue more than usual and now she says that we don’t always have to talk on the phone every morning and night.

I would ask to take her out and she would be busy, sometimes she would even show me proof why she was busy and tell me what she was doing. So she was free eventually and I took her out to watch spiderman. I had to meet her parents and I met her sister. The second she got in the car and we started talking I just got super nervous and anxious, I didnt really think much of it.

this is my second date ever, and im a virgin. She was talking a lot, she brought up most questions and I would answer them. She even talked about how her last 2 ex's cheated on her and how, and how she hasen't had a relationship in like 2 years, she just said a lot of personal shit involving her sister and stuff that I can't even say here. point being she was talking theee wholeee time about any little question I asked her about, I didn't have room to really start my own conversation.

I held her hand during the movie, then I dropped her off and she gave me a kiss on the cheek. I texted her about 4 hours after saying, It was really nice to meet you, I had a great time. She said it was nice to meet me too then yea that was it and we just started having normal convos again. Then I asked her why she doesn't send snaps of herself, when I do to her a lot. She says she just doesn't like it, then I say how your so pretty then she says I'm not even that pretty, then I say I your the prettiest girl I've met, then shes like you have been talking to some ugly asss girls then.

and I say ""I \*was talking to girls and I don't talk to girls like that"" then we keep talking and I say things like your the only girl I talk to, I give you all my attention. then she asks ""what about after the date? "" I say why would I talk to any girls, all I need is you"" then she ask ""what do you see happening to us"" I'm not gonna lie I think I said shit too soon but she just makes me so happy when we've been texting for a while and I know so much about her. I said "" I don't know depends where it goes, but I want you"" and then she said how I was quiet during the date, I didn't match the same energy she thought I had during texting and that she said I looked uncomfortable/ nervous around her and that I pulled out a vape lol, when she told me during the date that she brought a vape with her sister and she hits it with her friends. and I told her that I was nervous anxious, we had some convos and she just said she doesn't want a relationship right now, which is fine I don't understand how you can think I meant a relationship by saying I want you and 1 date. and I told her to give me a second change, It won't happen again it just a in the moment thing and she says ""you would really wanna hang out again?"" idk but that made it seem like she thought I didn't like her anymore or I was uncomfortable around her but I reassured that i wasnt. she just said she needs time to think about the date. after that, I just changed the subject and we have been talking everyday for over a week now since the date and she hasn't changed her texting, or response time or anything it's like nothing happened, which on my side is good but I just wanted to get your guys opinion.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rt54tf/nervous_and_anxious_first_date_help/

We recently ended things (Tuesday) and decided we should just be friends moving forward, even though I tried suggesting a break/time apart. He said maybe we can pick up in the future, but as of right now, he's just too angry, irritated and annoyed about me. The reason we ended things was I felt he wasn't communicating with me as much as he used to and was not prioritizing me for plans. Example was he had an off day from work and I planned to make him dinner as our plans for Monday were cancelled... he said he would let me know if that works because he might be having some friends over. I got annoyed and called him out on it, he in turn got more annoyed and told me I was being a psycho and acting like I was his wife. Now we're ""friends"" and talking as if nothing really happened between us and as if there was never a fight.

I'm torn between just sending her another message with my phone number telling her to text me if she wants or to just wait for her to respond on her normal schedule.

We kept talking mostly for the following months, because I got really busy due to my studies and so did she. We had really connected, we are both two socially akward and Introverters, loved to talk about politics, comics and random convos about anything. She is a very politically aware, smart and independent, which are things that I really like on a girl.

She has this thing that it never really bothered me, but because she has a low social battery, sometimes she will open a mesage and reply some time after, which is fine. Last time, she opened a message and it took her 3 days to answer it, and then she asked me to see her at library. But it has been about 4 days that she opened my message, I post a story on insta and she saw it, which means she is active.

76,rt7oh8,1640998385,[M18] I hate myself,"
My best ( and only friend, since we were 6 yo ) kept telling me about this girl he met. He’s always been a stunningly good looking guy, and so is the girl he told me about ( he showed me some pics ). They got together some weeks after, and he was enthusiastic. I was feeling pretty sad, honestly, but of course i was happy for him. 

It’s not an easy achievement ( I mean finding a gf/bf ). It’s nice to be happy for other people’s achievements… but i’d rather be happy for my own achievements too.

Our friendship started fading. He’s always been a very popular dude, and never really had any kind of trouble with girls. I feel like a ghost now. He’s the reason why I deleted my socials too. He kept posting pics with her, or just pics of himself. It’s not that i look bad ( I regularly go to the gym ), but he’s the main source of my insecurities, especially regarding girls and friends.

Considering I’m not even his friend anymore, I spent this year in total loneliness. This night has been the worst night of my life. Why can’t I be normal? Why can’t I be like my friend?

Having a gf looks like something unreachable honestly, and I hate myself for that. I hate my stutter, and I hate the way I look. I’ve been having suicidal thoughts for years, and i kind of feel like I’ll finally have the guts to do something, even if it will end it all. I’ve never been courageous enough to live.

I am a 24 year old woman, and yesterday I went on a date with a man that I matched with on bumble.

He has been texting me consistently since yesterday, and it is not giving me the space that I need to process how I feel about him.

He also asked me what he needs to improve on for the next date, and I don't know what to say without offending him. 

I tend to get overwhelmed easily and I need my own space to think. I also like doing my own thing without having to check in with someone all the time, especially someone who I just met yesterday.

But back to my main point, they don’t think it should matter. But if a guy asks, they usually either not say or lie. But if they thought there was nothing wrong with having a high body count, they’d tell the truth right?

And if he has a problem with it, she could just leave him. Or even if she felt the need to lie because she thought he’d judge her, why would she not then just leave him?

Long time lurker and this will only my second post, so I apologize if my lack of experience comes through. First, its NYE and I want to wish everyone a hopefully good day full of the things you all love and enjoy, and if it’s a painful day, that you aren’t alone and have my thoughts.

Now onto why I am here. I (37f) just went through a breakup with my partner (32m) of 2 years. I have come to realize that he had grown resentful of me to the point that the things I would say that would be perceived to him as me saying he wasn’t good enough or that I didn’t like him and that I wanted him to change. In the end, he felt like he couldn’t provide me with what I needed (his words, not mind), and it was tearing him apart and he felt tired of that feeling and needed space. While we had our issues, his decision to end it really came as a surprise to me. We had gone through a lot in the past two years, and I felt that we were committed to work through whatever issues lay ahead, as we had before. While two years isn’t a terribly long time for me and in general, this relationship was extremely meaningful to me. It was different than any of the others I had experienced. And to be completely honest, I really thought he was the one. 

With that said, the new year is just around the corner. I was supposed to come visit him but instead, am now by myself to ring it in. I am still going through a lot of emotions and dealing with some resentment and anger. My current state of thoughts revolve around how I could still have been with my family (they are far from me, and I just came back from seeing them so I could go visit my ex) while also feeling sad and completely heartbroken to have loss someone that I have spent the majority of my time with for the past two years (due to pandemic and closed circles). I am feeling alone and lonely in my current town. 

But while I feel those feelings, I still want to focus on healing, trying to understand what I can of what happened, and gain some different perspectives so I can grow from that. I know I can’t understand it all, but I’m hoping to hear some stories of others who may have been in a similar situation. I hope that may give me insights into what I could have done differently, if anything, and provide me with a new way to look at things. Thus, the purpose of me sharing the following is to seek perspective or advice of those who have been through something similar, and especially those who have or are dating something with untreated depression/anxiety and substance use. I would love to hear experiences from both sides.

Some context about my dating history and background: 

In the past, I tended to date whoever showed interest in dating me as opposed to actively seeking what I think I want. I have had some very abusive and toxic relationships in the past, but also healthy ones. Additionally, when I decide to commit to a person, I easily begin to care about them as I would care about my own family or friends, adopting their goals as part of my own. I’ve been told (from family and past loves who I am still friends with) that I give great support while also walking the fine line of not enabling and am good at cheering people on to help them achieve their own life goal that lie outside my own. I am highly independent but am never too afraid to ask for help (or at least see it as a bad sign if I am afraid to do so) and am blessed with a great support system of family and friends. My general philosophy is that I don’t believe any one person can give you all your needs, that we should strive to feel fulfilled on our own, and that romance and friends should add to my life if that is what I desire. 

I also believe that we all carry our own past experiences that shape how we communicate and perceive. Further, I am sensitive that many of us have physical or mental health issues that can take a lifetime to work through. However, we all deserve love and care as we progress through life and the trick is to find what differences are compatible. I am also highly empathetic and non-judgmental while able to hold my own stances and opinions.  At the worse, my traits or behaviors have led me to stick in bad and toxic relationships for a long time and it wasn’t until the past couple of years that I learned more about what boundaries were and started to implement them. I also have a background in mental health so in the past (and possibly present), I conflated any knowledge and understanding how someone could feel and act a certain way with what I should personally accept as behavior towards myself. My traits, along with my lack of boundaries led me to emotionally burn out in 2019, as I gave so much of myself while asking very little back under the guise that I understood, loved, and so long as I believed the good intentions of someone, I’d be there to support them. I admit that sometimes the line of “this is too much for me” can be blurred once I deeply love, leaving me to possibly accept “breadcrumbs” if I am with someone who always seem to have challenges greater than mine. I often have the narrative that everyone goes through hard things in life, timing can be a pain of when we come into each other’s lives, but we all still deserve love, care, and support - I can patiently step aside my own non-urgent needs and give someone the support and space to grow, try out new things, be there when it may “fail” and love them and watch them grow. I also see a therapist and while I am still recovering from the emotional burnout that led to my first major depressive episode, I am much better now than I was two years ago.

If you have read this far, thank you! But I have yet to get to the actual relationship recap…

My partner and I met right before the pandemic hit. Because of this, most of our time getting to know each other was constrained by the pandemic. Over the course of the past two years, we saw each other for a weekend about every two to three weeks so this was a much slower pace of getting to know someone than I was used to. I’m providing this context because I believe our frequency of seeing each other contributed to how long it took for me to realize some things. Additionally, he is severely allergic to my cat (though he still loves them). It was a “quirk” we accepted as I was ok to always be the one to go to his place. Thus, getting to know each other happened at a slow rate, and usually under the same context (being at his place). Additionally, because this pandemic occurred, it was hard to assess whether the challenges we would face were “rare and unique” to the pandemic over what it could be like under otherwise normal circumstances. Thus, while I am grateful that the pandemic provided a unique opportunity to learn how each of us handled uncertainty and messy life things, I often wondered, if it made it unnecessarily hard at the beginning as we were getting to know each other. 

On the (slow) realization that there is something deeper going on:

The first time I came over to his place, I learned that our daily life surroundings were strikingly different (his room was a mess, he didn’t really have any cook wear and thus never cooked or have things to store food in, didn’t really furnish the place so there was no place to eat or relax other than the bedroom). I honestly didn’t think anything of it. To me, people are different and enjoy different things and being a late bloomer in some areas of my own life (and having friends and a sibling who are also late bloomers in various way) I didn’t see this as any sort of flag or cautionary thing. And even though I did feel like I was going to a dorm room every time I came over (packing my spices and cook wear so we could eat during the pandemic for example), I didn’t hold any of this against him or make any judgments from that about his character. It wouldn’t be until later on that I would see this as a part of a recurring larger pattern of lack of self-care, manifested from underlying issues which grew my concerns.

After he left his job, he eventually was able to find another one using a prior work connection. This was now during the midst of the pandemic in early 2020. This job was a work from home job and for him, this was terribly difficult. He realized that he couldn’t be productive at home and believed that he was one who needed to go to an office to be productive. I get that and being someone who has had to carry work from home, I tried my best to provide some tips or tricks that could help (creating a separate workspace, boundaries, etc). As time moved on, it became obvious that he was really struggling with motivating for work. It was also around this time when he started having days of withdrawing from me (via texting) and when I would reach out and check in, he began revealing that he was experiencing really bad depression. Hearing this, I tried to think of all the ways I could offer support and help. I knew that this was a good working opportunity for him in the moment, as it was remote during the pandemic, and also his boss was very understanding of who he was and his need for flexibility because of his history of having on and off days (he has Lyme and there are still some things, I believe, that influence how well he can feel on certain days). I didn’t want him to lose this job and knew that if nothing changed, that it was a possibility. I offered to help him rearrange some things at his place, use/borrow my furniture so he could have a table, figure out whatever was needed so that he could set up a separate workspace…whatever I thought could help based off my own experience of working from home but also what he said he may want. However, I am never one to force (and again, my history keeps me of reminding myself that my general rule is to try to not put more energy into something for someone else that they are not putting energy into) but did keep reminding that I am more than happy to help when he was ready for me to. Unfortunately, this offer was never taken and eventually he loss his job. 

Over the course of the next few months as well as retrospectively looking back, I began to notice more of how a lot of his behaviors indicate undiagnosed/untreated depression. He didn’t care for his surroundings, he never seemed too excited about things, he lacked motivation for basic life things, tasks like checking the mail was too much, etc. Along with this, while I knew he smoked week recreationally, I noticed that his use (or at least what I was around to see his use) went from after work (most likely every night) to all day, every day. I rarely saw him sober. I also know that a lot of choices and decisions are invisibly shaped by use (and how we manage mental/physical health. I started to wonder which of my current partner’s behaviors (forgetting some convos or things he would say, his need to have me leave his place after some time, not wanting to pick me up at certain times since he wants to be sober while driving, moodiness, etc) were being shaped by this. However, in these earlier moments, I just took things visit by visit. After all, it is only weed, is what I would tell myself. And additionally, things are hard in life (pandemic) and with the lack of a job and too much time, someone’s use could easily increase. As someone who happens to have highly non-addictive tendencies, I didn’t see it as a major problem (I know) until I knew he couldn’t stop even if he wanted to. I tried my best to navigate his behavior and anticipate his needs (he often didn’t know or want to think about what would make him feel better. Additionally, it was a learning curve for me to understand or figure out what things made him more anxious rather than helped. For example, I learned about how we handled hard situations differently. I tend to be someone who seeks out information in order try to prevent or maintain safety. I would keep up to date about the virus, learn things from how to appropriately wash hands to reading articles of how we believe the virus transmitted (remember how most of us were scrubbing our groceries?!). Further, my vigilance also came from my partner being more high risk so I wanted to do everything I could to make sure we could remain safe when we saw each other. He, on the other hand, wants to completely avoid the news and shut it all out. This revelation came when I went to call him (learned that that was a no-no as he hates phone calls) to inform him that grocery stores may be shutting down soon so he should try to get what he needs. This was the first time I experienced him being upset at me for giving him information and I felt awful. Thus, one of the first challenges I had to navigate was trying to figure out how I could keep myself feeling safe as I knew he didn’t keep up with any pandemic information (does he know we should have circulated air? Be wearing masks inside and out? Be socially distancing?) while respecting his boundary of not discussing or bringing up pandemic news. Another example was that when he was feeling down and we hadn’t seen each other in a month, I mailed him what I thought was a cute letter letting him know I loved him and that things will be ok but learned that it made him anxious to get the mail). I think he resented that he felt he had to get the mail which of course, made me feel bad because the purpose was to have him feel better and loved. I’m sure there are many other instances where I thought I was providing space, love, and care, but was doing the opposite. 

It would take me over the course of the next several months to really put a name on the behaviors I was seeing and discovering that mental health and substance use was part of what was going on. I knew he needed support, but I didn’t really see the big overall picture of why. I also believe this was slow to realize because we tend to have similar preferences (homebodies, inherently lazy, both like watching movies and shows and playing video games, and i also don’t have anything against weed on its own). At the earlier moments, I would see his behaviors as him having some hard days and would try to give him what he needed. It wasn’t until much later and looking back, that I saw the larger pattern of self-medicating unmanaged depression and anxiety, using that as his main coping mechanism, in hand with isolating and escaping through movies and video games. I didn’t realize that this was a potential driver of some choices he made (like when he could come get me because he didn’t want to drive while high). I saw that nearly every aspect of life was becoming very overwhelming for him. In terms of our relationship, I would often try to check in and make sure that he still wanted the same things I wanted (marriage, kids, me haha) and he assured me he did, and I really believed this. Once I realized what was happening, I slowly, when I felt appropriate, began to use these words in our dialogue, telling him I cared a lot about him but that I believe he should seek therapy or help to manage his depression and anxiety and substance use. He eventually talked to a doctor who prescribed him some anti-depressants. Though he wasn’t interested in maintaining that relationship (or one with a therapist), I tried to understand that that was a good first step and not everyone is in a place to face these challenges. In the meantime, I tried to show support in other ways by listening or being there for him. When he needed space, I gave it to him, even if that meant going another week or two without seeing him. When he got frustrated or angry, I stepped aside and tried to not let it eat at me personally and gave us space. When our first Christmas came around, his family asked me for tips of what to get him, and I gave suggestions that I hoped would help him feel happier about his surrounding space (basic cookware, furniture, patio set so we could chill out on his lovely porch!). 

Eventually, this wasn’t enough. He never found work and eventually, I was hit with news that he would have to move back home which was quite far from where we currently were. Selfishly this devastated me. He was the one person I saw during the pandemic and the thought of someone who was such a large part of a crazy period of life disappearing was quite scary. We decided to try long distance and I began to view that this was the right choice for hm. He would be close to family who can provide him care and support and room to breathe. 

His move was extremely distressful to both of us. We went through the painful process of counting down the time until he left. I helped him pack when he didn’t have the capacity or energy, and we reassured each other that if we could get through a pandemic, we could get through this. He assured me that he still saw me as someone he wanted to grow a family with and be with for a long time. I really believed that I was learning how to navigate extremely difficult challenges in tandem with someone, giving space and support while also protecting myself. Our general hopes was that we could both look at this time where we had to be apart as a chance for him to get some breathing room and space to get back on his feet and for me to keep working on my own career goals - so while it is hard now, that it will be worth it in the long run. Fast forward to a couple of days ago where I got back from traveling and we attempted a video call (I missed him and was excited to see him!). Anyways, we tried to maintain good spirits during the process and discussed how we can make it through with good communication and setting dates up and eventually we planned our first visit (over NYE) to see each other. 

Since he moved, he began becoming increasing frustrated with me. There were a few days where he wasn’t very talkative via text. After a couple of days of this, I reached out to see how he was doing and tried to state what I needed was for him to be present when we did chat (he was frequently missing what I was texting or didn’t read it correctly or would skip some parts) and that I need communication. He stated he hasn’t been as communicative because things have been overwhelming for him and that he also didn’t want to tell me that he spent all day smoking. I told him I understood that but that I would rather hear from him even if that is what he has been doing, after all, I love him, love hearing from him about the small and large things in life, and also there was no expectation that he would just stop smoking cold turkey and that things would magically change when he moved. At the same time, I knew that this whole process has been overwhelming for me too, and I was starting to really feel that the space for my needs were increasingly diminishing. The call didn’t last long as when he mentioned that he hoped to unpack boxes in his room, and I replied with “that would be nice!” which triggered him to be in a bad mood and feel as though I was judging him (this was not at all the case). But again, I believed we had learned how to better navigate these things by giving space and time and distance. I thought that that would be the groundwork that gave us a chance to work together for what may lie ahead. However, in the end, that wasn’t the case. This led to the next couple of days of tension and then resulted in him feeling anxious about me seeing him (he also mentioned traveling with the new surges happening) and cancelling the trip and us breaking up. This was also when I placed a name on the reactions as being feelings of resentment, which he then later believed was happening as well. Looking back, I wonder if it was also probably around the time when I started discussing him seeking treatment that my words of support and encouragement began coming off as me not liking who he is.

Now here I am. 

Despite the challenges we faced, I really did love our relationship, at least right now looking back. I loved the fact that \*when\* we did talk and communicate, we did so very honestly and directly. We eventually got to the point where we were very good about handling conflict and our induvial differences by saying we needed to stop and can return to an issue, allowing each other space to cool off, and also, we never tried to place blame or make situations be right or wrong. It was quite refreshing. I did also feel like he really listened to me, and even if he didn’t understand why I would feel how I did and would attempt to make changes or do small things that showed me that he cared about how I felt. I felt like I also returned this. Finally, I had the opportunity to practice my boundaries because I felt safe in doing so. While we are very different in many ways, I saw how many of these differences could be resolved through communication and willingness, something that I find important in a lasting partnership as conflict will always arise in new situations. I will always be forever grateful for that. 

I felt like I did everything I could to show support, provide help, and allow him the space he needed. In the end, I know that I can’t ever fix a person, but show them that they deserve love and self-care and that if they are ready and willing to tackle these issues that they themselves no longer want, I would be there. As his partner, it was painful to see this happen to him. I also knew I couldn’t fix anything. I did what I thought was my best in navigating this line — show my love and support through being there for him, giving him he space he needed when he didn’t want to be around anyone, providing help when he did need or want it. Now I am pondering on what I have done that may have caused someone to feel such resentment towards me. One day, I may be ready to move on, and it is most likely that I will probably meet others who have similar struggles and want to learn how to be supportive without causing resentment.

TLDR: I recently had a breakup with someone who has untreated depression and anxiety due to feelings of resentment. I am wondering what I could of done differently, if anything.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rt91k5/new_year_and_looking_to_learn_to_those_of_you_who/

Normally if I haven’t had sex with a girl by the third date I’d just consider it a lost cause but I really like this girl so I’ve been holding out, but since she hasn’t slept with me I’m getting the vibe she’s not interested in me sexually and is only in to me emotionally if that.

Dear Love,I've been looking for you, for some time. I thought I've found you on a few occasions, but I'm eventually shown I was mistaken. It wouldn't be so bad, but my heart keeps cracking. I hope it doesn't break before we meet.I keep finding those in your disguise, given false hope, half-truths, and outright lies. The fire has always burned hot, in a heart as big as mine. I think the flame has left, cinder and ash remain.I walk the line, hoping in time we find each other. The road of life moves forward unless you stop. Sometimes we need a rest, sometimes we take them because the road forward and backward looks the same. Unsure where to go.I thought we talked this year, for months, every day. It was all just a play, and my part was to be used. I dreamt of a future you helped put in my head. To be left with nothing...well less than nothing. For another piece of my heart went too.I held on too long, wishing you would wrap your arms around me. I let go, some time ago..moving on from somewhere I didn't belong. Lost and dreary, from a year that's made me weary. So I keep going, hoping my pain isn't showing.I want to meet you, but after 40 years...I don't know if I will...
