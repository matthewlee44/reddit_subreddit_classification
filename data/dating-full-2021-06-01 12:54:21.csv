We've been seeing each other for about 3 months, we've go on dates almost every weekend, and we've have had sex on almost all these dates. In my mind I've seen us as sort of casually (but exclusively) seeing each other until we decide if we want to be a couple. I like him a lot, but certain parts of his personality annoy me sometimes so I'm trying to stay open to the situation so I can make an informed decision on if we're really that compatible. Besides that though, there's a couple reasons why I'm getting mixed signals. 

First off, communication is lacking/weird between us. We live an hour and a half apart so we can't just casually meet up when we're both busy during the week. He doesn't text me at all during the week unless it's to make plans for the weekend. He never asks me about my week or asks what I'm up to whereas I'll usually check in once a week and ask him how things have been going. It's not that big of a deal to me since I'm not a big texter, but I've been noticing that even lately I'll be have to be the one to ask if he wants to hang out or go on a date. In the beginning he would text me a couple times a week and always set up plans for the weekend and it felt nice to be wanted like that.

My next issue is probably the bigger issue though. I feel like he's kind of hot and cold between acting like we're in a really serious relationship and just wanting sex. We have sex every time we meet up, which is great and I'm always up for it, but at some point it starts to feel like ""is this the only reason we meet up anymore?"". We still do date type things where we take walks in the park together and he'll always take me out to eat and refuses to let me pay, but I feel like there's always that sexual tension on our dates where I know he's just thinking about us having sex later. On the other hand though, he's been trying to get me to meet his parents which to me screams serious relationship. I'm open to meeting them, but I've had to say no both times for various reasons. The first time I had a scheduling conflict. The second time he asked me to meet them was during our last date. We'd just finished having sex and he was like ""let's get dressed. I want to drive you to my parents house so you can meet them"". That was really weird so I was like ""Umm no. I'd feel really weird seeing your parents when we just had sex and I'm in the same clothes and sweaty"".

My third and last issue is my deal breaker issue. He's just graduated with his masters and he's applying to jobs right now. He originally planned to stay in the area to be near family and because he likes it here. On our last date though, he told me that he had applied for a couple of jobs that were two states away. This really shocked me because I had assumed he was staying in the area like we had talked about. I can transfer to different offices around the country at my job pretty easily, but my job doesn't have an office close to where he would be working if he got the jobs he applied for. I sort of didn't say anything about it though and just told him good for him. I know he's stressed about getting a job, so I don't want to feel like he has to limit his options for any reason. It did hurt having to smile through it though. Later on during the date he brought it up again and was talking about how we'd be 4 or 5 hours apart if he got one of the jobs there. I sort of laughed awkwardly and agreed that would be a really long distance. He didn't really say anything after that about it, and he was just holding my hand.

I don't know guys. I'm just feeling really confused right now, and I don't want him to move away. If we were to continue at our current level of communication with him being that far away, I think we'd have to end it. I'm wondering why he would even apply for the jobs that far away. If he doesn't want to be with me, why does he want me to meet his parents so badly? I'm considering putting our relationship on hold until he gets a full time job and I know where he's going to end up, because at this point I don't want to fall for him too hard and have him move away.

It could be misinterpretation, but I also feel like she’s giving me mixed signals which is making it alot harder for me to convince myself she’s just a friend.

When people are offering advice for how to become more attractive (*especially* for men); one of the main situations people discuss is charisma.

What people *must* realise is that charisma is not something you can just tell a person ‘to get’ like you would go and buy a drink. You can’t tell people to ‘go and get a personality.’ It doesn’t work like that.

You are what you are. Some people come
off more charismatic and have a better personality, simply by being better looking. This sets off endorphins in the brain that makes you *believe* they are more charismatic than someone else; until they do some awful shit and that charisma melts away like ice cream.

Telling an ugly person to get charisma (by definition of looks and personality, is like telling a footballer to become Ronaldo. It just doesn’t happen like that. Charm and personality *can be* built through ones energy of consistent happiness and engagement in social skills and confidence.

But don’t confuse this with just going out and ‘getting something’. We can *all* be charismatic especially when we don’t realise it. Sometimes we have ugly, but *human* moments.

Our first date was great, a gym date with smoothies after where we sat on the park bench and just talked about life. She was super nervous when we first met, she was shy and hid from me at the gym and I had to approach her. On our date, she was hesitant to look me in the eyes but we had a good time I made her laugh and the chemistry was great. A day or two later we're texting and she says she had a dream about me, me being cocky, joke about it being sexual where she denies it obviously, so I hit her up with the ""so if I invited you over right now you wouldn't come?"".... well she ended up coming over. One thing led to another and I had to stop myself because I'm not sexually promiscuous and wanted something real, I pause, bring her into my arms and ask what she's looking for. She says she wants to go with the flow but would be open to the idea of a relationship, she also mentioned she was cheated on a year and a half ago. I state that I was looking for a relationship but that I needed to know If she wanted to be exclusive (and yes I know, its asking a lot to be exclusively dating after one date. My personality type is that I like to focus on one person that I am talking to and if things were to ever get sexual I wouldn't want to be an option etc) She agrees to the exclusiveness and actually ends up staying the night, spooning pillow talk etc. She texts me every day sending tik toks and flirting with me a little too fast for me but I match her energy to let her know I'm still interested. On our second date I took her hiking, she made out with me we talked about life and commitment, (some deep conversations that I wouldn't normally have with someone) She hand feeds me food on the ride back and does this weird love bite? Whatever I guess it's cute in the moment. Two days later I invite her over to stay the night and again it gets hot and heavy. I get her off with my hands and then my biggest fear happens, I CANT GET HARD. I have no idea why, she's super attractive and I just mentally cock blocked myself. I thought I was ready for a moment like this and I just was simply not there. I thought I played it off really well, didn't make much of a stink and we both laughed and she didn't seem bothered by it. Some more pillow talk that night and she tells me that she had changed my contact name to ""babe"" and that all her friends knew about me and that she told them she really liked me. She said it reluctantly too almost as if she was scared to express that she was into me. The next morning I get her off again twice, I don't bother trying to get myself off because I'm just not there mentally and can't enjoy the moment. I give her my hoodie to cover her hickeys while she goes to work, we kiss and it's like nothing bad ever happened, although it was not the ideal first hookup I made the best of the situation and she still seemed interested. That morning her texts are still flirty saying she had a great time last night, saying she was going to keep my hoodie, that her hair would be all over my apartment etc. A day goes by and I notice the response times get longer, then I get hit with the notorious I'm not ready for a relationship, she says she's not emotionally or mentally ready to give someone her 100% and offers to be friends.  I ask if she changed her mind because of the sex and she says no, she insists that she's simply not ready and that getting into a relationship with me when she can't give 100% wouldn't be fair.  I honestly did not know how to feel about this, while we did build some level of trust I wanted to believe she was telling the truth but at the same time I have to assume that this is the universal term for ""I'm just not into you"". I send her this heartfelt paragraph of how I enjoyed my time with her and respectfully decline her invitation to be friends because honestly, I know what I want in dating/relationship and I refuse to be an option to someone that's unsure. I tell her that I have to remove her on social media because that's how I cope and move on, I know some of you may view that as childish but it's how I best deal with breakups. The next day I arrange plans to meet at the gym to grab my hoodie back, we agree to meet at two. Two comes around and she's not there, she flaked. I text asking for the hoodie and get a response 7 hours later saying that she was sorry that she got caught up in stuff and that she would leave it with the other gym receptionist tomorrow. Tomorrow rolls around I go to the gym and she ends up going at the exact time I go, we pass each other a couple of times and don't exchange a word, totally awkward. A couple of times she passes in front of me almost like trying to get my attention or something but I don't bother. I notice that she leaves the gym and I make my way to the front desk to get my hoodie.

Our first date was great, a gym date with smoothies after where we sat on the park bench and just talked about life. She was super nervous when we first met, she was shy and hid from me at the gym and I had to approach her. On our date, she was hesitant to look me in the eyes but we had a good time I made her laugh and the chemistry was great. A day or two later we're texting and she says she had a dream about me, me being cocky, joke about it being sexual where she denies it obviously, so I hit her up with the ""so if I invited you over right now you wouldn't come?"".... well she ended up coming over. One thing led to another and I had to stop myself because I'm not sexually promiscuous and wanted something real, I pause, bring her into my arms and ask what she's looking for. She says she wants to go with the flow but would be open to the idea of a relationship, she also mentioned she was cheated on a year and a half ago. I state that I was looking for a relationship but that I needed to know If she wanted to be exclusive (and yes I know, its asking a lot to be exclusively dating after one date. My personality type is that I like to focus on one person that I am talking to and if things were to ever get sexual I wouldn't want to be an option etc) She agrees to the exclusiveness and actually ends up staying the night, spooning pillow talk etc. She texts me every day sending tik toks and flirting with me a little too fast for me but I match her energy to let her know I'm still interested. On our second date I took her hiking, she made out with me we talked about life and commitment, (some deep conversations that I wouldn't normally have with someone) She hand feeds me food on the ride back and does this weird love bite? Whatever I guess it's cute in the moment. Two days later I invite her over to stay the night and again it gets hot and heavy. I get her off with my hands and then my biggest fear happens, I CANT GET HARD. I have no idea why, she's super attractive and I just mentally cock blocked myself. I thought I was ready for a moment like this and I just was simply not there. I thought I played it off really well, didn't make much of a stink and we both laughed and she didn't seem bothered by it. Some more pillow talk that night and she tells me that she had changed my contact name to ""babe"" and that all her friends knew about me, that she canceled hot girl summer because of me and that she told them she really liked me. She said it reluctantly too almost as if she was scared to express that she was into me. The next morning I get her off again twice, I don't bother trying to get myself off because I'm just not there mentally and can't enjoy the moment. I give her my hoodie to cover her hickeys while she goes to work, we kiss and it's like nothing bad ever happened, although it was not the ideal first hookup I made the best of the situation and she still seemed interested. That morning her texts are still flirty saying she had a great time last night, saying she was going to keep my hoodie, that her hair would be all over my apartment etc. A day goes by and I notice the response times get longer, then I get hit with the notorious I'm not ready for a relationship, she says she's not emotionally or mentally ready to give someone her 100% and offers to be friends. I ask if she changed her mind because of the sex and she says no, she insists that she's simply not ready and that getting into a relationship with me when she can't give 100% wouldn't be fair. I honestly did not know how to feel about this, while we did build some level of trust I wanted to believe she was telling the truth but at the same time I have to assume that this is the universal term for ""I'm just not into you"". I send her this heartfelt paragraph of how I enjoyed my time with her and respectfully decline her invitation to be friends because honestly, I know what I want in dating/relationship and I refuse to be an option to someone that's unsure. I tell her that I have to remove her on social media because that's how I cope and move on, I know some of you may view that as childish but it's how I best deal with breakups. The next day I arrange plans to meet at the gym to grab my hoodie back, we agree to meet at two. Two comes around and she's not there, she flaked. I text asking for the hoodie and get a response 7 hours later saying that she was sorry that she got caught up in stuff and that she would leave it with the other gym receptionist tomorrow. Tomorrow rolls around I go to the gym and she ends up going at the exact time I go, we pass each other a couple of times and don't exchange a word, totally awkward.

Long story short, I come from a conservative background (I'm not), so I only had a gf in high school and the most we did was hold hands. pretty sure she didn't even like me nor did I like her, so I tend to not count her as a real gf, and we broke up eventually. 

Now, I'm 20M dating 20F. I met this woman that's super fucking awesome, and we got to know eachother for a month as friends, before she said she liked me (and i did too) so now we're dating.

We've been on a few dates that went amazingly well. We're both so into eachother. I like her A LOT. and she likes me a lot too. 
However, a couple of days ago, we went out with our friend group, had drinks and had lots of fun. Until now, everything is absolutely fucking awesome. 
I woke up the next day feeling anxious and depressed. I've had history with depression and anxiety, but I've known how to deal with it my entire life. I've never had a gf, let alone someone to like me as much as she does, so I'm afraid that I don't actually like her? I think I do, and she seems like the perfect person for me, but is my mind just being anxious and telling me something is wrong? or is there some truth to it?

if I think about it logically, we have so many things in common, I enjoy being with her, and i get a boner just thinking about her (btw is this good or bad?). 

Sometimes, I get scared of the imaginary scenario where I tell her we're not gonna work out, because I feel like I WANT to be with her, but for some reason I'm scared to actually commit??

I'm not sure wtf is happening with me, but I don't have much experience dating.

Heyy so I’ll (try to) keep it short, here’s the situation: I’m part of an association in college and a few days ago we had a party with old and new members. I met this new guy and during the evening he was trying to make some small talk with me but I was so tired that I really didn’t want to socialize much with the new ones tbh hahah (also, he asked me how old I was and I told him I was 19... and he said wow ok I’m 26) However, time went buy and I didn’t care about being tired anymore, I just wanted to drink and enjoy the night. 

After a few hours, I was feeling quite tipsy and thought to myself: “Actually this guy is pretty cute” so I got a bit closer to him and we were just you know talking a bit, laughing and stuff. Then some bachata music came up so I was like: “wanna dance?” And of course he accepted. So we danced and let’s say we were pretty close if you know what I mean. Anyways, the vibe was cool, he tried to talk to me some more after the dance but I was drunk by then so I don’t remember much anyways.

The day after, I follow requested him on insta (that was 4days ago) and he still hasn’t accepted my request... BUT he sent me an invitation on LinkedIn today oh my days I can’t 😭 
Also, on Sunday I went to play soccer with the boys and he was there, however we didn’t talk at all which was pretty sad lol.

I just want to paint a full picture of the situation.


 I'm a 22 year old guy who's recently realized that I'm not as completely straight as I thought I was my entire life. I've been talking to this guy on tinder for a few weeks. I'll call him JV. He's basically the perfect guy. He's very attractive and talented. He's a former model, he can sing and play a lot of instruments. We started messaging each other on snapchat and he started talking about how he wants to do dirty things to me. 


I told him that I don't like to talk sexually with someone when I don't know them that well, we've only been talking for a few days at most at that point. He told me that I made it seem like I didn't want to have sex with him, and that I should because I know that he likes me. I told him that I did, but I like to take things slow, and he understood. 


He's told me that he's obsessed with me and falling for me, how he can see himself spending his life with me, and how the reason other dates I went on didn't lead to another one was because no one else is as smart as me, and that he's probably my perfect match. I'm basically social inept, never been in any relationships and only been on a few dates, but this seemed like everything I was longing for. A really attractive guy really liked me. I couldn't believe it.


 I told him about bad experiences I've had with people on dating apps before and he said that I must attract crazy people, but now I have him, and he'll sing me to sleep at night. I'm socially awkward so I've never been in a relationship before, and have only been on 3 dates so far, but this seems like something that I've been longing for for a while. The only potential issue is that we live an hour away from each other and I can't drive yet (I've taken driving lessons on and off over the years but I just have difficulty with it.) 


We videochatted a few days before we planned to go on a date. During the call, he told me that he was ""complicated"". He told me that he cheated on his previous boyfriend with older men because he has ""daddy issues"" and his ex boyfriend didn't satisfy his sexual needs, that one of his flaws is that he likes sex too much and that he blew JV off and didn't spend time with him a lot. This made me a little nervous, especially because me and him live an hour away from each other and JV and his ex boyfriend did too. 


But when I brought up my concerns to him the next day, he assured me that he regretted cheating in his previous relationship. We set up a date on a weekend, to go to a diner near me for lunch. We were texting the night before and I mentioned a first date I went on last year where the guy tried to have sex with me, and how it made me feel because I don't like to have sex on the first date. JV replied saying that maybe we should cancel the date and go our separate ways because we're too different of people.  I told him that was probably for the best, as I didn't know where we could have sex because my family lives with my stepdad and he doesn't like me, my sister or any of his kids having significant others spend the night at the house. JV said that his ex stayed over at his house when they were dating, and that his family was fine with it, so I could too. 


He asked if I'd be able to fulfill his sexual needs and I told him that I could change my sexual boundaries for him, and he said that he thinks that this relationship could work. We went on the date and it went well. He told me that he usually doesn't drive an hour to meet someone for the first time, and that he didn't think he'd be trying to get into a relationship so soon after his last one ended, but that there was something about me that changed his mind on those things. We had lunch and then we went to a nearby park and made out for a bit on a nature trail. It was my first kiss. He asked if I wanted to go further, and I said that I didn't. 

After the date, we kept texting and we planned a second date. He said that he wanted to have sex with me on the second date and that if it was good, I'd be his boyfriend. We started talking about what kind of stuff we'd do to each other and sending each other nudes. He asked if I'd take him to my room to have sex on the second date, and I reminded him that I couldn't do that. He said that it had to be in his car then, which I thought was kind of strange, since the reason we were even still talking to each other was because he assured me that we could have sex at his house. His family was moving soon, but he knew about that before the night before the first date, so it wasn't like it unexpectedly came up after.


 I asked him if we would wear condoms, and he said that if we were dating, that we'd only be having sex with each other, so we wouldn't have to, and also that he wanted to cum inside me. He assured me that he was clean and taking medication to prevent getting HIV. He tried to text me his latest test but he said that it wouldn't send for some reason. 


I realized that even though I found him very attractive and he kind of drove me crazy, I didn't want to have sex on the second date. It's just too soon for me. I feel like I don't really know someone that well after talking for a few weeks and going on one date. I told him that I didn't feel like we were sexually compatible and that we should probably stop talking. He got upset, saying that I was acting like he was a sex addict and that he was hurt that I would assume that about him.

On each of my profiles, I let people that I have Asperger’s.

I do this because I’ve seen how people look at me. I may not be the best at reading social cues, but I can still see the expressions on several peoples’ faces. The way that I walk like a penguin and on my toes, no less. The sound of my high-pitched voice, as if I never escaped puberty. That I make too little or too much eye contact when in a conversation, provided that I can even keep it flowing. The distress on my face when I try a food or drink and my taste buds are instantly adverse to it. Et cetera, et cetera. That’s not even taking into account things such as my social and general anxiety and my poor motor skills.

So, when I have say Asperger’s, I suppose it’s more of a cautionary thing. It lets women know that “Hey, I have issues that can’t be fixed, have always been part of my life and will always be a part of my life. But if you can look beyond my awkwardness, perhaps we can chat and maybe get together?”

That hope that I can weed out those would be immediately disinterested and maybe find someone who will like me in spite of these things.

Some of you may be thinking, “Why not just take the autism part out of your profiles?”

Because if I were to somehow land a date and THEN they see my autism on display without prior warning, they’ll leave/reject and that feels way more dejecting.

He was stationed near where I lived at the time. 


Looking back, I had NO BUSINESS being on any dating apps at that time, as I had just gotten on my feet after dealing with some serious domestic problems that caused me to be hyper independent (dealing with repercussions of abusive parents,) and finally got on my feet after struggling with homelessness/housing instability from since I was 17, at no fault of my own (I was 19 turning 20 when I met him fwiw.) I’ll spare the details.


Anyway, we ended up meeting and we clicked instantly, except I was still in this strange, almost apathetic/jaded headspace since I was going through a lot of necessary life changes around this time, so I didn’t feel completely safe or present with him, and my dialogue seemed limited.


Looking back, the few times he and I met up for dates, we had our quirks. we’re both so silly &amp; fun, and hit it off well, but I may have unintentionally pushed him away. 


After connecting and even building a friendship, he was deployed across seas for about 6 months, then returned after that. We maintained friendly contact during this time (nothing serious, but he definitely liked me more than I liked him back then) and even met up again for drinks when he came back. Things just ebbed &amp; flowed with our connection, regardless of status.


Now this is where it gets petty/embarrassing for me. 


The conversation from this is a bit of a blur to me, but one day he was texting me, and he ended up sending me a shirtless photo. Despite me being formerly homeless and living a not so nice life for a hot second, I had HIGH morals and was very conservative at the time when this happened (religious manipulation/abuse played a role in my upraising &amp; living situation.) 


If my memory serves me correct, I didn’t handle receiving the picture well. Like at all. I almost impulsively cut him out. I think I somewhat berated him about it, Basically saying “why would you send that to me? I don’t like being sent photos like that.” To which he apologized and felt bad about. 


Looking back, I realize it’s okay to have boundaries, BUT, my behavior was waaaay too conservative. Today I would’ve ENCOURAGED him to send that photo haha. I’m no longer religious, and realized how oppressed I was (including sexually) because of false religious teachings and other things.


Here’s the thing; even after I expressed myself about the photo, he handled it so well. He didn’t have an attitude or ego about it, and long story short, we stayed friend for YEARS even after that. It ended up that way naturally.


He would eventually go on to being stationed in Europe, where he’s been since 2017. We both went on to pursue other people and places. 


Over those years, he’s seen me go through other relationships/breakups via social media, and never judged, ghosted, or disconnected from me despite that. 


Around the time he was initially stationed in Europe, we didn’t actively talk, but would interact on social media here and there. 


After about two years since we last met up, he randomly messaged me on Snapchat talking about his experience being stationed in Europe. He then says he misses me and wants me to consider visiting him in Europe at some point. I was blind-sided by that. 


Again, yet another thing that should’ve been taken as flattery, but I got scared off by. I basically told him I’m working a lot, and a trip like that is a pretty big deal for someone I haven’t seen in years. 


Around this time I had also just ended things with someone else (which he saw on my social media.) I also unfriended him on Facebook long before this Snapchat conversation (again, dumb on my behalf,) but never removed him from Instagram or Snapchat before this, but idk if he cared/noticed right away. 


A few months after this, I checked my Snapchat, just to see he had deleted me from his Instagram and Snapchat. Turns out he found himself a girlfriend where he’s stationed at, and has been with this girl ever since. 


I know most people aren’t going to take kindly to this, and yes this goes against my traditions, BUT, lately he’s been in my minds eye randomly. 


Most people will probably tell me to leave him alone (which I probably will tbh lol) but I truly feel in my heart I pushed a good one away, and missed out on a great opportunity to be with someone who I could develop and travel around the world with. 


In my gut, I sense he’s not going to stay with this girl once his time is up in the military. I know this is somewhat toxic, but miracles and strange stuff happens daily, and life’s too short for missed connections.

In my 20s, I’ve had a three relationships lasting from 1-2 years and flings in between and then probably 200+ dates in between... all to say I’ve become a bit exhausted and jaded.

Getting dates has never really been an issue, but finding something that lasts and has substance has proven very very very difficult. 

Before 27 I met all my SOs naturally, but since then it’s been almost exclusively online dating with a mixed bag that has left me with all sorts of emotions. I’ve fallen into this online dating cycle and it stresses me out so much and my biggest fear in the world is to end up alone and I still can’t pinpoint exactly why I’m so afraid to be alone. My last relationship ended during lockdown and it put me in a really bad headspace to recover and I do find myself ruminating and lamenting about past relationships that can’t completely stunt my mood. Like self sabotage. 

I’m currently seeing somebody right now and she’s a total sweetheart but I don’t feel that spark with her and Im not completely physically attracted to her and it really stresses me out because it makes me feel so superficial and I’m unsure about my future with her but I’m also really hesitant to enter the dating world again, so just wondering ideas how I can turn around my mindset and shift back into positivity.

Meaning we’d only see each other every weekend or so for a day or two at a time. Then it’s back to our respective work life during the week. 

In all of my past relationships, my partner lived at minimum an hour away. Some even further away. That wasn’t by choice. it just so happened to be that way. 

I’m now in a relationship where we can see each other more often for longer periods of time but I always find an excuse to keep our meetings under 2 days per week. 

Truth is, after spending a night together and maybe getting breakfast/lunch the next day i’m ready to go back home and be by myself. It’s like it’s more enjoyable for me to do things solo. Watching tv, movies, riding my bike, listening to music, eating, etc. All are more enjoyable solo for me.

The longer i’m with someone the more the urge is for me to drive home and watch movies on the couch or play music loudly. 
Do I enjoy spending time with my partner doing those things? Yes. but I can’t ignore that it’s more enjoyable solo for me though. 

It feels like I no longer know how to have a full time relationship with someone. 

The same goes for platonic friendships as well. Seems like I only have 1-2 days to give someone before I want to go home and just be alone.

So I worry about my romantic future. If I feel like spending more than two days with my partner feels like something I have to do and not something I want to do then that’s a problem in my eyes.

Initially, I wasn’t all that into him until after we met in person. We went on two dates and then we ended up sleeping together. I enjoyed our time and he seemed to have enjoyed it as well, however I noticed that he avoids expressing himself maybe because he fears rejection. He waits on me to initiate saying “I miss him” or that I want to see him. For example, I asked him one day what location he was working at that day. He told me and then asked why I had asked. I said “oh I just wanted to be nosey lol.” He said “oh I thought you missed me or something.” So then I thought okay, that implies he probably misses me but why doesn’t he just say it first? What the hell. ...!?
We had conversation about plans because he said he’s a last minute person and I’m not. I actually plan out my week and what not but will also make time for people I want to see. He shared that since I’m a planner, he realizes if I don’t plan anything, he won’t see me. That sort of annoyed me because I want to know you want to see me also. I don’t like taking the lead in everything. I like when men initiate and then both parties put forth effort. He didn’t respond to me when I told him that in a text. 
I also told him in the beginning that I’m leaving in august to teach abroad. He joked about me not going and also joked about him coming along. Well at least I took it as a joke because he seems to test me often when he says things. I didn’t think he was serious because things are also new. 

Anyway, he’s recently been very quiet. We don’t talk much and it bothers me. I feel like he sort of fell back because of my comment about initiating or the fact that I’m leaving so he doesn’t want to get too attached. I just wish communication was easier in general. Why does everything have to be so complicated? 

What should I do next? Do I leave it alone? Do I reach out? I feel like I’m overextending myself in a way though..",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,809512,public,self,Am I asking for too much?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nq0g4l/am_i_asking_for_too_much/,all_ads,6,,,,False,,

I’ve video called and gone on a date in person. We also have plans for this weekend. I think learning about them and spending time with them is fun/interesting. 

I also find them attractive, but I don’t think this person is someone I’d like to date seriously. I’m very independent and have been taking care of myself since high school. Being with someone still at home with no license or car is a bit out of my preference range. Maybe for the right person I’d make an exception, but they’ve been late to both our dates so far. Although they stayed late/called till they fell asleep which is weird I guess. Anyway I want this as something fun and to get a new connection, but I doubt I want this to become a serious boyfriend/girlfriend relationship. Moving out and being on your own changes you.

 Do I have to tell the other person this? At what point would it be leading someone on? I stopped matching new people on my apps because I enjoyed the people I was talking with, but none are exactly what I’m looking for yet. But I just didn’t want to get overwhelmed.

Heres my story,

So I reconnected with an old friend from college over the winter after 6 years, she knew I liked her back then but she was dating someone else at the time and just never came to anything, pretty much ended our friendship. Anyways somehow we stay friends in social media and somehow started talking again, and the relationship got closer over the months. We made plans to meet after covid got better and both got vaccinated, so we talked for about 4-5 months before we finally set a date to meet. She was super excited as the date got closer and also made plans for future dates after the visit, we really had a good connection back in college and at the time of texting.

Anyways, I drove to her hometown and went on a date, I planned the whole night out and she seem to loved it. We shared a big warm hug, and went about the night, we really had a great time! we shared some laughs and old stories about college, and she really opened up about her personal life, career and other stuff. Finally when the place closed I drove her to her car, and then I told her I had a small surprise for her back at the place I rented for the night and she can follow me with her car to make her feel comfortable. She follow me and I show her around the place, she sat in the living room and I brought the surprise out. it was champagne and chocolate strawberries (corny I know, but I thought it was a nice touch). We made out after that for a little, I ask her if this was going to fast and she said not at all, I made a move for third base and she said she wasn't ready for that and I immediately stopped of course, we talked for a little more and we shared some personal conversations. Before walking her out, I asked her to get a bite before heading back the next day and she said she'd love too. Walked to her car, kissed her goodnight and went to bed.

The next day she texted me early saying she couldn't meet due to some family obligations, but that she loved everything and could not wait to meet again and wanted to see me more often. I said no problem (which really wasn't it was a last minute invite) and that I looked forward to see her again. we said that we could meet up again in a few weeks and that I would planned it out and she seemed excited. I went about my day and texted a little through it, everything seem fine.

This is where stuff got weird, a couple days after I texted her in the morning (we are both early birds and regularly texted early in the morning) wishing her good luck with her new job role, she only reply with a heart response and was about to type something (iphone dots) but then went away. Again, no big deal I've done that before, but no response for the remaining of the day, and two days after that. I texted her again after 3 days and she responded differently then usual, without saying my name and a short reply. Again, no big deal since I thought maybe shes busy and stressed with her new job role, so I gave her a couple weeks to settle in, after all the girl told me how easier and better is to get through life with me. I texted her again after those 2 weeks but expecting the worse too, no one goes two weeks without talking or texting after constantly communicating almost everyday, but I thought with the time maybe she would be happy to talk. Texted her and she replied almost immediately but being short, dry and direct, not upbeat like usual. I try to keep the conversation going but when I asked her about our upcoming hangout date she flat out ignore me, even thought she was the one who invited me to it first. I took like a man, and knew it was done, I was sad but felt a little more relieved.

Now that problem is, after a couple of weeks, I still can't shake this awful feeling. I feel guilty that I might have come out too strong and screw it, I feel sad and dissapointed that she couldn't be more honest and tell me she wasn't about it anymore, and I feel so angry at myself for wasting so much time thinking over this over and over. It really sucks, she was my best friend twice in my life. It sucks even more that she still watches my social media stories almost after posting them every time and i keep seeing her name come up. I honestly feel pathetic writing this but its also kind of helping. I decided to go back into cutting and lifting more often to boost my self confidence since its an all time low, and learning a new software to keep me busy.

A lot of people say that this method doesn't work and you'll come off creepy.

And honestly, I get what they're saying, but I disagree.

Cold approaching has literally changed my life, even in ways beyond dating. All of the women I've gone out on dates with have been through cold approaching. I'm personally not a male model-looking guy (I have the good fashion sense and groom myself) but I've met and dated women WAY out of my league through cold approaching them in public, including professional models, sorority girls, etc. Granted I live in Chicago so the quality of women in a big city is different compared to a smaller city, but my point is that you can meet women YOU are attracted to through cold approach, rather than mindlessly swiping on Tinder, only matching with girls you don't even like. Plus, you can connect with a lot of girls on a much deeper level personality-wise, allowing you to screen out women who would otherwise be too good for you.

In addition, there's so many benefits to cold approach. You become better with people in general, you become less terrified of rejection, and you build so much confidence in yourself. I understand why many people despise this method, because it's something that only those cringy pickup artists and salespeople do. But normal guys CAN do this as well by simply being normal. 

If you've tried cold approach and afterwards, said ""Well this doesn't work, guess I'm going to be forever alone"", you either went about it the wrong way or you just gave up after just 1 approach.

Personally I think this strategy would change lives of SO many men. It's extremely hard to find someone nowadays, and I think we should all be more open to more ways of meeting new people.

I didn’t take him seriously first because he was phrasing it quite jokingly but I kept pushing to ask if he was serious and he gave an answer like “if you’re down then sure”. The first week after this, we spoke everyday over message and he was being too intense for my liking. Every time he would say something about spending our life together I’d just ignore that part of the message and keeps he conversation going. I mention I need time but I never mentioned whether I was actually interested. He got the hint that he was being too forward after we went a whole weekend not speaking.

Now, he’s a lot more chilled and we still talk everyday. He still hints majorly that he wants to be with me and I can say that I’ve started to catch feelings. However, this might just be because of exams, but whenever I flirt with him he says something ridiculous like “sorry I have a wife”. Like he’s scared of rejection or misinterpreting. Last night we phoned for hours and every time I’d dig into him about who he likes he would say we can speak about it when finals are over. Just before we got off the phone, we had a bit of an intense flirting sesh where he asked if I want to be his *insert any female half of a TV couple* and I was like hmm perhaps and I ended the call for effect. An hour later I messaged him saying I’ll b his *other half* and he messaged back “I’m gay sorry” . Why is he being difficult when I actually like him back??

Soo, I recently got back in contact with an old friend after literally 10 years. We’ve never met, but we live in the same city and we once exchanged “pics” when we were like 16 and we’ve always been quite flirty.

Off the bat, things were flirty again and he told me how I’ve always been beautiful and I Iightly flirted back. I’m a single mother to a toddler after my son’s dad got a traumatic brain injury which resulted in a personality change and safeguarding issues after I was pregnant, but that’s another story. I understand kids aren’t for everyone when it comes to dating and that’s partially why I’m not bothered about finding someone else atm.

He asked me out for a drink after asking if I was single, and I politely declined saying he’s handsome but it feels too soon and I have my hands full with a toddler and I wasn’t intending to date again, at least for a while. Straight away, he became defensive saying that it’s a shame I said no, and that just because he asked me out for a drink doesn’t mean it’s a date or that he wants anything lol. So I thought, that settles it and I’ll never hear from him again and I can just get on with my day.

Anyway, every day since he’s been getting into conversations with me and lightly (now) flirting here and there and tonight he asked me out for a drink again as “friends” saying he think we’d be amazing friends and that OBVIOUSLY there’s no sexual attraction whatsoever.

Here’s the interesting thing though, I’ve found myself changing my mind and seeing him as relationship potential, but I feel this situation is too much of a mindf*ck that I’m wanting to drop him completely.

I mentioned in another post that I wasn't exactly blindsided since things had been really slowing down towards the end. But something I never did in that little essay was take responsibility for my own actions, or more accurately, my lack of action. Now the initial shock and frenzy of emotion has subsided and it's time for me to reflect on my shortcomings and hold myself accountable. 

I wanted to give her everything, and I made her promises that I didn't keep. We talked about visiting some destinations together. I said I'd look at my work schedule, but those plans never materialized. I said I'd bring over some dishes we could cook together or bake together. Those plans never materialized. I said I'd send her a form to help her with her grad school apps. I never sent it. Never once did I take the initiative, be spontaneous and make it happen.

It'd be easy for me to blame her or blame my soul crushing job or blame my anxiety and depression. But I can't and I won't. If I can't hold myself accountable how could I ever expect others to fulfill their promises to me? I said I would but I didn't. It really is as simple as that. 

She never mentioned any of these things when she broke it off. She kept it vague: *""I don't think this relationship is going to work out. I'm sorry.""* But upon even a surface level reflection it's obvious to me that I was complacent. I wasn't achieving her expectations - or even my own. She wasn't having fun with me and I wasn't even making the effort to be a fun person. 

When you make promises to someone and don't follow through it communicates that you don't value them. You don't hold them as a priority. Who would want a relationship like that? Who wants the low spot on someone else's totem pole? It's not something I would ever accept. I can say all day long that I cared about her and valued her. But care and value are as much about action as they are about how you feel. You can't have one without the other.

In addition to being hurt and saddened by the breakup I have an overwhelming feeling of regret. Regret for my loss of the relationship, certainly, but even more regret that I didn't put my first foot forward. Regret that I didn't apply all of the attributes that I know I have. Regret that I didn't do the things I know I'm capable of. 

No more. I'm done living in this funk, this emotional squalor. I'm done watching opportunities and relationships pass me by because I don't apply myself. I was once a vibrant being, full of life and energy. I will be again. I'm laser focused on doing so. 

I know she'll never see this, so this is really for myself. I have an urge to apologize to her but I'm not sure how it would benefit either of us. At this point it would come across as me trying to desperately admit blame in an effort to 'win' her back. At this point I'm so embarrassed I don't think I even want her back. Moving forward to something new with a refocused effort is easier and healthier than trying to repair something that's already over. I'm just sorry the price for this realization was a relationship with someone I cared about. 

Now I turn my attention to you....yes YOU, dear internet reader. I've given you a glimpse into my soul and now I implore you to heed my example. Stop what you're doing and take stock of your relationships. Take stock of your actions. Take stock of your ambitions. Are you putting in the effort that your pursuits deserve?

I was setup with someone, and we've had a few incredible dates so far. There are no dry spells, we enjoy each others company, and overall the  dates have gone amazing. We have even hooked up. There is just one major issue, the texting.

This has been going on from the beginning. She sometimes takes 24+ hours to respond. I have never dealt with this before, and it gives me major anxiety. Based off the in person interaction, it is incredible, however, the lack of responsiveness on text is hard. It makes it seem like she's not interested. She has apologized many times for being a shitty texter, however, I've never dealt with anything like this before. Part of me thinks I'm overthinking it, because she is still down to hang out even after she takes forever to respond. Or maybe there are just other people in the picture. However, it is really hard to plan stuff and almost impossible to carry a conversation over text. She has mentioned she has anxiety with making plans, so perhaps that is it. I just have never dealt with this before and want some advice. 

However, I recently tried to plan another date and she hasn't responded in 3 days. It is just really hard to read the situation because based off in person interaction, you would think it is going amazingly. I don't know what to do. What do you all think is the right thing to do.

A really good (girl) friend of mine invited me to her prom to her village to the other side of the country.  
I accepted and there were me, her, her boyfriend and I am guessing one of hers very good friend (none of them I knew prior) 

&amp;#x200B;

Sooo we start off getting to know each other on the train, dancing, singing and it was a pretty nice experience, and as you may already suggest I kinda had a crush on that other girl. But she was really 50/50. One time she would look at me and smile and other times she would totally ignore me.  


to make the long story short I understood she likes another guy because the girls (there were a lot of people there) went to talk about it in a way and I overheard it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the 50/50 continued and we took some photos and she took a hella lot of photos on my phone while it was charging (on the backseat of the car when we were heading back) and she was really my type from all angles. Our mutual friend created a post in which she tagged all of us and nothing happened but I checked her account and I noticed she had 9\*\* followers and 2\*\* following .

Today I checked and it was 1000+ followers and it kinda put me off as it was clear that she had a ton of fake followers. I then decided to speak to God about it as I was really only thinking of her and I flipped a coin of whether I should follow her or not... So the coin said its thing and I followed her maybe before 4-5 hours. I open my ig rn and she has a new story... didn't look at it ofc but it made me feel like I want to write it to Reddit, because fuck this girl and wtf does she think of herself. 

I am going to give her the benefit of the doubt for maybe 3 days and then unfollow her but wtf m8.

I am probably mad because all the indicators were pointing that we would be really nice fit but she had 0 interest in getting to know me so things would work out...

Well I met a girl I matched on Tinder. She seemed pretty normal in her texts, we arranged to meet one evening, without any particular plan. On the day of, I unfortunately had an emergency at work (I am a physician) so I had to ask her that we meet about 30 mins later (I did it one hour before the date, and it was fine for her), but we managed to meet in the early evening.

We meet at the train station and I suggested we walk towards the lake (there is a big lake in the middle of our city). She said she want to avoid the crowds so we took a side street. Now on first dates I usually just like to take a little walk around the city, and then sit down somewhere to drink something and chat a bit. I didn't really have a plan, and it seemed to annoy her greatly that I had to check google maps like once or twice. I was really trying to be polite, so I quickly decided on one of the places I know. This is literally a 15 minute walk through a nice part of town and on the lake. I tried to make a bit of small talk, as you do; I asked her where she works, she kind of blocked it, she said she doesn't like to talk about work because she is dissatisfied with her workplace. Then nothing. I don't mind quiet people by the way, but it seemed that if I didn't make conversation, she just didn't respond at all. Which obviously increased the tension.

When we arrived at the cafe we had to wait a bit to get seated (probably about 3 minutes). She still seemed annoyed by this. The waitress was pretty friendly but a bit stressed, but we managed to get a passable seat with a nice view of the lake.

When we sat down I asked her if she would min if I ate something, I was at work all day and was a bit hungry. She kind of said nothing, so I ordered a bit of food and some orange juice, and she ordered some other drink (I just realise now I don't remember what she ordered).
I got my food and I ate a bit, she just looked away and she seemed buried in thought, expression on her face. She said she doesn't like to look at people eating, especially if the other person has no food. She prefers doing something else than talking a walk, because she cannot look at the person and get to know them that way. I was a bit worried about me eating but was also curious, so I asked her (not in a provocative way), what she likes to do on dates. She said she likes to have a plan, for the date to be prepared, but she also like spontaneity?
I replied that I originally had (and I actually did) two options in mind, which did both involve having a little walk, one was going to see a little farm (it has cute animals and a nice view of the city) or to one of the cafes (there are tons of nice ones, there is no need to prepare this to be honest). She then told me I shouldn't tell her about the other option that we weren't doing (wut), she didn't like taking walks and going to cafes and that this is not a good date. Honestly, I don't mind someone expressing their dissatisfaction, but there are other ways to do it. I asked her what was a good date for her in the past, and she couldn't really say. 
We did kind of get a conversation going. She stated that she likes to be blunt and direct, but honestly one just got the feeling that she is either incredibly rude or has some personal issues. As we finished our drinks she already suggested we get the check. I was sad to see myself getting increasingly negative as the date progressed. I was simply trying to have a drink and a conversation with a stranger after work and this person was giving me the same vibes as if I've literally been torturing her. I walked her to the place where she parked the bike and said goodbye.

All in all, I just wanted to vent. If you'd like to join the conversation, please do. Maybe it is I who did something wrong and didn't realise it. But I've been OLD for about five years and up until know I've only had good experiences, with some nice conversations with interesting women, even two (albeit not very long) relationships. It actually got me to the happy conclusion that most people are pretty nice but this date today left me with the worst feeling ever. I feel sorry for her next dates.

I picked her up and planned for an hour or 2 but it turned into 3 hours of just getting to know each other a bit and sharing some laughs. Felt like a blind date. Afterwards I drove her back home and kissed her goodbye and she said “can’t wait to see you soon”

Left the date feeling rather happy and excited for the next one. She made quite the first impression on me. I texted her afterwards that I had a great time and I look forward to a second date and she never replied to my text.

I also live with my Mom because I cannot afford my own place while I'm trying to get my degree to become a programmer, I'm constantly depressed and I genuinely think I'm better off dead with the only thing really keeping me alive rn is not wanting to hurt my sister. I'm bisexual and a virgin at 26 and honestly I would rather die than be a virgin at 28 let alone 30, I'd also rather be dead than still be living with my mom at 30 as well and I'm seriously considering killing myself at 28 if I am still living with my mom or a virgin then.

I want to fall in love, I want to have my own place, my own career, I want a life and I'm trying but I cannot shake the belief that its just too late for me, that I'll be 30 at least when I get my degree and then it will be too late, that I'm too fucked up to be able to find a partner, hell who would want to be in a relationship with someone like me? and that it doesn't matter if I recover and I'm trying so goddamn hard to get better but I can't help feeling that its too late for me and it makes me want to simply die.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,809915,public,self,Is it too late for me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nq625b/is_it_too_late_for_me/,all_ads,6,,,,False,,

We have seen each other at least once a week for the last month. After we hooked up, she wanted to stress that mentally she was not in the place for a committed relationship and was more interested in having fun.  And that conversation somewhat came from her saying she was concerned I was coming on too strong. That being said, her actions often defy that. She is texting me everyday. When we see each other it is very intimate (holding hands, kissing, etc) and she often is talking about our relationship/situation and asking how I feel about it and stuff. The other day I told her that if I dated someone else or someone came around that is a better match,I would have to consider possibly moving on. And she told me she was disappointed by me saying that. She was even just upset about the idea that I would date someone else simultaneously. I should mention too that she is fairly younger than me....there is a 6 year difference (she is 23 and I am 29).

Now I did go on another date. This was a first date and the girl was cool, although I would say I wasnt extremely attracted as much as I would ideally want. But she is pretty and all of that - just maybe not head over heels about it. She was cool to hang out with. Nothing happened after the first date that night, but the next day she texted me that she wanted to invite me into her place to mess around and definitely wants to do that next time. And she stressed she just want it to be casual.

So now.....it seems like if I take this girl up on the FWB/casual situation and have sex, etc....it will ruin everything with the girl I have been dating for a bit. Im starting to think with these situations both coming to a head, that I talk to the girl I have been dating and ask essentially what she wants to do from here.
