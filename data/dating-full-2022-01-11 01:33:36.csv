I thought this was an odd move, but it ended up being quite nice. Well, the first two hours anyway..

It started off great. We had tea and pastries, I got to play with her dog and we were making decent conversation. She seemed happy and it appeared that she liked talking to me, but at around the two hour mark, something seemed started to feel a bit off. I‚Äôm pretty used to leading conversations on dates, so I thought things were going great because she was talking a lot. But then I realized she just kept talking and talking and talking... And she just wouldn't stop... For another 4 1/2 more hours. 

She just kept jumping from topic to topic, sometimes talking about certain topics for 15-20 minutes straight, then she‚Äôd think of something else and start talking about that topic and then the cycle would repeat. It began to feel like she was basically having a conversation with herself but I was just kinda in the room too.

I‚Äôm very much an introvert so I‚Äôd much prefer listening to talking, but even I have my limits. At a point, I was having trouble even keeping up with what she was saying because she talked so fast and because a lot of things weren't even about her, it was about random things like why she hates Kroger or crate-training animals, etc. She hardly paused long enough for me to even go ‚ÄúMhmm‚Äù or ‚ÄúRight.‚Äù I eventually stopped doing that just to see if she would notice that I wasn‚Äôt really engaged but it didn‚Äôt seem to phase her. I think she maybe asked me four actual questions in the 6 &amp; 1/2 hours I was there and even when I was given the chance to answer, she‚Äôd still cut me off and start going on another tangent. At one point, she had asked me about my job and I started telling her and she was like, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably like this right?‚Äù and then proceeded to perfectly describe what I do for a living in vivid detail, exactly the way I‚Äôd explain it to anyone so I was just like, ‚ÄúYup‚Ä¶ that pretty much sums it up.‚Äù I also remember asking her if she had ever been on a really bad date and she said ‚Äúno, most guys are just boring.‚Äù And I couldn‚Äôt help but think that she might think that because they never even really got the chance to say anything.

Around the five hour mark I was getting exhausted and honestly just wanted to leave, so I politely said, ‚ÄúWell I don‚Äôt want to keep you, so I should probably be going.‚Äù She was like ‚ÄúOh wow, it‚Äôs so late!‚Äù And then I shit you not, she started talking about how early the sun sets, which led to another hour long conversation with herself that I had to endure. I remember seriously thinking, ""I‚Äôm actually going to be stuck here all night.""

Thankfully, another opportunity arose where I could nicely ask to leave and we parted ways. Usually I try to be super courteous and set up the next date at the end of the first, but I kinda just hugged her, thanked her for the tea and awkwardly said goodbye because I was so emotionally drained.

I‚Äôm just so baffled by the whole situation. I‚Äôve never met someone who‚Äôs talked for that long in my entire life. I seriously can‚Äôt believe she didn‚Äôt lose her voice or like need a drink of water or something. Has anyone else ever experienced this before on a date? I really can‚Äôt understand why this happened. I truthfully don‚Äôt know if she had ADHD or if she was just so comfortable with me that she felt like she could just be super open? Or maybe she just doesn‚Äôt have many people to talk to?

I really don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm overthinking it but I‚Äôve never experienced this before on a date. I feel kinda bad because she was still very nice and accommodating so I want to maybe give her another shot.

The person in this post is my oldest guy friend. He was my first love, he meant the entire world to me. However I was SA'd by a classmate of mine, and in a panic and being only 17 years old, I pushed my oldest guy friend away because I didn't have the tools to deal with what had happened to me. It ended in a bad and nasty fight and we didn't speak for several years, but when we did, it was ugly nasty fighting.

My oldest guy friend began dating someone 4 years ago, and at that same time, I was in the midst of a 4.5 year abusive relationship. At that point, he and I were talking a little bit here and there.

\*Even though I still cared for him, I did nothing about it and still to this day have done nothing about it\*

When his relationship got more serious, he automatically just stopped talking to me. Which is fine, I chalked it up to it being life, that our bridge was burnt for good and it was time to move on.

In November, I was on a layover where he lived, and I was invited by his family to come over to their house for a few hours. Before I came over, I mentally talked myself into the reality that mine and his friendship was over, and that was that, and there was nothing more. To my surprise, he came back about 15 minutes after I had gotten there, and talked to me and asked me how life was going.

When it was time for me to leave, I opted for little physical contact because I was and still am dealing with trauma. The photo we took before I left is him with his arms around me, and before I left, hugged me tight for a few minutes.

The thing that had me questioning things though was that when I was there, he bashed his girlfriend. Not in a mean or abusive way at all, but the way he was talking about her made it seem like he didn't want to be in a relationship with her. He sounded-annoyed almost when I'd ask him questions.

And they weren't intrusive questions-just simple, polite small talk.

I saw on Facebook recently that his Facebook status changed, and she had removed the tag she had of being ""in a relationship with him"" And \*No\* I did not ask if they had broken up. That would be rude.

I was actually able to talk to him last night for the first time since he began dating this girl-and he responded.

Why would he talk to me after he changed his facebook status and the November visit?

\*Disclaimer: Hopefully redditors can be kind. I am legitimately wondering about this situation because I thought that mine and his friendship was over\*

I garner these deep connections. When I date the person I‚Äôm with is just the most incredible to me inside and out. We always connect well in terms of conversation and I find who I‚Äôm with the most handsome. 

The thing I‚Äôve never really had anyone be too enthusiastic about touching me. I‚Äôm a very skinny girl, I have small breasts/butt. I‚Äôm healthy, workout, I do care for my appearance like grooming and clothes etc.
I‚Äôve dated a bit but usually they say they like me because I‚Äôm sweet, intelligent, pretty, and have a great personality and what I have to offer is more special like my career, hobbies, being family oriented, etc. I don‚Äôt really need someone to feel sexy, but I also don‚Äôt need someone to make me feel like I‚Äôm not if that makes sense. 

In the past I‚Äôve tried to please my partners but they either make fun of my body (which I leave) or are just not interested in me sexually and say they don‚Äôt think of me that way. Me having to ask a guy to touch me and him saying he doesn‚Äôt think of looking at me topless but that I‚Äôm nice is embarrassing. Or not wanting to touch me and getting angry saying they can prefer different body types (which I agree with preferences are fine) They leave on my clothes, no one holds me so much, etc. 

I ask to be touched and held but they say it‚Äôs what‚Äôs inside that matters more, that I‚Äôm fishing for compliments since I know I‚Äôm pretty, etc. After these sorts of events I find it hard to be nude in front of my partner anymore. Maybe I‚Äôm just really sensitive and I know it‚Äôs kind of dumb, but I‚Äôd like the man I‚Äôm with to find me sexy too. I don‚Äôt expect him to be overly enthusiastic about taking off my shirt or anything, just to at least be‚Ä¶.interested?

Maybe that‚Äôs just in movies or tv or something though, I‚Äôm not sure if this actually exists? So many women struggle with finding someone who values them for the inside so I guess it does, I‚Äôve never had anyone want me more than just being ‚Äúpretty with a great personality.‚Äù I don‚Äôt want to be liked just for my looks, but the insults and disinterest are making me feel a bit nervous about dating

I have been extremely supportive to him and he knows that and appreciates it, however I still can‚Äôt help feeling unwanted and this is now making me anxious which results in me moaning at him. The thing I have noticed is sometimes he won‚Äôt read my message for hours but will be online which makes me feel like I am not important to him anymore. I‚Äôve spoken very openly with him and he apologised and doesn‚Äôt want me to feel like this.

I spent the weekend just gone with him and it was great however I noticed he was fidgeting a lot which he never used to, we went bowling and had a laugh then went back to his. I woke up to a message off him today and we exchanged a few texts then he goes silent again!

That being said, I don‚Äôt know how I feel about getting into dating again even when I am ready.

I‚Äôve been dating on and off for almost 4 years. I was in a long term relationship for several years before that with someone who thought they could ‚Äúfix‚Äù me. There‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned in that time: nobody wants someone who struggles with mental illness as much as I do.

For me personally, I struggle with severe anxiety and moderate depression. These things affect my life in a variety of ways, and they can all be worked around and overcome with time but it‚Äôs just been a real struggle. For example, I don‚Äôt drive because of my random panic attacks, and that alone seems to be a big deal, which I get on some level.

I‚Äôm not perfect, who is? But I like to think I look ok and that I‚Äôm a decent, thoughtful guy. But it feels like my mental health and the struggles that come with them cancel everything out. I get it, nobody wants to be in a position where they have to take care of someone or whatever, but I don‚Äôt need that. I don‚Äôt need, or even want, someone to take care of me. 

I just want someone who can accept these things, and support me when I need it, in the same way I‚Äôd accept and support them. But it feels like that person doesn‚Äôt exist. It feels like everyone either wants nothing to do with me, or feels like they have to fix me. 

So when I get over this little slump and I‚Äôm ready to get back into the dating world, why should I even bother?

I am a pretty late bloomer and am only just starting to look for relationships now (I have ADHD and only really began maturing this past year). 


I‚Äôve tried dating over the past year or so, but I‚Äôve gotten absolutely nowhere,and after asking a couple of friends, it‚Äôs apparently because many of them think I am only interested in men. Many people assume this because I am heavily involved with the arts and English, and, again ADHD, tend to be pretty high energy at times (additionally, I am built very thinly, am 5‚Äô9‚Äù, and have never managed to weigh more than 145 pounds, even with muscle). (Also, I‚Äôm aware that these are stupid and inaccurate stereotypes, which is why I‚Äôm looking for a little help.)


This doesn‚Äôt necessarily bother me, as I wouldn‚Äôt be entirely opposed to having a relationship with a man; it‚Äôs just that I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily actively pursue a relationship with a man, as I consider myself primarily straight for the most part. 


Even though it sounds pretty superficial, I was wondering if anyone here has had any similar experiences, and if so, had any advice on how to have a bit more of a presence with women past just being a friend or acquaintance?


This has been pretty discouraging for me as an introverted and pretty non-neurotypical person. Again, I apologize if this is the wrong thread to post this on, or if it seems superficial, but I would appreciate any advice you all can offer.

Hi \_\_\_\_\_\_,

Happy Thursday :) I hope your day is going alright. 

I just wanted to say, like I said earlier this week, I had a great time getting to know you. You seem like a nice guy, and I hope I showed you everywhere you were hoping to see in the city of Nashville. Although I had a great time with you, I think we‚Äôre just incompatible in terms of what we‚Äôre both looking for. I was using Tinder in hopes of finding a long-term relationship, and that‚Äôs still what I‚Äôm looking for. I‚Äôm not exactly sure what you‚Äôre looking for. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre open to one, just not with me. And that‚Äôs okay. What we did on Saturday (\*\*oral, even though it was my first time doing it\*\*) probably sent the message that I was looking for a hookup anyway, so I‚Äôm sorry if I made you think that. I don‚Äôt want to force you to be interested in me. And I feel like I was doing that when I asked you to hang out this Friday, and messaging you. Your interest in me has seemed to wane a little bit, so I think we should just part ways. I wish you good luck in Nashville, and I hope you‚Äôre able to find what you‚Äôre looking for :)

Best,

He texted later, saying: 

""If you change your mind and want to hang out again, just let me know (upside-down smiley face).""

At first, I was happy to receive this text. But the ""if you change your mind"" part has me confused. If I change my mind about wanting to do hookups? Why would he think I would change my mind about maybe doing casual sex with him? Or does he mean if I change my mind about parting ways?

I initiated the breakups with the two women I seriously dated (for different reasons). I‚Äôve been single for over a year now, and haven‚Äôt been looking. My rationale for doing so is because I feel as though I am not the best version of myself yet. While on paper I have experienced academic, professional, and social success, there are many things about myself I dislike and am working on improving. 

For example, I have been working to stop relying upon substances (like alcohol and nicotine) as a crutch when feeling anxious. I am also not confident about my body image and have been working to improve this.

While several people who I find attractive have shown interest in me, I haven‚Äôt pursued any of them because I am afraid I will emotionally hurt them because I‚Äôm so in my head about self improvement and on some level I dislike myself.

Catfish potential?

So I (age 30m) matched with (27f) on a dating app. 
I've never really dated in my life, so of course I'm fairly excited/naive/nervous in general.
Got her phone number and texted her, letting her know I'd ""give her a call sometime."" Trying to play it cool ya know.
I have a general idea of what to do to go on dates with dating app matches because of online research, but research is much different than IRL experience.

So the next night rolls around and I'm about to contact her, but she beats me to it &amp; texts me right before I could.
We begin chatting (via text) and she seems....oddly/intensely into me. I mean, we hit it off pretty good on the dating app, but phone texts were more intense.

She's responding with üòò emojis/üòçemojis and using exclamation points excessively. 
So I'm pretty happy with that, but I'm also somewhat....confused/concerned?
I know that may sound petty, but I've never had a total stranger act like that through texts.

Like, should I be concerned? 
I mean what are the odds she has delusional thoughts about me or she's catfishing?
Anyone else experience excessive flirting with someone they haven't met yet prior to meeting?

I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt and set up a date with her in a few days, but I can't shake the feeling something is up. It sounds too good to be true. She sounds real/authentic, but I'm still concerned that she's going to either look different from her pics or she has strange plans with me.

Maybe it's innocent, maybe she's just trying to seal the deal?

As the title states I (34f) am dating for the first time I'm 15 years. I left an emotionally and physically abusive marriage. I loved him so very deeply, so much so I didn't realize what was actually happening. We sign papers in a few months and its done. We separated April 2020. 

Since then I had like a little fling with a guy and it was just fun no strings attached company for us both. I would also like to point out I married the first man I dated. So my experience is only him. 

Last week I went into a pub to get a drink as my kids were with my ex. I sat down at the bar and I saw him. He smiled said hello, asked whst brought me in I said awful baby daddy. He said he had an awful baby mama, asked if I wanted to come sit with him. So I first was going to say I'm good but he was so cute and I thought why not engage in some flirting I'm not married anymore. He was sweet, kind, and respectful. Asked if I wanted his number I said yeah and he filled it in and sent a text. 

That night he messaged saying it was great meeting me. He asked if he could take me out. I said sure and we went out like 2 days later, we text the entire time. 

We went out, drank laughed talked got to know each other. He asked if I wanted to watch a movie at his place. I said I would love to. He was respectful we made out lol I felt like a teenager and it also kind of freaked me out. He's the complete opposite of what my ex was, he is someone who would be great to date, great to be around but like I'm not ready for that yet. 

Now since then we have seen each other again. Didn't sleep together, made out again. He just kept complimenting me and he was so gentle and kind. It also turns out he works with my friend. So I asked her if he's someone who sleeps around. I was also convinced he couldn't genuinely be that nice. 

I'm feeling overwhelmed. From his feelings and how into me he is (which is insane to me anyways) and now my feelings that are being formed around him. It's tripping me out and makes me want to pull completely back.

I decided to give dating apps such as bumble ,tinder and hinge a go in the hopes I can find someone I can connect with. I went out on multiple first dates that led to no where. I‚Äôm just going to list my experiences with these men to make it easier to understand.
1. First person I met on tinder I had zero experience around dating or even speaking to guys in general. At the start it was normal we were just getting to know each other after a few days he started being very sexual through text which I didn‚Äôt like I told him that but he ignored me. He started to call me while his wanking off and he started to beg me for nudes like none stop. When I said I won‚Äôt sent him nudes he hanged up the phone on me and I remember crying thinking to myself why was he treating me like that that I thought I‚Äôm not worthy enough to date. He said if I send him naked pics that he will be happy and pressured me into sending him nudes. I felt so disgusted in myself. Please keep in mind I don‚Äôt have any friends that I would tell this too and with that no prior experience with men I didn‚Äôt know any better I was stupid. He took me out on a drive at night and he parked in McDonald‚Äôs parking lot where he went on top of me and kissed me. That was my first kiss I regret it deeply I thought he cared about me. He kept pushing my boundaries and I thought because he wants to date me and I quite liked the guy. At the time he used to message me saying things like ‚Äúthings are not going to workout because you are not sending me nudes or doing anything sexual with me‚Äù which made feel like I‚Äôm not normal back then I didn‚Äôt know any better. On the second meeting he forced me to give him oral sex he finished in my mouth I wanted to pull away but he pushed my head down. That night I went home feeling worthless and I self harmed for the first time after being clean for 5 years I felt guilty for what has happened. He could constantly message me playing with my feelings promising me false hope. After months I blocked him after understood what‚Äôs going on. 
2.second guy I met on tinder was a complete weirdo. On the first date he put romantic Music and was kissing my hand the whole car ride on the first date. We had a coffee date and at the end in the parking lot he went on one knee and proposed to me to become his girlfriend. He gave me flowers and chocolate. For the first date he was a walking red flag. I went home and messaged him saying that I‚Äôm not interested he got pissed off and started insulting me calling me fat and brought up my childhood trauma saying I deserve everything that happened to me. He didn‚Äôt understand how strong he came on me it creeped me out. I blocked him straight away.
3.Third guy I met was a very quiet person and we got along really well. He was very respectful of my boundaries and was a pretty chill guy. We went out on three dates after that he started to be distanced and I started to feel suspicious. I confronted him and he made up excuses that his busy that‚Äôs why he wouldn‚Äôt call or FaceTime. He started acting very unusual from calling four times a day to nothing. Two months of arguing,crying and blaming myself for not being good enough. I made a fake Insta account and searched up his name. Turns out he been in a relationship for three years I knew from his bio. 
I confronted him and all he has to say is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know you‚Äù.  All those emotions and wasted nights talking to him went down the drain I meant nothing to him. 
4.Fourth guy I met on hinge we got along so well we shared many interests and he was so fun to be around. I liked him actually but he wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship after dragging me for months. He was still not over his ex of six years. He was emotionally unavailable. He would not talk to me for days and when I spoke up about it he said that I‚Äôm clingy. I stopped talking to him because he doesn‚Äôt put effort. 5.Fifth guy was from tinder we spoke for like a week. I told him that I don‚Äôt want to rush in getting physically intimate and I told him I‚Äôm waiting until marriage to have vaginal sex which he didn‚Äôt have a problem with. The topic came up and I wanted to let him know just in case that doesn‚Äôt suit him so he would stop talking to me. He I was supportive my Discission over the phone but when we met he wasn‚Äôt too happy when I didn‚Äôt want to take thing further. He messaged me saying he can‚Äôt be with someone who doesn‚Äôt give him sex. I told him before we even met in real life but I guess he thought that he will change my mind. I stopped talking to him straight away.

  I‚Äôve been talking to someone for a few weeks and he invited me to play video games. I counter offered with meeting at an arcade and he agreed. 

  The day before, he checked in to see if we were still good for meeting up and I said yes. Well, on the day of our meetup, he messaged me saying something came up and he couldn‚Äôt make it. He said he was sorry and maybe we could try another day. 

  I think he could have punked out and had anxiety about meeting up with someone new. I get that. But I am getting really f*cking sick and tired of being disappointed. 

  I used to be the type of person to give someone a benefit of a doubt and give them another chance. Unfortunately, I learned that only gives someone the opportunity to make you regret that choice. I‚Äôm tired of being a nice guy. 

  I was a nice guy my whole life and been the type to take action and put my heart on the line over and over again. Well, you know what? I want to be an asshole now and not give a damn about anyone else‚Äôs feeling because there is no room in this world for a nice guy to be. Im done.

I (M22) recently met someone (F23) in my building while grabbing our bikes to go on separate rides. I casually asked where she rode, she suggested a few trails, and we hit it off.¬† A few weeks later, after asking her to go on a ride, I learned that we have a lot in common. We both recently graduated college and moved to a new city. In our conversations, it became we both like a lot of the same things (music genres, art, cycling, etc.), share many of the same values, and recently left long-term relationships due to long distance. We started hanging out more often and texting regularly, and I slowly started to fall for her and it was clear she enjoyed chatting with me too. 

A few days later, I invited her to pregame with my friends at my apt. Later that night, we go out to a new club with the other pregame attendees and have a wonderful time ‚Äî buying drinks for each other, dancing like no one was watching (but not suggestively with each other), and generally enjoying each other's company. We interacted as if there was no one else was around and it was just us getting lost in each other. 

Then, all of a sudden, she turns to me and says she wants to tell me something. She tells me that she recently realized that she‚Äôs a lesbian but previously considered herself bi. Prior to this moment, we hadn‚Äôt really talked about our sexuality outside of mentioning our past partners of the opposite sex. This came as a shock to me, but it felt really special that she felt comfortable enough to share a new and personal revelation like that with me, and I told her that. We continued dancing and enjoying ourselves. We later left the group and went to a small dive bar for drinks and shared more conversation. We eventually got back to our apartment complex where she invites me up to her place to smoke. We smoke and chat until the early morning when I eventually leave. It was an incredibly memorable night. The next morning we exchange texts about how much we enjoyed the night and already started making plans to spend more time 1on1. Although I‚Äôm incredibly happy to have a wonderful new friend in a new city, I can‚Äôt help but find it difficult to let go of the strong feelings I had been developing for her. It has only been a few days so we haven‚Äôt talked more about her sexuality or why she decided to come out to me in that moment.

I looked online but it did only made me worry about things I didn't even think of before: mainly, if they are in a dedicated relationship they might miss being intimate with the other sex, so they often want an open relationship.

Open relationships are a big no for me anyway.

This guy told me right away he was bi which I really appreciate. If he didn't tell me I wouldn't have known, he is quite masculine and does not have any of those gay-ish sterotypes, like being feminine (sorry if that sounds insensitive or stupid).

I think most of his friends and some of his family know as well. I believe his last relationship was with a man and I am not sure if he ever had a relationship with a woman.

Girl looked good, felt that we matched in almost everything. It was even too strange match that we really share the same ideas. This is the first time I really felt like since my separation 1.5 years ago, that there is something new and exciting going on and that I really enjoy it.

We went for what I remember as being one of the longest first dates, 9 hours straight. It felt so good.

Next day, not so...

So next date I went to see her again, and we started talking and I started joking. I started talking about my friendship of 10 years with a female friend, and that she has issues being attracted for/dating guys that are out of law.

That's the moment when she said something like ""Are you afraid for yourself and your son because of that"". I was like seriously. I am not dating these guys, she is. In 10 years of friendship with my friend, I never ever had even one single contact with any of her guys. I was just trying to support her to move away from emotionally unavailable people.

And then she said ""**These kind of friendships are unacceptable for me that you have**"" is the sentence where I really lost interest. It broke all in just one sentence, I lost any interest in dating her and felt so sad.

Idk, where she got an idea that you should investigate every single person I have befriended with, and decide whether you are gonna date me, based on my friends personal lives. But she indeed confirmed to me that she would not be friend to someone who has friends of that kind. And it was just a casual talk, nothing that I expected to be something serious.

I am feeling confused, sad, disappointed... I really don't have an idea whether I am overreacting, but for me this really seems like a red flag.

We never discussed any rules or whatsoever, such as agreeing not to see other people - but I knew I wasn't going to anyway. He initiated the break because we weren't spending enough time together, and I wasn't doing enough for the relationship. I admit now that I wasn't there to support him through tough times and when he had his anxieties - even though he was there to support me through all of mine. We've only met up a few times in the past 6 months and I started texting him less frequently because I had my own issues to work on, and didnt want to go out so often because of covid. I admit that I definitely should have put more effort into our relationship, I didnt even show up for his 21st birthday, and there's plenty more that I should've done to be a better girlfriend overall.

Just few days ago, he came clean and confessed that he caught feelings for a coworker that just joined his workplace, 2 weeks after we went on break. He felt really guilty about it and wanted to make things right. They've gone out for after-work drinks almost every day and date-like activities (movie, art exhibition, brunches) all while we were taking a break. He's kissed her a few times, they made out and he's confessed his feelings towards her. He even got her a film camera and brought her to some fancy cinema for Christmas. He told me he would fetch her home, get her snacks at work and even give her his favorite hoodies. All in a matter of 3 weeks.

Thing is, I know he wouldn't just fuck around with any girl without actually having feelings for them. He's a virgin (if that matters) and doesn't have much experience in relationships, so I know it was more than just sex. They don't even work in the same department, which meant he went out of his way to talk to her and show interest. Also she's moving abroad in two months for uni.. so Im wondering if this is one of the reasons why he's coming back now too.

Before confessing all of this to me, he texted me regarding the issues in our relationship and I told him I was willing to fix things and spend more time together. But after hearing all of this, I don't know how to feel anymore. He wants to give me a second chance and make our relationship work this time, but after everything that's happened with him and this co-worker, I don't know how to feel anymore. Yes I realize that we never agreed upon not seeing other people during the break, but it still hurts.

I'm not sure where to go from here - should I continue working on our relationship or should I just let him go at this point? I guess someone can have feelings for two people at one time.. but if he fell for her, does he really still have feelings for me.. or am I just being delusional? I know it's my mistake for not putting in enough effort into our relationship, and not being there at times when he needed me the most. And since their relationship only lasted for 3 weeks, should I just forgive him for this?

We live in the same college town and we're both students. She asked me to pick her up and we go back to my place. We start watching a movie but ended up having sex after about 5/10 mins, initiated by her. She then starts cuddling with me, which was very nice and intimate, and go to sleep. Throughout the night we wake up and have sex three other times. The morning after we talked a little, and I asked some questions about her and she was always engaged in the conversation. I assess whether she might be interested in seeing me again by asking her if she wanted to get something to drink or eat. She nicely refused, and so I tried to keep my distance a little. I then drove her back home. When she got out of the car, her demeanor changed, and she looked at me in the eyes in silence for about 5 seconds -a long time!- with a confused/surprised expression, while I was still sitting in my car. I did not know what to do, so I stared back until I thanked her and she went back to her place. I then texted her on Tinder thanking her again and I gave her my snap. She liked my message and added me on snap.

However after this, she ghosted me, and she never responded to my texts -my follow up message was ""what are you up to?""-, or talked to me when I saw her around my college town. So I just would like to ask whether this might have to do with her just wanting a one night stand, or me being cold and distant when I dropped her off at her place, therefore the surprised expression she had when she got out of the car? If it's the latter, I would feel really bad, because I actually liked that girl and tried to keep distance only to not make her uncomfortable. Not knowing what happened made me very sad, as I wish I could have been more engaged and attentive with her. If it's the former, I might just be overthinking this.

Then i catched a cold and couldn't go to highschool 
A day later she said she decided to keep me cause she still loves me even tho relationships make her 
Kinda weak and insecure , however i told her to take more time and think of it but she said it was her desicion she aint gonna change it , about 4 days she was comlaining about bois in the class bullying her so i decided to go to school even tho i was still very sick , so i went there sat next to her but it was silent 
We were both shy ig not knowing how its gonna go now, at some point thoes bois started bullying her again and throwing school furnitures at her so i called one of them to give him a pen he just threw , then grabed him arm pulled him and slapped him... twice.
But she was like no just stop you dont have to.
Then after that clasa ended there was a 15 mim break where she pulled me away from the croud and said : 
So first of all im sorry, for hurting you , for breaking your heart ( since she always use to prank me saying she got raped or kidnapped or sick or dying etc...)

No its nothing , i replyed.
Then she said  we gotta take differents paths we gotta end this.
I replyed huh what no you said you wont cut me off 
She said i tough it trough and its the best option for both of us.
I slowely asked : so is this it ? Your leaving me now?

Yes, she relpyed.

I asked : what happend to i will love you for ever and till eternity.
She replyed : i didn't think i would fall out of love, are you gonna be fine tho im really sorry.

Couldn't speak and trying to hide tears: no its fine im gonna be just fine you can go, be happy.

i turned around to look the opposite direction, wheni felt her hand on my shoulder , she said sorry then she went back to class. 
After that day we spoke on whatsapp where i was doing all i could to just prevent that but it was usless.

At the end i told her i would change entirely since i tought it was probably my fault. 

So i changed everything ive done and reseted my phone and everything. 

After 2 weeks of not seeing her at all cuz  just stayed home i reinstalled whatsapp and when i open it seconds later she send me:
Hi 
:/
She didnt knew i still had whatsapp and she tough i blocked her , i replyed saying that i miss her , then she asker to be friends again like way before so i accepted , then we kept talking everyday as friends but yesterday she asked if i was still gonna buy her ""Pringles"" and i said yes adding that i keep promises 
A few minutes of silence after that she send me;

""Just so you yk ( even tho i didn't wanna tell you this)
