2,rmmwud,1640233179,"Uncertainty in the begging, but should i continue to explore?","long story. need help. going to try to keep concise.

last year- first couple dates were cool… i was attracted to her (me M24 her F27). we hooked up. then i started to get that paranoid feeling we didn’t click. shes very introverted compared to me. her occasional silence was typically when my anxious thoughts “not sure we click” etc came in. After about 3(4?) dates i called her and told her we should split.

fast forward a month, i realize im moving. i wind up texting her to see if she wants to get together strictly casually. we do that until i leave. i dont expect to see her again.


we keep in contact after i move. months pass. we wind up texting daily and calling every so often. she winds up coming on a vacation with me, but we agreed that would be final.


it isnt. we keep talking. long distance “talking” for a few months. we tell eachother we love eachother. i break things off with her because i dont want to become in love/commited through a virtual relationship—- (this is essentially the biggest problem/cause of stress) — its been 2 months since i ended things with her. i could buy a flight and go see her, im just terrified that those initial feelings of it “not clicking” will come right back, and therefore i will let her (and myself) down. i honestly came to lover her over text/calling, but would it be the same in person?

it makes me anxious thinking about it, but i could go see her. should i just do it? it seems like a big emotional risk for us both. i want to be responsible but i also want to love.

thank you for your thoughts.

TLDR: Attraction in the beginning, but something didn’t click. then we fell in love texting/calling long distance but im not sure that’s genuine (and if i should go see her)

I (f) have a crush on a guy that I see twice weekly at a regular activity. We have made small talk occasionally, our kids are friends, and we will continue to see each other twice weekly after the holidays

I had planned to ask him out one evening after the aforementioned activity, but he ended up not attending that night. I didn't want to lose my courage so I texted him afterwards, only to find out he had left that night on a work trip that makes him unavailable by phone except for short trips back to civilization. Haven't heard back in three weeks, so sent an IG request... Just in case? No acceptance or decline of that yet. I don't know if he's back yet or what his internet/cell service has been like. I am quite certain he wouldn't stay away over Christmas.

Seems I'm being ghosted, but I can't quite figure it out. There's no way he would have known I was going to ask him out, our kids are friends, and he's going to see me on a regular basis. If he is, it's a bit of an extreme reaction and I'm not quite sure what to do with it. If I'm genuinely confused, is it way out of line to ask him about it next time I see him? I understand that he is completely within his rights to not respond to me, but I kind of feel like I don't want to assume that given the situation. He's a very sweet, kindhearted person and we've had decent text communications in the past (re our kids). It's very out of character and a perplexing situation.

I’m genuinely curious if somebody out there has experienced something similar and how did that make you feel? 

Both experiences had a lot of commonalities:

• Both dates broke up 3-4months ago.
• Both dates were with their exes for quite some time (1.5yrs &amp; 3 yrs).
• We had an intense month of dating with intense feelings, mutual for both parties 
• We spoke freely about their exes in the relationship 
• Both exes were girls who were emotionally unstable with suicidal thoughts, reaching out to my dates for “support” randomly one day 
• Both dates broke up with me overnight citing they want to give their exes a second chance and support them 
• Both exes were residing overseas and flew to him immediately when this happened

Even though both experiences were a few years apart, this has been shocking &amp; draining for me. Especially the following few days where I am aware that he is physically with his ex, it’s heart-wrenching with a mix of feeling betrayal. 

I thought that being able to speak about their exes freely would be a good enough filter, apparently not.

So I've been talking to that girl on Instagram for about 3 or 4 months now. At first, I couldn't help but think about her all the time and was actually ready to be in a relationship.

But here's the issue, I think she had some apprehension meeting up because the first time we met was about 3 months after we've started talking because she was scared that I was a psychopath and that I would hurt her (which is normal to think about that when you meet someone online) 

And because we've taken too much time to have a first date, the feelings I've had died down and now, even though I have still some interest for her, it's clearly not enough for me to maintain a long relationship but I don't want to break her heart because I know she has feelings for me.

I think the next date, I'll be clear and will tell her that maybe we should separate, despite the fact that there's attraction.
It's selfish of me, you don't need to lecture me about it. But I don't want to date a girl to whom I'm doubtful of my feelings for.

Really funny banter back and forth and got along amazingly the two times we’ve met. The last time we met, we slept together for the first time. Dropped me off and said we should do it again sometime. 10/10 date. 

He keeps texting me, keeping the conversation going, asking me questions and whatnot. But today he took like 5-6 hours to respond the 2 times he’s initiated and kept the convo going. Which is like okay whatever you’re busy??? I guess?? The thing is is that even when I’m busy, I’ll text back relatively quickly to anybody. 

So now I’m sitting here questioning if he just wanted to sleep with me and that’s it and he’s doing the slow fade out on me? If this is the case I’d just rather not respond and just leave it at that. Or if I should just reciprocate this 6 hour per response energy back to him? Sitting here not sure what to do because we’ve texted throughout the day within seconds of each other’s texts before.

1. We met at university 
2. We’re part of the same social group and have known each other for a few months, and study the same STEM university course. We are intellectually very compatible
3. We are well acquainted friends 
4. I’m tall (6’4) and athletic (average looking though)
5. She’s short (5’2) and very overweight and below average looking 

I’ve never had any affection or interest from girls before, let alone ones I was attracted to, so I figured I should bat within my league, looks fade, and personality is what matters most. 

This girl’s friend told me she’s into me and wants to ask me out. So I just went with it, first experience ever. 

Her personality is great, she’s super duper sweet. Did the whole intimacy thing. Kissing, cuddling and sex. I just felt profoundly grossed out. There were no butterflies, no heat in my stomach, no excitement. I did not want to kiss her, I did not want to touch her. It all just felt so wrong. 


It’s the two days after now, I’m sitting in my room in my apartment questioning if I’m just a shallow bastard, or if this looks thing is something I just can’t get over, or if I’m just not appreciating what I DO have in common with her, or no chemistry, or whatnot. 


The fact is, I have realised this about myself, I can’t be with someone, no matter how awesome their personality is, if they’re not conventionally attractive. And that hurts like hell, because I’m very average myself, so I will probably never find a girl who I’m attracted to who reciprocates my attraction.

Because of that im trying to rule the clothing aspect out (or blame it all on that). The way i dress is a shirt  buttond up all the way (yes even the very top button) and pants, never jeans but those cloth like soft pants (Brown, black, blue and grey). With ankle socks and sneakers, but not those running type sneakers, i guess the best way to describe them are skate shoes. The only other thing i always wear is my samsung smartwatch. Besides that i pretty much never leave the house without a parfum and/or deodorant.

Im a pretty slim person, not really muscular. I do have my height which is 1m86 or 6,1 (i believe). Hair is pretty short on the sides with a bit more length on top. Its combed to my left with matt paste (type of wax). Not that its flat, it does have volume in it, short side part is the best way i can describe it, no facial hare and pretty smooth looking skin. Light colourd eyes both kinda hazel but its hard to define the actual colour, they seem to change with the wa the light hits. One eye defenatly has some greyish blue tint on the left side my left eye (hard to see unless you look into my eyes). But the pupil in that eye isnt centerd and my eyelids also arent simetric, not a lazy eye, but one hangs a bit lower. I think i have a long neck (which i hate). And a slim face that kinda has the shape of an egg on its head. 

I know its hard to judge this through text, but if you could maybe tell me that it might be that the way i dress is to old fashioned (im pretty much the only 21y old that always dresses like i am attending a party) or my physique or a combination. That i look stiff, not fun to hang arround with? (Shy, quiet person. Been mistaken of being gay a couple of times when im certainly not. The one girl we had in class said i was the most masculine (dressing and acting) so i dont know anymore)

I would love for people my age to comment, not that i have anything against older generations, but they mostly love the way i dress. Especially old woman, so that might be a good indicator i dress like im from the 40's or something, so does this style give the impression that i am to much of a good guy/angel (doesnt translate well to english) that never would do anything bad and is not fun to hang around with, maybe even a ""know-it-all"" look or nerdy maybe? I dont see it like that thats why i need advice on what you think

(For those intrested this is what im wearing rn, but most of my style looks like this: Gant oxford shirt perisian blue, beige jack&amp;Jones pants slightly rolled up, so that the pants fit neatly on the shoe. Lacoste g80 sneakers, but most of the times i wear my Adidas daily 3.0 black, no jewelry exept my galaxy watch 1 and azzaro the most wanted as perfume)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rmpwr3/can_the_way_a_guy_dresses_put_girls_of/
23,rmq0kr,1640243867,I have anxiety issues and my partner keeps triggering it,"
So me(18f) and my bf(20m) have been in a ldr for five months. He is impatient and mean when angry and I’m anxious and have anxiety issues. 

He has triggered me a lot intentionally or unintentionally to the point where I have been really anxious and cried my eyes out. I do get anxiety attacks every now and then out of the blue. Since we are in ldr and over the months I have told him certain things to refrain from doing as it can trigger my anxiety and I don’t fucking like being anxious. He is supportive and has been understanding and told me to visit a psychiatrist which I can’t as I live with my family and still a student who don’t work so telling my family who don’t take mental health seriously about having anxiety issues will lead to my anxiety issues becoming a joke or something they will laugh at coz Im dumb and especially my mom who will make a joke or two about my anxiety and call it a day. So, he knows it but he tried to understand well but then again one way or another he manages to trigger my anxiety very often and I feel absolutely miserable. 

Today we had a huge argument coz we were streaming an anime and we mute ourselves so we text each ither in between while we watch. He mostly don’t reply as his phone is away or he is busy being too focused on watching so I try to handle it but sometimes I get anxious and annoyed that he isn’t responding even after so much time been passed and it feels like Im watching the movie alone. I told him when he can, he should reply to my texts when watching. For more bg, he is busier in general and we don’t talk on phone coz I have strict parents so he occasionally gets busy and I have to wait for him and my anxious ass often hates waiting and I end up getting annoyed. Sometimes his Insta didn’t receive notifications so he replies back half an hour later, sometimes his phone is silent or sometimes his phone is away and he is on pc and he takes time to reply back which makes me anxious while I am waiting fir him to text but it’s nothing of a big deal to me. It’s just sometimes we had arguments when I really got anxious. He is impatient and would rather not have a conversation while angry while my anxious self wouldn’t want to be left alone.

So today I was confused about the plot so I texted him and Im also on my periods so He didn’t reply until the next episode and when he did, I was annoyed coz I was confused for the whole episode and didn’t get the story well enough then I told him he should have replied a bit sooner and he said he couldn’t coz his phone was charging so I told him I an annoyed (coz I was confused and he didn’t reply and also periods moodiness) then he stopped responding. I got so fucking anxious and annoyed over this and I lost my cool. I felt like crying. Then I keep texting him coz Im anxious and he still didn’t reply. I was telling him to reply on time but instead he stops responding and continues to watch the anime so I lashed out and I told him he made me anxious and then he decides to reply saying he didn’t get the notification and I told him that he could wait two seconds fot me to text him instead of just closing the chat and watching anime all while Im an anxious fuck. Then he was annoyed by me and I was mean to him then he told me “I don’t wanna talk to u” and disappeared. And this made me more anxious and feel worse than ever coz He always does it and when Im explaining how I feel and talking about the thing then he says “Imma go” and stops responding which has always made me anxious so I told him last time to not do it as it makes me feel so fucking horrible and if he wishes to stop talking about ut then he can say it but he shouldn’t ignore me completely and just disappear coz it triggers my anxiety. And he just did it and I was so fucking done. I mean I tell this man not to do something and he ends up doing the same exact thing. 

I fucking feel so horrible. Idk how to cope with my anxiety and I fucking feel miserable when Im anxious. I don’t expect my bf to be therapist and keep taking the hit of all my issues but Injust want him to try not to do stuff that makes me anxious even after me telling him not to. Idk what to do. He always keep doing things I tell him not to. Im fucking sick of being anxious.

31,rmrb22,1640249061,My gf (F18) says I (M16) turned her off forever. Is this actually true?,"So I've been in a pretty damn good relationship for about 2 months now and we've discussed about having sex for New Year's eve since the beginning of this month. We've been horny with each other every day pretty much, and as horny as we get, we're also wholesome and I think that's a perfect relationship, until last night when I accidentally fucked things up. We were being horny yesterday, that night I felt I was being horny too much and thought she doesn't like it if we're overreacting (what I'm trying to say I felt guilty because it looked like forcing from my perspective as she said I control her and don't even have to ask her if she wants to be horny or not). What did I do? I said ""enough is enough, sorry"" but I worded it so wrong. From that point she told me ""That was an instant turn off from now on till forever"" as well as ""I'm not gonna be horny anymore"". My heart was broken (so was hers) but I realized that she was sad and hurt about it so I went on discussing about the misunderstanding. She later told me ""I am very hurt but I do understand now what did you mean, of course I can't sustain from not being horny with you but now this malice is way stronger than me to the point of deciding there won't ever be sex before, during or after New Year's eve"". She's THAT hurt to the point of doubting in our relationship and saying ""I bet this is going to screw our relationship"". Today she went on to dry text me and tell me that we're going to talk tomorrow. She's a lovely girlfriend and we both did sweet things for each other but I strongly believe this isn't some kind of a red flag but rather a big mistake from me which, I'm afraid, cannot be fixed. That is, unless she actually ignores it and gets horny when we meet again.

P.S: To clarify, sex and being horny definitely isn't a number one thing I look for in a relationship.

TL;DR: Me and my girlfriend were horny every day, I wrote a message that was worded badly and turned her off forever. Is this true?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rmrb22/my_gf_f18_says_i_m16_turned_her_off_forever_is/

I don't want to be shallow so I have dated these guys that I personally don't find attractive but this has never worked out because I was not overly into sex with them so they cheated or left.

41,rms59n,1640252563,Social Awkwardness/Anxiety around females.," I'm a 21yoM, I have come out of the bad side in terms of confidence and socially wise. Which has affected me most of my life so far in relation to women.

**Background:** I went to various schools in my young days...which were all boys schools. A lot of my friends had interactions with girls one way or another, (Meeting them from other girls schools, or mingling with them externally), from the ages of 4-17 I on the other hand did not. I definitely had opportunities to mingle with females when I was younger but unfortunately my confidence was so low (partially because I was overweight) and I was more interested in gaming (again partially to distract myself from the issues), that I ended up never tackling the issues head on.

**How it is now:** My confidence is definitely a lot better, as I've been working out for a couple of years, and have managed to become intimate several times. As well as over the last few years, coming into a lot more contact with females. However I still seem to come into issues, which are mostly internal.

* For example: When I am really attracted to a female, I crumble on the inside. One example of this, is beautiful blue eyes. Imo on a brunette they are extremely attractive, however whenever I speak to someone who would fit this build, I would get intimidated I think. This can cause me to tense up like stage fright, and start moving very unnatural (at least for me). Or I might come across as having boring chat/being shy (which isn't the case), when in reality I've lost my thought pattern of what I want to say next, and struggle slightly for conversation.
* Also me still not being happy in my own skin yet for myself and when around females, makes me feel that if I'm not feeling good about myself, then the girls that see me walk past or talk to me will also feel the same way. Which again makes me feel like I'm a 2 rather than a 7, and keeps that confidence from rising any further then it has.

In general these kind of issues have definitely had a big impact in regards to me and females in most social settings so far, and definitely makes me act and feel a lot more awkward then it should ever be in certain situations. As I said I have managed to make improvements and have masked it on the outside kind of well for the most part, but I'm fed up of feeling like this on the inside, when I know if I was confident and not feeling socially awkward or anxious, that I would do so much better around females.

So can please I get any advice on how to combat these issues, and overcome them sooner rather than later ?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rms59n/social_awkwardnessanxiety_around_females/

47,rmsrsx,1640255178,A big what if,"Trigger warning: this piece of advice goes against all social norms and gender roles. 

All single people would have more fulfilling love lives, if she would make first and full-fedged ""move"" on anyone whom she's interested in. Be it a one off encounter or a reoccurring association. 

Most human beings come to learn as much as`fortune favors the bold` down to `another day another dollar`. As for our conundrum within our lovely society - i find and estimate a 1:1 ratio between females and males. Now you already know this, and that I've mentioned gender roles, and social norms, and even making moves! You know where im going with this, don't you?

Let me elaborate on my logic before you completely decide if this is not wise. If we can just agree that opening a door, or even walking through one allows a person to be ... somewhere. I know how vague that is but its a metaphor against both a literal instance of location and the most stereotypically engaged upon form of chivalry. Now call me a feminist, and womankind should more often than not choose a door to open; Now juxtapose that with womankind to make first moves, and with only 50% of humanity making any real assertive effort to creating love out of thin air - all together our combined likelihood of  experiencing enough love is a lot lower, dramatically lower for single persons.

Can we also agree; If half of the population isn't utilizing enough human ingenuity  (and their opposable thumbs) to  open a door and choose a date whence and wincing at their own volition. In ""layman's terms"", `to improve the chance of loving relationships blooming across society, more of womankind - must make the first move.`",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rmsrsx/a_big_what_if/

We should have gone on a 3rd date for a little over a week ago but i became sick and had to cancel. She is extremely on and talkative, and messages me a lot. Our conversations are several paragraphs long for each message exchange and it’s kinda wearing to scroll through everything and reply to it in order. I take a while to reply to it because i feel that the conversation isn’t that rewarding or interesting, and she double texts me in between sometimes which makes it even harder to keep track of this never ending conversation. She asks me how i am and how my day has been everyday. I’m already a slow/bad texter to begin with.

It is not flirty at all basically, but she has told me a couple of times when we have met that she likes me. We decided to meet again after Christmas and new years, but i’m starting to have second thoughts.

She then suggested that we could cook something together the next time, which i replied positively to.

Now it feels like i have painted myself into a corner. I’m very uncertain about how i feel for her and i don’t think i’m comfortable going home with her.

When i got sick i told her i felt bad that we couldn’t meet as planned, to which she replied something along the lines of, ”it’s totally ok as long as we actually meet in the end and you’re not just saying it.” I think she felt that this sentence sounded a little harsh or something, as she later said that she meant it more as a joke(??) I’m not exactly starting to feel it any more after this and our extremely long and repetitive texting.

There are attractive ones too, but most people are with people of comparable attractiveness, but honestly, anything can happen, I asked out a coworker who I think is super cute and she said yes. If I can do it, the guys who claim to be average-looking surely can too, tinder is shit and designed to keep you single, go out and socialize and I'm sure you'll crush it.

I was working on the birth suite today, and I saw a short below average looking guy walk in with a gorgeous woman, and I also saw a tall hot dude walk into the birth suite and the woman who was giving birth was not physically attractive.

The guy was definitely smarter and more well off than me but I thought there was definitely a vibe enough for a second date. Then I said to a friend “isn’t it interesting that the guys that like you are never the guys that you want and the guys that I want never want me?” And she mentioned that maybe I’m “shooting out of my league”

I'm just worried I'll freak out a guy on the first date.    

The strange thing is, I used to feel so strange and weird over my lack of experience. Like something was 'wrong' with me. I no longer really feel that way, because everyone is different and has their own paths. As for sexual preferences, I am drawn to dominant (?) men who are older than me. Personal interests include history, literature and travel. 

Thanks for any advice and suggestions. Oh, and Merry Christmas :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rmvm9r/27_female_never_been_kissed_or_on_a_date_looking/
63,rmvmah,1640265851,"Opinion: if you want a woman that doesn't judge you for your height, maybe focus on the ones that don't seem specially obsessed with their appearance either.","First things first I'm not a native speaker so please forgive my gramatical/spelling mistakes :')

I'm a 5'3 girl, and I've been dating a 5'4 boy for almost two years. When we were a few months in, my boyfriend asked me if I truly didn't mind his height. He had made some of jokes about it before but, honestly, I had never given them a thought. I mean, I make them too, and I'm not self conscious about my height like at all. It's not like I didn't know the fact that he was shorter than most men I knew but like. Thats it. Never had an opinion about it. But, turns out that has always been the biggest insecurity of his. Apparently, all her exes had, at some point, made a comment about it and he even, to my utter surprise (because, I mean, he truly is A CATCH) he even struggled to find dates because of it!!

Now, my boyfriend and I are very very different. We are both huge nerds and enjoy discovering weird stuff together, but while he's your typical opera-enjoyer man, who is 5/10 times dressed in a suit and watches films in French without subtitles; I'm more of your local nerdy girl obsessed with bugs and trash horror comics who literally only owns 1 bra and 1 pair of jeans. And our social circles do really really reflect this fact.

A lot of people tell me that I would look much much better if I did my makeup and wore ""fitting"" clothing, and I know that but, honestly, if I'm healthy and feel normal about my appearance, why should I spend more time on it?

I wasn't really surprised when, last sunday, when asked my group of friends about this, and they were just as surprised as me about this. None of us would have any trouble dating a men shorter than us! 

We gave it a bit more thought, and we've come to the conclusion that it might be because of this:

Haven't you noticed how buffed gym men tend to only date fit women? And would you imagine a doctor in astrophysics dating someone who only watches keeping up with the kardashians? Yes, it can happen, but people are usually going to apply what they care for in life to their dating preferences.

My point being: if you, like my boyfriend used to do, only surround yourself with women that do really care about their appearance (which is not a bad thing) odds are they are really going to care about YOUR appearance too!

If you are asking for a woman to look beyond your height, why won't you try to look for women being their makeup, clothing style etc? I know a lot of you say that you do, but then you react totally different to her when she's on a full face of makeup and a skirt. 

Again, this is just my opinion, but I hope that maybe it can help someone.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rmvmah/opinion_if_you_want_a_woman_that_doesnt_judge_you/

70,rmw22k,1640267306,I dont know what to do,"A few months ago i met this guy through mutual friends. We got along really well and we have great chemistry. We talked for like 5 hours when we first met until he kissed me. After that wehooked up a few times mostly when drunk but after the hookup we always cuddled and talked a lot.
That eventually ended since both of us had other things on our minds. Neither of us want a relationship so we were fine with just being friends. I also never really had feelings for him so i was completely happy the way it was.
Last week I had a party at my place though and he fell asleep on my couch so i let him stay the night there. In the morning he woke me up and we started talking. That day he opened up so me about a lot of issues he has and some really personal stuff (I dont think he is the person to talk about stuff like that a lot).
Two days later I invited some friends including him over before everyone left for christmas break. When everyone left that night he kind of didnt seem to want to go so I offered him that he can stay at my place over night (as a friendly gesture and not bcs I wanted to hook up ot sth). He was really happy about that. It got really late and we talked again and eventually he laid his head into my lap so i could stroke his hair. We stayed like that for a while just talking and enjoying the moment since it was really intimate in a non sexual way. He also kissed me when we got up but nothing else happened. Wejust went to bed cuddled and kissed for a while and fell asleep after.
We never really talked about that again on the next day and everything went back to normal I think. I dont know how to feel about it since I told him I would never be in a relationship with him even though that night I definitly felt something for him. He also didnt contact me since then and i dont really get why. I feel like you wouldnt just act like that with someone you dont feel anything for romantically.

However, due to the pandemic (4 of my family members are doctors) I was very depressed and anxious in the year leading up to our breakup which didn’t result in the healthiest relationship.

We attended the funeral together. 

I just got out of another relationship a couple of months ago (let’s call him X). This one was emotionally taxing and toxic. I couldn’t see that until I got out of the relationship because I had really big heart eyes for this guy in the moment.

89,rn04y6,1640279126,Broke up with my new bf over saying the n-word. Was I in the wrong?,"A few days ago I (23f) was on the phone with a guy i was newly dating P (33m). I am black and he is Latino and traveling right now with his buddies seeing some family he hasn’t seen in a while. The topic of the N-word came up in conversation and i told him I’d prefer no one who isn’t black say that word period - preferably nobody at all say that word. 
His reply was that people were too sensitive about that and then, I guess I was on speaker, his black friend he was traveling with who they ‘lovingly’ refer to as ‘Black __insert first name here___’ got on the line and said I was overreacting. I told him to respect my wishes, this shouldn’t be an argument and we’re moving on for this conversation. Then he had to hang up and call me back bc they were preparing to do something.
When he called me back he did not end the conversation and instead kept trying to talk about the n-word and how saying it varies by context or if it’s in a song. He also went on to say Black ____ said I was overreacting.
I adamantly told him he didn’t know what he was talking about and needed to stop. I’ve dealt first hand with racism all my life growing up in the south and have some traumas from it. I was very clearly getting irritated and was raising my voice. He told me he was just trying to “have an adult conversation with me” and I was acting childish. I, ngl, yelled at him he had no leg to stand on here and doesn’t need to be arguing with a black woman on why him saying the n-word under whatever context is not right and disrespectful to the black woman you supposedly want to be with. He lost reception and i said it was for the best when he texted me and would not answer his calls back.
He kept texting me saying he wanted to talk this out like adults but I was so infuriated that this conversation was still going on. I told him repeatedly over text to stop texting me and he kept going. I told him I can’t be with someone who has that belief and he kept blowing up my phone. I got mean and told him to f-off, and idgaf anymore leave me alone. He kept telling me I was being a child and to pick up the phone and be an adult about it but I was so mad I knew talking to him would only make me more upset.
I messaged him the next day and told him to enjoy the time with his family and I hope it was great.
Few days later, yesterday, he sent me a novel of an email telling me I was “23 with the mindset of a 17 year old” and “no wonder i can’t get real friendships” and was asking me if I saw the work he did with the BLM movement and how his black friends had different conversations with him. He told me I was self centered and hurled many other insults my way. It was really hurtful 
I get I may not have handled it the best loosing my temper but I feel as though I had set my boundaries and he didn’t respect him.

Once we talked about ""where we know each other from"" (after we started working together), and she said she doesn't remember any of it and then in another conversations she would recall a very specific detail (like name of person I was with) showing me that she was lying to me when she told me she doesn't remember.

This is not carrier job and to me is as important as McDonalds summer job.

I've got an idea she does not want to date a coworker, so I didn't want to push anything after asking her on a date and she told me she does not have a need to hangout with people from work after work even for a simple coffee.  
I'm usually not a type of person that gives any attention to things that can be coincidence, but something weird happened this week (last week at work before vacation) that can hardly be coincidence. After I told her what place I will be celebrating this new year at like 2 weeks ago, she 2 days ago informed me that she and her friends will be at the same bar (there are like 50 places that will have something for new year, and she picks the very same I will be at) she is going with (3 friends she is close to the point I would not be surprised if they wipe each other ass after pooping that look at her as a forever single friend).  
When I share story's on FB I always leave them public as they were that way by default, but it always had only views from people I'm friends with anyway, so I did not care. The latest story 3-4 days ago was from a bar where we will be for new year. It had exactly 3 views shown as ""other people viewed your story"" and that happens when people you are not friends with watch your story (she have 3 close friends that will be with her on new year). After she told me she is going to same place, I've checked, and she did not see the story. Now at this point I would still not care, but today we talked how that bar is usually half empty regardless of great DJ, good location, ambient and that stuff, but I told her it was crowded last weekend and show her a video of that night to what she referred I've seen that, and then corrected what she said and told me she has seen similar video on Instagram of our mutual friend. And then when I sarcastically commented I hope we won't be too close because when we already hanging out at work, we don't have to on the new year celebration she sounded very angry asking me ""and what exactly that should mean""...",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rn08if/girl_from_work_that_im_into_started_stalking_me/

I dont know if I'm boring him, but it just feels like that. It makes me feel a little insecure to see/ hear him talk about other people because with me, i always have to convince him to go out with me. Most of the time I dont feel like he needs me, and I understand. But sometimes it gets worse and I dont feel wanted even, like he could go on a day without talking to me.

93,rn0aty,1640279565,Low Interest,"My Instagram looks pretty good and 90% of hot girls and girls in general follow me back.

Then I usually reply to their story to start a convo, but it's always sooo low interest texting. I'm a great texter but they just show no interest and I feel like they don't want to talk to me most of the time...

I really struggle to find girls who are genuinely interested.  The same thing goes on on Tinder, we match, but it's just low effort from their side and I feel like I'm forcing the convo and forcing to go on a date... 

Any tips? Thanks guys",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rn0aty/low_interest/
94,rn0dui,1640279780,How to approach a girl if I think I’m short of time,"25(M) kind of introvert saw a girl in the office and we just meet each other in the cabs. Thing is I’m moving out of the company in about few weeks and might just see her(28F) 3-4 times in the cabs only.
Recently I’ve developed some feelings for her but don’t know how to express, we just talk briefly about office things 5-10 mins at a stretch.
There are 2 things on my mind:
1. Firstly is she even single? As I suspect she being 3-4 years elder to me and chatting on WhatsApp makes me think she’s already in a relationship.
2. Secondly, for me being a introvert is really hard to make sense of what to do and how to approach considering I might only see 3-4 times(that too for a hi-hello) before I move out of the current job.

This thing is kind of on my mind day and night and can’t stop thinking about her but really don’t know",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rn0dui/how_to_approach_a_girl_if_i_think_im_short_of_time/
95,rn0ef4,1640279824,Which guy would you go for? Or none at all?,"Would you date a person who you have romantic feelings for but somehow lack normal chemistry?

Guy A: Is your ex who you lost feelings for. However, after dating around you realise that he is the only guy you find comfort in, the only one who you can connect the deepest with. But he always felt like a bestfriend to you. There’s just a lack of romantic chemistry. 

Guy B: have romantic feelings but our chemistry is lacking. Felt like we vibe well but we cannot really connect on a emotional level compared to Guy A.

You find them both attractive (if it matters). Both of them treats you well. Staying friends with A and date B is not possible as A will not be friends with an ex. Its all or nothing for A.

97,rn0i26,1640280097,Am I toxic to my partner?," 

Me and my gf (both 14, both lesbian) have been dating for 4 months now. We go to the same school and even though we'd only been friends for a year, we realized that we often saw each other in the hallways and had a massive crush on each other for years. I'm very much in love with them and I'm pretty goddamn certain they are too. I've never felt so loved and safe in someone's presence and they mean the world to me. However, there's something that's been troubling me for a while now.

Let me introduce their best friend. Let's call them O. Now O has been best friends with my gf for over a year now I think. They're very close and they seem nice. But I'm so jealous of them. And I feel like a terrible person for feeling this way. The reason for this feeling was that first of all, my gf was in love with O for a very long time, but O wasn't interested in a relationship. If I wasn't aware that they were in love with them, I'd have confessed to them ages ago. It was only like 2 weeks before we started dating that they told me they got over O and I felt like I could shoot my shot. And whenever my gf hangs out with O, they seem so much happier.

O is tall (I'm tiny) and funny (I'm dry asf) and lives near my gf (I'm pretty much in a different city than them) and everything I feel insecure about. Even tho my gf swears otherwise, I feel like they feel bored with me and would rather spend their time with O (tbh this insecurity stems from my previous relationship where my gf left me for their best friend even after swearing that they couldn't think romantically about her at all). I know my gf is happy with me, but both the fact that they used to be in love with O and how they're so close makes me feel slightly uncomfy. I feel more like a third wheel between them. My gf is aware that I'm insecure about O and there's nothing either of us can do about it.

Another thing is that my gf is still friends with their ex, let's call them A. A is in the same school as us and just like O, is in the same bus as my gf. I've no problem with my gf being in contact with their ex but in this case, something feels off. As per my gf, A isn't a bad person but was a bad partner. They constantly body-shamed them and ghosted them. It's not like my gf is still particularly fond of A but it makes me feel uncomfortable because in the early stages of our relationship, they told me how A still meant so much to them and the only reason they were alive. People in their bus constantly ship A and my gf together and it makes both of us very uncomfortable.

I know my girlfriend is now in love with me and me only but I can't help but feel so possessive. The reason I'm posting this today is that on Christmas, my school is hosting a celebration and even though it's like an optional thing, my and my gf planned to go and hang out after that later, like a date. But apparently, O is coming along as well and I'm not sure how to feel about it. It's not even like I can say anything about it to my gf since O has no other friends attending and they'll be left alone. But I really wanted to have some alone time with my gf since we had planned a sleepover for months but had to cancel it. I'm so sure I'll feel left out with just O and my gf, I asked if my friends, who will also be hanging out in the same place as us, could come along. My gf said they weren't comfy with my friends but said they'll do it if that makes me feel happy and I feel so terrible. I feel like a possessive and jealous person for feeling this way about O and my gf. I feel like I don't trust them enough and like a toxic and bad partner. At the same time, I wish I could be more honest with my gf about my feeling since I'm tired of myself compromising my feelings all the time, but I can't do that since I can't distance them from their loved ones who probably make them happier than I ever could.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rn0i26/am_i_toxic_to_my_partner/
98,rn0j08,1640280164,Being tall isn’t an automatic win online dating..,"I’m 6’6 M. Mid 20s.

My current 8 matches are: 6’0, 6’2, 6’1, 5’9, 5’10, 5’8, 6,0, 5,9 (Hinge + Bumble)

I swipe right on all heights that have interesting profiles/find them attractive but I have virtually zero success at getting any matches below 5’6.

See so many people naturally assuming If you’re tall you get a constant stream of matches from everyone. I don’t think I’ve ever matched with anyone below 5’4 in a few years of on/off online dating despite a number of attempts.

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk. 

P.S, Tinder is 81% male to 19% female. This is the strongest barrier for why most guys struggle for matches imo.
