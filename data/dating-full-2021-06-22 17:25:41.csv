The situation: I moved to a new city in March, met a guy from bumble for coffee a few weeks later.

However, I mentioned during coffee that I was planning on traveling during a holiday and he texted me asking if I wanted to plan it and pushed me about it a bit so we ended up on a 10-day international holiday together a few weeks later. I said I wanted to stay in separate rooms and acted pretty platonic the whole trip because I wasn‚Äôt sure I was into him and he was attentive but didn‚Äôt push anything so nothing happened. He asked me to dinner when we got home but I was busy. We ended up on another 10-day holiday two weeks later and ended up hooking up the second night (and obviously thereafter). We had a brief discussion about it and he said he couldn‚Äôt read how I was feeling on the previous trip but he was hoping something would happen now. After that, we were obviously staying in the same room, etc for the rest of the week+ but I wouldn‚Äôt say it was super romantic. We were cuddling, etc but it kind of felt like we were siblings, idk. He‚Äôs been visiting his family in another country since this trip and we won‚Äôt see each other until mid-July when we‚Äôre traveling again as I‚Äôm leaving our city for the summer too. We‚Äôve been texting daily but nothing romantic/sexual, just like random things about our day and discussing bigger things in our lives. So basically I‚Äôm wondering - is this normal?

I barely match or get attention from black guys because they want someone thick with a booty or light skin with ""good"" hair, and everyone else wants either white girls or girls from their own race and I don't even get a second glance. I've had black guys say those things to my face. 

When going out with friends, they always get attention from men while I'll be ignored. The only difference I can see is that I'm black and they're not. I am not ugly and thought I was relatively pretty and always had pretty high self esteem, but the more I try to date the more I think maybe I'm less attractive than I thought. I don't mention it to anyone because I don't want to seem like I'm fishing for compliments.

When the kids were distanced learning, they brought back small groups of failing kids in ""cohorts."" A cohort is a class of 15 kids, and I had one for 6 months. I saw them every school day, and my job was to get them caught up for they pass. I was with the same group of 9th graders everyday.

I am ""teaching"" summer school math. My district uses long term subs to teach summer school.

I am also in the credential program at Cal State which is 2 semesters long. First one is classes and the 2nd one is your internship. I am currently living at home with parents while I knock this out.

1) I'm a substitute teacher. It's not really fair to me because I do SO much more than just sub.

2) If I say I'm a real teacher, I would be lying through my teeth since I don't have a credential.

We first met up about a month ago and everything seemed good, so we kept  seeing each other. I don't like interrogating people, but over a few dates I got the basics: job, family, what you're looking for from OLD (relationship). 

Nothing seemed off and we got along well, so I figured I'd go with the flow -- I'm normally pretty prudent when it comes to sex and like to wait, but I've recently become more relaxed in that mindset. So over the course of a month, we started to hang out once or twice a week for at least a few hours, we'd been to each other's apartments, and had sex a few times. This was definitely heading towards a relationship and was already semi-serious. 

Then he texted me on Sunday night: ""Can I talk to you about something?"" And he proceeded to tell me that he has a 7 year old son and that he doesn't like to tell people about this because it's often a dealbreaker and he's protective of his child. I wouldn't have matched with him if I knew he had a kid, and I definitely wouldn't have taken the relationship as far as I did. But a worse dealbreaker for me than dating a dad is dating a deceiver, and there's no way I could be comfortable around him ever again.

I immediately tried to end things and walk away, but he wouldn't just leave me. He begged me to let him explain, even when I told him it wouldn't make any difference and that it was selfish of him. He pleaded to tell me in person, but I refused to see him again and told him that if he really needed to, he could text me -- and even then, he begged me to actually read the text.

He sent me a very vague story about how some bad things happened when his kid was born and with the mother, but things are all good now! He promised he didn't have any more secrets...like I could ever trust that. He claimed his kid means a lot to him, but was able to convincingly pretend like he didn't even have a child. I think I'd actually be ok with dating a good, honest dad...but he definitely isn't one.

I just needed to get it off my chest. I‚Äôm 23M and after reflecting on my dating life for the last 3 years, I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I‚Äôm afraid of commitment.

I‚Äôd met a woman when I was 17 and she was 20. We flirted a bit but waited until I was 18 before being official and doing couples stuff. We were together for 3 years and it was a wild ride. Ultimately we talked about moving in with each other. Her family wouldn‚Äôt support her moving in because of my race (black). Which obviously put a strain on our relationship. I had even bought an engagement ring and planned to propose on her birthday of that year. In the end, her family gave her an ultimatum ‚Äúeither him or us‚Äù. She chose them and obviously that shattered my heart. I waited for her to come back only to find out she was dating a white man which made her family happy and that they had 2 kids together.

In 2019-2020, I tried putting myself back out there. I‚Äôd tried OLD and got some matches. But any time they hinted at a relationship, I got spooked and became distant. The ones I matched with were cute, hardworking and smart. (Also bonus points for not being racist and not having racist families). But I just couldn‚Äôt get over the fact that I got spooked when they hinted at relationships. A couple weeks ago, a close friend of mine and I were texting and she was a bit drunk. We‚Äôd flirted on and off for a while but nothing serious. One of her friends kept hearing her phone go off while they were video calling or something and asked who it was. She told me about this and asked what she should say. I could tell that she was heavily hinting that she wanted to say that we were dating. I somehow avoided the question and she went to bed like 2 hours later.

That incident is the one that opened my eyes about my issues with craving intimacy but not a committed relationship. It‚Äôs been unfair of me to act like I‚Äôve had and to expect them to not catch feelings. Since then I‚Äôve taken a step back and haven‚Äôt been doing OLD for a while (I even quit OLD in mid 2020).

We were seeing each other for about 2 months but for about 5 of those weeks, she was gone traveling. She travels a lot. 

I know she's younger and understandably, to no fault of her own, she is still trying to figure life out. She admittedly (and I see it too) on a few occassions have admitted being a bit avoidant and not knowing what she want.

Life has taught me not to pressure anyone. Heck, with repeated heartbreak, I wasn't even sure I wanted a relationship. Early on since we were so comfortable with each other, it came in discussion from her end about me and sex and whether I'm seeing others.

We decided fairly early that while we weren't serious or labeling anything, we would just focus on only sleeping and dating each other.

She just got back from her second trip which she was gone for about 3.5 weeks. She came over Saturday night. The night felt really special at first. But she shared a lot about her family drama when she visited them, lot of doubts she has in life right now, feeling like she's a mess, she needs therapy, etc. I tried to be supportive.

I get that in the past I've had codependent relationships. My job now isn't to fix anyone, but I did appreciate her vulnerability. And I'm at a point now where I try and date with authenticity and without masks. I'm always a work in progress. I do therapy myself, and even though I've come a long way, I still have my own triggers...which came up later that night.

So she lives with her sister and another girl roomate. Her sister at one point sent her a really long text, and they are all in group chat. She put her phone down and said she'd check it later. Fine, no biggie.

We ended up hooking up twice that night and it was very intimate. She's asking me if I don't want kids, we're sharing a lot about each other, etc. She was feeling pretty insecure about some stuff and I was being a gentleman about that and she showed a lot of affection/appreciation.

So we end up going to sushi, and this is where things went downhill. She talked about how she doesn't like to drink (she's said this before) but shared how in Vegas, she got hammered. I've had a history of dating women who drink a lot and who cheat and I didn't want to jump the gun, but I just asked more questions like was she at least in good company, etc. She was with her sister and felt embarassed. It happened when they all went out dancing. Her and I met dancing and both dance separate as well. So fine, something to keep an eye on but not an immediate deal breaker.

She also shared about the guy she had a brief hook up with before me. They were already friends and she blamed alcohol on why they hooked up. She said that she doesn't like losing control with alcohol (which in itself sounds like a flag). Around me, she really hasn't drank at all unless we've gone out to meet friends dancing. But 1:1, she never has.  But still seemed odd. But I challenged it saying well you must have been attracted to him to sleep with him, but that's ok (and it was before me anyhow). She asked if I'm ok that they still both message each other. I said yeah, I have girls messaging me quite a bit and I talk to a few where I've gone on bumble dates with but we decided it wouldn't go anywhere so as long as there's no lingering interest, fine.

We talked more about this and hypotheticals about boundaries and 1:1 hang outs with the opposite sex if you were to be committed, etc. We both shared the same view points that it wouldn't be appropriate in a 1:1 setting but all good if it's a group outing.

This is where it got odd. She then says, be right back, I need to check something. She goes to the bathroom with her phone. Right when she gets back, she says I am getting a call from my roommate. She never calls unless it's an emergency.

She picks up the phone, she seems super happy and she's like this:

""Hey what are you doing?"" ""Uh huh?"" You need me to be there right away? You're feeling lonely? Ok, I'll be there right away, I promise""

&amp;#x200B;

Now keep in mind, we've been intimate since we've met, been connecting quite a bit and haven't seen each other in a month. She was on that trip with this roomate and her sister. And her roomate knew she had a date (she told me).

I started feeling triggered. I've been working on just allowing myself to feel triggered. I've had issues of feeling replaced in the past, especially when an ex would bail to only find out she was banging a dude in the bar later.

I get that this girl isn't my ex. But even days later, I still feel this was a pretty disrespectful thing on her part.

So, I calmly asked: ""am I understanding this right, that this is a non-emergency situation and even after not seeing each other for a month, you're ending the date early for a roomate who feels lonely?""

Keep in mind she stayed teh night the night before our trip too. This isn't a first date situation either

So she simply responds by saying she doesn't know what to do and should she tell her she can't?

This really bothered me and I told her it simply sounds like you don't want to be here and I shouldn't even be telling her what to do.

She tried apologizing and saying I can still hangout , how can I make it up to you, etc? But in my mind, I felt like I didn't want to have her to pity me and stay because I complained about it so I told her I don't feel like hanging out anymore that evening.

We ended up breaking up because as we talked more, she felt like I didn't want her anymore and wanted her to date someone else. She did sincerely apologize the next morning and I felt like ok, it's sincere, give her another chance, but it was too late. She shared she has her own triggers too and tends to run away and when I was upset, it reminded her of her ex who stopped talking to her. So we essentially both triggered each other.

So it's basically done. And to this day, I struggle with this, feeling that in a moment, someone can go from seeming genuinely really into me and then suddenly devalued.

So here I am, on reddit, asking what you all think. Given the story at hand, how do you feel about where she stood with everything and how would you have reacted? I feel like maybe she was afraid we were getting close, or maybe our conversations were too negative or something, or maybe she wanted to go drink with the roomate, who knows. But it left me feeling pretty rejected.

And I struggle with my own indecisiveness. I'm going back to therapy on Friday to work on the trigger of feeling replaced which is a deep wound of mine. In a moment, I feel like I'm done then in another moment, if they seem remoreseful or pullilng away, I want them back. And I end up getting frustrated.

While she said that she is currently doesn't have the space for dating (as she is currently in her ""last phase of processing a breakup"") she thought that I was interesting, hence why she agreed to meet up with me (we agreed on a chill meetup).

Fast forward 2 weeks I noticed a decline in her interest and when I asked her how she is seeing this situation with me (i emphasized that I realize that she is going through stuff and that I totally can understand that if she wants to ""end"" things), she said that she currently has no space and said that she was sorry. I respected that and told her that she should take her time to heal. It's been around 3 weeks since then.

While I know that she told me her situation from the beginning, I can't help but think that I messed up somewhere which led to her, after giving me a chance with the meet up (?), realizing that it's not going to work between us. I always have that quote from this sub in my mind ""If she wanted to, she would find a way"".

Since I can't speak from experience and would love to get some objective opinion from you guys and girls. I was wondering if in that situation (after a breakup or similar), is it arrogant for me to assume that doing everything right would lead to her changing her mind? So for example if another person came into her life with whom she felt a real connection, would she may have tried to make it work? Have you ever experienced something like that, be it on the receiving or giving end?

(I know, you can't generalize peoples feelings but I am trying to get a better overview of the whole situation as I am really upset about myself about messing my only chance up)

I was told everything you could imagine; I'm perfect, I'm glad that I met you, I adore you, whatever else you can really think of. Along with that, they also were so affectionate and always wanted to be around me. 

But when the topic of ""relationship"" comes up they have a complete change in heart and are very adamant about not wanting a relationship even though they have been doing everything that is associated with one. This includes going on dates, PDA, intimate sex, introducing me to friends, you name it. One girl even introduced me to her parents before but we were just ""friends"" to them.

I really want a relationship. In my high school years, I did not have a single sexual experience, didn't have a girlfriend of any kind, and only had my first kiss. Not because I couldn't do it, but because I just didn't see the appeal in meaningless sex. I was raised on the idea that sex is to be done with somebody you have affection for. 

I'm just curious to hear what other people have to say about this kind of behavior. I thought that with the first girl, that it was just her, but after the girl I'm talking to said she isn't looking for anything serious even though we both suit each other so well is making me lose hope.

1.) She is very inexperienced with dating. In fact, she lost her virginity to me after we ended up sleeping with each other this past Saturday. She is also quite introverted.
2.) On our second date, she actually offered to split the bill. I declined, but really appreciated the gesture. Note that this was the only time she offered to split the bill.
3.) I really like to read, so the last time we saw each other, she surprised me with a book that she bought off of Amazon. This actually made me incredibly happy and convinced me that I should keep seeing her, as it definitely shows gratitude on her side.

As I typed out these reasons, I realize that I might just be overthinking and/or asking for too much.

Hi guys. So, my ex M (24) and i were on and off for almost three years and we‚Äôre friends for quite a long time. We met each other when were in kindergarten, drifted apart since we didn‚Äôt go to school together and finally met each other again in college. So fast forward to it, both of us were really immature at the time and wanted the relationship to be a success for whatever reason but we lack the maturity of it (we were LDR and barely see each other), he on the other hand was not a romantic guy and couldn‚Äôt communicate effectively. He was cold but would eventually say he loves me. It wasn‚Äôt a typical relationship. We never got each other anything. We eventually broke up as it wasn‚Äôt working. We continued to block each other and no contact for about two years as we didn‚Äôt end the relationship in a good manner. During the two years of no contact he once sent a follow request on my ig to which I accepted, he later unfollowed me again but I didn‚Äôt mind. Two years after, i sent him a follow request to which he accepted, he unfollowed me again but dm‚Äôd me after few days apologising saying that he was shocked that i have requested him. He also said he hasn‚Äôt gotten over me yet and that boys takes longer than girls. He told me he has dated other people but there‚Äôs something different about me. He says sometimes he likes me and sometimes he wants to move on. He is currently single and says he is not looking for love rn and I completely understand and respect that. He said maybe we could end up someday with us being more mature. We are now in good terms, not talking much. Taking life slow. I didn‚Äôt send him a request in hopes of getting back with him. He says he likes that i am a dominating woman &amp; knows when to dominate, not sure if that is a good thing or not, he says it‚Äôs good. Now my question is, does my ex still has feelings for me?

I have matched this guy on Tinder in Korea and we clicked very well, he was perfect in everything. He is not Korean, he is American and he told me he is 40 years old, on a SOFA visa, never married, no kids. 
Absolutely everything was perfect these 2 months of dating. Then last Friday I find out he lied to me about his b-day day and I started getting suspicious. 
This Monday, my friend and I started doing some digging on Google and besides multiple Instagram accounts and Twitter accounts, we discovered that he is actually 45 years old, on an F visa (marriage visa), married and with 2 kids. 
We discussed to marry together but my whole world just crashed down when I found this.
Long story short, he told me he actually applied for divorce and right now I'm waiting for him to get home to show me the papers. 
He also showed me that his wife is abusive towards him and the kids so I believe him.
But what really puts me down is all the lies from the beginning till the end.
He has a tattoo with his 2 kids on the arm and he told me those kids are just casualties from the combat when he ordered mortar on them. He has a tattoo with his wife and he said she is a manga character and I believed him. 
What shall I do after I see the divorce papers? 
Shall I continue and help him get over these years of abuse and make a family on our own or shall I just stop seeing him because he lied so much?

Enjoying the dating life so far 

So after a wedding on a Friday, the wedding party went to a bar near by the grooms house. I arrived first and went up to get some drinks. Gorgeous bartender comes up and I could have sworn she checked me out but I never know if girls actually dig me or not so I just let it go. When she came back with my drink, I could have sworn she did it again. As she walked away. The groom‚Äôs sister sitting next to me says ‚Äúthat bartender just eyed f*cked the shit out of you!‚Äù Confirming what I originally thought twice. 

The night goes on, shot after shot after shot and I‚Äôm feeling pretty toasty. Towards the end of the night the grooms sister encourages me to ask for the bartenders number. I usually find it pretty lame to be bothering people at work with that kind of shit but the grooms sister asks the Bartender while I‚Äôm sitting next to her ‚Äúare you single?‚Äù Bartender replied ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very single!‚Äù 

I‚Äôm like oh shit here‚Äôs my chance and I ask the bartender for her number. Bartender tells me ‚Äúyou f*cked up, didn‚Äôt even ask for my name but you‚Äôre going to ask for my number?‚Äù Yeah that‚Äôs a valid point and I agree with her laughing. She tells me ‚Äúif you come back up her another day I‚Äôll give it to you‚Äù 

You bet your ass I was coming back up for that number. I really respected the way she handled the situation and herself. This girl gave off some really solid vibes that I was digging and not to mention she is a total smoke show. (Personality always takes priority over looks for me)

That following Thursday, I went up to the bar asking for her and another bartender told me she wasn‚Äôt there but will be tomorrow. The groom from the wedding and another buddy of mine go up there Friday and she‚Äôs there‚Äôs but the bar is packed, 1 hour wait. I‚Äôm not going to ask for a number in that situation so we leave with the intentions of coming back. Grab drinks and food somewhere else and go back to the bar. Great! She‚Äôs not there. 

Well, my pals and I are walking distance from where we are staying so we get after it. I‚Äôm not much of a drinker but that night I was putting the shots away like there was no liquor in them. Next thing you know I‚Äôm looking around with that one eye open kind of drunk. That bartender who I talked to Thursday comes up to me and asks if I was the one asking for her friend the night before and I reply, yes. Shit you not, about 30 minutes later, the girl I‚Äôm after shows up. I cannot say if it was because of me or not and she was with friends. I DID NOT GO SPEAK TO HER. I didn‚Äôt want to make a fool of myself drunk as hell and prefer to handle my business soberly. Peaced out of there!

That next Friday I go up to the bar and it‚Äôs packed again, I said f*ck it. I‚Äôm getting this done tonight, not coming back up here again empty handed. I see her and I squeeze between two dudes so I can grab a drink. Her bartender friend comes up to me and I ask her if she can have her friend wait on me and her friend knew what was up. It‚Äôs time!!! 

She comes up acting like she doesn‚Äôt know who I am, I order my drink and she comes back with it asking ‚Äúyou were here two weeks ago asking for my number?‚Äù And I replied with ‚Äúyes, that was me and you said I could have it if I came back up here.‚Äù 

We bullshit for a second and then she starts to write out her number and pushes it to me. I pushed back her number and slid her my business card (probably lame as hell, idk what I was thinking) and I said to her ‚Äúlisten, I‚Äôm coming up to your place of work. I‚Äôd feel more comfortable if you had my information and I hope you reach out to me. I really like your vibes and would like to get to know you better‚Äù she takes the card and puts in her little phone wallet and I tell her I‚Äôm ready for my tab. I sign the tab and as I‚Äôm about to leave she comes out from behind the bar and gives me a hug.... damn did that catch me off guard! I didn‚Äôt think women hugged random dudes that were asking for their number. That went way better than I ever expected. 

Anyways, that was Friday night and I haven‚Äôt heard shit back yet as I‚Äôm writing this out Tuesday night? I could have sworn I would have by now. Because I‚Äôm so new to the whole dating world. Just was curious of anyone‚Äôs opinion if I‚Äôm being impatient or possibly misreading some of the signs? Granted this is my side of the story, she could think I‚Äôm a creep and rightfully so at this point lol. 

If she doesn‚Äôt hug me goodbye I don‚Äôt think my mind is so caught up in this but I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I want to hear from this girl. I‚Äôm feeling a connection but maybes it‚Äôs one sided.

We took a mini break because he was overwhelmed with work and wanted to take a break where we could do whatever we wanted.

Well, the break lasted maybe a month or so before he came back saying he really needed someone like me in his life blah blah. We have decided to give it another chance. We went back to talking everyday.

We are long distance, but we managed to see each other every few weekends and via Skype. He said he‚Äôs not ready to be in a relationship yet because he can‚Äôt commit to the effort and time. 

A few days ago, I saw him active on the dating app because I went on to unsubscribe since I was getting charged out the ass. I confronted him about it and he told me he got a match from when he was on there while we were on a break so he went to look. I assumed he was lying so I told him that he‚Äôs a 30 yo grown ass man now and literally everything he does at this point is a choice.

I told him I don‚Äôt appreciate him going on the dating apps but he keeps claiming that he hasn‚Äôt swiped since we started talking again. He also threw in my face that we aren‚Äôt exclusive and until we are in a relationship, I‚Äôm allowed to do as I please. 

This completely threw me off guard because I thought we were already exclusive based off the way we interacted with each other. His family knows about me, I‚Äôve met his friends, etc.

Within the 5 months we‚Äôve known each other, we‚Äôve only had sex once so I know he isn‚Äôt just interested in that. I‚Äôm pretty confused as to where I stand. He‚Äôs told me that he wants to be with me, he tells me things like he‚Äôs always going to try to keep me happy, etc., but I‚Äôm not sure why he threw in my face that we aren‚Äôt exclusive.

We‚Äôre spending this weekend at his best friend‚Äôs house who lived in another city with his girlfriend, neither of whom I‚Äôve met before.

I asked him tonight if he thought that me going with him to meet his friends is the right thing to do right now, and he responded saying he wants me to come and that if I don‚Äôt feel comfortable meeting his friends yet then he understands.

About a month or so ago a couple of friends and I popped into our local bar. Within minutes this new server approaches me and strikes up a conversation with me by asking about my tattoos, I engaged her and had a pleasant conversation, she even bought me a few drinks during her shift. As she finished up her shift, I offered to buy her a drink and she accepted. Shortly after she decided to leave work for the night. I asked for her number and she told me she was ‚Äúseeing someone.‚Äù Totally fine, not a problem and I wished her a good night. 

A few days after that night, I had to go away for work for about 3 weeks. I‚Äôve been home for about a week now and my friends and I decided to go back to that bar - surprise, that same cute server is working again. My friends and I were having a good time and I didn‚Äôt really pay much attention to her until about an hour later she came over and made it a point to say hello and give me a hug. After that, I spent a good amount of time flirting and having great conversations, she even stayed about an hour and a half after her shift to talk with me. 

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs got me confused:

As the bar was closing, shes getting ready to leave and invites me to come in on Saturday to visit her at work. I told her that I‚Äôll unfortunately be away on work again as I leave this week. Instead, I said ‚Äútake my number, maybe we can work something out when I get home.‚Äù She happily took out her phone and added my number, gives me a big hug then leaves the bar. As she walked to her car, I went to the bar to order a drink, and immediately get a text from her - faster than I expected. 

I texted back, said ‚Äúhey, that was fast‚Äù and we proceeded to exchange a few messages back and forth until she stopped replying. It was late at this point, probably around 12:45 am and I had just assumed she fell asleep, totally fine, understandable. 

It‚Äôs been a few days now, and I‚Äôve yet to hear from her. I‚Äôm not upset or anything, I‚Äôm just confused. 

Why even text me at all?
