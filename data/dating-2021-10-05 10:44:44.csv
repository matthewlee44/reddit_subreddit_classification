1,q1z67a,1633448795,My dates never turn out good in the long term and I'm stuck hooking up with people,"I'm a pretty extroverted enfp 22 yr old male and go out on dates with men and women quite often. I also HATE hookup culture as I was steeped in it with grindr and tinder. But one thing I'm noticing a lot now is that it seems people enjoy me for my energy and presence over my personality. Generally I start off pretty strong and feel like there's a connection and that they're interested in me but things start to taper off after a month into pseudo relationships where I inevitably feel like people are using me for affection rather than an actual relationship. This has put a bad taste in my mouth in regards to dating culture and I feel like I'm inching back to my old behaviors which I don't particularly like. Does anyone have advice on how to build stronger connections or is this something I keep having to force until it works.

2,q1z6nw,1633448835,How to break up with someone that won't let me.,"I have been dating a man that is very kind, caring and romantic. I have never been in a relationship when I feel so secure that he wouldn't cheat and that he loves me. Also he and I are so good at communicating, no yelling just hearing each other out and mostly figuring things out. 

We fell hard and fast for each other but as I learned more about him I've realized there are some things I don't see in him that I want in a future husband. These things though are things like common sense (not the typical common sense stuff) and desire to learn. I feel like if I explained this to him it might be rude. 

Any time him and I get in a fight he tells me how scared he is I'm going to break up with him and how ive made him a better person and I'm all he ever wants. Making it feel impossible to break up with him. 

Please help give me guidance on how to go about it and what to say. I really do love him and care for him but I think more so as a friend.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q1z6nw/how_to_break_up_with_someone_that_wont_let_me/
3,q1z7ys,1633448943,Dating for me is rubbish so I wrote this poem to describe my experience.,"I’m a 34f who has been dating for a good few months, been on many dates and had a fair few experiences with people that seem to all start and end the same way, the only difference is people use different words but the outcome is always the same. It tends to start really well, good communication, excitement, great dates, amazing sex, and then complications in people’s feelings, thoughts, what they want, (which seems to change from the initial what do you want discussions when we first meet), and then seems to end abruptly and then we don’t talk anymore... Anyway, I wrote a poem and I think it’s relatable, so thought I would share here as well as on a poetry sub. Open to discussions about similar experiences if you relate or understand what I mean, or why it might be happening. 

Here it is... 

Dating Life

Closed down, withdrawn,
Fucked off, love torn,
Step back, stand tall,
Keep moving, don’t fall.
 
Hold on, keep up,
Rush around, always fuck,
Come back, go away,
Cuddle up, don’t stay.
 
Come together, push apart,
Shut off, open hearts,
Fuck around, stop start,
Live life, making marks.
 
Sitting on, dick throne,
Laid back, prone bone,
Cuppa tea, nice chat,
Lost time, don’t match.
 
Stay awake, all night,
Never listen, alright,
Loves high, one minute,
Touching souls, don’t limit.
 
Ring fenced, blinded eyes,
Pure sense, mesmerised,
Lost minds, sex freaks,
Next minute, don’t speak.

4,q1za56,1633449122,Did I get friendzoned?,"My situation is a bit complicated. I've been texting with a girl for 2 months every day, we discussed and talked REALLY a lot, and most of the times she was the one who started the conversations. Lately we had a couple of dates, and last week I decided to tell her that I liked her. She answered that she cared for me, but she wasn't ready for a relationship and she had to think about it, since in the moment she had some problems in her life.

At first I thought that she had friendzoned me, however after that day, she started texting me a lot again (and she answers at my message in seconds or minutes), for example telling me ""Good morning"" or ""Good night"", and telling me sometimes that she's still thinking about it. However at the moment she doesn't want to have any other dates.

Also she's very shy.

I told him I thought he was cute about a week ago and he said thanks and that was sweet, so I assumed he wasn’t interested (it didn’t go anywhere, so what was I supposed to think?). But he still walks me home, engages in conversation/initiates conversations, and gives me compliments all the time. 

He might just be the type to do this with all the girls, but I mean, last week he went to great lengths to have me as a partner in class and Idk how to interpret that anymore. I try to flirt with him and it goes nowhere/seems like he’s not interested. But then he goes out of his way for me, and I don’t know what to think.

9,q200dr,1633451203,To those struggling with their appearance and how it affects their romantic life - I offer a familiar analogy.,"If dating is like fishing, then I believe the following to be true. Our appearance is like a fly on a line - each fish is going to have its preference in size, style, presentation, etc., but there is no one fly that will catch all fish. Obviously, the quality of the fly - how well it is crafted - will have an impact on how many fish will rise for it, but even a well used and damaged fly will still catch quality fish. Hooking a catch is only part of the fight after all. Even the most beautiful fly, will fail to bring fish home if it is attached to a weak line with shoddy knots. The line is our personality and the knots our experiences - together our wisdom. Are we strong, resilient, and prepared to cast out time and time again until we are successful? At the end of the line is the person controlling the rod and who crafted the fly. This is really the most important part of the equation, because it is where the choices are made. The perfect set-up will not make up for a lack of a prudent plan. Everything could be right, but you are fishing in the wrong spot, or at the wrong time or not fishing when conditions are ideal. The person also controls how to deploy the fly and line - sometimes giving sometimes taking - but always thinking. This is how we must approach dating if we want to be successful. It must be mindful, patient and diligent - and your looks are only one aspect, but if you master the craft, what you might lack in one part of your life can be more than overcome and you can be very successful.

I just feel like I dont really have anyone to talk to about this in my real life. This guy (27) who I thought was rly cute asked me out. I (22F) said yes and we met up for a drink the next night. The date was okay… it was a little awkward. I wasnt sure what to ask since I didnt want to ask the generic questions. I also didnt want to pry too much. I know I was awkward and maybe even boring. I had trouble figuring out how to talk to him. He kinda would say “nothing matters” and he kinda spaced out a little. I felt like i couldnt really carry a conversation. He pretty much would just say “nothing rly matters and we have no purpose” so it was hard to keep the conversation going. It was confusing because he seemed smart but also kinda weird. We ended up fooling around and we wanted to have sex but I couldnt since I had just started my period. Afterwards we tried to go out to eat but didnt find a place so he took me to my car and we kissed goodbye. I messaged him when I got home thanking him for taking me out and saying we should “make out again sometime”. Anyway I had a lot of fun fooling around with him but he never texted me after. I messaged him like 2 days later but never got a reply. Honestly I dont want a relationship right now I just want someone to hook up with. Anyway I dont really know how to proceed. I want to just fool around with him nothing serious. I have no idea how to do this honestly I just got out of a 7 year relationship with my high school sweetheart and am new to dating.

22,q21eyi,1633455348,How do you get over making someone that you really liked and who really liked you lose all their feelings for you?,"2 years ago, I started talking to this guy on tinder. He wasn't really my type but I decided to swipe on him anyway and we matched. We started talking and we went on a date after about a week. We lived an hour away from each other and he said that he usually doesn't drive an hour to meet someone, and that he didn't think he'd consider dating someone because he just got out of a 2 year long relationship recently, but that there was just something about me. We also made out a few times, and we were flirting and stuff.

We kept texting for about a week after the date. He told me that he was obsessed with me and falling for me, and that he could see himself spending his life with me, and that he might be my perfect match. I've never been in a relationship before and only went on 4 dates total in my life, so I've never had someone say those things to me before, especially not someone so attractive and talented at everything.

We had a disagreement and he said that it seemed like I wasn't sure if I wanted to be with him, and he couldn't be with someone who wasn't sure if they wanted to be with him. I sent a bunch of messages asking him to reconsider, and he said that I was acting crazy and that I made him lose all of the feelings that he had for me, and that he'd have to have sex with me to see if he could get the feelings back. I didn't want to have sex with him so soon, after one date and a few weeks of knowing him, so we went our separate ways.

This was 2 years ago and I've gone on 4 dates since then, but I still think about him sometimes, and I haven't met someone since that I had such chemistry with, someone who felt the way he did about me. It still upsets me that I had such an attractive, talented guy falling for me and then I ruined it by making him lose those feelings for me and wouldn't let him see if he could get them back.

I've came to the conclusion that all these apps, Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, Thursday &amp;  everything else I missed is just a scam. I'm an attractive male, living in NYC and it makes no sense (for any person really - man or women) to  not get any matches or much interaction living in  city with millions of people.

Nowadays you can go weeks / months with barely getting any at all.

I guess this is a rant/question but honestly are there apps that actually care about people building relationships or are they all in for the money?

lmao even when you pay for the ""premiums"" you still get the same results - there has to be some type of manipulation.

27,q21qxv,1633456347,"Why did he disrespect me so bad at the end of our ""relationship""?","So there was this guy (Caleb, fake name) i had met on tinder and for a few months we had been hooking up. I'm F and we were both 19 throughout this. Context of the nature of our relationship: Neither of us were looking for a relationship and we had a strict relationship policy. What i look for in a hookup is pretty much friends with benefits. I want to actually be able to enjoy time together, i work a lot and sex for only sex is hard for me to get into even if i did have time to arrange that kind of hookup. I took him out to eat a few times and paid for it, basically dates except more of a sex thing. So what we had going did look kind of close to a relationship, as one of my male friends pointed out (my roommate and i have overlapping friend groups and for awhile Caleb was over all the time so he met a lot of the new friends i have in the city i recently moved into). But i did not want a relationship, for many reasons, with this dude in particular. he really is not ambitious, and i enjoy listening to him talk but he hyper focuses on really uninteresting things and also has a tendency to mansplain really simple stuff. Nothing so over the top that i was uninterested entirely, as he would respond well when i called him out about mansplaining etc. So at the beginning we are hooking up and hanging out frequently, he has even met my brother and his friends while they were visiting and was there when my bro smoked weed for the first time ever, a moment important to me as a stoner big sis. The first weeks of us hanging out Caleb would offhandedly mention that he told his parents about me (he lives with his, i live in an apartment with a roommate) and i pointed out his behavior was looking like he wanted a relationship. He said he wasn't treating me any different than other girls he would hook up with. (he is pan with a lot of experience and pretty kinky) and i trusted that. However the general consensus with my friends was that he was my bitch. He did a lot for me in terms of what i value, he would meet me at work so i could hit a bowl before i went home, would rarely hesitate to get up and grab something for me, etc. Small things that overall i realize aren't amazing effort but in the moment i know it does take effort.

Well, we both got pretty busy with life (he works for his parents' business and community college classes started for him) and what was once a nearly every day thing turned into about once a week, sometimes more but pretty consistent schedule. Then a few weeks went by of us not talking except snap streaks (ik i hate our generation and i hate participating in this but it's how i keep in touch with many people who actually mean a lot to me, but yeah just the snapping empty face pics back and forth throughout the day). He turned me down when i asked him to come over a few times, and he finally told me that he was thinking about getting serious with the one other girl he'd been fucking. I asked if we were going to hang out again or if this was it, and he said ""he was for sure going to get serious with her but we could still hang out for now"". Neither of us are trying to have me mess with his new relationship, but he hadn't told her about his feelings yet, and couldn't tell me when he was planning on doing that. So another week passes of not actually talking and i ask why he is ghosting me. he says he's not, i ask to pick up my plants which had been at his house for a few months from when i had gone on vacation. on that particular day i was extremely depressed, did not want to be alone. i had wanted to make him be the one to initiate hanging out because he had been rejecting me every time i tried, but that day i really just wanted to be held. when i got there we smoked and fucked and fell asleep and then i put my plants in my car. he wasn't expecting me to want to stay the night and i knew he didn't want me to but that day was a really low point and i begged him to let me stay because i didn't want to be alone and told him i would stay on the other side of the bed, his whole thing was that he did want to sleep alone that night. So we go to bed and he fucks me again and when we're done i'm close but not touching him and he tells me ""scooch"" pretty much as far way from him as possible. i should've just left but he lives kinda far. he fucked me again in the morning and i left. that shit hurt so bad. he was a complete asshole but i also put myself in that situation by imposing myself on someone who obviously didn't want to spend time with me. what hurt the most is he looked in my eyes and i know i looked so fucking dead inside that day but he didn't care. the way the dynamic was before i know he actually cared about my feelings but it was just turned off and he was all of a sudden okay with treating me like shit. i even texted later against my better judgement asking if he was okay (him and his friends do harder drugs and he is prepping to take dmt and that kind of shit can affect how you treat other people if it starts messing with you) or if it was just the other girl. he confessed he had just lost interest and wasn't really into the sex that night. i told him that it wasn't even what i needed from him, i just needed his company. i knew when i went that that would probably be the last time i saw him because the plants were just kind of a loose string. i got any sex videos he had of us and we haven't seen each other since. we stopped snapping and it's been about 3 weeks but he still texted ""happy birthday nerd"" on my birthday. 

my whole thing is, i am not upset he found some other girl, i really do not want to date him and i'm not trying to keep him hostage in a half hookup/relationship thing, i know i can't expect loyalty and i don't. We had both been honest about how many other people we were seeing. I am okay with this thing ending just not in this way. What I am upset about, and i told him when he first finally fessed up about his feelings for the other girl, before everything else continued to drag on for a few weeks, is that he didn't tell me until i pressed him about it. If the situation were reversed, i would have expressed to him that our ""thing"" would likely be ending soon the moment i had caught interest in someone in a way that may go beyond sex.

One theory i have, spurred by my roommate insisting he was really into me at the beginning is that he really was kind of looking for a relationship and being stuck in the fwb got unfulfilling for him, this girl is willing to go for a relationship with him and he has moved on, doesn't care anymore about me in any capacity and i have to deal with that. On the other hand, what if he was taking advantage of me the whole time? He never took me out even when his money issues started straightening out, even though he said he would before. He could be a narcissist who enjoys playing with emotions. He would talk about how girls pine after him once they stop fucking and that was a red flag but i ignored it because again, i wasn't looking for a relationship and even though we would ""hang out"" we never hung out without having sex. It was a sex-based relationship, and i had to be the one to call out that fact that it wasn't the same. He would have just kept stringing me along for as long as possible with as little interaction as possible, i think, like a backup option. Honestly, i would've been okay with being ""backup"" if it didn't work out with her, but not anymore because of the way he disrespected me in the way it ended. He had basically told me he didn't have time to give her the attention she needed and also entertain me, that he wasn't a sex machine. THAT IS NOT WHAT I EXPECT, I ACTUALLY VALUE YOUR TIME JUST AT THE SAME TIME WHEN WE DO SET ASIDE TIME TO MEET UP THE NATURE OF OUR RELATIONSHIP IS THAT WE ARE FUCKING, IF THATS NOT WHAT YOU WANT JUST LET ME KNOW. 

Basically, i know not all of these can be answered but i would like a male perspective on some of this and also i know you ladies would have some experience with this more than my friends do. My questions are:

Does it seem like he was playing me the whole time to boost his ego? Or did I make a mistake in believing we wanted the same thing and accidentally pushed him away by being oblivious that he actually liked me? Am i crazy for expecting the level of communication i expect in a casual relationship? Was I an asshole maybe because it seems like i made him feel like i only valued the sex? 

tl;dr:
my fwb/hookup/situationship ended because he is getting serious with another girl, i feel disrespected by the way he ended things (by basically having no effort in maintaining anything until i ended it) and am trying to figure out if he stopped caring about my feelings at the time he gained interest in the girl, or if he didn't value them the whole time.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q21qxv/why_did_he_disrespect_me_so_bad_at_the_end_of_our/

1. I see so many never married men in LA on OLD. 
2. I also find several divorced men with no kids

I gone on a ton of first dates, gotten 4 short relationships, and a number of sexual partners. Thing is, I can't seem to meet someone I truly like. I just feel like it becomes a job more than a relationship. I think back to some of my friendships (M and F) through life and I know what it's like to be 100% myself around people I truly enjoy. A common occurrence is that I show enthusiasm readily, but enthusiasm does not equal a connection. Although people excite me, it takes a long time for me to form an emotional connection. In my head the relationship should start off more like exclusive friends with benefits. Is this wrong? I've been criticized in the past for being cold in the presentation of my emotions. I'm tired of going through the same cycle. This gets me to my point:

Is being honest about what I want and what I like too much in a profile? Something like ""I love trying new foods and drinks. Show me a place with drinks and a view and Ill give you a genuine smile. I'm happy to go for a hike or ride a bike with you on Saturday, but on Sunday I'll want to kick back on a couch and binge watch a show or play a co-op game. Maybe cook a tasty meal. I show enthusiasm readily but take time to form an emotional bond, so I want time together but appreciate time apart.

He’s been great and I really love our relationship except for when I need to talk about something that’s bothering me. It’s usually just small things that come up and I will tell him what is bothering me and that it makes me upset or annoyed. What I want is to actually talk about it and address it so I feel better but all he usually does is just say he’s sorry and that’s it. I will make more comments about the topic hoping he will say more but then he just sits there in silence and I have to wait for him to talk which he never does. So I’ll have to keep telling him to say something and then he will say he has nothing else to say basically other than that he’s sorry and I’m right. This bothers me a lot because it makes me feel like he doesn’t care and just says sorry as an automated response and wants it to be over after that.

I’ve told him several times now that if he needs to think about what to say that I need him to say that out loud to me so I’m not sitting there waiting like an idiot. I just need him to say *something*, and he says he will but then it comes up again and he still doesn’t do anything differently. This has been getting to me more and more lately. It happened again last night. I told him I was annoyed about something, he said sorry, I clearly wanted to talk more about it, but then instead of continuing the conversation with me he actually started playing a game on his switch. Playing a game when I’m trying to talk to him about something that bothers me made me feel incredibly disrespected and angry, I snapped at him and he apologized and said sorry and it wouldn’t happen again but I’m just so mad. I don’t know what to do about this situation. I can’t continue with our relationship if this is how it’s going to be every time we need to communicate about issues.

I feel cared about outside of this and I know he’s serious about me. He wants me to move in with him already and I’m already close with his good friends.

She made sure to tell me that I was a great guy and she wishes me all the best. This happened last Friday night and I’m wondering if I should still pursue her later on. 

My mind is running wild on what was missing for the “spark” she is looking for. All of our dates were out in public and we didn’t have much opportunity to get close physically except for quick kisses hello and making out like teenagers in the car to say goodbye. I never got a chance to spend a night in with her where we had some privacy so that could be it. The other thing That stuck out was her saying “we should see other people.” Is this a subtle way of saying I’ve met someone else? Other than that I think that we got along great, had lots of laughs, and she seemed to enjoy the time we spent together. 

I text her Friday night respecting her decision and told her that I know that she will make someone really happy. I ended with saying that I hope she finds what she is looking for and best of luck. Now that a few days have passed, I still see her viewing my Instagram stories every day. I’m not a pushy person or a jealous guy in the slightest so I’m glad that she is cool with still keeping up with each other, but am I being naive and missing some key clues that she wants me to chase her?

57,q234is,1633460623,"How can I [23f], a hopeless romantic, get over the fact no one has ever shown interest in me outside of a dating app?","I apologise in advance if this comes across as a very self-pitying and bitter post, but to be honest I guess it is and I'm looking for advice on how to pull myself together and get over my negative thoughts - because recently they've been consuming me.

I'm a 23-year-old female and until May this year, no-one had ever shown a smidge of interest in me romantically. I went through school and four years of university without ever kissing anyone or even flirting with anyone. The closest I got is confessing to one of my good male friends that I fancied him and he said he didn't feel the same.

Of course, I understand I am not entitled to anyone/any attention (and I should point out me and my crush are still friends). But it's also natural that I crave a relationship/love/sex like the majority of other human beings and I just feel like I'm missing out on this huge part of life that seems to come so easily to everyone around me. 

That's really the key to all this - it seems to come so naturally to everyone around me and truthfully I feel a lot of resentment. All my female friends in university had men express interest in them/approach them etc, while I was the odd one out and just tried to suppress my feelings of inadequacy.

I'm not going to lie - I'm a little shy and do have low self-esteem, so I think that affected my experience in terms of meeting guys in uni to a degree. But it's weird because my friends are the same, some even shyer, more anti-social and less chatty than me, but still received attention and had that quintessential 'uni experience'. I just don't get it. There's also the possibility they're just more attractive than me - I was a little overweight (not by much) in uni admittedly, but it makes me feel sad to think that was the sole reason.

Anyway, since graduating from uni last year, I decided to take charge and joined dating apps to try and catch up. I've had my first kiss, had sex etc, and men have shown interest in me. But deep down I'm a hopeless romantic, so the idea of telling my friends and family that I met my future husband on Bumble or Tinder just makes me feel so awful. 

I've realised I don't enjoy getting to know people on dating apps. I just wish it happened 'organically'. I wish someone got to know me offline and showed interest in me in real life. I wish it wasn't so contrived, so 'obvious'. And ultimately the deeply feminine side to me wished I didn't have to go to such efforts to 'look for' or 'seek' attention and interest from men - I wish it came to me, like it seems to come so effortlessly so many other women I know. I realise this is quite fucked up but, basically, I wish it was a guy in real life taking the lead.

It doesn't help that two of my friends, completely independently of each other, recently told me that their male friends had asked them out after getting to know them and they are now in relationships. It just seems to fuel my mindset that everyone - or rather the people around me - is living a different life to me and I'm very abnormal and fundamentally undesirable. And I know I shouldn't rely on male validation to feel desirable - but when something seems to be happening to everyone else, I think it's natural to question what's wrong with you?

I know a lot of what I've said is fucked up, entitled and frankly whiny. But in all honesty, I don't know how to shake it and I often cry about it. I'm speaking to a guy I know from Bumble currently but I've decided if it doesn't work out, I'm taking myself off the apps entirely and seeking out this 'organic' connection I so badly crave. That's how much it means to me.

So there's a French exchange student in my university and I'm a master's international student. She's told me about her life, her family and that she loves a French dish called ""Galettes"" ( the savory kind - from what I know it's called Galettes de Sarrasin).

So she's been missing her family a lot because of something that's going on ( personal ) and she had told me that. So I was thinking of making her her favorite dish this Saturday...Infact, calling her over to make it together at my flat. 

I was thinking of asking her friend if she might be interested in me... and tell her about what I've planned . ( this is because she's a little shy, but oh boy when she talks... I just love it... love seeing/listening her talk)

Ok so that’s fine by me and I remain cool. Well we meet and grab food and take a walk around town at one of her favorite places and it goes well. We agree we each had fun and planned on doing it again but I thought something was up when she said I was a “super cool kid”. 

Well after that she remained really busy and the texts haven’t been as frequent as I’d like, once or twice a day but not very often like I had gotten acquainted to in my last “relationship” (if you could call it that). I’d say we text at least 3 days of the week. Anyways we chat often and I was getting annoyed that she wasn’t interested anymore in being friends so I asked directly and she replied that she was and sorry she made it feel that way.  

Now I know I may have messed things up by asking to be friends but honestly I don’t mind at all. She’s awesome and we share a fair bit and common and even though the conversation not as frequent as I’d like i still want to at least be her friend. 

Hopefully we can go out a second time and maybe I actually call it a date this time instead of a hangout but the question remains. Should I see where this goes or just cut all expectations of a romantic relationship? 

Again I’m completely fine with being her friend so it’s not the end of the world if so. Ladies I’d be curious of your thoughts specifically.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q23mxw/weve_been_texting_for_months_but_have_only_met/
65,q23sgf,1633462547,I am speechless. How do I even respond to this? And this was after spending &gt;$250 after 2 dates.,"[https://imgur.com/zvXMmNQ](https://imgur.com/zvXMmNQ)

If you can't see the image, the text reads:

""Background-Leek2693,  I had a great time with you yesterday. I enjoyed our time together, but  I want to make something clear if I may. I expect my partner to be  fully responsible of our spendings when we spend time together. I want  us to be in the same page. You seemed a little hesitated yesterday, so I  just want to make it clear. **I deserve a gentleman who is happy to provide for me. I believe that is the basis of a relationship.** If that is not what you looking for, I respect that.""

Is  this absolutely insane or what? I am dumbstruck and feel absolutely gut punched. First of all, in no way did I hesitate to spend the $150 last  night, or the $100 on our first date, for food, gas, and event tickets.  She did not thank me at all when I took out my credit card and paid for  everything.

Also, what's even more  crazy is that we had a conversation about men and women being equal in a  relationship last night as well. We're in the same career profession,  and her salary is close to mine.

I have no clue how to respond. I really did enjoy my time with her and this text just feels absolutely insulting.

A  part of me thinks this is a shit test and she's joking and seeing if  I'm a walking wallet. But a bigger part of me knows this is absolutely  real and this is exactly what she demands. We only had 2 dates but we've  been talking for longer.

The problem I tend to find after much thought though is the time frame between dating someone and knowing if I actually like them that much to be in a committed relationship with them.

Years ago I used to jump the gun pretty quick, after maybe 2-3 dates on average before asking a woman I'm currently seeing if they actually want to be in a committed relationship. Pretty much all the time this turned out bad due to many various reasons such as lack of mutual interests, different lifestyle/schedules but most of all insecurities I didn't know until later on in the relationship. A couple of the nicest women I dated turned out to be the most narcissistic individuals I have ever met yet.

Due to this the past few years I have been cautious and taking my time in getting to know my date when seeing someone. However, by the time I'm sure I want to pop the question it's either they see me as a friend, just want to be a FWB relationship or they are actually seeing someone else already.

I guess my question is what time frame do you usually give yourself before knowing for sure you want to be in a relationship with someone you are dating?

\------------------------------------------------

**Tl;dr: Used to be quick getting in relationships with women that turned out to be bad relationships.

I never really dated in college except one time but that didn't end well so I didn't really date for the rest of undergrad. As a result, I only really had physical relationships and it got me really used to that. After a while though, it didn't make me all that happy so I tried dating this past year. 

It got a little harder after that since it felt like everyone I wanted to date didn't want to commit either and the girls who wanted to date me I just didn't have an interest in.

I'm absolutely terrified because I really don't know what I'm gonna do with myself if she's not in my life",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q25wvm/first_girlfriend_in_3_years_terrified_everyday_of/
99,q2620q,1633469307,Went on a date,I recently went on a date took this girl I met on hinge to an Italian restaurant then after we went to a bakery. The date lasted about 2 1/2 hours. We had great conversations and after the date ended she told me she had a great time and hugged me then said she would text me about doing it again. It wasn’t any longer than 25 minutes after the date that she texted me first saying again how she had so much fun and definitely wanted to hang out again. How long should I wait to reach out to set up the second date. The first happened yesterday FYI. And is she really interested in me?,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q2620q/went_on_a_date/
