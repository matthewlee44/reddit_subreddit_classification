This is my biggest fear with dating.

I’m 19 years old and in college and get no dates or really any attention from girls. My girl friends always tell me that they think I’d be a good boyfriend and try to set me up with their friends but they don’t like me.

After looking through some other dating advice forums for men, and I learned that women look for fun attractive guys and when they get older settle with guys they aren’t actually attracted to.

I really am afraid of this happening to me and considering my girl friends think id be a good partner, I’m thinking I might be the provider type guy girls will settle for.

I’m really afraid of this happening, how do I change myself to be the fun attractive guy for women? I really don’t want to be the sucker some woman settles for, I want to be genuine wanted emotionally and to be sexually desired by a girl once before I die.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1126024,public,self,How do I make myself into the type of guy women want and not the guy they settle for?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qt6euz/how_do_i_make_myself_into_the_type_of_guy_women/,no_ads,0.0,,,,

First date (weekend 1) went well. 2nd date I took her somewhere nice for dinner, this was weekend 3 (she said she had too much homework weekend 2 and suggested the next weekend, although she initially said yes). On this 2nd date, (again weekend 3) she asked about previous relationships of mine, I told her I had been in a couple relationships and she said she hadn’t been in one before. She made it clear she wasn’t into just hookups. She brought this up out of nowhere so I kinda thought she was into me. The 3rd date was one week after this (weekend 4). I wanted to try and make some sort of move but it didn’t feel right, I wasn’t getting the right signs from her. Also she has to wear a mask to go into her apartment building (it’s on campus theres a mask requirement), and she would put it on before she got out of the car which I feel like meant something. Either way I didn’t sweat it too much, I figured we’ll see what happens next time, this was only the 3rd date. 

In between these dates we hung out on campus a few times, each initiated on text once or twice per week, exchanged playlists, and she sent me a personalized update video of something she was doing with her friends unprompted (this was a couple days after the 3rd date). Basically the amount that we were talking and texting made it seem like we were on the path to some sort of relationship. 

The day she sent me that video, we got dinner on campus (it was early in the week) and when I dropped her off I told her we should hang out this coming weekend (weekend 5) because I wouldn’t be around the weekend after that (weekend 6). She said sure but then later in the week said she had too much work to do for her thesis to hang that weekend. This sucked because it effectively created a 3 week gap in between our dates, and she knew I wouldn’t be around the next weekend. During this gap I kept things going over text and she was sending some texts that made it seem like she was still into me, so I thought maybe we’d still be ok.

But then weekend 7 comes around (halloweend btw) and she implies she’s not around either night (even though we talked the week before about seeing a movie Friday night). She suggested lunch on Saturday instead, and made all the arrangements for that and also paid. When I picked her up she said she stayed in the night before, and I know she didn’t do anything Saturday night because when I mentioned a party we were having at my house, she invited herself. I didn’t invite her originally because it seemed like she wasn’t around. Anyway I told her to come and she said she was gonna, even saying “see you tonight!” as she left my car, but then she cancelled an hour later saying she had too much on her plate this weekend. She told me to send her pics of my costume.

I sent her the costume pics a few days later, and then later that day I gave her one more shot because earlier she made it clear she wanted to see a movie that was opening that coming weekend with me. I texted her asking if she still wanted to. She replied saying her parents would be in town that weekend and it would be a bit hectic so she didn’t want to commit and then back out, which kinda just felt like a cop out. She said to let her know what I thought of the movie. 

I haven’t texted her since then (10 days since last text, longest we’ve gone) because I figured I should just give her space because it wasn’t the first time she kinda flaked. This is when I started to accept it was over. I’m starting to get over the whole thing because it’s been 10 days but at the same time I do really like her a lot and I feel like we had a special connection and I thought she liked me. I guess I just want to make sure it’s not gonna work out before I completely write it off. I did run into her about 5 days ago, we chatted real quick about our weekends (she didn’t mention her parents visiting). I still went to the movie with someone else and she asked about that.

I will say that when we got lunch she did apologize for the flakeiness, saying she is just bad with time management, and she is really busy trying to complete her thesis. We have pretty much the same academic load but I don’t have the thesis, and that does take a lot of time. Even after this apology though, she kinda flaked another two times (once on the party, once on the movie which she said she really wanted to see with me a week prior) and that’s why I kinda just backed off and haven’t talked to her since. 

I’ll see her in class in like 5 days and then a couple more times this semester. I feel like I didn’t fuck this up yet, as it’s not like we got in a fight or anting. We just haven’t talked much since the last text, but is there anyway we can recover?

I am a 23 year old male finding himself in a difficult situation. You see, I've dated a 29 year old woman  who was my coworker and first girlfriend for 8 months and I broke up with her around 5-6 months ago. 

She was one sweet soul but held back by the trauma experienced in the past. That trauma affected her so badly that her mind created an alter-ego, a different personality to protect her from additional harm. They knew about each others' existence but she couldn't reach the others' memories.

She was reserved and shy and could barely socialize for extended periods of time. Ironically or unironically though, she had a knack for pyschology and she could read into my problems like seeing through a clean lense. She helped me a lot with my issues, helped me face myself on multiple occasions and she did so with patience, care and support and without judgement.

In the beginning she was unsure of a relationship and requested to just stay friends (in order to avoid losing me, turned out she felt she couldn't provide what I need in a relationship, and she was in a sense right).

I was deeply hurt by her a few times, but I feel I hurt her more yet she never wavered unlike me (We tried to restart 4 times, out of 3 on my initiative and due to my immaturity). I could tell she loved me with all her heart (so much that she could vision a future with me, which I found a bit threatening at such a young age and with such little experience).

I eventually broke up with her because I realized as I was developing in a quick pace while she barely changed. She due to her age was looking at me in a different way (her biological needs were surfacing, settling down), couldn't get out of her bubble, open up to me and share me her deepest fears, feelings. She insisted her family doesn't know about me until a time passes, I admit I was impatient with it in a sense, however a lot has happened between us. This also restricted our opportunities of meeting up and doing stuff together. 80 percent of the time we met outside work was making love. She was amazing at it but I eventually got tired of doing only that as a couple. 

She couldn't open to me about her issues (with herself or me) and if I communicated to her something I felt was a problem she collapsed. As if she was trying to keep our relationship a fairy tale where there is nothing wrong and everyone's happy and loving and joyful. She was also afraid to say no to me, was constantly worried that I would leave her and such.

Now she's been on my mind ever since with decreasing intensity, however I don't think I miss her anymore in that sense. I just have this sensation in my gut and brain as well (which I tried to forget since I identified as longing, however it may be different) that I want to have a closure with her and wish her the best. I feel like unless I do this I will never be able to truly get over her.

Is there anybody who have been in a similar situation? What did you do? How did it happen? I'm curious to know your answers.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1126039,public,self,Closure?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qt7l5c/closure/,no_ads,0.0,,,,

Things were going extremely well UNTIL he got an unexpected phone call. His phone sold him out, contact picture and all- a girl, initials with a heart next to them. He said “oh shit” then promptly got up and walked away to answer it. Obviously this immediately raised my suspicions so I looked through his friends list, since we connected on FB in the first place. The only one girl who had those initials lived in a different city two hours away. 

Later in the evening when we were playing cards, he asked to place bets: if he won, he could kiss me; if I won, I could ask him a question - obviously I knew what he was trying to do but went along with it. I ended up winning, and point blank asked if was *truly* single, or not. He made up some elaborate story,  said the girl in question was actually his cousin who recently moved to another city across the country. I couldn’t help but snicker because I’d already found her on FB and knew the story was a sham. 
It wasn’t his cousin, it was a girl his parents set him up with that recently moved from their home country to the city that was a few hours away. At that moment I knew exactly what was going on, but he thought he could play me like a fool.

I knew this guy was from a culture that has specific cultural practices in regard to dating and unfortunately for him; I have a few very close friends who happen to be from the same area.
He said his parents want to set him up with a good match and get married ASAP but he’s waiting another year or two.

He lives in another state and was in town for work. We are both successful, educated professionals. While he was in town, we had the most intense love affair. Literally spent almost every minute together. The best chemistry I’ve ever had with anyone. When he left, we kept in touch and decided I should visit him. We picked a weekend and when I texted him to confirm the exact dates, he ghosted. 

I decided I had to move on. And about a month ago, I met someone locally and we have been steadily dating. We aren’t serious yet. But it could go that route. And I can tell he wants it to. It doesn’t feel as intense as my summer love. But it feels solid and healthy. I am definitely into him :)

Two nights ago, summer love texts me out of the blue. Three months after he ghosted. I did not respond. Last night he called me while I was asleep. Left a voicemail and sent me some more texts. This morning, I decided to text him back and see why he was popping back up. He said he has really intense feelings for me, but he ghosted because he doesn’t think long distance can work. Or that he doesn’t know how to make it work. But he still really likes me and wants to see me again. He offered a vacation for us. I told him that I could never be okay with us just popping into each other’s lives because I would want more than that. We both agreed the situation is tough. And that is where we left it. 

Now my brain is all swirly and I don’t know how to feel. So tell me - what would you do? Pursue the best chemistry of your life, even if it might not end how you want?

It's clearly still very new and I still feel like we're getting to know each other, but I've seen enough to know that this is someone I want to invest my time and energy into. I do really like him and care about him, but he's far more into it than I am. He's made some comments to me hinting at the fact that he wants to tell me he loves me, and has even admitted that he's going to be the first one to say it. He's very sweet and caring, but sometimes I worry that he's more into the idea of me than the reality.

Everything seems very rushed, and I need time to allow my feelings to grow naturally. Right now, I feel like I'm trying to rush my feelings to meet where he's at. He is aware of the fact that he can be a lot at times, and I've told him to be patient with me because I'm not where he's at yet, but it's starting to give me anxiety when I'm with him. When we're out with a group, he only wants to talk to me and is heavy on the PDA which isn't like me - I like to be social and never want to be *that* couple. Even when it's just the two of us, all he wants to talk about is how into me he is. These things are all very cute and sweet, but in moderation. I want to have a conversation with substance too so I can get to know him more.

I do really like him and care about him - he's literally the sweetest guy I've ever dated hence why I jumped into things with him so quickly. However, I think I need to talk to him about how I'm feeling a little smothered but I don't know how to bring it up in a way that won't hurt his feelings. I don't want him to feel stupid or feel like he needs to hide some part of himself, but I think I do need a bit of space to let my feelings grow. Any advice on how to bring this up?

TLDR; The guy I've been dating for a little over a month is way more into me than I am him, and his constant affection and adoration is a little much for me.

They flake on you hard after initially saying they knew what they wanted, and then suddenly second guessing what they want at all. They build you up with expectation through invested conversations, early dates, and long late night phone calls where it feels like you're connecting so well, but then abruptly leave you on read.

That's why I've started to realize that it's important to set emotional boundaries with matches, especially being a guy. If they want that emotional connection, they need to prove to me why they deserve it by showing up, and yeah, I think at this point, I would say that I'm more likely to let my emotional boundaries down for the woman who is willing to get intimate sooner than the woman who leads me on and burns me out by being a complete waste of emotional energy.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1126054,public,self,"Hate to say it, but I think everyone ""looking for an emotional connection"" out there really just burnt me out on my emotions altogether",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qt934y/hate_to_say_it_but_i_think_everyone_looking_for/,no_ads,0.0,,,,

So I’m in college and kind of in a dilemma. There’s this chick in my class, we’re friends at this point in the semester. We sit next to each other, talk shit on the other students in our class together, encourage each other during our group presentations, have worked together in groups, have studied together, walk her back to her car and talk to each other a lot in class. 

Outside of class, she’s not a good texter and has been straight up with me about it, saying “even my best friends know I’m a shitty texter”. She sometimes doesn’t respond to hw stuff and I’ve called her out on it. I’ve hit her up to see what she’s up to before, and usually get like a sorry didn’t see this the next day. I sent her a “hey” Text earlier this week, to test the waters, she responded with “hello what’s up”, I said “what’re you up to” and got no response. 

I normally would cut off all ties with a girl like this, but I kinda have some feels for her.

I wouldn't say my love life has ever really been that exciting, but I've had my share of romance in the past. This past summer, I met two girls who it seemed I really connected with, but ended up just feeling weird, confused, and kinda hurt by the end.

Obviously a lot of us have been feeling anxious to get back into the world since 2020, and once I was fully vaccinated, I decided ""I'm gonna go out to a bar, try to dust off the cobwebs on my personality and have a good time and meet some new people."" Now, a lot of times in the past, I'll say this to myself, but then I'll end up basically just hanging out with myself the entire night. I think a big part of my problem is that I can have good conversations with people once the ice is broken and we've found some sort of common ground, but actually breaking that ice in the first place and striking up a conversation with a complete stranger without feeling forced or awkward, is something I struggle with.

Anyway, on this particular night I saw a girl with a cool, clearly hand-made hat (which it turned out she actually made herself) and just felt compelled to say ""Hey nice hat!"", not really expecting it to even lead to a conversation. Well I guess she must have found me pretty attractive, because she ended up inviting me to hang out with her and her group of friends for the rest of the night, and as time went on and we talked for a while, she started getting really friendly and hands-y with me, and then eventually just asked me if I wanted to go outside somewhere and make out for a bit. We did, and she was honestly pretty aggressive lol (in a good way). Unfortunately we didn't end up going home together, but she asked for my number and sent me a text so I'd have hers, and told me she was free the next day and would love to see me then.

So the next day I text her: ""Hey, I'm pretty much free all day if you still wanna get together""... no reply. I wait a day to text her again, not wanting to seem pushy or anything, and I just ask ""Are you free sometime this week? I'd love to see you again."" Nothing. A week later I even decide ""fuck it"" and I try calling; maybe she just sucks at returning texts or hates texting, who knows. She doesn't pick up, so I left a voicemail; felt kinda cringe, yes, but I feel like I kept it short and to-the-point, basically just saying ""Hey it's BattlinBud, we met at that bar last week, I'd love to see you again sometime if you're free"". Still nothing. So at this point I just give up, because I mean, even if she's not deliberately ignoring me and just generally sucks at returning texts/calls or whatever, it's clear that if she really wanted to see me again that badly, she'd have made an effort to reach out. Just bums me out.

So, funny enough, a month or so later I'm hanging out in another bar in the same area, and at one point I notice that she's there too. She doesn't notice me at first, so I think to myself ""Okay, here's my chance to figure out if she was deliberately ignoring me or not. I'll just sit here, and if SHE sees ME and goes out of her way to say hi or something, then I'll know she probably wasn't ignoring me outright."" Sure enough, that happens, and yeah, she does seem genuinely happy to see me again. I tell her I texted her before, and she looks through her phone and finds the texts, and it did come off like yeah, she honestly just missed them somehow or didn't realize who it was. Her and her friends end up leaving to go somewhere else, but again, she says ""Hit me up tomorrow"". And... yep, you can guess where this ended up heading. Haven't heard from her since, it's been months.

So, I mean, at the end of the day, it's not like this whole situation was some giant heartbreak or anything. It's not like we ever had any major attachment to each other. But it's overall just a shitty little roller coaster that I didn't need to go on.

Cut to some time later, at yet ANOTHER bar. I met a different girl, and this time, things ended up going significantly further, which makes the ending even more bitter. This girl was actually the one who struck up a conversation with me and not vice-versa, which I feel rarely happens to me. At first I wasn't really sure if her interest in me was romantic, or if she just thought I seemed like an interesting person and wanted to be friends, because she was there with her roommate and I didn't realize at first that they just lived together and he wasn't her boyfriend. But anyway, we ended up hanging out until the bars closed, then she invited me to her place, and at that point things should've been pretty clear to me, but I'm a fucking piece of spaghetti and so I still ended up just awkwardly hanging out and talking to her for like an hour before finally mustering the courage to say something like ""...so you wanna fool around?""

So this actually led to a nice little summer fling, for a little bit. We never put any sort of label on it or anything, but we just had a lot of fun, and it certainly seemed like we enjoyed each other's company beyond just the aspect of physical attraction (I mean, I can say I did at least). And then one day... she just never texted me back again.

With the other girl, it was like ""Alright, we really only met once, I mean, it's kinda shitty that she seemed REALLY into me and then I never heard from her again, but whatever, maybe she's just a flaky person, I should move on with my life."" But in this situation I'm just completely at a loss for why this happened. We'd been seeing each other on an almost weekly basis, and were actually in the process of texting back and forth planning to see each other again, when suddenly she just drops off the face of the earth. Like, mid-conversation, she just stops texting and then I never hear from her again. I seriously can't emphasize enough how I never got ANY kind of negative vibe from her prior to this, up to and including the final message I ever got from her. We seemed to always have a great time with each other: we were both in that rose-colored ""new person"" phase obviously, so I honestly don't think there had been a single moment of tension or uneasiness between us thus far. She always seemed enthusiastic about seeing me again when we'd say goodbye, and honestly I kinda got a vibe from her that she was maybe a little afraid of me ghosting her: she would always say things like ""I don't know if you'd want to do this again sometime but if you would, I would love to as well.""

She is a school teacher, and this did happen pretty much around the time the school year started up again, so I guess that probably explains it: her schedule is just fucked now and she barely has time for anything. But, like... if that's the case, I wish she'd at least have said something, instead of just disappearing mid-conversation and never responding again. I ended up sending her a couple more texts, a few weeks apart each, asking if she wanted to hang out again sometime, but at this point I've just given up. It's been two months since I've gotten any communication from her, and even longer since I've seen her in person. And yeah sure, there was never any label or feeling of commitment between us. I don't think either of us were really looking for a serious relationship, at least not at the moment. But I still wasn't expecting it to just end so abruptly, and without any closure whatsoever. I mean, it's not like it was just a casual, purely-physical one-night stand. It felt like we were at least becoming pretty good friends, and would continue this for a while, at least as long as things remained un-complicated.

So I'm just feeling adrift and unsure of myself right now. I mean, on one hand, it was nice to have these connections, however fleeting, in the first place, and especially after a year of being cooped up inside, it did feel somewhat life-affirming to go back out into the world and actually find a couple romantic connections. But on the other hand, it just stings in a way that I don't think has really happened to me before. I mean, in the past, if I've been romantically involved with someone, there's generally been a pretty clear reason why it ended. A lot of times, if it's not a serious relationship (and I haven't had a ton), you just kinda gradually drift apart over time. Neither of you really ""ghosts"" the other, you just eventually fall out of each others' orbit and then one day you realize you haven't heard from each other in a year.

And on the other hand, there's certainly been plenty of times I've met someone, we talk for a bit, exchange numbers, but then never hear back from them when I text. I don't tend to sweat it when that happens, I get it. A conversation is just a conversation, there shouldn't be any expectation that it'll lead to anything more. But this has rarely, if ever, happened to me before: someone gets REALLY physical with me and seems THIS enthusiastic about seeing me again, or in the latter case, starts flat-out hooking up with me on a regular basis, then just ghosts me, leaving me with really no idea why it happened. I just don't know how I'm supposed to feel about this, or about myself.

I dunno. Maybe right now I'm just betraying how laughably little experience I really do have, when it comes to dating or sex. I don't mean to come off all angsty and whiny. I know my sad boy problems probably aren't that sympathetic to many people. And I definitely hope I'm not coming off as, like, angry towards all the world's women because of this, or something. The way I see it, people are people: some people suck, some people are cool, a lot of people fall somewhere in between, and it's a lottery that doesn't discriminate by gender.

I'm honestly not even really sure what I'm looking for by posting on here. Advice? Just to be acknowledged maybe? I dunno, I guess, like I said in the title, I just want to vent for a bit, in what I hope will be a safe space to do so.

I'm thinking about trying to get back into the world of dating apps. I really haven't had much luck with them in the past, but it's been a while and I feel like I've been through a few changes since then. And I'm just kinda getting tired of going out to bars or whatever, and hoping ""Maybe I can have enough of a personality tonight to figure out how to meet some new people."" It feels like it usually ends up being a waste of money, because there's very few places you can go and just hang out and meet people, without being encouraged to buy something (even if it's just food), or having to pay to be wherever you are in the first place. At least on a dating app, you can meet a person and get to know them a little without having to even leave the house, so if you DO end up going out somewhere to meet them in person, even if things don't pan out, it still feels like less of a waste of time and money than just going out on your own and ""seeing where the wind takes you"". But at the same time, I kinda dread going back to dating apps, because like I said, I kinda suck at them. Again, I feel like I never really know how to open the conversation, and as a guy I feel like I'm the one who's usually expected to do so.

We went on a date and held hands and made out a few times.

We kept texting afterwards and he told me that he was obsessed with me, falling for me, that he could see himself spending his life with me, and that he might be my perfect match, things that no one's ever said to me before.  I made him lose all those feelings by being clingy and needy after he said that it seemed like I wasn't sure if I wanted to be with him because I said I was concerned that we might not be sexually compatible because he was very sexual while we were talking and I'm a virgin. I acted crazy and sent him a bunch of messages asking him to reconsider. I just didn't want to lose him. And then he said he might be able to get those feelings back if I had sex with him. I told him that I didn't want to have sex with someone until I was in a relationship or at least until I knew for more than a few weeks and he said I was stubborn for thinking that and we stopped talking.

I went back and forth between thinking that he just wanted to have sex with me and being upset that I lost him since then.

I’ve been talking to a guy I met on hinge since June. We used to text back and forth all day, with a few hours in between messages, and see each other once a week. Now he regularly takes up to 12, if not more, hours to respond to texts, and the last time we hung out was mid October. I tried to initiate a hang out a couple weeks ago, got blown off, and he never tried to reschedule. It seems pretty clear he’s fading out, and I want to say something to him because I do like him and I’d like to salvage it if I can, or cut it off clean if he’s not interested. What should I do/say? Below is the longer text from my original post if anyone is interested 

——

30F here. I’ve been talking with a guy who I met on hinge since June. I purposefully was taking it slow and keeping it fairly casual as my most recent ex was very emotionally abusive and left me scarred. So I never brought up the “what are we” convo and when he never did, I didn’t push it. 


We had a pretty regular routine going where we’d talk every day and see each other once a week, because he works weekends and I work weekdays. But lately, things have been off. He still texts every day, but it’s a lot less. He’s always been a slow texter, but sometimes I won’t hear from him for over 12 hours. And we don’t see each other anymore. I remember the exact date the last time we saw each other was because it was the day before I started my new job. October 17th.  Lately I know he’s been busy with work, but I asked if he wanted to hang out one more time after that (maybe two weeks later) and he kind of blew me off, saying he was really busy but he’d let me know. He never let me know, so we didn’t see each other. And he hasn’t offered time to reschedule since. 

I paused my hinge account a couple months into us spending time together, but I’m getting frustrated and feeling like he’s slow fading me. I like him a lot and I’m sad, but I would rather just know if he’s interested and cut it off flat rather than be slow faded and ghosted. I want to say something today, basically stating how I feel like he’s been distant and want to know now what’s going on, but I’m not sure how to word it. My ex left me with a lot of insecurity and I know I overthink things and assume the worst a lot.

I was a big girl when we first got together but now am super fit and have a complete new look. He makes it obvious I am not important to him but I adore him... I don't want to keep feeling alone and like he doesn't care but I am at the end of my ropes. We have just started couples counseling but I don't know if it's too late.... I can feel myself just saying don't care anymore. I know I can be grumpy in the mornings but when I express my feelings he says it ruins his day.

He opened my message and didn’t respond I assumed something came up and the next evening he messaged me explaining his dog had a pretty bad accident and he got caught up. The dog is okay just will take some time for it to recover. I showed my support and comforted him. Things were okay and then he started acting strange. He wasn’t saying much so I asked if he needed some space as I assumed he must be stressed. He said yes and we haven’t spoken since. 
I want to respect his desire so I’m giving him time and waiting until I hear from him. However we have mutual friends and I mentioned how sad it was what had happened and that he needed some space and I felt terrible how upset he must be. She said he has been talking to his group of friends and hadn’t seemed distant at all. I’m now worried if I said something wrong and upset him? Is it normal to take space from the person you’re seeing? Or is this nothing to worry about? I want to respect his privacy and his decision but I’m a bit confused why he wants space from me specifically. I just wanted to be there for him.

Maybe many of you can relate. When I was a teenager and throughout my twenties I've had success and failures in dating. Part of me just failed to understand what I really wanted. 4 years ago I had a relationship go so miserably I checked out. I needed more time to work on myself as a man. What did I want out of life? through some much needed soul searching my life changed drastically. In essence I took myself off the dating scene to focus on me. I hit the gym, Became a personal trainer, and Investor. Now in my early 30's I can see nothing but abundance. I think the problem with us as men is that often times we are so busy following expectations that are not our own. It is important to think for yourself and apply the knowledge that you gain to your own life. It's crazy because now when I go places women will indicate interest, give me THAT LOOK, strike up a convo etc. While the new found attention is nice it isn't what I hang my hat on. As quickly as it is gained it can be lost. You have to remain focused and if you decide to date do so but very cautiously. As of right now for me dating is still off the table. One female asked me why I wasn't dating my answer? I'm enjoying time to myself.

1) In mountain biking, they say the best way to get hurt is to brake. Riding fast helps.

2) everything that you are used to, once done long enough, starts to seem natural, even though it might not be.

Eventually, the new habit becomes automatic. Bingo.

Every time you give in, you actually make the wrong path easier to follow. But every time you go the right way, you get stronger.

Doing the uncomfortable is key. It widens your circle of comfort.

You think you’re working hard. You think all you need is your lucky break. Wrong. You haven’t done what’s necessary at all. You haven’t made the sacrifices. You haven’t put in the time. You haven’t faced the flinch. You haven’t learned the lessons and you don’t have the scars. Not for the fights that matter.

They want the glory, not the suffering. They don’t want scars because they like being soft. They don’t want to be humiliated; they want respect—they just don’t want to earn it. They want the keys handed to them. But it doesn’t work that way. If you choose the ring, you’re already better than most. Why? Because you chose to fight. You’re a contender, and almost no one can say that about themselves. The ring is different for everyone, but wherever yours is, it’s where real risk happens and where the spoils are huge.

It’s where the fight is won, yes—but it’s also where you can lose everything. Inside, you’ll face pain again and again with no promise of reward, but it doesn’t matter, because in the ring, you’ll know you can make a difference.

Today, right now, eliminate all excuses from your vocabulary. Refuse to mince words or actions. Refuse a scar-free life.

She comes in and starts cleaning the rest of it, and I feel the need to jump back in and finish cleaning since she wanted it done now.

I felt bothered that she would come in and start cleaning rather then just let me finish it. Or if she did want it done by a certain time that she would communicate that. She is feeling bothered that I would find issue with her coming in and cleaning, so maybe I am reading in to it too much and need to take a chill pill. Does it make any sense for me to be upset that she asked me to do something and then went and did it instead? Or am I the asshole for not doing it right away when asked?

What I find though, is that I walk away from the experiencing feeling that I need to rush to do things on her time frame (and if unspoken then immediately) when asked, rather then on my time frame, accommodating my schedule. Maybe I should have initiated the conversation with a ""I know you like the kitchen cleaned right away, but I have this thing, then I'll do it after, is that alright?"" That's probably the better take away.

Just to be clear, this isn't a situation where I never do things around the house and just say I'm going to, or that she bears responsibility for the mental load of all household things.

I’m really confused. 

I’m 18(F) and I started uni in September. I made a lot of friends on my course, including a guy who I hang out with a lot.

We met a couple times in the first week before classes started and once we started classes we would study with some other friends on occasion. I think we hit it off almost immediately. 

We have a similar sense of humour, doing the same course obviously, some similar hobbies and interests, but he’s also pretty different from me as well which I like.

We started studying together more often, usually just the two of us. We see each other usually once a day during the week and he often comes over in the evening or we go to the library in the evening to study. We sometimes hang out at the weekend as well if he’s not working.

Some days he’s stayed over really late, the latest being until about 4 in the morning. We’ll study, play games together, chat a lot. I really like him, and I think we have a lot of chemistry.

He’s even admitted on a couple occasions in conversation with me that we have a connection of sorts. Like he said the other week talking about two other people we know “yeah I think we have a lot more of a connection than them” (speaking about a girl we know who was interested in some guy) but I couldn’t really tell if he meant it in a friend way or not.

Here’s the thing though. I don’t know if he likes me as a friend or as something more than that. 

On Thursday we went out together and hung out for most of the day. He left just after midnight and I texted him a little and mid conversation he just left me on read. I thought he might have went to bed because it was late so I just went to sleep. In the morning he still left me on read, I went about my day and he messaged me again after he finished work. I asked how his day was and such, we had a small conversation and then again he left me on read. I felt a little sad that he didn’t ask how my day was and I know that sounds dumb and overdramatic but I just ignored it and went to bed.

This afternoon he replied to one of my stories on Snapchat and we had a conversation after that. I asked if he was mad at me or if I did something and he said no, and we’ve been talking on and off whilst he’s been working today

I feel really stupid to be honest, but I just can’t tell whether he likes me or not. We hang out all the time and have talked at least once every day for the last month, but then other times he can be a little cold with me and I don’t know if I’ve done something wrong or not. It doesn’t help that I’m a pretty anxious person and just tend to overthink all the time. 

I don’t know. I think he’s just interested in me as a friend and that’s fine. I’m fat and not particularly attractive so i’m sure i’m just not his type.

So we went out and after some hours ended up in his place. Had pretty good sex (in my opinion).

In the morning I was kinda awkward, he offered to go grab a meal but I wanted to run away quick. He called me a taxi, was pretty much a gentleman and after all messaged me same day. But his messaging was pretty dry. Like he seems interested but sometimes he’s way too weird, like “captain obvious” type of thing. We made sure we wanted to meet again but didn’t do so yet because of I got a flu after some days and needed days to cure. He wasn’t anything too caring but asked questions like “how do you feel today” , “did you go to the doctor” , “oh yeah you must feel bad” , but nothing sweet or extra personal, in a very dry manner. (From my perspective)
 I even stopped replying to him at one point and he called me asking still how I was. Phone call was pretty good. After it he asked me out again but one more time, no good morning, no wishing a good day, just very dry and weird not even asking if I recovered or not. I said I was still sick and we didn’t go out. If I don’t message him, he does still send me a message like “how did your day go?” And if I give him detailed answer he’d be like “good” . 

I honestly just already wanted to ghost him before he gave me a phone call. Because i have no idea why he would ask question without trying to keep a convo alive. He usually replies to my messages very fast also. So I’m super confused if he’s doing it for the second fuck or if he’s genuinely interested and it’s his way of communication? Whatcha think ?

We hit it off from the very first date, and related to a lot of things. They seemed super intelligent and attractive. After about a week and a half we were officially dating. I thought that things might have been going a bit too fast for my liking, but we were just that into each other and I didn't think too much about it. Then last Tuesday, they dropped the bombshell on me that they're non-binary. 

I like to think of myself as a pretty progressive guy, and honestly I don't have a problem with the way someone chooses to identify themselves even if I might not understand it. The problem arose when they couldn't stand the fact that I saw them as a woman, despite having made NO indication beforehand that they were NB, and being completely fine with me calling them my girlfriend and referring to them as female up until that point. It almost felt deceiving in a way. I feel that if it meant that much to them, they would have told me in the beginning and not led me on. I like to think it all could have been avoided if they'd discussed it with me in the beginning, but unfortunately that wasn't for me to decide. 

After that conversation, they made no effort to cooperate with me and try to talk things out. I reached out once, and they were very short with me before leaving me on read. All of the time we spent together, all of the memories we made even in such a short time, apparently mean nothing to them because of something that they failed to communicate to me until we were well on. 

Attack me if you feel the need to, Reddit. I get it that people in the LGBTQ+ community have it hard, and part of me is sympathetic in the sense that it must have been hard for them to talk about. It's possible I didn't handle it the way I should have, either. Still, they didn't even want to TRY to remedy things. It was a ""I can't be with someone who sees me in this way"", and that was it. I'm hurt and I think I'm completely validated in feeling that way. My heart is still with them, but I don't think that's reciprocated at this point, and honestly I don't want to be with somebody who just shuts down on me when things go wrong. 

I don't know what I'm wanting anybody to tell me. I just seriously don't understand how people can be like this. They pretended to be female, then left me because they didn't want me to view them as female. I've been trying to make sense of it for days now and I've gotten absolutely nowhere, while they continue to send me these stupid snaps acting like nothing has happened.

Funny thing was the other person usually knew because I would tell all my friends in hopes of getting advice. (I know, bad idea on my part.)

I have never known what to do in this situation. I say this because it was very awkward if I try to talk to a girl but she knew that I liked her.

For example: during high school, I had a crush on someone in my class, so I formed a weird convoluted plan in my head over spring break to pursue her and told all my friends about it. She most likely knew that I liked her, probably because I told my friends about it and they told their other friends and eventually spred around to her.. So when I got back from spring break I tried to follow these plans hard and strong. But talking to her was just too damn awkward. My friends eventually told me to stop, and my ""plans"" were cut short. Although I blame this mainly on the ""plans"" in question involving draining my mental energy over her, completely expecting a relationship in return, refusing to consider other options, and basically all the things you should not do in the dating world.
