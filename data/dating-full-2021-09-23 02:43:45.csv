Guy 1: Thought we hit it off because he would message me back and forth for two weeks and reply quickly. We talked and joked about a lot of things and decided to ask me out. I said yes and we were set to take a stroll along the riverside and then a hike. Right after, he asked me about my astrology sign, I never heard from him again. He works in tech so it was really odd that that was something that bothered him (I'm a libra and he's a cancer, if you all wanted to know). I really thought he would be a good guy and we really clicked. 

Guy 2: He was kind of alright. I felt I was interviewing him the whole time and carrying the conversation. I was about to tell him it wouldn't workout, but then he asked me out. I gave him the benefit of the doubt thinking, he's probably not good at messaging and would be better in person. I messaged him the night before we would meet to confirm where we were meeting and said I was looking forward to it and petting some dogs too. He never replied and never heard from him again.

Guy 3: He's a bit older in his early 30s. We spoke a bit and decided a video chat, but that lasted 15 mins because he had an early day for work the next day, but said he really enjoyed talking to me and would like to meet in person. Since I wasn't able to get a feel of what his personality is like within 15 mins, I agreed to meet and get to know him more. Just like Guy 2, he pulled another disappearance right before we were going to meet.

&amp;#x200B;

Why do guys set up a place and time to meet, but disappear hours before? It's so disrespectful to my free time. If something came up last minute, they can communicate that and I would be fine rescheduling or if they are not interested and change their mind about meeting, let me know so I can hang out with my friends instead of booking them in my calendar. Are there no decent respectful men who know how to communicate or is it my luck? I'm so burnt out and skeptical when guys talk to me and try to set up a meeting now.

Last week I wrote a post telling the story about how my first kiss happened, and I promised to bring news about how the second date would go. So here it goes!! 

We went to see Shang Shi, and it was lovely. She was holding my arms during the entire movie. I never experienced that care in my life. It feels awesome. It's actually a big surprise to me how great it feels. Hope to never get used to that. 

We didn't do anything there, but after, when I drove her home, we stopped in a parking lot next to her apartment... 

Dude......  No words could ever describe how great it feels. We made out for almost 2 hours. I could say my kissing skills are pretty much improved!! 


Things that a lot of people experience during high school years I'm living only now. But I don't give a fuck about other people. It's being really amazing. No regrets. 

Date number 3 is coming on Friday, and I hope to advance to the next bases in the upcoming encounters.... I've been respectfull with her, and she told me that she's loving it.

And I have a group of about 10 friends that I've been with since kindergarten and first grade. We've grown up in the same neighborhood together and have generally just been there for each other when we needed it. And I'm one of three other girls in our group. Growing up, I never really thought any of my guy friends had a crush on me and we never really expressed our feelings much. It was when I was in middle school that I had my first boyfriend, which wasn't any of them and was just another classmate. Didn't last long though.

At the end of last year, I was approached by who is essentially the ""quiet one"" of our group. Doesn't talk much but is kind of funny and polite and all that. We share a lot of the same interests too like video games, comics, etc. And when he ""asked me out"", I legit thought he just wanted to hang out like we normally do lol. But no, he actually wanted to take me on a date and things went from there.

Now, the person I'm referencing in my title is essentially the ""class clown"" of us. Always making jokes and generally a hilarious person. But ever since I started seeing my now boyfriend, I noticed he's just not the same as he used to be. He doesn't make jokes like he used to, especially when me and my boyfriend are in the same room as him. Though whenever he's with other people, he's normal.

I mean 10/10 amazing girls (e.g., smart, popular, cool, beautiful girls). Girls just wanted to be my girlfriend... until junior year of high school. Junior year of high school I went through puberty, and overnight, my relationship with girls changed drastically. I was a goon: girls felt comfortable around me and I'd win them over with humor. However, after Junior year that changed... now I get cold-shouldered, ignored, and honestly, it just seems like I repel women.

I don't think I'm bad-looking. I'm pretty confident, good at sales, I rock climb, play instruments, speak Spanish; I'm pretty educated for my age, and I'm pretty successful, too - like I think I'm pretty cool... I've even asked friends to critique what I'm doing wrong in the social settings; they always come back pretty dumbfounded: they say there is nothing I could have done better. I'm good at sales and always had girlfriends lol - I promise I'm not socially inept. Really it just feels like the only thing that has changed is girls aren't down to give me a chance, at all.

I feel pretty bad, honestly - like I'm cursed. I don't think I've changed really. I'm the same dude I always have been. I watch all my friends &amp; roommates go on dates, have girlfriends, hookups pretty effortlessly, and I'm totally isolated. Is there any advice out there?

For pictures of me, I actually just made a /RateMe post because a friend and I were trying to get to the bottom of this...  please go to my profile - it should be my only post besides this.

I’m back again with another question. Before I get to that I just wanna say I (a male) recently had a first date with this girl I met who is currently in college and I’m not but will be starting it back up again next spring season. Our first date went pretty well I believe. We were both very awkward and we both did a lot to try and keep the conversation going. The only thing I’d say was bad was the ending. When I brought her back to her home I was really nervous and panicked on what I should do and just dropped her off without saying really anything. I felt really bad and messaged her a thank you for the date and an apology for being really awkward and dropping her off without so much as even a handshake. She told me it was alright and that she’d be down to hangout again when she comes back in a few weeks (I believe it’s every 2 weeks). We only have a single day to go on a date every few weeks because of our schedules. Even texting isn’t an option because she’s not very good at responding and I don’t try texting her because I don’t wanna bother her and waiting days or up to a week for a response isn’t really what I want which like I said in another post I made I’m ok with it now because she’s busy with school and I’m working and doing my stuff. 

Advice I want: 

I just wanna ask what I should do for a second date in terms of progressing the relationship between us. I was very awkward and stiff as a board the first date and I didn’t try to make any moves on her and didn’t touch her in any way not even an attempt at a kiss. I want to make it known to her that I want to hold her hand or just walk close together arms around waist or shoulders or even kiss her but I’m not sure if I should just ask her or make some subtle move that ends up with my arms around her shoulders. I’m not very good or experienced when it comes to taking girls on dates and making moves, flirting that type of stuff.

I do want to let him know, but not aggressively enough to where he won’t come to the lakehouse at all because he’s still a good friend of mine for many years, we just had sex a few times when both of us had no one else to see or go to (yay covid times).

I've never been incredibly successful in dating. That seems to be the titular consensus that many of us have but mine has been, especially rough. I have lost weight, changed jobs, and have acquired a small inner circle of friends so that I can facilitate some semblance of a social life.   


The problem is this: of my male social group, which is just really 2 other bro's, I am, it seems subjectively/objectively, the uglier of the bunch. These guys are great btw, and how I feel isn't any sort of indictment on them, by any means. 

  
That being said, I'm beginning to despise that aspect of our friendship. It's becoming more difficult to enjoy the comradery as the sort of attention they receive from women is not what I experience on any sort of level.   


For instance, on multiple occasions, when we've been to bars together, they both, have had women purchase drinks for them, flirtations happen quite a bit but that same can't be said of me. Also, the sheer amount of rejections is...alarming. I'm not some sort of social pariah. I've never had the feeling that I come across as creepy, just...a lack of interest. It's becoming embarrassing and when they are around at least, I do not approach women any longer because of the unsettling feeling.   


To a degree, I've come to bear a grudge against them for something that is not their fault at all.   


I feel absolutely foolish. I'm 37. This should be a non-issue, yet, my mind drifts towards it. How do I deal with these feelings of inadequacy and not bear ill will against my friends?

My strengths are: passionately curious, Straightforward, open-hearted, ambitious, well-mannered, empathic, caring, family-oriented, Shy, funny, friendly, respectful, self-esteemed, grateful.

Moreover, I'm a virtual assistant, able to business develop through, lead generation, build over lacs of phone contacts database, any data collection like email, mobile etc. from any website, 2d to 3d design, audio isolation and mixing &amp; so on.

My dreams: Exploration Geologist, Audio production with moral lyrics, make videography with traveling on an open places etc.

And also consider myself a decent-looking man. But appearance is not the key element about me, cause I can offer way more than that!

I believe every human being does mistakes, and so do I, so does everyone else. It's what makes us human and we have to learn from those mistakes.

I'm happy to get to know you and adjust to you, as do I welcome learning new things for you and from you, being an eager learner.

I have many dreams and wishes I would love to share with you, I see myself as very hardworking and dedicated to achieve what I want to.

I am invested into religion and have been for the past 10 years, but I don't traditionally follow it, but logically.

Now with being 27, I'm worried I'm running out of time, so I do hope to find a woman who fits to me and who thinks the same about me. I hope there might be someone on the corner of the world who could feel deeply for me. As I would for them.

Months later she admits she wasn't over her ex and only was talking to me like that because she was ""vulnerable"". Lol

This whole thing was a huge blow to my self esteem and I'm still suffering mentally from it honestly. I'm not super experienced with relationships (dating as a racially ambiguous dude fucking sucks) so I got pretty attached to her.

We got really close emotionally during this time and I helped her through a bunch of depressive episodes. We talked about a lot of shit and actually started a nonprofit org together earlier so she eventually started to reengage with me saying she wanted to 'keep me around' and that I 'had potential'. Whatever that means. She asked for us to be friends so we could work on stuff together for grad school.

I got ticked off and went off on her because of the way she gave me the cold shoulder, and basically told her I didn't feel like she cared about me. I said that I don't know how I'm supposed to be friends with someone who's willing to cast me aside like trash after the way I was there for them. Her response was to say I was being ""very manipulative with her.""

Apparently telling somebody how I feel and why I'm upset with them is being manipulative now? It feels like these gen z girls just call everybody who has an issue with them manipulative/gaslighting just to absolve themselves of blame. I honestly wish I could be friends with her but even just thinking about her and the way she treated me makes me way too upset.

It's a long story, I have some past posts about it but the jist is she put me in therapy. Its my first time in therapy, it was my first time considering self harm. I've been through all kinds of shit in my life but no one and nothing has ever hurt me like she did. Since then, Ive been engaging in abnormal and risky behavior, I can even recognize it myself, I haven't been emotionally stable. 

I moved states for school but just before I did, I asked out this girl 29F from my gym. I didn't think much would happen, I was moving in less than 2 weeks. I was wrong, we had a whirlwind romance and I fell for her HARD. She is the only girl Ive ever been with that treated me how ive always wanted to be treated. She picked up the broken pieces of my heart and helped hold them together. We discussed how things would go when i moved and I said i dont think we should do long distance, she agreed though sadly. 

We've stayed in touch and though we established we weren't dating weve been flirty. She has expressed plainly she wants more. Now im visiting back home and we are together again for about a week and a half. It's just like before, we're all over each other and I feel more loved and at peace than ive ever with anyone else. Again she's plainly expressed she wants more. 

We had a chat about our futures. I love her and could see us being together but there's 2 issues, one of which i feel like a selfish ass for. 
1 - I want kids, she does not. I've always known I wanted children. Adopting does appeal to me somewhat but even if I did adopt a child I want bio kids too. She doesn't want kids for a few reasons, primary reasons include fears of passing on genetic issues her family has. 
2 - I want to sexually experiement. I don't really consider myself poly but I like the idea of me and my partner sometimes bringing in another girl. I feel like an ass for this, i feel selfish as fuck but when i think about what id want in life this is a part of it. She has no interest in this whatsoever. 

We talked about it and we're pretty much where we were before except now we both know what each person is thinking. We consider ourselves to be datting while im here and when im gone... super flirty friends. She's glad I was fully honest with her though she is disappointed. We've only known each other about 4 months and this has been a faster romance than ive ever experienced, I know thats related to my emotional instability and she recognizes it too. As for her Im actually her first boyfriend. 

So we have an emotionally fucked up 26 year old boy trying to figure out life and a 29 year old virgin girl in her first relationship. Yah she's a virgin, and Im fucking terrified of hurting her because I realize how easy I could being her first if we get there and things don't work out. I realize how much trust she's put into me, how vunerable she's let herself be too me both emotionally and physically. We've done some things sexually but she won't have penetrative sex because of no long term commitment and fearing how it'd hurt her heart. I respect that, at this point I'd sooner be shot in the arm than have her feel like I used her.

I feel like after the 6 dates we had we know some stuff about each other, but our conversations are often lacking a flow. She barely asks me stuff and seems barely interested in me when we talk. The only time I feel like we have great chemistry, is when we make out, although we didn't have sex yet. The intensity how we make out, however is getting more intense everytime. This is actually one of the few times I see some type of passion in her eyes. The conversation problems we have are making me kinda insecure, paired with her talking about cool other guys are and stuff like that. So some days I felt very confident, and the dates and conversations were better, but sometimes her lack of affection makes me insecure, so we have a hard time talking to each other. 

The problem is: I don't know if I am like this, because I kinda like her already and want to make it work (expecting my insecurities to vanish after we're more close to each other), I am probably expecting to get really in love with her if we keep this going. Or the second possibility could be, and I'm feeling this for a long time, that she's just leading me on for attention and doesn't really care about me. I never was in a situation like this, so I don't know if I am just being an insecure fuck, or my gut feeling is actually correct on this. 

For some context: even when our dates aren't that great, she always asks me when we are meeting the next time. Also on the better date we had last time, she asked if I am meeting other girls, and we decided to be date each other exclusively. I kinda told her about the vibe I am getting from our dates, that I like her as a person and asked her about her opinion, she just said she can't say much about it and 'wants to go with the flow'.

My social skills are basic at most, so I mostly hang out with my old friends. Everyone, including my family, knows that.

Because of this I never had a girlfriend until high school. She dumped me for another guy farily quickly. I wasn't really surprised, but certainly upset. People mocked me for being a 'loser' until the end of school, as did my family, though not as bluntly. My older sister had sex with her third boyfriend at the age of 16, which made me look undesirable at least. I was totally pissed when I discovered my father's secretly setting me up with his friends' daughters 'so I don't end up alone' (I wasn't 18 yet). Yes, he did it out of pity/shame. Without my knowledge. Twice.

I've tried dating since but with no luck. The first girl I've met through dating app stole my wallet and the other one, from college, was a crackhead. There were no more attempts, since I had to do this in secret and it's not easy. Because of my family's cringe behaviour I'm embarrassed to show interest in women even in front of my friends. It became like a taboo in my head, I feel bad and guilty for wanting a relationship.

I also didn't want to waste anyone's time so I just quit dating for all those years, but it's unbearable for me in the long run.

Hi guys, I am looking for some hope. As sad as it sounds, I was physically abused by my Dad a couple times a week for 8 years. The verbal torture was also another thing I dealt with. I have been functional for the most part of my life, moving onto becoming educated and a good person- not resorting to drugs or alcohol as coping mechanisms. However, I’ve noticed in the area of intimate relationships I struggle the most. I have seen a therapist for a couple of years now (I’m a 33 year old female btw). That has been really helpful. Now onto the fun part, I’m in a new relationship where my boyfriend is kind, loving, secure and respectful. Due to my past, I am having a hard time getting physically close to him because of my deep rooted fears. My therapist says I have a fearful avoidant attachment style and I’m terrified of men getting close to me because they will hurt me. My boyfriend would never hurt me and I consciously know that but it doesn’t stop the anxiety when he’s close. I’ve tried so many coping mechanisms and I still can’t shake it.

So let's get to the point.

I am currently 20 years old, and I am a Racecar driver. Not professionaly, just as a big side-hobby.
My family has a racing background and everyone has an interest for it, therefore I always travel to races with them. Mother, Father and sister.

During this season I have been fighting (competing racing-wise not actual fighting) closesly with another racer, she is really good and we almost broke even at the end of the season.

I got to know her a little bit at the end, but as of now we are just sending casual texts/snapchats or liking /commenting on social media. Neutral but good friends.

She also brings her family when there is a race, we are very similar in that fashion. Only difference is that I dont know if she has a GF or BF, and she is 25.
She is maybe the first girl I've met that actually shares the same interests and seems nice or kind, and looks cute.

I believe she dosen't have a GF/BF but I am afraid to ask. Because if I ask that, she'll imedietly know what I am looking for... or .. well yeah you get what I am saying.

I am also afraid of the akwardness if i where to ask her to go out sometime or the ""have you got a BF/GF"" question. I know her father now so the akwardness would also affect the relationship with him..

I partially feel like cutting things off and just saying this isn’t going to work for me.
