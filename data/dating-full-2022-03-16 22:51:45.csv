I'm 28F and honestly I've never felt good about my looks. Never in my life have I received attention from men (not even catcalls!) and have never had a relationship. In fact I've had a few male friends who have basically friendzoned me as a result of my looks. Whereas I see them go after more attractive women all the time and then treat me as their confidant. Then the few times I've gone on dates or had small ""situationships,"" I've never once been called beautiful or gorgeous or anything like that.

I guess I don't really know what to do short of plastic surgery. My biggest issues are my really weak chin (which makes it seem like I have a double chin) and big nose, thin lips, and really assymetrical eyes due to braces/jaw clenching issues. Body wise, I've also hated being thin and average height (not cute and short or tall and model-like). But overall it's my face that gives me the most grief. Plus I don't have a desirable hair color/skin color (really pale and average looking). I even posted on one of those amiugly subs on here and got confirmed that I'm like 4-5/10 max. No one had anything good to say.

I just feel so bad about my looks and a key point of confidence has been forever shattered. It's so bad that I avoid photos.

I've had thousands of clicks, and probably 100 or more messages a day. 

But like dating, quantity doesn't mean quality. Most of them want what I'm selling for half the price I'm offering. 

Other people clearly don't read the ad at all and ask me ten questions that are all answered in the ad. 

I've had some creepy guys hitting on me. 

I have maybe ten actually interested people a day. I usually set up five or so times to meet and let them see what I'm selling. 

I have been stood up all but three times. 

Sound familiar?

These are not dating problems, they are internet problems. Whether selling something online, or dating, you're just throwing information out into the public. There is no control of who sees it and no bar for who can contact you. So many people are just wasting their own time by not reading the ad or offering way less than I was asking. Just like so many guys are wasting their time by spamming every woman they match with, or pushing for casual sex when the person says they're looking for something serious. 

And people stand people up and ghost. It's not about me, it's a rejection of who I am, it's not someone playing a trick on me, it's just a reality that X amount of people are kind of scumbags, and you're going to encounter all of them online. 

I handle it the same way I do dating: 

1. Don't spend time or energy that people aren't a good match. Don't tell them they're being awful or confront them. I just say ""no thanks!"" and move on.

2. Ignore trolls, creepy or inappropriate people. They are everywhere. I ignore catcallers on the street, I ignore creeps online. 

3. Keep expectations low. I don't set up a time to meet with people that's inconvenient for me or a big commitment. I only agree to meet with people where I already am, or very nearby. I had someone ask me to drive an hour to show him what I'm selling, and I said no. When dating, I make low key dates for a drink or dinner, at affordable and nearby places. That minimizes the frustration when I am inevitably stood up. Then I grab a drink, talk to the bartender, and head home. 

A good date is just a pleasant surprise, not the expectation. 

I WOULD like to sell my stuff at some point, but I'm not really straining myself to do it. Dating isn't a game where the more effort and need for success you put in, the more you will get out.

I can't see this working out but there are exceptions. Maybe there can be friendship but that's about it. As far as dating, sex and children, no way.

If you have a very masculine couple, the man will have more leverage in the relationship as he will have more options in case the relationship hits a rough spot. Chances are, he'll take the opportunity since it's there.

Likewise if you have a very feminine couple, the woman will have more leverage in the relationship as she will have more options in case the relationship hits the rough spot. Changes are, she'll take the opportunity since it's there.

If anything, the very feminine couple could end up even worse because of paternity fraud and the man losing a bunch of money. Feminine men are more productive and are more stable but also are less attractive, less fertile and have smaller penises. This is a recipe for disaster.

I'm mostly writing this post just to clear my head. 

I was in a relationship for 4 years before we broke up (on good terms) and we haven't talked to eachother for 3 years (my demand). I recently saw their profile on a dating app and reached to that person to ask how they're doing. We exchanged a bit and we agreed on meeting eachother eventually.

We talked again today and agreed on getting lunch this week. 

Here's what is up my mind : I've grown up and matured a lot since i last talked to that person, but i don't think i am 100% insensitive to that person. And with reason in a way, that's an old friend with who I lived a lot of experiences, but it makes me nervous to meet that person. It's a bit like finally removing an bandage to check if the wound healed, but if it did not it might just hurt again.

Honnestly I think I'm fine. It's just that the idea of seeing that person again stresses me, even though I know it'll be great seeing them again.

This is a platonic meetup btw.

We have been seeing each other every week or two weeks or so (we both travel so sometimes more time passes). 

We started out expressly as just casual dating; me telling her that I wasn't really looking for a relationship. 

One day out of the blue she tells me she feels like she has feelings for me and doesn't feel that its mutual and that I should clearly tell her or this would stop. The day after we met up and, though I actually really like her, I told her that I'm not really sure how I feel or how I will feel about having a serious relationship in the future. 

She told she was not expecting that answer and that maybe (as I told her that time) it was  better for us to part ways. 

After a few days she calls me up and tells me that she actually does not want a full relationship, just for us to see each other more often and that we become expressly exclusive. 

I'm going to meet up with her and tell her that (i) my feelings haven't really changed (they may have even changed a bit for the worst since I sort of think she was doing some sort of unconscious manipulation) and (ii) that I would actually want to keep seeing and getting to know her but that I'm not ready to be exclusive with her.

We had been texting through messenger before he approached me and have me his phone number. We texted for about a month and then we went on our first date 

The date went really well and he hugged me after walking me back to my car. He told me that he had a wonderful time and really wants to do this again sometime. I shot him a quick message after I got home thanking him for paying and letting me know I was interested in another date. We didn't text much after that, we exchanged a few texts but not as many as before. It has almost been a month and no new moves for a second date. We did start chatting in at the pool where he works a little more and he always greets me with a good morning and some small talk. 

Then, this past Friday I left him a note on his car letting him know I'm ready for the next date. I wrote that if he kept the card, it means no 2nd date. If he gives it back, i choose the time and place. And if he calls/texts me, he gets to choose the time and place. 

I don't see him until Tuesday (today) bc of his other commitments. However, he didn't mention the note at all today or hand me anything. Now he has two jobs (firefighter/EMT &amp;lifeguard) and he goes to college. He was also in the military and expressed his loss for someone he seemed to know, with all this Ukraine invasion stuff, i can't imagine it's easy. I don't want to seem inconsiderate or anything. Today, my friend and my brother did go with me so maybe that was a little intimidating? He was all blushy and red near me and kept smiling like a goon. 

I am not sure what to think? Do i keep waiting? Do i bring up the note tomorrow when I see him?

I don't expect him to rush. Based on how we fell apart before despite him saying he has no grudges and things happen I'm sure he is still skeptical to date again. He hasn't had a lot of relationships and the ones he did have lasted a couples years at a time. He is very mature and has his life together, we have similar hobbies, he always tells me how good company I am.

Pre-face: I was heading to the Maldives end of April and had the trip booked for sometime, I was going there alone (this is important).

I met this girl on a dating app back end of 2021 and we instantly hit it off. So much chemistry where we talked a lot, saw each other a lot and on our first date, we racked up a pretty high bill and I gladly covered it. Her response? She booked a hotel for the following weekend and told me to come spend the weekend with her where she got us wine, dinner and watched a movie following up with sex. In the hotel room, we sort of asked each other what we were looking for and I said I wanted something more serious but she just got out of a year long commitment so wasn't ready to settle down just yet, but all good. It was going really well for the next month or so, seeing each other a lot, talking daily on multiple apps and having a fun time.

I joked about her coming to the Maldives with me since it would cost me nothing extra to have a 2nd person come (hotel was already covered). She said she'd absolutely love to and literally within a few days, she bought her flight to the Maldives and the plans were in motion. At this point, I was off the dating apps and so was she, so I sort of assumed we were indirectly exclusive, especially with the trip coming up but we never confirmed, it was an assumption on my end.

After her booking, she organized a nice dinner for us 2 the following weekend where she made a very personal handmade card, explaining that she liked me a lot and is really looking forward to the trip. I was super happy about it and was happy it was moving in a positive direction.

She's been super transparent and always has been, but this next part bothers me. Her old classmate texted her to meetup who had the same name as someone she matched on the dating app before me and agreed to go hang out with him. She thought she was meeting up with her classmate but it was this guy she matched with a while back. She told me the story and we both laughed it off and she felt so embarrassed. She told me not to worry and that was that. 2 weeks after that, she calls me up saying that she's seen the guy a few times and is starting to catch feelings for him, she asks me if its okay that she continues to see him........at this point I was stuck, we weren't exclusive so I had no say but my defense mechanism kicked in saying 'tbh you can do whatever you want, we aren't exclusive but I'd prefer not to hear about your dates with him'. She agreed and it continued (I'm still kicking myself for this)

I thought I was okay with it but it bugged me, I bottled it inside. I didn't want to bring it up because I was scared of becoming vulnerable, displaying my emotions only to get hurt. I organize a weekend get away shortly after for a soccer tournament where she came with me and it was just an overly really nice weekend. I was starting to finally open up and letting her see my deeper emotional side. She still proclaimed to like me a lot but it was in the back of my mind and I just didn't like that she was fucking someone else while still seeing me, but we weren't exclusive so I couldn't say much.

The following weekend, she organized a lunch and then movie tickets to watch Batman. Over lunch, she had her hand on my lap and holding my hand and I just stop and go 'so.....with the trip coming up, I want to become exclusive with you. I feel weird you seeing someone else with this trip coming up, what do you think?' Honest to god, I thought she was going to say yes, but she hesitated, became really flushed and said 'honestly, I can't agree to that right now.' I was taken aback and the rest of the lunch was quiet and awkward. We went to go see the movie and after, right before we parted ways I said 'listen, I'll let you think about it. but I don't want to be anyone's second option'. She didn't know what to say since she was running late but she gave me a really big hug and we agreed to talk the following evening on the phone.

Come tomorrow evening, she let it all out. She said she had wished I said something when she asked if it was okay for her to date around, she would've told him to take a hike right then and there. She also said she continued to see him because she was getting her affectionate and emotional needs from him which was missing from me, but she didn't know how to bring it up with me since she didn't want to come across as needy. I said that I don't want her coming on the trip if she's just going to keep thinking about this other dude the entire time and she promised that wouldn't happen, that she'd be focused on me but she asked, 'well, what happens after the trip? After we get back? You're only here in the city until July and you want to go away for your MBA end of this year to a different city'......She was right, that's what was going to happen and she said she also needed to think about the long term and couldn't agree to going exclusive when what happens after was so up in the air. She proclaimed that I needed to open up more and was getting her emotional needs met from this other guy but had strong feelings for both of us. I was still her first option but because I was upset at all this, I lashed out. Before we hung up in frustration, I told her to 'give me a day to think about all this but look up flight cancellation options' and I hung up...........

This was where I ruined it for myself, since the following night, we spoke on the phone and we both felt like shit. She said she couldn't continue on like this and that she couldn't give me what she wanted, something more serious and that was that. I really wanted to try and mend things but she said it wasn't fair to both the guys. Although she really liked me, and her actions absolutely proved her words, it just wasn't meant to be. We started talking end of December and broke things off last week, so nearly 3 months-ish.

What I learned and what you can as well:

\- Men, allow yourselves to let romantic interests see what you're vulnerable about. Be open with your feelings, don't be afraid to be emotional since women need to see that from you. It'll strengthen the bond much more than you think.

\- It's okay to open up your heart, communicate your boundaries and let others know how you're feeling, someone worth being in your life will want to work with you to understand your feelings

\- It's okay to become dependent on other people for emotional needs, let them know you're having a bad day and need a chat (even though you probably know how to deal with it already) or let them know you're having a good day and have exciting news to share.

I hope you've read this far and have also learned something, but it's been tough. I really liked this girl and thought there was something but the last few weeks, I've been journaling a lot and even discovered my attachment style, which is Dismissive/Avoidant, which explains basically everything and why I acted the way I acted. I get scared to become vulnerable and depend on others for my emotional needs. I hope some of you resonate with all this. I realized I wish I knew about all this much before dating and I would've worked on it a lot more but I can't do much now.

I kept going to the campus, paralyzed by anxiety and guilt. I know I can do it but something was holding me back.

Today I told myself I cannot leave the campus until I get one number. I was their first 45 minutes walking around in circles and making excuses. Eventually, I saw a cute girl with curly hair eating ice cream. She was my type. I went up to her and first talked about the ice cream. Then I complimented her hair and shoes. I was about to ask for her number but my dad called and told me to leave the campus. 

Whether I got her number doesn't matter. I got out of this fear and I felt euphoric.

Some opinions and insight would be very appreciated!

I‚Äôve (26F) been trying to casually date for the past year. In the beginning, every guy I‚Äôve been on dates with has told me they don‚Äôt want anything serious and they aren‚Äôt interested in a relationship atm. But about 6 dates or about a month into casual dating, they want to have a ‚Äútalk‚Äù then bring up commitment and transitioning into boyfriend/girlfriend relationship. This has happened to me 3 times now, I thought guys were commitment avoidant specifically when they stated it clearly. I told them clearly that I wanted the same thing when they mentioned they only wanted casual dating. Is it me? I definitely want to settle down at some point and I‚Äôm also not jumping into bed with any of these guys,l. This has happened like a month after meeting them and I just didn‚Äôt know them well enough to have sex with them at that point. I don‚Äôt have any rules or expectations for them. They can do whatever they want, they have no obligation to me. If they have a fwb or date other people, absolutely not my business. I know I have a slight fear of commitment, I like to go slow and get to know someone well before I decide to move forward. Is it just me? My girlfriends tell me how they can‚Äôt get a guy to commit to them and they only want to be fwb. I don‚Äôt really talk to them about what I am or am not doing in my bedroom so my theory is that causes them some discomfort that makes them want to commit. This has been a running joke in my life, all three of my ex‚Äôs proposed. One of them proposed twice, I said no every time. I have a reputation to be a monogamous, which is definitely true. I truly don‚Äôt have my life together right now, maybe in a couple years I‚Äôd be open to a relationship but I just can‚Äôt add another person into my future as I would a serious boyfriend/partner. So maybe it‚Äôs my fear of being enveloped that brings out their insecurities? Or is it just that I‚Äôm choosing to date the wrong guys? Maybe it‚Äôs covid, making everyone super lonely?

Every date we had got longer and longer because I believe we enjoyed each other's company. The first date was about 4hrs and by the 4th date it was about 12hrs long. I would always plan the dates out with suggestions from her depending on what she wanted to do.  First date ended with just a hug because she is extremely shy and conservative, so I didn't want to make her feel uncomfortable by kissing her or anything at the end. 

Second date, I wanted to try to test the waters out and held her hand at the end of the date, which she did but it seemed like she was uncomfortable, so I decided not to do that on the 3rd or 4th date. 

Third date, she actually introduced me to one of her best friends and her bestfriend really liked me and even asked my date where can she find another person like me because her bestfriend only gets fuck boys through OLD. Third date ended well at the end of the date she asked why I don't text her often. I normally only text her once or twice in a week mostly to confirm/plan our dates out. I was surprised by her asking me this and took the initiative after to text her about almost everyday the following days leading to the 4th date. I noticed that I was the only one doing the texting so I was confused whether or not she was into me because she was the one that asked me to reach out to her more. I started to think about the 3 dates we had and that I was the one who always showed more interest in dating her, but I can't say for sure if she was also interested because of her quiet and shy personality. She smiles and laughs at my jokes and things I say, but she also smiles when I ask questions about herself. At this point I kind of think that smiling might be her natural reaction to everything, including when she is feeling nervous. 

4th date, I decided to ask her about if we were on the same page at the end of our 12hr date, which we were having a lot of fun together. At this point I have not made any form of physical touch other than casual bumps and casual arm behind back to guide her through crowds. So when the date was finally ending and I was about to drop her off at her home. I asked if we could talk for a bit before she left. So, I asked her if we were on the same page in dating and she felt a bit offended. I honestly thought it was a reasonable question to ask because I really liked her and wanted to find out what her goals were because I did not want to get lead on. Keep in mind that I am just asking what she was feeling about me and what her goals were. I reassured her that I am not asking her to DTR or am I asking her to be exclusive. I just want to her know what she was feeling about me. She said that she liked me and that we wouldn't spending so much time together if she didn't like me. She also said she wanted me to treat her like a bestfriend, which I replied with that I'm not on dating apps to find friends. Im here to find a partner who I am compatible with and that if you want to be friends I don't mind being friends with you, but I am not going to date you as a friend. She then said that we don't even know each other that well and that she doesn't trust me yet. I felt really hurt when she said that she didn't trust me. Although we don't know each other well, I felt that I made her feel safe and comfortable around me. Who would even go on multiple dates for such a long time if they didn't at least have some trust in the other person.  After going back and forth on me just asking her if she was interested in me/dating me she not giving me a clear answer. I think she got fed up and just said that I like you, which is the same answer she gave me before. The conversation ended there and we both got out of the car and hugged. She told me to text her when I got home.

When I got home I sent her a text saying that I enjoyed our date that night and asked if we were still cool. That was the last text that I sent her and she hasn't replied back at all for 4 days so far and I haven't sent her a text after the last one because I wanted to see if she would initiate texting me back for once. Do you guys think its over between me and her? Despite all the red flags I saw, I still really like her. Should I text her again? How long do I wait to text her or do I wait for her to text me first?

**TLDR**: Went on 4 dates with a girl I really liked. Asked if we were on the same page and she felt offended and wouldn't give me a clear message.

Out of the blue this girl that I knew through a mutual friend kind of deal hit me up and said ‚Äúdo a flip‚Äù which is like her kind of humor and I think it was a subtle kind of pickup deal but I‚Äôm not sure.

Our backstory is I kind of used to have relations with one of her best friends and we tried setting up a buddy of mine with her, and she ended up not being into him. After the setup I moved out of town for work temporarily, and the girl I was having relations with ended up finding a guy and they got engaged so she‚Äôs out of the picture entirely.

The new girl I didn‚Äôt talk to much after I went out of town mostly because she was a friend of a friend and I didn‚Äôt want to violate girl code or whatever lmao. But a little bit after my former FWB got engaged, I matched with the new girl on tinder and we kind of talked for a few days and I thought it was one of those deals where she just swiped right on anyone she knows and I‚Äôm the kind of guy that swipes right on everything so it‚Äôs no wonder we matched. She ended up giving me her Snapchat and that was 6 months ago. Eventually she left me on read and since I didn‚Äôt really have a romantic interest in her at the time I didn‚Äôt pursue it

Fast forward 6 months and she sent me that message from the beginning of this post, we snapped for a few days catching up and talking about how things are going and eventually she says that we should hangout when I come home from where I‚Äôm at, and I said hell yeah, I‚Äôm down. Then a few hours later she left me on read. A couple days later she sends a selfie of her at work and the conversation resumed for a couple days and she left me on read. I played back a little bit and hit her up first after that and we chatted again and and then I left her on read.

This cycle continued for a few days to where she‚Äôs finally left me on read and I‚Äôm like not sure if she‚Äôs playing me or if she‚Äôs interested so I haven‚Äôt hit her back up in a couple days

I can‚Äôt really make heads or tails of the whole thing to be honest. Like she made it a point to tell me unprompted that her and the girl I used to see aren‚Äôt friends anymore and seems like she wants to hang out and has similar interests, but she leaves me on read a lot rather than keeping things going, and there‚Äôs never any sort of like good morning/good night kind of deal. I could just ask her outright but it seems a touch premature and I don‚Äôt wanna come off crazy for suggesting something like that this early on

So I guess my question is, how should I play this? When I get home I was gonna ask her if she wanted to go on a motorcycle ride to a forest out our way because she seems like an outdoorsie/adventurous kind of girl. 

Thanks for the help in advance, I know this is kind of a long post but I‚Äôm hoping by being specific someone will be able to read between the lines and give me the skinny lol",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163840,public,self,Mixed signals,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tfzme4/mixed_signals/,no_ads,0.0,,,

I have a pretty solid job and would consider myself above average in the social department. I am never the life of the party but definitely can be engaging in conversation. Most of my dates have been through Hinge and it‚Äôs gone OK. Recently, I have noticed that Hinge especially in my city is becoming  very oversaturated with so many guys joining and I‚Äôve heard of girls getting 30+ likes a day, so it‚Äôs hard to even be seen in the first place. That avenue is slowly dying away and most of the girls I go on dates are seniors in college.

I have an ok social circle but most of my friends have moved out. I joined a non profit and also a professional organization and most of the women are 3+ years older or taken. While I am slowly becoming ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with those groups, they have their other circles as well and it‚Äôs easier said than done to just become good friends with people. I am thinking of starting a group through meet up around shows I like or other things I like to do. 

Based on recent statistics, it seems like people are not in relationships as much as they were 20 years ago percentage wise and I think the pandemic has accelerated that.

We both clicked immediately and fell into seeing each other regularly, sometimes every day of the week - and not without messaging at the very least every morning and evening. We both agreed that we‚Äôd take things as they came, and I was adamant that I would walk at whatever pace she was comfortable with. Naturally, this developed quite quickly and we were both happy with the way things were heading. We‚Äôve met friends, plans on meeting family, etc. 

Sarah has been seeing a therapist long before we met, as she‚Äôs struggled with some traumatic experiences from previous relationships and is actively trying to work through that trauma. I‚Äôve been extremely supportive and have always maintained that she take whatever time she needs to peacefully heal, and work through things for herself without the pressure to justify anything to me - as her sessions as one can imagine, are emotionally heavy and draining. Usually Sarah will reach out afterwards and we‚Äôll have a chat for a few hours, she‚Äôll vent and work through some residual feeling and we‚Äôll both go to bed.

Sarah has been slowly pulling away over the last couple of weeks, and it‚Äôs been confusing as we‚Äôre always quite good at communicating. She‚Äôs been particularly busy at work and had some upcoming projects and milestones that are both impressive yet incredibly draining and labour intensive, so it‚Äôs been understandable - although when things get particularly busy, she‚Äôs always allowed me to fill in the gaps to support her - pick her up from work to spend half an hour together, assist in small ways, leave her lunch and dinner, organise massages in her breaks to de-stress etc. Throughout the last couple of weeks this hasn‚Äôt happened, and she‚Äôs been subtle in avoiding calls and meeting as we usually do. 

She asked is we could meet yesterday to have a chat, and she immediately broke down. The gist of the conversation was that she had a confronting session with her therapist the day before, and the fortnight prior, and it was centred around our relationship and the fact that her therapist believes she‚Äôs not ready to date. She relayed that her therapist said it seemed as if she hadn‚Äôt worked through her previous trauma to a point where she wasn‚Äôt reliant on anyone else to feel happy, and it wasn‚Äôt fair on the both of us. She essentially took this to heart and has been spending the last two weeks trying to find excuses to ignore this advice because she was heavily invested in our relationship, although inadvertently cut me off and hurt me in the process. She‚Äôs chosen to work through this herself and wants to stop seeing each other, although is upset because she thinks she‚Äôs throwing away something amazing that she won‚Äôt be able to replicate. 

I told her that if this was anything else, that we could‚Äôve worked through it with some communication, but in this case I wasn‚Äôt going to try and convince her otherwise. I told her that I cared for her deeply and that whatever she needed to do for herself was the right thing to do. We had a general chat about some other things, and then cut the conversation off because it was clear we both didn‚Äôt want to leave, but everything that needed to be said had been said. 

She asked me to text her when I was home - and I told her she wouldn‚Äôt hear from me. I said that it‚Äôs not because I didn‚Äôt want to talk to her, and that my feelings for her haven‚Äôt changed - but in respect for what she‚Äôs told me she needs, I won‚Äôt be reaching out in any way. I told her she‚Äôs always welcome to reach out to me if she feels comfortable enough to do so for whatever reason, but I won‚Äôt be doing the same. She was upset, but apologised again and we left. 

This morning, she texted me something along the lines of ‚Äúgood morning, I know you have a particularly busy day so I hope it goes well. I want you to know you‚Äôre wonderful.‚Äù She‚Äôs since posted to all of her personal and business Instagram accounts, as well as posted stories - which she never does in the morning.

I went on a first date with a girl I met on Hinge yesterday, we grabbed drinks at a brewery near her home (unbeknownst to me when I asked her). Later I texted her that we should meet up again, and she said she would love to. I then threw out the idea that we should do something outdoors since it's starting to get nice out. She liked the idea but didn't contribute beyond that, which is... fine, I just hope it doesn't mean she's not actually interested.

At first I was going to suggest we go for a walk in some park, then I realized I don't know any fucking parks in the area and whether they'd have the right kind of feel for a date. So while searching up parks I got sidetracked and looked up what people even thought of park/walk dates. I got mixed results, with some saying it's horrible and not even a date, and others saying it's just boring. So now I'm on the fence about the whole outdoors thing that I brought up in the first place. Is that reasonable? Is there anything else to do outside? Seriously asking, I don't go there much.

And what are the expectations for physical contact, like kissing or anything beyond a friendly hug on the second date? How do you initiate that shit and know when it's the right time for it without seeming creepy? This is worrisome to me because I've only been on one second date before, where we hung out at my place and ordered food. That would not have been my first choice, but she was kind of hinting at coming over and I just went with it. Long story short, I think I ended up pissing her off because I was too nervous/didn't know how to make a move; literally nothing physical happened. And I only realized wayyyy too late that she was probably expecting that. The next day, she told me she just wanted to be friends.

To my shock and horror, playing hard-to-get is in fact still a real thing. There have been three separate instances in my life where women have rejected me, and so naturally i accepted their rejection (because I'm not a fucking psychopath who does the alternative) but then later said woman contacted friends to tell them how frustrated they were that i gave up instead of chasing them.

When a person plays hard-to-get, they are by definition saying that rejecting someone is a valid form of showing interest. It's not. You know it's not. How the fuck are people supposed to understand the difference between flirting rejection and real rejection? It's literally impossible. You don't get to use rejection as rejection AND as a way of showing interest. PICK ONE.

Then there's the inverse, when people agree to dates they never had any intention of showing up to. I can't even count the number of times I've been given this BS, but roughly 1/3rd of the time it's accompanied by a story about something dramatic happening exactly half an hour before the date was supposed to start. Dog attacks are a particularly popular story. Call me cynical but i find it statistically improbable at best that THAT many of my would-be dates were prevented by dog attacks specifically, and specifically within an hour of the planned starting time. Maybe i should be more open minded but i call cap on that.

Now i know the REAL reason for this particular mix-up these days, people trying to rack up high scores of simps in their inboxes, but it brings up the same problem as before. How the hell is anyone supposed to figure out whether they've been accepted or rejected when you use the same thing to mean both?

And then there's a third case, my highschool crush, who would occasionally text me VERY sexually explicit things (describing fetishes and sexual encounters, talking about her ""long distance, open relationship"" and asking me if i ""get where she's going with this"") but then act like she can't comprehend the situation if i so much as start to flirt back. And then a couple of weeks later the cycle would repeat itself. She would keep coming back and repeating some variation of the conversation as if she expected a different outcome but refused to describe the desired difference. I don't even know what to fuckin make of that.

For gods sake, ladies, how do you not see that by doing these things you're explicitly encouraging a dating paradigm of stalker psychos who don't take no for an answer. Is that what you want? I really don't think it is, based on everything i hear about how that's bad, as well as, ya know, common fuckin sense. I don't even care if i never get a date again at this point, I'll be happy just to see even a fraction of an increase in people communicating their intentions with any honesty.

So in short, if you have any self-interest left, then stop using rejection as acceptance and vice versa. Use rejection as rejection and use acceptance as acceptance. There is no discussion to be had over this. There is an objectively correct way to go about things, and an objectively incorrect way. You know which one is which. Do them correctly.

The issue is here, my gf and this girl still see each other almost every week and they‚Äôre always alone drunk in her room and I have expressed to my gf my discomfort with them being alone drunk in a room. 
I‚Äôve asked her to put boundaries, which included not being alone in a room while they‚Äôre drunk. My gf thinks it‚Äôs an extreme reaction and is not willing to do it because the girl‚Äôs feelings are in the past and they‚Äôre good friends.

We did homework together and got to know eachother a bit. There was no romantic pretext, though i'm sure we both were attracted to eachother then. I used to give people in my building extra fruit from my trips to the farmer's market to get them to go to the local shops and encourage community a bit. I'm very giving, and I tend to get a-lot of extra things I don't need so I like to give it away instead of throwing it away. 

&amp;#x200B;

When we hung out she exposed me to covid by accident, we both had to quarantine, and we ended up Facetiming and doing hw and getting to know eachother. By the time we were out we were alot more open with eachother, and we started to hang. We'd do homework and then chill and talk, she had told me she was an exchange student for the semester and her plan was to move to the other side of the country to start a nonprofit after college, and my plan was to stay on the coast we had met in. She was in an agreed open relationship back home and I am still healing from a traumatic relationship which left me considering myself wanting to explore multiple partners or possibly being aromantic. As we spent more time we became alot more emotionally open, divulged some of our insecurities about being at a 4 year, and just in general managed to find community in eachother as we struggled through the semester.

Maybe a month passes and there's certainly attraction and tension between us two, but despite my outgoingness I am romantically very meek and she is too, she prompted the first move and we slept together. It was awkward, as most first times are, but we talked about consent and safe words and boundaries sexually, and after this we were the close friends we were but also physically intimate frequently. There was no conversation about anything more, and since I knew where her head was at with the future I didn't really entertain the idea of a future past us remaining good friends over distance while we focused on our personal endeavors. 

As the semester progressed we leaned on eachother, found physical intimacy and emotional support, and we acknowledged that we got the dopamine our brains craved from the constant closeness and sleeping next to eachother. It was really fun, we'd sneak around and fuck but also go to museums and have no romantic affection other than behind closed doors between the two of us. When she went home we cried together before she left, and I really missed her. I was worried that since we'd fucked if I would be in a position where her partners would feel uncomfortable about us being friends, so I had to do some individual work to accept that and keep myself grounded through the separation anxiety. We kept in touch, but she's got less support than I do in her home life, so she had to work and do full time school and she wouldn't respond much, but she'd do her best. I was deeply depressed that i'd lost the support from her as I was so busy and burnt out and I didn't have anyone to turn to, and I still am recovering from the burnout. 

We took the excuse to have me come out there since we'd said that we'd try to visit eachother and travel, and that trip was a bit more romantic. I didn't mind since I didn't know anyone there, and it felt like in the new environment we were free to do whatever since we were alone in a way. We confessed that our struggles felt smaller with eachother's company, but we called eachother our bestfriends. We had physical intimacy, but also we are always touching eachother like we did last semester and we did sight seeing and museum crawls. 

She came out to my part of the country to see me and our friends, and she told me she was less invested in moving away because she felt she didn't have the support to manage and the friend she'd move with wasn't saving and she didn't think it was going to work out there. She was going to move to my state to be close to her support system and because she fell in love with the area. Her parents had no support to offer her, so she wanted to be somewhere where she had support and I was ecstatic to be able to support her. I hadn't contemplated a romantic future still, but we all talked about possibly living together to keep up with the housing crisis here and me and her said we should talk about if we could handle that later that night. 

When we talked about it she asked where I saw our relationship going and I got really emotionally overwhelmed because she had been contemplating me as a partner, but I hadn't even thought she was no longer with her partner out there. She told me he basically used her as a waiting space until his ex came around, and she has some personal development she's been doing and needed to talk to protect her feelings and solidify what my thoughts were. At the time I fumbled through the conversation and hurt her deeply saying that I had thought she'd find someone else and that we were noncommittally messing around, which was really obtuse of me considering how much we'd invested in eachother, at the same time I had seen all of these barriers to us as set in stone and I hadn't expected her to move near me at all, so I hadn't done the romanticization of us that she might have done. It was late at night and the conversation wasn't going anywhere, and my symptoms were dominating me so I shut down while she needed reassurance but I couldn't speak. We slept next to eachother, but we assumed that everything was dead in the water. We talked the next day and I told her that I hadn't thought about things like she had, and i've got some figuring out to do, but I did care for her deeply and wanted to be a part of her support group and we agreed that we want to work on ourselves as individuals, and keep things label-less but remain eachother's close friends. 

Now she's back in her town and i've been a mess trying to work on my problem of shutting down, my separation anxiety, and figure out what my outlook on relationships is after all these years of being single and working on myself, and i've realized that my brain is telling me that there's a possibility that i'm the fallback. Things didn't work out with the partner when she put her cards on the table, and I am conveniently already here. I'm going to bring this up with her, but i'd love some insight on what a stranger might think reading all this, and how to bring this up clearly. I suppose the reassurance that i'd need is that that isn't the case, but i'm not sure what that would sound like from her; or if that is the case just for that to be stated clearly since we're label-less and giving eachother the time to focus on our lives anyways and I can figure out how I feel about that being the case after hearing it.

If she did move here we wouldn't be living in the same place as we agreed that was too much too fast.

Have a first date coming up on friday.  I (24M) was asked to go to dinner by (25F), which, has never happened to me before, like ever.  Met via hinge like 2 months ago but didnt really talk much until the past couple weeks. Last weekend she expressed that she would love to hangout and we made plans more specific a few days ago.  Sounds great right?

Well it is, im excited. Im so nervous though, i feel like because i was asked out i have a lot to prove, like she has real expectations for me.  Also we've been texting a bunch with great, organic converation, talked on the phone for like an hour and a half once. Ive heard horror stories of a fantastic connection over text and it just shits the bed in person, and i really dont want that to happen.

I should mention that i do like her so far and it's not me just liking the attention, though i must say it is nice.

Idk I know i should just go have fun and meet someone new (easier said than done) but i just need some words of encouragement/advice if you could, kind redditors.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163835,public,self,First Date Nervousness,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tg525h/first_date_nervousness/,no_ads,0.0,,,

I told Jane how I felt that same year in 8th grade and later again in highschool, both times I was rejected by her and I tried to push those feelings to the side. I had short relationships with people I didn't really care for to try and forget about my feelings for this girl but it didn't do any good. Then Jane got a boyfriend our junior year of highschool and it killed me. 

I tried to move on, thats when I met my first real girlfriend, we'll call her Steph, and we started dating late our junior year too. We were together for almost 5 years until a couple months ago we broke it off and I began to try and figure out how everything could go so wrong. I cared about Steph deeply and I tried to give my all into this relationship because I hadn't felt this way about a person before and being able to start a relationship with them felt like this was meant to be. Although Steph and I didn't work out our relationship was special and it'll always be memorable. But, right after I only wanted to talk to one person... Jane.

Jane was always someone I felt comfortable talking to and no matter when it was or what it was about I always felt calm and happy just texting her. And I can't lie, everytime I'd text Jane a part of me would just hope that she'd broken up with her boyfriend. But she never said it, and I doubt she ever will. I feel like such and idiot thinking that I'll ever have a chance with Jane and god I wish I fought for her harder than I did. I wish I could tell her how beautiful she is and how funny and smart she is. But its too late for wishing. I'm stuck being the guy who wasn't enough.

TL:DR
I'm hung up on an old crush and she's in a committed relationship and I don't know how to move on even after being in a long term relationship.
