And usually to up your followers, you add people you don't know but have mutuals with? So I did that with this guy, we can call him Andrew. I friended Andrew and he accepted. I thought he was cute so I sent him a pm about some university things and left it at that, u know just to start a conversation. Then he showed up on my Instagram and obviously FB is not that popular anymore so I'm never active on it. So I requested to follow him on instagram and he accepted. I just had an innocent crush on him from his pictures and I knew we went to the same uni so I texted him again for a continuation of the university help I needed before. This way maybe a week and a half apart from the first time. I was thinking, he isn't in my program, I'll never have to see him again if I don't want to so let's ask him out. If he says no, whatever. So I asked him out for a cup of coffee during ur second conversation online and he said you seem nice but I'm not into you in the same way u seem to be into me. And I was like, that's totally fair, no problem and did not think about him again. 

Problem is, I knew he worked at this university cafe we have. I thought he just worked there as a waiter/cashier kind of thing and not as part of management. I had applied to work at that cafe as part of management before I knew he worked there. I just brushed it off and thought okay what are the chances he will be working as part of the management? That's a very slim chance. So I went to my interview for the position this morning and I was welcomed to the team. So the guy interviewing me gave me the names of the other people part of the management and guess what? Andrew was part of the management team yay \*i'm being sarcastic\*! I mean what are the chances??? I have to work closely with him and I'm feeling really embarrassed. I don't think he knows yet but he's going to find out eventually when I show up for the first day of work and I am dreading meeting him. I really don't want him to think I was stalking him :( it was just an innocent, very short term crush on someone I thought I would never actually have to meet = no consequences but now, this happens and I'm contemplating dropping out although that would be kind of an inconvenience to the cafe because they will have to find a new person etc and I don't want the other people to hate me by saying one minute I'm super excited to work there and then the other minute I want to drop out.

What should I do?? I could pretend like nothing happened but I am truly worried he's going to think I'm stalking him and I've had trauma before where this guy gaslighted me for being on the same train as him *one* time by pure coincidence. He did apologize later on for spreading rumours about me being a stalker but I am traumatised from that event and *cannot* go through it again. So please help! I thought stuff like this only happened in k-dramas but nooo, it *has* to happen to me lol 

TL;DR: Guy I asked out online who goes to my uni even though we don't know each other and only talked twice online is actually part of the management at a university cafe that i will be starting to work at. Meaning, I have to meet him and I'm scared he's going to think I'm stalking him hence i am contemplating dropping out but that will probably make the other cafe members hate me for acting super excited and then dropping out suddenly for no reason.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1153842,public,self,Real Life K-Drama...in a bad way?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s8osu5/real_life_kdramain_a_bad_way/,no_ads,0.0,,,

We almost never talked about 2 years except minimal normal class interactions. I was always slightly interested but after contacting her it grew into a huge crush now I can't focus on anything.

My logical brain don't believe in the ""league"" thing but she's very beautiful (probably objectively) and super cool and talks with so much confidence. I'm not nervous while talking to her and I don't think I'm low on self-confidence. But I'm not that attractive, I'm about average and a bit fat. So I don't think I have much of a chance with her.

But regardless I've took a step and properly met her (Though it's online due to covid). We've been talking for a week about every day or two days. Even though it's hard for me I try to not message her everyday. We get along really well and I love talking with her with voice call. At first I was not making much jokes then I quickly opened up. But for her, she started making jokes pretty early and laughs constantly both to her own jokes and to mine. And sometimes even things that are not jokes. Being a crush-driven state I am, I always laugh with her :D

**But I don't know if she acts this way with her friends**. She has some male friends which I don't mind at all. Maybe she's also like this with them also idk. During class and business meetings, she's laughs but not as this much

Other maybe signs:

* She writes detailed responses to my questions
* She laughs a lot in text too
* She returns to my texts pretty quickly but sometimes she's busy. But she never ghosted me so far
* She said she's very very happy when I've got the job (She's the one that gave me the job offer)
* She told me about her day without me asking
* She slightly teased me few times but nothing offensive
* We're working at the same company and we work together. During one-on-one meeting I've asked her ""if I have any questions about this thing can I contact you?"" She responded: ""You can ask any question at any time you want and I'll be glad to help"". Doesn't translate well into english but I felt passion behind the response :D
* We goof arround a bit
* She remembers the times we've talked and the topics
* Since I didn't meet her in person I can't say much about nonverbal things.

Also most of these can be just transference since I'm still in deeply crush state. So I can't give an objective view of things.

Of course it's only been a week. You might say it's too early and you're totally right. But this is our last semester at uni so I don't want to drag this too much.

I like to think I'm a nice to talk to. Some normal girl class mates I've talked to said that to me. I always want to leave a positive mark on the people I interact with, including her. I also love complimenting people and appreciating their work or help. Her feelings are very important for me but I can't blatantly ask her. Well, not that I lack confidence. I can but I don't want to ruin something by going too fast.

**So do you think is the feeling mutual? Or is there anything you want to say?** I just wanted to talk about this without the risk of being ridiculed by my friends.

Sidenote: I don't know if she has already in a relationship or what's her sexual orientation is. I couldn't find a photo of her with a guy.

I was wondering if you guys could tell me the number of cats I should be concerned about?

Australia AskMen says this:

&gt;Here’s an important distinction: One cat is — without question — 100% a redflag. We heard the term “crazy cat lady” a million times, but that implies that said lady must have multiple cats. We’re here to tell you that regardless of the number, there’s a good chance she’s crazy. You see, a woman who gets a cat generally does so to fulfill her desire to have a companion who allows her to remain detached from human relationships. She likes a cat because it never questions her and because she can pay attention to it on her own time. Does this sound like the type of lover you’d like? You’re better off cutting your losses before you have a runny nose, a handful of soiled kitty litter and a girlfriend who’s as cold as ice.

I don't know if I agree with that, I just put it there for a reference - but I do grasp the concept that cats are generally independent animals.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1153856,public,self,How many cats is a red flag when getting in a relationship with someone?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s8pxlz/how_many_cats_is_a_red_flag_when_getting_in_a/,no_ads,0.0,,,

Hey yall. I'm a college kid about to graduate soon. I've been struggling a lot with dating and also making female friends. I think it's because I grew up surrounded by men majority of time since I also went to an all-boys school in high school. I've been focusing a lot on setting my career up as a software engineer after graduating and have been doing well on that to make myself more attractive. I am also improving myself by working out to improve my physical and mental health. However, the only aspect in my life I struggle so much is relationships. I've never had one and my heart stings whenever I see couples together since I want to have that experience. I tried dating apps but I often get ghosted whenever I get matches. I'm not necessarily desperate to get into a relationship but I fear I may grow older being lonely and behind in the game of ""relationship/dating"". Do you think my career and money will make me more attractive later on? Idk what is it I'm doing wrong since I'm a nice guy too

Hi so I met a great lass a few days back while out for a few drinks we spoke for 20 mins or so. Learnt a little about her. She genuinely seems really nice and interesting. She took my phone and added herself to my Facebook. I plan on messaging her and have wrote up a few messages. I was hoping people could advise which message is better and if you have any advice of ways to improve the messages that would be great. 

I’m not so good at this sort of thing so I know I’m definitely overthinking things.

all of the said girls are school mates of mine, we all attend a private school so we all know each other, given the small amount of students, nevertheless i’ve scarcely ever interacted with them: 5 of them are in the same year as me (seniors) and the other 2 are underclassmen (juniors). 

the most i talked to the latter two was a few greetings and occasional small talk concerning the teachers, i know nothing about them.

i never led anyone on, neither have i manifested any type of interest towards them, so it was more than just a tad awkward to reject their proposals of going out (non-platonically), i’m not the best at being empathetic so it came as fairly tough to formulate genuinely understandable excuses and i’ve also ruined the pseudo-friendship (more like acquaintanceship) with 4 of them due to my lack of tact.

i wish they would elaborate on why exactly did they choose me, after i never showed the slightest attraction to either of them. i don’t concern myself with relationships and feelings at the time being, and i’ve made it clear various times, casually slipping it into conversations. 

i don’t regard myself above average, and i doubt it’s the money they’re going after, since most of the students here come from well-off upper middle class families able to provide them with whatever. i’m academically gifted, but i try my best to be distant in order to focus on my studies and avoid distractions such as this reoccurring incident that left me puzzled. 

i’m evidently not generalizing and i don’t believe that all girls behave the same way and take the same approaches, i’m just apprehended by the lack of reasoning behind the repeated asking outs, even after showing myself as both uninterested and uninteresting. 

i’m quite bland and career-oriented, so i don’t even have a large friend circle or attend gatherings or parties. 

as odd this might sound, i would like to stop losing friends and cutting ties with potentially useful in the long run acquaintances due to this entire masquerade of hormonal teenagers, but how?

A year later, I'm back in the university and I'm in the same building with the guy friend and we we're talking casually when he started talking about him having to work on himself because he was in pretty bad shape last year (because of the breakup). And I - unwittingly - just blurted, ""ohh yeah, i know, im sorry that was a tough time"" and realized that I was not supposed to say that but i said it already. He was puzzled because he had only told G. So I just said, ""G told me ... some things. But it's okay, i understand, it's fine"" and had to find some lame excuse to leave.

Between then and March I applied for a job in Germany and got it, ready to leave at the end of October 2021. I also downloaded bumble and tried to get myself out there and meet new people, but it didnt really work. In March 2021, A reached out to me after months of no contact to talk about where it had gone wrong and wanted to be friends as we had a lot of history together and comfort. A is incredibly close to me having been with me for so many years, a wonderful person and I enjoy spending time with her. Around that time I was still on bumble. In March I made a move on A as I still loved her and wanted her back. At the end of March I also asked this girl (B) out on a date. B said she couldn't as she has exams but we swapped numbers. From March to April, A and I rekindled and decided to give it another go for the summer before I leave. At the end of April B texted me asking to go on that date I asked her on and I agreed, despite rekindling with A, who believed I was serious and exclusive with her. I kissed B on that date, finding her attractive, wonderful and truly enjoyed spending time with her. B said we will meet again once she finished her remaining exams and I agreed. B believed I was just a single man on bumble.

I continued to keep rekindling with A, we told our families we were together again and planned a weekend trip. I agreed to go on a second date with B after my weekend trip with A. From mid-May till end of October when I left for Germany I dated both A and B-without either of them knowing of the other. A always believed I was exclusive with her as that was the impression I gave her, and she would have dinners with my family. B and I established exclusivity in July when I agreed to it, and she believed we were exclusively dating. I kept B a secret from my friends and family-she didn't question it as our relationship was still new, and hid her when my parents were around at all. B would sometimes question-saying she felt like a secret, but I'd lie and appease her. Once she found A's name on my phone but I told her we were just exs who were friends. She told me to tell her if I ever saw A again, but she didn't mind if we met. I didn't tell her anything more. I told everyone I was dating A. A had no reason to question me.

I told both girls we would remain friends once I left for Germany, and that we were dating for the summer. I slept with both girls-for B it was her first relationship and first time. A and I went on a two week holiday which I told B I had done with a friend. A never knew I was seeing B at all, and would tell her I was seeing a 'friend' when asked what I had done in the week. I took leaving presents from both people. Both of them told me they would hold a torch for me and hoped to date me again once I returned. Once I was in Germany I kept contact with both of them and texted them often, planning to see them in the holidays. I even planned a trip with A for the current year.

I kept this going up until November when B was sent a photo from a distant mutual friend of a photo of A and I from holiday which A had posted. Up until which neither had any idea. I lied to B telling her A just happened to be there. She called me the next day asking again with more evidence-to which I lied again. She sent me a letter two days after telling me how hurt she was that I was lying and that she had more evidence. I realised I would have to and confessed to her the next day. She was incredibly upset and heartbroken. B ended up finding A's contact through social media and called her that night to tell her. I planned to and told A the day after who was equally heartbroken. I also told my family the next day about the whole thing. Both A and B have left me and have gone no contact, which I totally understand.

In all for six months or so I had two girlfriends and was cheating on them both with neither of them knowing. I truly had fallen for, loved and valued both girls. I found the whole double life exciting and enjoyed living in a lie. I thought because I was only in the country for so long that I would take some risks and liberties this summer. I feel terrible for the way I treated them and am haunted by my actions. I did it all the expense of them both and have proven to be a compulsive liar.

Well this goes on for about three months. I realized how much I like this girl, but obviously I didn’t want to rush into anything and put our jobs on the line. So after like 3 months I start hinting at us going to do something super casual and she said she was down. A couple weeks after that I asked if she wanted to go to the science museum (we’re in the engineering field). She says she had plans with someone that day and suggested we go another time. 

This all sounds great right? Well ever since then (about two weeks ago now), she has not texted me once, she has cut down on our daily chats a lot. We used to sit and talk for 10-15 minutes at a time, now it’s 1-2 minute small talk chats. I asked if work was busy she said it’s not bad, so I’m just really confused what is going on lol. 

I can’t go and ask her this, as I don’t want to make anything awkward between us. But after two weeks of this is there anything I should do or should I just chalk it up as an L and move on?

My boyfriend (25) and I (25) have been dating for almost 4 years, and this is my first ever boyfriend ever meanwhile he has a handful of ex’s under his belt in which he claimed they all cheated which left him broken. They were all the “crazy ex’s” and the ones who did him dirty. I genuinely believed him and all his stories and I thought he wouldn’t do the same to me but I went through his phone 4 months ago and saw he was asking a moderator on a Reddit page if he had a mega thread of this lady’s nudes, and he went on her page leaving a comment saying “holy fuck I want to fuck you” that comment broke me into pieces because this is a comment of a man who claimed to love me unconditionally to the point he stopped liking photos of women on his Instagram, he told me he wasn’t like his family members who are all cheaters, and just would make me feel as if I was literally the only woman who he needed sexually (even though I throw in that he can watch porn he still denied it because he said he felt uncomfortable watching it while being in a relationship)

So, with all that we had a rough couple of months and I am still dealing with the insecurity of this. I know it was a simple comment and he didn’t do anything physically it still broke me that he really hurt me in that way when we live together and he had the courage to send a message like that when I never in a million years would send anyone a comment like that. 
I’ve dug myself into a hole where I check his social media and his followers and check his photos to see who has liked it and who he doesn’t follow back. I screenshot 25+ Female accounts who were all showing too much skin or just wasn’t following him back. I know i cannot get mad at the fact he did stuff before me, but I keep finding old DMs or old emails of him making sexual advances on people and he went on Craigslist to send emails to people asking for sex. I saw a DM earlier while I was going through his phone that he had paid 6 dollars for a nude of this girl, and was asking if he can pay her 120 if she let him play with her boobs. These are all on his phone still and I’m honestly uncomfortable, but I’m so done bringing up useless things up that aren’t worth bringing up since yes I do understand it’s the past, but I made sure to delete all my old Dms and erase people who weren’t needed on my social media but it seems that he follows the girls still in which he stopped liking their pictures. I went through his Liked Photos from before we were dating to see who’s pictures he’s been liking of girls he follows and to be honest it seems like it’s most of them and now I’m just so conflicted as to what goes on through his brain because i wonder if he has people on there who he has messed around with or something. 
I’m tired of this insecure feeling but I know I chose this life because I chose to stay after the whole situation. 
We clearly have a lot to work on, but I want to go about this the right way because we had suck a dark time and he was going to school which was affecting him so he kinda gave me an ultimatum that he has to think about his school first, and mentioned if we keep fighting we may break up but that that’s the last thing he wants to do. I clearly want to bring up the DMs and emails but I don’t want him getting all weirded out that I know, but honestly I just feel like he was just always making advances on Instagram towards girls and I’m just afraid that he’s not the person he says he is.

But one thing that really has bugged me and makes me feel even more sad about the situation is how highly he told these girls he’d eat them out and how much he loves doing it but then there’s me literally begging for it and still not getting it.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1153892,public,nsfw,I think I dug myself into a dark hole after finding out my boyfriend left an explicit comment under a sex workers photo,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s8t1vj/i_think_i_dug_myself_into_a_dark_hole_after/,no_ads,0.0,,,

Once that  happens  she starts taking them to places like malls, Sephora, various   restaurants, theme parks, makes them pay for it and keep telling them   that she will be telling her family to get engaged, but in reality all   of what she says is nothing but lies and complete opposite of what she   initially says - she never settle on a word and keep changing what was   discussed at first as once she is bored from that guy she then wants to   jump to the next guy to drag them along using  same techniques  (she've   done this with many other guys but two of my friends are the one that   fell for it, one fell really bad and the above is a reflection from his   story and there is more, but the 2nd one caught her lies on Salams and   blocked her before meeting her.)

Now   with all of that says, keep in mind that she is in her thirties and  she  on a constant cycle to do this - I'm not saying to make myself  sound  like a hero but I'm trying to help some guys who are pure and  looking  for a serious relationship to know that there are some crappy  and  unethical people like this one out there - she liked me on salams  but I  knew the story so I blocked her and reported her right away.   Salams/muzmatch don't perform any checks to the members they have in   there and they chase one thing which is profit.

Once  that happens  she starts taking them to places like malls, Sephora,  various  restaurants, theme parks, makes them pay for it and keep  telling them  that she will be telling her family to get engaged, but in  reality all  of what she says is nothing but lies and complete opposite  of what she  initially says - she never settle on a word and keep  changing what was  discussed at first as once she is bored from that guy  she then wants to  jump to the next guy to drag them along using  same  techniques  (she've  done this with many other guys but two of my  friends are the one that  fell for it, one fell really bad and the above  is a reflection from his  story and there is more, but the 2nd one  caught her lies on Salams and  blocked her before meeting her.)

Now   with all of that says, keep in mind that she is in her thirties and  she  on a constant cycle to do this - I'm not saying to make myself  sound  like a hero but I'm trying to help some guys who are pure and  looking  for a serious relationship to know that there are some crappy  and  unethical people like this one out there - she liked me on salams  but I  knew the story so I blocked her and reported her right away.

Lot of prefacing going on here, I hope you’ll follow and possibly drop some sage advice. I read a lot of these posts but haven’t ever felt compelled to dump about this but between me, a therapist and two friends, I’ve kept it to myself and it’s been burning a hole in my heart since then. 

Despite therapy and medication, dated some since then, moved away, I still find myself ruminating about a missed connection from 3.5 years ago. I was working a temp role at a marketing firm. I had exited very draining professional network after 4 years. Burned a lot of bridges with toxic people that never really connected with. Didn’t realize that these avoidant maneuvers because habits and compulsive behavior.

I was one of 3 men on my floor. Lots of distractions, lots of flirty banter all the time. Hard to distinguish what was intentional and what was just for fun (by default, but I also have ADHD). About a month in, a girl from a pod over from me makes the boldest move I’ve ever been approached with and I was SHOOK. 10/10. Most beautiful woman I’ve ever met. Kindest eyes. SHOOK.(My issues with confidence have transformed since then, I hadn’t had a lot of fruitful romantic experiences before then.) we’d chat every now and again. I definitely missed some other cues from her over the next few months. Around that time, I ruptured my Achilles’ tendon, full tear during  a soccer game (soccer is a big deal to me, I’ve been playing since I could see over a ball) Surgery. A mountain of medical debt that I JUST paid off recently. I seamlessly became dependent on opioid painkillers for about 6 months (Oxy, not even once). I was a mess. I had barely been holding my life together, flying by the seat of my pants trying to tough it out in a big city (I’m from a small town) with big rent and big egos a plenty.

I was allowed to work remotely until I could walk (about 6 weeks).

I knew my life was gonna be rocky for a while. Confidence shook. I’ve been a runner and athlete my whole life. All of a sudden I couldn’t decompress stress and ruminating thoughts with a long run. Oxycodone had me drowsy all day. Sleep schedule was fucked.

TW TW TW! 

Was doing a lot of *ideation* everyday of my recovery. Mac Miller (a huge musical inspiration of mine) passed from an overdose in that period of time. I didn’t realize that my already fragile self esteem was resting upon my physical ability. Sitting on my bed for 6 week, I had a lot of time to think. Realized that this co worker might actually like me but it had been months! Figured she was probably over it.

Came back to work and on the second day, we arrived at the same time. She approached me and was as sweet as anyone could be. Asked me constantly how I was doing over the next month. We got more conversational. I felt like I was almost ready to open up (I also didn’t realize how many mental walls I had up). Maybe a month or two from then? I started thinking about my approach. An apology for being standoffish and oblivious before, followed by a pitch to ask her out. (It take me weeks to build this).

I was frequently applying to jobs the entire time, in addition to lobbying for a role at the marketing firm more akin to my skill set.

A few weeks back in the office, and one of my managers let me know that my last day was that Friday. I immediately called my recruiter, no response. Email bounced back. Called the agency and they informed me that she moved on to another job elsewhere. She had been negotiating my contract extensions month after month. I foolishly assumed I had a few more months of runway. 

Ever been ghosted by a recruiter at the worst possible time? I already had enough stress to keep me up all night. Now I had to scramble for a job. Hella medical bills (because Medicare in America is an abyss of misery), and of course all of my regular bills.

Thanks to therapy and lots of reflection, I now know that a great deal of my self worth is also tied to career. This stemmed from a financially unstable childhood, and hence anxiety about it in my adult life.

I was DOWN BAD. I knew that if I opened up to anyone at the time, they would see the mess of my life. Not just the injury, but several factors that I failed to confront in my early 20s.

That leads to my first question: let’s say you are interested in someone but you’ve sustained  shots to your confidence overs very short period of time. I’ve dated since then but I worry that my anxiety will get the best of me once again in the future.

How would you approach someone who is interested in you and is anticipating for you to ask them out when your life is an absolute dumpster fire?

And the next part is what I really regret. I was very vulnerable at the time and I burned bridges just to hide from everyone, including the co worker I was into at the time. No one deserves to be cut off like that. Of all the bonds I managed to repair, I received a great deal of honest feedback. I realized how invisible my irritability, impulsiveness, and irrational behavior had been to me while on display to anyone who cared about me.

Second question: would it be insane to reach out after 3.5 years to apologize for something so egregious? 

I imagine this person would be compassionate and empathetic to an extent while also acknowledging deep contempt for my behavior. I also don’t want to come off melodramatic or like a stalker! It’s been and I imagined on. I just want to be honest about my remorse. I feel like they deserve that much. 

TL;DR: I made a mistake a while ago and the regret only grows more by the year. I want to avoid this behavior and I also have a deep desire to apologize to someone I hurt.

so this has been weighing heavily on my heart this week.   


i'm in a situation of ""great guy, bad time"".   


i have a lot of baggage that he doesn't know about yet, and i'm not ready to let someone in on my problems. i just moved from colorado to a new state because i was being physically abused by my old roommate. i was also diagnosed with lupus and prior to my diagnosis, i had been fighting for my life in the hospital for weeks. i still struggle with my illness but i hide it the best i can. i also lost my job in the midst of everything. i have no money, or a place to call my own. i crash at my best friend's house.  


i'm getting back on my feet by following my dream of being a digital artist, but im scared that calling myself an artist makes me seem lazy and unstable. i'm scared that it makes me look unattractive.   


but despite my insecurities, we've been on 3 dates that have gone so well! hes so open minded, hard working, nerdy (my favorite thing about him is when he goes on little history tangents), and of course i think hes so handsome too.   


but every time we go on a date, he spends more than i can afford. he wants to take me to get massages, and eat at the nicest restaurants... and i feel horrible that i can't even offer to split the bill with him. i hate feeling like this. i don't want him to think that i expect this from him all the time.   


one time, i explained to him that i don't make as much as he does, and i told him a little bit about how im starting over in life. he then reassured me that i shouldn't worry at all, because when he moved here from holland, he had nothing. he worked as a bus boy before he owned two businesses, and for that reason, he doesn't care how much i make.   


well fast forward to today-- he just sent me a voice message asking me if i am free this weekend.   


my heart says YES! i miss him and i would love to see him again. but my brain says that i should tell him im busy because i can't offer to pay. and i should stop dating in general until i get back on my feet.

But he was persistent. For two weeks he sweet talked me and begged me to let him come over. Now, at the time, I was suffering from chronic gastritis which the doctors hadn’t yet diagnosed because they are incompetent useless pricks, and so l was in constant pain and was basically laying up in bed all the time. I told him this, I told him he wasn’t gonna get what he wants, that he was gonna be bored, I mean it. Well, eventually I gave in. I went and picked up the looser with no car. Back at my house he shared some of his medical weed with me, I’ll never forget how it numbed the pain for a while. It was the first time in days where I didn’t feel physical pain. So I was beginning to relax, and we were cuddling, and as you’d expect, this kids hand is starting to creep down my pants. So I sat up and said
“I told you I’m not that kind of girl. If your bored then you can fucking leave.”
“No, I’m sorry.” He says with the puppy dog eyes. “I just want to cuddle I promise.” 
Honestly, so did I. I didn’t trust this dude but sometimes a girl just wants a little comfort. So sure enough, few minutes later, he tries again. I smacked him. He later told me that he was impressed by this, that no other girl had ever reacted that way to him. But In the moment he was flabbergasted.
“Do you want to try something scary?” I said.
“What is it?” He muttered. I responded with “Do you like being choked?” He said
“No, I don’t. Please don’t choke me.”
I respond “okay, well I told you I don’t want to be touched.”
He hits me with the “let’s just cuddle” and hugged me. So, sure enough, his fingers are wondering again so I sat up and said
“Look, If your gonna do somthing I don’t like, how about I get to do somthing you don’t like?” He agreed. So I got behind him and slipped my arm around his neck. I took my other arm and placed that hand on the back of his head. I told him “tap out when you’ve had enough.” He confirmed, and I started to squeeze. He didn’t tap out. In 15 seconds his arms and legs started to jerk rythmicly. Immediately I let go, and I did what I always do- I sat him up and started rubbing his chest. This stimulates the body and  always causes them to wake up right away. He stopped ceasing, but he wasn’t breathing. Eyes closed, completely limp. So I lifted his head under the chin to open his airways and was telling him to breathe while rubbing with the other hand. Without opening his eyes, his hands jumped up making a futile attempt to fight me- but he was weak and really incoordinate, the man wasn’t fully concious by any means. I told him it’s okay, that I’m not trying to hurt him. It took probably around 45 minutes for him to come out of this. He got to a point where he was sitting up, supporting his head in his own hands, but I was watching him closely. He would take a couple breaths and stop. So I would rub his back to remind him and he would take a couple more breaths. As it turned out, he had hydrocephalus. He eventually recovered, if he didn’t I wouldn’t be telling you this obviously. And ironically, ever since then, this dude came back every single day for a summer and half the winter. I actually ended up catching feelings for this guy, and finally when I was fully invested turns out he was involved with his best friend.

We both caught feelings and things started to get more serious around November. However, as soon as I started questioning what we were, FWB decided to put a halt to it. He said we should create distance, talk less, and see/have sex with other people. I didn't really want to since I had been pushing for a relationship but I also didn't know when FWB would make up his mind. I decided to explore how being with other people would make me feel and assumed FWB was doing same and one day we might come back to the relationship thing. We didn't create great boundaries and FWB kept acting like we were in a relationship even though he kept claiming it wasn't he wanted. He implied he was jealous every time I mentioned I was on a dating app etc but equally putting distance between us and spending less and less time with me. He also mentioned he was still talking to his ex. I started hooking up with my roommate who I had hooked on and off with in the past thinking nothing of it. Neither my roommate nor I have feelings for one another. However, something about it didn't feel right and I started to feel intense guilt because I realized I really had strong feelings for FWB. One day after avoiding me seeing me for a month and cancelling plans, FWB tells me he saw the ex and she tried to kiss him but he felt so bad he didn't and realized he liked me. Idk what possessed me, but I told him I was hooking up with my roommate. I thought it was the right thing to do because I wanted to share that I didn't like where things were going and I really felt like I liked him. FWB instead reacted vy losing his shit. He started claiming I tried to make him jealous and acted like I cheated on him even though we weren't in a relationship. He said I should have known how I felt and ""no sane person would ever do that"". I felt fucking gutted because this whole time I wanted a relationship with him and I was only going along with what I thought he wanted and protecting my own feelings. I kept asking him if he could take time to think about it and he said ""Nothing can ever fix this and I can never forgive or get over it."" He said we couldn't stay friends and ended up blocking me on everything. I feel so heartbroken because I would never cheat or hurt someone. He also made so many promises to me and then they never happened. I thought I did something that was ok.

It’s been years and I still feel shattered. I really thought I would marry him and have babies, and I didn’t even want any of that before meeting him. I could waste my life away wondering why I wasn’t enough, but it’s pointless. I just wasn’t. There’s no easy answer. He just didn’t think I was special.

So my question is, how can I feel desirable again when the only person I’ve ever truly desired didn’t want me? I know I’m attractive, but I don’t feel desirable. I don’t feel special. I don’t feel sexy. I feel like a faulty, returned item.

Ever since, my attraction to other men has gone down so much that it’s almost nonexistent. I haven’t felt anything real for anyone since, even when other men I’ve dated since have told me they loved me. I feel hollow inside.

I still cry myself to sleep some nights and it doesn’t help that I see him in my dreams. I wish I never met him. I wish I never knew he existed. I don’t get why love made me so broken when it’s supposed to make you happy.

Does it ever stop hurting? Does it ever go away? Do you ever regain attraction to others? I don’t want to spend my whole life feeling like a reject, unable to let anyone else in. I don’t like how ugly I feel and how nothing helps. No matter how many times people tell me I’m attractive and a total catch, I know he didn’t think so. It’s like a knife in my stomach every time. 

It just hurts so bad and feels like there’s no end in sight.

I will say I’m unlucky, I don’t think dating is this hard for the average person. In fact, most people have it easy as long as they’re attractive. Since I’ve been on dating apps on and off for years, that’s the only way I’ve met people but I just never catch a break. The one time I saw someone short term, it felt like settling because no one else gave me attention &amp; he wasn’t physically attractive to me but treated me okay. I always get pursued by the ones I don’t want, if they’re attractive they’re dicks or there’s no connection OR if they’re good looking but decent personality they’re too short for me. 

Sometimes the guys on dating apps message and we speak for a little while, but things fizzle out. Out of no where in some cases, they reach out again and come across as unstable or a total asshole wanting to rub something in my face. Look at last post, is this standard of dating apps or am I unlucky?

Like, we went to a movie tonight and we were the only ones in the theater, which was great because we just laughed and made fun of the movie the whole time. At one point, I saw that he was about to grab my hand but then stopped himself. On both dates, when he walked me to my car, I felt like he wanted to kiss me but didn't.  And I get the feeling that he's maybe lacking the confidence to make a move or maybe he's not sure how I'd feel about it.

I kinda want him to make that first move because it's that confidence in a man that I find sexy. And I do feel like having that first kiss will give me what I need to know if he and I just have a friend vibe or if it could be more. I guess I'm stuck because I don't want to lead him on by being the one who goes for the kiss first if I end up then feeling that I'm not feeling the chemistry, but i do want to make him feel comfortable enough to go for it. I know this probably all sounds ridiculous; it's late and I'm half asleep and not getting the words out the way I want lol.


Would it be a good idea to suggest to him a dinner date this time, so we can actually sit across from each other and talk properly and see if we can build a bit of intimacy (I obviously won't say the part about intimacy lol)?

I’m  a Heterosexual male but I'm sure many of the man here can relate to  this story but they will never tell. Some are married, have girlfriends  or Major players.

One day I was on  a dating site and I seen this Transsexual I was really attracted to her  and she was attractive she didn't really look like a man, tall tan skin  long brown hair  she looked so beautiful  we spoke, she sent me a few  xxx pictures that turned me on a lot I don't know why but there is   something about a feminine woman with the same thing as me (tools) if  not bigger so I met with her one day after work I went to her  place I  remember her sitting on the pink bed asking me what am I into what do I  want to do and I \[paused\]  and slowly I just  pull  down her grey  legging shorts  and I started rubbing her stick  as hers  grew  mines   grew I was really really turned on there's no feeling that would amount  to that Rush OMG.

what to expect  not knowing just a rush of energy flowing through your body excitement  like a DRUG of anticipation  so I begin to go down to my knees for the  first time, in a lustful manner. Guys imagine Kylie Jenner with a nice  tool ……. 9 out of 10 will do.

I  did what I did but it felt funny and it tasted funny but the degree of  lust I had for her over powered my hesitation. Then I proceeded to have  sex with  her as she jacked her P3%i$  she came,  She came heavy , i  proceeded to do the same then  I kissed her on the cheek and left . I  don't know what I felt I felt so weird I was hoping no one saw me come  out of her place …….as I walked to the car not knowing what to feel  years ago.

As time progressed I  fed my desire of lust fullness with more transsexual porn and escapades  Im fully confident in my sexual decisions now but I make sure its  meaningful I love Women and Trans-women and i made damn  sure my partner  knows and understands and in return Ive let her express her sexual  desires. Honestly who am I to judge so many couples have individual  desires that they will never express to one another I can now say i have  achieved that with my partner ….

I'm a very choosy and high standards sort of person. So, before this incident, had only had sex with one person - my ex of many years. I wouldn't say I'm a ONS sort of person. Anyway, I met this guy online, and we immediately hit it off. Looking back, I can say he was talking about himself nonstop, trying to tell stories/ make himself look good. He also asked to hop bars from the original one I chose, using excuses such as 'I don't like the vibes here' or whatever. We bought a bottle and by the time he got more drunk I'm pretty sure he was pouring me drinks without asking me.

Because I was naive, I didn't think much of it, and didn't think of the connotations when I agreed eventually to be isolated. I could have backed out at any point, but for some reason his charm didn't make me feel uncomfortable. We sat and talked on our own somewhere for a bit, and in the back of my mind at this point I had alarm bells, but by this point I was so drunk + thought he was at least bearable and we got along okay so I just wanted to talk to him more (you wouldn't believe the amount of men I've met who've immediately annoyed me by being assholes in one way or another. I was raised to have high standards for politeness etc). He kept pouring my drink up to the brim, without ever offering me water. At one point I realised I shouldn't drink more, and offered him the rest of it, and he said 'that's yours. I'm already drunk. You know how to down a drink, right?'. So I did - because I'm actually fairly heavyweight as long as it's over a long period of time. I did tell him this, so it's extremely suspicious that when I agreed to go to his (again, he made up an excuse for this, to avoid freaking me out, I guess), again, without asking me, he poured more drinks for us both. After he'd already refused to drink mine. Of course at this point I knew the connotations of my decision, but I also thought I could say no, but when it came to it, I found I... couldn't? When asked for consent, I just said 'if you want' and 'I'd be willing to try'. It was absolutely not enthusiastic. If I was sober, I wouldn't have said yes. I only agreed because I was too drunk to care and some people-pleasing part of me couldn't find the words to say no.

So I wrote my number on the receipt, told her to let me know if she'd like to join me and handed her the receipt with my number on it.

A couple days later she messages me with an inside joke her and I had so I recognized it was her. We chatted and joked very briefly (2-3 messages) but I got straight to the point straight away and asked her about going out dancing with me as I'm a fairly busy guy and don't like dealing with texting games back and forth.

She ignored the message for about a day, then the next day she responded with an apology saying that she was running errands for her cat all day (I know, it's just a test to see if I'm the kind of guy to double text and/or get pissed off that she's ignoring me).

I politely tell her not to worry about it and that I understand how important pets are. Then I left her the address to the dance class and the time it started and told her when I'd be there in case she'd be interested in joining me for the dance class and to have a nice day otherwise. She responded with something about her cat and I just ignored it.

The next day she asked me about if I went to the dance class. We joked and chatted for a bit:

Me: You missed out in a fun class and good wine
Her: I don't care. there's a lot of nice places that serve wine.
Me: I imagine there are but there aren't many places where you can enjoy my sexy dance moves and a cup of wine at the same time.
Her: hahaha what kind of sexy dance moves?
Me: that's a secret but if you wanna know, what days are you free this week
Her: umm... im free to tomorrow night. I got some friends that wanna hangout but I'm not sure.
Me: That's fine. What you can do is hang out with your friends and afterwards I'll pick you up for dinner.


She then didn't respond for about 24 hours and just now texted me something funny but completely unrelated.

This feels like strike three, so I'm ready to just cut her off which is too bad cause I was really into her, but I don't appreciate her dodging the question everytime I try to ask her out. I'm not interested in being her friend or texting buddy. 

What's a better or more tactful way to say, 

""Listen, I'm not interested in playing these texting games or anything platonic. I'd like to take you out for a nice date and get to know you better. If you're not interested, that's fine. I'll leave you alone. Let me know if you change your mind. Take care.""

So, 2 weeks ago, I met this girl for the first time, after we had been texting over insta,  and I think it went pretty well. We both had a lot of fun and she then gave me her phone number. After that we texted a lot, not every day because we are both pretty busy, but I try texting her as often as I can. Last Monday we met again, and we went to a park, we talked there a lot, mostly about silly things. We started cuddling because it was cold and then we went for a walk and we started holding hand. I didnt kiss her though for which I feel really stupid. The days after we texted again about funny topics and so on.

Now for the thing I am actually here. Today I called her, we talked for a bit and then I asked her if she is free tomorow. She asked me what we would do and I told her we would go for a nice walk. She suddenly told me her best friend (female btw) asked her and she declined, she does not like walking in the cold. And I think here starts the part where I might have messed up.

I tried to convince her to still come with me in a funny way. But my fear is that I started to sound too disapointed. She told me we can meet another time, and I just went with it and said „ya another time 😒“ then we talked for a few minutes and then we hang up. Later she wrote me the same, that we can meet another time, and I said yeah lets do it before changing the subjuct.

We had been ""friends"" for 2 years prior. We were never best friends, or close, I saw her once a week for school. I was dating someone else at the time. The summer prior to us dating we talked every day 24/7 for 2 months however our conversations were 99% ""bullshit"" or ""fluff"" pass times. Like critique on pop culture or shitty jokes. Nothing related to our personal lives, or likes or dislikes.

In July she drunk confessed that she'd been in love with me for 2 years. I decided to give the relationship a chance. Ever since we started dating we meet every other weekend. When we spend time together it's great. It's intimate. I was her first sexual partner. (The sex is great). We have conversations, go out for dates, but our conversations never break depth. She never talks about her ambitions, desires, goals. She won't even tell me if she got a new job unless I ask, nor does she talk about her home life. I don't know what music she really likes, what hobbies she has, whats her favourite food. All I know is she has 1 best friend.

When we aren't together we no longer text. She almost never initiates texts, never calls, we go days to weeks without talking.

Here's why I don't ask her directly;

The big plot twist to this whole thing. Whenever we're in person, she drowns me with compliments. She loves my physique, she likes that I'm smart. She tells me she's obsessed with me, that she thinks about me 24/7 and that she's so happy to be with me, shes horny around me and that she never wants to go. But it doesn't add up with her actions. If you like me so much why do you never text me? Why do you never call me? Why do you never share things about yourself to me? She didn't even want to disclose her birthday until 3 months in.

I've seriously never dated a girl like this before and it's confusing as hell. My female friends don't know what to tell me because they don't even have friends who behave like this. My male friends tell me to just enjoy the fact that a hot girl fucks me once a weekend and leaves me alone for the rest of the week.
