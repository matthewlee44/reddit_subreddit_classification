As a side note he is not the most attractive man in the world and a mutual friend of mine even made the comment “aren’t you a little out of his league?” But his behavior towards me made him attractive to me. After all I am just looking for someone who will be good to me. So all last week he was super attentive and sweet and we were intimate several times. He sent me texts like “I like you so much and I am so excited to see where this can go!” and “I love spending time with you!!” Fast forward to this week, his texting has totally slowed down minus the sweet pet names like “darlin” and “beautiful”. He has stopped texting me straight away in the morning and he even cancelled the plans that we had for tonight, knowing that I will get my kids back tomorrow night and won’t have a free evening for a while. I cannot wrap my head around his total 180 in behavior….. and I don’t want to come across as all needy and push him away any more….. I just don’t think this man is going to pull a woman any better than me… so I don’t think that that could be what he is thinking. I am attractive, have a great career and good character.

I’ve been single since I left my child’s dad at age 18 and every year passes by and I’m somehow still single. I’ve made tinder and bumble profiles but never really used them let alone met someone off there. I don’t really do much besides be a mom and work, I sometimes hang out with friends but haven’t been able to meet a guy this way. In the 5 years, I’ve only had 1 man come in my life that I actually really enjoyed being around but he ended up royally fucking me over. So it’s not like I’m out here going to pottery class every week or the gym, bar whatever to really even meet people. I have guys approach me from time to time but not super often and I’m usually not attracted to them physically or personalIty wise. I feel like it’s kind of insane to be single for 5 years, regardless of how much I get out of the house, and I very much don’t want to be single anymore. Like at all. I get super lonely from time to time thinking about it, to where there is a pit in my stomach. I just want to share a love with someone in this world to support each other in whatever way needed and I for some reason cannot find that. Many of my single mom friends have found partners so I no longer think that’s a huge reason why. Wtf is going on? Please help me with advice or insight.

Me: two things can be true at the same time. You don’t wanna date anyone in general and don’t wanna date me in particular

Me: I mean it kinda is. If you liked me enough you wouldn't want me touching another man   

Him: Bruh. I’m not getting into this. Again. No, I don't wanna date you. I’m sorry.   

Me: see this is all you had to say.  Did you ever even like me? Or did you say things like “I’m crazy about you” to try and have sex?  

Him: I did when it was just fwb casual thing.  Then it started getting too much  

Me: I mean not to make you feel guilty or anything. I was 18 (he was 27). You should’ve seen this coming. Did you really think I’d never get attached to the first man I touch. And you were never really clear. You said thing like “I’d marry you” “it’ll get serious in the future” “I’m attached to you and that’s why I don’t wanna lie”   

Him: well a lot changed since then  

Me: like? You really don’t think I deserve some kind of explanation?

This will be long, please bear with me.

I am a 24 year old guy who has absolutely no experience with girls beyond friendship, like seriously, none. I got my first hug this summer after hiking with a girl for a few weeks. I am a decent looking guy so I chalk this up to several causes. lack of exposure/options, late to the game, and introversion/slow to open up.

First off, lack of exposure. I am in a male dominated field and am in male dominated hobbies. I work in natural resources which is 90% male. Hobbies include, everything outdoorsy, from hunting to climbing to back country skiing. All of these seem to have very few girls. Even my guy friends say I am too outdoorsy for them most of the time, leading me to do everything alone. My social life is a small group that is extremely tight, we only really hang out with each other, and not often anymore. It is hard to break into new groups or to find someone to add to mine. This has caused me to have lots of acquaintances who I know but dont really ""know"" (if you know what I mean), they also aren't really willing to accept invitations.

Ever since I graduated college, my exposure to people in general has dropped even further, you just dont meet many people your age after school it seems.

Late to the game. I am a christian and every christian girl my age is married it seems. It seems like I have missed the boat and potentially missed the train that takes you to the boat. I have reached the age where having absolutely no experience is becoming an amber flag. I also am not really a church person and have never fit in with church groups or church people.

Introversion. I am NOT socially awkward or anti social. I in fact love social gatherings and meeting people. Its just that it sometimes takes me weeks to recharge my social batteries. I am generally perfectly happy alone or with a single every close friend. This further limits my lack of exposure.

Slow to open up. I have a hard time being flirty with girls before I am friends with them. I dont want to use the term demisexual (as I am not that), but I can relate to those people and that idea of needing to be close to someone before moving a relaitonship beyond a friendship. I also dont want to use the term friendzone, but it honestly feels that way most of the time. We become friends and then after some time, I think about asking her out as I start to develop feelings, but she only sees me as a friend. I have lost quite a few friends this way and frankly I dont want to lose any more and I feel broken because of it.

People are usually surprised when they ask about my girlfriend and they find out that I am single. I am told that I would make a great husband or that ""I just figured a guy like you was taken"". I have been also told that I am too genuine for my own good.

I have tried many things.

""Dont look for a relationship/be desperate, it will come when you least expect it."" - Thats how I ended up here. I lived my life though college and would say that I have lived a pretty good one. I dont want to sound like I have a large ego, but I really do have no regrets and have lived life to the fullest.

Online - nothing, no likes, matches or messages. I have had profiles reviewed and created by friends and reddit.

Therapy - I have been to a therapist in the past and all I got out of it was ""Some people are meant to be alone, we can work on ways for you to accept it"".

Friends - Friends/family etc have tried to set me up, but that has never led to a date, only lots of being stood up.

Getting out more - over the last year I have gone out to the local ""downtown scene"" with friends on a somewhat regular basis. Trying new restraunts, shops, etc. and generally getting out more. Though, I just feel too young for that crowd (surrounded by young families mostly), and too old for the college scene that exists.

Meetup - none exist in my area for things I am interested in, so I made one. A short hike to the top of a popular hill for the sunset and astronomy viewing. No one showed up.

I tend to be attracted to older girls since they are more likely to be in the same stage of life as me. What I mean is, I am 24, own a house, want to start a family and settle down as soon as I can. Not many girls my age (other than the allready married christians) are in the same boat. Many are still going out to parties and stuff and I just dont fit in with them.

So my questions stands. What would you recommend to a guy who is recently graduated and is hungry for a companion, to do to try to change my dating life for the better. Essentially something needs to change, but I don't know what.

Me: I keep forgetting but this weekend I could come by and get my glasses? You can put it in the mailbox if that’s easier. I can keep u updated though!

I offered to be her friend cause I know how being depressed and suicidal is, it's no joke, but she can't be just friends, she pushes it and if I don't reply fast she literally starts going off talking shit to me...

It is disheartening seeing how people can go about dating with such ease. Go in and out of relationships on a moments notice with little to no effort. Maybe not healthy or fulfilling, but I can't help to wonder where I am going wrong. I'm not going to dog myself, I do have some things going for me

- I wouldn't consider myself any worse than average looking
- 6'5, thin, but healthy nonetheless
- A sense of humor
-Kind hearted
-Really laid back
-A decent job working at TD Ameritrade, a house, a car, etc

My downfall is social anxiety, it has to be.... its my only explanation. I live in Omaha, plenty of people to meet here and places I can meet them, surely. I can never get the ball rolling with any one. I can't find myself capable of approaching someone that I find attractive, at a bar for say, for several reasons

-To be rejected in an attempt only discourages me more. And my encouragement is already near zero
- It almost feels rude in some matters, because more likely than not they came there to have fun in their own element and im invading/interrupting them
-I am bad at initiation
-I am not intuitive enough to lead a first conversation with someone with it being well planned out. You don't have time to plan it out and think straight having a conversation in person and on the fly. It can be good still. It will more likely be rocky 
-Of course they likely are seeing someone already anyways 

My obvious routes I try for are Tinder and Bumble like many others. I find it easier to start a conversation that way, but granted I get like one match a month on either and they likely don't reply anyways is just a waste of my time and energy. 

Im just stuck in a spot where I dont have the encouragement to continue on even though I desire to have a better half.

Im not the only one been though/going through this. What have you found success in?

I've been with my GF going on 2 years now and in a few short months we will be living together. I've been thinking about popping the question to her for sometime now and my original plan was to do it after we had been living together for atleast 6months or so to make sure everything is still going fine. Which I expect it to be, but, ya never know. Anyways, only thing I'm thinking is would this be a bad time to do it? Why I ask this is because I'm currently a returning student pursuing a healthcare profession that will be done with school in May of '23. Now I'll be working in the field prior to that, but money is and will be a little tight for me up until that point, but my GF is a successful individual who more than doubles my income so that's not as much of a problem. What I'm wondering is would it be wrong to ask her this while I'm still going through my transitional phase in my career dealing with school and all? Or should I wait until that's all said and done and we are planning to get a house and do all that other good stuff that comes with it? I just want to make sure I time it right and I wonder if from a female perspective that would look like I'm choosing the wrong time to make that decision. I just don't want to wait too long either, or make it look like I'm comfortable without the commitment.

I was already pretty sure I liked her, so I approached her in one of the classes, started talking, and eventually asked for her number. I gave her mine, then texted her that weekend. She didn't respond, but started staring more frequently. I unfortunately couldn't go talk to her anymore, and because of this I decided to try texting her again after a couple of weeks, gently asking if she didn't respond the first time because she didn't want me to talk to her. She didn't reply again, but then started staring at me pretty much any chance she could, and was fixing her hair at least once a class. I didn't think she wanted to talk to me, so I waited several weeks before doing anything, and she had been staring the whole time, even after we had a week off. I talked to one of her friends, and turns out she didn't text back because she has strict parents, and I think hasn't approached me because she's rather shy.

But, my schedule got changed so I don't have classes with her anymore.

1. Do I text her telling her I noticed her looking over last semester, and ask if she was looking over because she wanted to talk to me, if so I'm usually in the library for a few minutes after school.
2. I wait to try and talk to her in the hallways

I don't like trying to text again, clearly it's not a method of communication that works right now, but I know she will get the text and it is as quick as possible, and I want to act as soon as I can.

I don't want to wait any longer, but in person definitely is better. I don't see her in the halls every day, and she's often with friends and even if I do see her it's often brief and the halls are crowded. So, its not guaranteed at all I will get to talk to her if I see her in the halls.

There was one student--who is one year younger than me--that would regularly attend my office hours and stay after class just to talk with me. After my office hours, he would walk with me as I left and ask me questions about my life. I kinda figured he was interested in me, but I wasn't sure.

After the final exam, I left the classroom with the professor to go grade when I saw him sitting outside the classroom. I didn't think anything of it, but I got an email from him the next day explaining that he planned to ask me out to coffee but didn't want to put me in an uncomfortable position in front of the professor. He said that he was disappointed that he couldn't ask me in person, and he feared that he wasn't going to see me again due to the size of the university.

I thought it was sweet, so I agreed to go once his grade was posted. As a side note, he ended up doing pretty well. Anyway, we met for coffee, and he did everything right on paper. He got there early, dressed very maturely, greeted me outside the coffee shop, held the door for me, paid for my drink, handed my drink to me, and even walked me back to my car when the date was over. Once we made it to my car, he held his arms out and gave me a--very friendly--hug.

We also have a surprising (and almost strange) amount in common too. We're from neighboring cities; we both played woodwinds in the marching band in high school; we were both drum majors in marching band; we're both avid readers; we both have parents that divorced three years ago; we're both majoring in business; we both have an interest in similar philosophy; we both did debate in high school; we're both interested in classical music; we're both not interested in partying; and we both have one younger sister who is a freshman.

This probably sounds amazing on paper, but I just didn't feel a spark. He's conventionally attractive, smart, and seems to really care about me, but I just didn't feel anything. He told me that he was nervous at the beginning of the date, and I could tell. There were a few awkward moments where he blurted random questions and desperately tried to fill the silence. There were 3 or 4 awkward silences but the date went on for three hours, so that's probably expected.

The date largely consisted of him showering me with compliments--none of which were focused on my appearance. He repeatedly called me smart, praised my past accomplishments, and said that I was well-spoken. At the end of the date, he stared into my eyes and told me that he thinks I'm a great person. I later found out that his car had broken down, so he had to take an Uber. I also later found out that he had gone to the coffee shop days prior to ask the staff about the best time to come.

Since the date, he's sent me little texts asking how my New Year was, how work was going, and about books that I'm reading. He's quite possibly the sweetest guy ever, but I'm just not sure if I feel a spark with him. The date felt like a get-together between friends and a bit odd considering that I was his teacher a few weeks ago.

So, should I go on another date with him? I don't want to risk stringing him along and breaking his heart when it's even more attached to me. I also don't think that a spark couldn't develop.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1149500,public,self,"I met a guy who is super sweet, but I'm not sure if I'm attracted to him.

I feel exactly like I did before the relationship, young, single, and still searching for what I'm looking for. Do you think I'm being hasty if I ask a girl out at this point? Do you think she would be concerned if she ever learned that I technically asked her out only a few days after my last breakup?

Thankfully I got out before we got married. When we finally parted and I became single in 2018, I dated around and met a man I truly clicked with. We’ll call him Marcus. We grew very close and agreed to see each other exclusively. The catch is, I met Marcus on reddit due to shared hobbies and NOT because he was actively looking for a partner. When we met, Marcus had just moved into his own apartment and divorced his wife of 15+ years (He and I are 10 years apart in age). Marcus was very upfront about the fact that he was still processing everything and didn’t feel he could be in a full on relationship. But it was too late, we had became fast friends with a lot in common. I already cared for him a lot, so I stuck around. Subconsciously, of course I hoped that would change. He has 3 children from that marriage and is still very engaged in their lives so I did my best to learn how to date someone who is coparenting. *THIS was the issue that I struggled with* it’s hard as hell to respect a man’s effort to be a good dad actively participating in his children’s lives and trust that there is nothing between him and his ex anymore. But a year passed, and we had became so close that despite our busy schedules I would sleep over almost every night, we shopped together, went out at least once a week for a nice date, and texted all day when we were apart. Winter of 2019, I had began to lose hope because I felt like I was stuck and this was going nowhere. That January we had a series of long conversations and agreed sadly to sever ties because he still didn’t feel “ready” and needed to find himself. He was earnest with me about that from the start so..I can’t fault him. But I drew a boundary at that point that we couldn’t see each other any more because it was too hard for me. We stopped all contact and I even blocked him so that I would not her tempted if he reached out. Shortly after, the pandemic unfolded and I decided it was a great time to take a break from dating and work on myself.   Fast forward two years, I’ve never been happier. My mental health has improved drastically now that I’ve processed the unresolved trauma from my relationship with my ex fiancé. A few days ago out of the blue, I received a text from an unknown number. It turns out to be Marcus, and he has gotten a new phone number. I agreed to talk with him and he explains he also has had this time to work on himself and figure out what he wants his life to look like in the future. He tells me he never stopped thinking about me during our time apart. He feels that if we were to revisit things again he is open to a committed relationship and he’s ready to see where it goes. So here I am at a crossroads. At my age, I know it’s very common for men to have children from a previous relationship. Previously when Marcus and I were involved, it was easy to stay detached from his life with his kids. Now looking at the prospect of being in a long term relationship with him I know that means actually being present in his childrens lives and coexisting with his ex wife periodically. I’ve never done it before and I’m wondering whether I CAN do this.   Need some advice and shared similar experiences.

We lived together before Covid happened, but in the first year of the pandemic a lot of obvious incompatibilities became clear with us spending so much time alone together. We had collectively talked about things not working out multiple times, but he ultimately pulled the trigger.

I took the breakup a lot harder than he did, but we somehow managed to remain friends afterwards. He’s from another country and doesn’t have family here. We have mutual friends and used to work together too.

We regularly update each other on our lives, give each other advice, and help each other out from time to time. We’ve remained each other’s emergency contacts, or person of reference for jobs. At no point in the last year did we try or talk about romantically reconciling. 

Honestly in the last year it has been incredibly platonic between us… but because we haven’t gone more than two weeks without exchanging some sort of communication with each other since we broke up, no one believes that we are over each other. 

I am ready to date again, but have come across this being an issue with pretty much every suitor. It becomes an ultimatum that makes me extremely uncomfortable, and I get sad thinking about not having my ex in my life anymore. I really value his friendship, and it feels like we are two friends that got back together more than exes. At the same time, I understand why its a red flag and am feeling very conflicted about having to cut him out in order to prove that I’m over him.

I am talking to someone now who I like, but he’s told me there is no chance of a serious relationship with my ex still in the picture. It’s not the first time someone has said this to me.

( Long story short- i had a great first date with a guy and now he’s ghosting me. Should i try to reach him? I really like him tho 🥲)

So i met this guy on a dating app and we had our first date 2 days ago. We decided to go and eat some sushi at a restaurant. The atmosphere was very chill and we had all kind of conversations that we both enjoyed although we were kinda shy. After we finished eating, we decided to go for a walk but it started raining and since we were around his working place ( he’s a bartender ) , we went in for a little drink. After we both had a drink,  the tension and shyness were both gone. It was so much easier to talk to each other and we had such a great time , joking around and vibe on the music. It was clearly that we were both into each other. He even mentioned a second date. Time passes by, but its time for me to go home. He drives me to the train station where we hug and tell each other how much we enjoyed the night. I arrive home and i text him that im safe. He responds me and that was the last time i hear from him. I texted him my spotify playlist since he asked for it at the date but he never answers back. The next day, he posted a story on his instagram but still didn’t even seen my messages. I guess he’s ghosting me?? While we were at our date, he mentioned that he’s working on Saturdays and that i could visit him on his working time. I don’t know what to do .

Tl;dr at bottom
Quick background: since I (24m) left HS I’ve been in two different long term relationships with only maybe 6 months in between those. So it’s easy to say that I haven’t had any real experience in the dating world. Even more so with women I don’t already know.

I went on a date with a girl off tinder. Now, she wasn’t gonna be In town long and I knew that this date wasn’t meant for anything more than a hookup. I picked her up and we got food. Just based in replaying this date in my head I somewhat know what I need to work on and I’m sure I’ll find more tips in this subreddit for that. During the date she had asked if I had any plans after and I had said no. She then proceeded to say that she doesn’t neither although she should probably go home soon because (reasons). I kinda took that as a bad sign but we continued to talk and everything seemed to go well. I took her home dropped her off and she said she’ll be in town till a certain day.
The most embarrassing moment: I asked her for a hug when I dropped her off at home. (Someone kill me)
Skip a few days 
I had to ask her if it was as bad as it seemed to me. She said it went well but that she got the sense I was looking for something she wasn’t ready for.

So yea, this girl thought I was looking for a relationship because I lack the confidence to make a move. I want to ask her for another shot but I feel like I’ll seem desperate or idk what. Any tips on making a move? Dating is hard and I’m really trying to get out there. I’m not ugly. I know I’m not but I just don’t feel confident in myself.

Tl;DR: first date. We both just wanted to hookup. She got the opposite impression of me probably because I was nervous and didn’t make a move. Any tips on how to make the move to initiate it all?

After two weeks of knowing each other I mentioned how he was the only guy I was talking to (we were sleeping together at this point) and he said I’m the only girl he is talking to but that he is Not ready for a relationship. 

He told me that he just got out of a relationship a few months ago and they made the mistake of committing after only 4 weeks. But after that convo we still continued and he still treated me like a gf. But then he would go 2 weeks without making plans with me but still hitting me up. He would do random things like offered to send me over some money if he heard that I was running low etc. He would also randomly hit me up to do relationship type things. For example I met his boss and Another time his parents? I overheard him referred to me as his girlfriend to some people. 

So then I try to make plans with him the following weekend after meeting his parents and he tells me he will “let me know what he does”. That Saturday I ran into him at a bar and that night he takes me out to this five-star restaurant and spends so much money on me. 

Then he starts to go kind of distant again after that the following week. I end up asking him if he wants to go to this thing with me that following weekend. He basically ended up going out with his friends instead of me and didn’t bother texting me that. I sent him a text upset. He doesn’t reply to that. Then I text him and tell him that I am disappointed that he didn’t at least hit me up. He ends up replying that he’s really sorry and he knows he needs to do better.  I then text him again and tell him that “I know we are both not ready for a relationship but that I would like to see him more consistently” He doesn’t respond except for sends me a Snapchat? I text him again and He ends up replying “yeah I’m not ready for relationship right now but I Love spending time with you and always have a great time with you.” I replied back the same thing and we both agree that we’re going with the flow. So then the following weekend we end up running into each other at a party. Most of the party he was paying attention to me and we are spending time together then towards the end I started acting clingy and he was getting annoyed and I start crying and tell him “that I don’t wanna relationship and that I’ve been talking to numerous guys.” The following day I text him and tell him that “I’m not talking to numerous guys but we both have a right to talk to whoever we want” I tell him that I’m so sorry and he is the only guy I’m hooking up with.  he tells me that “everything‘s OK” Then I asked him if that evening he wants to meet up and he replies that he is going to stay in. So 5 days go by and it’s and we go the longest we’ve gone without talking to each other. Then he sends me with a Snapchat. And we have been back and forth snap chatting a little for two weeks. And then tonight I asked him if I could pick up my glasses I left at his place and told him “he could put them in the mailbox or whatever works for him.” He said okay and he is friendly but I was hurt he didn’t at least try and persuade me to come in and say hi. 
So now I just don’t know what to make of this.

I am decently attractive, but my ""glow up"" happened in college, so I lack experience from the ""younger days"". Anyway, while I have dated and had flings with many people in the past couple of years, NONE led to a serious, long term relationship. NONE! (longest lasted 3 months)

I met people irl and through dating apps, and while every person seemed promising and extremely interested in me initially, they almost always lose interest. Because of my dating patterns, people think I have commitment issues, but in fact, guys have ended things with me first, not the other way around. 

People around me describe me as a self-aware person, but I could never point to the reasons for my romantic failures. Below, I will try to list out my distinct characteristics / lifestyle patterns, in hopes that some of you, especially straight men, can help me figure out what could potentially be the issue.

- I prefer logical thinking over emotional thinking
- People always think I am extroverted, but I am introverted
- I work in finance and am considered relatively successful (not something I ever bring up though)
- I am very direct and honest; if I have interest in someone, I will always make a move
- People often describe me as funny 
- I love fashion, but my distinct style is not the most feminine 
- I am terrible at giving emotional advice, but I still try my best to have empathy
- I am independent
- I have hobbies that are generally considered more male-dominated (gaming, soccer, etc.)
- I am very confident and have high self-esteem, but definitely not ""braggy""; confidence I have is mainly internal confidence
- I love gift giving, but can lack in emotional-giving (if that makes sense)
- I am easily hyper-fixated on things (eating the same lunch every day for a year)
- I am a homebody",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1149549,public,self,why have I never been in a long term relationship?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rxzn17/why_have_i_never_been_in_a_long_term_relationship/,no_ads,0.0,,,

Second just a small request but i don't want to hear any jokes memes or people belittling me and none of that self improvement stuff either as I've already been doing that by exercising and going out of my comfort zone to try new things to take my mind off of how lonely I was without anyone to talk to 

Now that that's out of the way here goes i recently got my oculus quest 2 a month and a half ago and I've been having a blast with it since all i previously had was psvr on a ps4 pro i started playing vrchat immediately after beat saber and love it its seriously been helping me with my social anxiety its greatly improved my social interactions with people. 

but then I met this really awesome girl i won't say her name or username for safety reasons but we met in one of the more empty worlds that not a lot of people go to i was just exploring and she approached me since I have a bit of a hard time with approaching people who don't talk to me first we pretty much introduced ourselves in the most awkward way possible and just started talking about random crap as usual in vrchat and just hit it off right away while chilling and talking with a couple other random people and showing off our avatars and expressions on our avatars 

we've been hanging out a lot recently whether i invite her or she invites me either alone or with each others friends we've been world hopping from one world to another in vrchat and just playing games making jokes talking to other people and laughing over the dumbest things ever and just enjoying vrchat in general it's really been a lot of fun and one of the best experiences I've had in the virtual world. 

Recently we started talking over Instagram messages about random stuff as well as playing games together on our Xbox Ones which is really fun and it's honestly great having someone else to play Xbox games like phantasy star online or minecraft with since I'm the only one in my family and friend circle who gots an Xbox because most of them are on pc and Playstation. 

But Now that's enough exposition and it's about time i get to the point of this post. I really like her a lot and I really want to tell her how I feel about her and maybe go out or something like that but I seriously don't want to ruin this beautiful friendship that I just found without even looking i don't want to make things awkward between us and make things weird between each others friends as well I'm afraid of the rejection of her saying no and scared that she might just get with someone way cooler funnier richer. etc. she's also from Canada and I'm from the United States if I wasn't such a big coward and had the guts to say that I liked her and ask her out and if for whatever she said yes I'd seriously be willing to travel just to meet up with her we're also around the same age so there's no problem with that. 

Tell me guys Gals and non binary peeps what should I honestly do? 

again like I said at the beginning of the post I don't want any stupid jokes or memes only serious answers because if it isn't serious advice i will downvote and block you because I genuinely need help I've already talked with friends about it and they said to tell her but i just need an outside opinion",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1149549,public,self,First post here and I really need some serious advice.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rxzngn/first_post_here_and_i_really_need_some_serious/,no_ads,0.0,,,

Holy shit, is this just dating anxiety?

Nevermind, even though I'm posting anyway, I just realized the answer for me is probably FWB with clear communication and established boundaries... but then how is that any different from something just that bit more exclusive? I think what I'm mainly just afraid of is breaking someone's heart and feeling guilty for it, even though I know I can't control other people's feelings, or myself falling and the other person not returning it and then me empathizing so I can't even be mad for a second and just sad.

Even tho he disappeared completely even from socials. 

After a while, things got better,  talked about moving in together. Bit a month after, he decided to get a brand new car in the middle of the process. We couldn't go with previous plan of moving because he exceeded his budget by a LOT. Kept finding conversations with his ex and told her things about his job that he didn't tell me ( actually very important things ). He apologized cuz he didn't want to FU our new chance. (FYI. This conversation I found on our anniversary because his phone kept vibrating while I was waiting for him in the car, they where talking all day long and for a few weeks, he's done this before many times and not necessarily friendly conversation.) Apologized again. 

3 months after things are running like normal, but he's distant, never calls, he does text, but in a routine, like ""how are you, I feel bad, the day was good/bad, good night"" literally, drives me insane.

He told me the other day something that hit me so deeply. ""you've actually never done anything wrong to me"" and I thought it was sarcasm and he said that he said sincerely.

I (25F) met a guy (30M) on Tinder named Eric last month. We’ve been dating for a month or so before things stalled. I’m not sure what to do, so I’ll explain.

He has been open about his anxiety (it gets the best of him sometimes) and mental health issues, and so have I. We are both in therapy. Both of us are a little inexperienced (he just lost his virginity and I’ve only had one short term relationship). I don’t think these are serious issues or obstacles but maybe they are? 

While we’ve been dating, he hasn’t made any physical moves. All he ever did was hug me once and put his arm around my shoulder at the movies one time. When I asked him about this, he said he was super nervous to do anything. He also wants an emotional connection before things get physical with someone. I’m okay with this but I did wonder if he was actually interested in me or not.

He planned a date for NYE and originally we were supposed to go to an event in his city (and I would spend the night at his place). When we discussed it, I told him I was anxious because it could lead to sex? I didn’t want to put either of us in the position to risk something by having sex too early. He agreed that although he was hoping something would happen, it would be better to avoid going to each other’s houses. I also gave him the green light to kiss and hold my hand (basically affection) as long as we didn’t have sex.

We made other plans for NYE instead. The date was great and he was super affectionate, where before he was much more reserved. We kissed for the first time and it was fantastic - he said he was addicted to kissing/touching me. At the end of the night, we ended up making out. Things got intense in the car and he decided to finger me (which he has never done with a woman). I left the date feeling chipper - he was a gentleman and he had my consent for what we did.

The next morning he texted me with a lot of regrets. I was shocked because he thought I didn’t like what we did in the car and was only pretending to. He said he didn’t feel an emotional connection and that he was too impulsive and undisciplined. His exact words: 

“Yeah, you’re easy to kiss. You’re pretty and pretty hot. All your observations are very astute. I feel like I was just trying to be whatever you wanted me to be because it felt good. I may be overcomplicating things because I’m scared and sad and insecure. I feel like life is very complicated and gives us a limited number of chances, but fearing failure does not help. “

Y’all what do I do? I feel like he’s pushing me away for no reason? I can’t tell if he genuinely isn’t interested or if his anxiety is getting the best of him. He brought up some good points about safe sex and needing more structure, but I feel like this can all be resolved? I like him but i have no idea if I should fight for this or not 😭

We texted a lot and planned to meet up fairly quickly, but because of work I had to cancel last minute and she ended up leaving the state untill december on a trip she'd been planning, all before we could plan another date. Things kind of fizzled over text early on (she was in and out of service a lot) so I decided to just give her space until she got back. Fast fowared to December, I message and we meet and I take her out, and she's beyond amazing. The date goes well enough and we kind of awkwardly hug at the end and make semi plans to meet up again in the near future. But I screw up and psych myself out of messaging her for two weeks. 

This is right around christmas, so I'm telling stupid things to myself like ""I don't want to appear desperate so I'll just wait a little longer to text"" and ""It's christmas and I barely know her, will texting make me look more awkward?"" 

Anyway I finally get the the guts to tell her how I felt, and she tells me that she would have gone out with me again, but she's met another person. We wish eachother ""best of luck"" and other hollow niceties.

And that's the end.

And I'm so beside myself I can't even think. This girl is literally the most incredible woman I have ever met, and I let her slip away out of fear of looking bad.

We have been talking everyday since he first messaged me. We FaceTime, call, and text. Our relationship started off as friendly but moved more romantic/sexual. We are both attracted to each other. He’s always been very supportive, consistent, and easy to talk to. We have many similar interests. We were planning for him to come up in around 2 weeks, to visit me from another state. He lives about a 10 hour drive away. He even took a few days off of work. The intention was to start dating if everything works out and we like each other. He’s going to be taking up a new contract and we thought, if things work out, that we can start officially dating. He’d probably get a contract in a nearby state so we are only a few hours apart. We are both looking for something long term. Marriage, kids, all that. We have discussed what we both want before. 

The past few days, his responses have been slow. I understand that he has been busy with work but normally he’s pretty responsive even during his shift. He used to respond within 5-30 minutes and now it’s more like 30 minutes - 2 hours. It’s possible I’m just getting insecure. But I worry that he’s losing interest. Sometimes he’ll be more responsive when we get sexual. We are planning to talk tomorrow night and maybe get intimate over the phone. I want to discuss more about the trip then but I am confused. He hasn’t been as wordy or responsive lately. The “good morning beautiful” and “goodnight gorgeous” texts have nearly stopped but it could be my fault since I fall asleep sometimes without saying goodnight now.

We used to talk for nearly an hour about politics, hobbies, whatever. Even over text he would be there and respond immediately. 

We recently discussed physical boundaries if he visits in person, what I am and won’t be willing to do. Maybe I disappointed him since I’m not willing to go too far? Maybe he’s just comfortable with me now since we are so familiar with each other, he doesn’t feel the need to respond all the time.

Recently at work, we’ve gained a wonderful person to work with us from Seoul Korea. Her and I(22m) have been getting along very well and have a lot of interactions with each other. I’ve noticed that she tends to look at me when I’m not looking (I see it through my peripheral) and she like to touch me a lot( not perversely, just a hand on the shoulder or back etc). Recently, she’s been asking me some personal questions about family, relationships etc. Today however, she asked me how old I was and I told her “I’m 22”, and she immediately said “ 22!? See ya!” And then immediately backed up and walked away haha. When I immediately asked her about it, she didn’t reply and kept walking away. I really do like her though. After ~5 minutes, things were back to normal and she was friendly with me again, asking more personal questions. Also, I noticed she always asks me what time I’m off and gets a little upset when I have to stay longer than my intended shift( we usually end out shifts together but lately my boss has asked me to stay longer last minute). I understand there is probably an age gap but it’s something I don’t see as an inside because my parents are 8 years apart. 

Was she interested in me prior to learning about my age? 

How would I go about asking her to hang out? 

For reference, she has a YOUNGER sister currently doing a PhD right now, so she might be a lot older than me.

He was the one who kept pushing to connect, saying he wanted me to talk more. Finding all these things we have in common. They're things that really help me feel like myself (Zelda, anime, fantasy books) Commenting on the art I make, thought we shared values, humour. Getting emotional, saying ""I think you are wonderful"" telling me when he was sad too. The way he would compliment me and go CRAZY over me when it got sexual. It’s been a really hard time in general (we both work in the music industry). Thought we were leaning on each other.

He shouldnt have been getting all that if he doesnt want to commit.

In the end he was only doing supportive shit cause liked me as a friend. But if you want friends, you’ve got friends who you’re not intimate with…? I asked why he asked if I was lonely living alone. He said “I care about you! I wanted you to be ok”

But… he doesn’t care enough to risk losing me? He was always risking a friendship. He was trying to say we were friends first and chatted first. We were never? I knew him from work casually. We hooked up, then he started talking to me. I thought he was taking it slow out of respect, but he was always msging with the intent to bring sex into it. When he first brought it up he went “I'd been wanting to say that for ages!” Caught the first lie I guess...

Obviously it’s good to want to work on yourself and be single, but I don’t believe in “bad timing” cause wouldn’t the right person make you want to be with them? I thought finally maybe someone actually liked me for me. It's really fucking with my self worth now, like how come even though you seem to appreciate me and care and shit, I’m STILL not good enough? What is it about me? :(

It's making me think, he only came after me because he always knew that's all i was good for? Despite finding out more about each other all this time.

I’m upset I didn’t even get to see him in person before this ended. I’m fucking broken. Its not like I ever got to show who I even really am, it’s so hard through text.

Pushing the friends part hurts. How can I be friends with him if he’s eventually going to find a girl who WILL do it for him and make him want to commit?

So many of my ""comfort"" things involve those interests we had in common, but i can't do them because they remind me of him.

If he wants to be alone, hopefully NC it will actually force him to be alone. He can’t be getting the benefits of someone intimate to care for/caring for him.

This is my (M22) first time in a relationship (still a Virgin) with my gf (F22). She is my first love and my first relationship and it has been going for 3 months now. 

(We were friends for 6 months and then got into a relationship) 

She has had two boyfriends before me. She just got out of a 2 year relationship with her ex and quickly got into a relationship with me within a span of a week of her break-up. Sometimes I wonder how she could just transition from her ex to me. 

Note : we still haven't had sex, it's just really steamy make out and stuff

Usually when we are alone things get hot and steamy within 15 mins of being with each other and this made me wonder how she was with her ex. All the sexual intimate things they had with each other flooded my mind. 

When I kiss her the thought of her ex who kissed her same lips appear. The thought of her legs being spread open to another man and him doing whatever he wants grosses me out. I'm sure she used the same mouth to do stuff to him and these things  are really disturbing me right now. 

I confronted her about the issue going on with me and she instantly started crying and telling me she can't change her past. She fell in love with me because I never physically assault her while both of her ex beat her up. She says I always make her laugh and never once have I laid my hand on her when I get angry. 

But now whenever I think about kissing her a her ex pops into my head. 

Guys I know I am immature but this is my first relationship. When I think of my girl who I consider so precious and beautiful being used before by other men really messes my mind

He told me before we started dating he was seeing another woman he met and proceeded to ask me on a date and I ignored it (because we weren’t dating - so I figured no big deal). He also mentioned to me while we were dating that he saw another woman, but she stopped texting him - once again, I was stupid, ignored it, and proceeded to sleep with him. The last time we slept together (which was on that day he told me) he left retainers, and he told me about this so I kindly held it for him. He recently tried meet up with me just to “chill” and keep it “PG 13” and go about his business within the same hour. Furthermore, he wanted me to travel out my way (1+ hour) to give him his retainers. I told him later to meet me instead but he proceeded to say he was too busy due to a meeting important to him. He asked me to deliver it to a places for his convenience after I called him out after he rejected to pick up his stuff. I called him out on his past ghosting behaviors and told him I will not be traveling to deliver his retainers and he needed to pick up his stuff ASAP due to me realizing his rude ghosting behaviors (finally), he apologized and said he wants to check in and he’s taking my feedback. Thereafter, he suddenly started texting me how am I doing and how’s my day - something he did barely. I texted him to leave me alone and that I was tired of his disingenuous texts (he sends texts that are either related to sex, how was my day, or texts to ask for a date [which leads to sex].

Worth mentioning, he also attempted to manipulate/gaslight me by ghosting me and when I ghosted him back he asked me, “so who is ghosting who?” I’m leaning towards throwing his hat and retainers out or asking him once more to meet me instead and have travel out his way (1+ hour) to get his things.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the two dates that we had for what they were (drinks date 1, dinner date 2) and both ended with kissing. But for each date, the conversation in person felt weird, on the surface it's fine but (I can't really describe the feeling) it felt like a performance from her and also felt forced, she didn't ever come across 100% natural (or relaxed? I can't describe it)
