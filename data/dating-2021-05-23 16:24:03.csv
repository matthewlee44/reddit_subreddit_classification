0,njhowz,1621805077,I keep building fantasy versions of my crushes and I want to stop doing that,"So I noticed something where if I develop a crush on a girl, I'd unintionally start creating a fantasy counterpart which sets up an unrealistic standard that the real crush can never live up to. I develop crushes rarely, and when I do, I self sabotage it. I'm tired of doing this because it can become emotionally exhausting wanting to pursue a version of the girl that doesn't exist and it keeps killing my chances at actual romance or even developing a meaningful friendship with that person. I noticed I did this with my last crush who I assumed was: inexperienced (she had experience and severe anxiety from it), a late bloomer (mom was foxy af, but dad had a childish baby face that it turns out she takes after), wanting to jump into a relationship and love hard (her anxiety had her heart secured like a fortress and wanted to take things super slow), anyways you get the point. She could have at the very least been an awesome friend and I ruined all of that because of what I kept doing. Any advice to stop doing this? It isn't my first time and I've done this 3 other times (I'm almost 30 for reference).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/njhowz/i_keep_building_fantasy_versions_of_my_crushes/

I have ADHD (with a lot of co-morbid symptoms of autism) so noticing, registering, and processing social cues like body language just isn’t something I actively do. I have to be paying super closer attention to notice anything but then my brain is focused on what their body might be saying and not what their mouth is actually saying. I’m also then not paying attention to how I come off. So my filter breaks and my obviously mentally disabled side comes out which is not exactly a turn on.

(all happened in a week span) last night we barely talked. because he made a remark on a movie when a girl and a guy was on the screen getting sexual saying you wish that was you. i got annoyed and made it clear with my facial expressions. but ultimately let it go. and he kept asking what’s wrong. what’s wrong. and i kept saying nothing because it was a dumb comment i’m not gonna let it bother me. but the more he asked me what’s wrong the more i got annoyed. and i told him that. so we slept. he woke up left for work and came back. and got annoyed when i was listening to music out loud because he wanted to nap. but my airpods were dead and every night i have to hear him on the video game when i try to sleep. so why is it a problem and get mad and be pissy because i just wanna listen to music. but okay. i let it go. got up and showered. and we haven’t talked much after cause he’s playing his game. and i’m going home tonight. it’s just hard. i feel like i’m filled with so much sadness. and idk what’s happening. and i know when i go home we won’t talk. (we barely text when we’re not together. it never bothered me because when i’d see him we’d pick up right where we left off.) and we’re starting classes together in a week. and i just feel scared. idk why. i’m just scared of not knowing. and i can’t talk to him about it. because it’s always the same convo and it ends with me feeling just as shitty and i know he’s getting tired of my emotions. i just keep overthinking everything, i feel like i’m killing myself. i love him. but i’m in so much pain. i have my own insecurities and self esteem issues but i know he loves me and would never be disloyal to me. and he would never take advantage of me in any aspect. idk what the conclusion of this message is maybe i just need reassurance from him. but how.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/njibbu/rant/

Like when I brought them over to a party everyone asked if she was my gf and all that, and it was only a small hangout but it showed me how people just assume things.

I like to go out to clubs and bars to of course flirt and talk with girls and so I was just wondering if it’s going to be different compared to when I go out with my male friends, and as guys we know to step aside and let your friend do his thing. 

As a dude when I see a guy out with two or three girls by himself I kind of assume he’s gay or that he’s just good and comfortable with women. It depends on how he dresses snd acts but in my situation I just like there company and appreciate like them as people since they’re from different countries as well.

One is a neighbour we used to catch the same bus home after work. After a couple of months, I talked to him first and asked if he likes to grab a coffee sometime. I approached him because I found him checking me out a few times, which encouraged me to talk to him. It turns out he was married. Unfortunately I did not check out his hand...my bad. But he was friendly, he said :""I would love to, but I am married."" I was super embarrassed, I apologised and ran away. 

Few years later, I often run into this cute guy at train station after work. Also I found him looking at me a few times and look away quickly when I look back at him. My friend encouraged me to talk to him, they said he must be shy. But I am not so sure. One night, I was standing in the middle of the platform waiting for the train. He walked over to me and stood right next to me. Usually, he would walk to the end of the platform to wait for the train. But this time he stood next to me. I really thought he wanted to talk to me but he is just too shy to approach me. So finally the next day, I gave him a quick note with my number on it. He texted me and said ""Sorry, I've been seeing someone."" I am very annoyed at myself mis-interpreted all those signs. I just want to dig a hole in the ground and jump straight in. And I have been very upset over this. It happened last week. 

It reminds me of some guys' posts here saying that girls checking them out but after the guys approached them, girls either say they are not interested or they have a bf. I can understand how frustrated you are...

I've never really dated an i kinda need a few advice here.

Context: I started to be interested in a guy at school. After a while i start texting him and after a bit of fafing around i finally ask him out top get a coffee. He said YES ! After a bit of a hard time setting up a date, we meet yesterday. 

It was great, we took a walk around the city for 4 hours while talking. I was very nice. we both went form anxious to being way more relaxed. like i said very nice. At the end we talked about a common ( outside ) party next week. and he was like ''we can keep in touch to know if i go, and you can pop up too....... or not hahaha'' then i said how if he is there i'll be there too. 

when i got home i texted him about how the date was fun ! he also replied that it was fun.

now problem: i don't know how much to text him. i know as an adult i should not worry about who text who first but i still do. I don't wanna appear too eager and scrare him. Still i don't wanna text him too little to appear closed off. i just don't know ( i also don't wanna tell him that as to not appear too weird)

This was a span of 4 months. 21F When we first started talking and getting to know eachother, everything was fine and doing little simple dates that lasted a span of 3-4 hours at a time.. I (22M) found out that she still had contact with her ex (28M relationship span: 8 months) and before we were “talking” she wanted to see if that relationship would work first before getting into one with me. Our first time dating was going smooth until he texted her that he still “loved her” and wanted her back.. we broke up 2 days after that because she has a personal problem that was currently in her life.

She contacted me again 2 days later and said nothing happened with her ex and she wanted to be with me.. my first question was if she would cut ties with her ex, she said yes (wasn’t going to make her, just wanted to see where the commitment level was at, she said yes) since I’m a very forgiving person I accepted her back into my life and we went on a vacation and spent my birthday with her.. this was to a point that my relationship felt like it was just to the start of everything new. When we got back and she left my house, we broke up again because of the personal issue and said that she wanted time before we could get back together because of the (personal issue, and wanted a higher self confidence) before hopping into a relationship. Out of spite, I called it off. She has always said that I have been the most/best caring and supportive boyfriend she has had and that I she wanted a future

At this point I wasn’t planning on speaking to her again. But talked to a guy about that a friendship was possible if I didn’t look to her for only intimacy. So I contacted her again and she said “ok, but to respect her chance of trying to get back with her ex” she said it didn’t last long but she was at his apartment for one night to see if it would work. I told her I would wait to date if she wanted to be exclusive to each-other but without a title. However, each time we hangout she would always get a call or text from her ex and she would reply, this happened weekly. I always bought her flowers and did everything to support and make her issues go away. Which she said all of those issues were gone and that she was going to cut ties for our relationship

After we both started working 40hrs, I worked 2-10p and she would work 7a-8p. Messages were bland and hardly any effort was in it on her end, I understand because she worked long shifts. She was also about to go on a trip with her friends. I made her a letter for each day of her trip and planned to give it to her that Wednesday. So A week before, I scheduled a date because that would be the only time in a span of a month that we would see eachother because of the vaca and that we both had off and she agreed. 3 days out, she picked up another shift and said “sorry I work”. I saw she had Friday off and asked if she wanted to hangout then because I could take it off and she said “sorry I have plans”.. after my shift I drove to her apt, slept on the couch (didn’t talk to her in person because it was midnight and she works @ 8a). I Put the letters on her coffee table and left before she went to work and texted a long message giving an ultimatum but without a timeline I’m not going to “let her have a cake and eat it too” and that she needs to ditch the ex for good and if that’s the decision she makes and depending on how long that decision is, if I’m still single then we could talk but not to message back until she made a decision.

36,njm6cf,1621819082,how u say...healthy communication?,"a few weeks ago i (21F) went on a date w this guy (22M) i met on a dating app who i deeply connected with. we went on another date a few days later and it seemed there was significant potential there. however he lives an hour away &amp; works as a server full-time. i also work part-time &amp; go to school so the days we can see each other are very limited, its basically a LDR. 

i totally understand that not everyone is good at texting, even if i'm the opposite. so when his responses started to get shorter and less frequent i gave him the benefit of the doubt to the best of my ability. however i live w BPD (something i disclosed to him on our first date, its not easy to date someone w BPD. he was totally understanding, ""everyone comes with their own baggage"") and fear of abandonment is one of my most prevalent symptoms. not hearing from an SO for 12+ hours really hurts and just isn't sustainable for me. i don't want him to feel like he has to text me every 2 hours, but i do need some form of reliable daily communication. 

this led me to express over text that our current dynamic wasn't working for me &amp; that while i wasn't ready to call it off yet, i did want to have a conversation about each other's needs the next time we meet. basically after that, nothing changed, his response times got longer. i continued to deal w it bc obviously we haven't had that conversation yet. but i haven't heard from him since late Thursday night and i figured ok, i scared him away and this is him ghosting me. i cried all night friday &amp; saturday and even this morning, feeling stupid and naive for trusting someone again. i'm familiar w being discarded w no explanation but it by no means hurts any less each time. i was still sad about it today but i went about my day, told myself it wouldn't be easy but this too shall pass. then around 6pm he texted me ""hey i'm sorry i've been so busy the past couple of days"" and i have no idea what to say or if i should even say anything. i really really like this guy, don't get me wrong. its possible i'm idealizing him but honestly, at least in person, he's treated me nicer than any other guy i have been with and i really would like more of that. but i'm not okay with him going MIA for two days, i don't care how busy you are, if you don't have time to shoot me a quick text saying ""hey i'm really busy this weekend but i hope you're well!"" or some bullshit then maybe you can't handle being with me. i don't even feel like its just a ""me"" thing, i feel like anyone, regardless of BPD, deserves that type of decency. 

i guess my question is: how can i express that his absence was extremely upsetting to me in a non-accusatory manner that doesn't push him away further? i don't want to make it sound like ""i'm mad at you, you suck, these are all the reasons why""; my intention is not to make him feel bad, only to express my feelings. or should i just plan to see him again and wait till then to bring it up? please help, i genuinely have 0 experience with healthy relationship or healthy ways to resolve conflict with a SO",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/njm6cf/how_u_sayhealthy_communication/

“ Haha he just always talked about you. And the way he spent extra time with you I thought there was something going on at first lol. He would just say how he didn't know how or what he could do anymore to make you better but that he likes ending the day with you as his patient. But sometimes when me or another coworker would fuck around with him he would just blush and give that look. You know the one I'm talking about lol. We just always poked fun at him about how he would stay late with you and wait to finish treatment until we left . He would just blush and mumble whatever and we just moved on. With him it's 50/50 . I would joke with him that he had a crush on you but he's my boss so he's not going to be legit with me you know?

Seriously, was I wrong for thinking he was interested? He did tell me no for whatever reason. I wondered if he was interested but was not comfortable crossing that line.

54,njo3cp,1621825463,In the past month alone I have been ghosted by 4 different people that we actually had a lot of initial chemistry together. Seemingly over very minor things. Is this just the dating world now that everyone goes through or am I missing something?,"So full disclosure I’m completely single for the first time in my life (I’m 28). I’ve been openly and consensually non-monogamous pretty much that whole time so I’m no stranger to going on dates and flirting and all that. This is just the first time that expectations are different.

But that’s just preamble and this post is not about people’s opinions on the viability/non-viability of non-monogamy. It’s just a disclaimer that previously it was always very easy to know what the dating scene was gonna be because all my profiles were made with my ex’s so it was clear you were talking to both of us with clear expectations.

Anyway newly single and newly vaccinated I downloaded all the dating apps and started going to parties again. This past month alone thing would go really well then abruptly stop or turn cold with several people.

Girl 1: first person I match on bumble with post vaccination. Mention right on my profile I’m into BDSM and she says she is too. Immediately exchange numbers. We took like a BDSM quiz together turns out we’re into the same weird shit. We exchanging nudes and vids and she sexts me about all the things she wants to do to me. Then she asks if we can FaceTime for a bit and I’m like “oh ok sure”. We talk for an hour, she like makes a remark that my voice is much more feminine than she expected, which shouldn’t be a surprise cause I’m the epitome of a twink. Anyway that’s the last thing she says to me before completely ghosting me.

Girl 2: first actual date from bumble. Also both into kink non-monogamy stuff. Both are having a really fun night. End up bar hopping for like 7 hours before coming back to my place where we hooked up. And we were both switches so it was really hot and drawn out taking turns being the dominate one. Then it’s like 2 am and time to go to bed so I asks if she wants to cuddle and she’s like “sure” so we do and I pass out. Wake up next morning and she is like not saying two words to me. Leaves my place and ghosts me. My guess was that she was like an affection adverse person and she was freaked out at my interest in being cuddly? But she was also a very direct person so literally the whole night she would say exactly what she meant so idk why the second I asked to cuddle we go from laughing and joking to completely cold. I thought if she was that disinterested in it she would have just said so.

Girl 3: polyamorous girl who thought I was cute and funny in her words from the dating app. We get drinks and walk around the city. We make out and arrange a second date. She texts me the next day saying she thinks I’m a great kisser and can’t wait for our second date. Couple days before I ask where does she wanna go and she texts back “actually I’m not interested but good luck”

Girl 4: met at a party. We talk for hours. Turns out we’re both highly educated and cynical people. I didn’t want to feel like I was bothering her so when I would float around the party to meet other people she would often end up coming back up to me to talk some more. She mentions that she thinks I’m really funny and really likes my style. I love fashion and I used to stand up so this all makes sense. We exchange insta’s and she jokes that she’s gonna profile stalk which who doesn’t. Party ends and as I’m going to walk home she catches up to me, turns out we live close so she asks me to walk her home. She says how she had a really great time and would wanna do something again. I say how about Thursday and she says that works. She made the suggestion that I should come over to her placeThursday to watch Netflix together. I’m literally getting invited to Netflix and chill I don’t know how much more clear that could be. I head home and DM her my phone number. Messages me in the morning that she’s actually busy Wednesday. I know where this is heading. I ask if she wants to meet up anytime at all and she’s like “no, I’m not interested in you at all and I don’t know where you got that idea from.” I’ve never been invited to Netflix and chill by sometime completely uninterested before. My guess is there was something in my profile she didn’t like but I don’t know for sure.

My story in a few lines:
- 35 yrs old, male
- work in banking in NY and make good money
- But dating life has been miserable to say the least
- I am a kind hearted person who looks for an emotional connection before the physical one
- Struggling to find a decent person in NY
- A month back I connected with someone in Toronto, Canada
- A successful woman with an inclination toward fitness- my type
- She loves NY and is happy to move here in case things work out
- We had a few great calls. Loads of laughter and a good connection. But as the border is closed, it became difficult to continue without meeting in person
- Had a candid discussion- decided that we would wait for the border to reopen and meet in person; calls are not much helpful without any face time
- I always felt she was interested but of course, I have doubts just like any human would
- She still wanted to have calls at a decided frequency but I suggested just waiting for the border to open
-  After the last call ended, she sent this message within 5 minutes:

“Hey,

I just wanted to say it’s been really nice connecting these past few weeks and that I’m appreciative of all the initiatives you’ve taken. It’s not everyday I meet a man like you 😊

But I trust that the best will work out for both of us. 

Take care”

Question: Is she worth pursuing? Is she genuinely interested in me? She didn’t take much initiative but was very responsive and always sent long texts with a lot of smileys. We had long calls too. I felt she was reciprocating my efforts with enthusiasm.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated? I agree it would be better to date someone locally in NY. But now I am open to options even in the vicinity given the current stage of my life.

I recently met many of his family members, and he's at my place for the next few weeks so I'm slowly introducing him to mine for the first time. Things have been very awesome between us and the only inkling of something off I can imagine is that he constantly says he worries that he will screw things up b/c he's forgetful, or messy, etc. I've snooped once in his journal and every entry about me is how much he loves me, wants to marry me, wants me to move in with him, etc. but in a few he says he's worried about losing me. TODAY I snooped through text messages that were on his laptop and saw several convos with girls that it appears he's met on Hinge since his move to LA that are VERY flirtatious. I found this out right before we left to lunch with my cousin and his fiance and I had to pretend the entire time that all was normal but I could tell he sensed something was off.

I'm fit and workout daily, attractive black guy, love to go hiking/camping, travel and do fun things; but alas that's never translated into meeting someone.

For the last 3 years I've tried dating apps and those never worked out for me. I used a date coach and had my profile checked out and they always said it was one of the best but I garnered little to no interest from attractive women. If I did get a like they were usually from very unattractive/overweight women and that’s just not for me. Like everyone else, I do have a type but don’t consider myself picky, I just know what I want; which is someone kind, has a sense of humor and athletic. I know the pandemic made it hard to meet people in person too but even now when it's starting to go back to normal I still can't meet someone. When others give me advice they say join groups or meet through friends except the problem there is I have no friends. My last two remaining acquaintances from school are both married and have kids and never hangout. Most of my days are spent alone and I do everything by myself whether it's go out for dinner or hiking or just cruising around the town or visiting parks. I used to love being alone and I cherished those times but now it's tiresome, I want to know what it's like on the other side too; The side of having someone spontaneously call me up on a Friday night asking to come chill, the side of having a woman by myself to support one another and spend time with.

I feel as if my luck has just been awful, I feel completely invisible. Everywhere I go are couples having a good time, people out on dates and friends always having someone to hangout with on weekends etc. The last time I tried to ask someone to hangout with me I had to beg or they just cancel and I refuse to be that guy anymore. In all fairness though something I have struggled with for a long time is the feeling of being left out, that feeling of never being on anyone's mind or know what it's like to be wanted. Granted I started trying to date later in life but never in my wildest dreams did I ever assume it would be this hard.

I know I'm worthy of love, affection and friendships but I'm just lost and don't know where to start...I guess. How do I make friends this late in life where most have them carry over from school or work? How do I meet a woman who's interested in wanting to get to know me and possibly build towards something? Honestly, it feels as though I'm starting life from scratch. I’ve worked my ass off to become a desirable person such as losing weight and now being very fit and hit the gym 5 times a week, have my own apartment, nice car, stable job etc. I reek of personality and always get compliments on my smile but again…women don’t stick around...or rather show interest in the first place.

64,njomuc,1621827388,Is it okay to never bring up ex partners?,"I'm (mid 20s F, straight) the kind of person who hates talking about my exes, not because I have anything to hide or any skeletons in my closet—they were all lovely people that I think the world of but we just didn't work out romantically—but because if I'm dating you I want to be in the here-and-now with you, and not dwelling on, or comparing you with, any former partner(s). 

Most guys take this well and hate hearing about a woman's exes anyway, but I did once go out with a guy (for a couple months) who would keep bringing up the topic of my past boyfriends, and even when I explained that I'd rather let the past be water under the bridge and try to move on/focus on our current relationship instead, he would keep working in ways to ask about my previous partners. Most questions were innocent/non-sexual, like where I met my exes, what their backgrounds were, how I feel like they meshed with me, etc., but it still really rubbed me in an odd way that he was so persistent about wanting to know details about my past partners.

So my question is: do you think this guy was just an anomaly in the dating world (he's maybe just a nosey guy), or do you think it's only natural that two people in a relationship will end up talking about their exes after a couple months of going out?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/njomuc/is_it_okay_to_never_bring_up_ex_partners/

I don’t think about a girlfriend 24/7 but it bothers me sometimes. It’s like no one is literally attracted to me. Every time I talk to a girl it’s literally super dry and the conversation is little to none. I have 3 dating apps rarely get any likes so that’s fine I guess.

I’m not interested in settling down until like my mid 30s at the earliest and it would probably take me a full 5 years of a relationship to commit to a marriage or kids. 

As time has crept on, my options are becoming dating younger (immature) women, which I have no interest in…. Or single moms, which can’t keep up with my lifestyle. Or girls that want me to move them in and knock them up. The only women not actively looking to settle down is because their life is a complete shit show, and they couldn’t even imagine adding the complexity of a child to their current disaster. I’m honestly just looking for someone self sufficient and can afford/have time to travel.

My plan was to not get married or have kids until my second half of my 30s. I’ve done some intelligence gathering from old dudes and they suggested that you can’t find women to marry without baggage when you’re that age. 

I wonder if this is exclusive to their gen x experience?

78,njpk96,1621830717,"First Time Asking Someone Out, Maybe?","So, I'm 25/F, never been in a relationship or even on a real date explicitly intended as a date. I have very little self confidence and I'm very nervous about being perceived as disgusting/stupid, or just about being rejected in general.

 STRAP IN BECAUSE THIS WILL BE LONG.

 Last August I decided to visit the town I grew up in to walk my dog on a trail I don't normally take. While there, I recognized someone walking towards us- a friend from highschool I used to have a bit of a crush on. I would normally have walked by, but I waved! I said hi! We stopped and chatted; turns out he went to school to study something I'm very interested in and we struck up a conversation about it, keeping it brief. Total coincidence we were both there as NEITHER of us would walk this trail under normal circumstances.
 I contemplated for a couple hours when I got home and ended up messaging to ask if he'd like to go for a hike (one of many mutual interests). I felt absolutely sick, thinking he would think I was weird and kinda gross based on whatever he remembered of me from HS (I was doughy and had acne, etc). He agreed, though, and we made plans to meet!

 Through the course of the summer we went kayaking, hiking, and eventually on an overnight backpacking trip and dinner with his parents when we came home. I had so much fun! I like to think he did, too, considering he kept agreeing to come hang out. He let me drive when we went out, took photos into birds nests and mushrooms I couldn't reach (he's tall, I am NOT), and when we were backpacking, he would get my water out of my pack for me so I didn't have to unbuckle and take my pack off. Compliments in return for self-deprecating statements, etc. Literally a blessing.

 It was so much fun to reconnect and so very natural. We hadn't spoken since graduating six years ago. We talked about dating but never about US dating, and everything from expectations from life to insecurities and all the good stuff. Extremely important for me especially was that he felt safe. I've had some bad experiences and I'm anxious . I struggle to even order food from men out of fear of being judged, but I never clammed up or panicked with him around, and I only feel a regular amount of insecure. 
 
Through the summer we even made plans for the coming year to tackle some more challenging trails or head out places we haven't been yet, but between his seasonal (winter) employment, a surge in covid cases in the area, and neither of us really being social media people, we only chatted a little between our last walk in November and now (May). 
 
  I finally messaged him again after our last conversation fizzled out and I thought it was dead, and a week later, he finally messaged BACK, agreeing to go out. Now we just have to settle on a date... When he eventually messages back!
 
 Our conversations in person are literally fantastic and he's extremely intelligent, engaging, and patient. I always have a blast and we can talk about anything. When I get home I always feel a little high and disappointed that I can't just come out and ask him if he'd like to have an actual date, or if what we've done could be considered dating. I can work it all out in my head and script it from start to finish when he's NOT around but as soon as it's practical, everything ounce of composure and confidence leaves me. We are both shy and I can't tell if he's a) missing the signals b) I'm not signaling strong enough c) he's just not interested. 

 I know no one is going to be able to tell if he's interested in me or not from a one sided text post, and honestly I'm perfectly fine being friends with him- I'd just like to puzzle it out. What signs should I look for? Any major red flags that are going to scream 'you'll be rejected'?

88,njqcxo,1621833667,Guy always “sends the last message” and never texts first,"Decided to get some advice from anyone out there. I’ve recently gotten back into the dating scene and for starters, it seems I can only ever date people who I’ve become friends with first.

So there’s this new guy, we met last year through a friend and I’ve taken quite a liking to him because he seems to be the nicest one in my friend group at the moment. He’s kind, polite and caring and we both have been out on a few outings/dinners together in this group of friends. Sometimes he will sit next to me and sometimes when I ask him to come and sit with me, he’ll say no at first but then still come and sit next to me later which I think is quite cute. To me he seems to be quite the introvert, the guy who listens more than he talks.

Anyway, fast forward to March/April this year when I first started messaging him and surprisingly he messaged me back as well. We talked on and off whenever we were free and it felt really nice to share about a lot of different topics and get to know him better. 

But here’s the funny part, amongst my group of friends (mostly girl friends and a handful of guy friends) I am usually the one to “send the last message” more often than not and be left on read or whatever, which let me get straight I don’t mind/care. With him though, he seems to find a way to reply to every message (even when imo, there isn’t a need for a reply) such that he’s the one to “send the last message” and it basically comes down to me to start another conversation whenever I feel like it, which is strange for me.

Looking back in our text messages when we do talk it seems to be in equal turns so, again, it seems quite alright. And me being me, I took the opportunity to ask him out to dinner, which he agreed to. It was in all honesty pretty chill and we even went to get some drinks after dinner so that’s definitely a plus. We said our goodbyes and did the I had a nice time messages and said we’d go out again some time soon. 

It took a couple of days and when he didn’t seem to say anything about the next outing. I decided to try my luck and ask him out again. He said yes again and we did some planning together over texts and then just like that the conversation died down naturally.

Now for context I didn’t exactly specify that it’s a date per se, so therein lies the problem itself I suppose. It’s just less pressure when it’s an outing and not a date IMO. I am considering making it clear to him when we next go out that it isn’t just an outing. But like any individual am fearful of the outcome. Any advice or am I reading into things too much?

Tldr: girl meets guy, waits 6 months to ask him out, guy says yes to a first and a second outing/dinner but never texts first in between?

89,njqjwg,1621834430,Cold approaching at the mall,"tl;dr : I cold approached 13 women at a mall and 1 woman at Petco. Managed to get only one phone number from those 14. I plan on texting her in the morning, question is: how soon should I set up a coffee date/hangout? ALSO: I recommend cold approaching to everyone reading. 

Yesterday morning, a post on r/seduction caught my eye, this post illustrated how a dude was cold approaching 5-10 women on the mall. The comments were full with motivating comments saying how confident the dude was for doing so. 

This post motivated me yesterday to go to the mall and practice my cold approaching skills. Basically become immune to rejection and gain confidence in myself. 

Well, yesterday (5-23-21) I (21M) went to the mall to accomplish two goals: 
First: buy some pants and 
Second: cold approach at least 5 women. 

Anddddd I accomplished both of those goals! As I was walking around the mall, I found many women whom I found attractive. I was able to cold approach a total of 13 women at the mall and another one at a Petco outside of the mall! All from the Latin background, since I’m a Latino interested in Latinas lol. 

Lamentably, only 1 of those 14 women were interested/available to actually give me her number. BUT, I see this as a WIN! I was actually able to muster confidence and directly approach these women.

The first 4 cold approaches were awful haha, but as I continued, I saw myself getting better at what to say and how to be more confident and indifferent over rejection. I got to the point where I didn’t even care about rejection! cuz I was actually getting more confident. I was also making their day since I was complimenting them, so that’s also a plus haha :) 

“Hey, I think you seem pretty cute, would you like to get to know each other via some coffee?”

^This was the line I ended up using the most. 8 of the women ended up having a boyfriend and the remaining 5 women simply weren’t interested. On all encounters, I did my best to give off this positive, friendly vibe at all times. So after being rejected, I would say something along the lines of:

“Hey no worries, I hope the best for both you and your boyfriend, have a nice day :)”

Ultimately, I recommend everyone to try some cold approaches, I super recommend this over online dating. But that’s just my opinion, cuz my experience with OLD has not been the best lol

Lastly, on the one girl (18F) that did give me her number. How quickly should I set up a date/hangout? I plan on shooting her a text in the morning, something like:

“Hey name, this is name from memorial mall from yesterday haha. How are you doing?”

92,njqvb1,1621835759,Some guys make things so weird when it comes to paying,"Here are some things I experienced that I thought were so cringe. As a girl, I don’t expect a guy to pay for me. However the same should go for the guy and he should pay for himself instead of expecting or asking the girl to pay for him.  

1) Made a comment on the first date how he waits to see if the girl will pay for herself, as a test. And how it’s a turn off if she doesn’t. Like okay why are you telling me this... Just pay for yourself and go why make a big deal out of it. Also I’m not sure if he realizes but lots of girls will use the same test. 

2) Dropped all these hints that we should split the bill, in front of the waitress. Or stayed silent and drank water. Just say you want separate bills instead of waiting for me to say it. It’s not a big deal but not saying anything just makes things awkward. 

3) Waiting for me to go first at a coffee shop so that I would pay for myself. I don’t know if they’re done deciding what to order so I ask if they’re ready. And they’re like hmm not yet. So I’m waiting because I thought it would be rude to go first. After a while I realized he just didn’t want to go first and possibly upset me by not paying for me. So I went and paid for myself. 

4) This was the worst one imo. I told him this weekend wasn’t good for a date because I wouldn’t be able to drive and asked if he wanted to meet up next weekend. He insisted on this weekend and then told me that because he was driving that I should pay for him. The gas would’ve been like $2  and he wanted me to treat him on the first date. Who even asks someone else to pay for them? Also, I would hope that the guy I date wants to make an effort to see me and isn’t worried about spending $2 on gas. 

5) He bought something for himself at a store and asked me if I had any loose change. He had a card on him and wasn’t paying with cash. And we had just started seeing each other. Why should I give him money to pay for something he’s buying for himself? If we were shopping and I was buying something I wouldn’t ask him for money. 

6) Said “you’re not hungry are you? It’s too early for dinner” I knew he just didn’t want to pay for dinner so he wanted to avoid the situation altogether. I say this because I knew what he was like. Why bother asking me if you’re not planning on eating in the first place. 

7) Said he would take me to this store I really liked. Before we went he was all talk and acted like he was going to buy me something. And I didn’t ask for anything because I didn’t want to ask him to spend money on me. And when we got there he made no mention of his previous promises. Not buying me stuff is not a big deal but empty promises show that he’s unreliable and just all talk.  

I know that girls will often expect guys to pay too and it’s a turnoff. But these were just some things that really annoyed me. I always offer to pay for myself and I don’t get why guys have to be so suspicious about it. It’s just annoying. If you don’t want to pay, just ask for separate bills. Long periods of silence is worse.

93,njqvhn,1621835780,What are some date experiences that completely turned you off?,"I've been chatting with someone I met of the apps for the past 2 weeks. He seemed fun and enthusiastic and I was genuinely excited to meet him.

However, in person he was such a turn off. We agreed to drinks (and drinks only), but he insisted on grabbing food, so we decided to grab lunch together. He complained about the menu and then as we continued talking he kept complaining about being single (while on a date...). He said that he had yet to find a career he's passionate about ( which is 100% ok), but kept trying to one up me for every single success and goal I wanted to share.

I have no words. My online dating experiences as of late has turned me off from dating",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/njqvhn/what_are_some_date_experiences_that_completely/

Most of the posts here assume you actually meet and interact with potential partners regularly, meanwhile I haven't talked to a girl in 4 months, it seems like they don't exist irl

I'm turning 19 this September, I'm out of school, my work for the last 4 months has been all male, last time I talked to a girl was in my old food service job

Tried online dating, only girl I talked to in 6 months was 100 miles a way over the equivalent of the English channel

What sort of assumptions do you make about that?
Is it a turn off that they don't drink?
Do you assume problem related first?


I've never been a drinker. Its just something that has never appealed to me. I have no issue with it, all my friends drink and I hang out with them at bars and while they drink hanging out or on vacations/trips. Its really never been a big deal to me. The longer I play the dating app game though the more I notice that non-drinking adults seems to be 2% of the populace. Nearly every woman's profile I come across has at least one picture of them drinking wine/beer/liquor or at a winery.

I always feel the little bias pop in too when I see those pictures to swipe left or pass on the profile because I'm not looking for the ""party girl"". I have to stop myself and realize that's not fair, a picture is not a personality. So I'm a little curious how many matches do I lose from the inverse bias? Man or woman, what do you think if you come across someone's profile and they don't drink?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/njr329/no_drinking_games/

I just get so wrapped up in the fear that if not now than never. I just want to be a father so badly and I also just get insecure that,, that may never happen. I'm honestly on here because I am home from college and I sit in my house all day and do absolutely nothing and it's killing me because I'm trying not to spend money but I want to hang out with other people and do spontaneous things but I don't really have friends either so it just makes me more sad and lonely.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/njr4g2/im_having_trouble_finding_anyone/

Basically rinse and repeat ever since my last relationship messed me up pretty bad ( Wasted those 6 years trying to get her back to find out she only sees me as a friend now, Depression hit, weight gain, etc). Time wasted and no luck, i just gave up.. And when i did i think i gave up on love as well... I just got back from camping and while hanging with my 2 best friends around a campfire, talking about life and asking advice, one of my friends bring up that hes having issues at home with his signficant other. I simply do what any best friend would do and gave him my best advice even if im not really qualified to do so, thus giving him more positive energy to take into his relationship. While sitting and staring off into the fire, i realized that i dont even take my own advice..... I want to be happy but i dont even know how to approach a woman after years of being stuck to one. Fear of rejection due to my weight gain and looks shouldnt be a factor but it just gets to me. Im 23m and want to find a girl that i can laugh and have good time with, someone i can wake up to in the morning wearing my shirt. The litte things... But i cant even go out of my way to talk to a girl or even let alone ask one out. Im terrified of being alone...",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/njr8mr/dont_know_what_to_do/

99,njrf13,1621838037,Separated man I’ve been dating for 5 months said he needed time and a break,"Guys: 

I was dating a recently separated man for 5 months. He showed me in every way that he cared and loved me and made reference to future plans (marriage kids travelling etc). 

Then something triggered inside him when he saw his ex three times in the matter of within a week and then he became very wish washy with me and I probed at him and he eventually revealed he is struggling and lost and needs space and time and he’s not sure etc. (he’ doing a big move soon from country to coastal) 
2 days later we officially broke up and he sent me a very long msg saying all he said and meant was true during the relationship but he needs to face these trials alone otherwise he will bring everyone down that he’s in contact with and said once things settle down a little he would like to meet somewhere to talk things over.

What does he mean to talk things over?


This was the text message he sent after I said good luck and goodbye- 


The last 5 months have been nothing short of incredible. I truly believe god bought you into my life and you have effected me in such a positive way, I have never been cared for or nurtured like that except maybe at times by my mother. You are such a beautiful and precious soul and I’ve always said it and ill stand by it, you are a 1 in a million!!! 
I know it may be hard to hear at first, but Ashley my feelings for you have always come directly from my heart. I know this path is not following the way we dreamt things would go, but regardless what path we take or what the outcome is, I meant it when I said that I love you! You’ve been at the forefront of my mind and my emotions and theres barely been a day we haven’t spoken in the last 5 months. There’s been moments with you that I would say is the happiest I’ve ever been! You are just so pure and my intentions with you were all the same! I hold you in such high regard, you are so worthy of loyalty and respect. 

When we got together all those months ago I remember thinking how did I get so lucky, how can someone accept me with all my mess and trauma. All my ideals about relationship and partnership had been shattered and I was doing my best to pull it all together thinking that I don’t want to miss out on this rare gem that I couldn’t believe existed and was keen on me. At the time I didn’t realise, but looking back I unintentionally created a place in my mind that I jammed all my deepest hurts and didn’t allow myself to keep chipping away at it all.

I think there were times I knew I was struggling but I was avoidant in fear of tearing open the wounds again. After going to the show last weekend and in a matter of 2 days having 3 stressful encounters + the river one the week before, it was all just too much and it ruptured something inside of me.. I went to church Sunday morning in search of some respite and ended up in tears down the front after the service and had old mate ben praying for my healing. I knew right there, but again tried to fight it. I need to overcome these trials in my life, and I need to do it alone. Its not fair that anyone should have to carry the weight of my trauma. I know I said that I wanted to be a team and that we can overcome things together, and believe me I meant all of those things! But as life goes on we learn, grow and change. I know that if I don’t confront myself in this part of my life ill drag this mess with me and anyone that I’m in contact with for years to come. I can’t and I won’t do that to you, I value you too much! 

It completely breaks my heart to imagine how your feeling right now.. I’ve seen you continually open up to me, put your trust in me and be in a vulnerable state so many times. I hope that beneath the hurt you can see that I’ve been so gentle with you and I’ve done my best to cherish and treat you as good as I possibly can! The memories we have made I hold so dear, from you (falling) into the water trying to kiss me of the jetski, chocolate spiders, sunsets with the puppies to our snuggles in love nest. I appreciate every bit of joy you have brought into my life and if this is where it ends I will not look on this with a negative eye. This has been one of the most beautiful encounters a man could ever ask for!

I promise to give you whatever time or space you need ash.. and I will totally respect if this doesn’t sit right with you. But once things settle down a little I would like to meet somewhere to talk things over. I will continue to pray for you and for your future. I hope you can forgive me for what has happened and know that I will always care for you! 

Hopefully we can talk soon 
All my love
