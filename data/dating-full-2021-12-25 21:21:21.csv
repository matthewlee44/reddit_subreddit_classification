I live in the Netherlands, and he lives in Germany, so we're rather close, but not nearly as close as we could be. We have never met in person. Just for some additional information, we are both very good-looking and accomplished people. We had been following one other on social media for about a year when I eventually responded to his direct message and we began chatting. I've been really enjoying our discussion; we get along well so far, he is funny, and asks me meaningful questions, he hasn't said anything strange, he appears to be ideal on paper, and there has been a lot of flirting. I had already begun to like him and he is definitely boyfriend material. No red flags so far. At the beginning of this week, he seemed to really enjoy our conversation and so he asked if he could call me to hear my voice. I thought that was a great idea since it would allow me to get to know him better, see if there is a connection, and ultimately bring us closer together. As a result, we scheduled our first phone call for today. Prior to the call we were texting and he was replying instantly and I could tell he really likes me and was excited to get on a call.

As a result, he video calls me, but I decline and call him back using a regular call because I am not yet comfortable with video calls. The talk flowed despite the fact that I was asking most of the questions without giving him chance to ask me something (I was scared), and so I sort of dominated the dialogues, but my responses were extremely fascinating, we made jokes, laughed, and then he asked me about the video call again telling me he wanted to see me, I told him ""I'm not in the mood to do a video call right now, I thought we were just doing a call for today"" he replied ""hahaha okay okay no problem"" so he seemed very understanding. My plan was to make the phone call short and sweet leaving him wanting more. Therefore, after 30 minutes I said ""my aunt is calling me, I need to pick this up as she probably wants to wish me a Merry Christmas, but it was absolutely love speaking to you and we can chat later. I hope you have a good day"". He said: okay, you too have a good day.

I also told him I had plans later on with my family to cook and spend time with them and he was also with his family and grandparents. But he could have still sent me a sweet text as he was texting me early in the morning a lot while he was lunching with his grandparents and parents before we got on a call.

It's been 7 hours and he still hasn't replied to me which I find rather odd. I thought that maybe he would text me something later but nothing. I'm getting worried that maybe I did something wrong and he lost interest. Now I feel like I'll never hear from him again. What do you guys think? Am I overthinking? Maybe he is giving me the space to enjoy Christmas? Maybe we already spoke so what's the point in talking more today? I'm very upset as I really thought we were getting along well.

On the third hang out hugged, paid for the food. Called me pretty.

Tricky part, on the second day of talking we were just chatting about food and he tells me his life‚Äôs a bit complicated right now as him and his ex split but he‚Äôs staying over here at her parents place while they fix up the house to sell it so they can move on.

Things were of to a great start. We were supposed to be FWB, but it escalated quickly because we matched on a lot of stuff. 

For a bit of background she is a mother of 2 kids, 3 and 8. She's been struggling mentally (depression) and physically (injuries). 

I myself am in a really good place now, and was happy even before meeting her. Sport/Work/Hobby/Friends, I'm in a really healthy routine, and I can project myself in the future and am building something out of my life. 

So pretty naturally I stepped up to help her on cleaning, tidying, cooking and other chores. Plus, even if I don't have kids on my own, I have a really good feeling with them in general and her kids love me,  I spend time with them and give them a lot of attention and am really playful. It's really a second nature to me. 

But I don't like to hide my feelings and I'm done playing games. I want to keep my healthy lifestyle/vibe I have going on, so I'm honest in my relationships. 

So I told her I started to caught feelings. 

And since then, something broke. 

We are about to have a conversation about our relationship. She told me things are going too fast for her, but she doesn't want me to disappear.

As soon as I met him, I felt a huge connection that I haven't experienced in years honestly. We sat and talked in the coffee shop for 4 hours before he had to leave. That same night, he asked me to hang out again. Every day after that, we hung out together in pretty much all of our free time and clicked on a level that Ive never really experienced. It felt so perfect. We just had so much in common and he told me something seems different about me and he was really sad to leave. We shared a lot of intimate moments, but he told me he wanted to wait to have sex until the next time he sees me(not sure when that will be). That kind of surprised me considering how we met(Tinder) and our circumstances. He just left today and I'm feeling extremely sad. I don't know when I will see him again, if ever. We both expressed our strong feelings/crushes for each other after spending the entire week together, but he lives 2,000 miles across the country.

https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rnekla/redflags/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Was just checking in with him and I was asking how his Christmas was going and he told me he was at home eating dinner alone lol Which is a little strange to me, hear me out: he told me he had plans last night for Christmas Eve with his parents who flew into town a few days ago to visit so I figured he was hanging out with them today as well, so I was surprised when he just told me a little while ago when I texted him that he was at home ‚Äúeating pizza and drinking some wine‚Äù alone (well with his dog to be more exact). I asked him where his parents went and he told me they were visiting with other family in town (his moms sister/his aunt and his cousins and their families). I asked him why he wasnt there with his parents enjoying the Holiday with his cousins and the rest of the family and he told me, ‚ÄúIm not really close to them anymore‚Äù. So I asked him why and he said ‚ÄúWe used to be when we were younger/kids, but just life I guess, just grew apart. Dont really have that much in common with them anymore, they‚Äôre all married and have kids and in another point in their lives. And we dont really keep in touch that much anymore to be honest or have any kind of a relationship really, so I really dont see the point. I don‚Äôt mind it, I had a good dinner with my folks last night, so that was nice.‚Äù So I asked him ‚Äúbut your parents still have a good relationship with them and maintain contact?‚Äù and he said ‚Äúyeah, thats why they‚Äôre over there‚Äù. I also asked him about presents and he told me he didnt get anything lol because they didnt really do the presents thing since he was a kid.

Anyways, is this a redflag? Just think it‚Äôs a little weird he‚Äôd rather be on his own on Christmas rather than with the the rest of his family (even though he did have dinner with his parents last night). And it‚Äôs Idk it seems sad and lonely to me even though he says its perfectly fine to him.

I was thinking about inviting him over to my parents place where we‚Äôre having leftovers and chatting and having a good time with my siblings and their families (because I kind of feel sorry for him) but I think it‚Äôs too soon (because I havent introduced him to my family).

I know the guy is a bit of a loner or independent and an only child, but idk seems a little strange to me. he‚Äôs great and I like him a lot but sometimes I feel like hes a bit like Batman (he doesnt have a butler though lol), but yeah just too comfortable being lonely and distant from most people, I suppose.

I'm not really that type of person but it's part of the reason I broke up with my ex because it was getting serious to the point where I didn't think I would ever get the opportunity to do those things before the cliche ""settling down"" (sorry for all the air quotes).

I (F26) Met guy(M26) about 3 months ago the beginning he was perfect. Pursuing me hard core. If anything he was moving a little fast; he was mentioning me meeting his family in the first week. He lets me stay at his house and sleep in even when he is at work, he has offered to give me money if I‚Äôm running low, I‚Äôve met all his friends, met his boss etc. So a lot a ‚Äúcouple‚Äù type things. 
I was surprised when in week two I brought up exclusivity and he hit me with the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready for a relationship‚Äù thing. I was OK with it because I realize that we‚Äôve only known each other for two weeks. He also went on to talk about how he just got out of a relationship that lasted a year 5 months ago. I told him it takes me a while to decide on a relationship and I also got out of a relationship recently. 
So he continues pursuing me after that conversation but then I noticed he would do this thing where he would invite me to come spend the night with him but then last minute cancel because he was too tired. But then randomly he will contact me to go on these very ‚Äúcouple-like‚Äù dates. For example I went to meet his boss one evening. Then we go another few weeks of him being flakey with meeting up and then he invites me to come to dinner to meet his parents. 
So after I meet his parents I try to make plans with him the following weekend and he basically wouldn‚Äôt hold down any committed plans. But then last minute on a Friday night I run into him at a pub and he ends up taking me out to this super nice restaurant where we have a super romantic evening and he probably spent over $200 on me. It was nice but just out of nowhere. 

Then where the drama starts is the following week I try to make plans with him again and he basically did the same thing where he wouldn‚Äôt commit to a plan. I was upset with him and told him that I would like a little more time with him and he replies that he ‚Äúisn‚Äôt ready for a relationship‚Äù I tell him that I am not asking for a relationship I would just like to spend more time together. Then a week later I ran into him at a party. The whole time we are getting along great and he is introducing me to a lot of his friends and then towards the end of the party I get really drunk and clingy. When I could tell he was getting annoyed with me I told him that I don‚Äôt wanna relationship and that we are both free to hang out with whoever we want and that I am going on dates with other guys myself and this whole time I‚Äôve been seeing other guys. That is definitely not true and I don‚Äôt know why  said that.
The next morning I apologize to him and told him that we are both free to hang out with whoever we want but that he is the only guy  I‚Äôve been hooking up with. He said it was OK. I tried to be casual and fun again and asked if he wanted to meet up with some friends of mine and he declined. I know he just started a new job so he‚Äôs busy with that but I would‚Äôve thought he would‚Äôve reached out to me by now as I haven‚Äôt heard from him in a week which is the longest we have gone.

Hi,

I met a girl about 2 months ago who is a really a nice person! However, I have a feeling that I am being used as a rebound and I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about her past.

She broke up with her bf earlier this year (January) and she was with him for 4 years. A few months later (May) she meets another guy who she had a summer fling with. She claimed it was fun but she would have never gotten with him. They are no longer together.

Fast forward to October, she meets me. Currently we‚Äôre friends but she has been wanting to meet me for a while now. She wanted to go out with me which we plan to do but I can‚Äôt help but think that I‚Äôm a rebound. She initiates almost everything which i find very odd since I‚Äôm not used to that.

The way I see it is that she had a LTR for 4 years and found another guy 4 months later and stayed with him in the summer. Shes created memories with two other guys who she loved/ liked where as I have never had that ever. Now that they aren‚Äôt together, I think that I am ‚Äúnext.‚Äù",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1140709,public,self,(19m) can‚Äôt stop thinking about her past,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/roms4h/19m_cant_stop_thinking_about_her_past/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,

Who does this? I didn't ask further but he said he has no interest in dating her again. Okay.

I continued to age with the opinion that I actually wanted to remain independent and single going forward.

Shorty after college I finally found myself in my first relationship after a female co-worker began making moves. The feeling was obviously mutual at the time but I ended it bcuz she traveled way too much. 

Anyways, now Im really kicking my self bcuz i've got a really really strong desire for a connection/relationship with someone im crazy about that I never fully established the first time.

We‚Äôve spent the last week building furniture and we live about 2.5 hours away at the moment.

The only thing left to build is the wardrobe. She‚Äôs planning on coming up to the flat with her parents on Tuesday, to bring her stuff up and her dad is going to help build the wardrobe.

Our parents haven‚Äôt seen the flat yet, so I was planning to bring my parents up there on Monday, and she‚Äôs planning to bring hers up on Tuesday.

I suggested the idea to my parents today that they should stay over a night when they come on Monday just to experience it. Because the place where we are staying at now, is old compared to our new flat which is very modern. Just thought it would be nice for my parents to experience it for a day before we move in.

We currently have a sofa bed and I said I‚Äôd have to bring something to sleep on.

I told my GF my idea today, she didn‚Äôt like it at all. Said she wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable having my parents sleep on our sofa bed, when the bed hasn‚Äôt arrived yet as we‚Äôd still be sleeping on it.

Then I said I can tell my parents to bring duvets etc to sleep on if she didn‚Äôt want them sleeping on our sofa bed. Then she said they have no reason to stay.

I felt a bit hurt by this, felt she‚Äôs rejecting them or have no respect for them.

Am I thinking or seeing it wrong? Or is she right?

The majority of the begining of the relationship was long distance but we ended up living together for about the last year before i had to move out of the country (for work). We ended up having a lot of problems once we started living together. We weren't like we were before, and it wqs mostly my fault. I suffer from fairly severe depression and went through a really bad spot for a long time. I wasnt attentive. I was very distant and didnt put in nearly the effort i should have and ended up pushing her away. To make things worse, 2 days before i moved away i found out that she had been having a romantic relationship with someone else. Not physical as far as she says, and i believe her. I decided to not leave because i truely felt guilty. I felt i pushed her to this. Despite everything, she said she still wants to make things work. Fast forward to today. Ive been out of country for about a month. She hardly talks to me anymore, shes actively messaging other people while ignoring my messages, leaving me on read, etc. And the only times she does try to talk to me it always ends with her needing me to do something for her. Send money etc. Im beginig to think the only reason she wanted to stay together was to be taken care of financially. Ive made efforts to change (maybe too little too late) and often bring up that im doing things that she wanted to do with me. (Mostly outdoor stuff. Hiking etc.) To try and connect with her and show her im trying to change and be a better partner. But its just making her resent me more. I understand her reaction, but i feel like nothing i do can make up for before. The only emotion i feel from her since i left is resent. And i feel like nothing i do will make up for before. What do i do. Do i stay? And if so how doni bring up how im feeling without her feeling like im making excuses to leave her?

His team went out for drinks after a game and she was super friendly with him and told him about herself.  She is from Bolivia and immigrated here with a visitor visa 6 months ago, lives with her family and works in catering. Back in her home country she was a paralegal. My brother didn't read too much into the situation since he figured she was only being nice to me because he spoke a little bit of Spanish. However, she then asked him out to get drinks with her friends and he had a good time. They started hanging out after that - both in groups or just getting food occasionally.

They have hung out for a couple of months now - nothing has happened btw, as she thinks American dating culture moves too fast. Yesterday she told him she was undocumented over text. He didn't really know how to respond, so she continued and said that she feels really strong about him but doesn't want to do anything unless he can be absolutely certain he is okay with her situation. He actually moved on and thought they were just friends, so he started talking to another girl in the league. She noticed this, and he thinks this is what precipitated her opening about her situation. Since my brother came home, the conversation is on hold. He came to me and asked me if I had any input, and since I haven't dated any undocumented girls, here we are posting on here.

I‚Äôve tried talking to him about it, but his main excuses were finals and family since he was really busy around this time. And I completely understood, I mean, who isn‚Äôt busy with family around this time. 

After school ended, and our winter break started him and his family traveled out of state. And are going to be gone all break with distant family. When I first figured this out, I was kind of scared. Mainly scared of how communication was going to go. And I was right to be afraid. So far he hasn‚Äôt attempted at all to text me, even on Christmas. I sent him a Merry Christmas text and a couple of hours later he finally responded the same. I'm convinced if I hadn‚Äôt texted him, he wouldn‚Äôt have bothered to.
