1,q1m27d,1633403176,Is it too much to ask to not have sex before exclusivity? I feel like I'm alone in this,"Recently was seeing a guy I started to like, but we realized we were incompatible because he wants to have sex before deciding to date someone whereas I would prefer to have sex within a committed relationship. I would have been ok having sex if we were monogamous, but he was seeing other people :/ So that ended things. 

Anyway, going forward, how should I communicate this to someone? Is the first date too early? Is it unreasonable? I definitely see his perspective, but also I know I get attached from sex and sex means more to me than it does to the average 20-something, I've noticed.

Are there guys out there who are willing to wait till exclusivity or at least until there's a monogamous situation?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q1m27d/is_it_too_much_to_ask_to_not_have_sex_before/

I know who she was and I think she remembers who I am (because you know she followed me). The only thing being that through out the whole high school years and even 6-8 grade of I thinking knowing each other’s existence we rarely talked, like at all. 
That being said I always thought she was cute, smart, understanding, funny. I thought she filled the role of just being perfect. But I was always to shy to ask any girl for anything and especially her.

It’s been about 3 months since she followed me and we never exchange any words. Should I even try to befriend or maybe even ask her out?

P.S. you may be asking “if I’m to shy to ask a girl out, why are you changing things now”.

I'm 24M and I've never been in a relationship or had a talking stage last more than 2 weeks, I lost almost 150lb and have some loose skin (nothing crazy but it's definitely noticeable, if you've seen the YouTuber Obese to Beast it's nothing like that), have an average ""size"", and a history of mental illness (managed a lot better now but still there).

So I need a girl to be ok with:

1. Me lacking experience and having no idea what I'm doing
2. Being ok with a little bit of loose skin
3. Liking an average size
4. Mental illness / the chance of them flaring up again

I don't think I'm a bad person, and I feel like I have some stuff going for me like interesting hobbies, a good career, my personality (at least my therapist says my personality is good), my own apartment, my own cars, a pet.

4,q1ma93,1633403966,I'm (23F) seeing a guy (22M) I haven't spoken to in a month and a half this weekend...,"I don't know if I'm looking for advice here or just to vent but here we go.

I (23F) was talking to this guy (22M) who was seemingly perfect for me in almost every way. Like it was crazy how compatible we were. And he's a genuinely nice guy, he's not a ""fuck boy"" as far as I know. We talked every day for two months and hung out a few times until one day we had a bit of a falling out. Nothing too crazy, but it happened and we stopped talking as a result.

A month and a half later of not speaking, I reached out to him on Friday and told him I was thinking about him (because I've missed him like hell and haven't been able to get my mind off him this entire time, so I really had nothing to lose). To my surprise, he replied by saying he thinks about me too. Twenty minutes later he proposed plans to see each other this upcoming weekend, and we've been talking ever since. And like I said before, he's not a player (or whatever term you prefer) and I don't think this is some scheme for him to just get laid or something. So I guess I will be seeing him in a few days!

Anyway, I guess I'm writing here because I am unsure how to feel. Do things just go back to the way they were a month and a half ago? Don't get me wrong, I'm pretty happy about the situation (and surprised he responded the way he did), but this is just uncharted territory for me. I don't know. A month and a half is a long time to go without speaking to someone! Maybe I just wanted to get my feelings out somewhere.

6,q1mtpb,1633405998,"How many times do I have to get made fun of, laughed at, or just straight up insulted before I call it quits?","Throughout my college dating career I have learned a few things. A lot of girls (or at least maybe just the ones I’m attracted to) are mean for no reason when they reject you. Like I have asked out a hefty amount of girls, or asked them to hang out, or asked them if they just want to study together, and it’s lead to some pretty crushing rejections.

A lot have told me I’m too ugly for them, some have cut me off before even I finish my first sentence to make sure I know I’d never have a chance with her, one posted our text convo with a caption about how ugly guys keep hitting her up.

I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t taking a toll on me. In fact it’s really hurting me. My self esteem is so low I really don’t even like looking in the mirror.  I see every insult. Every blemish. Every imperfection that makes me unattractive. I guess im seeing myself truly because I used to think I was at least average looking but if I was I’d probably be let down easy. 

I’m begin to hate myself. I mope around thinking about how ugly I am. I’ve lost interest in the things I used to love. I used to go to the gym every day but now I can’t because I see my ugly self in the mirrors. I just hate that this is me. 

Im considering that dating, love, and sex isn’t something for me. I mean everyone’s having sex and dating around in college and I can’t do that.

7,q1myyy,1633406564,Is my friend interested in me?,"I've (20F) been working in a restaurant for about a month. There's a guy (20M) that I work with. He’s a friendly guy, but also a bit of a nerd. I consider him a friend. We know a lot about each other, and we've gone through very similar experiences. When we first started working together (he and I started around the same time), I would almost always be the one initiating the conversation. He'd answer, and he always asked me questions back, but he would almost never initiate. So I stopped approaching him. Since I stopped, he’s been the one coming up to me. Usually, I come into work later than him. When I come in and he's not busy, he’ll immediately come over to my work area and start talking to me, asking me questions about my weekend plans and such. There are even sometimes where he'll come over to me, but he'll stand next to me and won't say anything, so I initiate then. While he’s on good terms with our other coworkers, he’ll normally only greet them hello when they walk in and that’s it.He doesn’t have a conversation with them like he does with me; only about work related things with other workers. 

He’ll also help me at work, to the point where he almost goes out of his way to do so. Of course, he’ll help other coworkers as well, but they usually have to ask for his help, and if he does help them voluntarily, it'll usually be when he's not busy. One time, he was restocking items, and I was helping a customer at the register. I made a mistake and closed it, forgetting to give the customer their change. I didn’t have the code to reopen it, and I didn’t think he had it either, so I was about to make my way to the back to ask another coworker who had more experience. But before I could leave to the back, he stopped what he was doing and walked up to me and asked what happened. I explained to him. He tried to open it, but wasn’t able to, but he tried even though it was inconvenient for him to do so. Another time, he and I were both at registers helping customers. A customer asked for a beer, and without me asking, he got the beer from the fridge and opened it and bought it to me. I could’ve gotten it myself, and he was busy with another customer, but he helped me anyway. The same day as the customer with the beer, another customer asked for coffee. I was at the coffee maker station trying to fill up the coffee cup. Again, it was busy that time, so there was a line of customers. I tried pouring the coffee, but one of the machines was out of coffee and the other one was wasn't pouring. Even though he was helping package food, he took the coffee makers and transferred the coffees for me so that way I would be able to pour it. Even that in itself took like a good five minutes. Another time, a customer asked for a dressing for her salad, and I had to get it from one of the drawers. The drawers were only a couple of feet away from where I was, so I could've easily have gotten it. He was at the register, but he overheard the woman asking for dressing, so he left the other customer at the register and got the dressing for me.

Another thing that I've noticed is that he'll find little ways to touch me. I don't mind at all. When we work together, sometimes we'll be close to the point that our arms graze each other. While it could be accidental, he doesn't get as close to other coworkers. Another time, it was time for his fifteen minute break, and it was only the manager and I working. As he left to take his fifteen minutes, he lightly tapped me on the shoulder and told me he was going to head out. Another time, I was packaging food, and he told me that a customer wanted a specific dressing for the food. But when he told me this, he whispered in my ear, to the point where he was less than an inch away from me. Not that I mind any of this; he's respectful of boundaries, but I just found it interesting. 

Tl;dr - when I come into work, he'll walk right up to me and being speaking with me. He doesn't do that with anyone else. He'll frequently help at work, even when it doesn't benefit him to do so. He also will find little ways to (respectfully) touch me",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q1myyy/is_my_friend_interested_in_me/
8,q1n2qi,1633406968,And this is part of the reason I hate dating app,"Note: I have that I’m not looking for hook-ups specifically stated in my profile!

So I was chatting with this guy from Bumble who seemed like a good guy. We had good conversation, specifically because both of us work in health care and could understand the craziness of our work. Fast forward to a week later. We began texting, and he added me on Snapchat. Tonight, I sent him a picture of my cat via Snapchat, and low and behold, I receive a video of him whipping out his dick in return. 

I’ll be honest, I was pissed. I told him that this is considered sexual harassment and that he could lose his job for it. Of course, he immaturely responded with “🙈😭 you hate me.” SO many red flags in a span of 5 minutes!! I deleted him and came here to rant. This, unfortunately, is not the first time this type of thing has happened, and I’m sure so many other people have or are dealing with it too. 

Dating is so tough these days, and stuff like this is so discouraging. It also makes me sick that some guys think they can do whatever they want with no repercussions, especially when they’re  in a high-up medical position.

9,q1n69x,1633407332,I asked a girl out for the first time in 6 years.,"Tl;dr It went about as well as you would expect and reminded me why dating sucks so much, especially now that I am in my 30s and not my 20s. 

I've spent the last 4ish years putting my life back together after a particularly brutal betrayal and divorce and before that i spent 2 years with my ex. 

Anyway I've recently gotten to know a girl through work. We had good chemistry and seem to be in line personality wise. She recently transferred to a new department where I now see her many times a day in passing and she began making sure to wave or say hi 8/10 times she passed me and it even progressed to short chats and her going out of her way to bring me some candy. That caught my attention obviously so I spent the weekend mulling it over and deciding if I was really going to let myself date after all this time and figured what the hell. She seems interested enough to at least try. 

So I asked her out today (Monday) for this weekend and she said she was busy lol. 

Not a big deal. I knew that was a possible outcome going in given what she's told me of how busy her life is outside of work. 

But it still made me remember why I hated dating so much in my 20s. I was never particularly good at it and it's so much work and guessing and emotional boomeranging I just didn't have the patience or psychological stamina for it. I still don't. 

Perhaps my issue is that I have never just shotgunned it like most men. I've never had much of an interest in casual sex or hookups so I always tended to look for very specific traits in women before I felt like it was worth it to begin flirting or making moves. It seems that strategy is just as poor now as it was 6 years ago lol. 

She did say she wanted to go out another time but I figure the ball is in her court now. If she is actually interested she'll bring it up on her own. It sucks. I really do like her as a person and I think she could be a good complement to my life.

Now that I've ""popped my cherry"" after 6 years of zero consideration to dating or relationships, I find myself feeling like I'm standing at the bottom of a mountain and looking up knowing I have to climb it without climbing gear. The dating landscape is so different now and I was utter shit at navigating it before. 

I want a relationship. Someone to complement my life who I can do things with. Cuddle with. Make dinner for. Hell, even just someone to text throughout the day that wants to respond to me and doesn't do it out of obligation.

I usually don't go out often, and the current situation is very difficult in a pandemic; when I am with someone, I prefer nights when only the two of us do things together.

I have some people with whom I want to share ""good news""; maybe you do the same, you are just waiting for the right person to share with them.

Some of my hobbies: Lego models, reading history, or calming down and creating a painting with two people, which is very good. I am more active and usually like it.

Do some outdoor activities. If you like hiking and adventure, it will resonate with us again. This is a must-have skill. Surfing and diving outdoor shooting training is very cool.

My boyfriends (29M) mom (64F) wants to have a relationship with me, which is perfectly fine, she is a genuinely sweet and kind and emotional person who means nothing but the best. 

While I on the other hand and very to myself, shy in some ways, and not very receptive to emotion or gushy lovey dovey things. A little background. I grew up with 5 brothers, and parents who weren’t overly emotional. I can count on one hand how many times i have seen my parents cry, and or break down. My parents weren’t robots but it’s not unfamiliar to keep things to ourselves unless needed so otherwise. 

My boyfriends mom  on the other hand cries at the drop of a hat, gets emotional over any and everything and is just a wears her heart on her sleeve person all around. 

She and my S/O speak at least 4-5 times a day, i always say hello and ask how she is and we have a brief convo. Here’s the problem. 

His mom  wants to call and text me like we are best friends and I’m just not that type, she has expressed and cried over how she doesn’t like it because I don’t call and text her as much as she would like because “i am her daughter now, and she loves me deeply” 

I do not ignore her, as i said i speak to her and conversate every time she calls my S/O, i just feel like she is pushing her self on me and i am not ready to be so close yet. She’s been in my life around 8 months now, I have done breakfast and visits with her, but don’t know how to tell her she is pushing her self on me and that I am not quite ready to be so close yet. 

I don’t know if any of this is making any sense. But I want to tell her or my S/O that I’m just not comfortable at how strong she comes on and I feel like I should be able to come to her when i am ready. I don’t know what to say without being rude or hurt her feelings. I just feel like if i went to be her best friend i will do it in time. 

She pushes so hard I feel stuck and don’t know what to do. I try to just keep my distance sometimes and hope that me speaking will suffice but she wants more and i am not ready for that.

After years of self improvement and intermittent misery, I’ve sorta got it made. I’ve got a FWB who I sleep with once or twice a week, another girl I see about once a week and with whom I’ve never actually discussed any plans longer term than the next date and I just had a first date with another cute girl who practically invited herself to my place to watch a movie later this week. I’m also still talking to women who message me first on dating apps because to do otherwise feels a bit rude. 

I feel like a dog who’s caught a car; I’ve got no idea what to do next. 

I haven’t lied to any of these women (and I wouldn’t lie if they asked) but I haven’t been up front about dating multiple people at the same time either. I’m not ready to commit to any of them in any case and I haven’t gotten any sense that they want me to, but it still feels a little weird and I feel like my roommates are going to start commenting at some point. 

I’m only doing this because in the past I’ve focused on one woman I’m interested in, only to discover that she’s been seeing multiple people and that she’s now decided to go with someone else. 

Is there a timeline I should consider? Is there a point at which it goes from exploring my options to mistreating or misleading one or more individuals? 

Has anyone else had experience with a situation like this?

30,q1pk56,1633417855,How to get out of the boring personality trait?,"I've (31m) been having this issue for long a time and i personally believe that I have this difficulty of expressing some kind of passion or interesting personality traits.

If I were to ever see myself in 3rd person, I would criticize that this is the most dullest person to ever walk in the dating scene. Which, I have been directly told before on dating apps/irl.

For example;  I dont drink, I have zero love for sports. I find traveling dull, I don't live expressively/artistic, I can only respond with basic phrases.etc.. I also don't get excited from anything anymore to the point where I have to fake it...just to look normal. But I'm sure others notice it's fake.

I'm slowly starting to feel like I'm becoming less human and something more robot like. It's disturbing and I hate it. I have been trying to get out of it in the last 2 years but I still can't seem to progess, instead it feels like I'm regressing.

I’m wondering if any of you know stories of women cheating for bigger phalluses. I’m really just curious about the experiences of others. From what I understand, this isn’t very common. I’m not looking to find out how common it is. I’m just looking for stories on the subject since I have an interesting story involving my friend and some girl he was messing with.

My story is about a Christian girl who cheats on her bf with my friend. The bf comments on her feeling looser. She described to me how much more she enjoys larger phalluses than smaller ones. She said she gets no pleasure from smaller ones.

Again I’m sure this isn’t common, but damn.

34,q1rzr5,1633421734,Please trash me and my horrible choices,"Hey guys, woke up this night and decided I would finally start taking real steps towards fixing my inclination towards toxic relationship and men in general. Part of it is having you all trash me on this post. I will share my most recent experience with an extremely toxic man that has led me to discover that I myself, may have also become a toxic human being (or at least started to engage in toxic behaviour).

I am a 21F. The man I am talking about is a 20M. I think his age should already hint to you at how ghetto this story is going to get. But if not, be forewarned. I met this man at University (we both attend the same school) for the first time in the food hall. For the sake of the story, we will call him Jake. He ran across the room to talk to me and collected my number. This is not such an uncommon occurrence. By no means am I trying to brag, but I have come to understand that I am generally built in such a way that is appealing to men. Slim yet curvy in shape, with an attractive face and thick, long flowing hair. I was not always the most attractive. I remember growing up with severe insecurity issues to the point where I would literally miss important events and lock myself in my room under the notion that nobody deserved to be offended by my ugly face (I now understand that this was a gross exaggeration). I would also chronically undereat and overexercise only to binge at a later occasion and then feel useless; This cycle would repeat itself many times over. It wasn’t until senior year of high school when being thick was finally a thing (The shift from praising Paris Hilton to Kim K) that I finally embraced my figure, grew the confidence to stop wearing baggy, unflattering clothing and paid more attention to my upkeep that I started receiving all sorts of male attention. You can imagine that going from absolutely no male interest to people literally stopping their cars on the street and tracks in the hallway can really change you. I relished in the newfound attention. I became addicted. I made it the main narrative in my life. This obsession with the male gaze still continues to persist in my life over 5 years later. 

But back to the present. I never ended up calling Jake. It wasn’t until one party where I spoke to him and then finally decided to respond to his messages. I messed up severely and slept with him on the first date. It was probably the best sex i have ever experienced in my life. Not that he is particularly large. Just slightly above average. But really it was the crazy sexual chemistry that we had where every time we fucked it literally felt like an explosion that finally came to head. We started dating less than a week after the first date. Quite literally every time I saw him after that we ended up in bed together. We quite literally could not keep our hands of each other. He was exactly my type. Tall, and amazing beard, with these insane hair waves that were his pride and joy (he literally spent at least an hour a day maintaining these). 

Our relationship was horrible except for the sex. Horrible communication. I continuously tried because I really wanted it to work. I was so into him, and it seemed like he really didn’t care. I felt like part of the reason he stayed was because so many people, even complete strangers would hype him up for being able to date me. But once he had me it was like he felt like he didn’t need to put in even an ounce of work. He would talk to me anyhow. I even remember that I was struggling financially at the time and on days where I wouldn’t eat, I would ask him for just one bite of his Subway sandwich (this is because I never expected him to give me anymore).... he would give me one piece of lettuce. I would always call him and try to converse with him and he acted like I was disturbing his life. He would rather play video games or hang with his boys. In fact, it was the day that he said to my face, “I would rather be with my bro’s than be with you.. in fact, I would rather sit and stare into space than hang out with you.” I literally did NOTHING wrong to this man. Not to mention, I have quite a few friends that can vouch for me being one of their most fun and interesting people to be around. But he would never know this, because he never even gave it a chance. On the day he said that to me, I finally called it quits and walked out without talking to him for months. 

The months without him were extremely hard, however. I couldn’t stop thinking of not only the amazing sex we had, but the fact that this man would literally be my perfect man if he just behaved the way he did at the very beginning, or in those one off moments where he was sweet. That perfect man literally lived in all of my dreams for months. 

One day Jake messaged me, asking to hang out. I agreed. He FaceTimed me that night and we talked until morning. I missed him so much. We went to a restaurant and ended up rubbing on each other’s legs and such under the table. It wasn’t up to 2 minutes or leaving the restaurant that we had sex in his car. Afterwards, he told me that he wanted to make it a regular thing. Just him and me, doing friends with benefits. I knew it was going to be way too complicated because I still had feelings for him, but I agreed just because I couldn’t imagine going without him again. Long story short, this carried on for months with me under the stupid impression that maybe, just maybe, we might date again. One particular afternoon, we got into an argument after sex and he said, “I see you as nothing but a prostitute. You are literally like a hooker to me.” I was so taken aback because I quite honestly couldn’t believe that anyone, even your worst enemy could fix their mouth to say those words to somebody. I knew that for the sake of respecting myself, I could not see this man again. I called things off, blocked him on all social media. But I didn’t block his number because I still had a glimmer of hope for us, in my infinite stupidity. I know that you guys are furious at me at this point in the story. I am pissed at myself to. I don’t understand why I keep allowing this man to have such a hold on my life. I keep trying to distract myself and it literally is no use.

Speaking of distraction, I did not talk to this man for 1.5 years after this incident. In fact, I even went on to date a man that treated me like gold and spoiled me to my hearts content. Someone so madly in love with me.  But being the person my am, I went and broke it off, because I genuinely did not know if I was ready to settle down for life at 21 and that is were the relationship was strongly heading. Anyhow, immediately after the break up, I go to a bar and of all people, Jake is sitting there, looking amazing as usual. I control myself and don’t speak to him for the entire night. It wasn’t until I got home that night that everything started again. I couldn’t even sleep because I was obsessing over this man. I know he probably slept just fine that night. So me, who has literally never messaged a man in my entire life and probably never will again, did it. I sent Jake a message, 

“Hey, just thought I’d say hello since we didn’t speak last night.”

He responds and we chat for over an hour. He asks about my last relationship and to be courteous, I ask if he is seeing anyone. In my head, I already know what the answer is. It has to be no. I mean, this man was literally not a relationship man whatsoever until we started dating. He expressed to me on multiple occasions that if we ever broke up he would never go through this, “bullshit” again. 

“Yea I’m seeing some girl been a few months.” His exact words. My heart felt like it dropped out of my chest. I was shattered. I knew I had to stop it. This had to be the end. I couldn’t do that to another woman. The thought of cheating infuriates me. 

I go to sleep. 4 am rolls around and I wake to a text from Jake. He is ten minutes away from me. He wants to meet. I couldn’t bring myself say no. I rolled out of bed, entered his car. I knew deep down in me the sequence of events to follow would be as always. I went anyways. As expected, the expected happened. He then proceeded to tell me that he was having issues with his new girl. That she was a virgin and she wasn’t really into sex like that. That they would try but sometimes it would be too painful or not go. That they only did it once a month. I felt like crying. I am evil. I am disgusting. I started remembering my first year of University, losing my virginity to my boyfriend. How frightening and exciting the experience was. How it didn’t go in for a long time. How we kept trying. How he was not a cheating asshole. I need to stop. I am not only hurting myself but have now hurt an innocent human being, and at what cost? I am vile.

From past experience, I know that I could potentiallly have almost any man I desire. Yet to this day, I am fixated on Jake. It is ridiculous. It has gotten to a point where I even feel too ashamed to talk to my friends. I am embarrassed. I repudiated by myself and by my actions. I want to be free of him. I have texted Jake, saying that I cannot be involved with him now or ever. I want this to be the last time.

36,q1s54h,1633422549,Did I ruin my chance?,"So yesterday I (25M) was headed down to do my laundry and as I enter the elevator I see this really pretty girl who's definitely out of my league. Let's call her J. I see J has her laundry too and I gather enough courage to strike up a conversation (just basic stuff like how Sundays are the worst for laundry and so on). Something I should tell about myself is that I'm a bit socially awkward and find it hard to keep conversations going with strangers, especially good looking girls. But with J we ended up talking way more than I had expected - about my recent camping trip, our colleges, where we're from, and so on. It was the first time in I don't know how long that it didn't feel awkward at all, and she seemed to like talking to me too. She even emptied someone's (finished) laundry from a machine since none were free and I told her I don't like doing that to people. After loading the washers she asked me if I wanted to take the elevator together again and I (obviously) said yes. At this point I really wanted to ask her out or at least exchange numbers but got too nervous and decided to wait a bit, since I would probably see her again in half an hour when it was time for the dryer.

I go down again after a half hour but she's not there yet, so I hang around for another half hour and she shows up. We talk some more, she empties a dryer for me like before, and even offers me a dryer sheet. We take the elevator again and my nerves get the better of me like before. I tell her I'll hopefully see her in an hour (when the dryer is done) and convince myself that I'll ask her out then.

She's not there on time again after an hour, so I hang around like before but she doesn't show up even after 2 more hours. I start to panic because at this point I cannot stay and pretend like I ran into her again because it would be too suspicious. And the probability of running into her again anytime soon is really really low (I have been here about 4 months and this was the first time I saw her). So I get this idea to write her a note on a piece of paper. Something like:

&gt;Looks like I missed you.  
&gt;  
&gt;Anyway it was really fun talking to you today! Let me know if you wanna grab a coffee or lunch sometime. I'm still new here and looking for people to hang out with :)  
&gt;  
&gt;(XXX) XXX-XXXX  
&gt;  
&gt;\- AmbitiousAd3873

(Btw there was no flirting involved when we talked, so I didn't wanna suggest going out for something other than coffee or food)

I stick it in the door of the dryer she had used and go about my business. But later on I start getting worried that the note might have been too much, seeing we had just met. I go down after a couple of hours to try taking back the note if it's still there but the note and her laundry are gone from the dryer.

Anyway, she hasn't called or texted. The note was pretty tightly stuck inside the door so I'm pretty sure she got it. I know it's still pretty early and I'm not too worried about that. What I'm worried about though is if she might have considered it a bit creepy or desperate. What do you think?

37,q1s9sy,1633423274,She rejected me because she was too scared of..suffer?,"Ok so, I'm currently going to study in a pretty far city from my hometown.  
I'm basically running from this place and I knew her on a groupchat of the university.  
She is also running from her city and the people there.

We started talking and literally spent 2 wonderful weeks speaking about EVERYTHING.  
Unfortunately, due to my parents, I couldn't move myself as soon as I wanted to (and i'm still in my hometown rn).  
So she spent 2/3 weeks without me in the city we're going to study, meeting people and always reassuming me she has another guy in mind, me.  
She even invited me to sleep to her place for a couple of days in order to see each other and spend some time together. Which I couldn't, because my father didn't wanted me to go alone there(yep, cringe).  
Everything collapsed a few days ago. I went to the city with my father in order to find a room for me and she started ghosting me and after a quick rage in chat, she told me that she was too scared to suffer again. In that 2 days, she started seeing a guy SHE DOESN'T LIKE just because she was too scared of having a real thing with me. A friend of ours told me this guy took her to the station and kissed her. Which literally killed me.  
I literally came back to my home after 3 days without seeing her. We fought each other on my way back. She even admitted that she would leave that guy if she had the courage to POSSIBLY ( AND SHE KNOWS I DONT WANT IT) suffer again.

Yesterday she posted a story with him and rapidly hide the stories from me. Then went to bed.  
She is not only lying to me but also to herself. Maybe she doesn't like me, but i'm sure she doesn't like that random guy she just started seeing.  
I wrote her a message before and asked her to choose between that guy and me. I already know she won't choose me, but i just need to hear it from her.  
We will talk in a few hours since both of us have lesson right now.  


btw, i'll move to my new house there in a \~7days and this thing is literally ruining me from the inside.

38,q1sgpi,1633424328,I feel like I am undatable.,"To give a little context, I am 28, straight, male, white, Canadian.  Why I say this is because of the following.  12 out of 14 relationships have been them having problems with me for an assortment of reasons which will become evident.  Online dating has resulted in naught but ghosting.  Having done some serious thought on the issue, I keep coming back to the saying about if everyone you meet is an asshole, then you’re probably the asshole.  If that makes any sense at all.


Some things I have identified about myself that in addition to the above, are reasons I have come to this conclusion.  In no particular order.  Hopefully not being too long winded.


Politically, I am generally Conservative.  Not in the “abortion is murder and gays should burn” kind of way, but otherwise right leaning.  I have only ever met two women with similar ideology.


I currently have zero kinks and a low sex drive.  I have tried some of the more “tame” things at the request of previous partners, and even so much as fuzzy handcuffs turns me off so much I would just rather not have sex.  I understand it’s not just about my wants and needs, and always do my best to please my partners, but as soon as the subject of kinks come up, immediately kills the mood about on par with someone wanting to watch videos of people stepping on kittens.  Going without for a month doesn’t bother me in the slightest, and have done so by accident several times.

I will always, with no exceptions, put my own wants and needs first when there is no  negative to them.  An example, I want to take my holidays to go on a month long trip.  They don’t get holidays so an extended trip with them is out of the question.  So I say “I’m going on a trip, see you when I get back.”  Or buying something somewhat expensive, I just do it because there is no consequence to them.  This has also proven to be extremely unpopular.

My communication skills are absolutely awful, borderline autistic.  (I exhibit almost all the symptoms of a person with ASD).  I am not very good at getting my points across which often leads to miscommunication.  I also tend to be very blunt and if I think they are wrong about something I will say as much, and will absolutely side against them in an argument if I believe they are wrong.  This alone has cost me several girlfriends.  Between this and severe social anxiety, It also makes meeting women rather difficult.

Work Hours.  I work 3pm to 11pm Monday to Friday.  Changing jobs is not an option, and it has proven difficult when I don’t wake up before they leave for work and don’t get home until they’re asleep, and absolutely detest being woken up so they can say “bye.”  Basically makes any relationship weekends only, also hasn’t proven popular.

So yeah, that’s my laundry list of character flaws and other issues I believe make me unsuitable for relationships.  Kind of wondering what your takes are on the subjects I just raised.  I will once again apologize if it got rambly and for formatting errors due to mobile.

So.... There's this girl I started talking to via a dating app who is really cool. She shows interest, the conversation was flowing and was a really good one. I'm attracted to her. As I'm very picky, she exactly the type of girl I'm looking for. For example, she doesn't drinking, she's into old fashioned romantic and she's the plain Jane type.

After the conversation for 2 days, she stopped replying. I prompted only once and left it for a few days without response from her. I then left her a message saying that I wish her well in her search etc. A few days later she replied saying she's been really unwell and doesn't get notifications from the app so missed the messages (but yet she was replying within a few mins when we first started to talk). I said it's all good and no need to apologise.

She then said she'll reply when she's feel better to which I said absolutely and there's no rush and hope she felt better soon. It's been a week since then and 2 weeks since she initially stopped until saying she's not been well.

Who is so unwell for 2 weeks or am I just being incredibly naive and she's just ghosting me now?

I still had Tinder on my phone and a girl (my current GF) messaged me. I replied and the convo had a good flow and we met. Things went quite fast! 

Both of us were alone with the difference that I was uncertain about getting into a relationship (told her at the beginning) and she wanted a relationship. We went on a trip together the first month and then decided to move in together. 

We rented an apartment together and have been living together since. 

I love her and she loves me but at the same time, I feel stuck! I feel like I made a terrible mistake and got into something that I'm not ready for yet. I miss my space and I miss my independence and feel like being alone is a better contribution to my mental state and growth at this point but at the same time feel very guilty and don't know how to put that out. I feel very confused and under pressure. It's been more than one month that on and off I've been feeling this way (it started when we went on our second trip to another country).

I'm not sure if I could give a vivid picture of my current state as English isn't my first language and I'm not very good at expressing myself clearly (as you can see from where I am!). 

This Sunday I want to tell her that I'm not ready for living together while I thought I am and I want us to stay friends but not live together, but I'm not sure if that's the right decision and I don't want to hurt her (which probably is inevitable for both of us).

63,q1v3lo,1633435939,What to do about feelings you don’t want to have?,"Alright so, I literally never post here but I’m looking for some advice. There’s a new girl at work we met about a month or two ago, give or take. 

Literally ever since we met I’ve felt something for her like a very small crush or interest, but logically I feel that we are better off as friends for several reason. 

One, she is quite a bit younger than me, in a different part of her life, two, she’s in a fragile state currently, still getting over her ex, and three, I am very aware that I tend to catch feelings rarely, but when I do, a bit too quick and so even if there was a future there I’d wanna slow down and be friends first. I also just haven’t been focused on girls at all lately just been focusing on myself. 

So I never admitted to myself or anyone else that there were indeed feelings there. 

Deep down I knew I felt something, but I was sorta forced to really accept that and fully acknowledge it last night when I and some coworkers went out because I found myself feeling jealous when she was talking with one of my friends who had spoken of her a few days prior in a derogatory and vulgar way. I called him out on it but part of it is that I know that if given the chance he would most likely take advantage of her being in a mentally dark place based on knowing him and what he himself said. 

The feeling of jealousy honestly bothered me though, like I felt like I shouldn’t feel that way.... but it was definitely evidence that I have a thing for her. And this morning I feel like everything is intensified and more real and scary. I don’t wish to have these feelings but I do. Because I honestly think that she probably just needs a friend more than anything right now. 

I know I can’t choose my feelings, only how I react, but I’m hoping they will pass soon. Thanks for listening to me ramble... If anyone has any advice I’d love to hear it.

He walked me home and we were kissing outside. He said he wanted to come up and meet my dog and keep talking. I told him maybe another night, told him I don’t want to rush things. 

After some more back and forth about him coming upstairs, he said it was early and he really wanted to keep getting to know me. He agreed we would only talk and have another drink. I did genuinely want to keep talking, so we went up to my apartment. One thing led to another, and after kissing for a while we ended up having sex. I wanted to in the moment and it was great. But immediately after I felt awful. I told him I don’t usually have sex on the first date and reiterated that I want more than sex. He reassured me, then we walked my dog and he went home.

I’ve slept with guys on the first date before and I’m tired of just being wanted for that. I’m trying to change and to make it special for someone who actually wants the long term with me. I think I’m regretting this time so much because I was so explicit that I didn’t want to go further, and he kept making excuses for continuing the date when that’s probably all he wanted out of it.

She gave me her number, unsolicited, and we continued our conversation. It was going really well I thought. Made plans to see her this Friday when we'd both be a little more free. She seemed really excited about it, as was I.

This morning she bailed on our date, saying she was too busy and had exams coming up so she'd be disappearing until they were done. I am inclined to believe her, but there was no indication that I should reach out again in 'x' amount of time once her schedule had calmed down.

I'm pretty bummed, not going to lie. I hadn't been so excited for a date since my first date with my second girlfriend back in 2013. I guess that's Tinder for you.

I just left it at: ""Sure. If after exams you want to try again, you've got my number."" Probably not the best choice of words considering I was genuinely interested in getting to know her as a potential partner, not just a Tinder fling. Might reach out again in a month or so, but we'll see.

Basically, I don’t know where I’m headed in my career, if I’m doing what I’m truly meant to be doing and a lot more. I think the reason I’m even in this place is because of my upbringing. My family values hitting goal posts in life - getting a fancy job with fat paychecks, buying a house, getting married and having kids and I just never thought I’d be 28, single and worse - unhappy with her career! So it’s like I have nothing figured out and sometimes I don’t feel successful. 
In 2020, I met someone who was in the same boat but with a better perspective on things! We were both software engineers who despises the people we work with, enjoys coding 8-5 for the money, and didn’t know who we truly were and what we wanted to do. But he was always okay with that, honest about it and with him, I felt like I could shamelessly be myself and admit that I’m still figuring things out. That relationship was short term and we just decided to be friends.
Since then, I’ve made some progress. I’ve landed a decent role (something I actually wanted to do), got closer to my friends, understood myself a little better and found some interesting activities to do etc. It’s not great but it’s something... I feel like I’m moving! 
I met someone who is a successful professor (36m). He truly loves what he does and is extremely passionate. Also, he plays in a band. He legit plays awesome guitar, and drums! I’ve been on 5 dates with him now. We have good conversations and we’re both attracted to each other! We do have guitar playing, music and coding in common but whenever we talk about it, my mind automatically compares me to him and I feel unsuccessful and stupid. I play 4-6 chords and I’m just all right at my job! 
I feel like I need to be someone else so that he can be attracted and engaged ... someone who has herself figured out! This is 100% my anxiety and overthinking because when I am myself around him, making jokes and what not, he ll hold me and say he likes that I’m funny and interesting! And I know being myself is just enough - but it’s also scary and I am truly intimidated by him. 
For our next date, we are going guitar shopping and he wants to jam after. I said yes to jamming and feel pressured to “perform”. If I were jamming with the guy I met in 2020 we’d just make funny lyrics and call it a night lol. 
How do I stop trying to impress, perform and just be myself? 

Tl;dr- I 28f am dating a 36m guy who is successful and I’m still figuring myself out. How do I stop myself from performing and trying to impress when I feel intimidated by him and be my authentic self?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q1xwf9/advice_how_do_you_date_someone_successful_without/
85,q1xxrq,1633445533,"Do any other guys he’ll like it’s super depressing to see a pretty girl, or even just a girl you’re slightly attracted to?","Like when I go out in public and I see a girl they I think is really attractive it’s just demoralizing. Because I know I would just be wasting both of our time if I said anything to her. I have this one class that has this one girl who I think is gorgeous and it just seems pointless to talk to her. She’s so out of my league it’s not even funny. When I’m walking around campus, I often find myself trying to look down when a woman crosses my path because I just feel lesser because of the way I look.

I think I have positive qualities, just my looks are so bad and I can’t fix it. I’m not fat. I’m in okay shape and work out 8 times a week. I my friends think I’m pretty funny. I make them laugh a lot. I wouldn’t say I’m universally funny though. My girl friends are constantly trying to set me up with their girl friends because they think I’m a good guys and be a good partner. 

It’s literally just my appearance. My forehead is massive. I have bug eyes, and big lips, and a big fat move nose, and I’m black. It’s just things I couldn’t fix. And that just leaves me unable to talk to any girls I’m interested in. 

Like 90% of women are out of my league. And I’m only attracted to like half the the women in my league, and 99.9% have no chance of ever wanting me. It just feels so pointless to talk to girls.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q1xxrq/do_any_other_guys_hell_like_its_super_depressing/
86,q1y11n,1633445906,is it unrealistic to expect 30+ yr old men to act like gentlemen these days?,"34/f here. been out of the dating field.

i was with my ex for 10 yrs from the ages of 18-28 and after we broke up. i decided to take a break from dating as i was heartbroken from the relationship.



i felt it was unfair to date when i still loved my ex..so i spent years being single working on myself. poured all my time into my hobbies and career and leveling up 


had lots of men ask me out during the years but i just wanted to focus on myself so i haven't been on a date in years.


i feel like i am now ready to date and start a relationship again. i am fully over my ex and have my life together.


the problem is when i was 18. which was over 15 yrs ago. it was pre-tinder and a different time.


the men i dated which included my ex were all gentlemen.


for example. my ex paid for all our dates, he was polite. on our first date. he showed up dressed well and with flowers. he didn't pressure me for sex. he didn't even kiss me on our first date. we did hold hands on our first date and we only kissed on the 2nd date.

he was a complete gentleman. anyway that was 15 years ago.


i understand times have changed but is it unrealistic now to find men like this these days that behave like gentlemen??


i haven't started dating again yet but i browse reddit alot and the stories i read on here are off putting. 


makes me think i am better off just being single and alone??",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q1y11n/is_it_unrealistic_to_expect_30_yr_old_men_to_act/
87,q1y1ul,1633445998,Do I (F29) message M28 or leave it?!,"In August, met a guy through mutual friends, slept together that night. Complete surprise and one of the best I've ever had. 

Next day, he said it felt like we'd been doing it for years and he wanted to do it again when he visited in September. 

He lives about 3 hours away. 

Slept together again and said we want to again but didn't make a firm plan. 

Last week, I sent a voice message saying there's a party this weekend he's welcome to come and did he want to spend the night before with me. 

He said he couldn't listen to it then so I said fine, let me know when you have. He only knows it's to do with us having sex, not that I'm trying to make a plan. 

Still haven't heard from him. I know he's been busy (didn't see my ig story until Monday when he usually always watches) and the whole social media blackout. 

Do I wait? Do I reach out? - what do I say? 

We have spoken relatively regularly before and the attraction seems beyond the physical. Ultimately, I don't mind jogging it slightly as he could have forgotten and has no idea it's actually time sensitive but also don't want to be pushy/needy when so far this is chill. I just enjoy him and have time to see him so would like to.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q1y1ul/do_i_f29_message_m28_or_leave_it/
88,q1y30c,1633446100,Did I ask her out?,"Few weeks ago, I (M19) saw a girl (F19) in my school and thought she was cute. Our schedules don't match so I manage to see her only once per week and thats just passing by because she is in the same classroom once I leave. Everytime I saw her we made eye contact and greeted/smiled. I told myself that the next time I see her, I will ask for some form of contact. (English is not my native language but I will try to translate the following conversations as accurately as possible)

Next time I saw her I approached her and said this: ""Hey, I don't see you often so could you give me some sort of contact for you so we can talk? Messenger or Instagram for example?"". She nodded and said ""yeah sure"" and added me on Facebook. We parted ways.

I got stuck in traffic that evening so I messaged her around 8pm. The conversation went like this...

Me: Hi! I wanted to message you sooner but my bus got stuck and I had to find another way home... How was your day? :D

Her: Hiii, yeah no worries. You must have had a fun ride home. I was out with my friends for some food and beer so that was fine.

Me: I didnt even eat today. I must go to the store to buy something. Maybe I will go tomorrow but it will probably be closed wont it? (It was some one day holiday)

Her: All the stores will be closed for sure so dont stay hungry 

Me: Speaking of tomorrow, do you have any plans for the evening?

Her: No I don't, why?

Me: Look, you seem cool and I would like to get to know you better. So I figured we could go somewhere together tomorrow

Her: I would like to, however what time in the evening? I have plans for the afternoon

Me: 8pm+?

Her: Yeah that should work, if not I will text you before

Me: Okay I am looking forward to it

Her: Me too :D

My question for this part is: would you consider this as asking her out on a date? Were my intentions clear? What do you think?

Anyway, we met and went for a walk in the park. She didnt talk much but rather listen and there wasnt much physical contact. When the moment seemed right I tried to touch her hand and we held for two minutes but then her phone rang and after she checked it she didnt put the hand back so I stopped. We ended up at a bech and sat there talking until the park closed. There werent many awkward pauses because I had a lot to talk about but it bothered me because she seemed uninterested even though she actively listened and reacted. After 2 and a half hours I accompanied her to the bus and we parted (without hugging). I thought it was the end. However...

I texted her afterwards

Me: Hey, I enjoyed meeting you but I hope I didnt talk too much :D. If you want to go out sometime again, let me know

Her: Hey, it was actually fun and I would like to listen more about (stuff I talked about).

We texted more and she actually talked. She told me more through the texts than in person. So my impression now is that she was shy and thats why she didnt talk much. The physical part is more tricky and thats why I am asking your opinion on this. Were my intentions clear about trying to date her? We talked about meeting again but the first meeting happened a week ago and we didnt set up another yet. Just occasional texting.

96,q1ynmu,1633447305,He's a Bad Texter,"I (23F) have been dating this guy (31m) for about 2 months everything has been going well. I think he's funny, kind, we have the same religious background and he's consistently taken  me out on nice dates (AKA he hasn't solely invited me over just to hook up). he even asked me if I wanted to be exclusive and I agreed to that. We live about 40 minutes away from each other but would manage to see each other at least 1-2 times a week. I've never dated someone that didn't live in the same town as me so while the distance isn't too far the communication has been a little difficult. When we were first getting to know each other he would send the standard goodmorning/goodnight texts. He would even send me little tid bits about his day which would spark good conversation. But one week he didn't respond to my texts for 3 days. I called and talked to him about this and he said he was going through some stressful events with family and work. I told him I understand that he needs space but in the future if he could just let me know when he needs space so I don't assume he's ghosting. I then gave him space and we did not talk for about 4 days. Then he reached out to me apologized for being distant and we went on another date a couple days later. It was so much fun! But now it's happening again! I have initiated all of our text convos since the last date(  which he has barley responded to) and now it's been 3 days since I've heard from him, again. It's really bothering me and I'm not sure what my next steps should be. Communication is really important and I don't want a relationship where I talk to some every 3-4 days. Am I being demanding/clingy? Is this normal? 

TLDR: I've been dating a guy for about 2 months who initially talked to me everyday but now will go 3-4 days without responding to my texts. He's voiced that he's very interested in me but the lack of communication has me worried.
