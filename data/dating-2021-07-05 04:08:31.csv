Rewind to last week when I go on a second date with this person. All is going well, my stuff is at there’s and we go for a meal and a few drinks.

About 5 hours in her friend calls her and she’s crying her eyes out. I’m like fair enough you go and sort your friend just let me know what’s going on. 

This is at 22:30.

An hour passes. No message.

Another hour passes. No message. 

By this point I cannot get the train home and my car is in the city. I was drunk so I could not drive. 

Another hour passes and she finally messaged to tell me to go home. Yeah cheers for that I’m now going to have to spend £50+ getting a taxi home. Luckily I got a lift. This is at 02:00

I go to hers the next day to get my stuff and she tries to explain herself but honestly I didn’t want to hear it. She didn’t have the respect to tell me it was going no where and she hasn’t opened a message which I sent on that day.

No ‘sorry for wasting your night’ or anything like that just silence. I can only say at least I dodged a bullet here but it still hurts nonetheless to be ghosted like that after you’ve spent £90 on a date already.

If you’re on a date you have a responsibility to communicate with that person and it’s as simple as that. If she had told me to go home shortly after she left I would of been fine with that. It was the lack of communication that wound me up.

Don’t ghost people. It’s not healthy behaviour and it hurts a lot more than rejection.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oe40tr/getting_ghosted/

9,oe4gqd,1625480389,Feeling embarrassed and demotivated,"So straight to it ..

Matched with this guy online and so did a friend ( major awkward- we didn’t realise and only found out today lol). 

Now, I only recently matched with him. All up maybe a few days of texting ( basic stuff, I.e- how’s your day etc..) and one very short phone call . 

My friend and the guy had previously exchanged numbers a few years ago and they dated briefly. They met online as well, I don’t know how things ended between them then, but he felt comfortable enough to send her a message a few weeks - Just a little before we started talking online . 

I felt the phone convo I had with him was dull and felt right from the bat he wasn’t my type. 

But the embarrassing thing is , I was super excited to talk to him on the phone and get the ball rolling. Whilst I kept checking my phone and overthinking that I was perhaps too forward and wondering if I was coming across desperate , this guy was giving no fucks. 

Granted he didnt know me and I was obviously talking to multiple guys . I felt like I put him on a pedestal ( when i shouldn’t have) and had high hopes ( for no damn reason lol) . 

I feel like in comparison to my friend, maybe I was the boring choice ? 

Lol we have very different approaches when it comes to men. I find her to be assertive and would just call a guy if she wanted to talk to him, right from the beginning. 

Where I would be cautious, and feel like I don’t want to intrude in a persons life and ask when it would be a good time to chat- especially so early one. 

I had one really shitty experience, where I felt like I kind of over stepped this one guys boundaries- where I would just call if we were texting back to back in real time. I’m so mindful of that one experience which made me feel like shit and now I’m doubting myself and perhaps taking things too serious ?

This news really sucks and I am disappointed but overall we were only going to be in the same town for about 6 more weeks before she is moving away anyways.

What sucks the most is I felt us getting a pretty good connection with one another and we had a great time when we were together in person.  Things seemed like they were moving quickly between us.  Has been a while for me since I have had a good connection like that with someone in the dating world.

All in all, I really had a great time with this girl and while it is not exciting to start fresh from scratch again, I am looking forward to having this experience moving forward.  It’s tough when you think you find someone you really like but it’s just not really something that will work out in the long run.  Just got to keep going back out and meeting other people!

13,oe4zya,1625482751,How would you compensate your inability talking about your boring childhood/school time?,"Hi guys,

I've noticed that I really struggle when it comes to talking about my childhood with other people. When I listen to what all of my friends have experienced in their childhood or school time, I'm just sitting there agreeing and asking them questions. But I can NEVER talk about my experiences because there were none...

So, what was my childhood like? I come from a very conservative and strict family. My parents are all about grades and that's it. Everything they say is right and everything I say is wrong. Shouting at me because I got a B or a worse grade was pretty normal. I would go to school learning and go home learning. I did have friends but I've never played with them after school. Something like 'family time' never existed. Also, I didn't have any hobbies at that time. If I had any it would be playing computer games and nothing more (if you can even call it a hobby). There is just nothing that I can mention that was actually positive in this timespan, literally nothing.

The list is way longer but I somehow try to keep it short. 

All in all, I left highschool with a pretty boring life and pretty bad self-esteem. 

In the end, when I moved out, I basically had to teach everything myself, may it be cooking, doing the chores, common human sense/rational thinking etc. to the extent that my former coworkers say that I'm the perfect stepson which made me quite proud of myself. 

Now, I'm studying for a higher degree at a university. 

I've never had a girlfriend or any kind of romantic relationship with a woman. So, what am I supposed to say when my date asks me how my childhood / schooltime was like? I am pretty sure that this question will pop up anytime but I just don't know how to answer this question... 

Do you have any advice for me, please?

14,oe4zyx,1625482753,I don’t know why I was so scared.,"I [22F] haven’t ever had a partner, as far as my parents are concerned. This isn’t true, of course: I’ve had several, I’ve just never told them. 

I’ve had boyfriends much older who I was embarrassed to tell them about. One when I was a teenager, and one much more recently. I’ve had girlfriends too, and I just wasn’t ready to tell them about my sexuality, so I never did. 

Anyway, about six months ago I began dating a friend of mine [24M], and it’s been so wonderful: he’s kind, he adores me, we have great chemistry and we love spending time together. The sex is amazing too! I’ve known him for years, and it’s been so lovely getting to know him more in our new relationship. 

That said, I was never very content with the relationship because I felt like it had one thing in common with my other relationships: I wasn’t open about it. Out of habit I was keeping it secret from my parents, from my housemate, my friends, even our mutual friends. 

It had been six months, and I was getting fed up, so I made myself tell people. I met his parents. They’re lovely. Slowly, slowly. I told my housemate. I told my parents. I told my brother and I told my friends. 

But I was still scared, and I didn’t like mixing my family life with my home life. Eventually my parents got fed up and arranged to meet with me and my partner for dinner in London, where we all live. I was terrified! I was so scared, I was worried about what they’d think - about what he’d think. 

They loved him. I don’t know what I was so scared about. It turns out that they didn’t want me to date someone ‘just like them’. They just want me to be happy, and I am! 

So if you’re in a similar position, just do it!

15,oe50gw,1625482808,Talking to a high school crush after 4 years,"Gonna try and condense this as much as possible. I met this girl in my senior year of high school. I was very introverted and she basically initiated most our conversations. I'm bad at reading girls but we sat next to each other and played 'footsies' under the table in the Spanish class we had every weekday. She's also put me off balance once while I was walking to the busses after school. I'm bad at reading girls as I mentioned but I'm assuming this is flirting. 

Anyways, I decided to ask her out (still don't know how I managed to do that being so introverted at the time). She told me she was still getting over her Ex and wasn't ready to be in a relationship. I should also mention she didn't have a phone and I only talked with her during school. Towards the last days of my senior year, she wrote me her address to mail to her in a book she handcrafted for me (She has a passion for art&amp;craft to this day). It honestly hurt me so much on the last bus ride knowing I might not see her again. She also had strict parents so I stopped mailing her after the first attempt of getting a response.

Fast forward 4 years later, I'm nearing the end of my first enlistment in the Airforce. She's finishing up her degree in psychology this year. I was moving locations on base when I came across the book she gave me with her address. I gave it another shot and mailed her with my phone number on the bottom. To my surprise she texted me back. I was filled with pure excitement and not being as introverted as I was, I wanted to talk a lot more with her and start initiating a lot of conversations.

And this is where I started royally messing up in my opinion. I started initiating 95% of our conversations. We've had about 3 phone conversations where she initiated 2 of them. But we mostly texted each other in the last 3 months. I would try making humorous conversations. We both have very different taste in food so I'd send her pictures of food I'm eating that she wouldn't like and we would have an entertaining conversation over it. However most her responses are one liners while I can't help myself but text almost 3x as much as her. She still responded back to me most the time. However it felt like it was a chore to respond to me. She's a very nice and innocent person so maybe it's in her nature to be nice to everyone. 

We would continue the food conversations a little longer until I mentioned I'd be taking leave to visit my mom's house (which was close to where she lives). We talked about potentially meeting up to try ""good food"" if I ever came in that area. Then a few text messages in, I told her that I still had feelings for her.

Then I decided to have a phone call with her about my feelings for her. I basically told her that she was one of the only people that talked to me since I was introverted and I asked her if there was anything about me she didn't like. She said there wasn't anything it was solely her thinking about her ex at that time.( I still wish she had told me something other than her ex because it feels very one-sided having me confess all the things I like about her). She also mentioned me being in the Airforce would be conflicting like her ex that was in the national guard.

 A few days go by, I'm still initiating every conversation and texting 3x as much. At this point it feels like I'm annoying her. She does have a busy schedule but it still feels like she's just annoyed of me or thinking of someone else. I have mentioned multiple times that I might be annoying her but she's denied that i am.  I'm currently at my moms house and I asked her if she was still down to get food which she replied ""I'm not sure"". I really didn't want to push this anymore because I think I'm annoying her even though she's denied that I am.

After multiple one line responses (and sometimes no reply back until I initiate the next day). I'm gonna try not texting her back again. It sucks though because every hour of not texting her feels like a year. And being an introvert most my life, it hurts to know that the one person that cared to have a conversation with you probably has no interest in linking up anymore. From the conversations we've had over the phone, she's not seeing anyone. Maybe she actually finds me annoying or she's into someone else she hasn't told me about. She has mentioned she likes ""teasing me"" over the phone and she mentioned a quote from her mom saying that ""she only teases people she likes"". But after me confessing my feelings for her again. It seems like she's lost interest in me. 

I just woke up with a dream about us getting married. After mentally hurting about trying to forget about her, I can't stop thinking about her. I've told her things in my life that no one else knows. She's told me a few things too. I thought there was something for us having that amount of trust to trade information like that. Even if I try to stop thinking about her I have dreams about her, I think I'm going insane at this point. 

What should I do guys? Do I try to continue my strategy of not texting back in the hopes she initiates? I can't stop thinking about her. Maybe what's  best for her is me not talking to her again. Was she just playing with my feelings? I honestly don't know what I wanted to hear from you guys but I'm hurting everyday mentally and maybe some comforting replies or advice might lift my mood today.

Consider this situation where a casual fling is acceptable and quite normal because one definitely needs someone to discuss and share stuff with and bond on an emotional and physical level. And they don't take it forward coz it's a casual fling or some other factor. I totally agree that it's a choice. But at the back of my mind I think that the person is a bad judge of what he wants, or is not strong enough. How can u bond emotionally and physically and then say hey it won't work out or be OK about it. I understand honesty is great and all so kudos to people who do this but I have seen at least 90% times , nobody has any problem being ultra casual with each other.

21,oe5myh,1625485350,My POV,"A personal rant.

I truly believe that Social media and the internet in general has affected dating in a negative way. It has created new easier opportunities to meet someone. But that is a problem within itself. You see so may people go from relationship to relationship. And i believe that's because alot of people have a 'safety net'. This is a person or situation buried in there minds incase something goes wrong with there SO. Safety net's have been around forever, but social media makes this ridicilously easy to access. How can you truly start a life with someone when your literally prepared for that relationship to end and sub consciously planning a life without them just incase it goes wrong. Why do you think so many people end up in the friend zone, or a partner stays in contact with a past lover and they say they are just friends?. That's her safety net and she can't let go, because that feeling of being wanted and feeling secure means more to her than any partner will. And as soon as you stop making her feel that way they will. As a result people aren't trying to make it work and talk through it as much as they were because when a situation becomes difficult they can just move on to the next person who has been in there mind since you was together probably. That guy in her DM's?, the extra nice girl from work?. Men do this as well, but it's significantly higher in women because they are more emotional and crave that feeling of being desired and feeling secure more than a man would.

To be precise, I drive about 2 hours to get there. I used Tinder there and matched with a girl. We've been writing for a very long time and getting along really well until I even asked her out on a date last week. The date went pretty well. We drank boba and went for a walk and talked all the time. After the date, we both agreed that we could repeat the date and grap some food, when I get back there again. The problem, however, is that I won't be back until September because the summer holidays have started. So for a long period of time I would have no way of being near her town. So how can I make it clear to her, that I want to see her again for a second date without coming across as needy? I mean suggesting to drive 2 hour only to see her for a second date (and also driving back 2 hours) would come across as needy, no? The tension between us still feels very casual and second dates should also be casual imo...The good thing is that she'll be moving in October, so it's only an hour drive away from me, but I don't know how to handle the time between now and September/October. I've already chatted a lot with her and I can already see that the topics via chatting are slowly running out. Videocalls would be an option, but I have no idea how to initiate a videocall with her. Also I'm afraid, if I suddenly ask if we can videocall, it might come across as strange.

43,oe8npq,1625495784,What should I do?,"Been seeing a girl I met at a bar 2 months ago usually 1-2 times a week. We’ve stayed at each other’s places and get on really well, intimately and emotionally. She has had some bad experiences and isn’t sure she is able to commit to anything down the track and she told me early because she still wants to keep seeing me but doesn’t want to get my hopes up in case she isn’t ready. I was happy to continue doing what we were doing so we still have been seeing each other. She explicitly said she doesn’t want to feel like she’s holding me back in case, for example, a “really hot girl” approached me and wanted to start something. However, she seems to be a bit more confused and since then, has become even more physically and emotionally intimate, complimenting me, touching me as often as she can and being extremely affectionate. She has opened up about a whole bunch of things and is definitely comfortable to the point that it’s well beyond friends with benefits. However, a waitress at the bar I go to often (who I added on Facebook a few months ago) popped up randomly and struck up conversation. I talked to her when I came in on dates but was just friendly with her and all the other staff. She said she’s bored because of COVID and wants me to come visit her at work for a takeaway beer and was being quite direct and flirtatious. She then also asked if I’m “still seeing that girl”, the girl above who id taken on several dates to that bar. Now I’m in a situation: I’m not going to lie to anyone and I’m not committed to anything but I don’t know what to do:
Should I continue playing out what’s happening with the girl I’ve been seein? She’s not sure if she’s ready for something but she’s clearly changing how she feels since that chat. I’m happy to see how that goes but I don’t want to miss an opportunity that literally presented itself
Originally, I was going to see the waitress and have a catch up and suss out what she’s thinking but her question about the girl in seeing kind of requires an answer. I’m thinking of saying “she told me she doesn’t see things going anywhere so it’s back to the drawing board”
I’m not in a committed relationship I just want to do right by everyone.

Thing is it’s Monday and haven’t heard back, we talk a few times everyday back and forth so we are good in terms of communication.

47,oe94r1,1625497207,How should I ask where I went wrong during the courting phase?,"Women of Reddit,   


I recently was dm’d by a girl who is in the same program as me in school who did a promotional event with me (separately though, as we had never met before this past week) and we really hit it off! We have since met up multiple times and I thought it was going well, albeit nothing romantic as she had her parents around the past week and one of the hangouts was with a group of friends.   


I admittedly am a bit shy initially, so I don’t feel like I put my best foot forward during these moments and over this past weekend when I asked her out on more of a one-on-one date she mentioned that she doesn’t know what she wants since she is graduating soon and wants to go travelling in the new year and doesn’t want to be in a relationship for that (which I totally understand). She mentioned that its either friends or relationships with her too, no fwb as she’s not that kind of girl (which again, I really respect), but then she said that she would love to stay friends as most of hers had graduated and left recently. The rejection obviously hurt as I felt we’d connected and I stood a really solid chance with her, especially since she reached out first and was flirty at the beginning and we have a ridiculous amount in common. Plus, I can’t help but feel like she’s just trying to be nice and that it’s a no forever from her as she doesn’t see me as a romantic option, but is taking the “easy way” out and playing the “lets stay friends” card.   


Part of me wants to simply walk away and stop talking to her because she didn’t just straight up say, “not feeling it romantically with you, but would like to still hangout as friends”, but also a part of me looks at what she said and maybe I’m being too cynical. Plus another voice in my head says “if you hangout and become more comfortable, she will see the real you and might change… who knows?”. I’ve only ever had luck dating past friends, so that’s how I’ve had luck in the past…   


So my question: Since she wants to remain friends, I want to ask her where I went wrong with her. If you were in her position, would that be a weird request? I’m sick of always being the “good friend” no one can date and there is no way to fix that other than getting to know where I went wrong.

48,oe97wn,1625497458,Recently became exclusive but she (31f) didn’t invite me (32m) to a 4th of July pool party she went to yesterday,"This wonderful woman and I have been dating for about a month and after a string of awesome dates &amp; hanging out, we decided to date each other exclusively.

Fast forward to yesterday. She’s known she’s going to this 4th of July party for a couple of weeks now, and I honestly was expecting an invite but one never came. She asked me what I was doing for the 4th and I told her I was invited to a party that I knew was going to be wild but didn’t want to go since I was no longer playing the field.

On her way to the party she FaceTimed me and looked great in her swimsuit – it was a pool party – and she said she would see if she could invite me after she got there and saw if it was the type of thing she could invite me to.

Now, of course my bullshit alarm was going off the charts. To me her saying she would “see if she could invite me” was basically her saying she wanted to see if bringing sand to the beach was wise. I mean, she had weeks to ask if I could be invited and what I saw on IG indicated no one would have cared if I was there. I likely wouldn’t have gone anyway with such a last minute invite but still.

I’m a little upset and I don’t know if I should be or have the right to be. It seems like she’s playing the field still and I’m not one to be someone’s backup plan. Plus, I would have been more than happy to invite her to anything I was going to and can’t really think of a reason not to unless I wanted to see what else was available.

How would you guys feel in this situation? I’m not sure how to proceed. I like her a lot but this situation has rubbed me the wrong way.

Backstory on how we became exclusive: 

I am usually dating several woman at a time since I know people can be fickle and that I’m incredibly (annoyingly) picky. I fucking hate dating multiple people at a time but have found it’s a necessary evil.

We had only gone on several dates, and after me crashing at her place for the second time and doing the thing, I asked her the next morning how she felt about multidating and I told her I could honestly see both sides of it. After she told me she was only seeing me, I told her I wanted to only date her and asked her if she wanted to officially try only dating each other.

I quit gaming just 2 months ago so I pretty much spend the day browsing the web for learning random facts and watching videos and doing minor workouts. I know a lot of girls are into gaming but I got completely detached from it (not for dating/social reasons).

My social skills aren't too bad for interacting with people. However, after joining some social clubs on Zoom (due to Covid it's on lockdown), I did talk to people and show interest in their hobbies and stories. I'm usually the last to come up with a story or have the shortest story.

One of my biggest dating fears is whether women will accept me for not having initial hobbies. How can I keep a conversation alive? And what kinda story am I supposed to tell that's interesting? And how can I even make a dating site profile without any hobbies because imaging taking good pics without hobbies.

Despite that, I am certainly willing to try new ones that if I get in a relationship. I know people say you should try new hobbies first before dating but I want to be in a relationship then pick up new hobbies at the same time. Are women really open to having a guy with no stories/hobbies/interests to tell but is willing to try new stuff (perhaps a S/O's hobby if dating)?

I try to be respectful, mannered and generally ladylike. Is this not an important value in today's dating? I've noticed a trend of men being extremely lazy in dating and I am very frustrated by it. For example, for the past few dates I've been on, I took an hour and a half to get ready not to mention how much money I spent on grooming to ensure I made a good impression. The guys showed up in some version of a stained tshirt, baseball cap and old gym shorts. It was infuriating to consider how much time and money I spent to nice meanwhile he couldn't even be bothered to put on clean clothes. Some highlights of dates include someone going to the bathroom and staying there for 30 min right when the check came out, someone else requesting I drive an hour each way to pick them up and drop them off because they were planning to drink during the date and another one trying  to gauge the possibility of having sex as an icebreaker and another one demanding I pay for the first five dates we go to as proof that I'm not a gold digger. 

My ex and I broke up because he wasn't putting in any effort into the relationship and I am quickly finding out that the guys out there aren't that much different. I match with someone on a dating app and even though I'm not extroverted, I try my best to hold up a conversation over text and be lively only to be hit with one word responses or sexual innuendos back. 

The unwillingness to make a good impression to a complete stranger and the total lack of respect is infuriating.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oeb742/the_lack_of_effort_and_respect_in_todays_dating/
64,oebbss,1625503872,Tell me about your Reddit connections,"I used to have a sexy reddit account. And would usually just write off the DMs as one off sexy chat. (I don’t any longer and please don’t take this as license to harass me in my DMs)  Sometimes I’d make some connections that became go to fun. So I didn’t think much of it as I started to talk to M. 

But as the days, then weeks, and then months started to go by my outreach to others slowed down. I ended up losing access to my account (seriously verify your account if you give a shit about your content) and didn’t feel any desire to start posting that anymore. My attention was totally stolen by M. We began to have a friendship, one that was honest and grew to something genuine. 

Our connection had me looking at myself and the things I could do to make myself better for me. I wanted to love myself so I could be open to the love I wanted. So that I could love better on other people, like M. 

I watched as M became softer, more patient and understanding from our connection. That we each rubbed off something special on each other. 

I watched as our hearts both began to open. And this past weekend M came to visit me from the west coast all the way to the east coast. 

They were even more amazing than I thought they could be. My 2-D version was not even close to giving them justice for how kind, affectionate, playful, passionate and full of life they were. 

While I continue to also learn a mentality of no expectations, I know this connection has allowed me to get to know myself better, and be more patient and compassionate and to have more faith in myself and others.

65,oebc3m,1625503901,how to deal with this paranoid crush?,"I got a new crush but it is obsessive and making me miserable, it has triggered a new depressive episode and I don't know what I am doing with my life.

&amp;#x200B;

He has given me mixed signs and initially, I thought he liked me but now I wonder what happened and if I did something wrong or if I was too eager.

&amp;#x200B;

I met this guy at a party (22 yo, I am 21yo) and we introduced each other, during the party a girl told me to come close to her and he was near so he talked for a couple of hours or more. He seemed engaged and interested, he is Japanese and we talked about culture.

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed he mirrored body language but I didn't think much of it, we overheard the topic of relationships and he told me that you cannot kiss until the relationship is official etc I was very surprised because it doesn't work like this in here.

&amp;#x200B;

He asked if I ever been in love and he mentioned he had a girlfriend but I misunderstood and I thought he had one now. He walked me outside at the end and asked me for my IG and number.

&amp;#x200B;

After a few days he texted me and for a while, he always texted me first, asked me If I was coming to the school activities and asked random questions just to break the ice. At some point I started having a tiny crush and he texted me 3-4 times a week, sometimes less.

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't sure if he was friendly so I tried to flirt, we often made eye contact and he smiled a lot and seemed happy to see me. Once I left early and he asked me why I was leaving early, I said he could come to my residence if he missed me.

&amp;#x200B;

I also made a joke on text if he missed me because he was asking a lot if I was coming to places, when he asked back I said ""can I say yes?"" but I was trying to be flirty only and I made another joke but nothing too sexual at all. After that he didn't text me for a whole week and I panicked, what made me think he liked me is that he is outgoing around other people but shyer around me, he touched me lightly more than once or when I touched him he didn't move, he seemed helpful about stuff, he looked at me but looked away when I looked at me, but he didn't speak to me much in groups.

&amp;#x200B;

When I asked advice everyone said to ask him out because he clearly liked me, maybe he was shy and something was holding him back. I became paranoid because I wasn't sure if it was a good idea as a girl, I didn't want to seem too eager.

&amp;#x200B;

I was very anxious and miserable but I did said I wanted to get to know him, he said yes but his texts got slower (a few hrs to reply or even 12-24), his texts were short and he didn't have many initiatives so I got turned off and canceled last minute.

&amp;#x200B;

No texts again for several days until I thought fuck it and asked if it could be a date, he said it could be a date, let's see how it goes (in Japan it is a date only after the relationship is official apparently, I asked a Japanese friend here and kinda said you need the confession and making the relationship after hanging out with no getting to know period).

&amp;#x200B;

I was like ok but then the day came and he said last minute he had a family problem because his brother has a fight at school, he had to talk to him on the phone (we are abroad and he is going back home in a few months), he didn't seem to lie but I overreacted because I thought he was dismissing me.

&amp;#x200B;

I said if you are not feeling it it is ok but he wanted to reschedule so I said yes, he told me he was available on Wednesday, I said it was ok but I had to check my schedule. We didn't text each other at all and he never texted me again, on that day when we were supposed to reschedule we went to a school event and I thought it was an indirect polite way to reject me. I was hurt but in the end I noticed he was looking at me and smiling a lot, the same night when I left he asked me what I did in the afternoon and he was a bit awkward. I asked for a hug but it was quick and he even patted my back...not very intimate but I know Japanese people don't like PDA.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked if he wanted to hang out or not he said yes and he was going to text me, this was 5 days ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel miserable because I know interested people act interested, I don't think it is a petty mind game and I keep overthinking and feeling anxious. Everytime I research signs online the results are bad such as not texting a lot or not texting first, postponing dates tec

&amp;#x200B;

I fear being hold as a backup and how could I have misread signs so bad? I can't stop overanalyzing and this has triggered a depression attack all over again.

&amp;#x200B;

When I saw him last night we didn't talk but we don't talk much in groups and he is outgoing and flirty with everyone but me, sometimes he gets close to me and talks when he is drunk and smiles a lot but he is friendly in general. There are many negative signs, sometimes he is dismissive in person or text (like we were alone and he always asks me if I am leaving or staying, I said once as a joke I could stay if he wanted me to stay but he as like I am going downstairs with the boys/other guys in the residence wtf?)

&amp;#x200B;

He is in the school group and he often participates to activities so I cannot avoid him. I went on a date with a new guy and I'm getting new ones thanks to FB dating but I am super stuck on this Japanese guy for some reason.

&amp;#x200B;

He seems a bit strange, sometimes he seemed nervous and smiles a lot, he looks at me then looks away, sometimes in groups, he doesn't pay attention to me at all, he gets close but then he doesn't make a move, sometimes I don't hear from him at all. The last time he texted me it was 10 days ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought he was pulling a slow fade because of lack of interest but then he approached me again, I want to move on but at the same time I want to see if there's some hope.

&amp;#x200B;

We both really enjoy the time we have together when we're not at work, or when we are able to visit each other. Throughout the progression of our relationship, no matter what I do to try and get my girlfriend to realize that she's very attractive, she doesn't see it in herself, and it's very hurtful to hear or see text messages of her saying how she thinks she's ugly, or that I deserve a better-looking female. She unfortunately has been sexually abused, as in she's been coerced into kissing, having sex in sketchy places, and touching her in places she never consented to. I've tried getting her into therapy and tried convincing her to testify in court against her ex, but she refuses to accuse him of sexual assault, and has very rarely attends therapy appointments.

She seemed rather shy, but I enjoyed the date.  I texted her a couple days later and she told me she was uncomfortable.  She apologized that she didn’t speak English well and said that it was her fault.  

I want to see her again.  She is very shy.  She doesn’t drink and told me how she has only been in this city for 3 weeks.  I am not sure if this is a dead end.  I just don’t know how to proceed.

I like her because she wore a dress on the date.  She likes being outdoors and she challenged me when I teased her.  I really need to put some energy into this.  I just don’t know how I should respond to her text.  

Also, I don’t think moving on to the next target is the best option.  A lot of pick up artist would say screw it just text a dozen other girls and prove to the universe that you are an Alpha.

I am a 24 year old dude from Germany who never had a relationship. During my undergrad, I really focused on studying a lot and did not go out as much. When I was 22, I started to look more actively for a partner and had my first kiss/sex. Some months later the pandemic started, I moved back to my teenage room and started to use dating apps. Had some matches but the fact that I knew that I will move again somehow blocked me. I then finally moved out again and started going on dates in the big city I live in now, but nothing worked out, sometimes the women weren't interested, sometimes I wasn't. It is also a blockade that I will bedoing a 6 month internship in a foreign country soon and a semester abroad in another foreign country after that and I kind of always had this in the back of my head when dating the women, like it ""does not work out anyway"". Okay, enough boring stories about my past, but now I see more and more old Tinder matches entering long-term relationships and I had several panick attacks about the fact that I think it is very, very unusual to never have had a girlfriend at that point, and I am just scared that this will never change. I am also thinking it was a stupid idea to initiate this ""internship abroad"" thing, because it is again only a temporary phase of my life and I will lose another year and then will be a 25 year old who never had a relaitonship.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oebsr4/i_am_completely_tripping_right_now/
72,oebth9,1625505372,Tips for getting back into dating…….,"I am 25 years old (26 in October) and for a bunch of complicated reasons, my life fell into shambles…..I became unemployed, was living with my grandparents, and I gained a lot of weight. So I wanted to take time away to find a new job, lose some weight, and find a place of my own. And now that I’ve done those things, I feel like I am in a better headspace to start dating again. 

But I need some tips:

1. It’s been almost a year since I’ve interacted with men so I am really shy with “putting myself out there” again. This includes dating apps or trying to strike up a conversation with somebody in a coffee shop and then possibly asking them for their number if it goes well. How do I overcome this shyness? 

2. I actually enjoy my job but my days off are Monday’s and Tuesdays. This might make it difficult to plan to plan a first date since most people’s days off are Saturdays and Sundays. And what if i can work around that and then things become serious. I am just a natural romantic at heart so it kind of makes me sad that me and a potential boyfriend might not be able to just spend an entire day together relaxing around the apartment in our underwear. I remember I used to be able to do this with my last boyfriend and that was the best.

Everybody exchanged their Instagram and other social media, and she followed me first. After I saw her (amongst 6 or 7 other follow requests, everybody from those groups), I immediately followed her back and started a conversation. This was at the start of last winter semester (October 2020).

We texted for about 3 weeks straight, every day, almost the entire day. But after that, it died out. I went back to my home country because the college told us that the entirety of the year will be held online. We talked to each other, but only sporadically (mostly by replying to each other's stories on IG, for holidays, etc.). She later added me first to the ""close friends"" (which I saw as an absolute W), but that's about it.

I went back only once, for a few days (at the start of April 2021, to pick up my visa). As I got back home (as in my home country), I saw she finally arrived at our college (but different faculties) and the country we're ""studying"" in. She wasn't there before, as she has some visa problems. So we missed each other by such a small margin (like in the movies). That was the last time we heard from each other.

So... How should I proceed forwards? I really like her, or rather fancy her. As Covid slowly gets under control, it's more than likely that we'll be back to live studying in a couple of months. We'll finally be in the same town. Any advice on what should I do? How should I do it?

92,oedmdu,1625510885,How to date when both people work different times,"This girl I've been on 2 dates with (trying to organise 3rd date), she works shift work (including some weekends) and I regularly work the same times everyday... It is getting really hard. Obviously plenty of couples work different times, I know that, but how do they manage it? 

I know it's only dating, but the question still remains of whether she does like me but I unquestionably like her anyway, so i am trying.

Does anyone have any suggestions? I don't currently drive either (should pass my test soon hopefully), so have to rely on trains and buses and she drives drives meet me...",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oedmdu/how_to_date_when_both_people_work_different_times/

But like, the difference between wearing fitted jeans and a button down and wearing a t-shirt and shorts a big deal to you? I'm genuinely curious!

94,oedq3v,1625511195,What's an important lesson you've learned from previous failed dates?,"Mine is to always be honest.  I used to do my best trying to solely put my best foot forward that I was ommisively leaving things out.

This painted a picture of something I'm not which created anxiety.  When she later learned the truth, she was pissed.

Lying, even by omission, is a total deal breaker.  

Now I'm just confidently honest.

The day before the date, she apologizes and says that she can’t make it because of a family gathering. She didn’t offer to reschedule and it’s been a couple of days of not hearing from her. I’m assuming she isn’t interested anymore, but she still follows me on social media. What do y’all think?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oedxgp/should_i_move_on/
98,oee44s,1625512342,How to keep a long distance relationship going?,"So this guy slid into my dms a week ago and we have been talking ever since. He seems great. Problem is, we are 10,000km apart.

But i will be traveling to his city for university in around 2 months so the end is in sight, i just don’t know what we should really talk/ text about without learning everything about each other before we even meet (id like to be able to learn more abt him in person)

We have planned our first date and called each other a few times. Any ideas to keep the spark going?

We are in quite different timezones so things like watching a movie tgt might not be feasible.

I didn’t even ask him to go with me. To make it even better he followed that with “you wanting to go to something like that means our political views are probably not the same” I’ll leave that for you to interrupt yourself, but I’d say I have to agree on that.
