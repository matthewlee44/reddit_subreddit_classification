I get a fluid amount of likes on my profile weekly and about half a dozen match-backs on the likes I've sent per week (so about 10% or so?). Of the profiles who've liked mine, I match back with maybe 25-30% of them, and I'm usually doing so out of curiosity and being open-minded. I've probably had hundreds upon hundreds of matches over the course of the past 6 months, but only received two in-person dates from it, and they were not really all that great or compatible.

If I'm being honest, though, it's all the same. Most people can't carry on a basic conversation even when they are the ones who sent the like in the first place. The matches I actually am interested in disappear after two or three days, or they are too far away and our schedules conflict too much to realistically make anything work. The rest of the matches carry on conversations, but I can tell there's really no chemistry between us and it feels like a conversation for the sake of conversating. Add in all the other typical hurdles you face on dating apps with barely ever getting in person dates, people flaking on plans the day of, or standing you up, and it's telling that it's not working.

I don't think I'm burned out on dating apps, but after being on both Hinge and Tinder since September of last year, I fully understand now that dating apps are just a tool and not the solution where in order for them to actually work, it really is a stroke of luck of matching that rare person where there's actual connection, equal effort, and the other factors such as lifestyle compatability and ability to meet. There may be hundreds and hundreds of profiles on those apps, but coming across those people is realistically not there for most of us, especially if you don't live in a big city.

I was 19 and she was 21. We ended up not being compatible. I wanted a relationship, and she was a bit scared and called it off. I know she never dated anyone ever, ever kissed, ever held anyone's hand, etc.

She is looking to date present day and my sister (the person who originally set us up) said if I feel like I wanted to I should message her. I do not know if I want to do that. I don't dislike her and she doesn't dislike me, we are just on different wavelengths.

To give a recap of what happened, it was date #4 and I held her hand. She got spooked and did not like it. On date #5 I asked to again and she said she no longer wanted to date me. We did hug on date #3 and I called her cute and she was flattered.

I think she was very isolated and innocent growing up. That is not really a bad thing to me, I just don't really want to do anything that makes anyone uncomfortable. I know she told me her friend left her boyfriend because the boyfriend asked to have sex. I think these two girls thought sex was a very bad thing, and you should basically never do it. I have no problem if people think that in general, and I am not going to have sex with someone that doesn't want it obviously, although I'd think if I was in a relationship with someone we would have sex eventually. I had sex with previous girlfriends before, my friends all have sex with their boyfriends/girlfriends, so I feel like it's just another part of a relationship.

I would hate to go out with her, hold her hand again, and spook her even more. But, if I am going on dates I want to eventually have it go somewhere.

TLDR

So a quick introduction about myself. I'm M/25 college student who for my entire life had been extremely anxious and introverted. I had previously never dated anyone before in my life. I was focused on other things. 

Last year I decided to simply forget my anxiety and straight up start approaching women, and to my surprise it somehow worked. I never thought it would.  I ended befriending a girl in one of our classes, and I guess I left an impact on her because by the end of the class we exchanged numbers, and she looked me in the eye and said ""Thank you for making this class so fun. You're really awesome and funny."" I was really shocked that anyone would say that.  

So to make a long story short, we've never been on a date one on one but we have become extremely close friends and hang out in groups with other friends.  How close is this really...?

1.) We really have not gone a day without texting each other over the past year.

2.) She called her parents and asked me to speak to her mother as a joke. The point is she felt comfortable letting me meet her relatives which I was surprised about. 

3.) We've gone out to eat not one on one but with me and another girl, where she insists on sitting next to me every time. We've probably done this five or six times. 

4.) I'm at the point where we talk about and can tell each other anything. She's already told me about her past relationships and boyfriends, and that she wants kids. 

5.) Her family lives in another part of the country, and she's frequently talked about moving back away from me because she doesn't know how I feel about her. However, she literally told me that if I ever visit her that ""You would always have a place to stay with me."" 

6.) We complement each others outfits all of the time, and she jokes about talking about me with her mother. 

I'm really not sure what my next move should be or how close this sounds to being a relationship. I've never dated anyone before so don't want to massively screw this up. I want to still remain friends if she doesn't see me in that way. I really love her and we have a huge connection but she doesn't know I love her. I feel it would be sad if we drifted apart but I understand that may eventually be a possibility so I'm prepared for it.

So I (25F) have been dating a woman (24F) since we were freshmen in college and it's been about 6 years. When we met she was with someone, who she broke up with to be with me and that person continued to stay in her life as a part of a big high school friend group.
In 2020 we took a break and I slept with someone, didn't tell her, got back with her soon after but I confessed that I had slept with someone 2 months after it happened, out of integrity and respect. 
At that point we broke up, but still tried to work things out and couldn't stay away from one another. 
5 months later I find out that soon after we got back she had slept with that ex from the beginning and they were talking since we broke up. This was completely heartbreaking. She could have told me when I confessed, but she didn't. When I found out she begged to believe her in that I was the one she wanted to be with, but she wouldn't stop being friends with her. The summer progressed and she actually went to a summer vacation with that ex and some other friends, at this point we are still fucking and like, romantic, but there's no trust. When she came back from that vacation she said they had a conversation where they agreed that being friends was better and she had learned her lesson in not messing with her romantically. 
Since then our relationship has been great and super loving, but in the back of my mind I still am suspicious. 
Recently we travelled together for valentines day weekend and it was beautiful. We had a great time at a hot springs, somewhere new we've never been. But when we got back I checked her phone, and saw that she recently deleted all messages with her her (I knew they had been texting just recently, as I saw she was one of the suggested ppl to send photos to that pops up on an iphone) and there was an exchange on Twitter where my lover sent her a meme video of two people getting married on the train in NYC. The ex replies ""you and me?"" My lover replied ON THE MORNING OF OUR ROMANTIC DEPARTURE, ""yeah but on the C train"" (the train they used to take together). 
She swears it was a joke, taken too far. And that she hasn't betrayed me. 

I don't know what to believe. This makes me look so stupid but I love her so much. I'm tired of the distrust.....",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1160251,public,self,Should I forgive or move on...,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sxe4h6/should_i_forgive_or_move_on/,no_ads,0,,,

He knows he can eventually break you down to give him a second chance. They don’t care if you’re happy or not, they just want to feel comfortable knowing that they got you as a plan B.

This is why I say, if a man has done you wrong and you break up with him, make sure that he’s literally dead to you. Cut off all connections to him, all the access he has to you, dead it. Block him everywhere, every new account he makes, block it with no hesitation.  Tell any mutual friends to not discuss anything that has to do with you to him. If he asks them how are you doing, tell them to tell him, that you’re good. There’s literally no reason for y’all to ever speak directly. 

If somehow he catches you in person, ignore him or cut the conversation very short. You don’t have the time. 

He wants closure? No you don’t need it. The disrespect was the closure. That’s all you need to know. You let them speak, you’re giving them opportunity to possibly manipulate or gaslight you.

That goes for women who don’t have kids with him. If you do, then y’all don’t really have anything to talk about if it has nothing to do with your kids. 

Also just as a reminder for anyone who needs it, do not have his child if you see some characteristics in him that you don’t like.

Unfortunately, we’ve only gone on 3 dates since then. We’re trying to schedule a 4th date, but he just seems too busy and he’s a horrible texter. Should I just drop him? 

——-
More context: 
We first matched at the start of December and I noticed he was bad at responding to texts. Like he would literally just send one text message a day so one topic would last days. I lost interest and faded out after a week or two of texting. 

He messaged me almost 2 weeks later saying we never got to meet up. We finally arrange a first date and I didn’t expect us to click so well. 

We couldn’t meet for the next 2 weeks coz I caught COVID. (He did mention he was busy as well)

We finally met up late January and the date went really well again. As in we had dinner at 6pm and talked at a bar until 2am or something. I ended up sleeping over at his place and we fooled around but didn’t go all the way. 

We arranged for Date 3 two weeks later and hit it off again. I stayed over at his place and we finally did the deed. 

We talked about meeting up again and he’d come over to my area of the city. I asked him about his availability right after the 3rd date so we could block out our schedules. He told me he’d let me know by end of last week. I still haven’t heard from him. 

It’s been two weeks since I last met him and I’m starting to question whether this is worth pursuing. 

We’ve been meeting each other 2-3 weeks apart and I’m not sure if this is going to get better. He’s really great when we meet but he’s a horrible texter. He sometimes won’t get in touch until days later, when it’s time to start talking about plans. 

I haven’t heard from him in 5 days and this also happened when we were setting up our 2nd date.

He’s treating you bad but he still wants sex from you. His energy changes and he becomes distant but still finds time to have sex with you. Take into consideration the kind of sex you’re having with him. He doesn’t care if you finish, when he finishes that’s the end of the session. No aftercare. Goes back to behaving the same way as he did before sex. Sometimes the sex is good though, let’s not get it twisted. Otherwise we wouldn’t have people who stay in relationships because of good dick and good coochie.

They just kind of string you along, they don’t want you to be with anyone else because they know just about anybody could treat you better and you’re not at their disposal anymore.

Open your eyes. I see this happen with a lot of women my age. Nothing but sex is holding those couples together. And the women don’t really get anything out of the sex. From what they tell me, they’re literally used as human fleshlights.

She messaged me and we seemed to have a nice and casual conversation. She's new to town so she doesn't know a lot of people yet. I the did something I don't usually do and asked if she was up for going for drinks and she said yes!

So, we meet up and hit it off (I think) and end up talking over a couple drinks. I then suggested we go for a walk but it was raining so we ended up in a coffee shop for a quick pick me up and then continued our way. While walking in the rain, I asked if she was up for grabbing a bite to eat and she said yes. We ended up going to a ramen place she had seen and just keep talking about life, work, study, politics etc.

After hanging out for 5 hours, we part ways and I later message her to let her know I had a good time. She says she did as well and suggests we continue chatting on whatsapp, so I give her my number and we chat a bit there and she seems to be interested in meeting up again soon. I end up waitinf until midnight as she mentioned it's her birthday today and she seemed to really appreciate that I did that. 

Now comes the part where I'm not sure what to do... She seems somewhat interested and I'm definitely interested. I just want to make sure I don't come on too strong yet make it clear that I like her. I don't want to just blurt it out over text and would rather wait at least until we've been on another date. But how could I bring something like that up without making it too awkward? And how much texting would be too much? I'm going to message her tomorrow to ask if she had a good birthday, but after that I don't know what is considered 'socially acceptable' in terms of frequency.

So...This is kind of an embarassing question, but in my continuing quest for understanding...Here I am. Lol.

I've noticed that the guys I have the strongest connections with have  had slightly ""too close"" relationships with their moms. Boundary issues,  poor sense of Self, trouble separating from their moms, guilt over  their mom needing them, etc.

Sometimes I get along with the moms - sometimes not. Sometimes we never meet.  They're almost always guys who were raised mostly by their moms and have  poor connections to their dads. Sometimes they're aware of this,  sometimes not. When I notice this, it's hard to bring it up bc I don't  want to disrespect their relationship with their mother.

I  would describe myself as fairly nurturing, helpful, and  independent...And I def have tried to reflect on my own behavior and why  I attract these ""types"".

I'm slow  to get close to someone (I've had my own emotional  unavailability/vulnerability issues) but I've worked through a lot and  am getting better. I now am much more comfortable and open but I feel  like I still end up finding partners who, ultimately, can't get past a  certain point of commitment.

When  we first date (up to like the 1 yr mark) - that's fine. But then I want  more closeness or progression (in the form of moving in together, more  commitment, more intimacy, them challenging their own intimacy  issues)....And they always end up feeling controlled or smothered, and  things blow up. They want me to remain independent and not need them and  not want more.

Help please lol. What else can I do to address this in myself, or pick partners differently?

But when I want the relationship to progress  to more serious commitment or for them to let me in more in some way, they always end up feeling controlled or smothered and I can't push past it with them. Things blow up and inevitably fall apart.

First of all I'm not the most social person you will find I'm more of a ""man of few words"" so to say. In general this doesn't really bother me since I get on really well with my friends and they are used to it, but the problem is that because of this I'm not really a ladies man.

Now whenever I meet a women I am interested in I find it hard to engage in a conversation with them since I just don't really know what to say most of the times. Online this is not that bad since I can always think a minute about what to say before I open their message but irl I obviously can't do this. Because of this I have almost 0 female friends like the only female friends I have are the ones that where already in/got in the friend group because of my extrovert/talkative male friends. And I'm not even close with them because when we get together with the group I'm a quite person and don't really talk with them a lot.

This makes it really hard for me to find a romantic partner. I very rarely go to a women at a bar, club, etc. because I'm such a quite person and don't know what to say to them. And if I meet a women online we end up talking about her like 90% of the time since I don't know how to make things about myself sound interesting and I find it rude to just randomly start talking about me when she didn't ask about it so I just ask about things that have to do with her day/life. Because of this I also get the feeling that I'm just constantly being used as a complaining tool and after they are done complaining about what's going on in their life they turn to someone more interesting/talkative. 

Even if a women literally says that I'm her type and that she finds me attractive I just don't know what to do or say to keep her interested in me :/.

Im also always nice and respectful to them apart from the occasional joke, and I also frequently compliment them if I am interested in them but neither of those things seem to work since I always get ignored, rejected or the conversation just gets so dry that I can see they aren't interested in me at all.

I don’t have anyone to talk to about this so posting here.  

I was sitting in a cafe at my school today, I walked in and could tell this girl was staring at me.  I sat at a table behind her, and later when she got up we locked eyes twice as she was gathering her things.  She then came over and chatted me up for a minute before her class, apparently we are both new to the school and thus in the same student organization (though I didn’t remember her).  We also happen to be in a class together.

This girl is so beautiful.  I know she was just probably being friendly but I’m not the most confident guy when it comes to situations like this.  I’m a very average looking guy and short, she’s taller than me.

Anyway, I’m sure this wasn’t a sign of real interest beyond a conversational level, but I assume this is an invitation to at least talk to her in class?  My nature instinct is to avoid initiating convos with good looking women in person who are def out of my league

I won't pretend it's never bothered me, but I'm working on that. This is not a post complaining about that, or blaming other people for something that may well be in my power to ultimately fix, even if I don't know how right now.

One of the biggest barriers for me personally, and I'm almost certain I'm not the only one, is the way people approach the concept of people like me. In the view of many people, if you live in a big city, have a stable income, are healthy etc then you *simply can't* have a problem meeting people unless you are acting in a way so counterproductive that you're sabotaging yourself.

This simple assertion has been a serious detriment to my self esteem. At points I've suspected my friends of lying to me by saying I'm doing nothing wrong, I've totally changed my look a few times out of sheer paranoia, and wasted money on all sorts of courses in the hope of finding the surely plainly obvious trick that I've been missing all my life. Surely, after all, if I'm decent, healthy, and available there can't be literally nobody in this huge city? 

Much of the advice given by friends is of course sincere, in good faith, and I really appreciate that they care enough to help. It does really seem to me, however, that people, they included can't or won't acknowledge that I can even exist conceptually. This sounds minor, maybe, but to me, and I know to other people in my position it isn't. The same people will say to others that if they have it together, and simply go to places to talk to the right people/share hobbies/ whatever else, then the problem, my exact problem, can't exist.

This sort of invalidation is not only a challenge personally, making me and people like me doubt my own sanity and ability to perceive myself or trust others' assessments of me, but I believe it leads to social issues too.

The empathy people are able to extend to many people struggling in situations like mine is so low, because it's so much easier to just deny that people could ever be doing what they can, or tell them to wait 3 months ad nauseam, or to either start or stop online dating depending on if theyre currently using it or not. It also leads to toxic positivity loops, where when in doubt people use the fact that someone has asked for help as the reason that they have the problem they do.

I think, as simple as it sounds, if we were more willing and able socially to accept that sometimes people can just be stuck, for very long periods of time, without rhyme or reason, and that those people weren't lesser people for it, we'd really have taken a big step towards making the dating landscape more healthy and less toxic.

Shortly after college started, I met someone else and ghosted the guy I met at the bonfire. Here’s the thing, he barely tried to get me back. Over the span of 2 weeks he only made 2 half ass attempts via text to work things out i think? (I ghosted both attempts) and then after that, he completely disappeared. He didn’t showed any type of emotion. 

I would throw my new man in his face on Snapchat story, but he not once ever viewed the story, even though I would view his at literally the last minute every time.

A guy I’ve been talking to for a while finally got done with some training and has been back in town the last few weeks. For the entire time he was away, we talked everyday, flirted a lot, and discussed plans to meet up and hang out casually (dinner and drinks kinda thing). The first weekend he was back, he asked if I wanted to go to dinner one night and I agreed. All week he was talking about dinner plans and how excited he was to meet me finally. 

Saturday night comes around, and I don’t hear from him. At all. Until Sunday morning. I had gotten dressed up and ready for dinner for the time we agreed on, and I don’t even get a cancel text. I get a “sorry something came up” text the next morning. I was pissed but gave him the benefit of the doubt. 

A couple weeks later, he asks me to do dinner again. I agree but we didn’t set a time. I get a text around 4 today saying he has something goin on at the moment but will text me in a bit. I never hear from him. It’s now 8:30 and I realize it’s never going to happen. 

Why do people do this? It hurts. This isn’t the first time this has happened to me either. I’m new to dating as I got divorced from a 10 year marriage last year. So far it’s been horrible and makes me really sad that there isn’t a man out there that really gives a damn about how their actions affect the women they talk to. I know this doesn’t only apply to men either, all people can be shitty. 

But good god. Why don’t people have the decency to just cancel? Or tell them the truth? I’m sitting here self conscious like I did something or I’m not good enough to be taken out legitimately. I deleted all my dating apps because this is just making me feel worse and worse about myself and my apparent horrible taste in men. 

I don’t know what to do to prevent this from happening besides not dating anymore.

One thing ive noticed is that she seems to be making excuses whether that is she was sleeping early or she's talking with her friends etc. I tell myself it is just the inconvenience of catching her at the wrong time. I think it is also strange that ive noticed our conversations die down and she really started to lag a lot when trying to text her. She definitely was very much responsive when i first started talking to her. I don't know if im starting to see how she really is, but im confused on what to do. I know that people are not obligated to text you right away. I totally get that and I do the same. However, I want to put in the effort to talk to her more, it's just she does not reciprocate the same energy. thats why ive been trying to schedule a facetime call because i know verbal communication is how she likes to communicate. Last thursday i asked if she wanted to facetime (i also wanted to tell her that i deleted hinge so that she knows i wouldnt be talking to anyone else) and completely ignored me the whole day. I was going to bed and texted her that i understand she's probably busy, and that she should just reach out to me because i wanted to plan a date with her. She left me on read for 3 days and that had me thinking if she was still interested, especially since she wasn't really texting me or willing to facetime. She finally responded saying that she was busy/had bad days at work, and was going to sleep early. But then she also told me that she felt overwhelmed and that i was moving fast, and she told me she wanted to take her next relationship slow. I just dont know what she means by slow, and i responded apologizing for making her feel that way. I also mentioned that i didnt feel like the energy was reciprocated, and that im trying to respect her feelings and how overwhelming work is going for her. I even told her that there is a miscommunication between us, and that if she was willing to elaborate more with her situations and feelings that i would give her the space she needed and would not be planning out the next date i want to take her to. Again, I know people aren't obligated to text anyone or update anyone, but it would make it a hell of a lot easier to understand whats going on. I felt that i over texted with paragraphs and ive only known her for a short period of time. I know for a fact she feels overwhelmed by that too, and in all honesty i just want to make sure there is no miscommunication on how we communicate with each other.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1160300,public,self,Talking to a girl who doesn't give me the time of day,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sxiw5y/talking_to_a_girl_who_doesnt_give_me_the_time_of/,no_ads,0,,,

I tried dating apps, after tinder and bumble failed I tried Hinge, after being ghosted numerous times I landed a date, she didn't show up and never talked to me again. Getting stood up is actually more common for me than actually going on the stupid date. 

I work second shift full time so finding hobbies is a bit difficult, on top of that I am not naturally social, I tend to be a bit awkward in conversations. That being said even when I do talk to girls who would be fine with that, I am almost universally ghosted. 

I am not a bad looking guy, granted I am 5 ft 7, I am not overweigh and am reasonably fit, I am 27, people tell me often that I am smart and funny, that I just need to keep looking or stop looking or wait for the right person and on and on.

I can't keep doing this to myself, every time this happens it just hurts worse and worse, I am honestly and very seriously considering just giving up for good, as I know myself well enough to know that if I do quit, I don't go back, I won't be able to talk myself into it.

No, I’m at a stage where Imm truly broken, and don’t know what to do. 

I’m not making this post to vent, or seak attention, I truly need help, because even myself am lost. 

I’ve always been socially awkward, always anxious, I barely had any friends. I’ve always felt the need to have someone close to me since middle school, but at that time it was pretty basic and harmless. I didn’t fear rejection, yeah, it sucked, but it was bearable. I was the guy that never stopped trying to date someone, once I found a girl that would simply be nice back towards me, I would try everything to get closer, but truly never had success, the furthest I’ve gone with a girl, is she agreed to hangout, but finally we never actually did. So no dates, no holding hands, no kissing, not even hanging out of classes. 

Now I’m in paramedic school, its a very intense program where I live, 60h/week just of school, I had to move out my parents and move out far, over 600km. So new start I told myself, but no suprised, it just repeated itself, gradually hurting more everytime I noticed I failed. A few weeks ago was my last failure, it hurted a lot, it was the first time a girl dhowed interest only to get insanely distant a couple days later, don’t ask me why, I don’t know either. Since then I never truly recovered, I always have negative feeling when dating comes through my mind, everytime on social medias I see a couple, I get insanely mad, pissed, and start requestioning my existence. Its a huge problem. And I’m scared that it not only affects my dating life, but my studies, and other aspects of my life. I always want to start trying again, but I won’t be able to handle losing once more, I’m worried that if it get worst, it might have permanent damages. You could be wondering why I absolutly want to have a girlfriend, well, for me I always had to be important to someone, I want to be special to someone, but I’m usually the friend that gets left behind, I’m not the funirst, the prettiest, the smartest, but I do love myself, but I can’t make someone else love me, and thats what is hurting me so bad, to a pount where I developed an unhealthy livestyle, of blaming myself for everything. What can I do to help? Were any of you in a similar situation? How can I get out of this? Your help is very much appreciated.

we met in a friend group, she came on to me very strong,admitted feelings first

things were going good but i and friends found it was walking on eggshells with her sometimes

before our first date she says shes emotionally unavailable and cant promise a relationship, i like her so i decide whatever ill be patient,give space etc but im trying not to get too attached because i might get hurt. she continued to i guess love bomb?

said im the fastest she ever became intimate with before that im perfect etc. 

fast forward, she loses a bunch of friends..sad for a bit. day before i stay over for the first time she says she thinks shes non monogamous but only wants to see me right now and stuff. im shocked hurt and confused. i accept it but not sure what i can and cant do nor say and how to adjust.

the day i stay over, says she doesnt trust me yet and that i know nothing about her.  later on that i dont seem present with her and to open up to her, i seem always anxious. double standard eh? we end up having sex and she says how happy she is with me and that im perfect. 

i recently stayed over again and shes ovulating saying shes horny all week, i was starting to feel used tbh. 
we see each other again but im still unsure of things and just trying to make her comfortable/not pushing anything. although we do everything a relationship does. 

again she says i dont seem present and there with her. that im somewhere else.  and constantly anxious…i said im fine and just want to make sure shes comfortable etc. i even got her flowers and didnt know if i should of or not. although she liked them

in my mind im just scared of getting too close and being hurt, saying/doing the wrong things and adjusting to everything. its all new to me. :/ 

we end up having sex twice and i pleasure 
her multiple times, she says how well i do, that im perfect, shes so happy with me and she trusts me. 

few days later a lot happens with her house and stuff, shes anxious  plus getting her period.
i give her space then we were talking etc..says shes thinking about asking me for some time i asked details, she said shes unsure of her feelings that she doesnt feel we have connected lately. she was going to wait for batman to tell me but didnt want to pretend for weeks. 

we talk the next morning and says she doesnt want to continue romantically, that i never seem present or open with her, we are different,i dont try and she makes too much effort for me. that she doesnt seem seen or understood etc. 

i told her im sorry, that ive never been told i was not being  present and stuff. she asked then why with her, whats different? angrily. but i didnt respond, i blanked out. 

i was upset and just took the blame for everything and feel terrible. 

we are going to see each other again for batman  and discuss things and im going to tell her the reasons why i was like that.  
its not fair :(. also after she pulled me in i guess she got comfortable and i was always the one making plans, contacting her, being patient and giving space etc. 

shes been abused in the past and stuff. but for her to just kind of throw me away hurts. she even says she keeps and gives the wrong people chances in her life. 
i miss her and admittedly i was starting to let my guard down. i cant help but feel its all my fault. 

sigh. any input is greatly appreciated. thank you if you read this long ass post

We hit it off about a month ago. We have so much in common. We talk all day. We’ve had about 6 dates so far. 

She established to me early she’s very sensitive to commitment and has some walls regarding physical touch. No problem. I like her, want her to feel safe, and when the time comes to do those things, we will.

This weekend, she came over Friday, and we touched for the first time…like a handhold, basic stuff. It meant a lot to me. The walls were down a bit and she’s a bit more comfortable. Awesome. I’m really happy. I don’t love her yet, I’m not asking for marriage, but I feel good where this can go.

She comes back Saturday. She’s very cuddly, we hang out at night and have our first kiss on my couch. We’re up all night making out, being close. It feels really good. She does tell me she’s been going on other dates with men as well. I’m candid with her, and tell her the significance of these things to me, and ask maybe if we can be exclusive. She’s very worried about commitment. She says other guys have been nice to her for the same time I have and she’s been bit for it. She’s not super trusting. I empathize. We don’t need labels, I’m fine waiting. But with how I feel, I’d just rather not worry about being in a competition. We hang out a lot, talk all day, she says she likes me. Whatever. So she says okay. No more Hinge dates. She’ll break it off with a couple
guys.

Also of note is during this time she talks a lot about exes, how she dislikes men, she fools around a lot with me by joking about talking to other guys or whatever. It’s playful, I have thick skin. But it can wear on me when it’s some default banter. Then when I play along and make up some fictitious Hinge person, she even admits she feels she would be jealous if I had another girl over and we did the things we did. I’m not though, I paused all my apps (not that I’m asking for anything - that was my decision) because this is the person I want to focus on. 

The next day, she forgets some stuff, and stops by after work to get it. We hang a little more. One guy from Hinge is still texting her. Asking her about a date or whatever. She hasn’t broke it off. She says she doesn’t know how and feels bad doing so because she doesn’t want to hurt feelings. I’m getting a little insecure I guess. We just spoke about this last night. So I ask her again if she’s sure she wants this and I feel bad if I’m taking away dating or asking her to lose something. She kind of shuts down. Goes to sleep (still
here asleep). She has mild autism so I think maybe it was an overload to ask again. But I’m confused. 

It’s just - our time together has meant a lot. She says she feels the same. She was really into kissing me the other night. She said as much. That’s a big step for me, as lame as it sounds. Again though, she jokes about sex and other partners a lot. She says I’m a great kisser and she wishes she “felt this comfortable” with all people so she could be more into hookup culture where she doesn’t have to worry about commitment. She’s joking. She says she’s joking. This is kind of the sense of humor - to get a rise out of me a bit in a playful way. But it sinks into my mind. And I’m like “are you sure you’re okay being exclusive and want what I do?” And she says yes.

Again, I like her. She’s never had a longer relationship. She’s great and I think there’s potential. But, I don’t think I’m totally unreasonable and I’m having trouble trusting because all of the jokes. And I know it’s not just me - she jokes this way with people. But, now we’re a month in and she kissed me first and often, and she has let these walls down….that’s a Cue to me that she feels good about me and wants to keep moving. The fact there’s still other men after that just confuses me. And with commitment, all I asked right away was maybe stop dating, but we don’t have to be bf/gf because it’s early. That’s fine. But the thought of her with others as we make these steps upsets me a little. 

And then tonight just…ugh. I feel awful. She’s passed out on my couch, maybe I pressed a little. Not In an aggressive way but I feel more need for reassurance from her that she didn’t give. I still feel bad. I just don’t want this to end when it may have potential. My heart just kind of hurts. I felt bad about the shutdown and maybe I said too much or drained her, but I also think I have needs too and this flip flopping would cease a bit.

Anytime he does I’ve noticed he doesn’t tip. Like I’ve never seen him tip. At first I thought maybe he was paying it on card, but he’s definitely not.

Today after going shopping together out of town he offered to take me to lunch on his treat. I didn’t have any cash on me so I immediately thought to say no. Leaving no tip really does bother me that bad. I’ve told him as much. I still went to lunch. I wanted to be a good sport. But yet again when the bill came no tip. I pointed out that I didn’t have cash. He said the same, but didn’t write any kind of tip on the check. He could have rounded for a perfect 15% too. 

It just makes me always want to split with him. Or not go out to dinner. I’ll always be covering tip. I don’t tend to carry cash on me at all and I’ve gotten into the habit just to cover the tip if we go out. 

Is it petty to stop seeing him because he doesn’t tip?

On mobile so sorry for an formatting issues.

So basically what the title says, in Nov i matched with someone on Tinder, super hot and amazing, great at covos and just an interesting person in general. I was honestly in disbelief like holy shit this person is actually interested in me, giving me attention and was in constant contact with me on an everyday basis.

We went on 3 dates total, one was to an arcade and dinner, next was an amazing art museum and the last was to the movies. I was upfront with them about my personality, im awkward and mega introvert but it worked great since they were exactly the same and even better, they were taking things slow with me which was exactly what i needed. I was on cloud 9.

But then the holidays came and i got covid so we hadn't see each other in about 2 months but we were still in constant contact, even if it was just 2 messages a day. We were planning on seeing each other again this weekend after V-day since i get paid and they would be completely vaccinated (should mention, im fully vaxed, and on our dates we were taking precautions, masks and all)

Then suddenly they stopped opening my messages, we mostly communicate on snap so like im able to see if they opened it. At first i thought oh they're just busy, I'll just wait. Well 1 day turned to 2, then 3 and so on and i thought oh maybe they just dont see it/not on snap often right now and thats what you would think as well, right? But they're still posting on snap about playing video games and being at the gym on their story, they've even been watching my story but still nothing.

So this person is now actively ignoring me and just decided they were done and im just here wondering wtf did i do? Did i say something? Am i coming off as boring? I have no fucking clue and it hurts sooooo fucking much because i thought we actually had a connection and now they just dropped me like when Andy didnt wanna play with Woody anymore.

I'm just tired of this, like is it really hard to just say you're not interested anymore? Fuck it hurts more to be ghosted then saying ""hey this was fun, but I'm just not interested."" Sadly i know a lot of people would relate to this and i just wish it was different and more people took the mature route and actually voiced how they were feeling. :/
