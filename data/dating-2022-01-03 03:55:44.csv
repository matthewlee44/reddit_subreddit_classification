0,ruyfsi,1641204718,WHY is it that the person we want the most is usually bad for us but the person we don't want would probably be good for us?,"I have found this a puzzling and inevitable phenomenon about human beings that anytime a man or woman comes across what they see/hear/know as **good** they want them less. When we hear/see/know they might be **bad** then we justify what we want regardless of other's *warnings* *and insight* and try to prove the world wrong. By **good** I do mean that 'nice' or 'sweet' person that isn't what you would initially prefer in a partner based off whatever personal reason but you know...the ones your parents and friends LOVE. By **bad** I do mean that 'risky' or 'dangerous' person you know you want because initially you just 'know' but and can't figure out why but you know...the ones your parents HATE but friends may question.

For example - I can run into a woman who I think is good or great in my eyes, despite their imperfections or flaws because that's what makes them 'them'. (Blinded by love? Puppy dog love?)

\- I can come across another woman who has great positive qualities that I like and can relate to( not drinking or not a fan of tattoos or likes to read)...but then they have kids from another relationship.(Picky maybe?)

\- I can meet a woman who I know instantly there is that instant 'type' attraction but deep down that it will be nothing but the physical/lust. ( Jumping too soon to conclusion?)

Let's be honest, doesn't it almost always go back to the sex factor? Everything other than it or everything about it, it all goes back to it. Be it our personal preference, that inner gut voice, or bio-sub-instinctive truth of what we feel would be best for us to mate with( pleasure/healthiest children/etc.)

I won't clump every person in the same category because not every man or woman intentionally goes after and continues to be with someone who is **bad** for them. Some know their worth more than others and walk away from what benefits them not. Some learn their lesson after a **bad** partnership. Some experience a **good** partnership and it ends for said reasons. Sometimes maybe what may be **bad** in others eyes actually is **good** for us, to us, with us? Maybe deep down those guys and gals aren't so good themselves ;)

As I write this I also think it might just have to do with *not being willing to take a chance on someone or something that does not fit into our subconscious or biased frame of mind what we think is attractive or best for us. Aka 'Our Type'*

1,ruygij,1641204792,Should I text him?,"I met this one guy at the language exchange group. He posted about learning my native language and offered his native. Since my level is like b1/b2 it's already conversational.
I messaged him that I already have some materials because I used to teach my other friends. Basically, he agreed and we met.
And it was awesome. Never in my life have I seen anyone more charming than him. We studied a bit then we decided to talk just about us. When we left, he texted me 2 hours later that he enjoyed it a lot. But then he didn't text me for 2 weeks and I didn't care either. Before Christmas he casually texted me if we're going to meet or nope. I agreed and it was at his place this time. And same thing, we talked for hours I really enjoyed it. But then we started kissing and he proceeded to touch me here and there which I'm not comfortable with because of my insecurities. He apologized and I couldn't really notice that he cared much. We talked, left and no messages till then. The following day I told him that I really enjoyed the meeting  so he agreed saying it was very nice. I waited one day thinking that maybe he'd suggest something. Then wished him happy new year and since then, he still hasn't read my message.
Here's the question. Should I text him? Suggesting some meeting or asking if everything's alright? We never talked much on social media as he stated he's not very active there. Are there any red flags that I've missed and he just wanted a normal hook-up? I rarely get charmed as I've always been a cold person and couldn't really express my feelings. But I think that this guy ""might"" be different.

3,ruyim3,1641205022,What was I feeling in this encounter?,"I'm a 30 year old male who has never been in a relationship. Barely been kissed. I certainly don't know what a crush or infatuation was. 

Yes I am asking what a crush feels like. 

A few months ago I was on a trail where I encountered a park interpreter just walking up the trail. She was walking up a hill at me, I hadn't made eye contact yet because she was looking behind her, and I felt like a significantly enhanced feeling of admiration of her. This is before I literally even see her face. 

As she comes up I have a heightened interest in looking at her face, eyes, skin, hair, and needing to notice it. There's absolutely no reason for this. There's almost very light woozy sensation with in my mind. It's a little bit like brain fog, but not the same. 

None of this is lustful at all. It just stands out to me more and her presence is a more visible for some reason. All she does is say hello and tell me they are closing in a few minutes. That's it and walks up the trail. 

I know she's a park ranger, interpreter which I've encountered many times (hundreds actually) with no different feeling. For some reason in this ten minute experience I find that very admirable she does this for a living and I wouldn't mind talking to her more and getting to know her, like more than a friend. 

All of this almost instantaneous and sporadic. It just came upon me for absolutely no reason. It wasn't just like running into an average person or another girl. I've encountered many young and female rangers like this. It's never happened before or sense. Several months later it does stand out however. 

What was this encounter I was having? I don't know what this was or how to explain it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ruyim3/what_was_i_feeling_in_this_encounter/

Personal Conclusion:

5,ruytps,1641206222,"I just want a chance, man.","I hate how as a man, just getting your foot in the door is so hard. Like, I’m not talking about getting a girlfriend, or finding a date, or even a conversation, I just mean literally getting a match somewhere. 

I’ve tried my absolute hardest to make my dating profiles reflect the best parts of me. My pictures are nice, my bio and prompts are funny and are a good reflection of who I am in person. I try to be open minded and swipe right on girls who I’m not necessarily attracted to but who seem fun or interesting. I use all my likes whenever I go on these apps so my chances are maximised. 

And what do I have to show for it? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I haven’t had a match in over a month. I’m not entitled to matches, I know, but just something to show this isn’t completely hopeless would be so good. 

I’m not mad at women for this. That’s absolutely not the angle I’m getting at. I just hate how the dating pool is so flooded with men that most women can match with no problem, that for a large percentage of us, we’re simply too average and normal to stand out. There’s no reason a girl should match with me when she can just keep going and find someone more interesting, more attractive, etc, in just a few swipes. That’s not to say I’m not attractive or interesting, just that it’s not enough when compared to other guys that women are also more or less guaranteed to match with.

Girl 2: First date went well. She claimed she really enjoyed it and liked me. When trying to organise second date she was always busy, but she still said she wanted to see me. About a month later we went on second date. It went well but she is saying again she is super busy.


Girl 3: Went on one date, went ok but was clear she was very shy. We’ve spoken about meeting again, but it is always me initiating the conversation.


Girl 4: went on date, went really well. Spoke for like 3 weeks over text, which involved plans for meeting again but nothing happened. She started to be flakey, so we stopped talking. Couple weeks later she messaged me and we said we should meet again but nothing has happened. Felt like I was the one suggesting dates and she would always be busy.

I have essential tremor, which means my hands, and sometimes other body parts, shake rhythmically when I move them to quite a severe degree. I went on a date where the guy stared into his lap the entire time while we were drinking and eating. We're in our 30s.

I had no idea what was going on, but then he suddenly turned around without making eye contact, started making out with me, and initiated intimacy. This happened for two dates. I assumed he wasn't interested in building a relationship, but then he called to ask me on a third date.

I asked him why he couldn't make eye contact and he said it was because he was uncomfortable, and he didn't want to make me uncomfortable eating and drinking with my tremor. He said he didn't know where to look or how to help me.

I teared up. He said he did like me, and he thought that if we kept casually dating, he may be able to overcome his comfort, so we planned a third date. He then cancelled it because he was uncomfortable with how he had made me feel and didn't want to be in ""relationship repair mode"" already. Funnily enough, he had no problem instigating intimacy.

Others on Reddit have said it's quite normal for someone not to make eye contact when they're uncomfortable around someone who has a disability, but does this still apply when he initiated intimacy? Also, it's just a tremor, not a huge growth on my face or something like that. It just seems weird to me.

I met this girl about 5 months ago. We treated each other really well even tho we weren't in a relationship, she cooked for me, bought a whole bunch of gifts for me on my birthday, told me she has feelings for me and wanted me in her life for a very long time, talked to me on the phone every single night til she fell asleep, then all of a sudden in one month she starts acting distant, just to tell me a few days ago that we don't have a future together and that she'd never see me that way... basically she lost feelings for me quickly after all that... We've never had a problem, argument or anything but this is how she feels. I asked her about it and she told me she's done the same thing in the past with other guys because she's an ""emotional girl"" and she develops feelings too quickly. Now she wants to just be friends and claims that she ""cares about me a lot"" and still wants to hang out with me. The thing is I feel like I want to help her rediscover those feelings, I'm not gonna go my whole life trying to do it, but maybe there's hope?

I’m 25 and every guy I date say they are on the fence about having kids. All my guy mates are unsure about wanting kids too. 

Therefore I’ve never had a boyfriend as I ask this very early on in dating and they always say ‘at this point in my life I’m not sure, not right now or even I’m not too sure but would be nice to have more money to go on holiday.’

The current guy I am dating (26 M) says that his best mate had a baby lately and it made him think that maybe a kid isn’t a best idea. He said if you ask him now he would say no but in a few years after he has travelled he doesn’t know how he feels. 

I don’t know if this is a common thing for men in their 20s to feel. I don’t want kids until Im in my 30s, so maybe 8-10 years from now. But I know I would like them one day. I overthink things and think what if my partner died and I had no family left, it would be rather lonely not having children.

He treated me good and made me feel so special. All in all I really think I might’ve found “the one”. He was also sending me memes like “when you found the one” so I really thought something of it. I don’t have chemistry with a whole lot of men usually so being with him and actually liked him made me fall hard, really hard. He also doesn’t live in the same city as me so he said it would be unrealistic to date which I can understand and said that he needs to value getting his shit together (since he’s turning 30) and that I wouldn’t be a priority… nobody would. I honestly just unfollowed him on all social media because I can’t partake in this or even just simply being friends with him because it hurts my self worth/esteem — it actually stings. I feel so stupid for thinking this could ever be anything and he’s basically told me on the phone last night that it was obvious that he didn’t want anything serious essentially. Every single time I am vulnerable with someone they end up throwing it in my face and breaking my heart and I don’t know how many heartbreaks I can endure. 

When I met him I was pretty stone cold and not looking to date to protect myself. I know he knows we have a special relationship despite living thousands of miles away. He told me that while I’m s beautiful “nice girl” and one of the people in his life that he had love. I have no peace about this friendship/relationship whatever the hell we had. I am appreciative of the life advice he’s given me in the two months I’ve known him but talking to him every day and knowing how he feels just hurts me.

We did have sex a few times, but we also snuggled a lot and watched tv. He kept squeezing me a lot while we cuddled and he gave me back tickles in the morning and pulled me into him. I also caught him looking and smiling at me a few times. He also checked I got home okay after I left.

Now I'm a bit confused cause to me those are things a guy does when he likes you, but I totally thought he just wanted to hook up. Obviously we only met 2 days ago so I'm not thinking he has a proper crush on me, but still just wondering about it.

We we’re watching a movie and the lead was debating if she could make it work with her boyfriend since he was not the best lover she’s had. My girlfriend then mentioned that it was ridiculous and that no woman would ever choose mind blowing sex over a good partner. If she had left it at that I wouldn’t feel the way I do but she then said, “If I did that I’d have ended up with a manipulative woman beater.” 

Which I felt something she didn’t need to say. I had never thought about this before and it wasn’t something I ever needed to know. I was happy being ignorant. 

I told her how what she said made me feel. And she did not try to make me feel better. She told me that she doesn’t need great sex to be in an amazing relationship which made me feel even worse.

I don’t know if I should talk to her about it any more because I don’t see her not making me feel somehow even worse about this. I’m kinda worried that if she hasn’t forgotten the guy that was better, she might be thinking about him and sex with him a lot.

76,rv8ahj,1641234270,Girl I've been texting with for a month blocked me out of nowhere," We've met on Tinder and have been texting on a daily basis for a month. Long, elaborate letters via WhatsApp, quick exchanges, voice mails, jokes/memes, the whole nine yards. We got along great pretty much instantly.

To give context: She suffers from depression and has a lot of stressful shit going on in her life right now, but would always respond to my texts. Sometimes to vent, asking me for advice or just to joke around/flirt. She said it calms and centers her. The ""letters"", that I received from her the last 2 days sounded very absent-minded and ""matter-of-fact"". The messages were full of conversational cul-de-sacs like ""haha, that happens sometimes"", ""I can't explain that right now"" or ""I don't know"", which was rather unusual of her. I had no clue how to respond to that. The weeks before, we had an amazing dynamic. We never ran out of things to write and there was genuine interest on both sides.

So I carefully addressed it in an voice mail. I was upfront, but remained respectful and diplomatic in my tone and assured her that everything's fine and she didn't do anything wrong. I suggested that we should stick to shorter messages for the time being, since it seems to be a little to much for her at the moment and I didn't want to be an additional burden to her. She said that I was right and that she is falling deeper into the ""conversation void"", further withdrawing and not wanting to write or interact with others too much. She appreciated my honesty and didn't take it the wrong way. We ended on a positive note, joked and flirted for a bit. ""See you tomorrow"" was the last thing she wrote.

Yesterday, I wished her a good time at her friends' new years eve get-together, joked about probably getting drunk texts from her (we were both in on the joke) and after 7 hours of no responses asked if she was ok (I was getting a little concerned). She then blocked me around midnight on WhatsApp, unmatched me on Tinder and can't be reached via phone call.

The whole day I'm trying to rack my brain around what could possibly have happened, but it just doesn't make sense to me. She just doesn't seem like the type to just ghost someone like that, especially since I was understanding of her issues and never pushed or pressured her into anything (something she said she liked and appreciated a lot). This behavior just doesn't seem to make sense and seems so unlike her. But then again, I've only known her for a month, so...

I'm not sure if I'm doing anything wrong, or if I just haven't met the right guy. In all of these cases, I haven't been particular upset or heartbroken about parting ways. I usually have enjoyed these men's company, but am somewhat indifferent about not seeing them again. And I've been trying not to cut someone off too soon just because I don't feel a spark. It doesn't feel like I've particularly ""clicked"" with anyone right away so far, but I'm also worried, maybe I'm appearing too awkward or not interested enough right away - but I also don't want to come on too strong if I don't really feel that way, or emotionally invest in someone way too soon. I can't figure out if and when I meet the right person, I'll be really excited to keep seeing them after a date or two, and that just hasn't happened yet, or if I'm awkward and putting up a wall and pushing any chance of a connection away?

My bf and I have been trying to get his son (toddler) to get more comfortable with me over the past 2 years and has been going well but every now and then he gets in his set “I hate this lady” moods. This past weekend, he got to our house and was very clearly grumpy. While he took a nap me and my bf had come up with a game plan. I’ll ask if he wants to help me give our dogs a bath (he loves helping and baths so I thought it would be a good activity to do together) but as soon as he was up my bf asked his kid if he wants to help dad bathe the dogs. He happily said okay and my bf mouthed “sorry” and I still ended up bathing the dogs, just not with his son. I was annoyed about this but got over it. Next day, his son was grumpy and saying this like “I hate you” “go away, I don’t want you to sit on the couch” “I don’t want you to watch this show with me” “my house not yours (I pay rent..)” I tried to get him to calm down myself but at that moment I was the devil to him so I went to my bf who was on his phone in the kitchen for help. My bf goes up to him and asks “are you being nice?” The kid says yes. I’m going to my room to play now. Bf says ok have fun. I explained to him that I didn’t like how he went about that and I felt like he was reinforcing the behavior of saying whatever he wants to me. He got upset and said that he didn’t feel that way at all about how he said it and that I’m overreacting. Next day (his son going back to his moms for the week) got home from work and his son greeted me happily. Had great conversation and time but asked why he wasn’t wearing the sweater I got him for Christmas. His dad jumps in and says if I send him with that I’m never gonna get it back from his moms. I get it but I had explained to him how excited I was about his sweater and showing it off and his mom was totally on board too! But his dad wanted him to wear it at our house. I asked if he is embarrassed of me getting him that or if his mom is gonna have an issue with it or what. He explained it wasn’t anything like that but it still definitely came off that way.

The last date I was on asked me how I felt about Zodiac signs after I think she picked up on a little of my discomfort when she kept bringing it up and *I thiiiink* I handled it relatively gracefully. 

I tried to relate Zodiac signs to an explanation of Tarot cards someone once told me. That Tarot cards don't *tell the future* or whatever but that the cards can be used as prompts for telling a story. Playing Tarot is an act of collaborative story-telling where you *discover* what happens next together - not a mystical process with supernatural powers. As a skeptic it was a way I could understand and accept Tarot as a kind of proto-Dungeons and Dragons.

Because the brutal honest truth is that his star chart crap is some bronze age superstitions otherwise. 

Just surprised to see how common it is on profiles and matches. Is this new? Have I been trapped in my bubble of Male friendships too long to notice that women care about Zodiac signs?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rv9t8d/whats_the_deal_with_zodiac_signs/
