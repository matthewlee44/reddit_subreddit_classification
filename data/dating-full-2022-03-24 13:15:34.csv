Basically I (23F) have been dating my bf (22M) for around 3-4 months now. We've never had any big fights or anything (yet?), maybe just a few small misunderstandings but we both just communicated our thoughts and sorted it out. We always emphasize the importance of communicating.

So lately it's been really tough for me in terms of my life. I got covid, we had our weekend plans ruined from that, I'm not feeling very good with my symptoms and we talked about really missing each other. 

Today we were in a call and basically I was feeling very emotionally sad and lonely. He also told me his mum put some blame on me for getting covid which made him isolate but I'm not sure how serious his mum was about that and he didn't say much details about it. It did make me feel bad but I didn't want to overreact when it wasn't really confirmed. Anyway, my bf is the type that doesn't really express his emotional affection verbally and I have told him before it would be nice if he could &amp; he said he would try. I didn't see much of an improvement on that end so far but I didn't mind, I could wait and we could work on it.

But today I felt really sad and really just wanted any bit of comfort I could get. So I decided to ask him to try cheer me up instead of bottling it up to myself. He said it was a bit difficult to do with the current situation (COVID and through call I'm guessing). I eventually asked him to maybe try give me some words of affection and that it would make me feel a bit better. He went silent for a while. I said ""I'm guessing that's a no?"" and he said ""Yeah, it feels forced when you ask me to do it"". This whole time I felt like I was going to cry but held it in. I wanted just any sign that he was willing to try show some affection or cheer me up but I got nothing. I also understand he's struggles to show verbal affection but I guess this night in particular I was feeling very emotional and a bit needy. Even if he said ""Sorry I tried but I can't right now"" I would understand, but to me, the responses he gave did not indicate that he even wanted to try. I wanted to cry but not in front of him so I said I was tired, wanted to sleep and hung up. 

I was pretty upset and after the call, I received a message from him, it said things like how he is going through a hard time because of everything going on. And that he feels bad he couldn't comfort me or be with me and how he's stressed about a lot of things. I had no idea he felt this way because he never showed or told me anything. So immediately I felt worried and also felt very bad that I had tried to ""force"" him to cheer me up when he himself was not feeling the best. I wrote back about how I didn't realise, apologised if I made him more upset in any way, and explained my side of what I felt. 

And here is where I'm feeling a little confused. He didn't open my messages (he could've read them from notifications but chose not to open them) and is not responding me. I am not spamming him, because I understand sometimes you need some alone time. It's been a few hours now. Am I wrong to feel a little upset and alone that he decided to not respond or open them? I wanted to talk it out, communicate with him, help comfort him in any way possible but I'm guessing he does not feel the same? I want him to rely on me and we can rely on each other for comfort but this shows he doesn't. It really doesn't help that I feel very alone rn.

As an anxious person (he knows that as well), I can't help but think he's probably reconsidering our relationship, or that he doesn't want to deal with me right now. And I know how silly my thoughts can be, but I can't think of any other reason as to why one would ghost the other if you truly cared about them. Like even a simple message like ""Sorry I'm feeling a lot right now, I need some alone time and will respond to you later"" would be good.

I‚Äôm not very experienced with dating (I grew up in a hardcore fundie cult and I have basically been focused on escaping and starting a new life in my early twenties), but I know how to turn on the charm and be extremely pleasant. I recently met up with a guy (M26) from the apps. We had good conversation and early on he asked me for coffee. We had a frankly wonderful date and the conversation flowed easily. The date ended up going on for five hours as we walked around the city talking about everything and he said he did not want the date to end, but he was respectful and gentlemanly. I gave him a kiss on the cheek after he walked me to my building.
 
Over the next couple days he texted me in the evenings after work, asking me if I wanted to go out again that night. I usually said no because by the time he texted me (6 or 7 pm), I was already dressed-down and not mentally ready to do anything after a long day of work. I told him I needed at least a day‚Äôs notice to do anything. A part of me felt uncomfortable with his eagerness to see me, especially to see me in more private locations. Yes, we had a lovely date, but a part of me is wary of men who show too much interest.
 
Part of it might be a trauma response. When I was 18 (and still in the cult), I had an older guy (26 at the time) who became obsessed with me and was absolutely convinced that God had chosen me to be his wife. Looking back on it, he was kind of a classic ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù who only wanted me because I was ‚Äúyoung and submissive.‚Äù I resisted his courtship (despite a lot of pressure from my family saying it was a sin to say no to a godly man) and he proceeded to stalk me for several years hoping to wear me down. I told him I wasn‚Äôt interested and didn‚Äôt want to be with him multiple times, but I was also being told by church leadership that I was a horrible person full of selfishness and entitlement for not wanting to marry him, and that no one else would ever want me. I still avoided the relationship and eventually got out of the cult, but for many years that ‚Äúpseudo relationship‚Äù was the only dating experience I ever had.
 
I want to date and have the experiences I missed out on during my adolescence and early twenties trapped in a cult, but dating as a ‚Äúsecular‚Äù adult is very foreign to me. I look very successful and accomplished on the outside, with a good education, professional degree, and the start of a good career. I‚Äôm relatively conventionally attractive and put-together. I‚Äôm a good conversationalist and most people like me, even if I have few close friends because I can be very distant and hard to really get to know. Deep down I feel so insecure and unworldly. So far in my secular life, I have avoided danger and trouble by keeping a low profile and focusing on school and work. I fiercely value my independence, but sometimes I know I can just be plain avoidant. A deep, repressed part of me wants love, companionship, romance, and excitement, but another part is so scared of taking risks. I‚Äôm especially scared of being trapped again, or being manipulated. I spent my whole life being manipulated and controlled, the last thing I want is to let a man manipulate or control me now that I‚Äôm free.
 
But I also don‚Äôt want to rob myself of love and new experiences because something feels foreign to me. I do like this guy and I‚Äôd like to know him better, but I‚Äôm not very sure about how dating goes after two people really click.

We met at her work last February and hit it off quite well, she gave me her number a couple hours in and we hung out literally that night at my place. We were both heavy stoners at the time so we smoked a decent bit (she actually out smoked me which was a huge turn on for me) and I felt bold so I leaned in for a kiss. She leaned in too, but I hesitated so we just touched foreheads, to which she said ‚Äúwe should just wait.‚Äù  

Sweet so I‚Äôm thinking I can finally wow this girl into maybe dating me. So a couple weeks go by, I make sure not to make any physical contact (she does lightly with hand touching etc), we literally spend hours talking in person and on the phone, sometimes till 4 am. At this point I think it‚Äôs time we can transition into a stage of talking since we‚Äôve gotten to know each other better and she declines stating she just got out of a relationship of 4 years and her grandparent just passed. I understand that, I lost my grandmother recently at the time as well so I moved on as if nothing happened. 

We continue to get along great, she‚Äôs extremely active in sports and extroverted like me, everything is perfect. We had our first kiss about 3 weeks in and had sex even a week after that. Thus I begin to think things are picking up even more, so I ask again if we can start talking/dating, she declines again. Now I‚Äôm starting to question this more and wondering why I‚Äôm investing money in buying things for her and time most of all. But nonetheless I continue on. 

It‚Äôs worth mentioning that I also drove a pretty shitty car and her ‚Äúthing‚Äù was dudes that drove nice cars. Anyway, time passes and it‚Äôs about 2 months into our fling and she‚Äôs sick so I go take her meds and help her clean around the house etc. She takes a bath and we‚Äôre talking about our stance with each other and she still feels like she isn‚Äôt ready (it‚Äôs been 6 months since the break up) and declines to date again. I decide enough is enough and I gave up.

Ive been seeing a Ukrainian girl (10 years younger than me) for over 3 months now and we have this insane chemistry when we are together, like i've never experienced. We have been magnetically attracted to each other since we met and our smells drive us crazy (we get high on phermones), we vibe really well when we hang out and like similar activities, have fun dates and not to mention the sex is awesome. The girl is obviously into me- the problem is, she goes really cold when we are not together. We only meet once a week- twice on a full moon. Shes bad at texting- doesnt reply sometimes, kinda moody if i call her(though she insists on calls over texts), and if I insist on meeting up it seems to push her away. Ive tried being assertive (which I naturally am), but it kinda scares her off. Ive tried being patient and nice and give her space, but it doesn't get me much except making me wait and feel down. 

I know what you are thinking and no shes not seeing someone else, at least she has promised im the only one shes seeing- which I do believe. She has told me shes not good into giving into her emotions right away and says she does wanna see me but shes just busy alot and doesn't wanna loose her focus. But its been 3 months and it feels like its not going anywhere and its starting to hurt. When I try to talk about my feelings or us- she gets uncomfortable- but yet, when shes in my arms and spending time with me, she cant keep her hands off me and kisses me madly like shes in love and can spend a whole morning staring into my eyes (something someone not interested would not do).  I cant understand how once a week is enough for her, and Im falling for this girl but I want more.

For some context, this girl and I found each other on hinge. We hit it off immediately and set up a date the very next week. However, we did set up the next date and she cancelled it because she hurt her foot.

Up until recently we have always texted 24/7. We also have been texting good morning to each other as well. But now, it seems like she is not interested in me.

I know what you are thinking and no shes not seeing someone else, at least she has promised im the only one shes seeing- which I do believe. She has told me shes not good into giving into her emotions right away and says she does wanna see me but shes just busy alot and doesn't wanna loose her focus.

I have some feelings regarding asymptomatic HSV testing and whether or not its worth it, considering the social stigma. A women I was dating a while ago requested that I get STI tested before becoming intimate. We have since broke it off for other reasons, but I still think about this and decided I should go ahead with the testing for my own benefit anyways. We are still friends.

She pointed out to me that I need to request the Herpes test specifically, in addition to the standard STI panel. After researching this, I found that most STI testing panels DO NOT include Herpes (like she said), but also found that the CDC actually does not recommend testing for Herpes in if you are asymptomatic. I consulted with my doctor as well, and was advised the same. I further uncovered that the social stigma is way worse than the actual condition itself (no symptoms in the majority of people), and most people actually have a form of Herpes, either HV1 or HV2, both which can be spread to genitals. However, the unfortunate few that do get symptoms and have a confirmed test, are now morally obligated to disclose this to sexual partners and face the possible rejection, even though the sexual partners likely have it as well.

My internal conflict is whether or not to test for this. Should I feel guilty for following the CDC's and my doctor's advice to not test for Herpes without symptoms? Is this a huge deal-breaker? The selfish part of is saying ignorance is bliss, and it would be unfair unless EVERYONE was tested for this as part of their STI panels. I'm afraid of the social stigma and impact to my dating life, especially as a man.

Please be nice if I'm doing something wrong.   


So to start off, I am a 16 yr. Old Male from Texas, and I have a dilemma. I have only ever had one girlfriend, I've never had my first kiss, and I am a virgin btw.   


A while ago, around early November, I was talking to a girl, I'll call her J. We started talking more and more and on November 26th, I decided to tell her my feelings that I liked her. She told me she liked me but didn't want to date me as she was friends with my Ex.   
However, later that night we were hanging out in a mutual friend group of ours and when we put on a movie, she came, sat next to me, and cuddled up next to me. Later, again, I asked if things had changed because she had a falling out with my Ex(she's crazy).  So, we ended up going on a date on Valentine's day and we went ice skating and held hands. It was one of the best days of my life to just get to enjoy my time with her. I also am from a big family and I always listen to and remember everything people say to me usually. So, a long time ago (December) she showed me 3 James Avery Silver rings that she liked, so I remembered and got her the ring with a Heart in it and gave it to her on our date on Valentine's day. She was so happy and the look on her face almost made me cry. Ever since then, I've been good friends with her because she doesn't want to take our relationship any further as of now.   


I really really like J and I know she likes me too a lot, but she doesn't want to date.   


Then comes the other girl, I'll call her B. She lives in my neighborhood and I like her a lot. She is VERY pretty and I get along with her SO well. She's so funny and fun to be around. We have already gone on like 2 dates but we aren't official yet. She also is always wanting to kiss and be physical which I always say no to (I really do want to do that, but I also want my first kiss \[and S\*x\] to be special). We also get along so well and my chemistry with her is really well. I just get her. For example, we went to a restaurant a couple of days ago with me and my friends and she was sitting to my left. When she went to cross her legs, she was having trouble because the table we were sitting at was relatively low. When her leg was kinda stuck, I grabbed her leg and pulled it over my lap. Then I started just slowly rubbing her leg and she smiled at me and started rubbing my knee. I could \*not\* see myself doing that with J, at least not for a while. With B, I kinda just understand what she wants me to do without her having to say anything. She also does want to date but I'm not sure if I'm ready for that though.   


So with that said, here is my Dilemma.   


Who do I pursue? With J, I've been talking to her for a couple of months longer than B. However, B is ready to date and J is not ready.   
If I go for J, it may be a while because I don't know when she'll want to date but I also like her a lot.   
However, if I go for B, we can do whatever we want, whenever, \*and\* we have such good chemistry.   


Please help. LMK what you think. I am coming to you because all of my friends are biased because they all know either B or J.

I'm not exactly sure what I should be asking, but I think I need to vent about this crap. I'm a 25 years old male who has only been in one single serious relationship in his entire life.

 It lasted a total of 4 months when I was 20. I ended things with the girl because she proved to be seriously clingy and her way of showing attraction was simply smothering me with feel-good moments so that I could never get to actually know her properly. The entire thing was purely physical and left a very bad impression on me about how relationships are done these days. Long story short, her very last words before we broke up were: ""you'll never date another girl ever!"", and it kinda lasted with me ever since. I understand that these things are said by most girls when they feel bitter about a guy ending things, but it's really been 5 years since then, and I've never been with anyone since.

I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but I do know that for me, religion is a big no no. Girls who are fanatic about religion are all kinds of messed up IME. It doesn't help that I live in a country where religion is massively shoved down our throats since birth. That girl was non-religious, and that was what brought us together in the first place.

As for me, I'm currently a compsci + compE student, double-majoring. I do have some of the core needs that any guy should take care of: fitness, confidence, and dressing. What I do not have are a house, a big social circle, and a lot of time. My studies take up most of my time. The girls in my class are all super uppity about social status or into traditional marriage shit. I can't stand either. Moreover, I can't for the life of me find a way to meet new people in my town. It's literally been bad luck whenever I tried to do cold approach.

For standards, I really appreciate girls who have their shit together, are serious about building a future, and who are at least a 6/10. Are those big demands? I know using the whole /10 thing is a bit sexist, but it's important to discuss attraction. 

What I think might be holding me back is that I'm 5'7, a bit muscular for my size, and have no tolerance for playing the social game with big groups of people. It's simply not in me to fake interactions in order to meet someone. 

So, what should I do given all of that? Lower standards? Drop classes to have more time? Cold approach more? Every day passes with no prospect of meeting anyone, and I'm really tired of the endless grind with no one there to talk to, hang out with, or look forward to the next day(:",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164430,public,self,5 years and counting....,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tmr39h/5_years_and_counting/,no_ads,0.0,dating,,,,,

27F, been on and off the dating apps for years. I‚Äôve complained to my mother enough and she has always reassured me that I just haven‚Äôt found the right one, been hearing this since I was 21. I feel like I could have been in a relationship or at least ‚Äúdated‚Äù if I went for the guys that have pursued me. However, I got tired of the ones I didn‚Äôt like back approaching me and have decided to use bumble. I‚Äôve met up with two guys and didn‚Äôt feel them either. It‚Äôs only been twice BUT like I said I tried the other apps for years. My life has always been the ones I want don‚Äôt want me back/aren‚Äôt serious and the ones that like me I don‚Äôt want back. My mom says that she really loved my dad and she‚Äôs been with her current boyfriend for years but I just don‚Äôt get the appeal of either of them (seeing them as if I don‚Äôt know them or aren‚Äôt related to them). She says she didn‚Äôt settle but I just don‚Äôt get how you aren‚Äôt settling if you aren‚Äôt physically attracted to the person. I do feel I will genuinely end up alone, rather be alone vs being taken and miserable. Not that this matters but I don‚Äôt really have an active sex drive, I don‚Äôt enjoy masturbating and haven‚Äôt had sex in years. I saw someone very briefly 3 years ago and while he had a decent personality, I wasn‚Äôt physically attracted to him. That was my closest to a relationship, you‚Äôre seriously telling me I haven‚Äôt been able to find anyone since? It‚Äôs like the universe is telling me I can‚Äôt do any better, I have never even introduced anyone to my family going on 30.

So I‚Äôm looking for an outsider‚Äôs perspective on things here. I (22F) am dating this guy (31M). This is a bit long but I don't know how to make it shorter. Thank you to anyone who reads. NSFW just in case cause I'm not sure how my self-harm, although not extreme, might affect others.

A bit of backstory: we met when I was working as a waitress around 2,5 years back (I was 19, he 28; at first he thought I was older, I thought he was younger) and flirted. Nothing happened because he finished his studies and moved back abroad to his home.

We stayed in contact a bit through the years and flirted some more. At the beginning of this year we met for a spa weekend for a hookup. He developed feelings for me and so did I, but it seemed his emotions were much stronger. After he flew back home he started calling me multiple times a day. After 4 days it got a bit much for me and I went offline for a day. I opened our chat the next day to see that he had cried himself to sleep, I had 4 missed calls and he ended the chat with asking me why I‚Äôm doing this to him. He thought I‚Äôd ghosted him, and I apologized.

I had talked about how I wasn‚Äôt ready for a long-distance relationship and how as a broke student I wouldn‚Äôt have the money to go see him overseas. He said he‚Äôd pay for my visit and that it wasn‚Äôt a big deal, because he earns a lot and could easily make back the money. After 3 weeks apart I got on a plane for a 10 day stay at his place. When it was time to get on my plane back home, we decided it would be too early to leave. I have online classes so it's no problem being abroad. I‚Äôve been abroad for 5 weeks now and am returning home next Monday.

Thing is, although I like him, I feel like I‚Äôm with Jekyll and Hyde. He can be so sweet, funny, charming, compassionate, etc., but we also get into big heated arguments almost daily. The fighting started the day I arrived. We‚Äôve had over 20+ more or less heated arguments during my stay. He has issues with jealousy since he‚Äôs both cheated and been cheated on (though he‚Äôs not sure he‚Äôs actually been cheated on and feels no remorse for his cheating, because ‚Äòshe deserved it‚Äô). He also said he ‚Äòdoesn‚Äôt like to lead with compassion‚Äô, because then he‚Äôll be a pushover.

\- He doesn‚Äôt like that I didn‚Äôt tell him my full dating history before we‚Äôd met;

\- He got mad when we were in a club and he found me in the unisex bathroom talking to some guy whose birthday it was (we had talked for all of 30 seconds after I‚Äôd chatted with about 6 women);

\- He doesn‚Äôt like that I‚Äôm in contact with people who like me but who I‚Äôve made it clear to that I‚Äôm not looking for anything with them (although he has similar relationships).

\- We got into an argument when I told him he had morning breath.

\- He has 18 daily habits he does, and he got offended that I didn‚Äôt want to take over those habits (although I offered to do the ones that were critical to him staying on track, like sleep and wake up times etc.).

\- I‚Äôm participating in setting up an event based around sex and sexuality, part of it being how to pleasure your partner. He told me I was insensitive for bringing it up with him, because I‚Äôm obviously going to jack off another guy.

\- He buys us tickets to shows, takes us out to eat, to go to clubs etc., which I‚Äôve had a hard time accepting and I‚Äôve made it clear I don‚Äôt expect nor want him to spend any unnecessary amount on me. He has said it‚Äôs not a problem since he's well off and he does it of his own free will and expects nothing back. Now we had an argument where he said I don‚Äôt pull my weight and it‚Äôs only he who‚Äôs paying for things.

\- We had been staying up til 2am most nights. We got into a heated argument because I ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt care about him‚Äù because I hadn‚Äôt thought of giving him a bedtime. On the weekends he has work, so staying up late affected him, which is understandable. BUT he guilt-tripped me about him being the one working to pay for stuff. It was my fault that we were staying up late, although it was always a mutual decison. I had no idea he felt so stressed and would gladly change things.

\- *The list is much longer*

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve never been an angel, and that there are things that I‚Äôve done that hurt him and that I could do differently in the future. I don‚Äôt have a problem with him bringing things up. The problem is that these arguments are often accusatory, resulting in me being labeled inconsiderate and uncaring, turning the conversation from problem solving to blaming. After arguing for hours he comes around and sees where I'm coming from and we find some sort of resolution, but it could be done in a more civil way. He now is upset that he feels he can't bring things up without it ending with him having to console me and me 'making things about myself'.

I like him when things are good, but when we argue I become afraid because of past trauma. I‚Äôm not sure what to do, because things can be really good, but the arguing is making me feel like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells. During one argument I tried ripping my hair out and clawed at myself. I‚Äôve never done that before. I‚Äôve had two long term relationships before and have never argued this much, felt accused, or self-harmed.

We‚Äôve had talks about the way we argue and what we both could do, but it feels like it‚Äôs falling on deaf ears, especially with him saying he‚Äôs been this way in his past 5 relationships and that he doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôll ever change. I‚Äôm not sure what to do, especially since he‚Äôs invested so much monetarily into this relationship and likes me a lot. There are so many good qualities about him that I adore, but I‚Äôm tired and not sure what to do. I know I can work on the way I resolve conflicts as well, with feeling less criticized and having more compassion. I'm just so very tired.

TLDR; Dating a guy who can be the sweetest guy on earth. At the same time he can‚Äôt seem to bring up things that are bothering him without it turning into a heated argument where I‚Äôm accused of doing wrong and being a bad person, instead of talking things through calmly and seeing what I could do differently in the future.

I see a lot of incels saying they only find women 16-24 attractive and that is very creepy. I as a guy think they‚Äôre just saying that to shame girls for aging as they can only impress young naive ones.

I‚Äôve personally seen gorgeous women of all ages some older women better looking than younger ones and vice versa. In my opinion it comes down to the individual, and also I find that coloured women in particular age amazingly. 

Some look even better with age like nigella lawson who was much hotter in her 50s than when she was younger. But my cut off would probably be early 50‚Äôs depending on the woman (I‚Äôm 25). Most of my friends agree with me whilst others think it‚Äôs weird but whatever.

Perhaps this is slightly unusual, but being in my 20s, most people are pretty forward thinking and is considered pretty standard to me.

Whilst I'm fine with this at a dating stage, I've found that usually, this winds up with me spending/paying more + more emotional labour and work around the house.

I feel like in my relationships, I do more in the relationship, I cook etc. Yet still wind up paying maybe 50%+ (I'd guess far more as I seem to do all the food shopping too) and splitting utilities and to be honest I'm pretty sick of it.

I feel like too many men are infact benefiting and taking advantage of modern women - as I don't think this new ""50/50"" is an even split at all.

When relationships/dating stages fall apart I always notice a significant hole in my wallet by the end of it all.

I've just started dating someone new (2 months) and I guess I'm wondering how to proceed - I don't want to be walked all over again or taken advantage again.

I have only recently just found out that my sister met up with my ex bf a couple years ago. But she never told me about it, and it just sort of slip out of her mouth. 

She said that they met up and had a chat that‚Äôs all. When I found out I was upset, I felt as if she‚Äôs done something behind my back and somewhat shady. Personally I believe that nothing has actually happened between them that it was simply a friendly meet up as they gotten along pretty well in the past. But why would she not tell me they met up?? 

However when I confronted her and asked why hasn‚Äôt she told me about it she claimed that she forgot and because at that time I was dating a guy she doesn‚Äôt approve of and hated me back then. It got into an argument where I said I feel she has betrayed me by meeting up with him and not telling me about it. But instead my sister said I‚Äôm being too sensitive about it and told me to get over it. 

I‚Äôve spoken to my parents about it they are all on her side and told me not to be upset about it as it happened years ago and also told me that I‚Äôm being too sensitive and maybe it‚Äôs a generational difference. I‚Äôve also talked to my brother who is the eldest of us, and he couldn‚Äôt comment and said he doesn‚Äôt know what advice to give me. 

Is it actually normal for family and ex partners to meet up and not tell the family member that had a relationship with the ex ?

I‚Äôve seen him every single weekend since the first week we met. He initiated the first four times and I initiated last time although he still ended up planning where we went and paid, even when I offered. He‚Äôs pretty bad about texting. He‚Äôs an engineer and is on call almost 24 seven and travels a lot for work. He‚Äôs been that way ever since we first started talking, very sporadic and his answers so I try not to overthink when he takes a long time to reply because I know he‚Äôs very caught up in his job. 

When we are together it‚Äôs wonderful, he acts like a boyfriend. I‚Äôve spent the night at his house in the past couple of times I‚Äôve been there he‚Äôs made me breakfast and coffee the next morning. We‚Äôve hung up picture frames together and he always asks for my opinion on things. We‚Äôve even finished a Netflix show together. This week he barely texted me at all which is sort of normal for him but at the same time he usually gets back to me at least within the day. He didn‚Äôt have a trip this week. I asked what his plans were for the weekend and he said that he is meeting up with friends tonight and then also he has people coming into town this weekend to visit. He didn‚Äôt suggest any plans. I asked if he‚Äôll be free at all this weekend, and if he‚Äôs wanting to meet or if he‚Äôs gonna be busy with his company. He hasn‚Äôt responded yet, but I suspect since he never suggested a date that maybe he doesn‚Äôt want to meet this weekend. 

I‚Äôm just a bit anxious because he‚Äôs leaving on a work trip next week and he is going to be on various trips most of April. We haven‚Äôt talked about the status of our relationship or exclusivity and I do want to ask him or at least gauge his interest in moving towards that kind of relationship but not put pressure on him. I think that‚Äôs something I need to do in person though. I was hoping to do it this weekend but now it‚Äôs looking like I‚Äôm not going to see him. I‚Äôm starting to get anxious because the fact that he is telling me he‚Äôs busy coupled with his late replies it‚Äôs making me feel like he‚Äôs losing interest. When he does eventually reply, they are pretty long replies back and he always asks me a follow up question. Could I be jumping the gun? It will have been our first weekend not hanging out. Maybe that‚Äôs not a big deal since I‚Äôve seen him every other weekend? 

It just seems like if he doesn‚Äôt suggest another date that‚Äôs a bad sign. Should I assume anything bad if he tells me that he can‚Äôt meet up this weekend? And then what should I do after that? Just end the Convo and let him reach out to me? I really like him and I was hoping to talk to him about how he‚Äôs been feeling this weekend but it looks like I‚Äôm not going to be able to do that now. I just wanna know where his head‚Äôs at.

Today a coworker told me that he was having a gossip with another coworker about people‚Äôs romantic lives. My work is full of young adults, I‚Äôm 23 myself, so there‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äòx is screwing y and z is jealous‚Äô, etc. always going on. My name got brought up in this conversation because this dude is always trying to set me up with girls, and he told me that she said to him ‚ÄòI‚Äôd be genuinely shocked if he fucks anyone in here, he just wouldn‚Äôt dare try it, he‚Äôs always too afraid to do anything, I don‚Äôt think he has it in him‚Äô

Hearing that kind of messed me up. I‚Äôm 23 and a virgin and I‚Äôm already insanely insecure about my (lack of a) romantic life, and I‚Äôve always put it down to me just not having some spark in me that says ‚Äògo for it‚Äô. It‚Äôs like I didn‚Äôt get a memo everyone else did when they were young. Her statement was honestly pretty true to what I‚Äôve always thought of myself; I‚Äôm just too scared, too anxious, too caught up in my head to ever attempt anything and so I sit and watch from the sidelines.

But something about hearing that it‚Äôs also how other people see me is kind of soul destroying. I keep my cards close to my chest, and I think outwardly I seem to have a weird confidence; you can definitely smell the anxiety off me, but I‚Äôm also pretty laid back about a lot of things and don‚Äôt get caught up in drama or really let on that things bother me. I can be absolutely dying inside while laughing something off with a smile. It‚Äôs not healthy and I have a ton of repressed emotions, but I always like to think people see me as more of a slightly shy, cards close to the chest type rather than the hopeless lost soul who doesn‚Äôt have the courage to even pursue a romantic relationship with anyone because he‚Äôs too scared. But it‚Äôs clear now that people do see it in me even if I try not let that side of me out.

Right now I‚Äôm actually crushing on a different girl from work pretty hard, and while it‚Äôs been kind of mixed signals I thought I had a chance. Hearing this kind of just brought me back down to Earth and made me laugh at myself. It was like I was reminded I have no confidence, no spark, no romantic energy about me, and while I can try hide and laugh it off everyone can see it eventually and will think of me as nothing more than a mildly funny, comforting pity case.

This girl I‚Äôm into I probably missed my chance with from exactly this; being too scared. She asked me for drinks months ago and I played it off and didn‚Äôt follow up. I danced around it all by messaging her a lot but it died off. I came up with every reason in my head why she‚Äôd never be interested, how she could never be attracted to me and thought of every bad thing that could happen down the line; how would I act on a first date? What the fuck would I do? I‚Äôve never kissed a girl sober; what would I do in that situation? God fucking forbid she wanted to have sex, I‚Äôd run for the hills. How the fuck would I even be confident, secure, healthy or caring enough to be a good boyfriend? I can barely look after myself. She asked me for dinner again last week and reminded me we had plans to follow up on and I gave some reason why I couldn‚Äôt and said I‚Äôd make a date at some point, but it‚Äôs just bullshit I‚Äôm using to protect myself from maybe getting hurt and maybe having to face rejection.

I‚Äôm terrified of romance for some reason, I‚Äôm still mentally like a 14 year old kid. Hell, I still feel terrified just talking to people and feeling awkward even if I hide it. And maybe I‚Äôve got better at hiding it over time and maybe I do have the confidence to at least strike up friendships with people I‚Äôm into and get to know them, but the thought of taking it beyond that is so terrifying that I find it more comforting to not try at all.

And somehow even though I tell nobody this because I‚Äôm terrified of being even slightly vulnerable, people can read it and while they like me as a person, they probably just pity me. I‚Äôm my own worst enemy and today was a painful reminder that I‚Äôm always getting in the way of my own happiness. My mind is a constant loop of; everyone must hate me now, god I‚Äôm so embarrassing, no wonder she doesn‚Äôt like me, what did I expect, she‚Äôs out of your league what are you thinking, you‚Äôre hopeless, useless, incompetent, you wouldn‚Äôt even know what to do if she did say yes, so why bother, you‚Äôll just fuck it up and embarrass yourself if she by some miracle doesn‚Äôt already think you‚Äôre a creep, etc.

You get the idea. And I‚Äôve been like this for so long and I know it‚Äôs not normal and I just feel like some basic failure of a human who can‚Äôt even work out the most simple things. It all just seems beyond me. I feel like I‚Äôll be alone forever and people can see it somehow and I can‚Äôt even change it; I‚Äôve worked so hard over the years to be more confident, make friends with women and be more comfortable with social interaction, and I‚Äôve definitely made progress, but I feel like I‚Äôll never just be good enough. I just feel like a total loser. It would be easier if these people saying this shit disliked me, but the thing is they really do actually like me a lot as a friend and that hurts more, because they aren‚Äôt saying this out of spite; this is just what they really think and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve always felt deep down too.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164439,public,self,"Social anxiety and fear have made dating impossible for me, and other people are starting to see me as a pity case",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tn3r8r/social_anxiety_and_fear_have_made_dating/,no_ads,0.0,dating,,,,,

Visited a friend in a different city, had a decent first date with a girl a met on an app. Was fairly typical, went for drinks, chatted, decent vibe. I paid although she did offer to split. Date lasted for maybe 3 hours. I walked her home and we had a quick kiss. Up until this point, she was pretty responsive to texts, replied within a couple minutes.

I was deciding which day to leave. I knew she was busy the day after the first date but decided to see if she was free anyways. No bueno. Asked her to raincheck the next day, no reply until the following morning when she asked how long I was staying until. I told her maybe the next day. I followed up by asking if she was free that night for a cooking date at her place, she got back to me a couple hours later saying she couldn't do that night but if I was ever back to visit she'd be down. I went with a last ditch effort asking if she was free for the third night, if not I might head back early. She said the third night worked for her surprisingly (I had assumed she was trying to flake me to this point).

Come the date, I pick her up, we kiss, head to the grocery store, pick up the few things we need, head back to her place. We make the food, goes pretty well. After, we put on a movie in her living room, with my arm around her. Half way-ish through the movie, I make a move and we start making out on her couch. She then tells me that she's not really down for a ONS (which is fine, I thought it may happen since she knew I was just visiting but I was also ok with it not happening). I told her that's ok but asked if she wanted to go to her room to chill there and she said sure. We go to her room and continue making out, I'm kissing her neck and whatnot and she seemed decently into it, but I didn't wanna push anything since I knew she wasn't down for a ONS. At one point she asked if I was ok since I was shaking (I was on top of her) and I didn't even think I was. That comment really caught me off guard so we just kind of stop and cuddle for a bit. The night ended with us just chatting and having (what I thought) a good fun chat. She had to wake up early the next day so I told her good night and was really happy to have met her. She said she was too. We kissed a few times good bye and I left.

The following morning, before I left, I texted her thanks for everything and I was happy to have met her. That was yesterday morning. She has yet to reply. I felt like we vibed pretty well and had an overall good time. Part of the reason she mentioned she wasn't down for a ONS was because I lived in a different city, so it probably wouldn't make sense (from a relationship standpoint). Tbh I would have been down to visit her (2 hour drive) and try dating as I thought we were pretty compatible. However, her lack of response and delayed replies makes me think she's not interested, which is the opposite feeling I got from our dates (why would she 1 - accept a second date at her place 2 - be willing to make out with me 3 - let me go to her room if she was not interested). I had briefly brought it up her delayed replies as a joke to her while sitting on her bed, and she mentioned how she was really busy since she worked in a hospital. I try to be a no excuse guy, so I'm not gonna make an excuse for her not replying to me yet and that I guess she's not interested. I just feel like I deserve a reply, even if she's no longer interested after a seemingly good second date. I'm just confused why someone who seemed so interested would just ghost me like this when I felt like I treated her pretty well? Seems like there's clearly no chance for dialogue to try to pursue this my further, either :(",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1164442,public,self,Girl ghosted me after a good second date at her place where we made out,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tn59z3/girl_ghosted_me_after_a_good_second_date_at_her/,no_ads,0.0,dating,,,,,

Me (30F) dating 30M for almost a month now. We have had 6 amazing dates, the last 3 were long involving staying over at each others place. Conversation flows when we are together and I tend to have a goodtime(it seems like he does too).

The reasons I'm overthinking are: 

1) we started off very good. There was texting back and forth for the first two weeks, the flow was good. If I could allocate time I'd say it was 30-60 mins altogether texting each day. After the 3rd date the flow wasn't there anymore. He'd text me good morning every day but that's about it, nothing else. Even if I reply right away, the message is not seen for a long time. I understand that we work during the day and it can get busy but even after work, which was the usual time for back and forth of text, the flow is not there. For example, tonight I had a text back and forth of 5 mins. Since I had this feeling, I tried calling him too. I thought maybe talking might be a better option. The calls were very short and the behaviour was not resiprocate. So I just took a step back and stick to texting. We're still in the getting to know each other stage and I feel like the effort on the other side is lacking compared to how it was two weeks ago.
 
2) I asked him out for the 3rd, so I was hoping he'd ask me for the 4th one. He did ask me to meet up for the weekend but at the very end of the week. I mentioned that I like to plan my weekends a little
ahead of time( beginning of the week) so give me a little longer heads up. 5th and 6th dates, still asked me at the very end of the week and when I asked when I'm seeing him next, he confirned at the very end of the week.

I'm getting a feeling of breadcrumbing here, the texts are just there to keep me in the loop and the dates feel like a I'm a last option which gets a spot after everything else is scheduled. This is how I'm feeling
about the situation.

I‚Äôm (20F) good friends with one of my brother‚Äôs friends (22M). We‚Äôre pretty close. We talk to each other a lot and we‚Äôve had a lot of d&amp;m‚Äôs (deep and meaningful). I picked up a few signs that he might like me romantically too but I don‚Äôt want to date him for a few reasons:

1: not 100% physically attracted to him, not enough to date or start anything with him

2: I‚Äôm very ready to stay tf away from being in a relationship right now. I don‚Äôt have the mental capacity at all. 

3: feelings have been fluctuating- usually not a good sign to be with anyone.
