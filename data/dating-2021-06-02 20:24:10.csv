And I’ve managed to stay single all that time. Tragic. I don’t really know what to do anymore.

I’ve got loads of close friends that I cherish dearly, but friendship only goes so far.. I need more, I need a proper life, I just don’t know what I can do anymore, it all feels hopeless.

Basically it’s not my personality, I’ve been assured that by pretty much everyone that knows me.

About a month ago, I met a girl through a close mutual friend. This girl is the mutual’s best friend. 

I had complimented this girl to the mutual a while back because I found her attractive, and was a little let down but also relieved to be told she was straight up lesbian. So I turned my back on it and didn’t pay much attention to it. But then I start actually talking to her. 

Turns out we have a lot in common. The same music, which is big because we both listen to tiny indie bands, same taste in food, movies, memes, you name it. Borderline the same person (rhetorically). We start talking. A lot. Mostly on snapchat. since adding me, we’ve had a streak going, not from streaks but from actual conversation. We’re now mutual #1s.

Then I learn that I was sort of lied to — not only does this girl absolutely hate being called lesbian, and “prefers gay”, she isn’t even sure if she is gay or not. She constantly reminds us that she just “doesn’t know”, especially when I’m around. 

Then the staying up until 3am on facetime, which has become a common occurrence, weird situations like when I had some friends over, the mutual tried to squeeze between us on the couch and she moved closer, and how she will ask a question about something like a love song, i’ll ask why she asked, then will stay on opened for a few minutes just to say “just wondering”.

The only issue: the last guy who expressed interest got completely blocked out of her life. I don’t think I want to take risks. That means I can not talk to the mutual about it, and I’m not very good at hiding it, so I need to figure out fast if she is interested or not.

We would text each other pretty much every night and he would FaceTime me a few times a week, but he’d eventually bring up something sexual in nature during these FaceTimes. He asked me to go over to his house but I wasn’t interested in doing that, so we decided to go to the movies. It was perfectly fine at first and he was enjoyable to be around, until the end when he became very touchy although I told him before hand I didn’t want him doing that. When I brought it up afterwards that I found it weird that he was essentially groping me in public, he became somewhat defensive and assured me I was remembering wrong. Anyways, after this he would FaceTime and text much less but would still ask me to spend some time with him at his house to “watch movies.” I would decline because I didn’t want to be in a position where I would likely be coerced into sex. Eventually, he stopped FaceTiming all together and would leave my messages on delivered for stretches of time, probably a week being the most. So now I’m confused, did he just not find me appealing or is it more likely that he was frustrated that I wouldn’t put out? I’m definitely getting the vibe that he just wanted sex but then why put in the effort of FaceTiming for hours and going on a date? He did say he was willing to commit but felt sexual chemistry was something he needed to be sure of in a partner, which somewhat makes sense but also feels like a ploy to get girls to put out?

Sob story sob story. But he said, he was healing going to therapy growing more compassion ready for serious things. I actually thought when I first looked at his worn and weathered face (everyone ages differently) but still ruggedly handsome that he was my age or older. In speaking with him more. I could see he was in fact quite immature but he still wanted to talk. I did find him charming and was taking my time with him. I spoke about being older and he dropped me. In fact he then went onto say that because, I am not a rock climbing, 6 hour a day blonde cyclist type in early 20's. (I'm more an artsy, curvy but well put together and physically I'm in proportion with exquisite bone structure, FYI.)

34,nr5sh1,1622698085,girl bff problems,"okay, i need help.

I am completely clueless when it comes to relationships. And i just got with this guy- my first boyfriend. And he is super nice and sweet. Problem is, i dont know if i am in my head about the relationship or if there are red flags that i should be recognizing.

1. He has a girl bff, who is also one of my good friends. This girl, we will name her Molly, Molly has dated my current boyfriend, but cheated on him, and got with his best friend. obviously, her character is questionable and God only knows why my current bf is friends with her still but she is. Before i started dating my current bf, we talked for months before, 2x. the first time, i stopped talking to him because i felt he didnt like me, and at this time, molly would always be like yes girl go for it. I later find out like a month ago after we started talking the first, molly kissed him. I was literally so confused and angry but I got over it. the second time around, my current bf and i got really close. molly didn't know how close we got. when she realized she literally started to leave her hooks into him. she would get mad at him when him and i hung out. she would literally say to him like "" I don't like you hanging out with other girls"". but even still, we hung out and eventually started to date. OKAY ENOUGH BACKSTORY, HERE IS MY PROBLEM: I recently was on a call with molly and we were talking, and she told me how my current bf and i hung out at the movies after work, and I, obviously not knowing was like huh? ALSO, my parents are crazy strict and would definitely not let me go out late at night to the movies with a guy- even less a guy i was dating. he knows all this- knows that my parents are strict. and obviously, them hanging out late at night made me uncomfortable. And i told him exactly that, i said like ""hey, i think i should lyk it made me uncomfortable, especially because this is someone who does not want us together"". and he was understanding in his own way like ""yeah, thank you for letting me know. i was just used to hanging out with her alot, but ill def lyk from now on"". and that was it, that was good. then the conversation got awkward and started to die out. and then a couple hours go by he texts me "" then i should give you a heads up then, i am hanging out with them after work ( a group of his friends and molly because they all work together), if thats okay"". and i was like yeah okay have fun thanks for lmk. 

He has been super distant or more less dry and i dont know if its because i set that boundary and he didn't like it or hes like loosing interest or something- i am not sure. But i do not want to have to worry about a girl bff in a relationship- especially someone who pretends to be my friend and encourages me to talk to him, but also asks me like ""what do you see in him"", and to my bf is like ""i dont want you to be with her""

39,nr6hra,1622700946,Help with an IG dm date request,There’s this NFL player that is super cute that I found on Instagram over the summer from my for you page. He is super wholesome it seems and not a typical NFL player douche bag who wants to be with multiple girls at the same time. He is a little bit younger than me but not so much that would make it weird. I don’t have a ton of followers on social media and I feel like the only girls I see him follow are people that have a large follower count. How do I get him to notice me? My acct is set to private and I don’t actively post a ton. It may sound arrogant but I feel like he would really like me if he got to know me and probably be attracted to me. The problem is do I go ahead and send him a direct message and just wait to see if it gets noticed out of the message request folder on Instagram? If I do send him just a message in a DM on Instagram what do I say because I can’t think of anything creative to catch his attention for a response? I know this sounds a bit outlandish but I was thinking of honestly doing a quick 30 second video 1. So he can see what I look like and 2. Just to be straightforward asking him out on a date and just going for it on Instagram and just waiting for him to see it from his Instagram DM request folder. What are your thoughts?

42,nr6zhq,1622702945,22F and never been in a relationship?,"I'm 22F and I've never actually had a boyfriend. I've held hands, kissed, etc but never been in a committed relationship. I've turned down several guys in my life but I don't think my standards are too high (they are probably too low if i'm being honest with myself). I've been asked out on plenty of dates but usually after 3-5 dates, guys will stop talking to me (either formally tell me they don't wish to continue dating, or just ghost me).

One time I got really close - there was a guy who was kinda obsessed with me, and I went on several dates with him because I really liked the attention and the feeling of being wanted. But then I realized I would never like him as much as he liked me and I had to end things.

One problem is that I'm a little bit introverted and usually on dates I am on high-alert to keep the conversation going and make sure it never gets awkward. (not sure if I am great at detecting awkwardness either). And another is that I am usually only attracted to smart/ambitious guys so that narrows the pool a lot. And i'm tall (5'9"") and would like to date someone who is taller than I am. I'm well-educated and take good care of myself physically and in hygiene/makeup so I don't think those things are the problem.

I used dating apps for 2 years but I recently deleted them all because it didn't feel like it was ""working."" All that happened was that I went on dates, but like I said earlier, the dates never developed into anything - only ghosting or rejection.

Does anyone have tips?

52,nr83s2,1622707491,I’m looking for a marriage partner but attracted to “fun” guys?,"Hey Reddit, I need some advice here.

I’m 27F and very much ready to settle down and have a family - if you asked me what my top traits in a partner are, I’d say emotional maturity, intelligence and ambition, and thoughtfulness. But yet I seem to want to go after men who are more “fun” rather than mature.

I’ve had 4 serious relationships before, and the one that I truly loved was with a man who was 5 years older than me, extremely fun to be with (we would do stupid things together, play silly games, get drunk, etc) but emotionally unavailable and at times irresponsible. My last ex was the most mature, kind and thoughtful person ever - but I didn’t feel sparks between us and didn’t feel the same intensity of love he felt towards me. 

Now I’m dating again and seeing someone semi-seriously - he’s more “childish” in behaviours sometimes (eg tickle fights, teases me a lot, spends a lot of time on memes/  video games) but we’ve had very mature conversations. We also talked about long-term, but at the same time he’s told me not to think that far ahead (ie. marriage) and that as long as I’m happy with him now, that’s what’s important.  

There’s another guy I’m seeing as well who comes across as much more mature, wouldn’t tease me as much, is planning to have a family and settle down, yet I don’t feel the same level of attraction and excitement about him. 

I’m reaching a point where I want to be exclusive with one of them, and I’m feeling a lot more excited about the first guy even though I see him as less ready to settle down, which is what I want. I’m afraid that he’s not as mature or responsible as I want my future SO to be, but yet it seems like people who exhibit those behaviours don’t excite me. Is there a problem with how I’m approaching this, and if so, how can I change my mindset?

I don’t know if she follows this Reddit, maybe, if so, hi. But this is venting of a thought that I’ve been working through for a while, for context. I was very close with a girl all summer of 2020, very flirty and joking, we kinda just chased each other back and forth, around November I told her that I have deep genuine feelings towards her, she said she had feelings too but had a hard time putting it into words, I told her we’d do things at her pace, then on Christmas we got closer with the “I love you”s and etc. (I’m trying to be as appropriate as I can with this) then in January we had our “first times” together, which is a very serious deal to me, I loved her 110%, then around the end of February she grew distant and I was worried that I wasn’t enough, she’s dated several boys in the past and had bad break ups, many of the guys I knew, then in early March she said she wanted to split, absurdly out of the blue, like a switch had been flipped. She told me it wasn’t the right time, turns out it was sort of a lie, then she said I texted too much (which is a ridiculous excuse) then I heard she just lost feelings which she denied. In the end she just wouldn’t be straight to me, I later heard she’d make fun of me behind my back, even talk shit, then after the split all of our mutual friends took her side (which there shouldn’t have been sides in the first place) and alienated me, now me and the mutual friends are sorta cool now, but she apparently can’t stand to be in group discord calls with me, maybe she just hates my guts now, I haven’t done a thing to her, she’s mentioned other boys she’s interested in in front of me and even compare me to them in front of me when she is in calls with me and others. I’ve talked to friends and they have told me how “I’ve done nothing wrong” and “it’s not my fault” but I loved her so damn much, she was my first everything and it’s a new kind of lingering pain, it’s been almost 3 months, I’ve been moving on slowly but there still has not been a single day in those 3 months where she hasn’t been in my mind in some way, even after all of this BS, how I won’t be invited to hangouts because she won’t go if I’m there. Even after all of this, I miss the person I thought I knew, I want to be over it so bad.

I asked to take her out again, but she said ""i am busy that weekend, I will let you know when I am free and we can go from there!""

I sent her a text saying ""cool, you must be a gemini no wonder we get alone :)"", and that was over one week ago, which she never responded to.

This was the weekend she was busy and I wanted to take her out so I have given her space, and thought she was going to reach out to me next week.

Her texting does not correlate with the date we had, in person it was amazing, over text its been dead.

I have seen her on whatsapp ""typing,"" but never sending anything for over a week now, so I have just deleted the chat, and tried to move on.

However I have a feeling despite her ghosting and us not talking in over a week, she MAY come back next week or in the near future.

I am unsure how to respond, maybe she was just busy, i have given her space, but shes just pulled away, and I am confused.

I do believe there is something there, but her flakiness, ghosting, and possible busy schedule has made it difficult to know how to respond.

I [23F] met this guy [26M] a few weeks ago and the conversations were amazing. It's cringy but I haven't found someone to connect so well with for quite some time. But since we're both in different cities, with the travel restrictions and him being a fontliner, we've agreed to take things slow. We've talked about wanting to meet when the pandemic cools down a bit, and also communicated our intentions of wanting serious relationships if and when things work out well.

And then, without a sign, he went radio silent on me for 4 days straight. The longest we've gone without talking is 1 day and he explained that he's really caught up in work, to which I completely understand. After all, he's literally fighting against a real pandemic and saving lives, of course I'm not demanding him to be texting with me 24/7. But right now, on the 4th day, I can't help wondering what's happened. Normally, under normal circumstances, I'd take it as a lack of genuine interest and move on, because well, the Internet is flaky and we all know that. But this time it seems like it's no normal circumstances, or maybe that's how I want to believe. I'm genuinely worried could he have caught the virus or whatnot, but then again he's vaccinated so even if he did, it shouldn't be so bad that he can't just send me a simple short message right? Also, normally there are signs pre-ghosting, like the drop in response rate or coldness in replies etc., but this literally happened without any of that sort, which is why I was completely caught off guard. After all, we were literally talking about wanting to be more open with each other in the last few messages, guess now ghosting is the new openness huh? I'm genuinely confused and disappointed and worried all at the same time. Like, what are the odds of someone actually really got involved in something terrible that they can't text you back?

But long story short, I had been interested in this person for a while, and had taken them out to a load of extravagant dates. Way more than what would be appropriate for the first date.

In addition, I bought gifts that they wanted and anything else that they asked for. So that person left the area I was in for the summer. I then ran into the person on the street, they put their head down and kept walking. I was sure it was them though.

I texted the person asking if it was them, and they said they weren't even in my city and that they didn't own that particular item of clothing that I saw them wearing. They even go as far as to send a picture of them at a different activity, allegedly proving that they weren't in town.

Fast forward to a few hours later they post a video in my city wearing that same article of clothing. There has been a pattern of untruthful activity like that from this person, but I was so blinded trying to impress this person that I ignored it.

They texted me last night saying no hard feelings etc, although that they were ""weirded out"" since they weren't in my city. It's morning but I haven't responded yet, but have been up all night thinking about it. How would you reply/cope with this situation? I've experienced dishonesty but never on this level so I'm a little shocked and taken aback.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nra74d/how_to_replycope_with_being_liedgaslighted/

The other day, we even went on a walk around the block after our workout, just chatted and got to know each other. We vibed super well, and I asked her if she’d like to go out sometime, to which she agreed.

After our walk, I handed her my phone to enter her number, and we said goodbye and went our separate ways.  

About 2-3 hours later, I shot her a text just saying I enjoyed chatting with her and I’d see her soon. I have an iPhone; and thru conversation I know she does too, but the text sent as a green message (SMS) rather than blue (iMessage).

I received no reply which I found odd. I was supposed to see her the next day at the gym and was going to ask her about it, but she didn’t show up 

Out of curiosity, I typed in the phone number into my phone but changed the very last digit to one number above and below the one she entered. Both of those showed up blue.

Should I assume she made an honest mistake? Should I text both of those numbers? Ask her about it next time I see her?

He has a sister (we’ll call her S) and her boyfriend (T) is the same minority as I. S’s pregnancy announcement was met with fury beyond belief from her parents, slurs thrown, swears, the whole nine yards. While the initial fallout was severe, S, T, and their child were allowed to be at a family cookout for memorial day.

81,nrddyr,1622726522,Meeting someone is based on luck," 

After searching for what feels like an eternity for a boyfriend or a future significant other, I’ve come to the realization that dating and finding a good person for you is just luck based.

Ground breaking revolutionary discovery…I know.

In all seriousness though for the longest time I always thought there was something wrong with me, that I wasn’t good enough or I had to keep “working on myself” to meet someone. Turns out that for most people this isn’t really the case and rather you just need to be at the right place at the right time. If you’re using a dating app then that means swiping at the right time.

For a lot of us women yes, waiting around can work sometimes because men are expected to make the first moves. For men however, waiting around and just hoping for a magical woman to fall into there lap isn’t going to happen they're expected to initiate most of the time.

In conclusion I’ve decided to just stop looking. Just going to live my life one day at a time and maybe just maybe I’ll have that lucky day when I’m in the right place and right time to meet him.

—

**EDIT - NO I’m not insinuating on waiting but still doing nothing. YES you need to actively be putting yourself into situations or places to meet someone, but not at the expense of your own self care or enjoyment. In other words stop chasing men and women an just live your life until you see someone of genuine interest.**

**For example don’t go to a bar or a club to meet a woman/man if you have no genuine interest in places like those just because people say those are good places to meet someone.**",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nrddyr/meeting_someone_is_based_on_luck/

Girls are so confusing man,"I went on a date with this girl about two weeks ago, went super well, spent like 6-7 hours with her and made out near the end. Went on a second date this week and ended up going back to her place and staying the night (I have roommates) ;) Was an incredible time for both of us and we got pretty intimate tbh, cuddled all night and deep talked and looked into each others eyes and all that shit.

I travel a lot for work and on our first date I mentioned that I would be going away for most of July/August. The day after our second date I received a call that I would actually be gone for most of June/July, so I texted her this and told her I really liked spending time with her and I hoped I'd see her when I was back. She left me hanging on this text for about a day and then texted me that we should see each other before I left. I said yes, of course, and set up plans for the following day. She started taking super long to respond to my texts, but eventually came around and we made plans to meet at 8 at a bar near her house. She texts back quicker than she had all day saying ""sorry but something came up at my apartment"" (she's moving) ""and I'll have to see you a little later"". Went MIA for 4 hours until I texted her to see what's up and said ""sorry we just finished an hour ago"". I didn't respond to that since I thought she was just giving me the cold shoulder but the next day she texted me ""Sorry about last night I know you're gone for a while but I really like spending time with you so don't hate me"". I responded ""I feel the same way, keep in touch and I'll see you when I'm back"".

I lost 50 lbs in the last few years, and I'm starting to see that my looks are drawing more attention. Please don't tune out just yet, this isn't a ""I'm pretty, feel sorry for me"" post. 

I've lived a very adverse life, some of the adversity stems from bad luck and some from stupid decisions. I was sexually assaulted at 18 and sought therapy for years in my 20s, and this has helped me tremendously, but I do believe it plays into my angst. As I'm getting older, I'm seeing how my life experiences have broadened my world. I'm very friendly and have an almost too foward sense of humor, and I'm trying to tone it down because I'm sure these characteristics aren't helping, but this is just who I am. Weird and wild things happen to me and by now, I've learned how to wield these things and become quite the story teller. I've got a good memory, and over the years, the stories have piled up. But I'm starting to feel insecure and like there's got to be something wrong with me or something I'm doing to entice these situations. Some examples:

A few months ago, I was at Walmart and got followed to my car by a real creepy guy. Long story short, the guy saw me a few people behind him in check out and moved to the back of the line to stand behind me, never said a word to me just stared, and then proceeded to follow me out to my car. I think he just wanted to look, and eventually he turned around and went the other way. I never said a word to him or even looked at him, even though he made it abundantly obvious that he was looking at me.

Or a couple of weeks ago, I was out to dinner with a girl friend that I hadn't seen since before pandemic and just found out she was pregnant. The server was definitely friendly and even brought me a sample margarita that he made and didn't even offer my friend one. Unless he was listening, he couldn't have known she was pregnant but he didn't bring her one. Eventually, he came back and insisted on me having a full one. I said no repeatedly and then he insisted on buying me one. I wasn't flirty with him, but I wasn't confrontational. Eventually I caved and when he brought it out, I drank about half of it. He wrote his SnapChat on the back of my receipt and asked me to add him. I did not because I wasn't interested.

Yesterday I was donating plasma for the first time and the young doctor who did my physical slipped me his phone number by the end of it. I was honest about my screening answers but I'm always throwing a humorous twist on things so I'm sure I made some funny comments. He told me my birthday was a few days after his and we shared some laughs throughout the process. I like to laugh, I love people, and I'm pretty social. I was just being friendly and I'm not interested in him. 

I've been seeing this guy for about a month now and I've shared stories from the past, and he's made a few comments about how nothing like this happens to him and there must be something I'm doing to entice these situations. He even told me it today. I've had a handful of other people tell me they don't have similar experiences and it almost always feels like they're telling me that I'm doing something to bring these things on. I know I'm friendly, silly, and approachable, and I don't shy away from strangers much, but it's starting to feel like maybe I AM doing something. I'm nervous to tell this guy about the doctor giving me his number. I feel worried that the stories of the silly or crazy things that happen is too much for someone else to deal with. I don't have much drama in my life aside, my practice for ""do not engage"" and ""try to fly under the radar"" has substantially grown but it's still happening periodically. 

I'm starting to feel dread now for social encounters because I don't want this kind of attention. Do I tell him about these things when/if they happen? How do I change to avoid the kinds of situations more? What do I do when people make me feel guilt for these encounters? I hate that I'm even writing this post.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nrecbe/do_i_30f_tell_the_guy_36m_ive_been_dating_for_a/

We used to speak regularly on  the phone/face timing and we like eachother. From early on i noticed  that we differ massively politically, which i informed her about, and  she was OK with that. However this always bugged me inside.

Later  on, for no specific reason we ended up not talking for 2 months, before  she suddenly reached back out again. I had been thinking about her  regularly during our hiatus but never planned to pick up the contact  again myself. Now that she reached out, we're kinda back in to talking  as usual again and it's honestly great conversations. I really like her  personality and her laughter. She is a great person.

I'm  just so ambivalent regarding our different political views. We are both  very politically interested but seem to avoid that topic which makes  for a pretty weird setting between us. She is a pure radical in her  field, bordering on extremism, and i'm on the opposite side of the  spectrum, being very much against radicalism/extremism. All her friends  share the same stances as she does and she's involved in different  projects related to politics, so the chance of change is probably  non-existent. The stances she represents honestly fill me with strong  aversion :(

So here i am, the last  days have been an emotional hell for me because of this. Yes, i might  be weak and fragile. But there are other reasons that politics are an  extra sensitive topic for me personally.

I  would be thankful for any serious advice on how to handle this. Or if  anyone have experienced something similar i'd like to know how you  handled it. My ambivalence and anxiety is killing me.

97,nrfb1v,1622731818,"First time dating in 3 years, forgot how much of a mental rollercoaster this is.","Downloaded a couple of dating apps a few weeks ago and am surprisingly getting way more attention than the last time I gave this a go during college. In the last 3 weeks, I've been on two dates and talked to a handful of women, all seemingly pleasant interactions. 

The first girl I went on a date with felt great, and she was already asking for a second date before the first was even over. She ghosted me. 

The next couple girls were just flat out lying on their profiles, which made the albeit short interactions feel like complete wastes of time once I knew. Side note, one of them is not happy that I've cut communications and has started to harass me, so I blocked them on everything this morning.

And last night, I went out on a date that felt absolutely amazing. Like, I haven't had genuine butterflies for someone in so long and it's almost kind of scary how into her I am after just one night out. I am really hoping she is being genuine when she says she wants to see me again soon, but the last date said the same thing and who knows what happened to her. 

I'm overall having a good time, and I know the complaints are minor in comparison to other's experiences, but god damn this is a mental draining ordeal sometimes.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nrfb1v/first_time_dating_in_3_years_forgot_how_much_of_a/
