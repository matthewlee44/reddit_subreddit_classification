I (f,23) went out with a man(35) on a date. We met online and were talking pretty randomly and more in an easy going manner, maybe once a week. He’s from another town (like 200 km away) and I was telling him jokingly to come so we could meet up. Last Wednesday he told me he could come for a dinner during the weekend day. 

He arrived, we went to a pretty fancy place, had a good time (to my mind) and then he got me a taxi (I don’t live close to where we were and it was his initiative) and once I got home I said I was safe and I thanked him for a pleasant evening. He said he is safe to his Airbnb too, he thanks me for a GREAT (:D) evening and that he’s sorry if he was too tired. I said good night and a kiss smiley and he did too. It’s been 3 days and he still didn’t reach out ever after. I messaged him myself. He asked me how I was and about some event that I’d have the next day. I gave him an info and asked about how he was doing. He only wished me luck during the event but gave no comment about himself. I replied nothing to it and today in the morning he wished me luck again (but no smileys and before he used it, extremely dry). I said thank you and that’s it.

Originally we went out in August but I rejected him b/c I felt like he drank too much on our date. I realized however we did have a good connection so I called him back 4 weeks later and gave him a 2nd chance. We dated for about a month but he didn't agree with me on my stance on sex (I'm a virgin and wanted to wait for a bit). He also almost got into a bar fight that I had to stop (and he got mad at me for stopping the fight) and ultimately told me he wasn't sure what he wanted with me and felt like he should know after 6 dates. It really stung. He told me that the night of the bar fight but I still slept over his place. The next morning he reiterated he wasn't sure what he wanted with me but asked me to go to breakfast with him. We had a good time and I ended up hanging out at his place for a bit. Before I left I asked him if this was still something he wanted with me and he said it was and would tell me if it wasn't and gave me a kiss goodbye.

The next day though I just felt like this was just wasn't going to work. I just felt like he wasn't fully in it. I texted him I felt like this wasn't going to work anymore and he said he agreed and we should change things before someones feelings got hurt. So I called him and told him we could still work things out but then he said calling him backfired b/c he got this text from me saying I wasn't feeling it anymore and then here I was asking him if we could still work it and and he told me he ""didn't want to play games"" and he was going to ""wait and see what happened and give us time"" but that he knew I wanted answers now. I said I understood and maybe I should've worded it differently and he said the details didn't matter. I then said we could just be friends and he said being friends would be hard but agreed. I then asked him if he wanted to help me look for a new apartment still and he agreed. I however never got to looking for apartments that week b/c I was flying out of town for thanksgiving.

Anyways I'm back in town now and I'm just really missing him. He likes my IG posts (both were selfies) and watches all my stories. I still have his clothes as well that I wanted to return to him. I just really miss him and want him back in my life. I also need his truck to help me move eventually this month.

So there is in my class a girl I find myself pretty attracted to. She’s a really extroverted person and enjoys being with everyone. I haven’t successfully talked to her because I am shy about it and have no experience in being social in general. At the very start of the year, my first interaction with her was her pulling a prank on me ( it was pretty funny). Then we would wave hands at each other and say hi when we saw each other but it never went beyond that and eventually, we just stopped interacting. Recently, we had eye contact in class and she smiled at me. She also said hi to me in the hallway. I know this is getting very long but the point is; I don’t know what to do. There are moments when I could talk to her but I never seem to know what to say (especially since that would be our first real interaction). I also don’t know if she is interested as well because she smiles and laughs with pretty much everyone. I am so lost.

1 month ago, we were sitting in the car and we finally addressed the tension that’s been building. then he kissed me (!!). since then, we’ve been hanging out around once a week, texting occasionally, and hooking up (although not all the way). the physical chemistry is very much there

my only concern is that things are super undefined right now. i told him TWICE that i don’t want this to just be a hookup/FWB thing, and he said that’s not what this is to him. he said he felt like there was attraction building between us over the last few months, but also something more than that. he said that when we hangout, he feels like a more positive version of himself.

BUT- on the other hand, he also said he doesn’t have the time to commit to a full-blown relationship right now because of his schedule. i know, i know - typical guy excuse. the thing is, even BEFORE he made a move, he kind of went MIA from everyone because he was so stressed from work. me being best friends with him, i know that his schedule is an actual source of anxiety for him

however, i’m also getting stressed at how ambiguous the situation is. we said we would only hookup with each other, but i almost feel like i need confirmation that he’s emotionally involved in us. should i bring up another convo? stop the physical aspect of our relationship? feel it out for a while since it’s only been 1 month &amp; i already told him i didn’t want just a hookup &amp; trust him?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1131744,public,self,in a “situationship” with my guy best friend. should i clarify what’s going on between us or wait it out since it’s still early?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r6wm2b/in_a_situationship_with_my_guy_best_friend_should/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,

After 2yrs he purposed and of course i rejected him, but at the same time i was so emotionally attached to him that breaking up with him was so difficult i didn’t leave my bed and didn’t eat much for days. We eventually broke up gradually, as it was extremely difficult for me and i was all alone. He used to say you love me but you are not in love with me. And it was true. The diehard hopeless romantic person that i am didn’t ever succeed to feel truly and utterly in love. It is weighing on my heart so heavily. For me a romantic relationship never was or will be a part of life, it is life itself for me and without it life has no meaning. My career, everything else means nothing to me.

Up until this year, my only romantic experience consisted of a long string of unrequited crushes. None of them even found me attractive enough for a drunken kiss, let alone a date. Some of them liked me as a friend, but that was it. The only guys to ever show interest in me were the occasional creepy older man, and a Trump supporting classmate back in 2015. Then a couple of months ago I went on my first ever date with a guy from a dating app, but he rejected me the next day.

However, two weeks ago I met a guy in a club who I was extremely attracted to and thought was way out of my league. But by some miracle he was actually attracted to me too, and we ended up making out. It was the first time in my entire life that someone I found attractive had actually felt the same way, and I couldn’t believe it. He kept saying how gorgeous I am, how badly he wanted to fuck me and he couldn’t keep his hands off me. He even asked if I’d go home with him, but I didn’t feel comfortable doing that (I have nothing against one night stands for others, but I wouldn’t want my first time to happen that way) so I said no. It was one of the best nights of my life though and I was (and still am) in utter disbelief that it even happened. 

We texted for a few days after that, and we even arranged to go for drinks, but when I told him that I’m a virgin and although I’m not necessarily looking for a relationship I will need to take things a bit slower (I didn’t volunteer the information but it came up in context) he lost interest and ghosted me. Now don’t get me wrong, I’m no idiot. I was fully aware from the get go that a guy I met in a club who tried to take me home the night we met wasn’t exactly looking for a future wife. And I wanted to have sex with him too. I was just hoping we could go on a few dates first at least. Anyway I’ve been extremely upset ever since for two reasons. 1. This is the first time my attraction to someone has been reciprocated, yet it still didn’t work out and 2. Now that I’ve actually EXPERIENCED more than platonic physical affection and being desired by someone I desire too, I know firsthand how nice it is and I want it to happen again even more. But I just don’t think it ever will. I’m convinced that that guy being attracted to me was just a fluke and I can’t imagine it ever happening again.

Deep down I’m a huge hopeless romantic, and I really do want a serious and meaningful relationship, but I’m convinced that it will never happen. I don’t think the issue is my personality because I’m very outgoing, friendly, caring, attentive, have a wide range of interests and not to brag, but I’m smart and creative. I’m also no homebody: AI have a very active social life and go out regularly. So it’s not like I don’t get opportunities to meet people. I’ve come to the conclusion that the problem must be my appearance. I’m definitely not ugly, and in fact after doing a TON of work on my previously extremely low self-esteem, I actually think I’m quite pretty. But I’m just not that stunning bombshell that most men seem to want. I’m short (5’3”) but not short enough to be deemed “cute”, I’m skinny with small boobs, I have light brown skin, medium length jet black hair, very dark eyes, a Roman nose and a square shaped face. I definitely don’t fit the western beauty standard (or the beauty standard in any culture for that matter) by any means.

Basically, I’m scared that I’ll never get into a relationship, and I suspect that my appearance is the reason. If it took almost 26 years for a guy I was attracted to to be attracted to me back, I highly doubt it’ll ever happen again. And even he was only interested in me sexually, so what are the odds of me meeting a guy who I’m attracted to who actually wants to get to know me romantically? Probably zero.

Sigh. Maybe I should just sleep with this guy seeing as it’s probably the best I’ll ever get.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1131751,public,self,Finally met someone who was attracted to me too and all he wanted was sex.

A couple mins later he texted me he had a good time and I said so did I. We texted for a while and Tuesday he said he wanted to hang out again. I agreed but once I got off work I canceled because I was honestly too tired. 

Today he asked if I was down to hang out at 5pm. I just got off work but I agreed because tbh I wanna see him. 6pm he texts back 'ok I'm almost done helping my little brother and then I'll be on my way' I said ""okay!! Can't wait😊"" but still thought it was weird he texted an hour later than our meet up time :/.

It's 7pm now and he texted ""I'm almost done I'm sorry!! Do you still wanna meet?"" I mean should I even meet him? Would I look stupid for agreeing 2 hours after our original meet time? I need help lol

Bit of background: my only long term relationship has been in University and my ex used to be physically and emotionally abusive. He would blame me for not having an orgasm through PIV sex and refused to go down on me/help me while constantly forcing me to do everything. He ended up cheating on me multiple times but wouldn't let me break up with him. Eventually I had to find a job in another country to escape that. 

Shortly afterwards I dated a guy for 3 months who was exactly the same about sex but atleast nicer about the whole thing. 

Anyways I concluded may be I wasn't attractive enough for guys caring about me during sex so I stopped doing it or even dating. 

Been 2 years since.

Present issue : this guy I'm seeing seems nice and interested in me as a person (met through mutual friends). I am really into him - I get tuned on when he touches/kisses me. But I am bit uncomfortable to have sex yet, because I feel insecure and somewhat afraid NGL. He has been testing my boundaries, trying to take it a bit further each time and I shoot him down. While he understands, it does anger and confuse me further (I understand may be he gets carried away by the heat of the moment?).

(I haven't really spoken to him about the past because I hate to discuss it.)

So the whole thing confuses me and I would like to sleep with him but idk I'll enjoy myself because of the insecurity. My question is how do I get over it? A book I can read maybe?

I (23M) knew my crush (20F) for a few years now. We worked in the same business together, and she dated my former best friend. He didn't appreciate her, and she ended up with someone new. During that time period, I developed a crush on her for a various amount of reasons. Her willingness to stick up for me when I was too introverted to do so, being up front and telling me when my former best friend had another person in their car talking shit about me pretty much all day, the way she was willing to quit weed for him just because she cared that much, wouldn't go to parties he didn't want her to go to because she cared, surprised him by paying for his food, always supported him at every event he has been at, and in the case of the new boyfriend let him work a show she wasn't even allowed to be at on Valentines Day just because she knew he loved wrestling. Before she went for the new boyfriend, I think I screwed up in typical not knowing how dating works fashion. We worked the same show and I let her know I was interested before but I wanted to give her time to get over her ex. At the show she told me her best friend was trying to get her with said boyfriend, but she didn't know yet. I don't know if that was supposed to be a sign that she was ready for me to shoot my shot or not, (possibly) but I being a complete dumbass said instead, ""I don't care if its me or him, I just want you to be happy because you deserve it, and I would like to know so I can move on accordingly."" Looking back I think that was a big mistake and I may have had a chance if I didn't say that. Obvously new boyfriend and her got together, and I tried my best to be okay with it but saw the signs I was losing my mind about it and eventually stopped all contact with her, because I didn't even trust myself around her anymore.

Fast forward to recent events, Its been a while since I talked to her, but she had been on my mind a lot still today. I've gone on vacations and still wouldn't get my mind off of her, but I kept it away from her to be mature about it. It didn't help that I got a playlist suggestion on Youtube that was literally about meeting the right person at the wrong time, and sometimes I think maybe that was the scenario then. I wanted to reach out to her and check up on how she's been, but needed a good reason to do so, so I decided to send her a happy anniversary message only to find out they aren't together anymore. She was at work so I'm still waiting to hear back details, and am trying to be there for her as a friend, but part of me also wants to let her know that I'm still interested in her after all this time. I've worked on myself alot over the time apart, and I know there is still more I could work on. I'm not gong to tell her immediately because that has always been a red flag to me going after someone as soon as you found out they weren't with someone anymore and especially if you just decided to reconnect with them out of the blue, no matter how much we knew each other in the past, and am going to focus on some of the things I need to better myself on still. But at the same time, I wanted to ask for advice on this situation because I feel like the last time, I waited too long to make a move.

I am quite sure he wants LTR (given we have gone on several dates and only kissed on one of them — he is clearly not in this for sex). I only want LTR.

Privately, I only want to date someone who is interested in marriage in the next 3 years and children in the next ~5. Even though that’s pretty normal (I am 25F and he is 26M), I don’t know how to convey this without sounding like a psychopath!

I don't know what I want anymore. I'm pretty much a late bloomer when it comes to dating, but I thought I had a good idea of what I want. I was previously not very open to anything casual because I know myself, I feel too much. But since finding a serious relationship has not been easy for me (due to not meeting people who want the same thing, or lack of effort in putting myself out there more because of self-confidence issues, among other reasons), I thought to give something casual a go just to have some affection and fun in my life. That's what I kind of have right now. I like it for the most part, and I'm actually surprised that I'm not having feelings for this guy, even though he checks a lot of my boxes. Being in this situation made me realize that right now I do just wanna have someone to have fun in bed with, and I might not be ready for something serious. If ever. I've always thought that I might be good girlfriend material because I'm caring, giving, and I just have a lot of love I've been wanting to give. But those things aren't enough, what do I even offer? Am I interesting enough? Smart enough? On top of my insecurities and overthinking, I'm also pretty needy, not great qualities to have with something casual. I want consistency. I want someone to have fun in bed with and have regular conversations with. I need to figure out what I want and adjust my expectations.

Now I’m wondering if I’m a person who can even be in a relationship due to my past actions.

We talked almost everyday and some times we would get flirty. Never told our true feelings though. She was super excited to talk to me and so was I, it was the best feeling ever. Recently, we went on a date (not really a date because we haven't confessed? plus there were two other friends) and I gave her flowers, she said it was the first time anyone gave her flowers and was super touched.

Then about 2 days later, we talked about our past sad experiences. anything to talk about. she mentioned about a past relationship which was about 7 months before she knew me. It was a very painful experience but she didn't told me the details of all the things that made her sad. I understood that maybe she wasn't comfortable enough yet to tell me all those things. A few minutes after that she said she was sad and told me she wanted to sleep. and so I let her.

The next day, we talked like usual but I could feel there was something off. The vibe just made me sad although there's nothing wrong. I didn't want to ask her why she was sad because she wasn't comfortable of telling me yet. She said it was just a random feeling and that she's feeling better today. But somehow I know there's something wrong and it just made me super sad. Fast forward to the night, our conversation became a little bit odd, I flirted with her for a bit and didn't received the same energy. made me extra extra sad and cried the whole night.   


Some time later, I knew about the thing that made her sad that night through my friend. He said that my crush was sad because she said she felt guilty to give me hope. She wasn't ready and still experience pain from the last relationship. She said she likes me, that I'm a nice guy and all and that she doesnt want to lose me, but she doesnt want to give me hope. Hence, that was why she was super sad and cried that night.   


After hearing that, I cried continuously for like a few days straight. I dont know why? because it's not like she doesnt want me, she's just not ready and she just needs time. But it felt so sad to the extent that everytime i see her face I felt so sad and I cant look at her pictures and all. I wanted to discuss about this with her but she's currently taking her finals and I dont want to distract her from her studies. All I can do now is cry and wait.   


So now, can someone tell me why am I sad and what should I do?

I decided to reach out to her. Shortly after she told me that she has gone through a divorce, taking care of her kids and working a bunch in a clinic with covid which has summed up her last six months. I told her I'm sorry to hear all that and that I always viewed her as a good friend even though this silence, she said to me that she appreciates hearing that now more than ever. So we decided to swap numbers and she even went as far as to tell me that I can text her whenever I want and if she is in the OR, she will even try to answer me then. I told her I can keep it at a texting level right now, she came back with ""I adore you"". She wasn't that hesitant to get involved with ""my life"" perse, not long after she got my number, she's starting to follow me now on snapchat.

The first time we text, I didn't get much because she was busy helping one of her daughters with a school project. The second time we text, we made small chit chat talking about high school. The third time we text happened to be Thanksgiving, basically I told her happy turkey day and that I was thankful we were able to reconnect and that I hope we can continue to keep in touch. She came back with ""Happy thanksgiving my friend! I'm so thankful that you are back in my life, you have always been so good to me and so supportive. I wish you an amazing day full of good food and wonderful people. &lt;3"".

So the last the last time we text, which was Monday, I found my yearbook and showed her what she said. She got a kick out of it and we made more chit chat, talked briefly about turkey day and she went on to tell me how she didn't have her kids for the holiday and just yogurt and granola. She didn't seem all that enthused to talk about it it seemed.

Anyways, I asked a couple friends and they think she's just talking to me just to be nice.

I eventually started distancing myself from people because of how hard post-grad life was for me. I blamed her for a lot of things that were going on in my life while keeping my problems to myself. I called her at night three weeks ago and told her I needed to be alone and meet new people. This was my way of pushing her away so I could focus on myself. This past weekend I reached out to her because I was having regrets of breaking up with her the way I did. I had a deep talk with her and realized a lot of the issues that were happening that I was causing that I didn't see. Most of the stuff I mentioned earlier, including pushing family and friends away were something I hadnt realized I was doing. I soon realized she had not only moved on but she was asked out on a date to which she agreed to go on very recently (couple days). I realized all of the ways in which I was treating her wrong and I wish so bad that I could go back and fix them. I realized how much she meant to me and how I would give anything just to have her around. I apologized profusely for all the mistakes I made and encouraged her to rant. She eventually told me she wanted to see me and I rushed to see her. I thought things went well. We got food and talked about our memories. She told me she wished she was with me and not the new guy. We hugged a lot and told eachother how we missed eachother and even almost kissed.  In a complete change of attitude, the next day she calls me and makes me feel like I no longer deserved a chance with her and that she no longer wished to talk to me.  I tried so hard to reassure her that I wasn't a bad person and that she would understand because she was in a similar position last year. She told me she counldnt forgive me. Soon after deciding I was going to let her be I found out she lied about when she started talking to the new guy. She wasnt recently asked out on date as she had claimed. She was asked right after we broke things off. I found out her and the guy had gotten close and he even met her friends on her birthday party.  I was mad so I called her the evening after deciding we would no longer contact bc I felt like she owed me an apology for getting my hopes up when things werent how she made them seem to be. She got mad bc I gave her anxiety with how I texted her my message and told me she didnt have to tell me anything and that I ruined every hope of getting back together in the future.

We met up and went for a night walk in a park near her, looked at the stars and had a good time with some deep conversation as well as talking and joking around in my car for 2 hours after!

So there’s this girl I’ve been friends with since around February. We have mostly been just friends with benefits. 

Throughout this, she has liked me, and we have been on and off about it and our “friendship” but we decided it would be best for us not to date because we both know I’m unsure if I truly like her. 

The thing is, there’s no issue with her, I do like a lot of things about her. Even her flaws. And I would have seriously dated her, but I never went through with it because I was scared that I didn’t truly like her. And that I would hurt her in the long run. Although ive always wanted to try. Other than fake high school relationships (sophomore year) I’m not sure if I’ve truly ever dated someone. All Ive ever done is mess around with females. 
Today she accidentally texted me that she has been fucking this guy. And to be honest it made me cry and hurt me. Although I played it off and acted like I was fine with it. Do I like this girl?

I’m 30F, he is 36M

Before he left my house he asked me…”so what do you like about me so far”

This after being together all day on Sunday [the date began Saturday 7pm at my house for dinner]) we were hugging and smooching and being flirty when he asked. It caught me off guard. I’m quite into him and I’ve sent the signals that I am. 

I chuckled and said that I like a lot about him but that I felt a little deer in headlights to give a specific answer. He chuckled said it’s fine and we moved on and we said our goodbyes. I texted him later what I like and he said it was nice to hear after waiting forever to get home and sent a heart emoji and told me what he likes about me and teased for not asking back (i just know it’s a not a super good question to ask). the text exchange seemed pretty joyful though. 

He was incredibly charming on the first date, we kissed within an hour of meeting. It was exciting but i thought for sure he is seeing other people. He took a week or two to get back to me on the dating app so it was already off to an unusual start.

He takes a long time to respond to texts usually (usually ~ two hours even if I respond to him right after he texts me) 

When we’re together I notice he is on or near his phone a lot. 

Also he seems to have an odd schedule. Which reminds me of myself making up my schedule to ppl I’m sidelining in dating- but he spends enough time with me on the weekend where I don’t feel sidelined.

I can’t tell where things are going but it feel relationshippy with mixed signals that aren’t apparent enough to ask about yet.

So why would he ask me this? Is he conceited? Actually interested in me? 

He asked me if he could buy a pair of prescription glasses for me so I have a more fashionable extra pair for me so that is also confusing. Like that’s kind of a committed purchase.

On our 3rd meet up he met a friend of mine and I out for dinner. I was confused about when we were meeting and he was being wish washy on the date time and plans so I asked him if we could reschedule. He said he understood but that he would love to join me on a night out. I asked if he would like to meet my friend and I to get dinner because I this point I made other plans. He at first asked if he would be a third wheel since my friend is a guy. I said no lol and that he is the main wheel. He paid for the dinner afterward which was quite the gesture my friend and I thought. And after the two of us went on our own date.

I was really caught off guard like I said about his question, mostly because of his confidence.
