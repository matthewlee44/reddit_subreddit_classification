recently about a week a go, I saw this fine girl looking at me and smiling while playing with her hair, I smiled back and gave her a wink and kept going... Yesterday I saw her again and she kept looking at me and smiling, I completely ignored her and kept walking, she is beautiful and I really want to take her out on a date but I did nothing about it, I don't know what is it but this keeps happening over and over again with other girls, it's not that I'm shy, actually I'm good with women, I make them laugh and I know how to talk to them, but I guess I'm afraid

I'm afraid that something will go wrong, maybe her brother will see me with her, or someone that I have beef with will see me and start talking shit or pick a fight, I'm also afraid that we will have nothing in common...

He was into me but I wasn't fully interested in him. We had each other on Facebook and over the years we would message but we lived in different countries. A few years ago he moves to England (not to my city) and said I could visit if I wanted but the conversation fizzled out.

Fast forward to 2020 when I shoot him a message asking how he is. He's pretty enthusiastic and we talk a bit but covid happens. 2021, I'm in his city and message him a week beforehand. Within minutes he replies 'of course we can get a drink! How are you??' and when I respond... I hear nothing back. The work trip gets cancelled but I find it weird that he doesn't text back.

2022 and my work reschedule the party in his city and I message him again. He responds within three minutes, sending me a voicenote saying he's working 12 hour days and might be tired but he'd try and meet up with me but asked me to remind him on the day in case he forgets. On the day, I message him at 2pm and ask what time he wants to meet up and hear nothing until.... 9:30pm where he apologises and says he was busy, saying that I was in the city tomorrow but he more than likely wouldn't be able to make it but he would let me know. The next day: nothing? I'm confused.

He's obviously not interested in meeting up, so why doesn't he just not respond/ say he's busy/pretend he's abroad? Why does he soooo enthusiastically greet me and then ghost me? I've deleted his number because whatever he has going on isn't worth my time but I'm curious. We've all had guys who've been keen and ghosted, but not at the same time?! Physically we haven't seen each other since 2015. My theory is that he has a wife/girlfriend/kid because whilst his job is hard/ time consuming, I just don't buy it.

I have a very solid group of friends, but zero female friends. Exes that you sometimes have a very weird talking phase with nearly yearly althoug nothing ever happens, dating apps throwing you 2-3 matches on a fresh account and nothing more after that - on top of that, those matches either never respond or are hella uninterested.

Then there is the fact you work/study in a male-dominant line of work. Not much of a social life.

I'm not depressed over being single but as a guy turning 22 this summer the lack of companionship is seriously starting to get to me to the point were I'm starting to have dreams about dating or cuddling. It's sad and pathetic.

How do you guys deal with this? Is dating even easier in the US? I'm from Europe and when I compare my Dutch culture to the US it seems like everyone over there is way more extraverted when it comes to talking to people you don't know.

He initially did not share this with me until I had to pry the information out of him. I asked him to consider my feelings and stay away for a while until the feelings subside due to his hiding. He blows off at me and says I'm just jealous and am trying to ruin yet another friendship.

For a little backstory, bf (29m) had a female friend N(23f) who is the younger sister of a guy from his circle of friends. Initially, I was bothered by the fact that she was only close to him in the whole group. And by close I mean showing up at his door randomly at night, inviting him to her only girls flat (1 hour away) regularly etc. Now generally I would be uncomfortable but I can understand that they were friends before so I didn't say much until I met her, I didn't want to judge too quick. But after the first meet, it got worse because she basically ignored me the whole time, always tried to get him alone to talk, etc. Even after meeting me, she always, and I mean always invites only him exclusively. Once she even came over for a dinner party and hugged everyone as she entered, I was at the other end of the room and she definitely saw me, (I was basically the host of the party, with the bf of course), and proceeds to not even come up to say hello. Again, I never stopped him from hanging out with her but told him about how uncomfortable that is for me. I have had a close male friend have a girlfriend who didn't like me too and I understood that it is uncomfortable and that's why I made an effort to make her see and we are now even close friends. Whenever I tell my bf about N, he brushes me off and blames my insecurities, and instead of trying to make me feel better, talks about how he is not going to let me get in the way of that friendship. Eventually, he does admit that she acts weird around me but doesn't change anything about it and said my reaction was getting in the way of his friendship and I should just trust him. The thing is, it's not about trust, it is about being heard and understood. To feel like he's on my side and not always the other person, or his own.

Anyways, fast forward to today. Since moving to a new place he has been hanging out with two girls and their friends. He apparently could not find any guys he vibes with enough and has thus decided that these girls are his click. The thing is, he didn't tell me he was hanging out with only girls until I had to force it out of him. And his reasoning was because of how I was with N, he didn't want another conflict. Logically understandable but still wrong. I tell him this and say that now that we are apart, I need to see some effort and sacrifice from his side for a while until we're stable again. To which he blows at me and says he will not let me get in the way of his friendships anymore and that I need to deal with my insecurities and not project it on him. Now the thing is, I never said he could not hang out with them indefinitely, I only said, that for time being, it would be best to maybe not go clubbing or go out for dinner alone until the situation between us gets better and I see some effort from his side. (Two days before this discussion, he decided to go out for dinner and doesn't reply to me till 2 am and I text him to check on him and find out he was in a club with the two girls instead. On the day of the discussion, where he blows at me, he goes out for dinner alone with one of the girls).

I am honestly so confused about how to deal with this now. Because on one hand, I understand that it's easy to just assume it's jealousy because he is exclusively hanging out with girls. But on the other hand, I have explained soooo many times what it is and he refuses to see my point and even at one point says ""no that's not your problem. You are just jealous and projecting"". Since then I have given up and he has been going out with the girls or one girl almost every single day. Mostly there are others around, also girls, but I just don't dare say anything anymore. How do I fix this? Do I fix this? What is the most logical next step? Because honestly, I still feel like shit, because nothing has changed on his side.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1159465,public,self,Bf(29m) asks me(26f) to not get in the way of his female friendships,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sul2q9/bf29m_asks_me26f_to_not_get_in_the_way_of_his/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,

For example, things like leaving her friends and coming over to talk to me multiple times, sending one of those anonymous online letters (which I later discovered it was her) saying that she was happy that we met and complementing me, friendly chemistry etc.

Well from the start I didn't want to ask her directly since she comes from a conservative muslim family, meaning that asking her out is a big no-no. So, instead, I asked if she wanted to work together on a mutual project and from then on see what the chemistry is like. 

So far, I'm starting to be convinced that I might've been wrong. At first she's slow to respond over text, the conversation isn't exactly dry but it isn't exactly much fun either, it's not going anywhere. We were supposed to have a meeting with a third-party around a few weeks ago, before the meeting she texts that the place was too far and if I would be ok handling the meeting alone. This was the tipping point. From then on we only talk when it's about the project, even when I tried to talk about something else she would continue the conversation a bit but eventually we're back to business. 

But you know what's funny? The past week we texted a few times for hours (the most being 4 straight hours very late at night??), we started with business then started talking about other random topics then we talked about each other's family and childhood stuff. Those times I felt it was a lot more reciprocal and fun. One time I tried to end the conversation and said that ""I had fun but I didn't want to keep you busy"" and she said ""I'm not busy at all, I'm really enjoying our conversation"" and we continued for another hour. She almost never texts first, most of the time I initiate but when I do we would spend hours texting and I get the feeling she doesn't want to stop? Tbh I'm even less sure and more confused, is she into me or is she just being friendly/shy now? 

I realize that I really do like her. But I don't want to take any steps that would make things awkward later. I apologise for making this whole thing an essay but I need advice please. Basically how to either move forwards with this or move on.

Tldr: I liked a girl who I thought liked me back. Through working together on a project I'm suspecting that I was wrong. Recent events makes me think otherwise? Is she just shy maybe?

Not my first rodeo in dating.
I’m a young bodybuilder, I make a good living and I’m good looking with a good sense of style. In a very populated city. 

Girls are never really a problem for me and I typically sleep with them first date 99% of the time.

Yday I met a pretty girl but she was NBA PLAYER TALL. I mean she looked like she could square me up. My height.

She was from Nigeria but real pretty and a total hunny bunny body.

We met up and spoke with each other but I felt like there was missing that rapport. 
We understood each other but I couldn’t feel the “connection” as such.
Typically I get connected with girls very quickly first date. 

I take her back home and we sleep but she doesn’t have fireworks. And I mean I gave it everything - strokes, head game, some crazy finger tongue and multi tasking techniques that every girl cums from. 

Nothing.

In fact, she humbles me and says “yeah come up, I won’t cum anytime soon”

I'm sure what I'm talking about here are done by a minority and that most people have used the concepts and ideas as a way for them to see different things in a new light; a new perspective for them to examine themselves and others.

\--------

Having said all of that, I do think that there's a lot of people that seem to explain away shitty behavior on their part(or their partners) as an incompatibility in communication styles/modes. 

I've also seen it as a way to stop a person trying to grow as a person, and not develop the skills necessary in how to actually express their needs in a way where other people can understand them. To not actually learn to handle other people's way to express their emotions or desires, or even understanding that other people have those at all.

I've seen people, on and off the internet, lay out a whole dissertation about how their partners reasonable asks felt like demands or threats. I've seen the idea about love languages been used to justify the worst possible intent on their partner in various ways. Either the aggrieved has that type of love language that attracts toxic people, or the party that doesn't know that they're on trial is inconsiderate for having their specific needs in the first place. 

Other times, I've seen people excuse themselves or others for acting like an complete asshole. That the reason for them acting out is because they've tried to express themselves nicely so many times, so now they lash out so that their partner will finally see them.

It's ironic that something with the word *language* in their name is used to stifle communication. Instead be used as a justification for people to not bother to understand, but just be reactionary to what the other person tries to communicate.

When I was struggling with it he made a comment how he wishes we were further along or he would of just have got me a lease, which I later brought up it was mean and unnecessary to say if you’re not gonna do it. Then about a week later he surprised me that he leased an Audi that I can use for a few months, brought me to the dealership all that. I asked the lady selling the car how long it was for and she said leases usually go longer than that so she thinks he got it for longer. So it definitely made me excited, thinking I was set for at least a year. Then he eventually tells me he actually bought the car, and he’ll eventually give it to his son or his employees. I appreciated the help still but it was a little disappointing. Then while we’re on a trip he tells me he told his son the car was his once he gets a job and holds it for 3 months. He has a 5 year old daughter I love and have gotten close to and his son is a year younger than me. He’s 23 I’m 24. He already crashed a brand new Porsche, steals from him, and has never worked a day in his life and is getting the car I’ve been driving for months. He openly talks to me about it and thinks he spoiled me so much by letting me drive this for a bit but he doesn’t get how hurtful it is, because I’ve hustled and worked so hard for everything I have. He also doesn’t make it seem like he’s planning on helping me with my next car either, has more been just helping me look and asking my budget. I’m not saying I expect a car from him but help on the down payment I don’t think would be much to ask for. For some perspective, he’s extremely wealthy, and spends like crazy. Bought a $10-15,000 private plane to come see me because I was “lonely” (when no he knew I was alone in a hotel room (ya family issues don’t ask) and he was horny. He has spent $14,000 in one day for a private yacht with a chef for us. He spent $40,000 that long weekend trip. Another $40,000 trip a couple months later. . he’s talked about spending 15k shopping. He has multiple nice cars, one worth 1.5 mil. While we keep getting closer and I can count on him day to day, we love each other and I love his daughter and am meeting family and friends, it seems like he withholds from me a bit with girls and stuff compared to how he used to. He’ll spend a lot of money when it benefits him, and would take me shopping at the beginning but kinda acts weird about it now. He got me a car rental when I was home visiting family when he knew I’d be borrowing a car from another guy, but I know he wouldn’t of done it for me if I was just stuck without a car. At this point I’m considering asking for help with the car down payment but am not sure how to ask. I’m never the type to ask for anything like this, and truthfully I am not sure of the best way to ask because I already feel resentment. There’s even more to this too but this just brushes the base of it because I know it’s a lot to read. Any advice is welcome and let me know if you have any questions. 
If this changes anything for you even though I figured it was implied already but I do get an allowance every month, slightly above average but it definitely does not leave me with much leftover after paying bills, saving money, keeping up with hair nails lashes etc. He is letting me stay in one of his properties for a couple months longer until it gets knocked down so that’s nice, but he’s also saving a lot on hotels he would usually get for us right now.

I've been using dating apps for a few years right now and released in beta my own. I liked the concept Tinder had in the beginning but I believe some poor decision making (optimized for revenue) led the app in the wrong direction.

Pros:

* The swiping mechanism is good, in theory it lowers fear of rejection and a mutual swipe should mean some interest from both the parts.

Cons:

* Too many core features are behind a paywall. Seeing who liked you is one of the most import ones and I believe it should be free.
* The massive imbalance between genders deteriorates the interaction in the apps too much. Should them try to address it? Usually the male are way more than females, should you lose potentials male users (and consequentially potential revenue) in order to keep a balance? I think it would improve the overall online dating experience.

Lack of ""personal infos"" on Tinder? A bio and my Spotify does not represent me well enough and is too shallow? Bumble tries to improve this part by adding way more infos but I do not think it solves the problem.

This time he picked me up and drove me to some restaurant by the sea. I really had a nice time with him, he is very funny, makes me laugh and I find the conversation with him flows very easily. I told him during the first date that I am not looking for anything serious or exclusive at this point of my life, and he seemed on board with that.

I also have a high sex drive and I am very attracted to this guy so I was kind of hoping he would make a move and take me to his place after the date, even if we hadn't talked about anything sexual or even kissed yet. However he wanted to drop me home right after dinner.

I told him I didn't wanna go home yet as it was still very early and I didn't have work the next day, so he just parked somewhere and we were chatting in his car for ages. After a while we weren't getting anywhere  so I kissed him and we were making out for a bit. But he didn't seem like he wanted to take things any further and I didn't want to make him feel uncomfortable or push it. I asked him to drop me home and message me once he got home.

He texted me that he got home and after I replied he left me on read and didn't message me again. I was a bit disappointed after the night but I understand I had some expectations that maybe I shouldn't have had and he didn't do anything wrong. But now I am afraid I have put him off and he doesn't want to meet me again.

Main reason being, I'm literally a grown adult and being an adult there are some roles you're supposed to fill depending on the relationship. Everyone around me is very active, so it makes me think I have to be active as well. The reality is I can take or leave being active.

When I'm alone I don't really feel that excitement, if you catch my drift. If anything I just feel like I wasted my time. Maybe it'd be different if I had a partner, but when I think about it, I don't really have the urge to do anything with them as well.

I tend to crush on people that are very active and it makes me worry that I won't live up to their standards if I decide to lose it one day. So I been avoiding it in general. Like I said, I could take or leave the activity, it's just really not my cup of tea.

Anyway I woke up to a message telling me she had a doubt about me and needed some time but the finality of the message felt like she was ending it. Her doubt was that she ‘saw some deep-rooted misogynistic bias’ in me and that it was ‘pretty obvious’. This made me feel a little sick as I have always felt like throughout my life I have always been an advocate for women, calling misogyny out in workplaces or with my dad, I have more female friends than male and 2 sisters of which I am really close to and have talked them about their misogynistic experiences. I have a feeling I may have given her this impression based on something I said a week or so a go regarding dating. Basically I mentioned how I have a bit of an issue with the initial parts of dating, when I get to a point where I know I like someone I start to feel a bit weird because I don’t want to look like one of ‘those guys’ that are a bit seedy and overstep their boundaries and because of this I struggle to make the first move but I feel like it might have came out a bit more like ‘oh look men have it bad too’ and possibly gave off the misogynistic version of ‘white lives matter’. I definitely need some time myself as i think we were going a little faster than Id like but I don’t want her to see me that way whilst she takes some time to evaluate the past few weeks with me. I spoke to my sister and asked her if she thinks I’m misogynistic and her exact words were ‘your the least misogynistic guy I know’ but since she knows me she understands how I could be misconstrued when i talk about things if someone doesn’t full know me. I think maybe I was getting so comfortable with this girl i kind of forgot that she still doesn’t really know me yet. I have responded and she said after shes had time to think she will explain what she means in real life. Is it just as simple as giving her time then trying to explain this? Or could there be a different reason? Id assume that if she had another reason she would have lead with that as it would be much easier to just say, ‘i dont like you’ or whatever rather than calling me out as a misogynist.

I’ve been talking to this guy and he asked me to reach out to him once I’m back home. I won’t be back until March due to a family emergency. I said this to him 

“Hey, sorry I haven’t reached out I’ve been stuck in NY. How have you been?” 

And this is how he responded

“ Lol are you ever coming back!?  I’ve been good though.  Getting pretty busy with work but it’s all commission so I’m not really complaining about it.” 

How should I respond to what he said? Can someone give me a some fun ideas? And should I comment on what he said about his job? And should I say why I got stuck?

I came up with this.. but I don’t know if it sounds vague..

We sort of tried to date briefly when we were thirteen - to put it mildly, he swiftly and completely dropped the ball and hurt me badly (at a time in my life when I was very vulnerable, too).

Fast forward years later when we were nineteen. He expressed a genuine interest in trying again to have a relationship with me - I figured, well, we were both adults now. Surely he had grown up over the years and changed for the better.

Boy howdy was I damned wrong. 

To start off? He bragged to me shamelessly about how he had cheated on every girl he had ever dated in the past - but insisted that was the past, so I was willing to overlook that.

His behaviour also made it crystal clear that I was not even remotely a priority to him. He worked out of town during the week, I got that - but he came back into town every weekend and stayed with his parents. Yet apparently literally every moment of every was spent with them, and I literally had to beg for him to spare an hour to come to the park with me or something. He told me to suck it up and get over it.

Then when we finally had an actual date, which was actually quite nice - I suddenly got ditched in a strange part of town, in the middle of the night, in February, in freezing rain, with no way to get home safely. Luckily, I was able to find a gas station, find out where I was, and call a cab, which I luckily had money to pay for. I was upset, and he tried to make it out to be all my fault. I still wanted to try with him and was still nice to him after that.

Then, he went on a trip out of town to so e comic book convention or something. With a bunch of other girls. No guys, except for him - literally just a bunch of girls. He absolutely refused to let me come with them, even though I was completely ready and willing to pay for all of my own expenses. I was pissed and hurt, but still continued to hope and try to be nice to him.

Then, after all of that, he cheated on me with another girl and dumped me for her.

Hard to believe that I was so naive once. So sweet. So tender hearted. That I wanted to think the best of people and give them the benefit of the doubt.

I'm in my late twenties now. Years later he actually messaged me on social media saying he was a monster and that he was sorry. I told him on no uncertain terms to get lost.

Moral of the story? Do not give people chances they have done nothing to deserve. If someone hurts you, and they know damn well that they hurt you, and are not the least bit apologetic about it - simply walk away. That person does not and never will care about you. They do NOT deserve you.

First if you broke up - congrats, your emotional rollercoaster is getting over soon, and you can begin focusing on loving yourself! Now why would you waste your precious time and Energy hating him. 

For context, my ex was in fact a narcissist, professionally diagnosed with severe ADHD, BPD and something else (I forget). He did all the things you would expect someone like him would do (constantly lying, manipulation, victim blaming, victim mentality, emotional/verbal abuse, etc.). If I stayed longer, there would have been cheating, and definitely physical abuse. I do not throw these terms around lightly. Leaving was a hard, but the BEST decision I ever made, because honestly I began to be scared of him. Of course, he pretended to be kicked out of his household, be suicidal, lose his Diploma, pretend his dog has cancer - virtually everything to get me to feel bad and stay. And when I blocked him on everything - he began EMAILING me, trying to bring me down, attacking me, and to this day he's still attempting. 

I've done some reflecting, and I'm actually very **grateful** for him, and this experience. Yes I've went through all the stages - being upset, hating, making him insignificant, etc. But it was a very valuable lesson. I forgive him, but I refuse to make the same mistake again. Here's some things that helped me, with personal examples. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Don't classify him as a 'normal' person , he's not**. Okay so this point may get backlash, but it helped me the most - allow me to explain. 'Normal people' would NOT do such sick things, and expect you to stay/degrade you when you don't' (-words of my therapist). Mental illnesses are important, and not to be taken lightly. It's not his fault either - it's the way he's wired, so have pity on him. It makes everything better :)
2. **It doesn't matter what lies he spews.** What he says REALLY doesn't matter because you know the real version of the truth - and that's all that matters. Who cares what he thinks - NOW, he's insignificant in your life. 
   1. *ex.* Mine said that the relationship was my fault, since I could never deal with conflict and blamed me. But that's not the truth, no? Saying ""*I need space for a little bit*"" was MY method of approaching - I would carefully analyze the situation from both ends, rather than saying something 'in the moment, and regretting it'. After I had my space, i would reproach the issue Frankly, it was much better than his, who was very confrontational and he said very hurtful things in the moment. 
   2. He also made me out to be crazy, saying that I made him block multiple girls for no reason. Uh - didn't he ask me to do that since he liked it, and make me block more since he felt threatened? ALSO - begin talking to those you blocked again, and apologize. It was NOT right for him to do that, and don't throw away valuable friends, for someone like him. 
3. **It doesn't matter what insults he says.** Okay, so as I mentioned earlier he's actively trying to bring you down, make you feel worthless without him and put himself above. Rather than being mad and annoyed like I did before, I laugh now - it all seems really pathetic, like move on already and get a life! Also, I highly recommend analyzing every insult he says, and question whether it is true, or is he just projecting his self hatred onto you?
   1. ex. Mine listed all my insecurities, everything I ever told him and used it against me - a line that I would never cross, and I still won't cross. I'm so much better than that, and there's a reason why trash stays on the ground. So don't list all his insecurities. Anyways - Okay, so yes I might have been a little bit insecure about myself - who isn't! I might have not liked my weight (which I learned to love now and ignore my body dysmorphia). But who was MORE insecure? In my case, my ex edited his shoulders to make them look bigger - which frankly is NOT normal and was a MAJOR catfish move I noticed immediately 😭. Of course, I would never tell him, or ever mention it. Also, MANY other insecurities (which I will not list). Main takeaway - don't listen to him, he's projecting his insecurities onto you, and do NOT stoop to his level.
4. **You are worth so much more than you think.** ANYONE would be lucky to have you - you're gorgeous, smart, everything bro. You have to realize that for yourself, and start acting like it! 
   1. ex. When I came out of my hellhole of a relationship, I realized how many people wanted to be 'next', and who treated me so much better when we were just hanging out. Of course, also do not JUMP on the next person quickly - work on YOURSELF. Do not use someone t get over him - it's bad (I found myself falling into this trap, but quickly caught myself). Realize his chapter in your book is over, time for a new one :) 
5. **You know your weaknesses for the next relationship**. Yes completely messed you up, but you also learned some stuff about yourself. Maybe you learned that you should manage your emotions better - try meditation, learned to be more confident - affirmations or be more trusting - time heals. So now let's work on ourselves, be INDEPENDENT, and be a better version of yourself - and for the guy who's lucky enough to have us next ;)
6. **Use this as motivation:** Use this time to better your physical body (adopt a skincare routine, or maybe go to the gym, or learn to love yourself. In my case, I used exercise to get rid of my thoughts, and I LOVE my body :). Also, enrich your mind - read books instead of browsing in social media (delete it if you can), and practice meditation. Be confident and do something you've always wanted to! Sneak out, go for a drive, go ask that guy for his snap if he's cute
7. **Don't compare your career and his.** For context, me and my ex were going into the same field. Then he tries to bring me down by saying 'im doing better than you ever will - I have a cali internship'. Okay AND? Will that cali internship solve the fact that you now drink yourself to bed, or that you're extremely unhappy with yourself. NO! I'm really happy with myself on the other hand, and I realized that money isn't everything - prestige isn't everything. I'll be successful for sure, but my happiness also comes first. Also, To be honest, I feel bad for him and forgive him - hopefully his next victim leaves earlier before she gets trapped. 

In the end, I don't feel hatred, I feel bad for the man. It's so pathetic the amount of times he tries to get my attention, and me and my friends laugh about it now whenever we see it now and then. Now, i've even learned not to read it, because it's honestly a waste of energy. I forgive him and everything he's ever done to be honest - after all, I made some good memories, explored a new city with him, etc. I just won't forget this lesson :)

He is incredibly loving, affectionate and thoughtful. Our values/beliefs are very similar and he has a good head on his shoulders, and for that I admire him and trust him 100%. This feels like the healthiest relationship I've ever been in, and I can see a future with him being a great partner/dad.


We see each other a few times a week and he often expresses that I'm beautiful how lucky he feels to have me. Both of us are very affectionate, and have talked about how it's nice (since our previous partners never really enjoyed physical touch very much). However, we've only had sex one time, and it ended quickly when the condom broke. There's been many times I've tried to initiate (let my hands wander, went down on him) but he never takes the opportunity or only gets semi hard. I've talked to him about it and he said he's said he's nervous about his performance, and that it's hard for him to initiate. He's also mentioned that he feels smoking weed numbs him, and for a period of time he quit and seemed to get a stronger erection. He says it's something he's working on, and I'm trying to be supportive and patient, but I'm getting discouraged thinking he may just not be a sexual person. His stance is regardless of what happens in the bedroom, whether it works or not, he will still love me. This is often in the back of my mind because I don't see myself in long-term relationship that is non sexual.

“ Lol are you ever coming back!?  I’ve been good though.  Getting pretty busy with work but it’s all commission so I’m not really complaining about it.”

(I am in a relationship and all is fine but I remember i had a conversation about this with a friend some years ago and just saw a post that made me think about it again) 

It’s something i have experienced with several ex’es and i have a lot of friends that have had similar experiences. 

It’s like they believe that they’re doing us a favour by having sex with us? Phrases like “i already gave you an orgasm, what more do you want” when you ask them to take their wet towel off the bed or clean up after themselves. Like what? 

First of all we are two adults who want to have sex with each other. We both benefit (not always equally lol i know i know) and we both enjoy. It’s not a favour, it’s not a sacrifice and it’s not something you can bring into the whole “we need to do equally much work in the house”-discussion. It’s so messed up. 

Secondly, just clean up after yourself? Take responsibility for your own hygiene, your house, your relationship… be a responsible person. Get off your ass. Maturity is sexy. 

Guys, your d*ck is not Gods gift sent from the heavens. You still need to be a good person, you still need to attend to your girl (or boy or whatever you’re into), you still need to put some effort into the relationship - your d*ck isn’t something you “give” to get a free pass for everything else. 

It really amazes me that so many guys think like this",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1159513,public,self,Why do so many guys think that their only contribution to a relationship is giving their d*ck?!,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sutphz/why_do_so_many_guys_think_that_their_only/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,

My SO is generally very kind, loving, driven, motivated, and thoughtful. I am suffering from depression and I feel like them entering my life has helped and made me happier.

I love them and do not see myself with anyone else but they have expressed multiple times to me that they are unsure about the relationship. Their reasoning for this is because they feel a great imbalance in the relationship due to a lack of effort on my part. Along with a lack of effort they see me as someone that is lazy, unmotivated, and selfish. In addition, they don't see love being shown to them or anything done that I would not do for anyone else.

There have been times where I have found it hard to motivate myself to do things and believe my depression plays a factor. It deeply hurts knowing that they believe that they love me more and don't feel the same level of love from me. I've expressed some mental health concerns but they have said they don't want to be with someone that needs to be changed that does not have their life together.

After hearing why they believe there is a lack of effort from my part, I am doing my best to put in more effort but I am still hearing that they do not see much of a change and getting nothing in return. Since we are long distance, I do my best to talk to them all day, spend time with them, and openly communicate. I've always had trouble expressing my feelings and I want to show them that I am trying to put in my effort but I am having trouble doing so.

With this being my first relationship, I am scared to try many things sexually which leads to them seeing an imbalance of sex where they are doing a majority of the work to please me. I wanted to please them but with it being my first time I felt nervous, self-anxious, scared, and backed out several times.

With all this being said, what I'm really looking for is advice. What are some actions or things that I can do to show my partner that I love them to demonstrate that I am putting in more effort?

Had a crush in high school and about a year ago she mentioned that she also liked me back then. We've only been friends since then for the most part until March last year. I should add that I've never really been in a relationship. I have met up with girls i was interested in but nothing came out of those.

She got a bit tipsy and mentioned that maybe we should be FWB and I said I agreed. We've talked pretty much every day ranging from the mundane ""how's your day"" to spicy or deep topics. Sometimes it feels dry or that she is texting to just say something , though it could be in my head. We've hung out a few times (since we're both busy and I had some heart issues she wanted me to check before doing anything) and we've made out those times and even a little bit more but not all the way. After a while, it's obvious that she would much rather be in a relationship with me but I cant really decide what to do.

I am attracted to her to some degree because I do think about her but that's probably me picturing her as I want her to be. We have some differences, the big ones we talked about was that she didnt really wanna get married or have kids. Once I brought those up, she explained that she doesnt see herself doing that right now and she might change her mind in the future, but she may just be saying that now and then she still feels that way later. There's other things like us not having that much in common and she doesnt seem to have hobbies or her own things so she appears kinda boring? She also is a bigger girl and although I am glad she does like herself, she doesnt appear to care she doesnt appear to be doing anything to better herself. I know this shouldnt be an issue but after having my dad pass away when I was young because he did not take care of himself at all, there might be a bit of trauma/unresolved feelings in that area. There's other small stuff that im sure someone would hear and think those arent big deals and I acknowledge that.

Right now, we havent consistently talked in a while. She mentioned that she's gonna try to just get over it or accept that I may not want to be with her and I think this is her way of doing it, though she says that she's busy with work and family (even though she talked before when she had family over and she was working).

At the beginning of last month, I moved to a new city where I knew nobody. Matched online with this great girl - we went out on 4 dates, slept together, had a ton in common, we just ""clicked"". I spent the night two times and didn't even sleep with her until the second night. I felt like waiting was the right thing to do because I actually liked her. It felt different. The effort I was putting in was finally being reciprocated (in the past it hasn't always been that way), and it really felt like it was going somewhere. I told her I liked her, and she said she liked me as well. Now I haven't seen her in over 2 weeks. She says work is very overwhelming and that sometimes she just feels like people are ""too much"" and that she feels like she wants to be invisible and have nobody talk to her. She called me drunk on Sunday night and told me the whole ""this has nothing to do with anything you've done, this is on me... I have issues sometimes with communicating ... blah blah blah."" (The ""it's not you, it's me"" routine from Seinfeld). The conversation was just a few minutes, and I was kind of drunk too (because of Super Bowl Sunday!), so I texted her on Monday a follow up ""would love to continue our conversation"" .. and have yet to receive a response. I understand that we'd only been seeing each other for a few weeks so she owes me nothing - but this one hurts. As I said, we clicked like no other and I just feel like we were at the start of something truly great. We had talked about wanting much of the same things, the ambition to travel, both empathizing that we've been having friend issues, that work was stressful but rewarding, etc. It went on and on. I was starting to trust her and become more affectionate with her in my own heart. I don't know if it's the fact that I invited her over for dinner, or maybe texted her ""good morning"" too many times - but the radio silence is excruciating. I posted my story here on Reddit - and also talked at length about this with my Dad, and I've realized that I cannot wait around and hope that she will come around because that's just not fair to me. I deserve someone who will communicate with me even when it's difficult to. Who knows - it's been only 3 days, so maybe she'll come around. This is the longest we've gone without talking. We'd texted every day from when we first matched online until Sunday. And now nothing for days. I feel like my gut and head say it's curtains, but my heart really wants to keep trying. Maybe send a ""thinking of you, hope you're doing okay"" text. Anything to evoke a response from her. But I just can't. I can't give effort when it's not being reciprocated anymore. The only way is to wait, but not hope. I have to focus my energy on myself and my job and my hobbies. I have a lot going for me and like I said we clicked so I just don't understand what her problem is. To circle back to the beginning, this has been a pattern for me. I've had 1 long-term relationship (11 months) - which fizzled out in a very unspectacular way. We'd just realized we weren't meant for each other. But before my ex, there have been similar situations to the one I'm in now - where I liked someone, and I got too carried away - like Icarus flying too close to the sun. Only to come crashing down with the force of a million broken hearts. This felt different, and it was being reciprocated which is why I let myself get carried away again. Maybe I'm just overreacting and she needs some space to get her mind right. The only thing that will help is time. Time heals all. I just cannot wait until I find my ""wife"". (to be honest after the first date with this girl I texted my friends that she was the one. I guess I was wrong.)

The last girl that I dated I felt put a lot of pressure on me to have sex when I wasn’t ready. I told her about my fear of intimacy after two months of dating and she broke up with me. Is it just a compatibility thing in terms of sexual interest, or is there this universal expectation to have sex after like a month? I would need to know the person for at least 3 months or so and have experienced steps on the way there in terms of kissing, etc before I would feel comfortable. 


Bottom line is I just wanna be myself and not feel pressured to have sex and just vibe with the person. Is that a dealbreaker for the vast majority of people? I assume it depends a lot on the person.

And for someone who doesn’t like competing, especially for the attention of the object of my affections……that gives me even more anxiety to an already anxiety inducing situation.

I recently moved to a foreign country and as soon as I got here I matched with a gorgeous girl on Bumble (this was in December). Anyway we really hit things off well, we both agreed we liked each other however we were never intimate as she said she has issues with that sort of thing, both sexually and emotionally. Which for me is okay, I don’t mind taking things slow.

 We’ve been on 8 dates so far and were planning on going to dance lessons on Saturday (why this is time sensitive) we should’ve been on more but Xmas, covid and exams have gotten in the way. She was speaking about us going skiing next month also which helped confirm her interest 

 Anyway, I really like her presence, being around her makes me very happy. We were getting a coffee today when she springs on me that we’re not exclusive (which I thought  was unsaid). Even though she finds me “very attractive and sexy” and really enjoys the time we spend together. Obviously when she sprung this on me I was so embarrassed, like completely, in the middle of the café.

 She said that the reason for this is that it takes her a long time to “trust someone” which is quite ironic when my trust was quite well shattered there.

 We spoke about it and I literally was so annoyed she didn’t tell me this earlier as where I’m from when you are dating that long these things kind of go unsaid. She knows exactly how I feel about her, but won’t commit to being exclusive. So we went back and forth about this for a while getting nowhere as I was kind of shocked and upset.

We had a lot more to talk about today except she “had to go look at a new bike” which again kind of made me feel worthless as I was in a vulnerable position and needed to speak about this there and then. 

 She then left it completely up to me - either we keep “dating” without exclusivity or I leave . Which I felt was a very unfair ultimatum given I’m head over heels for her.

Women who don t find it naturally or don t feel the need to show romantic affection, how is that working? How are you showing affection? Are there workarounds? How does the dating and your love for a partner goes?
I am asking this because i am dating a girl which told me she is a bit oblivious to romantic cues, that she finds it unatural for her to hold hands etc. She does not initiate romantic gestures, kissing etc. Altough she is proactive in dating and she does not refuse when i initiate holding hands or a kiss on the lips. She also told me that she does not want to talk about ex relationship because of bad memories. 
She told me she does not know yet where our dating is going but still wants to date me ( 1 month and something until know).
My gut tells me she is a bit aromantic and or she had  problems with partners in the past. But i want to research the aspect more maybe i will find something that might help us in the future.
