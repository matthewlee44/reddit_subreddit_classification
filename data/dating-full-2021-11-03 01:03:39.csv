Me(22) and him(26) went on our first date in February of 2021. We hit it off instantly. We started to be exclusive and a month later he got me a promise ring which I still have and I don’t want to let go of. He then moved into my parents place with me and he had his own room because you know parents they don’t want things going on together lol. Anyways things we’re going good for a while then after Easter my mom asked him to move out. A little back story on my mom is she doesn’t keep things back if she’s upset she will let it out and for me it makes my anxiety sky rocket. 

It kinda hurt him and made him upset with her which I understand. It’s their place but it still hurt him as he was doing chores and helping around the house with me. He then bought a engagement ring. It’s absolutely beautiful I never got it but I saw pictures and I was in love with it. 

My ex worked for his uncle for a period of time and thought his uncle was going to give him the route because my ex was a distributor to stores but Instead decided to take back the route and left him with no job. He was so heart broken and broke into a deep depression and then soon after he was kinda kicked out of his apartment which hurt him more, his landlord wanted to sell the place because of the good market housing has right now.

Our relationship began to get worse and in august we broke up. I feel like I did stress him out so much because I wanted to marry him so badly and wanted to be with him forever. 

I started the no contact for a month as I read and we recently have been talking again. I’ve been focusing on myself and got a promotion at my job and I’m looking to move out of my parents place to an apartment. Something to add is I have a son and he was very involved with my ex and loves him to death. He talks about my ex all the time telling people that he is moving out with me and it breaks my heart. This relationship isn’t something to throw away and not do I want it to be. I love him so much. I’m trying to take things slow with him because I really do want this to last and I feel like we rushed things in the beginning but I would really love to know your guys experience with this type of stuff.

So, there’s this guy I went a date 3 weeks ago. It was really great and we both enjoyed it. We were talking since then, and so far there’s no second date plan or flirting yet. I tried to flirt a few times, but he specifically ignored those texts and changed the subject everytime. But then, few days after the date, he told me we are friends now and he definitely wants to get to know me better before we go into a relationship. I found out he even updated his dating profiles with new photos and answer prompts. And though we are talking everyday, most of those are dry-texting cuz he’s bad at texting. So, I tried to end the convo with a yes or no reply or a sticker to see if he still wants to talk. Then, he always start the conversation again. And I got to know from a mutual friend that he’s still going for dates. Is it completely normal? Does it mean he has no interest in me anymore? I really like him and I’m kind of the type who only talks to one guy at a time. I don’t know when to move on and if my mentality is ready for it. All my close friends told me flirting is completely fine in talking stage esp if we have known each other for like a month, and him going for multiple dates atm is not a good sign for me yet we are exchanging text everyday. I tried to let go of him several times during the past few days, but ended up replying to all his msgs and even talking more. But he seems he doesn’t even excited by my texts. Though i replied instantly most of the times, his replies became late and late. Idk if that text exchange could lead to next level or not.

He’s her older brother and we got along great right away. I felt instantly attracted to him. He’s really one of the most handsome guys I’ve ever met. And he’s a lot different from the type of guy I’ve dated in the past.

We talked from time to time over the last few months and last week we kissed for the first time. I invited him to a Halloween party Saturday night and we slept together after the party. I’ve been single since April and have gone on a few dates since. I did have one hook up back in July with a guy but it left me feeling really unfulfilled. Not only sexually but in every other way. I swore to myself I wasn’t going to do that again and the next guy would be someone I really cared about.

Now here’s Jason who I find to be really attractive but also he seems like a good guy. He’s funny, hard working and he seems to have his shit together unlike some of the guys I’ve met since I’ve been single. And we seem to have great chemistry. Every time we’ve been together we’ve had such a good time. So yeah I slept with him but I’ve felt this amazing chemistry with him and I was sure he felt it too.

Since Saturday night we’ve been texting pretty much nonstop. Earlier this evening he asked me if I’d like to get together Saturday and of course I said yes. So he told me about a place he’d like to try for dinner and I responded “Sounds good! It’s a date!” He hasn’t responded to that yet. When we’ve texted these last few days he’s always responded to me within minutes of me texting him something.

Am I reading too much into it? I mean I did enjoy myself with him last Saturday night but I’m definitely looking for more from him than just being like friends with benefits. I had an arrangement like that with a former coworker last year and while it was fun it also left me ultimately unfulfilled. I was planning on having this talk with him Saturday and telling him that I look at him as a great guy and I’m interested in him as a guy I want to date and not just someone to hook up with. Don’t get me wrong I’m not asking this guy to marry me this weekend or something but I’d like for us both to be on the same page when it comes to this thing we have going on right now.

One night we accidently got on the topic of exes, he was saying how his ex would be his best friend and they broke up cause of covid but he didn't wanna accept her offer to stay friends cause he still had feelings, He said he ''briefly thought about her and got a bit sad'' while he was with me. They had been together **6 months** and it had been **more than a year** since they broke up, they were long distance too. He also mentioned I looked identical to her best friend which made me feel really weird about everything. And I started to question him if he was really over her, he had to think about it, texted me few hours later saying he didn't realise it but he wasn't over her. He was very apologetic and I'm glad he told me but I'm not sure what to do.

I called him one night to clear some things up, he expressed that he wanted something like what they had, but he wanted to move on and be able to make new connections. The last thing he said was something on the lines of ''Y'know what I'm gonna work this out, I'm gonna go to a psychologist and me and you are gonna go far''. We haven't talked for a few days and its been making me anxious.

I've found myself a bit more hurt then I thought and I really want things to work out with us, but I'm not sure if I'd be making a big mistake and leading myself to more hurting. Should I be patient and see what happens or is this a situation where I should move on?

I was walking and she randomly said "" Uh are you in my philosophy class?"" Since I've never really interacted with anyone at school, I quietly answered yes then continued my walk, until I stopped on my 2nd step and realized that she wanted to initiate a convo. So I turned back and started talking to her.

2 days later, I see her in the metro again and I rush towards her to talk to her. We end up having a convo where I asked too many questions and I was way too enthusiastic (I'm awkward af irl)

Next class, she comes to me and asks me if she can sit next to me. I accept and since that day, we've been walking to the metro together twice per week.

She'd even say comments during class while the teacher's talking, like ""sight..I'm tired"" or ""I don't understand anything"" and I'd just go ""haha"".

Luckily, I've asked for her insta and did some research and she has a pic with a guy from 4 months ago and on his page, they have a pic at the beach together from 2 years ago.

I'm kinda confused as to why she approached me. Does she just wanna be friends? Cuz if this guy's her boyfriend, would he be okay if he saw his girl and I walking together?

Our class is dominated by girls, so she wouldn't find it hard to make female friends. Maybe it's because we're the only black people in our class.

Or am I just overthinking?

Okay so the story starts about 6 years ago, I was waiting tables at a country club as a part time job during the summer and I was engaged at the time so I was locked down among like 10 other women, whatever. Anyway one girl, showed interest in me and I shot it down repeatedly, because I wanted to be faithful to my fiancée and you know responsibility. Everything worked out fine, no issues, told my girl about the situation and handled it well, quit that job later that summer since school was getting back in. Life progresses normally. 
Fast forward 6 years later, divorced because she cheated, and it’s been about 5 months and things are progressing nicely, processing my own emotions as I go etc etc. I’m on Bumble one day and see her profile, I then proceed to get a wild hair up my ass and go find her on fb and message her “anon, why are you on bumble” she messages back and we catch up, I say we should hangout, to which she responds I’d love to but her schedule is crazy because she has kids but she says you can come over one night after the kids are asleep and we can watch a movie or something. Okay cool, go over to her house yesterday and you can feel the tension because we had been flirty in messages and Snapchat, so I knew she at least dug me. Anyway, we’re sitting on her couch and I see and feel her moving closer to me while we’re watching this movie, so eventually I pause the movie and just go in for the kiss, success, she reciprocates, very well might I add and we chatted on and off during the movie, stopping occasionally to kiss more, things got kind of hot and heavy at one point where I was on top of her and she said she didn’t want to rush things like she had in the past, which I was more than on board with. Keep watching movie and sitting right by each other, she’s super affectionate like holding my arm, laying her leg on me, the whole shebang. When the movie ends, I have to leave to go catch up on some school work, when I leave guys, she kisses me like she missed me, like I don’t know how to describe it other than she was just super sweet and affectionate about it even to the point of giving me those horrifically cheesy Eskimo kisses, and I’m just like what is happening to me?

So I spent a couple nights with a girl and we slept together.  She stayed over a couple nights.  I caught feelings.  She knew I was into her because my friends told her.  She was sending some signals so I went with it.

6 days later she texts me.  Invites me to Friendsgiving but says we should hang again before that.  I of course asked her when we can hang out again and when’s a good time.  I tell her she’s welcome to stay over again (she lives an hr away).  It’s been like 6 hours and she hasn’t responded:(.

My friends say I should have came out with a time/place out the gate and been “alpha.”  I really despise all these games but it’s been like 6 hours so maybe they’re right.

How do you all put up with all the uncertainties?  I’m way too forward/straight shooting to deal with this.  

She just got out of a relationship so I’m sure that’s at play.  But still, I feel like if I don’t say the right thing I come off as desperate.  I like this girl a lot but trying to just “be cool” feels like shit.

Well, let’s just say normally I’m shy and more reserved, but I thought I’d try it out. After all, what do I have to lose, right? 

Now I will admit that I’m not into witty pick up lines or sexting or anything like that, so maybe that’s my problem right there?? BUT, if I come across a match’s profile that I’m quite interested in, I’ll normally say something like:

“Hi! Just dropping in to say I think you’re really cute!”

Or something else of that nature. Sometimes they’ll message back, sometimes not. 

So I guess I’m asking: is my first message too bland? Guys, if a potential match messages you with something like that, how would you respond? Would you be interested in talking to that person, or is the message just too boring?

I said I don't, but to be honest I didn't  sleep well last night because I was thinking about it, I just can't believe it. She's in her 2nd year in college, and I'm the one who's paying for everything, so I'm really really close to her. Now I feel like I need time to process everything, I wanted her to be straight because I'm a closeted gay, and I know how hard it is to be judged by other people, which is by the way very ridiculous. Now I'm questioning my own family, are we an abomination? And wishing that both me and my sister are straight so it will be easy for us to live a normal life. 

I'm also thinking that she's just confused because she's still young, and maybe she'd end up marrying a guy in the future. I don't know, I'm just don't really know what to do. I want to tell her that I don't like it that she's dating a girl, but I also don't want to hurt her feeling. I'm thankful that she told me, but also I wish that she didn't.

We started talking through Instagram and have been talking for five months now. But I have known him for like 4 years but he is friends with two of my close friends, like they used to talk about him sometimes when we met but I have never paid attention to it at all. But I don’t know what happened I was talking to one of my friend and somehow his topic came up and I was instantly attracted about everything that she was telling me about him (June starting). So I made the first move and reached out to him on Instagram and started talking. In the beginning it was only about replying to each other’s story and later I have meet him for the first time was in Mid July with the two of my close friends for a birthday brunch. I tried talking to him but he didn’t talk that much, my friend told me that he is very introvert (one of the two friends that I went to meet him was my best friend and the other friend didn’t know that I liked him or that we text on insta at all). 

Fast forward to mid of august, I went out for drinks with a different group of friends and one of them knew this guy that I was talking to, and kind of called his friend to make sure he was single and not in any relationship. Than that night he texted me on Instagram and than we spoke on call for sometime, ever since than we have been talking everyday. Sometimes we would flirt with each other through texting, but we didn’t talk on call that much.

Fast forward again to 2nd September, I got really drunk and called him and started asking what are we ?? Like are we friends or this casual ?? And I kind off told him that I didn’t kiss anyone before or been in a relationship for that matter, this is what I remember telling him. Even when I called him in the next morning he didn’t tell me what I told him last night. But we continued text like everything is normal. 

It was hard for us to meet because we both stay in different cities, and he would come home for vacations. Finally when he was back in the city, we met alone for the first time and went for a drive for almost 2 hrs, I had to sneak out at night around 11 to meet him. We ended up kissing that night, and we kind off agreed that this whole thing is casual. So in the one month that he was in the city, we have only met three times, this was mostly because he had an internship and I was out of station for a while. So the last time we met, it kind off went beyond kissing but not sex. He dropped me off as soon as we stopped making out.

And the day after that he went back to college. I like him more and I don’t want this to be casual thing, but I don’t know how I should tell him that. I tried talking to him once through text, but he told me that he was not ready for a relationship at the moment but may be in future (this was mostly because we started talking in the first time after he just broke up  with his ex). And we haven’t been the texting that much. I don’t know what to do. I really like him a lot. I have never liked anybody so much so that it hurts. 

Also inserting the texts that I have sent him while trying to figure out what the whole this is 

Me: Arey I’m not sure if it’s a good time to talk about this but I have to get it out of me. I know we both wanted to keep things casual and I don’t even know why I feel like telling you this but I thought you should know about it. When we met for the first time personally, we did agree mutually that it is going to be casual and I too  wanted to have a good time but these past two days I have been thinking and it made me realise that I like you as a person, and now you have started to mean something to me. And I don't exactly know how you feel for me, and honestly I don't know how to go about it at this point. Even if you've dropped hints about this, I'm not sure I've read them correctly -.- I thought of calling you and telling you about this, but you already know that I don’t have the guts to do it except when I’m drunk😂  Honestly, I feel clueless as to how we should go about this, and since we might not be able to meet, I am just confused. And if this comes to an end then I sincerely hope that it wouldn’t be awkward for us in the future.. And also I wanted to know what you think about this before whatever we decide? I want to know what’s going on in your head because it’ll make things easier for the both of us and if not then I understand

Him : I understand your problem dude but I’m not ready for a relationship not now atleast maybe in future. If you’re feeling uncomfortable we can stop talking
But I like you 
Nothing will be awkward 
But not anything for now 
I’m not even ready 

Me : See even I don’t want to be in a relationship right now, but maybe in future. I just wanted to talk to you about this, because since we would not be meeting for some time, I just wanted to know how we would go about this. I don’t feel awkward with you at all, I just texted you because I wanted to know if you genuinely liked me, or if it was mostly casual

When I went canvassing last week, I met a really cool girl who I have a lot in common with. We vibed and we randomly found out we were both born in the same city and went to college right by each other across the country! She even met another candidate I had worked with in college. She mentioned she had a friend who went to my college and I looked him up later and it turns out we have a lot of mutual friends!

Basically, we are going to be continuing this canvassing/organizing effort for a while and I am actively involved in this organization. We intend to do this work weekly for several months so I just want to make sure I do this right. Next week, I'm bringing my friend who's visiting me for the week to the canvass so I'm considering inviting this girl to eat lunch with us after the canvass cause it'd be low pressure with another female friend there. I am also involved in another exciting informational campaign with this organization and I am considering inviting this girl to join our campaign cause I think she lives in the neighborhood.

I guess what I would love to hear from Reddit is what is the best etiquette for expressing interest in someone you are doing longer term organizing with? I would obviously like to hang out with her at least once or twice outside of the group canvassing (since there's not a lot of time to talk aside from some minutes at the end) to assess the vibe, but I just don't want to make it awkward. Since I am also actively involved in this organization, I am worried that if I invite her to different things and integrate her into our relatively small neighborhood campaign and then ask her out, it might get slightly awkward.

She said sure sounds great. But has since became kind of distant. I think I may have upset her by not letting her choose.

The reason I didn't want to go to the movies was because I had an inner ear disorder that makes loud sounds painful to my ear. I don't know if I should tell her that or just keep it to myself?

There's this girl that I've been talking to for about 3 months... she tells me so much about her personal life. She usually texts me when she's drunk and I get mixed signals all the time because I guess I'm Just dense... and she has a boyfriend may I mention... I told her do you think we could be anything more than friends and she said possibly... but that's when she was drunk.

I've never been in a relationship. I know I'm playing with Dangerous Waters, but I'm an extremely emotional guy, and it's very hard for me to hide my feelings. It feels like I'm being used for emotional support. Like I'm still a virgin, but I'm not looking for anything like that (even though it would be nice)... but that's the last thing on my mind. All I want is a true connection I've never had it with anyone.

I feel like such a fool for believing anything now... I never had my heart broken but this is what I imagine it would feel like. Am I a fool?

IDK Maybe ""being used"" with the wrong words to say... because she talks to me when she's sober too and even when she's at work. Like she'll give me compliments on how I look and she'll call me a gem, and say ""I'm different"". and yeah I'm very happy when she messages me I smile all the time when she does.

I always told myself that alcohol is the truth serum... it's like why would she say we could possibly be more than friends when she has a boyfriend already? And I gave her a Cheesy compliment and she said she thought it was ""smooth"" (but that's when she was drunk). Not to mention she also told me her tarot card said her relationship isn't going to last much longer. That fucked me up.

Should I forget about it? Or it is there any hope or, should I just continue a platonic relationship with her?

Her friend and I do both have Facebook. and i kinda told my sister this, gut it was in a jokingly non-serious voice...and at least from that, my sister didnt seem to have a problem with me possibly dating her friend

anyways I want to ask her out through Facebook messenger, but i just don't know how to go about in doing so.

We’ve talked about getting more serious and I am planning on asking her to be my girlfriend soon. Where things have become a bit complicated is I am having some anxiety with vetting her and her family/ friends in regards to a relationship. I’ve met all of them, I’ve talked to them and they seem like great, healthy, normal people. I have gotten along with them well in the time I've spent with them and the quantity has been decent so far. Maybe this is just something for my therapist and I to talk about, but are there any other ways or other means to be able to vet these people and the potential relationship that is here?

I have strong feelings for this girl and she is remarkable, but the thing is, my last relationship did not end well. I was left with the trauma bond of all trauma bonds and I had to go to some extreme lengths not only to break it, but to also get answers to a lot of things and finally be left alone. I was accused of so much shit by ex that had never even come up while together and she never once acknowledged so much shit that she did. We were supposed to move in together and possibly get married. What is so unnerving and where a lot of my anxiety stems from is I spent a lot of time with my ex and it was only six months in where I really only began to see the extent of mental illness and issues of her family. The four of them have enough mental illness to rival One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. Just by proxy, her mother alone caused so many issues, too. My ex herself and her mom are both covert narcissists and my ex either withheld very pertinent information I should’ve been made aware of, or flat out lied about so much, whether to me or to others about myself. Easter with these people consisted of several hours around a bonfire with maybe a total of a whole hundred words spoken. There is so much, especially at the end of things that absolutely blew my mind. My ex even encouraged me to take an SSRI that had extreme negative side effects that far outweighed any positive affect and was telling me I needed to up the dosage even more. I only just managed to fully get off it recently. 

All in all, I felt like I was left akin to a top on a table, spinning and spinning until everything was just a blur. These people negatively impacted me in ways I had never dealt with by anyone else before. The end result was being left with someone as myself I didn’t even recognize anymore and the toxicity of these people was the catalyst. Something I have noticed to a painful degree with them and others is how the trauma of others, whether generational or relational, effects others and creates loops and tracks that can be very hard to get out of, that is even if you are able to. I felt like for a good amount fo time I had inherited their insanity and I can’t get stuck in another trauma bond with another girl or their deficient family. I am determined not to end up a byproduct like they are of past events or eventually wind up in a tract of life like the one they occupy in their existence. While the girl I am seeing has been very helpful and supportive and knows of what has transpired with this ex and what not, there was a time too when I saw my ex as otherwise of what she is, and hell, the same even went for her mother. You can spend insane amounts of time with someone and still not even really know them until they choose to reveal themselves.

On paper, this girl I am seeing and those around her are good. In person, from what I can see they are good as well and they like me, too. There are not any of the red flags or weird things with them that there was in my last relationship as I’ve noticed. In some ways, like inviting me in to their home and to spend time with them, or in even having connections to their extended family, they’ve been the complete opposite. But, still. Is there anything more I can do? Is there anything I should watch for? I cannot stress enough how desperate I am to avoid another situation where only after nearly eleven months of intense trauma with a subpar group of people and some serious therapy did I realize just how fucked things had been in relation to them.

Lets call him Matt for privacy. Matt and I had such deep conversations and a strong connection that we both acknowledged, he would say things to me such as “he wanted to be with me for a long time and give me the world”, that I have qualities of what he imagines his future wife to be, i’m “the one”, he loves me beyond words can explain, etc.  

Matt recently lost a parent due to an illness right before I met him, and during our situationship I tried my best to be of absolute love and support for him. I shared stories with him about a loved one my family lost 3 years ago, and gave him my best advice and inspiring stories. I wanted to be a should for him to cry on, and let it out. No forcing toxic positivity, nothing if that sort 

We are both university students at the same school, (we are from the same state, he lives about 50 mins away tho). He is so strong and is continuing his education and part time job still, although just recently losing a parent. I always made sure to remind him of how incredible he is and how brilliant what he his doing is because I want him to feel so proud of himself. I wanted to bring him nothing but happiness in his hard time. 

His program is very difficult and requires a lot of work. After we met up for the first time, the next day he told me that he didn’t want to lose me but was feeling super overwhelmed with school and work, plus coping with grief and the trauma regarding the loss of a parent. He said we should hold off on a relationship label until everything settles down for him. I understood, I want to take everything at his own pace so that he feels comfortable and doesn’t feel rushed/stressed. 

His responses to me after that conversation started getting slower, the calls became less frequent although nothing between our relationship really changed. We still talked and laughed like we used to. I never bothered him about it, because in what world would i have a right do i have to do that. 

Just over two weeks ago, was the last time I texted him.

He didn’t answer, and hasnt texted or called me since. He no longer views my social media stories and no longer likes my posts even though he is always active on there. He is now acting like I don’t exist. I don’t know what I did, I always tried to be a positive support system in his life. 

He does not owe me reciprocation of affection just because I gave it to him. But, I just don’t know what suddenly happened. 

Embarrassing to admit, but I was convinced we were soulmates. I still dream about him at night. I can’t stop thinking about him. I feel so confused and hurt. I don’t know why he didn’t give me an explanation. I can assume it’s because he’s going through a lot right now, but he usually is the type of person to be upfront and talk about things. So i don’t know

I don’t want to call him or text him because I know there is clearly a reason why he is ignoring me and I don’t want to overwhelm him.

Although he has ghosted me, I would be thankful just knowing I made a positive impact in his life, even if it was for a short while. 

I feel as though I do deserve better, or at least an explanation. He knows doing this would hurt me and i really don’t think he cares

Hope you’re all doing good, I’m just so confused on what to do on this situation. So I’ll give you the back story. It’s a very long one so just hear me out .I am a 20 year old female and this guy is 21. We were bestfriends the first 2 years of high school and we were really close with eachother. I had no feelings for him during those first 2 years but he did have feelings for me during those first 2 years , he told me in the first year of us meeting but I said I didn’t have any feelings for him and that we could remain friends . So we stopped talking for a bit but then got back to being friends and I started developing feelings for him as I got to know him more so at the end of sophomore year in high school we started dating. Everything was going really good , he was the sweetest , he said I love you first  it was so soon but I guess I understood since he had feelings for me for 2 years i guess it could develop into love during that time frame and I didn’t love him yet but after the first 4 months I ended up saying I love you back and things were going good , there was no issueeee . We communicated well and we got along really well and we’d have the funnest time together and we got even closer 

. Then around the 6 month mark my mom got very controlling and she said that I couldn’t go Over his house every week anymore and that we already see eachother at school so you know we were still able to hang out sometimes but not as much as we used to and he would get mad about that he’d be like I only get to hang out with you like twice a week so that became a problem But we were still mostly good . Then around the 8 month mark he started being distant with  me . He just wouldn’t talk to me as much as he used to and he seemed kinda down so I would try to ask him what’s wrong and he wouldn’t tell me he would just say that he’s just busy and that hes okay . But I felt like we were drifting and then I found out that a girl who we both knew that she liked him , was texting him and they were talking back and forth and I looked at the messages and they weren’t flirting but I still didn’t like the fact that he was talking to a girl that liked him . He swore they were on friends so I said okay whatever and then around the 10 month mark  he said he wanted a break . 

He said it was because he was tired of my mom not letting us spend much time together and not being able to see me often . He said that when we’re older we could have much more freedom and that he wants me then , when we’re older . I thought that was a bull reason so I said just tell me that you’re losing feelings if that’s what’s going on here Bc you’ve been distant and he said that he’s not losing feelings that he still loves me but we don’t get to spend time together and we are restricted anyways it was a 2 week break and then he broke up with me for the same reasons that He just said . 

But he was  till talking to me after we broke up and I was heart broken , then I found out that’s he was hanging out with the girl that liked him and texted him while  we were dating and a month later they started dating . I was even more heartbroken yet he would still talk to me and I would still talk to him Bc I didn’t wanna let him go . He would still tell me that he cares about me and that he wants to be with me in the future . Anyways they dated for a year or two and the whole time we were still talking to eachother but not in a flirty way at all and during all this time I still had feelings for him and it made me feel so hurt that he had someone else and I would always get confused why he was still talking to me 

. He said it’s bc he didn’t wanna lose me and he cares about me and that we’ve always been bestfriends before we became anything and that he still wants me in the future . Anyways then they broke up and he came to me and we started doing sexual things but not dating and i still had feelings for him so it hurt but i also felt like I was slowly getting him back . That went on for months until I was like wtf am I doing waiting around for him to want me and i feel so stupid for still talking to him Bc i been wayyy too nice and felt taken advantage of so I told him all this and I blocked him and he was crying and it’s been 4 months now and suddenly 2 days ago I get a message on my phone from his email and he was  saying hi how have you been and I said im good how’s are you and he began  saying how he wanted  to call to explain everything  

so I said fine and I unblocked his number . He was crying on the phone Saying he’s so sorry for hurting me  and that I’ve always been important to him and that he knows he messed up by dating someone so soon and that he still wasn’t Over me at the time he just felt like he couldn’t actually  have a  close quality relationship with me Bc of my mom and that’s why he wanted me when we’re older and that’s he got with her as a distraction after the.break up and that he still kept talking to me Bc he didn’t wanna lose me and he still cared about me Bc we were best friends before any of this and he also said that the majority of their relationship was her arguing about me and being jealous of me and that’s caused her to flirt with other guys to get back at him for talking to me and their relationship was toxic and the whole time he was thinking about me and they broke up then he went to do things  with me  which I don’t understand why he didn’t just want to date me but he said it’s Bc he had just gotten out of that  relationship

When I met my now boyfriend we had a casual relationship that was mostly about sex, I remember the first weeks we dated all we did was have sex, eat a nice diner and watch a movie. We broke things off 1 month after dating non stop because we wanted different things (I wanted a relationship and he wanted something casual) and then we re-encountered 3 months after, became friends and then he asked me to be his gf. This time around he told me, he realized how much he enjoyed being with me (which I do too) and how he feels very attracted to me in everyway and well, now we are a couple. This is when the sexual stuff went on decline.

We have stopped having sex completely, the last time we did was 2 months ago and the last time before that was 1 month before. And so on. When we first lasted 1 month without sex I asked him what was going on and he told me he is aware that he has “trust issues” and that he feels like everytime things get too serious with a girl his libido goes completely down. He asked for patience and I gave it to him.. but now is getting worse. 

We party and have lots of fun and drink and what not and when we get home I’m always all horny and get rejected by him which makes me feel sooo undesirable. I comfronted him again and he says that maybe is the age difference, that I’m in my 20’s and he is close to his 40’s, but this just makes no sense taking in count that when we had a casual relationahip he couldn’t leave my clothes on. I’m a very sexual person and this is killing me. I have comfronted him 3 times already, the last time was 3 weeks ago, and I was very firm this time I told him he either goes to a doctor to get this fixed or I wasn’t gonna be able to stay in the relationship for much longer. He felt scared about losing me, I guess, and he said he’ll make an appointment but takes forever to get one (we live in a country that supposedly has one of the best social rights/public health insurances , but to get a doctors appointment takes even months).

My boyfriend is the sweetest guy, we have fights here and there and of course he is not perfect, but most of the time we make things work. He is the best boyfriend I’ve ever had… but sometimes I’m afraid this is turning into a friendship. We hadn’t been together as a couple for even a year and we barely have sex, I’ve gained some weight after being with him (I feel like he takes me on cute dates to compensate for the lack of sex and for that reason I’ve been eating a lot!) I feel so undesirable, specially cause he tells me is not a problem about getting it up, is just that he doesn’t feel like it… I’ve tried eveeything, sexy underwear, playful things, dr*gs … nothing works and what makes it worse for me is that he can’t get his hands of me, we are always kissing , hugging, cuddling, holding hands, he tells me I’m beautiful all the time, we literally feel very in-love. if anyone sees us in the street, being so physical all the time, they would assume our sex life is great, but it is almost non-existent. I can’t believe I have less sex in a relationship than when I was single, I used to hook up with guys every 2 weeks from dating apps… I even have guys hitting me up from back then, inviting me over and I don’t really wanna do it, I want MY boyfriend to f*ck me and leave me breathless, but I’m not getting that and it’s making me so sad. 

Have any of you guys experimented this trust issue situation where you or your parent has no libido? Is it a real thing? What can be done? Or does anyone think is something else? How can we handle this while we wait for the doctora appointment?

I usually have no problem getting a girl attracted to me, but whenever I get attracted to a girl, I get a glimmer of hope because I know I'm good enough to be someone's SO. The problem is, when a girl admits their feelings to me, I get attached, due to knowing both of us have feelings. The problem is, I usually get played a lot. I don't think every girl is the same. I've never thought that, because it's just not logical. Out of 7 billion people, I've only dated a few, so how the hell would I have the right to say everyone is the same?

Anyway, back to the point. A lot of girls who've shown interest usually take advantage of my understanding nature, which is a disaster because I'm always optimistic that everyone is different, making me easily vulnerable to manipulation. I hate it because it gets me insecure. I know I have worth, but I also get so discouraged when I catch feelings because of the way I've been treated.

I know that years 1/2 are very different from rotations on years 3/4 and from residency as well, but it's obvious that I'm gonna be busy asf all the time. I honestly have had pretty limited serious dating experience, mostly hookups and one/two month flings w/ potential that never evolved into anything long term.

For current students, residents, or practicing physicians: how did dating work? Did you date in med or out of med? How did you balance your workload with spending time w/ your SO, and how did the dynamic change as you went from the talking stage to the comfortable stage? What were dates like? For the clingy and affectionate guys/girls, how did you manage it?? For those that didn't date at all and have now graduated, have you found success afterwards?

For people who dated med students: what was the experience like? What advice could you give to a prospective student like me that would allow me to make relationships work out easier? I'm sure things like constant communication and sharing schedules help, so lmk if I'm right! 

I know I'm still super young but it's something that's been weighing on my mind for a while. I've always wanted to be in a committed relationship but for whatever reason it just never worked out. I honestly just feel like having that emotional support and sharing that affection, being there for someone and having them be there for you would be a crazy nice feeling.

Met a girl on Tinder, we both go to the same college. I asked what she was looking for, she said she didn’t know. We got coffee, it went really well. We texted a few days until the second date. I picked her up, we got dinner and she mentioned she was blushing the entire meal, so I invited her to walk by a local river. She said yes and we held hands while walking. Afterwards I gave her the option to come to my place and she was enthusiastic about it. We watched a movie and made out for a minute then she mentioned watching another movie the next time she comes over, then we cuddled. 

I went to kiss her again and she wasn’t too into it so we stopped and shortly after, I could feel the vibe was off and she said she was tired and asked me to take her home. On the ride back she was quiet until she apologized for just being tired. I dropped her off and it was clear she wasn’t wanting a goodbye kiss. Sent a text when I got home, and she replied dry. In the morning she told me she had fun hanging out and talking but needs to just focus on school at this point but I'm really great and to not take it personally. 

But after it was going so well, it’s hard to not wonder what I did wrong. I feel there’s always room to improve myself but I’m not sure what caused such a drastic change out of nowhere?

We talked a few times with one of the times being an hour and I got her number. Texted back and forth and she agreed to a date, but our schedules didn't line up. She even attempted to reschedule. Well, some events happened in between like her hanging out in the pool with me for two hours with a buddy and me sending a somewhat cringe text to her that came off as needy even though that wasn't even what drunk me had in mind. Basically, after a few days since the text I had invited her to three potential dates although I wasn't extremely clear about them being dates, but talking to other woman they said she would know my intentions. She said she was busy for all of them. Now, that is something I actually believe. Always run into her getting home from work, getting ready for volleyball, volunteer work, etc, etc. She is busy. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that text I gave her some space and it slowly started back up where we were texting a few times back and forth a day with her initiating multiple times. Our interactions face to face were always friendly and she would always take light hearted jabs at me. But a few days ago something strange happened. She initiated about a potential creeper in our apartment complex. I made a light joke about it and we went back and forth about how women have a 6th sense for weird guys and how I knew that due to my twin sister. She said the guy wouldn't know her first name unless he was checking mail or asking around. I mentioned she put her full name in my phone and even then I said I would find it extremely creepy if I went out to try to find and add her social media. She replied with a ""hahhahahaah"" and the next message regarding my twin sister was left on read. After 24 hours I sent a follow up assuming maybe she read and forgot about the text heading to work. Follow up was about information I knew about the guy that may be a creeper. It has been around five days and it's still stuck on ""delivered"". So I took that as a sign and haven't texted since. 

We ran into each other, which almost seemed intentional (long story) on her behalf a night ago and she was extremely friendly and was showing me photos of her halloween events. So I was a little confused, but so be it. Still haven't texted. What I want to know is should I just entirely ignore her or be upfront about my initial intentions and leave the ball in her court? I'm probably buying a house in a few months and will be moving out and even if there is a 0.1% chance of her being interested I don't want to just leave it at me hanging my hat up and calling it a day. Thought the next time I ran into her I could say something along the lines of:

""Hey, I want to preface this with I'm not looking for an answer from you. I found your personality interesting and wanted to get to know more about you and asked you on a few dates. Sadly they didn't work out. I enjoy texting you and talking to you face to face, but for the last few weeks I've treated it as just friendly chat and I had no underlying intentions with talking to you. I just want to throw the ball your way and let you know that I'm still interested and if you come around to maybe wanting to grab a drink or food you have my number so just let me know. I will just assume that any conversation, in person or over text, without a date being lined up is just being friendly from here on out and treat it as such.""

My ex had two kids and we had a  mutual pet, so it always felt like I lost 3 people and a pet (which I loved deep from the heart) in the break up. I didn't really got to say goodbye for the kids. And I miss the pet every day. In fact, just typing that makes me feel bad, so it is something I am still emotionally dealing with. We were together about 4 years and we had lots of difficulties in our relationship, so the break felt like inevitable.   


I (28y old, btw) have been dating through Tinder for about 7 months, trying to find connection. This is the first time I am dating and I really haven't seen this much women in my life in such a short timespan so I am a bit overwhelmed and you could say, a bit addicted too. But it hurts so much that it is almost devastating; I can't commit. I am deeply emotional person so this whole dating thing takes so much energy from me and I am afraid of hurting myself or somebody else. My friend told a nice analogy: watch out, because you can burn your fingers pretty fast, and it is likely to happen for either you or the one you are dating. And that is so true. I / we connect emotionally, go physical, I feel like it is not enough and then I just try find someone ""more interesting"". Am I broken? Do human beings work like this?

This morning I woke up from my dates home and I just wanted to leave. It doesn't mean that I do not like her, I really do, but I was just sick of myself feeling the way I feel. I feel like a cheater and it feels awful to look in her eyes, because I have or may have another interest tomorrow. In fact, I have had that problem with every woman's eyes who I have been connected with past 7 months. Am I chasing the dragon, do I suffer from trauma or what the hell is this, am I gay? I don't fucking know anymore. I haven't really had a real crush through dates over Tinder. I have dated people who are somewhat attractive. I have had chances with really attractive people, but most times I have been too insecure to get anything happening. Maybe I think too much of myself. Maybe I think too little of myself. Maybe I have melted my brains through porn or social media. Maybe I think too much. Maybe I am just shallow person who see people as attractive or un-attractive meatballs. Gonna have kids? Sure, but not with this meatball. Let's have a dinner with friends? Can't hear you from the pocket I put you in. I should be ashamed of myself.

So I've only dated one guy who was my irl best friend since middle school. Since I've been experimenting with what I can do to look more feminine pre-hrt and pre-surgery, as well as also finally experiment more with dating other genders, I've been having a lot of objectifying experiences from men. My experience so far has been limited to reddit and online dating in a few other places, like okcupid, but it tends to be the majority of the men who inbox me who just seem disinterested in getting to know one another. They just want to use me to satiate their libido I guess. 

Is this how it is with men generally? What have your experiences been dating men? The only guy so far I had a good time with is that best friend of mine lmao it seems like anyone who is a stranger either ghosts in the end of is trying to objectify. 

In contrast, well two of my current partners I met through Reddit - neither are men. They actually were interested in getting to know each other, develop a bond, etc. So idk if it really is a Reddit thing since I have a good experience with two non-men from Reddit.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1119183,public,self,"I am a pan polyamorous trans gal, limited in experience with dating men, haven't had a good experience so far online.
