He was a PhD in engineering with a great job, lots of hobbies, loved making us coffee and breakfast in the morning and spending hours talking. He constantly told me how smart, beautiful, gorgeous, talented and wonderful I am. We spoke every day throughout the day, and he adored the sound of my voice. 

We exchanged Christmas gifts and I love yous and stopped using condoms. It was decided that we were serious about each other and that he wanted to be my boyfriend. I was ecstatic, felt so loved and cared for and by someone who I felt the same way about. He would tell me things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so turned on thinking about you as a mom.‚Äù It was in that moment that for the first time I saw myself having a family, something I never thought would happen for someone like me (I‚Äôm a surly, broken, bipolar, highly traumatized cat lady failing at a journalism career in slow motion). 

When I returned home from a family Christmas, I suddenly became very sick with a fever, hallucinations, nausea, vomiting and dizziness. I thought it must be COVID, so my boyfriend sent food to me while I was in isolation. He also rode his bike all the way to me in Queens from Manhattan to bring a heavy package up the stairs, even though I insisted that was ridiculous and that I would just pay whoever delivered my Uber eats to do it. He just wanted to see me and be near me and hear my voice. 

The following Tuesday, I felt a weird tingling in my mouth and on my genitals. It was herpes. While there‚Äôs no telling who gave it to whom, it‚Äôs pretty convenient that I would get my first-ever STD two weeks after starting condom less sex with my ex boyfriend. 

When I called to tell him, I was crying and expected him to be upset and break up with me. But he didn‚Äôt, he said it was not a big deal and that he had a special feeling for me. I felt so secure about the relationship when he said this and thought to myself how lucky I was to have a loving partner to support me through HSV-1. 

Fast forward to Sunday, he made plans to take me on an adventure to Coney Island. We had a really fun day, took pictures together, and things seemed fine. But two days later, I received the most insane phone call in my recent memory. 

He called to tell me that threesomes I had in the past, which I told him about on the train to CI, ‚Äúscared‚Äù him and that his ex girlfriend from Germany was going to come live with him and they are going to get back together. 

To say that I‚Äôm devastated would be an understatement. This was the first serious relationship I had in years. Every man I meet treats me like a throwaway. I have no idea what to do with myself, I am hurt, angry, depressed and see this as confirmation that I‚Äôm unlovable.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1154969,public,nsfw,Instantaneously devalued and dumped after my boyfriend learned about my past sexcapades,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sdoup3/instantaneously_devalued_and_dumped_after_my/,no_ads,0.0,,,,

So I recently went on a first date with a guy from an app. We had been speaking since New Year, had great chemistry and attraction. The date went pretty well, and I proceeded to do something I almost never do‚Ä¶kiss on the first date (no judgement, just a preference). Not a peck, a full blown, all out, tongue tie kiss. Not once, a few times at the end of the date. There was a lot of chemistry.

Two days later, my throat started feeling tingly‚Ä¶it got progressively worse and more painful, shock horror‚Ä¶I had developed tonsillitis! (Definitely not Covid‚Ä¶tested to check)

I spoke to him about it, he seemed to think it was mere coincidence. I was somewhat frustrated by this - even my doctor found that to be improbable -I‚Äôve never had tonsillitis before. I assured him multiple times that I didn‚Äôt blame him, it was one of those things, it could be put down to differences in our microbiome etc.

With that said, it‚Äôs been quite painful, I can barely open my mouth, talk, my glands are inflamed, it‚Äôs uncomfortable, disruptive to my work and postgrad schedule etc, and I‚Äôm on meds almost round the clock (4x per day).

We had agreed to meet again that very night, but I‚Äôm feeling rather timid about the whole thing, and can‚Äôt imagine I‚Äôd want to kiss him again, or anyone for quite some time.

Anyways, the question is‚Ä¶would you go on a second date? Am I being unreasonable? Have you experienced anything like this? Would you continue to date him? Would you kiss him again?

TLDR: Got terrible bout of tonsillitis after first date kiss, had already planned second date‚Ä¶but now unsure if I should continue to date said guy. I certainly don‚Äôt feel ready to kiss (him) again. Am I being unreasonable? How would you handle it?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1154972,public,self,Kissed on first date‚Ä¶got tonsillitis!

I met this girl six months ago from my female best friend  and I got her Instagram and I never spoke to her on Instagram or saw her again until two weeks ago. 

I decided to slide up in one of her stories. First story I slide up on was off her and I just put üòçüòçüòç and she replied back ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ and then I slide up to her a story again this time it was about the weekend and we spoke about music/exams  for a week on Instagram but both our replies time was so slow so it wasn‚Äôt a super massive convo during the week it was around roughly  33 message exchanged in a week. 

The last message I sent was I haven‚Äôt seen you in ages want to hangout after exams (if the hangout went good I would have said next time do you want to go on a date at the end) but she suddenly deactivated her account and she Re-Activated it yesterday and I just found out  messages don‚Äôt go through on deactivated account meaning my message didn‚Äôt go through and on her part she‚Äôs replied to everything. 

What should I do? How do I progress things with her? I don‚Äôt feel like I can just re-send it because the momentum is dead now due to her being gone for a week. The only reason I even talked about music was to break the ice barrier (since we are basically strangers) and create some momentum to eventually ask for a hangout but now I feel like asking for a hangout is impossible. The momentum is gone and I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore I don‚Äôt really feel like I can just pop up in the dms like that since we are still strangers unless she post something on her story but even that is so draining since she don‚Äôt post much to begin with.

\- Ghosted after months of seeing each other  
\- Ghosted after sex  
\- Got cheated in a relationship  
\- Abusive relationship

The examples of comments/advices given were:

\- ‚ÄúYou dodged a bullet‚Äù  
\- ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good that you experience now and not later‚Äù  
\- ‚ÄúYou dodged a bomb, imagine if it happened few months later‚Äù  
\- ‚ÄúYou should move on from people like this‚Äù  
\- ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt deserve you‚Äù  
\- ‚ÄúIf they don‚Äôt have the decency to communicate and let you know, they are not gonna be a good partner‚Äù  
\- ‚ÄúThis is a major red flag, you don‚Äôt need someone like this in your life‚Äù

Few weeks/months later, you see them happily dating or engaged to somebody else.  
If they are real red flag or bad/toxic/asshole, you name it, then why do they still deserve to be happy with someone else despite the things they have done to you? They are treating their SO better than how they treated you?

Did we REALLY dodged a bullet though?

Or are we supposed to live with the fact that despite everything right that we‚Äôve done, people are still gonna hurt you, and yet they will still be living a happy life while the rest of us have to deal with grieve and pain.

I currently live in a small, one bedroom apartment about 15 mins from him and he lives in a 2 bedroom apartment in the center of one of the most expensive cities to live in in the US. 

Budget is inconsequential to him, but it is important to me as I am not as wealthy and not where I want to be savings-wise. We have never discussed his finances but he isn‚Äôt phased by what I consider the astronomical rent of his apartment. 

Sheer cost aside, I don‚Äôt think the space is right for us together. We both have a lot of ‚Äústuff‚Äù and even if I get rid of a lot of my things, I don‚Äôt think the space is right for the both of us. I hate clutter. I‚Äôm allergic to dust and there is carpet. Working from home constantly, I realize I need dedicated workspace and lots of light. He takes the second bedroom for his office and the windows are small. I would like space for my peloton and there isn‚Äôt any. We also both value quiet, personal time alone in our own spaces which we respect and it‚Äôs part of what makes us a great match.

His closets are filled with priceless art for his ‚Äúsomeday house he thought he would have by now when he bought them‚Äù which implies he desires more space.

He‚Äôs unwilling to move for two reasons:
1. He doesn‚Äôt think we‚Äôve spent enough time there together (he decided to spend most of the pandemic at his parents‚Äô mansion, where i joined him for months at a time, no questions asked.) and he believes the natural order of things is that I move into his apartment before we decide on a place together.

2. And now that the pandemic is clearing up, he wants to enjoy all the city has to offer with his friends.

Anything outside his exact location, even 10 minutes, is too far.

Thing is, we could get so much more space 10 mins out. Parking! Three bedrooms! A yard! Completely renovated! Bright! All for the same if not less than his current rent.

Both our leases are up at the same time so I thought it would be a great time to find a place to rent that is spacious enough for ‚Äúus‚Äù.


He says we should renew his lease, see how it goes and if I end up hating it, look for a new place to rent together but I‚Äôm anticipating a nightmare. I should maybe note that his place is excellently furnished..,but by his ex.

I  have been rejected my whole life. Every single time I meet a girl that I  like and connect with, I get rejected. These are girls I meet at  school, work, parties, etc. And they are definitely not 10/10s just  regular looking girls.

My hobbies  are cars (racing, track, autocross, mods), snowboarding, fashion,  working out. I have a job, friends (male and female), a very  nice social life, a cool car, my own place (w/ roommates). I   don't  consider myself unattractive at all. I like the way I look and I dress  nice ( don't mean to sound   arrogant at all, it's just how I see  myself) but I've never had a gf.

Women  seem to hate when I approach them,  some  are outright mean to me. Like they seem offended that I had the audacity to say hi or approach them.  And It's not just one or two. It's literally every single one I have  ever shown interest IRL.

All  the advice that it's commonly given to guys I already follow, so I  have   no idea what I'm doing wrong or how to improve myself. With OLD  I got  a decent amount of matches, gone on dates and I've even had sex. But   it never turns into a relationship. I always get ghosted.

At  this point I believe that It's because of my height (5'7). It's the reason OLD worked. Because you can't tell how tall I am, they just see  my face and body. It's not a regular thing but women have messaged me first and asked me out. But it never leads to anything, like they lose interest as soon as they see me in person. I really hate to  think this way but I don't see any other reason.

It  sounds ridiculous to say but I'm sacred to become a bitter person  because of it, or to develop hatred. I'm happy with almost every single  aspect of my life and I'm surrounded by awesome family and friends, but  my dating life is complete shit/non-existent. It's so embarrassing being  asked why I don't have a gf by friends and family.

We then a few nights later had sex and he picked me up and 0 intention he had me sleepover at his apartment, he cuddled me which had never happened before and we watched Netflix the next morning and he took me home. Nothing much happened after that, just both busy but a few weeks later we had sex again. Then about a month later, on the past weekend I went over and we had tried to plan what felt like forever a time to see each other. Before we saw each other we were very often sexting back n forth, and tryna plan. One time he messaged me ‚Äúsome [insert my name] kisses would be so cute rnüòò‚Äù which just really caught me off guard because we don‚Äôt usually talk like that with one another. And then one night when I was about to come over but he then told me he was too tired because of work and didn‚Äôt want me to get upset. And I responded ‚Äúawe yeah ofc I feel that.‚Äù And sarcastically, ‚Äúme be mad lol totally‚Äù and he said ‚ÄúüòÇüòÇhey I see it! Or maybe just an attitude;)‚Äù to which I said ‚Äúnah i think last time I just wanted to stay longer last time, I do got abit of an attitude tho, never with u tho‚Äù an he responded right back ‚Äúawee really?! That‚Äôs cuteüòú‚Äù I know that‚Äôs probably just some typically flirting but it just felt different between us.
Finally I drove to his apartment an I kissed him in the elevator and he told me I was cute with and without a mask. And then when we got to his apartment we were just having a couple conversations whilst me kinda laying with him and laughing, and he said he missed me. And then we finally got down to it. After he came he was super affectionate just planting soft kisses on me. He put on a show just for some background and I payed on his chest for a bit and at one point I felt his eyes on me and I said ‚Äúwhatcha looking at? And he said ‚Äújust appreciating you‚Äù and I laughed and kissed him on the cheek and asked ‚Äúyou missed my [insert name] kisses??‚Äù And he nodded and I kissed him all over his face while giggling and then he just pecked me really softly and then we just laid there. Then he laid on top of me while I gave him head scratches and caressed his back. I watched him fall asleep in like 5 minutes through the mirror he was like a rock, head pressed against my naked chest. Is this just him feeling the comfort of another person? Or could he have some possible feelings? I know this is tricky territory, I just want to know how to navigate. I don‚Äôt wanna ruin the way things are I also don‚Äôt want to hurt myself.

the mature egg out of the 15-20 follicles that was selected for growth and maturity every month in your mom's ovaries

Don't beat yourself up even if someone doesn't see the value of you and doesn't want to date you or break up with you, etc etc.

I am interested in a guy, and I'm not sure if he is in a relationship or not. I'm not close to him, just someone who works at a bar I go to frequently and have taken notice of. I am a bit shy, so I've just kept my distance, but I'm considering approaching him.

However. I feel like he might either have a girlfriend, or be in some sort of relationship. What do I do in this situation? I do not mess with guys who have girlfriends, but would it be dumb of me to just drop the whole thing and just ignore him/not take notice of him? I don't have any interest in getting with someone who is in a relationship.

BUT, I would kind of feel dumb if I just dropped the ball on something because of a hunch. The hunch is that I've seen a girl around him who seems pretty flirty and hangs around him often. There is a good chance they are dating, but also not confirmed and in my experience it could be any sort of relationship. What if he IS single? Or what if he's in a casual relationship, friend with benefits or even just a close girl friend who is naturally flirty and clingy? None of those things bother me in terms of interest in a guy, but if it's something MORE, I'm out and not interested. 

What would you do? I've considered asking around, but I'm a pretty frequent visitor and I would be mortified if I asked and it got around that I was interested in him while he was dating. Should I just observe and see what happens? I'm completely fine with just watching and waiting, but it also worries me that I might be obvious. Pretty sure he's caught me looking at him plenty of times, and he's taken notice of me to the extent that he eyes me when I come in. This could either be cause he's interested (probably not lol!) or because he's caught on to my interest.

But there really isn‚Äôt. There is a limited window in life to build a life-longish relationship and family. The kind of relationship most would ideally want. 

There isn‚Äôt always another person. Another chance. You might get 3-5 goes of serious long term relationships (5+ years) before you‚Äôre 50. 

Once you‚Äôre 50 starting a family Is a difficult or impossible scenario. For women at that age kids are virtually impossible. 

People give up on each other too fast now. Think they have unlimited time and options. This is why in our lifetime there will be massive amount of single childless people. Narcissism primarily feeds this through the illusion of opportunity and the idea there‚Äôs always something better out there. (Thank social media and dating apps.) 

I won‚Äôt say stay in bad relationships. But remember before you bail on a relationship there aren‚Äôt endless chances. You only get a few shots. Time is of the essence. If you want a life partner and kids, date with intention, and date others with intention. 

Every week, month, year, life is going by and that window to build is narrowing. If you don‚Äôt meet that person, you‚Äôre not alone, many won‚Äôt. Sometimes it‚Äôs just the luck of the draw.

We went on a first date and because of lockdowns we took a walk in the park. The weather was terrible but we had a great time and it was actually kind or romantic ( drinking takeway tea huddled up beneath an umbrella )

We wanted to meet eachother again but not sure when. A week after I asked I wished her a nice weekend cause she was going away for a couple days. Turned out she cancelled that trip and had time to come over.

That night sparks flew. She kissed like me like she was going to eat me alive. We had sex and cuddled afterwards and talked about deep stuff and her insecurities. She wqs my first after a 9 year emotionally abusibe relationship i'd been in.

Before she left that night she told me she was very introverted and it could affect her mood a lot so she asked me not to message her too much.

As a dumbass I text her some sweet nothings and I got some crumpy replies. A week after that she messaged me that indeed her mood had been soured and that the spark was gone that she felt.

I felt so stupid afterwards but also a bit wronged and bitter.  I was honest that I felt strongly towards her that I couldnt help myself. Also told her she was my first after a very long and difficult time and I was in the clouds.

She opened up to me and told me this was her first attempt ar something serious. Her being Chinese, her family was very strict about dating western guys. So it was all new to her ( her parents still live in china )

Is this normal for women? To bail out because of 2 sweet nothing texts after a fantastic night and deep romantic talk?

I cant't help but to feel my feelings have been hurt quite bad by this.

I am looking for advice to how to handle some things in my relationship better, as I'm quite inexperienced and am still learning to understand emotions of people surrounding me.

So, I'm (20F) dating a guy (22M) for almost two years now, living together for year and a half. I know it was a rushed decision, but we both wanted to get out of our family issues at the time and living together then seemed like a solution. 

Some background information about us - while he's outgoing, has lots of friends and a big family, has no issues with communication, is somewhat confident in himself, was basically known as ""the dude who could break anyone"" in his hometown when he was a teen, I'm the opposite - my social circle has dropped to my mom and bf at this point, I've always been shy and quiet, I have a hard time when it comes to communicating my emotions and wishes, I've been dealing with depression for 9 years now. I'm sure he has some issues of his own, but please don't suggest therapy as a solution, I know that it would be good for both him and I, but we can't currently afford it, we barely make the meets end and are in debt. 

Now, to the things that I don't really understand and am not great dealing with : 

‚Ä¢ He sometimes has huge switchs of moods, like one moment we can be all sweet and stuff, and next he can blow up for me accidentally misplacing things, being thoughtful, himself accidentaly dropping something and the list goes on, sometimes I can't really recognize what it is that caused the awful mood change. When the switch is really bad, he can say lots of mean things that hurt, be somewhat agressive or very cold towards me, which kind of scares me. He himself says that he doesn't understand what it is with him when that happens, and that he knows that some thoughts should stay thoughts when he feels bad, but he can't help it and says everything that's on his mind. How could I help him calm down when that happens (sometimes physical affection and nice words help, but not always, and if he says to not touch him I don't initiate anything) and if things do get bad, how do I not take it close to the heart?

‚Ä¢ He is super possessive and sometimes paranoid about me leaving him - while right now in this aspect everything's calm, in the past he had episodes where he felt that way, and it's bothering me a bit. I've accepted that if I ever were to talk when he's taking me with him when hanging out with his friends I'd be doomed (I have anxiety so it's not easy for me to talk with strangers, yet it still makes me feel a bit lonely when he brings his friends around), but what really bothers me is how he used to check my phone (all personal messages, calls, notepads (I used to have a diary there that helped me to understand why I felt certain way sometimes, but everything that was there was mostly negative stuff and since there was a lot of bad things about him as well (had our issues)), it caused me to become paranoid enough to abandon the hobby of writing and isolate myself from my internet best friend even more. If I were to ask a hour to myself (I need time to get some rest from people, I get overwhelmed easily), he'd start suspecting I'm going to betray him behind his back or something. I know he has a trauma from being cheated on by his exes, but I don't even communicate with any males, don't go out, am always by myself when he's not around, and being constantly suspected in something I'd never ever do angers me, even though I try to keep that to myself. Sometimes he even makes up some scenarious in his head (especially after nightmares if he gets them) and refuses to believe to anything I say. While I get that he wants to know everything that's in my head and has lots of bad experiences, I'm not used to sharing absolutely everything, am not comfortable with that, want to be able to have my time alone without any fights and fusses, how should I approach a topic so sensitive to him?

‚Ä¢ How do I feel safer/calmer around him again? I don't handle confrontation well, in past we had lots of communication issues - I have a trauma regarding to expressing emotions, if I brought up something that bothered me it was usually days later or during argues, and it would make him angry that I didn't adress the issue when it happened, or even worse - spoke about it with someone else instead of him. We are working on it, what made it so hard for me was an incident we had few weeks ago. Basically he read my diary (all of the old ones, that were like year ago), misunderstood a huge part of it (he's not great at English, I write only in English as it comforts me more than my native language, online translators aren't accurate when it comes to languages that are used by like 2 million of the entire world's population), he was on amphetamine withdrawal, things got a bit physical, I  didn't sleep for 2 days, my computer (it was a 18th birthday gift from my mom, so it has a huge value to me) was broken (it works but the panel from screen is coming off, edges are completely ripped off), he says he only meant to scare me but it slipped out of his hands and fell. I remember laying on the bed and listening to all the graphic things he said he'd do to me, I know he wasn't himself then as he was under drugs, but it was still scary and has made it hard for me to be 100% relaxed when around him. He promised he'd never do it again and wouldn't use amph anymore, he was regretting what he had done and apologising for a week, especially every time he saw my bruises, I want to move on but how can I know that it won't happen again? The harshest fights between us always were when he was under substances, and as long as he doesnt use them, he's not physically violent with me and tries to control his flashes of anger as much as he can. 

In case if that background information is needed, he became alcoholic at 14, I helped him to become sober from that in the first year of our relationship, now he rarely drinks, and if he does, it's not the amount that would make him go crazy. As for drugs, I know he has struggled with them for at least 4 years, currently we both are struggling with getting clean from weed, but he doesn't use anything that could make him violent and that's great. I know that those things I wrote about him make him sound like a bad person, but deep down he's kind, wants to help people (as far as I've seen he especially enjoys to help elders which I think is really sweet), he's religious, had awful childhood (abuse). Now that he's back to work (he was waiting 2 months to get there, he got another boss now who seems to be more reliable) he seems to be calmer and more satisfied with himself (previously it was me who worked, I get paid 2.5‚Ç¨ per hour and my salary is not enough to cover all of the bills and apartment costs, he makes twice as much, so we're able to worry a bit less about financial situation, he's even brought up me taking some time off to find a better job or simply to relax as me staying home makes him feel calmer, however I don't think it's a good decision till we get all of our debts paid and have a somewhat comfortable living (he supported my decision, but said that if I change my mind and want to take some time off, it's okay). (I've been on sick leave that ended yesterday, was supposed to go to work today but asked for another free day. Maybe someone has any ideas how to deal with fatigue and burn out and get back to work without it feeling like I am forcing myself to do the impossible thing? If I skip anotherday I'm afraid my boss will get pissed and fire me, I already missed out a lot.) 

Even though the last few days in our relationship have been calmer than last few months altogether, I know that he has a lot on his plate and simply want to figure out solution that would work for both of us/ ways to deal with his moods in case if things get bad again.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1155088,public,self,How to understand my boyfriends emotions better?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sdxi74/how_to_understand_my_boyfriends_emotions_better/,no_ads,0.0,,,,

I could really use some advice about dating...
So there's two girls. Let's call them S and L.

I have a big crush on S but she rejected me (kindly) when i asked for a date very early after meeting her. Also she seemed a little insecure when rejecting me and afterwards she continues to be very nice to me. We train together and there's a good vibe. I see her 2-4 times a week. 

L has a crush on me and texted me a few months after we first met on a BBQ at a friends. After beeing rejected by S I was very pleased about L's interest in me and we went for a first date (well more casual than you could really put a 'date' label on it). We also text casually and she wants to continue dating.

Here's the thing: L is a nice girl, very kind and down to earth, she's pretty with a normal but still slender figure. We vibe and have good talks/texts but she's not the kind of woman that normally catches my eye.
I don't really feel attracted to L, but it rarely happens that a girl pursues her interest in me like she does and she's fun to hang around with.
Because of this (and bc I am biased to go for the beautiful and aesthetic looking girls, but want to learn to value character more) I want to give her a chance and hope that maybe attraction to her can develop.

But now I feel bad because my head is all around S and this inhibits my commitment to L. 
Also I want to continue doing sports with S, bc we have more hobbies in common like skiing, hiking, weightlifting, running etc. Also in soite of her rejection S doesn't give me the feeling that it's a lost case and I still want to get to know her better.
Atm I don't pursue anything towards S more than friendship unless she sends me signs of anything more. 

I don't really know what to do about L now. How do I communicate to her? I also think she can sense that something's holding me back bc I'm really bad at pretending everything is ok if it isn't. As of yet she doesn't know anything about S. I also don't know how much she's into me already or if she's just cheking me out for more (although I think she's gonna go for sex rather quickly bc she's kinda kinky girl)

I'd really appreciate some advice here :)

Ladies, please (guys too, to a much lesser extent), if you're not interested in dating, or anything along those lines, get off of dating apps. Just get off. You're literally wasting digital space; taking up limited likes, and diluting the pool of people who are actually using the apps for their intended purposes, when apps that exist for your desired purposes already exist.

So apparently there are five different kinds of people on dating apps. 1, people who are allegedly just there to socialize. 2, people who are there for the illusion of getting fawned over by strangers for some strange sense of gratification. 3, people who are there for the express purpose of hashtag wasting his time 2022. 4, people who are there for hookups. And 5, people who are there to meet someone to date.

Each and every one of these demographics already has an app or even several dedicated to their needs. 1 has a vast ocean of social media apps to choose from. 2 has Instagram. 3 has bumble. 4 has tinder. So if you have intended purposes with an app already filling them, please get the hell out of the way of 5. Asking you to use apps for appropriate purposes is not that big of an ask.

I met a girl back in September we hit it off very well we both have a lot of things in common, we communicate very easily, and things are just great in general whenever we're hanging out we have great chemistry in bed etc.

She does have cptsd and certain things trigger her but she also says that being around me also helps keep her calm and regulated and grounds her when she feels dissociated or triggered.

Now when we first met I was still talking to my ex but purely as platonic friends and had been for several months at this point. She mentioned that it concerned her and that if we were to pursue anything seriously that I would have to cut ties with my ex.

She's been very wishy-washy and back and forth and hot and cold about a relationship as she's not sure if she's quite ready for it due to mental health issues and past trauma, so I'm unsure about how confident I am in cutting off a good platonic friendship for something so hot and cold, but I am definitely willing to give it a solid chance and an honest effort.

Fast forward a couple weeks I told her that me and my ex were no longer going to be talking, she was happy with that, all was well. 

Fast forward another two weeks or so and my ex called me, I didn't answer the phone, but sent her a message telling her I was at work.

While hanging out with this girl last night she saw that I had sent a message to my ex recently, and then last night just turned into a big argument about how she's upset and doesn't believe me or trust me, so I drove her home and that ended the night.

This morning she sent me a text saying that I kind of broke her heart and she doesn't want anything to do with it and to please leave her alone basically.

My dilemma is I don't know what to do moving forward because I do actually really care about this girl and she's also expressed that she really cares about me we've both already said that we love each other numerous times.

I'm hoping this is all going to blow over and she'll reach out to me in a couple days, but as of this morning I've apologized profusely told her how upset I am with myself for having caused her this type of pain and to feel this way, and she says she forgives me but she doesn't want to get involved if I'm still holding onto my past.

I've dated other people in this time but always appreciated her sense of humor and elegance. She hasn't had a serious relationship the whole time, and has mentioned she's not going out of her way to find one. We've only very rarely hung out alone, and that's only when we're at her place and everyone leaves for the night. There's no history between us.

4 weeks ago she invited me to come dancing with her and some of the friend group. Everyone ended up leaving and I ended up driving her home. My car was robbed and a window was smashed, so when we got back to her place, we worked together to get it covered for the night. It was a bonding experience and led to talking until 7am.

We've been going as a group dancing for the last 4 weekends, but it hasn't ended up with just us again. That was the backstory I suppose. Anyways, I've been having multiple dreams of us holding hands and being intimate over these past 4 weeks. I wake up fulfilled for 10 seconds then disappointed that it wasn't real.

I haven't really flirted at all, I just notice that we react more to each others messages more-so than others in the group chat. Obviously it being a friend makes this a delicate situation, but I would like to pursue these feelings. I'm fairly attractive and in good shape, but I'm shyish and naive.

What advice might you have in terms of flirting, perceiving mutual attraction, or just anything on the topic from your own intuition or experience?
