I used to get pretty fixated on finding a girlfriend and hated being alone while watching so many successful relationships.

Now, I've accepted that I live a life that women are not interested in participating in and I decided that my personal values are more important.

That sounds pretty heavy. The personal values I speak of are just anti-materialism and minimalism. I cherish things that cannot be bought with money but rather, hard work. Running, playing bass, practicing a new language, and other fleeting hobbies. I also strongly dislike car culture in the United States. Also, not a fan of exceptionalism and individualism.

The minimalism and lack of owning a car puts off most people. I get it. No one wants to be a chauffeur but I also don't want someone to drive me around. I choose where I live specifically because I know I won't be driving. So, close to a grocery store, mass transit, and keeping my commute to work in mind.

I like my lifestyle. I take pride in it.

It's weird though because a romantic relationship is different from a typical friendship. I have friends and I go meet up with them. Me not driving is never an issue. Occasionally for wilderness trips but I try to balance friends driving with other contributions I can make. I'm planning a camping/fishing trip next week that doesn't use cars. I am doubtful find a romantic partner who would be cool with assembling a backpack, take mass transit out to somewhere and then walk miles to where ever.

It seems that people are not interested in romantic friendships. What they want is codependent life-building relationships. I just want someone who wants to hang out with me. Literally all I ask. Just someone to seek out my company.

I said I'm over it but me writing clearly shows I am not. It's just wild that I would get a car, just for dating. Just for dating. Car payments, insurance, maintenance, repairs, fuel, registration, not to mention that a car over all is something I need to be mindful of. All that, just to date.

So there it is.

We hit things off immediately and really connected. Our mindsets, lifestyles, and chemistry match each other. We both are independent &amp; secure.
It was honestly really refreshing and no red flags were presented.

We weren’t officially a relationship but talked about the possibility of being serious after he got back from a month long trip. hes clarified that this wasn’t causally hooking up &amp; we hung out always without it resulting to sex/a lot of meaningful talks. 

The week before he left, the vibe changed. 
I could feel he was pulling away from me/ distant with communicating (text) based on how he normally is.

We hung out beforehand and I felt reassured because he said he would FaceTime me and his body language/our conversations showed the chemistry was still there. 

Since he left, we communicated almost everyday but there’s a major time difference. So most of our conversations have been surface leveled and short. Not sure if it was because of this but I try not to let it affect me, but still feel like our relationship changed because it continues to be platonic &amp; not as engaging or playful. 

Hes actions almost feels as if he doesn’t care to lose me which has been bothering me because I feel like things are stagnant and we never ended up FaceTiming each other. So it’s been causing me anxiety because I’m not sure if he’s feelings for me changed.

It’s almost been a month now, and he will be back in the next week. So I’m gonna know if it’s just my anxiety talking or things between us has changed. 

Of course yesterday I was creeping on social media and see hes mutuals again with his ex of 3 years/ liked a recent photo of hers. They broke up 2 years ago and it was on bad terms. 

He broke up with her because she was difficult to be with, constant fighting due to overall insecurities and was very dependent on him. Like needing constantly to text/call each other and would stay multiple days at his place even uninvited to a point he would have to ask her to leave. Fighting because she wanted him to unfollow girls on Instagram that he knew in real life, even if they had a bf. Her reasoning for this if they post something “sexy” that she didn’t want him to see that stuff on his feed. Along with going to parties together and her having a problem with him talking to another girl/issues with him hanging out with his friends over her.

Like I said, he’s independent and appears to be a genuinely loyal person. I’m sure there’s more to it.

It’s been a month since I started seeing someone.
We hit it off really well and spent a lot of time together - we actually took a spontaneous trip for the fourth, spent weekends after that, went out on a few dinner dates/runs during the week.

Last week told me that he likes me and that he wants to date me “long term”. I told him I’d like to date him but I want to take it a little slow at labeling things since I’m pretty newly out of a serious relationship. So we’ve been hanging out and acting like a couple without having a label. 

But I’m really confused as to how he’s really feeling and what it is that he wants.

So- He’s been really quick to finish when we have sex, or will lose his hard on sometimes. I’ve been ok with it but he said that maybe he’s not the one for me and that he doesn’t want to hold me back and that he feels like he’s failing me, since he can’t give me what I want.
I took that as him saying that we should end things, so I suggested that I think it’s best if we stop seeing each other. 
I really like this guy, but I thought he was insinuating that it’s not going to work out.
Once I said we should stop hanging out like this, he told me that he doesn’t want to stop, and that he wants to date me.

I was confused as to what he was saying, since he had literally asked me to be his gf (as mentioned earlier) but also sounded like he was backing out of it.
He has introduced me to a lot of his friends already and they’re all asking me if we are “official” yet and what not.

He tells me he likes me but I can’t stop feeling like I’m getting mixed messages.

He told me that he doesn’t want to play games… but he also goes an entire day without texting/calling me. (Although the does reach out on most days.)

He knows that I’m very much into him (I don’t try to hide it)- but when it comes to texting him/talking about where this is going, I feel like there’s a lot of uncertainty. I find myself not even being able to text him bc I don’t want to be ""clingy"".

Last week, I went to a new microbrewery before a local baseball game, where I met this really nice girl. We hit it off really well, and I just so happened to have two tickets, with a buddy of mine bailing two hours before the game. I got her number after the game, and made sure she got home okay.

A couple days later I had asked her if she wanted to get sushi Monday (today) night. And she accepted. She's a super busy woman, she works as a shift supervisor, so I haven't really texted her all that much because I don't want to be annoying.

The weekend goes by, and I've been super happy, I told all my coworkers and their moms (not literally) that I *finally* had a date. It's been way too long.

Fast forward to today, I send her a good morning text, and she responds later in the day, about an hour ago, saying she has to work late. Bummer.

Now, I've had women bail on me *on the way there,* or literally an hour before I'm supposed to leave. Happened about 99% of the time.

So to get to the point of my post, I'm just super happy I met a girl who communicates, says, ""hey, I'm sorry I have to work late."" Yeah, it sucks the date is off, but just to find someone who communicates has turned my life around, I could not be happier.


TL;DR met this girl last week, hit it off nicely. Planned a date night, and texted me well in advance that she had to work late.

Yet, here we are. I M(23) recently got into a relationship with someone F(19). We have hit if off fantastically, I feel safe with her, can be myself, and feel totally open with her and she says, and I believe, she feels the same.  

A short backstory on myself. I was a virgin until having sex with her. First time, yesterday actually. I waited because I wanted to find someone I felt I could be myself around. I was waiting until marriage, but I have decided to do away with that idea, I’m getting older and wasn’t wanting to wait any longer. I came to this decision before I met her, a couple months maybe, that I didn’t mind having it before marriage. I met her, got into a relationship, discussed that I was a virgin, she didn’t care, and we talked about sex, she wanted to have it, so did I, great!  

So, two nights ago, we are almost naked, fooling around, having fun. I take her clothes off, she asks to make sure if this is what I want, I say yes, I ask her in return, she says yes. I have a tendency to overthink everything so at that time, it was not a good thing for me to have that question rolling in my head and questioning if she wanted it. But I carried on, because I did want to and she said she did as well. I get naked, and the equipment malfunctions. I was hard this whole time, when we kiss I am, when I see her, most of the time I am. Now this.  Worthless. I try to get started again but by that time, I think I just started to freak out and could not carry on. I told her. She was extremely sympathetic and understanding, a wonderful person. I tell her I am angry and upset with myself, and mostly embarrassed. Never thought this would happen to me. It has been the most embarrassing moment of my life. She then starts to cry thinking she did something wrong, or I’ll leave her, I assure her she didn’t. I told her I was overthinking and got nervous. She gets me ice cream and we go to bed.   

So the next day, we spend the whole day with one another and I decided let’s try for round 2 (or actually accomplish round 1). We were both ready. We were naked, equipment wasn’t working entirely, but after throwing out all my dumb thoughts and nerves it succeeded in working. We had sex. Happened really fast, didn’t last long, it was expected. I actually make jokes we only had 1/10 of sex since it happened within 3 minutes. I think my body is acting this way because I did get really nervous, I was sweating, shaking a little, and honestly, not enjoying myself as much as I thought. It was great, because I love her and I got to share that with her, yet beyond poor performance.  

I would like to hear from people who have had experiences like this. How to help solve it? Problems it might be? How do you calm your nerves? Is this erectile dysfunction?

He’ll text me and say “how’s your day” at 8 am but when I respond he ignores me. Or he will message me to hang out and then ghost me. Like why message me first only to ignore me..? He also texted me a couple weeks ago when he was on vacation with his family.. Seemed like he just wanted to chat.

I get that he probably is dating around (heck me too), but why blatantly waste my time? I straight up told him it is annoying when he asks me to hang out and then never replies. He said he was sorry and the last time we made plans he actually followed through. (Although I’m not gonna beg someone to hang out, just told him how I felt.)

The next day he texts me “I like hanging out with you, you’re fun to be around.” He messaged again the following day by asking how work was, only to ignore my response when I asked how his workday was.

Very mixed signals… Mostly leaning toward uninterested, but why keep me texting me first to not even respond? I wouldn’t hit up a guy I was just hooking up with randomly to ask about his day. Feels like he is playing a game but in person he is really chill, doesn’t seem calculated or like he pulls a lot of girls tbh (part of the reason I initially was into him.) 

Let me get this straight, I am not trying to pursue a serious relationship. He is the only chill guy I have hung out with in a very long time so I would regularly hook up with him if I had that option. Not sure if he hasn’t got that through his thick skull or maybe he’s just busy, maybe it’s other girls, maybe I should spell it out for him… idk.

What I do know is you don’t text someone twice a week if you’re uninterested, but you also don’t ignore people’s texts for fun, gotta have some motive. I have just as much a right as any man to a fwb without catching feelings so I am allowed to be curious about his interest in this situation.

It’s so important to take care of your sexual health. 
I mean this in terms of getting tested for STI/Ds

As a female I have heard from a guy friend (who gets tested) that a lot of his friends “wait” for the girl to come back saying they have something or it’s clear. 

I find that absurd as that person could never come back and tell you they are “clear” or have something or just straight up lie. 

Please take care of your sexual health, you’re not just being responsible for yourself but others. 

I personally use a condom until we are both wanting to become exclusive and fluid bond (even then it’s not guaranteed that someone could go with someone else &amp; come back to you with something or vice versa) 

With anyone I have slept with, I let them know that I am clear before, also after I get checked and let them know as well as doing a pregnancy test. 

A friend recently got diagnosed with HIV and what’s really out of order, is the person they slept with knew they had it but didn’t inform them…

Also, after watching shows like sexual health clinics, there are so many people who have never used protection and or ne we got tested! This really opened my eyes up!

Both groups of short women and tall men have the weirdest height preferences even from what i've seen.

If a guy is taller than them but they aren't ""average or above"" they are ""too short."" Reverse this with tall men. I've seen tall men say that women that are 5'6 and up are ""too tall"" because they are not ""short"" and they only like ""short"" women so they only like a certain range that is ""short"" to them even though a 5'8 woman is 8 inches shorter than a 6'4 man she is not ""short"" because she is considered a tall woman.

I've even seen tall guys literally state that they only like women under 5'4 and they actively reject women that are 5'4+ because they are literally not short by the countries standards.

I am 27 y/o.

Basically, I tried to contact my neighbours grand-daughter through her Instagram account (I wanted to wait until she came over, but she is never there). Tbh I thought fuck it, why not? I sent a DM (with my intentions) with a follow request and she declined the request (though I later came to find out she was in a relationship, when she declined). Not long after sending the DM her presence around my neighbours has increased a lot over the past 6 months.

My neighbours house is attached to mine, so we are like toe-toe. About 1 month after sending the DM she has been out on the neighbours drive standing alone a few times. The one time I caught her staring at our kitchen window with a smile on her face and she seen me (in the kitchen) and her head shot down FAST! Like she got caught. She was squatting (outside) of her car staring through the passenger window into our kitchen window. When she knew she got caught, she went back into the house.😂

And recently, I was out front mowing the lawn and to my surprise she and her grandmother pulled up on their drive. She was like 10-15 feet away from me. But had her back turned to me and she seemed a little nervous (she didn’t seem to rush away though). Just as she is waiting for her grandmother to open the house door, (I see in my peripheral) she kinda does this slow glance as me. I didn’t look at her cause I didn’t wanna look like I was staring. Then they go on in the house.

3-4 days later around 21:00, I see her standing on the drive (in the night time) for about 2-3mins glancing at my kitchen window again. I didn’t do anything because I don’t really know the reason why she was looking, impossible to tell. Then she gets in her car and pulls off and stops/waits directly outside my house staring at our house for like another 2-3 mins and she does this weird slow drive past the house whilst the person in the passenger (I think her Mother) seat looking at my house. 100% sure they couldn’t see me looking.

And another time, (on there drive) her mother was out of the car glancing at our kitchen window, whilst the ‘Crush’ is in the car and then the crush gets out and starts to take selfies.

Could anyone interpret these situations for me? And, I am not going to approach her on my neighbours drive if I don’t know she wants to be approached. I think it’s way too close to home and risky business. I want to cause she is so beautiful. But, If it wasn’t so close to home I would take the risk.

The way how I see it is, if she wanted me to approach she would have given me something more than a glance just before she goes into the front door, when I was on my front garden. But it’s the glances/staring at my house which makes me wonder… could she be shy or is just curious. And no I don’t believe she is creeped out, I sent 1 Instagram DM/follow and left it at that.

-

Would a women really expect a man to approach her without her giving some kind of invitation?

BTW, the neighbour (grandmother) is still completely friendly to me.

Also, our houses are litterly toe-toe, as soon as I go into my kitchen I can see onto my neighbours drive.

- 29 year old male
- Slim to fit build weighing 175 lbs. 
- Accountant pursuing CPA (testing)
- strong partner potential at the firm I work at
- clean and healthy with less than 10 sexual partners
- I have my own hobbies and goals that I'm more than happy to pursue in lieu of a likeminded woman.

I usually don't have any trouble finding women to date its just they don't really want the same things I do when I find one that meets #1 and #2 below.

My requirements for a partner:
- Don't be overweight. So this isn't like I'm going to take her measurements and check the bmi scale but I don't want someone who can't take care of themselves and you usually can tell this be looking at their weight. Also, I don't find it attractive just in a physical sense.
- Don't have kids from another man. Pretty self explanatory but I don't want to take care of someone else's kids plus it is a sign of poor decision making in my view.
- want to have kids before you're 35. Mostly because I dont want young kids running around when I'm that old and the increase chances of birth defects during advanced maternal age pregnancy. Also, my main reason for wanting a woman in my life is to pursue a family.

In my experience it's only women that don't meet the first two that want the last. Or they are beyond 30 years old in which case it seems like they want someone older and more established than myself. Also, I'm sure many might change their minds but I really don't feel like wasting time on someone who doesn't change their mind.

Just so everyone knows, I'm not complaining I just want to know if y'all I'm being to harsh by saying I'll forego all the hassle of dating and marriage if I can't find these three things in a Woman as basic requirements

I was pushing 200 pounds and it wasn't where I wanted to be. So the early portion of the pandemic was a fun challenge. I'm a social drinker, so if I couldn't be social, why drink? I went 42 days without alcohol and returned to running and got down to 180 in a hurry. I'll never forget the immediate reaction of my long distance ex when I took my shirt off- ""*holy shit, you look great*"". 

She didn't last much longer- I ended things in June 2020. After that, I had a pure vanity project- ""*once the gyms open up, i'm getting hot as shit... there's nothing else to do!"".* I was happy to drop pounds, but i wanted to put on muscle too. My state opened gym back up in September and I went to work. I had a baseline of weightlifting from half-hearted attempts in previous years, but this time I was laser focused. I honestly attribute a lot of my newfound focus to Metallica- I used to only listen to rap while working out, but I found blasting Master of Puppets to be so much funner and more effective... I've since expanded to other Big 4 albums in my rotation. 

Now- I say semi-consistent because physical therapy caused some speed bumps. I had to see a PT for a super tight scapular region in the fall that took about 6 weeks to clear up. I had more upper shoulder issues this spring that required dry needling. I'm now seeing a PT to clear up what's hopefully the last injury- a weird radial nerve. Point being- it hasn't been a straight line!

That being said, working out has been a game changer.  I'm not a sex-god by any means- the opposite in fact. I'm pretty talkative and steer conversation to benign topics so I think I fall in the friend-zone pretty easily. So if you reading this expecting a dramatic change- so far I have no tangible news to report. I'm still caught in the dating limbo. But *man...* It is so nice to be able to wear tight pants to show off my ass. To be able to wear a shirt with shorter sleeves on a date to show that I have (some) biceps. It's so nice to take a shirt off at the beach without hesitation. I put in a ton of work, and it's incredibly rewarding to have to show some fruits of my labor.  It's definitely been a confidence boost in so many little ways. And in that it's been a game changer.

I still have a lot of work to do. I want to be able to bench 225 (two plates!). I want to continue to calibrate my diet so I can have abs- which I've found to be very difficult to achieve! But I'm very proud of myself. To all the folks in here that read these r/dating posts thinking ""would it be worth my time to hit the gym? does this hackneyed advice actually hold weight?""

The breakup was just about a week ago, so quite recent. That said, I thought about it a lot and was very sure about it when I broke up with him. 

I am not the type of person to jump between relationships AT ALL; I stayed single for a year after my first breakup and 9 months after my second. In fact, I consider it a red flag when someone is never single. But I met this guy (24M) at a party last night and we hit it off immediately. He’s not my usual type physically, not ugly or anything but I honestly think I would have swiped left on him on a dating app. But... he was funny, respectful, has similar views to mine on things like religion and politics and his charisma was undeniable- every time he complimented me I would lose my ability to form words lol. We spent the entire duration of the party talking and he even walked me home. We have plans to go out this weekend and I am finding myself super excited about it.

I have two concerns though. The first is the fact that I’m so fresh out of a relationship, and even though I have no regrets I don’t want to put him in a position where he’s worried about unfinished business with my ex. The second is that, even though I felt all of the things that I normally do when I want to jump someone’s bones (lol) I’m worried about whether I will still be physically attracted to him without the excitement and alcohol. I don’t consider myself a superficial person but physical attraction does matter to me; can I be physically attracted to someone I don’t objectively find all that good looking?

I mean, if there arose a situation that needed to be cleared up, I think I would let her look at my phone, but I wouldn't give her the password; I wouldn't give her instant, on-demand access to my accounts, and I wouldn't expect anything like that in return either. Does that make sense? Let me know what you think. As it stands now, I'm inclined to continue to refuse to give away my passwords, even if I get married and become fully committed to a woman.

About five years ago I dated a man I went to school with (since we were little). After a few months, he ghosted me after getting back together with his ex girlfriend. 

Fast forward a few years and we maintained a friendship. Of course, he and his ex broke it off, and he began pursuing me, but I said no based off his previous behavior. 

Fast forward a couple more years, and we went for a hike about two months ago. For the first time, he accepted full responsibility for his actions and said he really blew it with me (duh). I have a lot to offer as a person in relationship. I am loyal, smart, successful, passionate about helping people, physically fit, and own my own business. So, after he tells me this, we talk and I tell him I would be open to pursuing furthering our friendship, but that I was not in a place where I trusted him, so sex was OFF THE TABLE for now. And that if he wanted to show me that he was serious about pursuing a relationship, this is where we’d start. 

Things seemed to be trucking along, then bam, I get an illicit photo. I did not ask for this photo, I did not send a photo, I did not say anything remotely sexual, in fact my last text was a nature photo. 

Gotta be honest, this felt like sitting in a public place and having some man shove his d!ck in my face. What is it with men that they think this is okay behavior? This guy and many other men would never walk up to me in public and pull that. 

Of course, when I point out what I had explicitly told him about the status of our relationship he tells me “it was a joke”. 

As a woman I am so sick and tired of male entitlement and then the minimization that followed. I suggested he read a book on it, which he won’t, but gheez. 

The good news is, I’m getting better at asserting boundaries. And really, I have plenty of d!ck thrown at me. How dumb does he have to be to think that would make me think, “Ohhhh baby.” 

Vent over. The advice? Don’t ever send an illicit photo unless you are asked and if you are wondering wether or not you should, just ask yourself if you’d do that in real life.

It's been great so far, we laugh a lot together, like the same music, humor, history, lots of common interests etc. We don't really fight, which...I'm not so sure is a good thing at this stage of a relationship, or it means we get along really well. The only time trouble arises is when I go back home (his family lives in the city, but mine are a flight away elsewhere), about a month ago he expressed this makes him feel like I'm always 'leaving him', or that he has to 'chase me', and that he wishes to get closer to me in our relationship. We did long-distance for 6 weeks at the very beginning of our relationship, and then again this summer for another 3 weeks. I've complained to him about going home because it's in the boring suburbs, but I do it for my family because my folks are older and I don't get to see them all the time. I also complain that my parents are stricter and often feel judged for my life choices, but it is something I've come to live with (one is Asian, and they r boomers lol). He, on the other hand, has much more understanding parents and doesn't understand why I would have to go home when I don't exactly want to. I get where he's coming from, and it seems like he just wants me to be happy and make my own choices, and I've assured him that it's not my intention to 'leave him', but in my family love = sacrifice, aka sometimes I gotta go home even when I'm not dying to. Now, I've been back for more than 3 weeks now, with no plans to go back home anytime soon. In the beginning, when we reunited it was great, I met his family on 4th of July and got along well with them. But since then, it feels like I've initiated 90% of the other times we have hung out (beach days, movie nights, dinners), and always have to be the one to ask him to do something. He has been busy starting a new job this month and taking an online class at our college, so I understand that he is busy - but, I also have 2 part-time jobs going on plus classes. I just feel confused, because a month ago he said he wished to be closer to me and spend lots more time together, but now that I'm back in the city, it's as though we might as well be doing long-distance anyways. I just feel confused, manipulated, hurt, and rejected. I get that he may just be busy and not have time to hang out, but it would be nice to be asked for dinner, or even just to come over and watch some tv/a basketball game, or anything really, even a quick call before bedtime. It makes me feel like he doesn't think about me / may not even like me. And I don't know whether to confront him about all of this, or whether It's just all in my head and I need to just chill out and focus on my own work (which I have as well) and stop overthinking things. I just think if you really loved someone, you'd always make time for them. Also: he's a workaholic, and quite introverted, which you wouldn't know at first because he's quite conversational, and has expressed to me that when he hangs out with other people and doesn't work, he feels guilty. But still, I don't think being a workaholic is an excuse for neglecting your loved one. We see each other about 2 times a week, whereas I've talked to my friends and they see their boyfriends around 4-5 days a week. I understand that everyone's needs in a relationship are different, but mine just aren't being met, and I'm scared he's getting cold feet, or maybe this is just how he operates in a relationship. 

Also, we're meant to go to Italy in a week and a half, and I practically had to beg him to come with me because I thought it would be fun to travel together. It took him a while to agree because he was deciding on whether he should take a semester off school, and ultimately I think decided to. But even though he agreed, he has not initiated any of the planning. My mom has been a bigger help finding plane tickets and accommodations than he has. I worry that he resents me for taking this time away from him and his work, and that he doesn't actually want to go. But I really want to just go to Italy with him and have a fun time, and show him how to relax and smell the roses type beat. Anyways, basicallyyyyyy should I just chillax and understand people in relationships get busy, orrr is there something up/should I voice my concerns?

I’m 19 y/o and a rising sophomore @college. I met a girl (19) at a bar last weekend and was really hitting it off with her.

We talked a bunch over the first few days, even with her making the occasional sexually motivated reference now and then, saying that she’s excited for me to be in town again.

Over the weekend it kind of slowed down and when I told her I was gonna be in town next weekend and she gave a very dry response. She’s been responding pretty frequently, but I feel as though I did something wrong.

She had just came off of a relationship but she seemed very willing to talk to me at the bar and over the last week, but I feel like (maybe) something had changed recently. 

I know it’s hard to pinpoint what (if anything) is wrong, but can anyone lead me in the right direction?

If this week comes and goes and she doesn’t mention this weekend, should I say something again?

He has bad qualities but there are some things I love about him, he can be so affectionate &amp; gives me an abundant supplies of kisses &amp; “I love you”s, he’s never cheated or even talked with another girl, he’s always been there when I needed to rant or cry, if we get into big arguments he’ll let me have the W so we can go back to talking to each other, &amp; etc….

His best friend (23, M) even helped me secure a job at his job. Within my first year of working there I met a guy (22, F) who worked on the night crew while I worked during the morning. I thought he was cool &amp; really nice so we  added each other on snap chat and Instagram. He would compliment my posts but it was all platonic &amp; he knew I had a bf. But he was a total gent &amp; claims he doesnt flirt with Girls in relationships. One thing I didn’t care for was the fact that he loves attention and loves to flirt with single ladies. 
Eventually he moved to the morning shift &amp; I thought cool,new friend. Within weeks he’d start writing on my water cups &amp; we started hugging whenever he’d see each other or say bye. He hugs other girls too dont get me wrong but oh my lord his hugs are to die for &amp; I dont want to sound like a  weirdo but he smells amazing. He’s tall (taller that my bf by like 5 or 6 inches) so his body just absorbs yours as you hug and his arms wrap around your whole body. He also calls me pretty every so often. 

We haven’t really talked that much because I still am with my boyfriend &amp; I could never cheat on him. Because I know what that feels like and I know he’ll be heartbroken… but idk if these feels will go away . I am not the type to go for guys who “like to flirt with girls (he did say he’d only flirt with his gf if he had one) but idk why I’m overlooking that flaw.

I have worked out regularly and worked on my diet my whole adult life. I think that's important. I want to meet women who care about their fitness and health the same way.

So people told me to join a gym. 

What a joke. 

I joined the biggest popular gym chain in my area and went to the only location in my area. I've been going every day after work now and while I enjoy it for the more efficient workout than what I can do at home, there are no women there at all.

Every time I go there's at least 30-40 guys working out and at most 1-2 women. Half the few women that come go with their boyfriends who are always 6'3""+ massive hulking monsters.

Also, almost every single person in the gym is half a foot taller than me and weighs 50-100 lb more. 

In short, the gender ratio is 5x worse than even Tinder. And every guy is insanely tall and muscular. Where do all these giants come from? Are they all on steroids? Don't short or average height men work out too?

My conclusion: The gym is a good way to get a fast workout in and also feel extremely small. There is almost zero chance of meeting a woman at one since they don't even go.

It's perhaps not surprising. Every. Single. Thread. Where a guy is talking about trouble dating gets spammed with ""GO TO THE GYM AND GET A 6 PACK BRO!!!"" So it's probably normal only men go. I've never seen women get that advice.

Anyway, if anyone has any better ideas I'm open. This reminds me of when people said ""go to meetups"" and I went to a few and found the exact same gender ratio of at least 10 or 20 men per women.

It was not a loop route and I found myself quite a ways from my house, and it was in the middle of the afternoon and really hot out. I stopped and was walking around looking for a drinking fountain - I was right outside of a museum next to a park, and I saw a girl who worked there that had just sat down (she had just gone on break) so I went up and asked her if there were any drinking fountains around. She said she couldn't think of any, but then picked her stuff up and told me to follow her - she brought me inside to gift shop/bar area and went behind the bar and got me a glass of ice water. 

We both went back outside and she went back to her break spot and I sat down and made a phone call and drank my water. She walked past me on her way back inside after her break; I was still on the phone and we waved at each other. It was at this point when I thought to myself that she was pretty cute.

I went back inside to the bar after I finished the water to get a refill but nobody was working there, so I just sort of hung out and watched the Olympics for a bit. She was working in the gift shop, and after a while she walked past the bar and asked me if I needed a refill. While she was filling me up we talked for a minute, and I noticed her name tag and noted her name, and then she went back to the gift shop and I continued to hang out at the bar wondering what I should do. 

I ended up borrowing a pen from somebody and wrote a short message on a napkin - it was something like ""Thanks for the water! Not sure what your situation is but here's my number."" I could not find her to give it to her but there was another girl working in a different part of the gift shop, so I asked if she knew \[cute girl's name\] and if she could give the napkin to her. She gave me a knowing smirk and said she would, and then I left.

So now its two days later and I have not received any message from her. I know there's all sorts of reasons why she may not have responded, but the fact that I have no idea if she \*actually\* got my message is making it tough to stop thinking about. I know her name and where she works so I know it's possible for me to follow up, but I'm not sure if I should..
