yourself for grammar and formatting mistakes as it is 2:00 am and i’m tired and i’m on my phone. so there’s this one friend, let’s call him bob. bob is one of my closest friends and has been a friend since i was a little kid. he’s 9 months younger than me and has much better social presence and social skills than me so he always had more friends and i was essentially considered friend of friends for the friends that bob was friends with. sorry if that got confusing. moving on, come our 2nd year of college and bob tells me that he has visited his friends dorm (let’s call her becca) and told me that her roommates are gorgeous and one of them is into (my entire persona/ethnicity) so i was like oooh this is enticing so i tell him to invite me next time he goes to visit beccas dorm. let’s call this girl that is into my type georgia.a few weeks pass before bob goes to becca’s and georgias dorm again but this time i go. he told me not to have high hopes because in the few weeks georgia has been seeing a very toxic dude who makes her cry n stuff who is surprisingly the same ethnicity as me but she is head over heels for him. nothing is official at this point and even now i don’t think it is official it’s just a weird situation ship they have and is def very toxic. i met this dude just to be good terms with him but man this dude is a dick. i said wassup to him and he ignores me and continues talking to georgia. by the way let’s call this toxic dude billy. so i accepted my date and thought that was the end of it. back to my boring life. however a month or so later becca and bob say that they’re having a little get together happening at becca’s dorm and i’m invited. this is the first time i ever get to talk to georgia and i was immediately awestruck. for context, i have pretty bad social anxiety and social skills so it is very hard for me to start and keep a conversation but for whatever reason i was able to talk to georgia so naturally and did not need to worry about the next thing i needed to say. also at this get together billy wasn’t here because no one else who lives in becca’s dorm likes him. so that night we all go out for dinner and i’m still talking to this girl and at the end of the night she gives me a hug. i was pretty happy. nothing happens for a while. i don’t see her, until 3 months later when bob is hosting a game night one night (really an excuse to get drunk and have fun) and georgia was invited. at this point she has another situationship, nothing official, with another guy who was also pretty scum but i have no interaction with her this night because i was preoccupied punching the air. this new dude is also somewhat of a bully, i saw him taking videos and fat shaming a friend who was passed out and did not pass out in a graceful position. i didn’t say anything then because i did not wanna cause a scene but georgia was also laughing with him at this point. so after everyone leaves i tell bob and for the next few weeks there is a lot of fighting between friends and it wasn’t the best of times. also during this i was made out to be the instigator for all of this from becca’s roommates because of how becca worded what i had described what happened so it made georgia and her other roommates think this is my fault. eventually everything dies down but i never interact with georgia again until this past weekend. it was a friends birthday party and i had to come dripped to the max. we go out for dinner and i’m wearing a leather jacket. georgia asks me if i’m cold as we arrive to the restaurant and i didnot know where she was getting with this so i said no. afterwards she’s asks me for my jacket and in the midst of this i was also getting dragged to the bathroom by bob because he has something to say. so i kinda ignored her until i came back from the bathroom and she asks again and at this point i give it. and throughout the whole night i was replaying the situation in my head because this is nothing that’s ever happened to me before so i was kinda ecstatic. later in the night she has her phone camera pointed at me and i thought nothing of it and looked away but she says strike a pose i’m trying to take a picture of you so i just do some silly pose and she laughs. that also has never happened to me before. as we arrive back to the dorm she gives me mommy jacket back and as we are leaving she gives me a hug. so that is where i currently am at right now but idk what to do about it/make of the situation. let me know what you think. please.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1159236,public,self,is she

It happened this way that we slept on first date, and then eventually started to go out a lot. Both of us are very busy people, so we also don’t have too much time for personal time and it’s not a priority. He’s like a typical IT guy who has to work 24/7 in order to maintain very successful. I am also recently broken up so honestly I was enjoying my time with this person and didn’t want to give it any labels but to my understanding I’d say it’s “lovers”. We communicate, discuss our lives, hang out and sleep with each other but it’s going pretty slow pace and we never had any exclusivity talk or what we owe to each other. Knowing him pretty much already, I’m pretty sure that he might talk to other women but I’m pretty sure he only does sleep with me. Overall our vibe is romantic, he even gave me some romantic gift for this February 14. 

I have been talking to one more man during this time and there is one that’s a expressing his sympathy for me a lot. He’s coming from another city to meet me. My “lover” gave me a gift on feb 14th but we never went for dinner or met that day. We message like once in 2 days, meet 2ce a week and I don’t know if he’s seeing anybody else. Maybe not, because he’s extremely busy also, maybe yea. 

At the same time, I’m really slow paced now and if “lover” showed me more signs of affection or wanting a relationship, I’d have a talk about exclusivity. But as long as it is the way it is, I go with the flow because I don’t know if I am ready to give up my freedom for him yet.

I am not planning to sleep with a man who’s coming to see me, it’s going to be just some time for us to get acquainted for more romantic long term prospective.

Super cute, pretty nice and I kind of got the vibe that she liked me back. We'd talk about random shit (dont remember what specifically). The only thing that kind of got me was that she didn't really like reading walls of text, but who does. However, she'd always answer with this kind of dumbed-down ""hurr durr idk what you're talking about"" kind of messages like ""huh"" or ""uh ok ig"". And they'd be like super easy to read as well. So the biggest red flag I got was that she would be kind of ignorant and disrespectful and unkind to me when in group chats but she was totally okay talking with me at 1 AM, it just felt like she'd be dissaproved of if ppl knew she was talking to me. It's not even like I was that kid, it was just that nobody knew me.

 So around the end of the school year, we're going back to hybrid/in person and when I talk to her she is kind of brief with her messages, doesn't answer questions, doesn't want to facetime, all kind of irregular behavior.

Fast forward to next school year (full in person), I get my phone number changed for cell plan and carrier shit reasons and she sends me the first message she has in 6 months.

Abby- ""Hi this is Abby""

Abby-""{last name} btw""

me- ""oh hi sup""

Abby-""Oh nothin im just at {mutual friend}'s house. we're having a party""

me-""oh ok""

so basically we talk like this, kind of just small talk and I dont wanna get in an actual conversation because im pretty pissed at this chick at this point. So the next morning I send her this stream of text asking why she did what she did and basically acted like a jerk to me (FYI the whole cold shoulder thing was kind of bad because her behavior in group chats was completely uncalled for like using some pretty crazy language as if I was someone she absolutely hated) and you wouldn't believe what she responded with. ""uh k"". UH K. I asked her a question and this is basically an ""FU I'm not answering"" kind of response. So after this I asked her in one-liners why she did what she did and waited for a response. Basically her schtick was ""well I don't have to have a reason and I dont have to tell you either"". Every day I have to deal with seeing her in the halls from spanish to math, and from science to the doors. Like we have to uncomfortably walk next to each other or somewhere close to each other to get out of the school lmfao. It's a disaster and I need help.

Context: 

LDR relationship

He’s normally a very busy person who stays home and works 7 days a week. He has loads of responsibilities at the moment due to lack of manpower so he assumes responsibility for the absence of people. The day before Valentine’s, I had to remind him about it. He greeted me “Happy Valentine’s Day. I won’t be able to tell you that cuz I’ll be at work by 12am your time”
We usually call twice a day and exchange a few texts in his break. But due to his busy schedule, we can barely make 1 phone call each day. Right now, we talk once every three days and barely exchange messages even on his break. I do feel sorry for him. I’ve expressed my sentiments that communication is vital in our relationship especially because we’re in long distance. Every time I express my loneliness, he apologizes and tries to tell me that he will change his way. 

On Valentine’s Day he said he didn’t have time to call because he had a bad internet. So he attempted to call at midnight but I didn’t see my phone ring andI was still awake at that time and using the phone. He again “attempt” the call an hour later still I didn’t hear the phone ring even though it was beside me. I feel he only placed a missed call so that I would think that at least he tried calling me. Because of this, I feel that he didn’t really wanna talk to me on that “special day” that he and I thought. 

He does have time during the day because his work starts to get busy in the afternoon til evening. This has been going on for a month now where I feel the communication is slowly declining. I was thinking he could at least give me a 2 minute phone call at the end of his shift if he couldn’t make a call during the day. As I said previously, I have told him about how I feel but he doesn’t seem to put any effort into making me a priority too. I understand he is married to his work and I can’t change that because people also have their own lives outside the relationship but without communication from both ends, there’s no relationship. 

I feel abandoned and lonely. He also mentioned before that our honeymoon phase is over. It makes me wonder if he is still interested or is he seeing someone else. He stays home but it’s inevitable for me to worry because we only met online and he could check out girls who he follows on Instagram if he’s already losing interest in me. He likes their pics and comments “❤️❤️❤️” on them. This gives rise to my insecurities. I feel this is the foundation of my doubt for him whether he’s interested in someone else. Maybe he’s too comfortable? Maybe it’s the familiarity? I asked him if he still loves me and he said “I never have doubts about you.”

I wanted any form of reassurance (he stops being affectionate with me and seems cold and distant) but he would complain back that I should give him time for work. I feel bad for being needy so when I ask him something about validating his feelings for me, I try to avoid sounding needy. 

He said it’s normal for a relationship to go from being excited to finally settling with your partner and not need to exert too much effort. We’ve only been 5 months together and I still feel the same way for him as I did in our first month together. It hurt me that he changed into this “phase” so suddenly. Like he no longer needs my presence and reassurance that I’m with him. As long as I’m his girlfriend then he’s fine with it. 

How do I deal with this?

Especially, after my last LTR, I had around 500 dates (+went to clubs, bars, etc.) and I got laid \~15 times, but almost always got ghosted afterwards (the max I managed is 3 weeks). I tried to settle outside of my tastes, and 2 times I dated as gf women who liked me, but they were really not attractive to me, and I had to leave them because sexually it wouldn't do. Of course that came with shame for doing that to them.

No one could ever explain what I'm doing wrong. I think that the more it went and I tried to fix myself, be careful etc. the more I crystallized some faults that I initially made. I took various dating coaches, and they improved what they could; my approaches are great, I worked on my fashion, body and BL too, and I can get many kinds of women, even some who are considered hot, on a date.

I've stopped trying because I ended up resenting women. I've asked to dozens of them with the most effort I could, but I only got an answer from 3, the remaining all ghosted and gave me no chance to improve. I keep reading that you should do your inner work and understand what you're doing to put them off. This feels HUGELY CONDESCENDING: it works if you're minorly awkward or just a little bit off. If you have to guess the whole thing there's no chance. And I've spent many day/nights reading books and watching videos about dating. Also note that it's not that I don't know how to read the cues, oftentimes I get to some ""level"", but then I fail to move up and they lose all attraction.

The only regret I have is not being around the ""cool dudes"" enough. Many people around me are not great with women, and the ones that are I just see that they're more confident and laid back (not neurotic at all), which is extremely hard to emulate.

I guess I just want to rant and see if someone shares my experience. Maybe what they did about it.

I moved out of the family home in 2009 and into a place with my mom in 2011 due to custody. My parents finally got a divorce in 2016 after years of my dad still ""trying to hold on"". My (alcoholic) dad is still in love with my mom but she has moved onto better things since she is much younger, an immigrant, and, now, living in Texas. My dad on the other hand, being the alcoholic old man he is had a stroke and my brother &amp; I had to drop everything to figure out care for him.  He is now disabled and I wish I got more time with him since my last words were to never speak to him again and now he can't speak (non-fluent Aphasia, the irony here is that I am a speech therapist for this kinda thing).

Born and raised with two military vet parents who led a perfect life until his dad cheated on his mom when she had cancer, spent thousands on the other woman, short sold the second house they had, up and moved to the south by himself. The Dad changed his phone number, address, and job, leading his kids to only Facebook for contact. I have the dad on Facebook and it reminds me heavily of when my dad was active on Facebook post-divorce. My boyfriend has consoled in me multiple times that he wishes his dad called and spoke more since my boyfriend thinks he is the reason for the divorce (He never got answers since his dad just up &amp; left). When I first met my boyfriend, his dad was hospitalized multiple times but due to schedule conflicts and time, he couldn't see him. (Similar to my dad's stroke where I had to suck it up and move on)

And leaves me hanging because he made plans. Am I settling for someone who is too self-involved? Or am I overthinking and expecting too much?

I (25f) have been with my boyfriend (29m) for about two years now. In the beginning, everything was perfect. I had to move away within months of dating for grad school and we did long-distance and it went pretty well. He then moved to my city for half a year before moving abroad a month ago.

Since he has been abroad, and since our relationship has gotten more serious, things have been popping up that makes me feel like I am settling. One example is an argument we had the first week he moved abroad. He initially hid who he was hanging out with because it was a group consisting always of only females, specifically one girl and her group of friends. He says he hid this to avoid conflict with me. Logically, I understand but I also made it clear to him it was still wrong and he needs to do something to fix it rather than just say he realized and continue the way he has been. And this was leaving me hanging during the argument because he had plans with the same girls (to go to the beach, that he could not cancel apparently and already postponed for me). This went on for a while: he went out for dinner with the same girl two days later after I said I didn't feel comfortable with him going out alone so soon after finding out he hid her. To which he said he will not let me get in the way of his friendships and that I should stop controlling him and I should not judge her (which I did not even say btw) and he insisted that I was only uncomfortable because I was jealous, hung up, and went for dinner. Till the end, he never actually apologized and just said that he'll try to tell me the truth more often and instead put the blame on me for ""pressuring him"" to update me when he makes plans all the time and that he cant spontaneously decide to go to a club for example because he felt controlled, (the day before the beach he told me he was going to dinner and I didn't hear from him till 2am and texted him to check on him, to find out they ""spontaneously ended up in a club"", which I found super inappropriate considering the circumstances. He disagreed and said he was just being spontaneous and having fun and by being mad, I was making him feel bad). I explained time and time that I wasn't trying to control and the only reason I asked for updates was because, after what happened, I felt it was necessary to build back the trust, to show effort from his side. In the end, I basically gave up explaining my side because I felt it was driving me crazy not being understood and having it turned on me. Don't get me wrong, I do understand that it might be perceived that way by him, but I also explained why it was necessary so he understand. Things then eventually got better, he did update me more, but I still didn't feel understood and frankly felt manipulated. This is a point where I felt for him, he needs to be able to do what he wants, the way he wants to and I need to be okay with it, and only then he'll consider doing something for me, so long as it doesn't get in the way of his life too much..

Situation number two. Two days ago I got an IUD. This is something we've been talking about for months as he doesn't like using condoms and insists I don't take the pill to fck up my hormones and kept pushing the idea of an IUD. I did agree and brought up the cost multiple times but he said nothing to it. Let me point out in advance that I am in no way expecting him to pay for stuff for me and we have been splitting costs since the second date because I decided it was fair, he never said anything against it. So after I got the IUD and paid for it myself, he still hadn't offered to split the cost. So I end up asking him but in a nice manner (i jokingly said that I could give him a contract if he needed, so he can get his part back if we break up) to which he asks it is a joke and when I said no replies ""Oh it's not a joke. Yes sure if that's what you want, we can split it. But next time, talk to me first before spending money if you're planning on splitting it"". And honestly, this pissed me off so much. First, I think normal human manners would mean I shouldn't be the one to ask, but he should actually have offered. Second, I was only asking to split, if he was willing. I did not say he had to. Third, the fact that he turned it into a lesson for me, instead of just accepting and saying yes of course. Fourth, he has been aware of all the appointments I've been making and the fact that I was doing it. Fifth, I am a grad student surviving on scholarship and he has an insane amount of inheritance he's living on that he was once ""afraid"" I'd find out about. His thought process honestly baffles me. I then say I need to leave to calm myself and once I return, he never mentioned it again, goes out all night, and pretends like nothing ever happened. so I still covered the complete cost myself, which shows even more that he actually doesn't really want to? Or can someone be that forgetful?

He is coming across as very selfish to me and it's getting me confused. He's generally a nice sweet guy, but in moments like this, I fear that it will come to a point in the future where his needs just take over and I'm with someone who's only there when it's convenient for them.

I don’t know where else to vent except here, my friends know the situation but I’ve kept on this “I don’t need no man!” act.  We’ve talked for 8 months, but we never really disclosed when we actually dated, it just happened for us. We are both relatively new to the dating scene and so we were newbies. I expressed interest first and he said he was open to the idea. We seemed to be progressing, at least what I thought, and I was fully head over heels. I saw red flags (never gave me words of appreciation even when I confronted him about it, denied having a future with me, saying “we can’t predict the future”) throughout the relationship and even my friends expressed, but I was too in love to  take them into consideration. I’ve spoken to him numerous of times about these red flags yet he has not changed. The final weeks of our relationship were antagonizing. What really triggered it all was him degrading my gift that I made him, knowing that I was really excited to give it to him. When I was watching him opening the gift, he decided to bash and completely degrade it, deeply hurting me. I told him this the next day and he later told me that it was like “stepping on glass.” While he was trying to make me feel better the next few days, he out of the blue says to me, “I don’t know what I think about you.” I was already in the worst state of my life and he KNEW. I cried that night thinking to myself, “What? How could this be? Why so sudden?” My friends told me to break up with him and that I didn’t deserve to be treated like this.. and so the next day, I did. During the FaceTime, he told me that he was questioning me the whole relationship and only stayed because he saw how in love I was and wanted to make me feel better. The second he told me that, I felt this immense pain in my chest, probably my heart being torn to pieces. I have now blocked him for a week which is such a milestone—as stupid as it sounds—but I was highly dependent on him. I am over my grieving stage and now enraged by the whole thing. I can’t even look at him in the eyes now. 

But a part of me wants to go back to him because he was always my comfort person. I felt safe with him somehow, maybe because I get attached easily. I am in a mix of emotions right now and I don’t know what to do. I’ve recently been diagnosed with depression (earlier on in the relationship) and this situation has maximized it.

“I like you as more than a friend.”

“I’ve had feelings for you for a long time.”

To make things worse, guys will follow up  these type of “confessions” with the question of whether she feels the same. 

The answer is almost always a ‘no’, in some shape or form. 

That’s because these type of confessions make women feel cornered—as if someone is suddenly putting a spotlight on them, and is expecting a certain response. Ninety-nine percent of the time they already know if a guy has feelings for them. It doesn’t need to be said.

If you are actually interested in dating her, rather than using her as an emotional sounding board, you have to frame yourself as a potential romantic partner, not creepy friend who vomits his feelings without warning.

- Simply begin to incrementally flirt with her more often. You can’t go from 0-10, it has to be subtle. Also, don’t flirt for the sake of getting a reaction; see if you both have chemistry. Have fun. You might find she isn’t a good fit for YOU beyond friendship. 

- 0-2: make a casual comment about her appearance that you genuinely feel. “You look great when you wear your hair that way”. “You look really cute in that color.” Express it in a way that you didn’t really notice it until now, and that you’re making more of an observation rather than an overt compliment.

- 2-4: The next time you see her, jokingly tease her (not neg), the same way a boyfriend would joke around with his girlfriend. “I don’t know if we’d work as a couple, you’re ridiculous sometimes”. Whatever works in your dynamic; don’t make it as a cutdown to lower her self confidence. You both should be in on the joke. The teasing should be playful, not malicious.

- 4:6: Use subtle, innocent touch when interacting with her. Don’t overdo it. Touch her knee or arm when emphasizing a point in the conversation or making a joke. If you’re walking through a public place, gently touch her back as you navigate through people.

If she seems receptive, then just simply ask her out, not to get coffee as friend, but on an actual date. 

If she says she doesn’t see you as more than a friend, you have your answer. If you don’t want just friendship, then tell her so in an upfront, but respectful manner. Until the feelings fade, keep your distance and keep meeting other women.

I (23F) have been dating this man (28M) for a little over three weeks. We met on Bumble and our chemistry is through the roof. We are both extremely attracted to each other and our personalities mesh so well together. Our first date went so well that he asked me to date him exclusively, so since meeting him we agreed not to date or sleep with other people. We’ve gone out on two dates and hung out twice at my apartment, and each time we’ve hung out has lasted for about 5-7 hours. 

So far I really like him and I feel like it could genuinely go somewhere, which he has also said himself. But I am having a lot of doubts and I need to know if I’m overthinking this or not. 

Basically he works a lot (60-80 hours a week) so he’s obviously very busy. His sister who lives in Dubai was in town the last two weeks so he was even busier hanging out with her. He sends one or two texts a day - granted they are quite long and he usually mentions how he misses me or something along those lines - but still, we have minimal contact. On top of that, his parents live with him because they are immigrants and are looking for a home still, so I haven’t been invited to his house. Lastly, we didn’t spend Valentine’s Day together - it was his sister’s last day in town so he was busy with her. 

My issue here is that I am worried that he is not actually dating me exclusively. The way we interact in person and how he talks to me feels like he is really into me - he has made many “jokes” about us getting married, having kids, how I check off all the boxes for a wife for him, he even mentioned how he would want me to move with him someday if he relocated his job. But I can’t shake the feeling that he’s seeing someone else. A lot of his reasons for being busy seem too coincidental, especially not being able to see me on Valentine’s day or not being able to go to his house.

A few days ago at work, I asked out a co-worker. Before, we talked for about an hour and got to know each other. I knew, or at least I think I knew, that she had a crush on me since she would steal some glances at me and blush whenever I talked to her.

Anyways, after having a pretty good conversation, I decided to ask her out. Fortunately, she said yes! I gave her number, she didn't give me hers since my phone was dead and my memory is shot. A couple of hours later, she texted me asking how I was and if my phone was charged (I joked that my phone was dead). This lead to a mini conversation before I texted if she was available one day to go out. She declined because she was busy with choir and worked all day. I then asked if she was available a couple of days later.

This is where the situation begins, this text conversation happened a couple of days ago and she still hasn't replied. She told me that she has social anxiety and doesn't have a large group of friends. In addition, she told me that no one had ever asked her out before. She is 17 (turning 18 in a few months) and I'm 20 (turning 21 in a couple of months), and before you scream ""pedophile"", yes I am aware that she is a minor.

On V-day we went to a restaurant and he started admitting everything. He slept with one of his friends before he met me, she was in the get together and her and I chatted a bit together. I was so chocked and felt betrayed not because he slept with her, but because he lied to me when I asked if anything has ever happened with the girls before he went on the trip. He also admitted to having kissed or done stuff with girls that are now just friends (he has them on FB). I was so sad I didn’t eat anything and went to have a cry in the bathroom. Needless to say we left right away. He said that he regretted sleeping with her and for this reason he lied to me. It’s true because he showed me a convo with his guy friend where he was expressing how much he regrets sleeping with her.

We are both student workers at a restaurant on our college campus. He's really friendly, but also kind of nerdy. For the first several months, we would talk frequently. At first, I was the one always having to initiate the conversation, so I stopped. I only stopped for a day, though. That day, I said good morning to him when I came in, goodbye when I left, and I'd talk to him for work related stuff, but I didn't go out of my way to speak to him about trivial things. The next day, he came right up to me and started talking to me. He started initiating for a while then.

At work, he would frequently help me, even when I didn't ask for help. There was one time when he asked me what I was doing that weekend (we asked each other that question frequently). I told him, and asked him what he was going to do. He then said that he was going to visit his friend at work. He said ""I'm not going to say no to bothering someone at work. I already bother you enough. Or maybe I should bother you more?"" I didn't know he was flirting then, but I do now.

Two weeks later, I invited him to my birthday party. I figured what better way to show him that I'm interested than by inviting him? I messaged him on Instagram. He messaged me back saying he wasn't sure, but that he'd let me know in a couple of days. That week at work, he was acting kind of distant. He wasn't necessarily cold, just not quite as receptive as he had been before. He told me later that he wasn't able to make it. For the next couple of weeks, he was distant. I never knew what I was going to get with him. Some days, he was talkative like always, and other days, he was avoidant. Keep in mind, the same week that I invited him to my birthday party, he accepted a promotion at work, so he has the title of department lead. Department lead is basically like assistant manager.

After about three weeks of the behavior, he's been acting somewhat back to normal again. Because of the new semester, our schedules don't match up as much anymore, so we see each other less often at work. However, he's been friendly like before. Today, I said hi to him, he said hi back, and I had to go sanitize tables. When I came back, he gave me a hi five and asked me how I'm doing. Today is Valentine's Day, and it could be a coincidence, but he's never done that before. We usually just say hi and that's it. In fact, he doesn't like touching people in general. At least, I've never seen him voluntarily touch any other coworkers.

This has been on my mind for a long time and wanted a place to get it out.

Simply put, I live in the Mojave Desert and it's incredibly hard to date people for numerous reasons.

About me: I split with my ex-wife of 8 years in late 2019 (my choice) while living in San Francisco. Took time to work on myself and process the trauma of being with an abusive partner, all while continuing my profession in Event Production. (You may know where this is going). The pandemic happened, no more events, Unemployment ran out, and I moved back in spring of last year to the house that My ex-wife and I owned before finalizing the divorce in the Mojave. My ex-wife still resided in the bay area and I would be by myself to get to my next career in video production.

I met back up with many of friends that I hadn't seen in a few years and met the new people that arrived on the seen. I attempted to date out here but ran into many road blocks. The first being that I'm in my mid 30s and mostly everyone is in their mid 40s out here. Though, I love and get along well with the people here, I often get the sense that I don't belong no matter how much I put myself out there.

There is also this sense that a lot of people come to a remote place like this to work on themselves. Which is good, but it can also means for many of the women that I've spoken to, that they're not opening themselves up to be romantically involved with anyone for that healing process.

Then with dating apps, In the past year, I've met 2 people for coffee (which is an 1 1/2 hour drive to Palm Springs) and was stood up once with another person (at least I watched Dune in Imax that day to make up for the time spent driving).

This all brings me to the past few weeks. A woman I spoke to at a restaurant that I work at last year and disappeared, popped back up. I met with her at her place for coffee, she came back to the restaurant I work at for brunch, then we hung out at a bar in town for 3 hours (the first date I'd been on in probably 2 years).... which is where I got put back onto my heels.

She let me know half way in the date 2 reasons why we're most likely not going to be able to be in a relationship. 1: She dated a guy with my name that had similar mannerisms. 2: She ""legitimately"" hears a voice once in a while that lets her know to do. Career choices, moving, relationships, etc... And she hadn't heard the voice with me. (btw: I think it's brilliant in a Larry David kind of way to get out of any situations you don't want to be stuck in). It was like going to a meeting to get the big sale, and then the customer tells you that they're uninterested in buying, but keep going with the presentation. I was in my head the last of the date, second guessing everything I said wondering what would be the thing that would gain her interest. We hugged before saying goodbye. Any possible boldness I had to kiss her that night vanished with those reasons. (In hindsight , I should have excused myself to the restroom to shake it off and take some deep breaths rather than just trudging forward).

Anyway, I spoke to her over the phone a couple of days later and had a what I thought was a good conversation to make up for any short comings during the date. But now it's gone cold. Just a couple of unanswered text messages.

Now that familiar feeling of loneliness, feeling undesirable, and disappointment in myself for letting feminine attention rule my self esteem.

With anything, this is just scratching the surface. There is always much more to talk about and explain, but just wanted to process these feeling in some sort of public format.

My experience is, if you are being authentic, women won't like you. If you manipulate, play ""power games"", ""seductive games"", you win, and it seems like you have to keep playing it, even after you get into a relationship, otherwise, you are going to be left for someone who is better, richer, and has more status. This doesn't count for EVERYONE. Let me make that perfectly clear. This is MY experience. 

Dating is like a job interview nowadays; it is all about impressing, exaggerating stories to appear more attractive, deceiving people into liking you, manipulating. I do not want to partake in that deceiving shit.

I wish I could take a time machine back to the 90-00s before Tinder was a thing, so I simply could ask someone out in real life rather than wasting weeks on someone just to be ghosted. Apparently, I didn't check out in all 100 requirements, this person had. You can't approach someone and ask them out without being convicted of rape. 

If a woman is homeless, a millionaire would save her, but if a man is homeless, a woman wouldn't even look at him.

Sorry for this little temper tantrum, but Jesus, I am so fed up with all of this as someone who has autism and doesn't understand the games people play. Some games are not worth playing, so I will invent my own and be me, and people can accept me for who I am or fuck off. I am open and direct. I don't like texting for a month. I just want to arrange a little date in a public area and that way, we can see if we are made for each other like two normal human beings. None of this alpha male bullshit.

Hello everyone. So I have been officially dating this girl for about 4 days, we’re both 17 and she has a sister who has just turned 20. Everything is good I really like her and I never ever want to do stuff with anyone else other than her. 

The issue is, is that her sister is extremely attractive and I have sometimes been fantasising about her when I masturbate. I am ashamed of it and I don’t know what I should do because I really like this girl but I feel like I’ve betrayed her. I even looked at some of her Instagram photos once. 

I know it’s bad and I am ashamed of it but I don’t really know what I should do. I would never ever consider cheating (like I would even get the chance too.) or anything and it’s all just fantasy but I feel terrible about it. I’ve never met her sister but I still know it’s wrong and I am simply ashamed. I’m never ever going to do it again because I know it’s wrong.

I know the rules change when it’s someone’s family but my girlfriend said she does not care if I think of other people or masturbate to anything other than her as long as I want her more than anyone else (which I of course do)

We started talking on an app over a month ago and were in different cities. Quickly set up FaceTime calls to chat and the chemistry was amazing- texting back and forth and he even offered to help me on my job search. Fast forward, it’s finally the weekend that I fly into the city that he’s in ( staying with old college friends and catching up, but a small part of me also came to see him as well). 

He asked me early in the week what I wanted to do this weekend and I suggested dinner, to which he agreed and asked when whether Saturday or Sunday worked better for me. I said Sunday because my flight was early Saturday morning , but I’m not opposed to Saturday either - especially if the super bowl is important to him. 

He responded and said let’s plan for Sunday since the week leading up to Sat will be pretty busy at work, and super bowl plans are TBD. So I said okay let’s do Sunday then, but can we confirm on Friday night? He agreed. 

I didn’t hear from him from since his last text Thursday night asking me if it’s was T-1 days to my flight. Saturday night rolls along and he still hasn’t responded to me so I text again, saying what’re we thinking for tomorrow? He responds at 2am Sunday (today) saying - Sorry work got busy and I just wrapped up a little while ago. I have to go home tomorrow morning to help my parents out and the rest of the day will be eaten up by superbowl stuff unfortunately. Can we do early next week or when I get back from my work trip next Saturday?

I’m extremely annoyed and feel disrespected. What do I say? I wish he gave me a heads up that he had plans tonight to watch the game- I would’ve been totally okay with that.

Then he suggested early this week or the weekend after he gets back from his work trip. I said Monday or Tuesday - and he told me it had to be Tuesday since he leaves Wednesday for his trip. But said “ Tuesday might work” we texted through Tuesday and never once did he tell me that he can’t do dinner, only told me how busy he was. Thank goodness I had zero hope I’d actually see him that day cause I would have been disappointed.

For example, things like leaving her friends and coming over to talk to me multiple times, sending one of those anonymous online letters (which I later discovered it was her) saying that she was happy that we met and complementing me, friendly chemistry etc.

Well from the start I didn't want to ask her directly since she comes from a conservative muslim family, meaning that asking her out is a big no-no. So, instead, I asked if she wanted to work together on a mutual project and from then on see what the chemistry is like. 

So far, I'm starting to be convinced that I might've been wrong. At first she's slow to respond over text, the conversation isn't exactly dry but it isn't exactly much fun either, it's not going anywhere. We were supposed to have a meeting with a third-party around a few weeks ago, before the meeting she texts that the place was too far and if I would be ok handling the meeting alone. This was the tipping point. From then on we only talk when it's about the project, even when I tried to talk about something else she would continue the conversation a bit but eventually we're back to business. 

But you know what's funny? The past week we texted a few times for hours (the most being 4 straight hours very late at night??), we started with business then started talking about other random topics then we talked about each other's family and childhood stuff. Those times I felt it was a lot more reciprocal and fun. One time I tried to end the conversation and said that ""I had fun but I didn't want to keep you busy"" and she said ""I'm not busy at all, I'm really enjoying our conversation"" and we continued for another hour. She almost never texts first, most of the time I initiate but when I do we would spend hours texting and I get the feeling she doesn't want to stop? Tbh I'm even less sure and more confused, is she into me or is she just being friendly/shy now? 

I realize that I really do like her. But I don't want to take any steps that would make things awkward later. I apologise for making this whole thing an essay but I need advice please. Basically how to either move forwards with this or move on.

Tldr: I liked a girl who I thought liked me back. Through working together on a project I'm suspecting that I was wrong. Recent events makes me think otherwise? Is she just shy maybe? I want advice on how to move forward or move on.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1159293,public,self,Interested in [23F] but not sure if she's also interested in me [24M] or just being friendly/shy?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/su0z0r/interested_in_23f_but_not_sure_if_shes_also/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,

I'm a 24 year old guy who's socially awkward and has never been in a relationship before, and only a handful of dates over the past few years. In 2019 I started talking to this guy on tinder. He was basically the perfect guy, at least to me. He was very attractive and talented, a former model, he could sing and play a lot of instruments. He told me when we matched that he thought I was very attractive and hot, and that I was the cutest guy in town. We started messaging each other on snapchat and he started talking about how he wants to do all kinds of dirty things to me. I told him that I don't like to talk sexually with someone when I don't know them that well, we've only been talking for a few days at most at that point. He told me that I made it seem like I didn't want to have sex with him, and that I should because I know that he likes me. I told him that I would like to have sex with him, but that I to take things slow, and said he understood.

He went on a first date and it went really well. We had lunch at a diner and then made out, which was my first time. We lived an hour away from each other and he told me that he usually wouldn't drive that far to meet someone and that he didn't think he'd be trying to get into a relationship so soon after his last one ended a few months before then, but that there was something about me that changed his mind on those things, and he held my hand for a bit while he drove me home.

We kept texting afterwards and the told me me that he's obsessed with me and falling for me, how he can see himself spending his life with me, (things no one's ever said to me before) and how the reason other dates I went on didn't lead to another one was because no one else is as smart as me, and that he's probably my perfect match. I told him about bad experiences I've had with people on dating apps before and he said that I must attract crazy people, but now I have him, and he'll sing me to sleep at night. I was elated to have this guy so into me. It was everything I've been wanting for years. 

He told me about how his family was being kicked out of their house by their aunt. He texted me at the bank before he was about to find out if he could get a loan for a new house for his family and I sent him encouraging texts. He told me that I was his sunshine and that he liked how attentive I was.

We planned a second date and he said that he wanted to have sex with me on the second date, and that we'd be boyfriends if it was good. I was a little hesitant, since I'm a virgin and he told me that he was well endowed. He said that I just had to get over it. He also wanted it to be unprotected, saying that he wanted to cum in me.

One day I brought up that I wasn't sure if we were sexually compatible, since he told me a few times that he needed to know if his sexual needs would be fulfilled if we were dating and I didn't really want to have sex with someone that I only knew for a few weeks. He said that he couldn't be with someone who was debating whether they wanted to be with him or not. I really liked this guy and didn't want to lose him, so I sent him a bunch of texts begging him to reconsider. I know it was a very desperate move and I'm not proud of it or justifying it. He said that I acted crazy and made him lose all his feelings for me, and that maybe he could get them back if  I had sex with him. I was going to at first, but after a few days I realized that I didn't want to do that, still wanting my first time to be with someone that I knew for a bit and had a good established connection with, and also we would have had to have sex in his car since his family was losing their house and I couldn't have sex at my house since I still live at home too, and I wanted my first time to be in a bed, and we stopped talking.

Since then I went between thinking that he just wanted to have sex with me to being upset that I lost a really attractive guy who really liked me, the first time anyone's liked me like that in my life. A few months ago I wanted to know for sure, so I messaged him on social media and asked him if he actually liked me and I ruined it or if he just wanted to sleep with me, and he said that he really did like me at first, and then I ruined it. I regret asking. I know it's dumb to ask a question and then get upset when the answer isn't what I wanted, but I don't like knowing for certain that I ruined things and I'm having trouble coming to terms with it.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1159297,public,self,I ruined things with someone who really liked me for the first time in my life,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/su15g6/i_ruined_things_with_someone_who_really_liked_me/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,

1. Don’t be afraid to approach. Most Women like it when you take initiative and approach without hesitation.

2. Do not ask for her number straight away, start by striking up a conversation with her. If she engages with you, keep going, if not, leave her alone. 

3. At the end of the conversation, if you both have had a good conversation, ask for her number. Don’t pressure her into agreeing, if she’s hesitant, assure her that if she doesn’t want to, she free to refuse.
