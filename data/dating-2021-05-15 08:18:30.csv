He says that he is very emotionally unavailable person due to past trauma. I understand the importance of protecting your feelings but why get on a dating app if you are not ready to meet someone? Why involve me and tell me hey I can't be there for you? 

Also, this is making me question if I am a person who is emotionally too available? Is that even a thing? Like obviously if I start liking someone I will care about them and their feelings.

3,ncz2ul,1621085884,Am I being blown off?,"I met this girl through mutual friends about 1.5 months ago. We’ve been on a date together which ended in a kiss. When I asked her about a second date, she said that she’d love to go on one. 

The problems have started when trying to arrange this second date. At first I proposed Wednesday last week, but she said her friend was hosting a leaving party so she wouldn’t be available. The party never happened. I don’t know if it was canceled or there never was a party, but I didn’t bother overthinking on it and just went on with my day. 

Later on that week, I moved into my new apartment and invited her to come and see it on the weekend. She said that on that day she’d be out of town, but she’d be arriving back late that night and if I was still awake she could possibly come to see it. I told her I had no plans that night except finishing off the move and that I’ll send her the address on the day and she said, “Great, I’ll let you know :)”. 

In my experience, “I’ll let you know” is always a no. And now, I’ve had other plans come up, so I’d prefer a more definite answer from her so that I can decide what to do. Should I just send her the address and ask for a definite yes or no so that I can make other plans if she’s not interested?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ncz2ul/am_i_being_blown_off/
4,ncz3nn,1621085955,"A serious question: what is we are more than friends, but I don't have any feelings for you mean?","I am truely interested in other people's perspective, because in my eyes either you are friends or you are more than friends which means you have feelings. Before anybody tells me he was just using me for sex, I want to stress that we did not have sex. Not that we didn't have any sexual chemistry, I just didn't want to sleep with him really soon and it kind of exploded when I started asking what we were doing. 

Was he just not interested in me in that way? But then why the dates, the romantic music texts and the 'today was about making you smile' type comments, why the I don't want to say 'yes' now and then 'no' later (regarding a relationship) or the I don't see myself in a relationship? If you are even thinking about those things don't you have feelings? 

I am just utterly confused. I have the initial reaction to assume someone would not be interested in me, so I can't picture me completely missing the signals that he wasn't interested? It truely all went downhill, when we had an amazing 12 hour day together. I don't think there is anybody else, there might be you never know, but I don't think so. And the downhill was kind of unexpected as well, it was as if he became distant all of a sudden without a warning. 

I have accepted that he doesn't have feelings for me and doesn't want a relationship. Sure, it still hurts, but I guess I am just trying to learn something from this. I learned to give up sooner, that if it is going downhill don't try to save it, if you are the only one who is trying to save it. I learned that relationships are a two-way street, I can't make it happen on my own. I learned that I can truely love someone deeply, sadly it was someone who didn't feel those things for me.

I am genuinely confused by the amount of generalizing genders here. There are definitely a lot of individual situations posed here, but there is so much ""why do women do this?"" or ""all men do this"" even though it's literally a rule not to do this here. To me, this makes no sense. Every experience I have had dating has been different because each individual is different. Even though I have had similar experiences with different people, they were still very different people. It really concerns me that people could view entire genders as stereotypes or base their perceptions of them on a few experiences. I will say it's different to me if you've experienced actual trauma at the hands at the hands of someone, and I am not talking about that. But rather, things like being rejected for a few dates or ghosted and saying ""all women/men care about is looks"" or something. To me, that is incredibly unattractive because it comes off as bitter and I would think that you're not viewing people as actual people and just assuming what they'll do because of your past experiences. If you focus so much on that and let it affect your self worth, how would you be able to consider yourself ready to try and date new people? I am not trying to be mean here, I am just trying to understand what people's perspectives are and why they think this way.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nczud3/why_is_there_so_much_generalization_of_genders/

17,nd0ljk,1621090302,How to find out if it's possible to be friends with a person who you went out with,"
Being new in town, I use dating apps both to meet new people, and if something romantic develops organically it would be a definite plus. 

However, my experience was that most guys I met, even if they say initially that they're happy with the idea of exploring friendship, they almost always treat things on the basis of romantic prospects. So they either like me and wouldn't settle for being just friends, or don't feel attracted to me enough so they don't explore friendship, regardless of the good basis we might have for it. That never bothered me though, since there wasn't so far anything too special for me to be annoyed for losing. I also appreciate that I'm meeting them within the dynamic of OLD, so I should expect that to an extent, even if my profile clearly communicated what I mentioned. 

Nonetheless, I met a guy with whom I clicked on multiple level. that has not happened with me for a long long time. Now I do want good friends, as much as I would like to find a partner. However, my learning experience with OLD makes my expectations sway to the romantic side. We met few times, and despite we did not get physical at all, the cues I received from his body language and how he looked and smiled at me fondly for ages each time were very clear that he was into me, which I can't usually miss, as I'm normally good at reading people. Over the few meetups we had, our conversations and activities would just keep going, and the meeting would last for hours and hours without us wanting it to end.  He was also always keen to secure the next meetup immediately. I haven't had that much fun in a while, which he mentioned several times as well expressing that he always had a lovely and great time. Reading those cues, I instinctly sent mirroring messages, mostly unintended through my body language, but without trying to push or initiate anything. I was simply having fun in a relaxed way. He then started to go silent for a few days until he contacted me over text to say that although he really enjoyed the time we have spent together and feels very comfortable around me, but due to a very troubled past relationship, he does not think that he is ready for a relationship and does not want to waste my time and lead me on. I mentioned that I'm not particularly looking for a relationship and wouldn't jump into one any time soon, although I felt attracted to him. I left it with him thanking him and wishing him good. He never replied to that. 

After processing that by talking to some friends. I can safely say that I haven't developed feelings for this person. However, the level of compatibility and the quality of the time we had together was amazing. I always had close male friends, and got on very well with them. But in this new place with the pandemic and lockdowns, I haven't managed to have that yet, and I do feel like it's something that I really want to have in my life. I would really like if I could check whether there's a possibility to switch whatever that I had with him into a friendship, but I don't feel like the way the conversation had ended has left room for me to check that possibility. Going through the events again, I find myself confused to whether he is open to the idea of being friends, or is it another case where it's either romance or nothing.

For those who beared to read all this, thank you, I would appreciate any comment or input. Do you think I could explore this further without sending a wrong message?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nd0ljk/how_to_find_out_if_its_possible_to_be_friends/

19,nd0vrd,1621091081,I'm (34/M) Seeking advice on how to stop seeing someone without hurting her (35/F),"I'm looking for advice on my dating situation with a woman I like. We met about one month ago and have been on a few dates and have hung out at my place a few times as well. On the second date and all times after she's really pushed and insinuated wanting to have sex. In past relationships I was quick to do that without getting to know them sooner and it partly led to the downfall in those relationships, of course in my experience. I've told her each time that I'm not ready or that I want to get to know her more, but she still tries and makes some moves, and I wind up feeling horrible for denying her. I mean, I want to as well, I just know it'll lead to a greater emotional connection but I feel that connection will be incomplete. Through my time with her, or maybe just with regards to her, I'm not feeling ready for a relationship as much as I thought I was.

I also feel I've learned enough about her to make me not want to go further into a relationship with her, but maybe I'm wrong for that. For instance she wants someone to manage her life and that's not something I'm comfortable doing, such as managing her money. She has mentioned what she's into sexually and its not exactly something I'm wanting in that area. She also has some form of dissociation possibly where she likes to attend events for little kids where she feels she can act like a little kid (that's fine and all, but I was in a relationship before where that went way over the top and its not something I'm wanting to be involved with again). Unfortunately I've also found she has poor hygiene in general. Finally, she is still on some kind of speaking terms with her ex enough for him to still pay some of her bills or her owe him in that regard. To me these are all red flags/things I'm not comfortable with. I'm sure she likely has issues with things from me as well, not denying that.

I know this is just from my perspective and not her's but I'm looking for some advice on how to end things properly and not hurt her. She's really nice, sweet, beautiful, has a great personality; has been through a lot, and we do otherwise have a lot in common. I just don't feel how I think she feels towards me.

I admit that I’m very insecure person. I mean, trust him. I just don’t know how to fix this brain of mine. Also, I always think that he’s no good when he’s with me.

27,nd1emc,1621092565,No getting it....pleaaase no vulgar comments shit can be stressful enough,"I have been with my wife for 3 years we've been married for 2 years... I am a big guy not sloppy or anything in my wife is a thicker woman since I've known her 5 years ago always been attracted to bigger men so my size is not a problem

I will say that even though we've known each other about five years we did get married pretty quickly into the relationship.

To be honest she does NOT SUCK DICK!! We have tried counseling I even asked her if it made her uncomfortable she said no. I mean sore nothing traumatic happened in her past she said no because he pretty much tell each other everything. I made sure I was good and up the hygiene. She is very big on hygiene so if there was a problem I'm pretty sure she would tell me about it because she's very upfront. Great woman great personality very precise hard worker.... I don't know what it is you just doesn't want to do it I mean like I said if it was a valid reason then I would never ask and I will be respectful of it

As far as sexually I do everything.. My 8.5 works fine!! Eat ass suck toes you name it it!! ...  but on her and she said it is something that she's simply just ""doesn't do""
 Keep in mind he hasn't done it in the past two men that she was not married to him and even when we were friends she said I would not do that unless I am married well? Now she's married and doesn't do it LOL

It is not exactly a deal-breaker but it could bring some awkwardness like when I go to have sex getting my dick sucked for about 10 seconds we can really add to the pleasure of the sex... it is like I just have to hurry up and get it hard and stick it in it is like I do all the work LOL...

There are quite a few women who just want to suck me off I'm like damn should I let them? When you love somebody this can be very confusing",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nd1emc/no_getting_itpleaaase_no_vulgar_comments_shit_can/
28,nd1fsl,1621092658,I am very inexperienced. We've been chatting on instagram but I wanna talked to her on the phone.,"*a lot of this is me setting up how inexperienced I am so sorry if it's a bit boring

I have never been on a date. I'm 21 and have social anxiety and depression. Not a single date with anyone. My last and only girlfriend was back in 9th grade and it lasted 4 weeks, we didn't even talk much and we hugged a couple of times. So I don't even really count that honestly.

-----Sob story-----
-Continued- But that relationship really screwed me up because she had suicidal issues and sometimes relied on me to convince her not to 'do it', not in an aggressive/manipulative way but a wanting advice on why she shouldn't 'do it'. I'm 13 at the time and my social anxiety was at its peak, and even translates over text. The anxiety and depression and this  whole story is something that I am dealing with on my own, with a therapist and with medication. And I am getting great practice at my job.
--------------------------

All of that ^ means I haven't even kissed a girl either. This brings me to now. I am at the best point in my life physically (I've started to actually show a teeny but of muscle) and mentally (can talk better with people-still anxious all the time but better then same time last year), but still have a great deal to improve upon(I'm trying to be positive). Anyway, she approached me at work and asked if I was single and gave me her number. She was temporarily working there and it was her last day so I guess she thought she'd take her shot. This was crazy to me, I thought I was suppose to make the first move but hey I ain't complaining. So we texted a bit that night. The next day (yesterday) we spoke for hours (texting) so it was slow, had to wait for her to respond and stuff, but it was fun and engaging. We transitioned half way through from texting on the phone to...texting...on Instagram.

Basically I wanna talk more to her but I wanna get through more conversation, maybe I'm trying to rush it too much, but she's super nice. There's so many questions I want to ask her. 

----The question-----
I wanna show her I can be confident, and that she doesn't need to make the first move everytime. Is it appropriate in this generation to ask to call her to talk instead of texting? (Does this count as a first date? Would I be expected to do something special like ask her out properly on this phone call? I have so many small questions that probably I need to find out as we go along.) I'd prefer this so I can get more comfortable with her in conversation without meeting in person just yet. 

Any advice in this question or in conversation etc. is much appreciated.
----------------------------

Plus sooooo many more questions relating to the first date, but I guess that would have to wait for later if I get to that part.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to a sports bar with a few friends a couple of days ago to watch a football game between Manchester United and Liverpool (Liverpool won 4-2, I'm a Liverpool fan btw). I'm a pretty big guy (201cm/6'7"" ; 120kg/260lbs) and I can consume large quantities of beer before getting drunk. My friends are also good drinkers but one of us wasn't drinking, so we ordered a beer tower (8 pints per tower) when we got there thinking it would last until the end of the game. The first half went by pretty well but we realised by halftime that we had almost finished the tower, so we decided we would need to order another one for the second half. We were also starting to get hungry, so I decided to order some chicken bites to share. The second beer tower arrived as the second half started, but by the 60th minute of the game, the food still hadn't arrived so I decided to go investigate.

A bit of info about the bar: it's a sports bar in the UK, and at the time of going, pubs and bars were only allowed to have people outdoors because of COVID. This means that inside is really calm and quiet and you don't have to shout to be heard. Customers are usually only allowed in to go to the bathroom, as you order everything on an app or with a waiter that comes to your table.

Back to the story. I walked up to the bar and spoke to the first person I saw behind the counter which happened to be this very pretty girl that I immediately took a liking to. I told her that I had ordered some food and I was wondering how much longer it would take to arrive. She immediately informed me that the kitchen was closed so they couldn't take any food orders and couldn't make any food because the chefs had already left. She then checked the app and the orders that had been received to see what had happened to my order. It turns out my order had been accepted and paid for, but for some reason, it hadn't been processed by the kitchen and therefore had not been made. I was starving when I heard this, so you can imagine my disappointment upon hearing that I would have to find another way to feed myself. I think she noticed this too and clearly felt sorry for me, so she offered me some bourbon biscuits (British chocolate biscuits, look them up if you don't know) which I laughed off thinking she was joking. To my surprise, she was genuine and got out a packet of bourbons from her bag and handed me the packet telling me to take some. Then to my even bigger surprise, she canceled and refunded my order and then offered me a free pint of my choosing. I was proper surprised by how nice she was being and gladly accepted the free pint. We started talking a bit while I slowly ate the bourbons (they are very hard to eat when you've had beer all evening), and chatted a bit about bartending and how we both enjoy it. Then at one point, Liverpool scored and half the bar erupted in joy while the other half slumped down in despair, as the game was all but over (4-2 with a couple of minutes left). Being behind the bar, she couldn't see the score so she asked me for it. When I told her, she was clearly disappointed so I asked semi-rhetorically if she was a United fan. When she replied she was a Liverpool fan, I dumbfoundedly told her that we were winning 4-2, not realising I had just ruined the prank her co-workers had been playing all night. Her face lit with joy upon hearing this and we spoke a bit about football.

When I finally finished my bourbons, she asked me if I was interested in some sweets to which I replied enthusiastically, my stomach still craving the food I had promised it by ordering chicken bites. She told me she would bring some sweets to my table when she took her break to go smoke. Understanding the cue to vacate the bar, I headed back to my table all joyous about how kind she had been to me and the nice conversation I had had with her. As I walked back to my table, the 2 neurons in my head started to connect and I realised she might have been flirting with me.

Now one thing to know about me is I am a very shy person and I am oblivious to any signals a woman might give me and am clueless about flirting. So whenever my brain tells me there is a chance someone was flirting with me, I brush it off as them being polite and I never make a move as I am petrified of misunderstanding the situation and coming off as a creep or worse.

&amp;#x200B;

When I got back to my table, the game was over, and there were only about 2 pints of beer left in the second beer tower. My friends all looked at me and one of them asked me where I had been for the past HALF HOUR. At this point, I had registered the conversation with the cute bartender as having lasted only 5 minutes, so the realisation that I had spent 30 minutes talking to her increased the likelihood that my brain was right and she WAS flirting with me. I immediately told my friends about the past half hour and the possible flirting with the bartender, hoping they would be able to tell me if she was or wasn't flirting with me. Upon hearing my tales, they all confirmed it was very likely to be flirting, which sent my heart racing and my mind into overdrive as I tried to process what had happened and what I was supposed to do next.

Luckily, I was interrupted in my thoughts by a hand tapping on my shoulder. When I turned around I was face to face with the person that sent my mind into panic mode. She smiled and gave me a half-opened pack of jelly cherries (sweets from Tesco) and told me to enjoy them. I was on autopilot when I thanked her and smiled back as she left to go smoke a cigarette.

When I turned back to my table, my friends all smiled at me and one of them said it was definitely flirting because she wouldn't give her own pack of sweets on top of bourbons, a free pint, and a refund to someone just because she was kind and polite. I tried to process the whole situation and as I slowly realised that they were probably correct and she was flirting with me, a huge grin appeared on my face. I got back to talking to my friends and socialising, but my brain was now trying to figure out what to do next and how to talk to her again. A few minutes later, two of my friends left to go home leaving just myself and another friend to finish the two remaining pints of beer before we left too. At one point I brought up the topic of speaking to her again, and mentioned that the best scenario I had come up with was to walk up to her and give her my number and say something along the lines of ""can I repay you for being so kind to me tonight by buying you a drink?"". He laughed at the cheesiness of that sentence and told me I should just be myself because that's who I was when she flirted with me and ask her for her number before leaving. This however was inconceivable for me because I had never successfully asked a girl for her number before and therefore any time I would ever ask a girl for her number would end up the same way: rejection. I continued to mull over the idea of asking for her number and tried to find the perfect way to do so, unsuccessfully.

When we finished the last drop of liquid courage, I realised that it was now or never and I couldn't spend the next decade thinking about how to ask for her number. My friend got up and said he had to use the bathroom, and realising I had to do the same, I followed him to the bathroom. When we walked out of there, I looked towards the bar and saw her in the corner. She saw me, we locked eyes and both smiled. She walked to the part of the bar that I would have to walk past to go out and continued smiling at me.

At that point, days, weeks, months, and years of experiences where I didn't have the courage to make a move, do the thing, talk to a girl, go on a roller coaster, jump off the highest diving board, talk in front of a crowd, dance in a party or club, introduce myself to new people, and so many other situations where I lacked the courage or the will to do something came flashing back at me.

I stopped in front of her and smiled. ""thanks for being so kind to me tonight"". She smiled back and said it was her pleasure. I paused as I tried to muster up the courage to ask for her number.

&amp;#x200B;

At that moment I realised it was now or never. I realised if I don't do this now, I probably won't get another opportunity to do so and I'll spend the next decade dreaming about ""what if"" and wondering what could have been. I realised that I can't keep waiting for things to happen to me. I realised I need to go out of my comfort zone and seek what I want. I realised that the worst that can happen is she says no. And that might sound like the end of the world, but let's be real for 5 seconds. Is it really the end? All that will happen is I'll walk out of there a better and more experienced version of myself. There won't be anyone there to mock me and humiliate me. No one will film it and post it on social media. The world doesn't care about me being rejected. No one cares about it. Everyone has their own problems to deal with. I realised that all the things I hear when I listen to David Goggins, Joe Rogan, Yes Theory, Jocko Willink, James Smith, and all these other people who share their story in the hopes of helping others improve their lives and become better versions of themselves are true.

It's all in the mind. All the barriers that would stop me from speaking to someone or asking for someone's number are in the mind. Nothing is actually stopping me from doing what I want and going outside of my comfort zone to seek a better life.

So I jumped into the unknown.

""Can I give you my number so that I can take you out for a drink to say thanks for tonight?""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The 2 seconds between the end of my question and her answer felt like time had frozen. My mind raced and jumped to all the possible scenarios that flashed in front of my eyes and each one seemed worse than the previous one.

And then I heard two words that sent my world crashing down on me and everything I thought I knew suddenly meant nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""With pleasure""

&amp;#x200B;

If it weren't for the fact I was in public and I don't know how to do one, I would have done 15 backflips out of sheer joy and happiness. I felt like I could run the MOAB 240 in under 1 hour or benchpress a car. I felt so light that I started to worry I'd float off into the atmosphere.

&amp;#x200B;

I collected my thoughts as I came to the realisation that she did want me to give her my number. I took out a pen from my pocket and scribbled down the 11 digits of my phone number, making sure they were all correct and legible, before handing her the piece of paper with it. At that point, I realised that her coworkers had noticed the scene and had started teasing her about it. I chuckled to myself realising that she was probably also very nervous before I asked her. She took the piece of paper and put it somewhere safe as I thanked her and said my goodbyes.

When I walked out of there, I realised how important what I had just accomplished was for my personal growth and wellbeing. I was a new man. She texted me a little later and said she'd let me know when she's free when she gets her new rota.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

All this to say, the only thing stopping you from getting out of your comfort zone is your mind. No matter what happens, you'll feel better and be prouder of yourself and learn to love yourself more if you push yourself and do the things you're scared of doing.

You control your mind, not the other way round. Only you can push yourself and seek out what you want in life. No one will do it for you. You need to trust yourself",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nd1yqn/i_went_out_of_my_comfort_zone_to_talk_to_a_girl/

Obviously that means no to dating and I’m not trying to wait around and orbit to see if she would change her mind, but if she really liked me will she change her mind when I start dating other people? Not in a manipulative way. Like a “you never know what you got till it’s gone,” kind of thing? I’m also asking cause I’m a bit confused, when she said that, I said, “So no dating?”, and she said “Not right now because XYZ and it’s just not the right time and...” yadayadayada (you get the jist). Got a little confused after that and before she left I asked just to clarify, “So no dating?” waiting for a yes or no but she said “Not right now” AGAIN. So like A).

Hello. 

So there is this guy down my church, a popular church in central london. A year and a half ago, we were friends, but he was rather socially awkward, he has ADHD, I thought he would struggle in party situations so I didn't invite him but others, he found out, he started avoiding me, he was friendly about it though, I apologized, we got on and he confessed he liked me. I rejected him. But we got on after, I went away for work for a year and a bit. 

I went back 2 weeks ago, I saw him, he's lost a lot of weight, more sociable, more popular with women and very attractive. Etc. I was happy for him. But everytime I try to talk to him, he's friendly but says he needs to go or he needs to talk to someone else, smiles and leaves. He sees me in the distance at church and uses the back entrance. I don't understand, I was so friendly to him. 

I tried talking to his friend Tyrone about it. I asked if he was playing games or is still into me. He said ""Get over yourself. He falls in love with a different girl every 2 weeks, once he starts avoiding someone, that's it. I think it's because of the party thing. I dunno."". The thing is he actually gets invited to parties now. 

I see him everytime since and his eyes light up when he sees/ talks to this other girl like he did with me and she's taller/ way prettier than me. I dunno what to do about it. I asked his friend if he's seeing anyone. He said ""You and a dozen other women that knocked him back have asked that but yeah I think he's seeing that girl."".

I know people are going to say something like “no one is truly ugly” but if so many people have said this to me, it has to be true, if you truly doubt I’m ugly I can send you a PM showing how hideous I am. When I was going through school the teasing and bullying was a constant. I moved around between schools multiple times and it never stopped.

I’ve never been successful with girls for the reasons listed above. I’ve tried so hard to take care of myself but it just seems like nothing I can do can make me less ugly. I got less fat which I guess is good. I work out a lot and I’m getting into pretty good shape but I’m still fat. I see the same person I was 3 years ago when I look in the mirror.

As much as I’m trying to fix me being fat, I can’t fix me being ugly. In only like 5’10, I’m black and dark skinned in a predominantly white area, I have just fucked up facial features. I hate seeing myself in most pictures or mirrors. I have maybe 5 that I use for all of my dating sites but even with the pictures that look the best, I’m still ugly and undesirable.

43,nd3j7a,1621098469,Does anyone else think women are just as superficial about choosing partners as men?,"I have two male friends who are straight up movie-star level attractive who are about 5'7 and 5'9 respectively (one always gets that they look like Daniel Radcliffe, the other Hugh Grant) and both deal with some anxiety/shyness. And yet since breaking up with their girlfriends a few years ago, both have hardly ever had a date, let alone had much sex. Despite being extremely (conventionally) attractive, funny, incredibly smart, with bright career prospects, they hardly have had any luck with girls. Whereas all my freinds who are tall, with that conventional masculine, aloof confidence, even if they're way less handsome, are dating happily and have no trouble in this area. 

Based on my experience and seeing others, it seems the only thing women care about is that a guy is tall and confident. It doesn't matter if you're creative, funny, a nice person, or even if you're quite good looking (if you don't happen to have the height/confidence). Women constantly complain they can't find a boyfriend who meets their criteria, but only 15% of men are over 6 feet and many of them are total dickheads whereas  my attractive, lovely, interesting friends can barely get a date. Of course, those men are going to ghost them and keep their options open when 90% of the interest goes to these 15% of guys. I realize men are extremely superficial in their criteria as well and are obsessed with looks and curves to the point of obsession, but I feel like only men can crap about it. 

It really feels hard to see the point of dating as a man in your '20s if you don't fit into this small box of people.

So I’m a virgin and have always had bad self confidence. I was so nervous going into it. 

So last night I met up with this girl who i find attractive and we knew we were gonna have sex. We were making out and shit and I was hard. Now soon as she took my pants off I went pretty much soft. After me eating her out and her trying everything I literally couldn’t get hard at all. I feel like shit now and I’ve been thinking about it 24/7 since yesterday.

51,nd3zvv,1621099743,Dating disappointments make me just wanna withdraw again,"I (31F) re-joined the dating game 2 months ago after not dating anyone for 6 years. I've met this one guy who seemed so nice and with whom I felt at least some chemistry. We've been seeing each other for about 2 months now. It was a little scary to start something new, but everything felt so natural that I even slept with him pretty soon (3rd date).

I have c-ptsd due to long domestic abuse I endured during childhood, so even though I go to therapy and it has helped a lot, it's been hard trying to let someone a little closer or try to trust them even a little bit. But I tried to work towards it and my therapist was so excited about this new guy and seemed to think he would be a great guy and worth trying to trust him. But it's a lot of work for me, since I get stressed when being physically or emotionally close to people and my emotions just get blocked automatically and it's just like a void.

We met again yesterday with this guy and at one point he asked how the dating game had been for me with other guys and I said that actually I'm not really seeing other guys anymore, because I didn't feel like it. Then came the speech. He said said that it's nice that we can just hang together and not take things too seriously, and that he would be ok with me seeing other guys because he's still talking to some other girls too. He said he wanted to make it clear to me so that I won't be expecting anything from him, because he can't promise anything, but he doesn't want me to feel used. We agreed that since I have made it clear and made it clear to him again that I don't want FWB type of thing, we should steer clear of too much non-platonic closeness, unless at some point we would feel there were some feelings developing.

This conversation didn't stop him from repeatedly trying to get things going and suggesting sex later the same night. I agreed eventually in the morning, because I guess I just wanted to feel some physical closeness in exchange from feeling so emotionally detached.

But after, I started feeling a little unwell. I had drank the last night so it is possible I just had a really bad hangover. It just came from nowhere after we had finished and I just tried to lay still and not move so that I wouldn't need to throw up. He kept cuddling me and all the touch and the warmth from his body made me feel even more sick. I ended up throwing up multiple times and I felt just horrible. He was trying to help and kept asking if I'm ok and kept bringing me water and offered to go to the store for me to get something if I wanted. I just wanted to be alone because to be unwell when someone else is around just stresses me out like hell because when I feel bad, I just feel the need to withdraw and do my own thing to manage (usually dissociating). So then I just asked him to go and he did.

I do think it's possible I felt so sick because I was upset. It's happened before that when I get upset and the feelings are blocked, I just throw up. I guess I feel disappointed that even though this guy seems like a good person, he doesn't have feelings for me, except sexual feelings I guess, and I just feel so empty. It was such a big thing for me to start trying to date again and now I just feel like i don't want to try that ever again with anybody. The fact that when I was feeling unwell, there was nothing I wanted more than be alone, made me think that I couldn't be in a relationship anyways. 

I just want to withdraw back to my own head, where it's not so hard. Or at least it's hard in a familiar way. I'm so disappointed in both this guy and myself.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nd3zvv/dating_disappointments_make_me_just_wanna/

58,nd4un2,1621102127,I’m pregnant with a guy that doesn’t want to know. What would you do?,"I (F27) started dating a guy (M31) a few months ago. We had the exclusive chat really early on and got on like a house on fire. 

After a few weeks went by, I started to realise that he’d lied about little things, I.e his job title, where his hometown was, exaggerating his career success, country of birth etc. I found out through a LinkedIn suggestion but didn’t confront him. 

One weekend he had an ‘emergency’ and told me that his dad had a heart attack and bailed mid date. 

He told me that he was out of town taking care of his sick father. I drove past his house (it’s an apartment block on a main road on my way home from work) and saw his car outside. I confronted him and asked whether he was in town, he admitted he was and said that he was back temporarily. 

I ignored him for a few days and messaged him later in the week asking if everything he’d told me had been lies. He said he didn’t know what I was talking about but broke it off because I ignored him for days and blocked me. 

Two weeks later I found out I was pregnant. We’d been careful and I was on BC. It was a horrible shock and I cried for days straight. I messaged him and told him that I thought he had a right to know and that I hadn’t made my decision yet. Radio silence. Nothing for over 24 hours. 

My question is, if I decide to keep this baby do I tell him? I was under the impression that I was doing ‘the right thing’ in telling him, but perhaps not?

We have good full-time jobs, and live about 90mins away from each other in TX. We text back and forth daily and she's very responsive. On our date she was fun, flirty and it got physical. After our 3rd date I felt like she became a bit quiet and asked her out again and she said she can't this weekend because she's is busy with work. We haven't talked on the phone (like a call) or met in 3 weeks, although she texts me multiple times daily and shows that she cares. I finally asked her what's up she hasn't been available and if she isn't interested I get it... and she said ofcourse she is interested in me and she is very sorry she is working really long hours these days and feels guilty and will put in more effort.

87,nd8jrn,1621112931,It’s been a pretty frustrating and hopeful week.,"I (23M) am not gonna go into too much detail. Matched with 3 girls earlier this week on Dating site. Most successful week I’ve ever had really. 

One gave me a soft rejection when I asked her out today. I have a feeling I asked her out too soon.

Another I had arrangements to meet on Thursday for dinner. Come Wednesday she has to cancel because somethings come up. No idea if she’ll ever let me know when she’s free, but we’re still talking at least so haven’t lost all hope I guess.

Last one started out good 2 days ago. She hasn’t texted anything lately except one yesterday saying she’s busy at her last day at work. And of course my brain is jumping to conclusions assuming she’s lost interested cause I texted back “last day where?” Instead of “sorry we can talk later when you’re not busy”.

Anyways, I’m probably just gonna sulk a bit for today; Maybe read my book. Try to stay positive moving forward.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nd8jrn/its_been_a_pretty_frustrating_and_hopeful_week/
88,nd8l03,1621113031,Don’t hide who you are.,"People have gotten way too comfortable with angles/filters/makeup changing and hiding who they really are. I started looking for dates and got a few dating apps this week. So far the matches were ok and I’ve had 4-5 virtual dates. 

Maybe I’m just bad at being able to tell, or this is the norm and I just haven’t experienced this like everyone else. Most of them clearly were not the people in their profile. The others didn’t work for other reasons and that’s ok. I think the ones that had a different face or had gained weight could have maybe worked for something less serious. now that I feel lied to I see no point in talking with them. 

Attraction is not only about your body type. You can be forward, funny, and honest and I probably would have still talked to the real version of them. Someone that’s out of my weight preferences that has a picture of them working out or saying they eat well and are working on themselves is great and shows you are working on yourself. Accept and show who you are. If you don’t like something about yourself, try and change what you can and be content with the things you can’t be.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nd8l03/dont_hide_who_you_are/
89,nd8lnw,1621113088,Just thought I'd share my own (F) opinion on male virgins,"I've seen some people write about how it is bad, shameful to be a virgin in your mid-to-late 20s. Some people even suggested paying for the experience to get it out of the way. Personally, I think being a male virgin is a huge plus, and I at least know my friend circle would agree. I wouldn't want to be with someone who could potentially pass on diseases, particularly something incurable or could lead to cancer. I have maintained my own virginity this far, so I'd like to be with someone who understands that it is important to value your and your future partner's health.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nd8lnw/just_thought_id_share_my_own_f_opinion_on_male/

91,nd8sh0,1621113637,Any good tips on dying single and alone?,"Hey, just curious if anyone here has any good tips for planning to die single and alone? 

It's hard to imagine that I'll ever meet anyone if my choices are continuing to use dating apps where I do get matches, but any quality match I get always happens to be the people who don't reply, show little interest through one word replies, or they drop off conversation after a day or two. Meeting people in real life would be cool if it weren't for the fact I'm in my late 30s and everyone I meet nowadays is married or not single.

Is there by chance a particular space reserved like a commune where all relatively attractive, fit people with decent jobs and interests can go to live in peace, away from the world of coupling and gratuitous hookups that never seem to have a place for them so they can just be and fade away into oblivion peacefully?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nd8sh0/any_good_tips_on_dying_single_and_alone/
92,nd8uiy,1621113798,Breakup?,"So my girlfriend and I have been dating for a bit over two years now. For the past few months I haven’t felt any sort of romantic feelings towards her. I don’t enjoy texting her a lot, I don’t talk about her, when we hang out we don’t talk much, and I’ve been feeling super distant. I’ve thought of the idea of breaking up for a super long time, almost a year and a half. I’ve stayed in the relationship due to guilt. I’ve tried to break up with her multiple times in person but I have super bad anxiety so I had an anxiety attack beforehand each time and couldn’t do it. We have prom coming up in less than a week so maybe a week after prom I was just going to end it over text. Is this okay to do? I don’t want to be cold and break up with her in this disrespectful way, but I know if I try to do it in person or even over a call I will for sure get anxiety and the right words wouldn’t even come out.

99,nd9jz5,1621115940,Advice for huys,"Hey, I’m a gal. I see on here guys who try both approaching women IRL and using online apps routinely say the IRL method works better 

A guy just approached me IRL and said I look lovely and had a chat and then he asked if we could meet sometime and took my number. 

Now, I can tell you for a fact if this guy had appeared on my dating apps I probably wouldn’t even have swiped right, I swipe right probably 1 in 35 and take less than half a second to swipe left. Left left left left, soo fast. 

But someone approaches you IRL, now they have REALLY stood out. They’ve shown they’re polite (the compliment), confident (which is probably the most attractive thing in a lot of contexts) and made an impact on you which is incomparable to seeing a pic on a dating app for 1/4 of a second. 

As I said this guy wasn’t especially attractive at all and I prob would’ve swiped left but now I’m excited to meet him as he impressed me and that’s made me feel glowy 

So it’s no mystery to me that guys of all levels of attractiveness on here state that going for the (perhaps rare these days) IRL approach have so much more success
