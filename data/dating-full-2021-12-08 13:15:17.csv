So Iv been speaking to a girl for about 2-3 on and off(not consistent). We met up and just went out for a long drive 3 hours together I reckon we both hit it of really well. Intentions where made clear when she asked me what I was looking for… I’m getting to know someone for the possibility of something long term. As soon as I got home I received a thank text telling me that she really enjoyed her self after a very long time I was busy for about 30 mins so don’t open or respond straight away. then she called so follow basically a follow up call telling the same thing and also apologise (insecure I guess) if she’d don’t anything to offend or put me off and asking me as to what I thought of her. This call must have lasted another nearly 2 hours. In my opinion clearly sparks where flying.

Anyway I leave it a day and call her on her mobile which she doesn’t take and I hang up just before it went to voice Mail i dint follow with a text to obviously not be needy. And understand people are busy I think nothing of it and go to sleep. I wait a day and don’t hear anything from her. Iv not contacted her again as I don’t chase but I just am completely baffled and confused.

She still sends me good day and good nigth messages in snapchat every morning and night, but it just feel very unpersonal.

 A few days ago she sent a picture of herself all of a sudden, and she has told me she really like me one time. I feel like it's very mixed signals she are sending and I can't decode them. She also wrote a long apology too me recently and said she had been very busy lately, and hadn't though about me. I thought fair enough but too busy to even communicate at all?  

I'm very reluctant about stopping with her, I really haven't been good in this dating game and it felt nice for at change to have a great time with a girl. 

I'm not really sure at all, I want to keep the ""Window open"" if you know what I mean, but i'm just tired of not getting anything back. I'm not bitter about it, but just confused and disappointed about it, I thought this time it would really work out.

The first time Sam and I met was over at his place. We cooked, danced, talked, laughed, and ended up hooking up. He’s an attractive guy and I’m cool with casual hookups so it was okay with me if nothing came of this. The next few times we met up it was as great as the first time. He’s been a real gentleman and always seems concerned for how I’m feeling with him.

We’ve met up 4/5 times now and when we’re together we seem to hit it off well. I’ve been on a lot of dates this year and I’ve only hit it off with two guys since that time (though the other guy did a 180 and decided he wasn’t ready for getting into anything, which is okay).

Thing is, Sam isn’t big on talking over the internet. I don’t think he’s this way just with me, it seems he does this with everyone. He describes himself as a ‘lone wolf’, which I’m the opposite of. He told me his best friend is a roommate he had a couple years ago and when I asked when they last spoke, he said it’s been a couple of months. He seems to mostly socialize with his circle at work (casually pointing out a couple times that a coworker is in love with him, wants to hook up and thinks his ass is cute. He’s brought up hookups he’s had as well, mostly during the first few times we met). I’ve offered to talk over the phone, but he told me he’d rather talk when we see each other.

Now the last time we met I went over to his to get something we agreed I’d leave at his before a trip I went on. This time I didn’t stay the night and we didn’t have sex because he said he felt he was slipping back into old habits. By this he meant having sex to fill a hole, not because of some connection. See, he broke up with an on and off girlfriend of 4 years this summer, who things got toxic with, so he has some shit he has to work through. The first times we hooked up though he flat out told me he was surprised he wanted me to stay. He said he hadn’t felt what he felt with me with his last hookups (on one hookup with somebody his ex texted him and he told the girl to leave; with me the same thing happened but he ignored her message), and said he felt casual sex wasn’t something he wanted in his life anymore. So we didn’t hook up and just had a good time. After I left he messaged me right away and told me it was nice being together without the sex and he’d like to explore that more. We have plans to meet at the end of December.

Now to sum it up. I like this guy. I’m really interested in seeing where things go with him since he’s unlike any guy I’ve met before. BUT he just had a big breakup and while I’m understanding of this and am not going to rush him into anything, I fear that I’m chasing something unattainable. While he seems genuinely interested, he’s told me that the only woman who has power over him in his life is his ex. At this point we aren't exclusive or anything.

Humans are very complex creatures and not all of them are very open with their emotions. 

Actually, I would say very few people are. Like I get it, some people meet others who are certain of their feelings and are confident enough to share it with them. That's awesome, good for you. But most of the time, before confessing or showing how they truly feel, people test the field to see if the other person responds and it's totally normal.

And I can sense there will be people coming in here with the whole stories on how they are introvert but in spite of this, they have succeeded in asking someone out, so obviously if they could, everyone can. *eyeroll*

There are people who suffer from extreme anxiety, who maybe think they don't have any chance with that person, yada,yada. I am the kind of person of who you could never tell when I like someone because I am the same with everyone. And unless you ask me directly, I won't tell. 

So stop spreading this as the gospel truth. 
And just a warning, I'm not saying I encourage people to wait for others, or to keep questioning the intentions of others. Just be open and honest with yourself and with the other person. 

Do what you can do when it comes to your own person. The other stuff, like analyzing the other person's feelings and thoughts, you need to drop it because it's not in the realm of your control. 

Because no matter how hard you try, you cannot read minds.

I have a huge social circle, tons of friends, both guys and girls, so I have no issues being sociable. I love too and am great at meeting new people.

I actually pity myself for entering relationships that arent really a relationship. I was afraid to be lonely, so I did everything that they wanted, I was afraid that they’ll leave me so I adjusted and gave everything untill all I felt was emptiness. Despite of my efforts to make them stay, and love me. They leave me because I was never enough, and I am not worthy to love. There are times they will just stop texting me, or will reprimand me for texting them so much. Times when they told me I was boring, or I gained weight which made my body not flattering in their eyes. 

I remember going to dates, I remember chatting a person that made me smile every night. I remember dropping, “I love you’s” in the hope of having solidity and stability. Only for dates to end up being left alone in the abyss, or chats to end up with lousy breathing due to the short time past time that I agreed to do, to read the words, “You’re beautiful and I Love You.” Back at those times, I thought it was real, I thought that if I just did great during sex, or be understanding and never cross the border they didnt want me to cross. I’ll experience being loved sincerely.

But no, they never saw me as a girlfriend, or even as someone they value. I realized that its just me trying to make myself believe that we have can turn into something solid. Back then I thought that if I just made myself sexy, pretty, be great and be understanding, then I can find what Im looking for. 

I was wrong, ever since I was highschool no one saw me as someone worth loving. No matter how hard I saw kindness, and adjust to their ideals. It was never and not enough. And now, years have passed and I am turning 26 in just 18 minutes from now. In all those years no one really dared to love me. No one made an effort to pick me up at school or work, they all see me as someone who leaves too far for them to make an effort. But they see me as someone worth making time if they will get the desired sex they want.

No one even tried to give me a piece on chocolate on valentines or tell me that I am beautiful as a compliment. I realized that all this time, I am lonely, drowning myself with the illusion of being loved.

At 26, I am still at this abyss, trying to get up, trying to supply myself with love to survive. But as I saw how others find the love I wanted, I would die in agony asking myself, “why cant I find that?” Another year will come, another valentines will come, and other occasions will pass by.

I will continue my 26th year falling into this abyss. I will no longer try to survive.

I don’t normally get big pimples on my forehead anymore but it started last week I noticed a full blown out break out happening.

So I finally got irritated going into a second week and decided to take matters into my own fingers. So I grabbed a pimple tool and just pressed down really hard to get everything out.
However this was the dumbest thing I could have done because barely anything came out and it left a super dark mark that scabbed over. Which I picked that.
And as of my luck could get any worse the a guy who I’ve been head over heels for (who had previously ghosted me for 2 months) called me up to apologize and make it up to me by taking me on a date. I agreed because we had said that Sunday would be the day (and it would give me time to figure something out) but then yesterday he wanted to see me and I said I was busy because there’s no way I could cover the mess on my forehead. Looks like a mini tiny horn. But he is insistent on seeing me so he made plans for today. 
I’m freaking out. The first time I see this guy and I don’t want to look bad, I want to feel confident. But instead of just worrying about just date nerves I’ve been trying on ugly hats to cover it up and looking up videos on how to cover up an upset scaring pimple.

He’s in many of my classes (which are online) and we’ve met outside of school a couple of times. Guys, he’s everything I want in a man—charming, handsome, smart, and sophisticated. Unfortunately, I’m leaving in two weeks and in all likelihood, we’re never going to see each other again. Now, I’ve come to reconcile myself with that. It’s fine. But if nothing else happens, I think a hookup would be a great way to have some fun, before I leave the country.

He’s in a Fwb situation with atleast two other girls (which I don’t care about) so I know that he’s atleast open to the prospect. But we’re not close enough to where I feel comfortably calling us FWBs and I don’t know how to go about suggesting anything more than friendship. 

There’s also the subject of looks. I like myself, but I definitely fit the role of the confident, but funny fat American.

Back before COVID (and a bit during, oops) I was decent at hooking up, but haven't done that for about a year. I wasn't in a good place for dating, was just too busy, and really only had the time or care for random sex occasionally. It was fun, definitely, but I wanted so much more than just sex.

Fast forward to today, I've been going on a few dates with this girl that I like a lot. She's fun, laughs at my jokes, but is similarly introverted to me and independent, which is a big deal for me in a relationship (weirdly). However, she's poly and already has a partner. At first I was okay with that, she was up front and forward about it. She's very open about it and made sure I was comfortable with it before the first date ever happened.

I'm worried I'm not accurately setting my boundaries and that my behavior isn't coming off as I intend. I like her a lot, I really do, but I have no intention of constructing a relationship with someone who is already in one. I have no problems with polygamous or polyamorous relationships, but for myself I would definitely prefer something closer to polyfidelity.

Obvious the best advice is ""Just tell her you have no intentions of doing anything but fuck her"", but assuming I'm either not going to do that or already plan to, what other advice is there?

He claims that the only reason he did those things was because he is insecure and needed validation that I wasn’t giving him (tbh I was not being a very loving girlfriend). He said he will do whatever it takes to make it right, up to and including going to couples counseling and putting an “accountability app” on his phone. He swears he only wants me and will never again do anything to compromise what we have. 
 
The difficult thing about this situation is that he really seems to have a problem with severe insecurities. He isn’t just being defensive and trying to convince me that what he did wasn’t a big deal. He knows it was a very big deal and that it broke my heart.

Would you ever be able to believe them again?

I know beauty is subjective and it’s absolutely not the case to everyone because people that are not into me are not making a point to tell me how they perceive me. 

I have a high IQ and scarily quick recall but slower processing speed with new people and new interactions. As I get to know someone I can read them like a book, but right off the bat it takes me a couple beats more than someone else. 

I tend to be quiet and observant in groups unless we are being silly, riffing, cracking jokes, telling vulnerable stories, or getting into deep talks. The middle ground of “what kind of car do you drive” and “any vacations coming up?” I will give one word answers because I just don’t really care about those things and I accept this about myself whether or not that is considered rude. 

I can also be quite literal so if someone says always or never I tend to jump to believe they truly mean always or never for real. Sarcasm, done well (think Mike Meyers in So I Married an Axe Murderer), does make me laugh, but some kinds of sarcasm I do not pick up on at all and I’ll ask “oh really??” 

I feel deeply and intensely and feel no qualms about shedding a tear if I am moved, but I’m even quicker to laugh. People have told me “you’re very intense” or “your eyes make me nervous” because I hyper focus to a fault, and when someone is talking to me I do listen very closely and watch intently, with love and acceptance. I am not judgmental to a fault, sometimes to the point of accepting the wrong person but I am working on that in therapy, with listening to my gut. 

I need good amounts of alone time to get lost in thought, pursue my hobbies and passions and recharge my battery, but want high intensity interval intimacy with my partner where the time we spend is good quality. 

I know how to care for my sensory needs now so I don’t let myself get to the point of overwhelm, but super loud hectic places are draining because my brain doesn’t tune anything out. I may need a breather from time to time.

Men on dates have been surprised at how blunt, straightforward, direct, and honest I am, even when I am making a point to tone it down and not be too revealing, but with me, what you see is what you get. Ask me anything and I will tell the absolute truth and I don’t mince words.

My affect can be stoic and on a phonecall with a guy I’m interested in recently when I said “Hi.” He was surprised at how serious I sounded. I speak in a serious maybe even masculine tone as opposed to maybe what women are normally doing? I’m not too sure, but for me, I am to the point and end my sentences with a period, period.

I tend to take my interests to the level of obsession, for now it is health and fitness, acting, comedy, and spirituality. I get consumed with my interests and hyper focus on the tiniest of details that most people miss. My body is an ongoing project for me, and I am fine tuning it with exercise because I enjoy it and love to see the results.

Your mom may feel slighted if she expects me to “kiss her ass” or do small talk. I realized that’s a girl thing maybe, but I would rather truly get to know her, her past, her role as a mother, what makes her tick, her method of loving you and your other parent, what she modeled for you. Do I seem like a Vulcan here?

I ask a lot of questions because I want to deeply understand before I go onto the next and context can go over my head. I don’t want to interrogate just fully grasp. I am learning to pick my battles in this regard.

I used to be quite tactless in my 20s but mentalization therapy helped with my cognitive empathy skills and this is an ongoing process, I welcome feedback from trusted sources.

There’s more but this is probably what the first three months of dating would show.

I am obviously mostly interested to hear from people who are not making sweeping judgments about autistic people based on pre conceived notions. Everyone is unique autistic or not. I am a joyful optimistic person happiest when dancing, singing, riffing, or cuddling. My sex drive is off the charts and I am curious and loving. Complex problem solving is easy to me, I can get caught up in the simple things.

I am 36, but open to younger or older, age is just a number and most people are shocked to find out I am not in my late 20s. 

Pics can be found in my history or attached Instagram if anyone is curious on my that. My insta may be deceiving because I am actually extremely down to earth - realizing looks/style/brand is supposed to speak volumes on someone’s personality, but I just love the sexy blonde babe look while not being superficial at all. Vanity is one tiny spoke on my wheel, not my entire existence. I am considering toning it down to “show” who I really am but when I was little I thought Pam Anderson on Tool Time (Home Improvement) was goals.

We were firstly in a relationship about 6 years ago, we were together for around 8 months and things were going well until I found out she was engaged. One of my friends found out and when I confronted her she denied it but I found out it was true after seeing him on her social media so I deleted her off everything even though she tried messaging me just before her wedding. She eventually ended up getting divorced a year in to her marriage, that was around 4 years ago. 

Around last year we got back in touch and we got back together as she seemed to have changed a lot, but a while in to the relationship she revealed that she did have quite a few boyfriends before then and that she had slept with someone. I was understanding and things seemed to be going fine after and we even planned for marriage, but then I noticed how much of a rush she was in to get married and how she said she always misses me. 

But lately we have argued a lot and she has really wound me up to the point where I didn't want to speak to her, she knew I wanted my space but to get my attention she ended up blocking me off everything. When I asked why she blocked me she said she didn't want me to have access to her if I can't commit to her, even though she has a lot of random guys on there! She eventually unblocked me. My own family wasn't happy about my relationship as my mother wasn't keen on her but I eventually persuaded her to accept (I realise now how stupid I was). 

A few months later, I noticed her being open again about other guys but instead of saying anything I stayed quiet. Because there was a guy that she used to talk to that got in touch with her, he was actually a married man so I don't know why he was reaching out to her but what bothered me the most was that she would complain about him getting in touch but she never blocked him to stop him from getting in touch with her, it felt as though she liked the attention. 

When she asked why I was quiet, she insisted that I can talk to her about anything so I told her that I wasn't happy with how open she is with other guys, she then went on to say how she didn't want to be with someone that is insecure as her ex husband was the same. I was quite annoyed at this point as she has said herself in the past that she is insecure too and she always had mood swings and emotional issues due to her endometriosis which I was always understanding of, it hurt that she couldn't be understanding of my mental health. 

So then she went on to complain about me not committing to her, at this point I had enough of it and said that if she wants to end it she should do it now so she went ahead and blocked me off social media. She didn't block my number but now I have blocked hers so she can't get in touch with me.

Hi all,

I've been seeing a guy for 2 months now after a two year dating break and it's been great. I feel we're very aligned with a lot of values, have a lot of chemistry humor wise, sexually and emotionally and have a lot of shared interests. I've been enjoying getting know him and spending time with him a lot and I'm in just one of those stages where I just know I'm gonna really fall for someone.

On our first date he mentioned that before the pandemic he had wanted to move to from the UK to Australia but those plans had been cancelled and I mentioned that I had wanted to move to France and those plans had been cancelled, but neither said anything about any renewal of those plans now after travelling has opened up again.

A couple of days ago he told me that he's started to consider his move to Australia again probably to happen in August and to come back after a year. At the start of our dating I did say that my intention for dating is to ultimately to find a relationship and at the time he expressed that given the right person he's also on the same page with that so now the return of his itch to move abroad has got me feeling uneasy.

Do I continue to date him even though I know he's moving soon to save myself heartbreak later? We are meant to have a proper chat about this new development on the weekend after some time for us to think since we haven't discussed it in depth yet and I'm unsure how to proceed.

I feel as a person who also has aspirations for travelling and living abroad, I don't see his 'itch' as a clash to my personality, it's just that has come up at an awkward early stage of dating. If I was dating someone for 2 years and they wanted to move Australia I would probably go with them without too much worry, which makes this whole situation so difficult, I think he's a great match (as much as you can tell in 2 months) and I see myself as more likeminded with someone with his aspirations rather than someone looking to settle down somewhere permanently in their 20s. It feels so difficult to try and cut him off this early when even his move to Australia makes him even more attractive in my mind.

But obviously it's very early to make a decision like this with someone or to know where you'll be at the time, I could decide to continue and we could break up before even getting to August, but is it crazy to ask whether in general he'd be ever open to moving with a partner at the time given things were going well between us? Not asking for him to give me a concrete answer but more asking if he'd ever do it and so at the time we could decide? because if his answer is a solid no and that he'd always want to do it single no matter what or that he wouldn't ever consider moving with someone he'd been dating for 10 months then maybe getting more emotionally invested isn't great for me and I should break it off now, since I am dating and putting my emotions on the line to potentially be in a committed relationship.

I'd like to emphasis that although me considering a possibility of moving abroad with him is definitely prompted by my interest in him, but I also believe it aligns with some of my own life goals, so in a way I wonder whether this is one of those random life opportunities that has popped up that would make the idea of moving to the other side of the world less daunting and less lonely for starting out.

As a follow up to this, am I crazy for even considering potentially given things going well, moving abroad with someone I would only have known for 10 months? is this just one of those things that even though is really good right now and technically doesn't really have a deal breaking flaw, I should just let go?

The worst case of this conversation on the weekend is that we break up so might ask well as the awkward and very forward question of whether he'd ever consider moving with me given it was going well at the time? I'm just really dreading the disappointment that would come from this worst case, given I just see so much potential, it just feels so premature to cut it off now without considering this probably quite idealistic future...

He would pick his nose in front of me, his health ~down there~ was not the best, his house was pretty gross (but he was working on it) just like he was supposed to be working on not picking his nose, and other things, etc. *

I (18F) met this guy (20M) on bumble and we’ve been getting to know each other really well. I think he’s really into me. I’m still unsure if I feel the same way cause even though he’s nice and sweet to me, his social background kind of “scares” me?

I grew up really sheltered in a very strict and conservative household. My parents are both physicians and I’d say we’re living comfortably. Basically, I have really high standards when it comes to almost everything. (It’s also an INFJ thing) I’m an overachiever, I make sure to study well yada yada. 

Anyways, the nice guy didn’t really grow up with the same “comfort” as me. His dad died when he was younger and now only his mom works. He studies in a university that I didn’t know about until I googled it and is a psych irregular student. 

I had to mention the last sentence because he kind of tricked me at first. He didn’t really say he was from that school and told me he was going to go to this medical school but was still unsure. I told him about my goals in life on how I’m really the go big or go home type of person. I plan on getting Latin honors once I graduate from my pre-med course and attend this prestigious medical school in the future. 

I think it inspired him to do better and so he’s enrolled in the middle of the year to finish his incomplete requirements and is planning on finishing a year of school even in summer to catch up with his batchmates.

He even told me that he told his mom about his medical school plan and his mom was supportive of him. He’s also changed his mind and started aiming for the same medical school I’m going for. (He’s planning on borrowing money from his Aunt for the tuition cause his mom can’t afford it). I’m really supportive of him and I hope he gets to accomplish everything he’s planned on finishing. 

However, I’m kinda scared that if in the future we started dating, my friends and family will judge him. The people around me are really accomplished and are very prideful. They know how very picky I am with things and I think dating the guy will shock them. I don’t think anyone will approve of him until he becomes a licensed doctor which is like 6-8+ years (?) from now.

Should I continue talking to him or cut him off because I really enjoy our conversations but his background kind of “scares” me. 

Sorry if I sound really mean, I’m just really unsure of dating stuff like this especially when you’re surrounded by many accomplished and well known people and relatives.

So this is going to be long post and I am thankful for every one of you who will read it. Also I am sorry about my English, its not my first language.

So this is a story about me and my first love. We met when I was 13 years old, and he was 14. We were best friends for a year and a half. He was my first kiss. He kissed me on my 14th birthday and I was so happy. I was in love with him since the first day I saw him. But he was in love with my best friend (that's how we met). Around my birthday he was with some girl and he was really in love with her, but that didn't last. Few days after my birthday he told me that he lost his virginity. We had a few super romantic moments after that and I couldn't do it so i stopped communication with him. 8 years later I saw him in the nightclub and we got into contact again. He moved to my city just when the first lockdown started. We started hanging out everyday. I met him with all of my friends etc. Also he was a dealer. In april I found out a huge secret about him. He was SA by his father and his uncles for all of his chiledhood. That lasted until he was 14 years old. That was the last time. He lived with his uncle and when he told him that he knows what they did, he kicked him out. I didn't want him to sleep on the streets so I gave him all the money I had (about 400€) so he could rent a place. In summer 2020 we slept together. He was my first everything. I never done anything with boys except kissing. All along he had a physical relationship with some girl from tinder. And everytime something happend between us ( he initiated every time), the next morning he would told me it was a huge mistake and that we shouldn't do that. He would left and come back few hours later and we would do it all over again. He had some big issues with the police because of his dealing so I gave him money for food and food for his cats for 2 months. I also gave him money for dates and condoms with that tinder girl. Than he left to the police and reported his father and police sent him to the safe house. He told me he was in love with this tinder girl (we were sleeping together all of this time) and I encourage him. She didn't want anything to do with him because of his past. Also I was in love with him all along but didn't wanna say anything since it was obvious that he didn't care about me. So 3 months later he asked me to be his girlfriend and I was over the moon. We didn't have any problems but that was the problem. I paid for everything since he couldn't work. He was going on therapy and everything. I paid for his phone, i bought him a new phone, his clothes, food, our dates etc. We needed to rent AirBnb so we could have some alone time (you know) since we couldn't hang at my place bc of my parents and he was in the safe house. He refused to touch me or kiss me in the public (told me that he was uncomfortable since other people were looking). We saw each other once a week and he was always on his phone, 'he had nothing to talk about'. Although I told him my love language was physical touch he couldn't be botherd. I remember how I begged him for 15 minutes just for one kiss. For his birthday I went all out. I wanted him to feel special since it was such a shitty year for him. It was a nice day. I went to holiday trip with my friends for a month. It was August and I was there on my bithday. He forgot about it and when I asked him did he forget, he just told me that he couldn't write sth so beautiful as I did to him so he wouldn't even try. When I got back we saw each other (after a month) and he didn't touch me/hug me/kiss me for a whole day we were together. He started working and I told him that I don't want anything material for my birthday, just 11 hugs and 11 kisses (since it was my 22 birthday). Next morning I told him that I was sad that he didn't touch me the day before and he left me. Told me that he never loved me and that I needed 120% attention. I was heartbroken. I still am. I cried for 120 days straight. Couldn't belive it. Today I found out he went on a date with my ex best friend. She is a trans girl (she started taking hormones few months ago). I can't breathe. Also he promised me to give me back all of the money (around  900€). And the deal was that he would send me some money every month. He never did. I reached out to him and he send me 30€ and thats it. That was in October. 
If you have some advice how to make peace with this I would be so thankfull. I know I was naive idiot. I know. But I can't not help someone in need. Please if you have some advice I would be thankfull.

I've been on a date recently with a woman, she blocked me the day we were having our second date. I tried to reach her out multiple times without success and ended up sending her 2 messages and one voicemail. Those messages were clingy af but whatever.

I move on, date other girls and notice that she is, for whatever reason, blocking and unblocking my number multiple times. The 2 messages I've sent her went delivered on different days. When someone blocks your number, your message is not supposed to be delivered (that's the point of blocking someone's number).

Now, even though I felt bad for my clingy behavior, I have the feeling that I've dodged a bullet. I don't want to play stupid games and my reaction is just to move on after this.  

But I don't know why, I still feel bad about this situation. Not about what I've done but about what she is currently doing.

I have this situation going on, which I never thought I'd post about online, but at this point it has become so annoying and tormenting I cannot help but share and ask for some advice. Also, I apologise if my English is bad, its not my first language.

2 years ago I met this guy in campus. After that, for the next year and a half we had just been saying ""hi"", when we saw eachother in the hallways, but never really held a conversation. That recently changed though - two times he invited me to short walks around the campus during breaks, he came to ask me random stuff sometimes, and we've chatted online a bit. I've had a crush on him for an year already, and just when things began to look good these past few months, I feel as though I've either messed everything up, or he has lost feeling OR in the best case scenario - he has feelings for me too, but is shy/angry at me and doesn't want to do anything about them, but forget them ( kinda like me at this point :'] ). This is exactly what I'd like to ask advice for - Is there a chance he might like me, and what should I do? Here are some stuff that have happened (in order):

- We started greeting eachother
- We started having small talk when we saw eachother in a shop or something
- He gave me this bottlecap pin he made
- He invited me twice to walk around the campus 
- We texted a couple of times, found out we had a lot of mutual interests 
- I invited him to a walk 
~ then there was lockdown for 2 months in which ~
- We texted a bit (I always initiated, he never texted first)
- He suggested we play videogames once, but I was really busy and sadly had no time, so I rejected him 
- We saw eachother once in public, and he once again suggested to play, to which I agreed, but we never texted when we got home to start playing. I didn't see him online anywhere that night, so I didn't text him, because I thought he was busy 
~ end of lockdown ~
- We've been ignoring eachother mutually, I - because am too nervous, and him - well idk 
- I gave him this pin I made, in hopes of initiating a conversation, but I barely even got a thanks (there was a classmate of his around. I was actually talking with her and he came to tell her he had made tee, but stayed with us nonetheless, so I thought there was still hope? Maybe he likes her tho idk)

So this is all for the past 5-6 months :') I'm really lost and I don't know what to do. I really like this person though, he is the first I've liked in such a way, but If I have no chances I should start thinking of ways get over him because this is torture T-T.

I do too.  She also says that she has two very close guy friends that she is physically and emotionally intimate with (they ""snuggle"", clothing on she says) that she maintains are just very close, platonic friends, and that her stated condition or boundary for engaging in a monogamous relationship is that her relationship with them stays completely the same.  My boundary in entering an intimate and romantic monogamous relationship is I want to feel safe, valued, and respected as a partner, and that includes being the only partner that's doing ""boyfriend"" stuff to you.

After observing how she is with them, what she describes as platonic feels very intimate and romantic... to me, it feels like she has a physically and emotionally polyamorous situation going on with these dudes.  They call each other romantic pet names, they talk frequently and spend nights together, and buy each other nice gifts.  She maintains there's no sexual intimacy or attraction, but they are physically intimate and cuddle and sleep together.  She's also just a very sexual person and comfortable with her body, often wearing revealing and sexy outfits.  I love it, but I also feel like that kind of style needs to come with strong boundaries for me to feel comfortable and I'm not really seeing those.  I find myself going crazy trying to wrap my brain around this situation because I don't act the same way with my ""platonic"" friends.

Is this behavior people consider normal now?  I'm not the best socially... I'm sensitive, depressed, and have been in therapy for a while now trying to rebuild self-esteem after my last relationship.  I've always been very guarded and maintain very strong boundaries with friends because I don't want people to get the wrong idea, or get emotionally involved with someone that I fear will abandon me later.  My idea of a monogamous relationship feels either very outdated, or I fear that I'm being gaslighted.  I also know I have really strong avoidant tendencies, and our relationship had moved really, really fast so my brain could just be trying to make mountains out of molehills to create a reason to eject without waiting to see if I really get hurt.

Either way, my lack of trust for the situation makes me think we're not right for each other and I shouldn't keep it going.  Nobody deserves a partner that doubts them.  I'm just trying to get some perspective on what monogamy is considered these days.

And she also brought me to this Thai restaurant. which I later thought was a completely terrible place. I asked all my friends and they all agreed with me. The initial reason I asked her out literally because she was pretty and seemed friendly. And I really liked the idea of asking pretty gals out when you're in college. She later said she wasn't interested in me anymore, I politely asked her why and she said she knew I was in am environment I didn't like, but I was too negative.

I was shocked. But I still said thanks for letting me know back to her and maintained politeness.

But the thing is, I felt really hurt by that. I have literally saved lives these years, and I have been super excited to try everything I can and even go abroad and study.

There's not really anything exciting about me. I work a decent job that pays well for what I do. I'm ok financially.   
I play video games with friends during my free time and I do exercise to not gain weight but I actually hate exercise. I also eat healthy because there was a period of time I gained a lot of weight and a friend scared me by saying that I have higher risk of heart attack if I kept eating junk food, so I basically stopped junk food altogether.   
I shower everyday, I brush my teeth everyday, I try shaving everyday because I prefer a clean shave, not that I can grow anything and I've tried.     
Because of Covid, I don't go out, but I didn't go out before Covid so that doesn't matter.    
If given a choice, I'd probably stay home more than going out, but I do enjoy long strolls as long as there's someone else to walk with me. The last time I went on a stroll was........... a while ago.
