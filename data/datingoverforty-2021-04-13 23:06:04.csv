If so, how did you ask? How did they respond? Was it successful (by your definition of success)? Is there a sub where we can match make each other??

Some background: 39F. Never married, no kids, having a miserable time OLD this go around (been on and off for 5 years, off when I meet someone or need a break, 2 medium-term relationships and several mini ones in that time. Countless first dates)

When I was younger my mom and her friends set me up all the time. From 18-31. Nothing ever turned into a relationship and there were some horror stories, but it was still really nice to be considered and I was grateful for the help. Had one 5-yr relationship in that time where I met him at a friend‚Äôs party.

31-33 was in a serious relationship that ended badly and I needed a long break from dating. When I was ready again, two friends did set me up, but neither went past the first date (one guy only wanted sex, and was aggressive about it, and I think my friend felt horrible when I told her). I was still grateful and told my friends so, but they‚Äôve never done it again. I did ask a couple of coworkers once if they knew anyone, but they said they didn‚Äôt and I was embarrassed I asked. My 75-year old neighbor tried to set me up with her allergist by asking him directly if he was single and he said that‚Äôs inappropriate and that didn‚Äôt go anywhere üòÇ

I live in a big city area, have many good friends and lots of acquaintances of different ages in different careers and social circles, but no one else has ever offered and I don‚Äôt know how to ask. Or if I even should.

I‚Äòm 43M and feel like I‚Äôm pretty objective about my dating value. I‚Äôm good looking and take care of myself - the last person I dated asked if I enjoyed looking at my body in the mirror. Other women have made similar comments. I‚Äôm six-figures, house, no debt, and do well socially. I‚Äôve never had an issue making friends. I know what creepy is and I‚Äôm far from it.

I can‚Äôt seem to find many women playing with a similar hand. At least not single ones. Eventually I get lonely and desperate for intimacy so I lower the bar. I easily get someone at this point, usually having made sacrifices in the age or fitness department, and ‚Äúforce‚Äù myself to date them for 1 or 2 months, thinking I‚Äôll find the inner beauty if I just give it time. I can‚Äôt ever seem to last longer than that as I have trouble maintaining the effort without the physical attraction. So I raise the bar again and the cycle repeats. I hate doing this because in the end someone gets hurt and I feel awful about it. I much prefer being the one who gets broken up with.

She‚Äôs very much my type when it comes to appearance and her texting game is great. Lots of initiation from her end which tbh is rare amongst women I‚Äôve dated. Her children are grown and barely college graduated but mine are still teens just entering HS. So I have been doing every other week dating with her although I‚Äôm about ready to transition to dating when I have my kids (50/50 custody, no baby mama drama). 

But I should have realized when kissing her it just did not feel natural. Like she was very hesitant or maybe didn‚Äôt enjoy it? I‚Äôve always been complimented on my kissing so I‚Äôm not sure. Anyways we had great dates, lots of good conversations, just kissing was subpar and no foreplay type activities. We had a short conversation about sex on our last date where she mentioned it was important in a relationship. I remarked the same and that I feel strongly about it too. I also mentioned that this was the longest I‚Äôd waited to have sex with someone but that I was enjoying our time and didn‚Äôt mind. She seemed taken aback by this and made a comment about ‚Äúwhat kind of women had I been dating‚Äù. I shrugged it off, but it left a weird feeling in my gut. Honestly I usually have sex within the first four dates and also request/require exclusivity for both of us. But with this woman I was fine waiting a little longer.

Well we broke it off today. I sensed she was pulling back based on her not making any time for us to date this weekend and her lack of texting. So I texted her and called it out which she confirmed. Said she wasn‚Äôt ready for sex yet and didn‚Äôt want to hold me back. Also wasn‚Äôt keen on the every other week dating. Not sure what I could have done differently.

The convo didn't flow easily,  and I was a little bored but hung in there to give it a fair chance and to be polite. It was hot and humid, so I kept playing with my long hair and pulling it off the back of my neck. 

We had very different interests and so I thanked him for the date, I said he was a nice guy but I just wasn't feeling the romantic vibe, but wished him the best of luck. 

He asked me if I was sure? He said that this had happened with another lady he dated,  and he suggested to her that she Google sexual attraction because when ladies play with their hair, it means they are subconsciously sexually attracted to the guy. According to him,  the other lady did that and had some kind of epiphany that OMG she WAS attracted to him but just didn't know it!! Then they dated another two times. 

I'm like laughing hard and said ""so you think I should Google to check if I'm sexually attracted to you???"". I then told him that things had just got quite awkward so I was going to go.  

I thought that was the end of it. Two days later, I'm at work and there's a message from him. I open it to find a dick pic and a message saying ""Not all guys are equal. You should know that right?

He has made comments when giving his friend advice on dating and uses me as reference regarding when women are difficult to read rather than push them move at their pace and take it slow and don‚Äôt make them uncomfortable. So as I‚Äôve been waiting for him to tell me he loves me I realize that he may be waiting for me to let my guard down and say it first so that he doesn‚Äôt make me feel uncomfortable.

I do love this man. He is everything I hoped to find. I‚Äôm thankful that he came into my life available and ready for a relationship. He treats me with the most respect and love that I‚Äôve experienced in my entire life. He is my friend, lover, and protector and I truly want him to know how I feel. I‚Äôm just not sure exactly how to say it. 

I, like many others, have a fear of rejection, even though his actions tell me he won‚Äôt reject me my head tells me to tread lightly. In the past I have found myself being the one who gives of myself, shares my feelings and then ultimately has the harsh realization that it‚Äôs just me and the feelings don‚Äôt go both directions. That past relationship stunted my growth for a long time and I have done a lot of work to realize that if something isn‚Äôt reciprocated it is best to know but also that everyone feels things differently and that‚Äôs ok too.

42,ms25s2,1618576340,On Perfection (and why we‚Äôre still single),"The following is taken from an article I read, which is linked at the bottom:

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
There are two new dating stereotypes that have cropped up this generation. They are:

1. The man who is fat, balding, underemployed, anti-social, unhygienic, who decorates his apartment with his collection of original, mint-condition, Star Wars action figures (all in fighting poses), who spends his weekends engrossed in Manga comic books and internet porn, and who is then perpetually frustrated that every woman he likes is somehow unable to appreciate all of his amazing qualities. He then comes to the conclusion that ‚Äî obviously ‚Äî there‚Äôs something horribly wrong with the women in the world.

2. The fashionable, beautiful, 30-something, career woman who wants to settle down, but despite having dates lined up every night of the week, she laments that there are ‚Äúno good men out there.‚Äù The last man she dated was an accountant, played racquetball and spoke French. But she dumped him because he had bad fingernails and didn‚Äôt want to go to business school. The man before that won the Nobel Prize in chemistry, but she dumped him because chemistry is such an impractical profession anyway ‚Äî I mean, really, get a clue!

The man feels entitled to date anyone despite the fact that he brings basically nothing to the table in an intimate/sexual relationship. The woman brings something to the table, but feels entitled to date someone who brings everything to the table in an intimate/sexual relationship. Both are terribly delusional in regards to their dating expectations.

These flavors of delusional expectations come down to perfection ‚Äî people who expect perfection in others and people who expect others to acknowledge the perfection in themselves. It‚Äôs debatable which is more insufferable.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Thoughts? There are many good points in the full article, but this part struck me because there are so many people who seem to focus on the red flags and scream ‚Äúred flag! Run!‚Äù at the first sign of imperfection. And let‚Äôs not get hung up on the gendered examples. There are men and women in both categories.

In my area, most guys on OLD have animals in their life.  I do too, but they are chickens, geese, etc that do not typically come in the house. I find myself just eliminating men with animals pics from the start because I would never expect someone to get rid of an animal.

45,ms3dkf,1618580447,Staying Safe and Protecting your Privacy while using OLD,"Hello I am a Systems Administrator and just getting back in the dating  world  and using OLD. 

I am surprised at how many women are giving me there real cell phone number for the first conversion (I know I am not a creep stalker) but they do not. 

In the OLD dating world is is a lot different then the collage bar days of the past. You new what the person looked like or you had a freind in common extra and if there were a creep well you told your freind and they yelled at them. 

So I wanted to put a quick note up hear on how to get a temporary phone number so you can keep  yours private until you are ready to give them the real one.

Why should I do this when I can just block them ?

Well there are web sites  out there that will do a reverse phone number search and give up your address. Also if you ever put your phone number on a site for a event or something like that google could find it and well then I have your full name extra. (That is how I found out who my wife was sleeping with) 

Yea it is scary when you think about it but you can protect your self. 

Free version 

google voice this will give  you a digital phone number and be anywhere  you choose and it can get text messages and phone calls there is even an app for  iphone and android.

If you want to pay there are some other services out there 

 [Burner](https://www.burnerapp.com/)  (this app will allow you to delete the number when done

 [Hushed](https://www.hushed.com/)  (also allows you make international calls for long distance dating) 

You can also used  WhatsApp Messenger 

Please if you have any other tricks or apps that you have used please comment them

53,msbd14,1618603738,"Ladies, let's assume wanting someone who makes you laugh, is honest, caring and decent is the baseline prerequisite and work from there","I fully realise men probably do something similar (please share that) but this is a man (49M)'s experience. 

Was on Hinge recently going through a lot of profiles trying to feel inspired, but I lost count of the number of women who, when answering a prompt like ""We'll get on if..."" or ""My idea of the perfect partner is..."" will answer with the same stuff time after time after time: someone who will make them laugh, who is honest and decent, who is trustworthy and a good listener. 

Whatever the reason for choosing to answer the prompts this way, it would make life a little easier for everyone if we all assume that wanting someone decent with a sense of humour and a good, decent attitude is a given. Then we can get to the fun, interesting stuff faster. 

By our age we've all had our fair share of bad relationship experiences. We've maybe been treated poorly by an ex, not experienced joy or laughter for quite some time, felt trapped, alone, or worse, and we want something bright and new and reassuring in our lives. It's why we are using online dating. 

Sorry, just had to rant. I honestly don't know what stating a desire for someone honest and funny etc would achieve as people who aren't will still make contact anyway, plus it makes starting a conversation very difficult.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/msbd14/ladies_lets_assume_wanting_someone_who_makes_you/

59,msh826,1618622803,Women: Don‚Äôt Be Afraid To Show Your Humor!,"Having a good humor, especially about yourself, is a potent attraction. While I can‚Äôt tell a joke to save my life, I do feel comfortable with making comments that are intended to be funny and, I think, generally are received as such.

It has been my experience, though, that many women are not so comfortable. To be sure, men may be just as awkward about it or, worse, like to make off-color or derogatory jokes but as one who only dates women, I am less familiar (in the dating context) in a mens sense of humor. Almost all of my dates express strong interest in a man who has a good sense of humor and I think that I usually meet that criteria, judging by reactions. 

I also really appreciate humor from my date for many reasons : humor is healthy and fun (when appropriate), it helps build rapport (at least if both parties have a compatible sense of humor) and it is a sign - to me - that my date has self confidence, a very attractive and sexy trait. My experience may be atypical but I don‚Äôt think that, traditionally, women were encouraged to be funny - some idiocy about not being ‚Äúladylike.‚Äù I hope that this is changing. Even if a joke falls flat, I appreciate the effort and actually do what I can to encourage more.

I do know that women can have wicked senses of humor, especially in the company of other women. Please share it with your date. I understand that some men react poorly to funny women and women have more to worry about when men take something the wrong way. Humor can be a high wire act and shouldn‚Äôt be overdone (or over emphasized) but, speaking as one guy, I‚Äôd love to hear more humor from women.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/msh826/women_dont_be_afraid_to_show_your_humor/

61,msi4bu,1618626188,What Are We (exactly),"I (40F) met this guy (38M) online. We started as hook up buddy which is okay. Meet atleast every other week. We became exclusive and enjoy each other. Very cleared from the beginning that it is casual only and no accidental pregnancy. That was since Jan. this year (2021). Our communication is up and down, crazy and roller coaster. Sometimes we argue like husband and wife then after few mins, we‚Äôre okay again. Next days or two, we‚Äôre texting crazy like talking about mistakes, whose fault who do what. We‚Äôre like Tom and Gerry but within the day we‚Äôre back talking as if nothing happens. We update each other whoever is busy. 

He doesn‚Äôt want to have a child and it became issues at some point when I asked why/what if etc. He pulled away and if I let him do what he is doing, he came back. There are cancelled meet ups, we fight about it then we‚Äôre okay again.

I will admit that I came to the point that I decided to cut him off completely. Sometimes I‚Äôm thinking maybe we can drop off the sex part and remain friends. We laughed, we pissed off each other, we annoyed each other but at the end of the day, we‚Äôre still okay.

This week is the most chaotic part so far. Something happened. It was a terrible unexpected situation he created. The text confrontation was epic. He came to the point he told me ‚Äúdo not contact me anymore‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre acting like gf or wife, we‚Äôre over etc etc etc.
And I also said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm totally done and tired of you and I have no plan to be your gf or wife. You‚Äôre imagining things‚Äù. That fight goes on for a week texting nasty words to each other since Monday. Now is Friday and we ended up texting each other again and kinda patching up things and establishing what to do and what not to do so we can avoid chaos again.

I make it a policy to not connect via social media when I‚Äôm dating someone.  If early on we know it‚Äôs not going anywhere and we are strictly friends, I‚Äôm ok with that. But if it looks like things may go ‚Äúsomewhere‚Äù I don‚Äôt. I get a lot of shit about this. I am of the mindset that I would prefer you get to know me instead of being a voyeur in my life and think you know me. 

If things dont work out, and we part amicably I usually leave social media alone .  I‚Äôve dated and had break ups that got awkward only for them to check in months later. I recently have decided to block and delete contact info and block on all social media accounts.  Anyone else have this mentality?  Just curious on what others are doing. I don‚Äôt do this with malice- I just think my time is valuable and I don‚Äôt want anyone being a voyeur in my life that doesn‚Äôt add value.

74,msvjw6,1618682248,"Dating a single mom, should I?","Hey guys,

Need some advice, good, bad, ugly I want to hear it.

A bit about me:

I‚Äôm 41, divorced, 3 kids. I own a successful business, hit the gym daily, have a good social life, interesting hobbies, and have had an abundance of potential women offer to do life with me. 

I have dated every age group and walk of life, and previously had ruled out single moms due to the lack of time they have for a relationship and also due to my lifestyle. 

I generally am pretty carefree when my kids aren‚Äôt here. I like to boat, have cocktails, have lots of sex, have friends over, travel. Basically a very traditional single lifestyle. 

Here‚Äôs the thing. I met someone that I am seriously into, and she has two small kids. 

She clicks all of the boxes for me personally, and I would love to spend my life with someone like her. 

Lately I‚Äôve been feeling like this single lifestyle is getting old, I‚Äôm getting old, there has to be more substance to my life. 

Has anyone here successfully been with a single mom long term? Am I crazy for considering this? 

I am currently dating a 24 year old ex model and feeling like what the heck am I doing. Should I just settle down and join this amazing woman?

For context she‚Äôs 34, which also I‚Äôm a little worried about. Why? I have no idea I‚Äôm just used to the late 20s girls at the gym I guess. 

I‚Äôm sorry to ramble, just so confused. Hoping you guys can help me through this.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/msvjw6/dating_a_single_mom_should_i/

78,mt131x,1618700341,Where have all the good women gone?,"I‚Äôve been dating again for the past year and a half. (Great timing, I know). The majority of women I have ‚Äúmet‚Äù online, or dated, are either:
- Very flaky
- Have an agenda (money)
- Very likely to lose interest and ghost (which is a rude way to handle things)

It seems to me that women have access to so many men online that they don‚Äôt seem to think they have to try anymore, they don‚Äôt need to be respectful, or they think they can scam men for money.

The number of times where...

I‚Äôve been stood-up... (really? In the age of mobile phones and messaging apps? How rude)...

Or I‚Äôve struck-up a great conversation only for her to tell me that she‚Äôs dropped her phone and cannot afford to get it fixed (hint, hint)...

Or they‚Äôve just taken advantage... One time, my date chose her favourite (expensive) restaurant, happily talked non-stop throughout the date, then suggested we stick around for cocktails. She then told me she was going to smoke a quick cigarette outside, and didn‚Äôt come back... leaving me with a rather hefty bill to pay. Of course, by the time I had realised she wasn‚Äôt coming back, she had blocked me on social media.

I guess ‚Äúa girl‚Äôs gotta eat‚Äù (as Phoebe Buffay said in Friends)...

I detailed my most recent date (a week ago) in another post, so I won‚Äôt repeat all that. But, it seemed to go really well, and then I got blocked and ghosted. Now, I understand some people are dealing with the trauma of previous relationships, but treat people with some respect! Otherwise, why go on the date?

Are there any women out there who realise men are human beings, and deserve a bit more respect? Or do you have similar experiences dating men?

Is there any respect for other beings anymore? Or is humanity itself just heading for the sewer?

Their answers, whatever they are, are not necessarily a deal breaker for me as long as they are aware of their patterns and working on themselves. 

At our age and with decades of dating/relationship experience behind us, is the first date too soon to talk about this, after a good amount of banter to make sure we seem compatible and to have chemistry? I feel like in both cases their answers were fine, I wasn't judgmental at all, and let them know that I was still interested and appreciated them having opened up, but after this conversation they sort of shut things down and ended the date, even after the dates had been going well until that point.

I‚Äôve had a few people not leave me alone in the past. I‚Äôm looking for someone who has enough going on that they don‚Äôt feel like talking and texting all the time and posting things on Facebook. 
Talking twice a week and seeing each other every other week is a perfect pace for me to get to know someone. 
Initially. 
Of course once I‚Äôm in a real relationship with someone I know well those things will be normal. But not after a first date. 
This guy and I had the best day yesterday. I was wary before because he kept texting and seemed a bit too eager and into focusing on my happiness first but I gave it a chance. 
Then I got home and he keeps texting me. I didn‚Äôt respond to the last four or five because it was late and I started feeling like he was moving too fast for me. It was a conversation for the morning. 
He‚Äôd Facebook friend requested me earlier which I accepted and immediately felt weird about. 
Then at eleven pm he posts on my Facebook page about how great our date was with a heart.
To me that feels so yuck. Like he‚Äôs marking his territory for other men to know. I immediately deleted the post and blocked him on every place we could connect. 
Am I alone in my dislike of men posting things to my Facebook page that I‚Äôm not in a real relationship with? 
It feels very invasive to me. 
A really nice guy I actually like did it a while back and it kinda wrecked how I felt about him. He tried to reach out after awkwardly but it never went anywhere.

I thought of divorce since almost the beginning off and on, but felt trapped because I have 2 kids, now 16 and 10 ‚Äî I have full custody (ex is out of state). I have recently been diagnosed with ADHD and have realized that some of the struggles with that definitely affected my relationship and social life in general. I didn‚Äôt have very much dating / sex life experience before I got married at age 22, and what experience I did have was kind of sad. I didn‚Äôt know how to communicate well and had this idea that romantic relationships were totally different than friendships so would act not really like myself.

Will people be scared off by my past once I tell them about it? Will men be terrible to me because I‚Äôm not thin or particularly in shape (but working on it)? How long do you wait before disclosing all the crap you‚Äôve gone through?
