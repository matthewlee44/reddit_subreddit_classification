But we had a backup plan. That was to have a quiz at my place instead. But when we got home, none of us really wanted a quiz so we decided to rent a horror movie instead. We chilled at the couch, talked for maybe an hour before we turned the movie on.  


Found some snacks and ordered some Italian pizza. We managed to talk about a lot during that first hour. She let me into her mind for once. I always wondered what she was really thinking and yesterday she shared it.  


She flirted a lot in the beginning and we were sitting right next to each others on the couch. The movie lasted for about 3 hours. It was over midnight by the time the movie was over and she fell asleep without me noticing somewhere within the last 30 minutes of the movie.  


I didnt want to wake her up so I eventually went to bed. When I woke up the next morning she was still sleeping in the exact same spot. We ate some breakfast and I followed her home. She told me that we had to go to the movies next time and that I should message her if I feel bored.

Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

But recently it has been more obvious, especially because the way he treats me and other students is so different. 

He is not doing anything to make me uncomfortable, I actually even enjoy this, so I was wondering how do I turn this into something more (after I graduate of course). I really grew to like him, and he seems to like me, so I would like to take the next step. At this time I do not care about officially dating and stuff, I would just like to get more “intimate” with him.

Maybe the post will help you or maybe you can help me 😊.

I (21F) have OCD and I mostly suffer from OCD thoughts. I have been -almost daily- talking to a guy since may of this year. We met on Badoo, thanks to COVID-19. 

I don’t have a lot of experience even though I am passed the age of 20:

- I have been on dates before
- I have dated one guy for a year but we eventually broke up due to the pandemic, living in two different countries (Netherlands and Belgium) etc.
- I don’t think I have ever truly been in love 💔
- I am STILL a virgin at 21. I know I am not the only one but it is an insecurity of mine. 

Anyways like I said before, we met online and have been talking on a nearly daily basis. We are not exclusive yet (obviously)and we are both talking to other people but I am the most serious about this guy. We have had an online date ( I wanted to see if he was actually real) and tomorrow is our first IRL date!

Ever since we started talking my OCD has flared up (once again). I have a lot of negative thoughts and worries: 

- What if he does not like the fact that I am still a virgin?
- Are guys on dating apps truly honest? Even if he says that he wants to be in a committed relationship?
- What if it actually goes well and I want to talk about exclusivity and monogamy? How do I do that? What if it goes wrong?
- How do I tell him I would like him to get tested before we are intimate?
- How do I tell him that I am not on BC yet so we have to wait a little before we have sex?
- How do I tell him I won’t have sex without a condom until he has been tested, I am on BC and we are exclusive? And if we do we will use pull-out as well. 
- How do I tell him that I am still a bit scared to have sex without a condom in general? I am afraid of pregnancy 
- How do I tell him I would prefer it if he gets tested before we get intimate?
- How do I tell him that if he does not get tested I will always use a condom for every type of sex?
- What type of contraception should I get?
- What if I still get pregnant using the copper IUD?
- What if something goes wrong using the copper IUD? How do I check the strings etc? What if I mess it up?
- What if he does not want to wait until I have birth control or am comfortable with the idea of having sex without a condom. 

Etc, etc, etc. 

As you can see I am obviously the queen of overthinking 👸👑
These thoughts and many more haunt me 24/7.
It is very very difficult to fight these thoughts even with all the tips and tricks that I use on a daily basis. 

Maybe you would like to know more about the guy. Maybe you are wondering what kind of person he is/seems to be:

- on his profile he says that he is looking for a committed relationship.
- He likes honesty.
- He respects other people’s boundaries.
- He does not have a lot of experience with dating and no experience with relationships. He might be a virgin as well I don’t know.
- He must like me as well, we have been talking since may.
- He did not mind FaceTiming before meeting. He seems a bit more serious than most guys our age. 


Anyways this has been my experience up until now. Tomorrow is our first true date.

Hope you’re all having a good weekend. Bit of a vent post but also just kind of confused idk where I stand in this situation. 

Been seeing this girl for like 5/6 months now. Things haven’t been super intense, we’ve only met around 7/8 times in that time as both been super busy etc etc, but recently we’ve seen eachother twice in the space of a week I stayed at hers etc, all seems to be going well. 

Tonight I took her out for dinner, was at a pretty nice restaurant that she picked out and I had said before I wanted to take her for a meal and she was super flattered and grateful. The meal was really nice, and we left having laughed a lot etc. When we got outside we sat for a while finishing our drinks, I had a pretty stressful work thing going on that I had to text some colleagues about and I apologised to her as it was super important. So I just messaged the work stuff as she was sat there but I said a number of times that I was sorry for seeming rude etc, and since we know eachother pretty well now it didn’t seem out of place. Once i had finished the work conversation she had gone super quiet and said she felt really anxious and stressed. I apologised and reassured her it was okay. She said she just wanted to go home because she felt bad so I said I’d walk her back. On the walk we kissed and held hands, things seemed better. But by the time get back to hers she said she felt bad again, she went super pale and said she felt unwell. We kissed again but she said she needed to just go to bed. I said I could go and she was super apologetic but said it was probs for the best. We kissed goodbye and I left. As soon as I left I felt awful. I’m overthinking everything. Was I the reason she felt bad ? Did I stress her out ? I’m convinced she’s going to call things off now and if she does I’ll be gutted, I really like her. 

Not sure where to go from here or what to say without just sounding needy or misunderstanding. I’m sad that she feels bad and it could’ve been something to do with what I did? What do I do now!

I graduated from college, i've worked a few years, took time off for myself... really didn't meet many people, so it goes without saying i didn't meet any women

anyways i am now 30, and i am thinking about joining some classes i am interested in. of course if i meet someone nice that'd be great but I am doing it mostly because i enjoy the class and i want to meet new people.

anyone who went this route and got success? activity groups could be anything like a running club, a sports league recreational, craft &amp; arts, movie night, whatever

I'm 25 and I've never been in a relationship. Never kissed. Never had sex. Was a loner in high school and college. So yes. I've never had a close group of buddies. There were things that happened in my adolescent years I just never got over and perhaps, I never will. People have told me that I need to properly mourn my lost teenage years and move on, but I'm not the type to let things go until it is properly given.

I'll be real. I feel I have fallen way behind people my age and I can't help but feel an intense resentment towards my peers. This will be controversial here, but if I was given an option all my friends and my fantasy girlfriend would be around 18 to 20. I just never got to have those adventurous college years and knowing how people my age are busy, they won't nearly reciprocate as they did when I was younger.

All I'm trying to say is that I'm trying to fill the void that was left empty but I know the chances of befriending people of that age group get less likely as the years go by. And people my age aren't exactly teenagers anymore. I just don't relate to people my age. Any relationship whether friend or romantic with my age group will not live up to what I want it to be. I just feel I missed out on the boat in human connection and my interest in any human relationship just steadily slides down.

My depression has steadily increased these past few years and as time goes, the more I hate people. Human relationships are just one big silly game for little reward. I feel empty.

Here's the truth. My maturity isn't really up to par. If I indeed have children one day (I have doubts if I will), I won't be ready to raise any till at least my 40's from a maturity perspective. I can sense the women in this sub ready to blast me right now. If you want to label me a creep. Go on. I don't know what the purpose of this post was but one thing is clear, I've had enough of my existence.

She has a high stress sounding job in a mental heath field. We had a first lunch date, and she seem very nervous (hard time making eye contact, speaking very formally). But she did laugh a lot, and we had a lot in common. 

For a second date we went hiking. She again seemed VERY nervous, but I was expected it and tried to make her as comfortable as possible. Again easy conversation, and we had a lot in common. We stopped at a bench half way through, and I started very lightly touching her hand etc. and she was touching my arm back. I asked if I could kiss her (which normally seems formal, but given how nervous she was I thought it was a good idea). She said ""yes"" very shyly, but when I kissed her she started kissing me as fast as possibly, like she'd been waiting the whole date. She also mentioned she hasn't dated anyone in ""years""

After we kissed we ended up having a surprising intense conversation. The conversation flowed naturally, but among the things she mentioned was 1) she is a virgin at 28, 2) she has a ton of anxiety around dating 3) she mom is bipolar, 4) she wants kids. I honestly don't remember how kids came up, but a fairly intense conversation for a 2nd date. I didn't really know how big of a deal the 28 year old virgin thing was, she said if after I mentioned going slow. 

She then setup a 3rd date, saying there is a pool at her apartment complex, and that I should come over. She reminded me about this at the end of the date, and then texted me about it. She didn't text much the next week. Finally, today she texts me more or less saying ""I've been thinking a lot, and I don't think I am in a place in my life where I am ready to start a relationship."" I asked her if I kissed her too fast and she said no. 

I very carefully mentioned that maybe she was having anxiety about starting a relationship since she hasn't been in one for a long time. She acknowledged that ""there are a lot of layers to it"" but still seemed to want to end things. 

This is the strongest connection I have felt towards someone in a very long time. I really liked her, and felt like we had a lot in common. I also have a lot of anxiety, and find it very easy to relate to her. I am complete fine with her being a virgin and going slow (and I said that). I don't know what I should do now. Is there anything left I can say? I told her that I like her, and she continues to say she had a great time, and just isn't ready to date. 

I honestly kind of feel like she panicked either at the idea of intimacy, or at how fast it was going emotionally. Is there anything left I can say to her? She is still responding to text, but keeps more or less saying she isn't in a place in her life to date.

Anyway, the big reason I get the feeling she might reciprocate my feelings is cus she always complimenting my appearance, saying she like certain things about me (humor and behavior), and today she legit said she loved me to my coworker. 
This is how the scenario went down. I dropped by her room to check something out and we were talking with some other coworkers as well. And I said something that made her laugh as I was leaving and after I was out the door in the hallway I heard her tell my coworker she loved me.
 I'm assuming she doesn't mean ""in love"" with me but more as in she loves being around me and she has a fun time with me. The thing is our work environment is really friendly and we complement each other (coworkers) all the time. Her complements feel different then the regular ""you look so cute in those pants"" or ""you look great with your hair up."" She will tell me how she likes certain things about my personality or how I talk. We are both women and I personally think it's a lot easier to compliment other women so maybe it's just that?

""I'm afraid I'm busy that day but maybe in a couple of weeks.""

I told her not to worry about it and proceeded to delete our conversation, lol. Felt very embarrassed even though I had previously told myself that I wouldn't stress the outcome. I don't know, something about the lack of enthusiasm in her reply made me feel kind of awkward about it all. Like, she couldn't bother to reschedule, she literally just said she was busy that specific day and threw me a bone by saying ""maybe in a couple of weeks"".

Oh well, at least now I know where she stands and I can free up the mental space she was occupying rent free.

I've been working out for years now and can lift a lot more than the average gym goer. I'm not fat and am just over 6 feet tall, but I cant seem to establish any meaningful relationship w a girl. I would say I'm pretty popular as well so the social aspect shouldn't be a deal breaker. I've been working so hard in the gym for probably 4 years now and I really like how I filled out, but I have got no interest from girls. It's honestly a shame because I would assume they'd prefer a guy whos in shape as opposed to guys w dad bods. Tbh I can't even get a cute girl walking past me to check me out. The only thing I can think of is that they're intimidated by me and are disinterested right away. I really dont even know how to make myself better from this point and feel pretty confused in this situation. I always try to ask them questions and keep the convo going, but I can't get any girl to follow up. I can't even think of the last time a girl approached me.
