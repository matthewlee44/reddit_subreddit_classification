I am starting to develop feelings for him but I don’t know if I should date him or not. Advice is so appreciated. Please read the whole post. Thanks!

So I’ve been seeing a guy I met online for a week now. He’s really kind and we get on well on multiple fronts. It’s honestly been really hard finding someone who shares my values and beliefs and wants a lot of the same things I want. However, when it comes to Covid he isn’t careful. He doesn’t wear his mask around most of his friends. He says that he is mindful of who he’s hanging out with based on their ages and that he will wear a mask if he’s around older people. However he has a vibrant social life in person and this really concerns me. I explained to him that my dad is getting cancer treatments and that I want him to get vaccinated if he decides he wants to keep dating me. At first he said he would and now he says he’s open but he’s wary of the negative effects of the vaccine. He told me yesterday that he doesn’t think it’s very likely he’ll catch the virus so he’s not worried about himself. He thinks that mainstream media blows the virus out of proportion. Regarding Covid he is clearly very ignorant. 

I told him that he should get vaccinated to protect himself at the very least since I am developing feelings for him don’t want to lose him to Covid. He said that he’ll look into it but that he doesn’t think getting vaccinated will stop the spread of the virus and he’s not worried about himself getting Covid. Even if getting vaccinated doesn’t stop the spread of Covid, What I don’t think he realizes is how you can be a carrier of Covid without symptoms. I feel too frustrated and tired to explain all the basics to him that I’ve been keeping up with all year (cause I pay attention) and I wonder how he could be so ignorant about the risks of Covid. I told him that I value keeping others safe and said that he should too. He understands my viewpoint but seems to want to look at both sides (and is veering towards not taking Covid safety that seriously as a result). 

What gets me is that he isn’t always wearing a mask around people to completely minimize spreading the virus. How do I convince him to value safety more if it’s already been over a year of the pandemic and he isn’t being careful? I told him that love looks like sacrifice and that you can be creative in how you get your social needs met without putting others at risk. He said that mental health matters more than getting Covid and that love should require some risk as well. Although he agrees with me about the importance of being careful it still appears he doesn’t care much to protect others. 

He told me on our last date that he thinks my ask for him to get vaccinated is oddly specific and feels a bit demanding but he understands my situation with my dad having cancer. But he fears I’ll be demanding about other things down the line. He wanted me to understand that getting vaccinated is a personal choice as an American and I told him that while I wouldn’t push that on friends, it’s different in a dating context. I said that he doesn’t have to date me but that that’s where I stand on the issue and that I need a partner who values accommodating me to help me feel safe. He said he’ll look into getting the vaccine but can’t promise me he will get it.

I like him for other reasons than his ignorant viewpoint on Covid. I don’t know how to keep discussing my frustration and fear over his lack of safety. I fear that if I am too harsh with him that it will kill the delicate connection that’s budding between us. I also fear that if I ask him to wear a mask around all his friends he won’t do it because he’ll think I’m being too demanding and intrusive of his “American freedom.” Maybe I’m just desperate for a relationship but I actually think he’s worth it to get to know given all the other things we have in common.  However, I can see that he’s stubborn and kind of a devils advocate but has a lot of ignorance too as well as uninformed opinions. What do you recommend I do to communicate my concerns with him at this early of a stage in our relationship? I hate confrontation and have a lot of emotions attached to this whole issue with Covid.

He seemed intelligent, enjoyed reading, a little on the nerdy side but seeing as how I work in tech this is ok with me. We meet up for coffee and have a good time, lots of laughs, he talks about his cat, absolutely nothing creepy or sexual. I tell him that I'm not looking for a relationship or a hook up. I tell him I just got out of a long relationship and also we discuss Tinder experiences. I tell him I am going with a friends-first/ no expectations, slow approach. He seems to understand this. 

We meet up again, this time for a drink. Everything is going pretty well but he's being a little more animated and talking a little too much about sci-fi nerdy crap, like asking me if I could be a were-animal of some kind what would I be (were-wolf, were-jaguar, etc). I'm getting a bit bored and thinking that this is a bit *too* nerdy for me. At that point he is many drinks in and despite me only having one I'm feeling a little bit buzzed and know I should not drive home at that point. 

He lives very close by and suggests his place for me to wait a little while before driving home. I knew there was some risk but he was pretty harmless so far and I clearly stated boundaries before we left for his house. Apartment is very clean he gives me plenty of space on the couch and I observe all exits and keep my phone in hand. Seems alright. We watch an episode of something. The restaurant we were at gave us take home drinks but I don't have any of mine. He finishes his and goes to his fridge for another. This is at least beer #4 and it's been about 2-3 hours. During the show episode at one point he gets closer to me on the couch and asks if he can touch my hair. I have curly hair. I tell him he can't run his fingers through it, no. So he starts like petting my head and my hair.  :/     

Episode is now just about over so I tell him I should get going. It's been over an hour now I'm feeling sober and I'm ready to GTFO. I'd rather sit on the side of the road in my car taking a nap than in here a minute more. At that point, this guy leans in to try and kiss me. WTF. WTF. I pull away and say ""whoa, what's going on here?"" He's like ""oh sorry I misinterpreted things."" Um, misinterpreted what? I sat nowhere near you the whole night and just said I was leaving. What part of that gave you the impression I wanted you to kiss me? Also, covid. I'm not about to be kissing strangers! At this point I disclose that I am also immune compromised and won't be kissing him for that reason, in addition to the above reasons. He pretends he doesn't know what this means. Imagine, a college-educated middle-aged man who is living through a pandemic claiming ignorance on this. 

He tries desperately to keep me in his apartment by showing me some books. Doing weird voices and talking about Nordic gods. I politely look at the book and when he is in the bathroom I put my shoes on and wait by the door. He says he will walk me out to my car. Fine, whatever. He tells me that he understands about the no kissing stuff and if I'm alright with it maybe I can come over and play video games sometime. At this point I'm not going to say no as I don't want to get stuck there having him try to convince me to say yes so I give a vague non-committal answer and finally (!) I'm at my car but he's standing in front of the car door. It's raining a bit and cold, so after a few mins of more conversation I tell him I'm cold and want to get in. He moves out of the way, great, finally I can get in my car. Then he stands in the doorway so I can't close it. I'm like, ok bye. Then, he pats his lips motioning for me to kiss him (ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS RIGHT NOW). I tell him no again, he moves I shut to door and take off. 

I blocked him and unmatched him but he texted me this morning. Not sure how, since I blocked his number on my phone. :/

Now here's where the fuck up begins. She shared her professional website with me to take a look. In it was obviously a link to her professional instagram and from there it wasn't hard to find her personal instagram, which was public. So I do a small stalk, see what she's about as a person (which only makes me more interested in her because she seems legit) and then during my scroll, my finger slips.... and I accidentally like a picture she posted of her ex-boyfriend. I immediately unlike but had a strong feeling that my fate was sealed.

And well, since then? I've been blocked. What a shame, but I definitely don't blame her.

I’ve been seeing a guy for about 2 months now, typically 2x/week and texting pretty much every day.

I was really impressed by how direct of a communicator he was about what he was looking for and how clearly he liked me - on our third date we went to a baseball game and shared our first kiss and the next day he texted me “That was the most fun I’ve had in years. I can’t stop smiling.” So, no ambiguity. :D

But, about 2 weeks ago I stopped feeling the enthusiasm. He’d proactively text me but not carry on much of a convo. The last time I saw him (2 weekends ago) I mentioned I’d love to hang out again and he kind of deflected, noncommittally saying yeah, we should. I stopped receiving as many flirty texts from him and within the past week they began to feel much more functional and formal. My gut said he maybe found someone else on the dating apps he liked more, but didn’t want to sever our thing until he confirmed the other thing.

After not hearing from him for almost four days, I sent a check-in text intending to ask if he had lost interest. He replied that his aunt had passed away (unexpectedly) the day before. We’re Facebook friends and he later shared the update there so I know this was true. I offered support but did not force myself upon him. It’s kind of a weird stage in dating where we’re close enough that I know his mom’s maiden name but not so close that I’d be a good shoulder to cry on. So, I basically said, I’m so sorry, let me know what you need, and left it at that.

He did not say “give me some time to process this and I’ll reach back out” or anything like that. Just “thanks.”

I feel awful even asking this question and making it about me but don’t know where else to go. Do I just stop talking to him and if he’s interested he’ll reach back out on his own timeline? Check in in a few weeks? Does it seem obvious he had lost interest in me before this happened? On one hand I’d assume based on his personality he’d be very direct if he wasn’t interested — on the other hand I’m sure more direct men have slow burned out before.

So a girl I use to see is now seeing somebody else. Long story short she claims I wasn’t giving her enough attention and reassuring her (I felt like I did but that’s another story), meanwhile a different guy was so she started seeing him instead. I was super pissed when she told me because she had literally told me before I shouldn’t talk to other girls if I was seeing her, so her doing that to me blindsided me. I told her I was pissed and said she shouldn’t have done it but she brushed it off and said she didn’t know how to tell me, I find that a poor excuse but oh well. We’ve since been talking as friends every day ever since, I’ve found it quite awkward and pointless and tried to kinda break it off a few times, but she keeps telling me I shouldn’t find it awkward and we should continue talking. I find it confusing because she’s also mentioned multiple times there’s nothing between us anymore and I shouldn’t think there is, so naturally I said ok let’s stop talking then, to which she didn’t like and said I shouldn’t do that. I’m really not sure what to do anymore, I see 0 point in continuing to talk as friends, I don’t want to be her friend and never have, I’ve always wanted to be more than that so it just seems pointless to me. Every time I try and explain this to her she says I’m being mean to hear and trying to blame her for what happened.

And I dislike giving out my phone number to people I don't know.

I don't live in the US, privacy and dating is different here, and because I was raised in the US for a time but became a teenager in my country my personality is both different from north americans and people in my birth country, so I always feel a little disconnected and confused with social and dating norms.

So onto the meat of the issue, being on Tinder I get a little nervous when people send me texts but I still try to answer, but sometimes I avoid texts and continue swipping. I don't know if i'm avoiding the conversation ir seeing what else is ""out there"", but at the end of the day things don't really go far. In fact I have never gone on a date with someone off Tinder and I'm not very experienced in general (I've only been on one or two actual dates with one person).

I'd like to put in the effort and start texting a few people first but at the same time I have some other conversations on backlog (or others who grew stale but I haven't erased), what are ethics of chatting multiple matches and does it help?

What I mean by this is that for an extended period of time, I'm not really making any connections with anyone, or not meeting people I'm excited about, or maybe the people I'm excited about just don't like me back. Then out of nowhere in a short period of time, I really click with 3 or 4 different people. Or another thing that happens is that I've got a slightly flirty friendship with someone that turns into something more *at the same time* I meet someone new who seems really great.

Either way I'm suddenly juggling all these dates and forming the beginnings of a strong bond with multiple women... but then before long each relationship is progressing to the point where there's going to be some expectations of exclusivity, and I have to make some hard decisions and have some sad discussions when I decide who I'm going to continue seeing.

The practical part of my brain finds this scenario really frustrating, because if the one relationship doesn't work out, it's not like I can go back to one of the other women and say, ""Well, it didn't work out with that other chick, so you're next!"" or something. Instead I've got to go through the whole process of meeting new people and trying to find someone I click with. Makes me wish I met them in sequence rather than at the same time. 

And the non-practical part of my brain just finds it really depressing to stop seeing women whom I've strongly connected with. It's really sad to end something promising.

I’m not out (cause honestly I think it’s stupid someone has to come out to be who they are) (but at the same time no one knows I’m (21M) bi) and come across as straight. Anyways, throughout high school and even now I have a crush on a male friend (“straight” very religious family) and I assumed he did too. There were times when travelling away for a school trip where we both would sit next to each other and if one of us felt the other touch the others leg with our leg we would touch back. One time when he was walking slow I nudged him by putting my hand form against his but and he pushed back into my hand. Another time during p.e he tried to steal a ball from me and he groped me (I obviously was welcome to it), there’s plenty more things that we’ve done that gave me the indication that we could be more than friends. But come last year I had messaged him to have lunch, and when he arrived he just asked straight up, why did I want to be friends with him, and I said well we’ve been friends for a while and you don’t hang out with anyone so why wouldn’t I? And he just said I think I know why and I’m straight and want a family, children, to be married etc etc. I told him well that’s questionable especially how he’s acted to me in the past, and that I think he’s ashamed (as I said above) because his family is very religious and would not condone him being homosexual. It’s been a year since then and I’m constantly thinking/fantasising about him, I’ve only seen him a few times in the supermarket and that’s about it, he had messaged me once asking to go for lunch but I was busy with work and asked him if he remembered what he said to me last time we saw each other and he just said what has that got to do with going for lunch. So I said sorry I’m working and don’t know when I’ll be free next. It kinda sucks because I’ve talked to mutuals about him and they all figured he was if not gay at least Bi anyhow.

Another friendzoning happened just last weekend, I went to the city and watched a band perform live, had a really great night especially when I kept making eye contact with a really good looking guy. I’d look away then look back and he’d still be looking so I’d give him a smile and he’d smile back, he even bummed a smoke off of me. Anyways later that night I found him online and messaged him telling him that I thought he was hot, and that I was checking him out just as much as he was to me and asked if he would like to meet up . But he responded thank you but I’m straight 🙏🏼 I said oh okay have a good night then. Damn thought I was lucky then.

It’s like there’s some big inside joke that everyone around me understands but I can’t get.

I don’t think I’m that bad of a person. I have a lot of friends, I think I have a good personality. I’m told I’m funny and fun to be around. I know I’m unattractive but I don’t think my standards are high at all. I would date pretty much any woman regardless of how she looked or really even how she treated me. I’d give anything for someone to just want to be with me.

Before I get into it, a little back story of our situation, for whatever it's worth. Me (35F) and my,, errrr .. . person? (28M) have been friends for like 8 or 9 years and the past maybe 4 or so years we became very close, best friends. We both deal with depression so we don't take it personal and know how to help one another cope. What I love most about us is that we aren't carbon copies of each other but rather we mirror one another and compliment one another really well. Our differences have never been stressors, but like a breath of fresh air, a new perspective, an adventure to learn about the other. He has never been married but was engaged to a woman they were together for 5 years. He says all was well until one day he realized she was a pathological liar. About everything, anything, nothing, and all that's in between for no reason. I am twice divorced with 3 children that live in another state with their dad. My first marriage was 9 years, together for 17 years. We met at 11 in 6th grade and the rest was history. I was never able to fully be at peace with letting this marriage go until my new person, so I REALLY live this man so much it's beyond comprehension. Second marriage was all a huge mistake, abusive, married my rebound.... Ooppps. So here we are, a year ago, my friend and I started seeing quite a lot of each other again. We had kinda had a thing a year or 2 prior but timing was wrong and things were going better than I ever hoped or expected. It was a fwb deal kinda at first and we both caught feelings with a quickness. Communication was open, we are both sharp so it was mentally fulfilling, so much team work and laughter but we could also open up deeply so emotionally stable and secure, and the best sex with the most amazing chemistry I've ever had in my entire life. I wanted of nothing. He wasn't ready to be in a relationship and I was happy with exactly what was happening. I felt no pressure for labels and we agreed on monogamy and open communication before hand if either of us want to change that and that no matter what, we will always preserve our friendship above all else. For the first time in my life I was smitten all around in life and he was also. But then I lost my job, financial stress to my recollection is what started this although I really can't tell you how the hell we ended up where we are. Seemingly out of nowhere he started distancing himself. He came over less, barely stayed the night, sex life plummeted, he was stiff arming me. When I asked he said that there were issues and we need to talk but didn't tell me what. After this in going weeks long saga revolving around my hurt and confusion about why he withdrew and why he wouldn't tell me what I apparently did but kept going on about how we needed to have ""the talk"". Come to find out, it came out one day that he totally misconstrued random things I was saying, hearing what he perceived and not what I said, and then would think he was catching me in all these lies and I wouldn't never think twice about a misunderstanding when he was thinking I'm a sudden nonchalant pathological liar about the most absofuckinglutely ridiculous things. I confronted him about trauma issues from his ex which made him flip shit and he denied it. I told him people who lie (or cheat, steal, etc) often accuse their SO of said things from a guilty conscience and was shrugged off. I thought we had sorted through the alleged deceptions and for each one I was able to figure out where the mix up happened and thought we squashed it. But things didn't get better.... Before I knew it we had to have another talk because either I was still apparently lying or what I thought was resolve he thought was me manipulating and bullsh*tting him and then all of a sudden it wasn't lying anymore, it changed to other non sensical things. I genuinely asked him if he has comprehension issues. And then I started to think maybe he's extremely paranoid or traumatized and keeps subconsciously recreating this cycle, or he's just crazy and his ex never lied and he has some sort of maternal trauma that makes his villainize women who take on loving/nurturing roles?? I honestly am at a complete loss. For the past at least 6 months of our year long situationship, where we are both open about the deep love we share, despite the fact that we have each other's backs in all things no matter what, this cycle keeps going on repeat with no break. It hurts so bad, is so confusing, and it's wearing both of us down and destroying us but I literally can't make him stop manufacturing these fantasies from hellfire nightmare land. Ice been pouring my heart into this waiting for improvement only to be met with new criticism or new allegations more and more cold stiff arming now bordering indifference and any stance I take for myself I'm accused of manipulation and gaslighting. He keeps assuring me he lives me and I will get farther with him telling the truth and he really needs me (there have been 3 back to back deaths that have shaken him badly so grief is a definite role here) but the thing is that I don't think he wants the truth because he already has it and rejects it. He just wants me to confess to things I'm not guilty of because to him they're absolutely the realest truth there is. It's so bizarre. He won't communicate ANYTHING to me and I'm left feeling like everything is a riddle or the cruelest most sadistic game EVER. Idk where this is coming from or why but I know who he is outside of these crazy hellish fallacies and I know he genuinely loves me but I have no clue what to do here and I'm quickly reaching my breaking point. Most recently the ""talk"" we're now supposed to be having seems to be about something quite serious although I've never been even hinted to about what it actually IS. and although deception seems to okay a role in this scenario, it isn't just lies this time. I get the feeling he thinks I've been seeing other people but he couldn't be more wrong! I am very faithful to him and love him so much I don't want to be with anyone else. I've even asked him to move in, told him I'd like to marry him, when he comes over I never want him to go. Idk when I'm supposed to have time to do all this debauchery or why he would go there when it's clear as day to everyone but him that he is all I want and the only person I see. So today is supposed to be a hashing out of everything once and for all where it's a make or break kind of deal because we simply cannot go on like this job matter how much love there is and I'm already heartbroken but I'm coming apart from this because I feel like no matter what I say l, unless I agree to his manifestations he's going to say that I refuse to come clean and leave for good saying it's all my fault. I've never wanted to scream and cry and breakdown so bad in all my life. Has anyone ever seen, heard or dealt with something like this?! Or have ANY kind of advice as to how I can handle it without being accused of deflecting, and basically mental abuse? I think this is a mental health thing but Lord knows if I even try to say that I'll be accused of the most ultimately screwed up manipulation to date. I'm just trying to save what I know is a beautiful thing under this falacy of horrors in his mind because I had spent nearly a decade mourning my first divorce and never thought I'd have or feel true love ever again, and was starting to think it wasn't real at all until falling in love with this man in a way that has far surpassed anything I've ever experienced in all my life and he's obviously suffering.

So as an introvert, I find online dating quite hard as it’s not naturally getting to know someone and is obviously artificially set-up. I also think statistically with online dating, it’s quite slim to meet someone you naturally click with. 

So I’m wondering if any other introverts has had a sudden ‘click’ or chemistry with someone they’ve met on a dating app? I’m guessing when you meet someone you click with from the beginning, you do open up right away, as opposed to otherwise feeling like you’re holding back due to natural introversion.

I’m a pretty young man, but quite outspoken for my age, even given the adage ‘old soul’. I feel that could be relevant later. 

I’m probably 4 months out from my previous relationship, though we’ve seen each other since. I’m getting back into the dating world, albeit hesitantly, perhaps subconsciously to a degree. 

I don’t know why, but I can go out and enjoy myself, have plenty of opportunities and options to choose from (many of whom clearly display interest), take the approach and get a point of contact..for nothing to come to fruition. 

I’m quite sure it’s my follow-up that’s needing massive improvement. But this is also the part where my mind doesn’t seem to..almost care? I’ll put it off, then ask why I’m not getting laid? 

I suppose the tricky part is the massive changes taking place in my life currently. I know I want to move, I don’t know where. I know I want to do something else for work, work for myself even, but can’t quite pull the trigger because money is scarce. 

Are there times in your life where you’re completely abstinent, though not really through your voluntary request? I almost feel as if my mind has too much to process and consider, to consider sex (or the effort of getting there), though the idea is very appealing. Do I just have to suck it up and stay dry for half a year until I should be able to have my shit figured out? 

What’s the word? Emotionally unavailable? That’s probably the only way I could describe what it seems I’m going through. But it seems to be effecting even my bare attempts at a casual relationship. 

Like I just blew a good opportunity to take this very good looking and attractive character out. She was interested, then my mediocracy turned her off, or something. In person? Great. Sending texts from home to set up a first date, where I’m in my head a lot and constantly plotting? Go look somewhere else. It just feels like I can’t resonate or display my personality, or showcase how good of a time we’d have, through a few brief Snapchats or first texts. Maybe I’m just not interesting enough, or have much to make that interest speak for itself? 

Phew, this one was brutal. I’m not discouraged nor should you feel bad, really, I’m confident in my ability to attract women (irl at least), I guess the problem really is through the different mediums of communication, besides phone calls or video stuff.

(Sorry its a long read because it is sort of a vent as well as me trying to give enough context as objectively possible)


Basically me and a girl have been talking for almost 3 months (met like 3 times irl got along real well but the rest is webcam chat). I can tell she is old fashioned in her approach to dating because she mentioned about taking things slow to see if things work and that she appreciated that i wasnt trying to just get into her pants. The lack of seeing eachother irl is due to our distance from each other as well as being extremely busy with our internships and school. This is technically our first prolonged relationship (shes never had a bf and I only had a couple short relationships) but we were taking it slow without the labels to really get to know eachother and plus due to covid. But we had a talk during our date about how things are going with us and basically she said she sees me more as a friend the way things are going. I responded with that i felt like there was alot of pressure with grad school and work rn and it was hard for me to put in work in a relationship and be myself. We did have a talk about dating related stuff and thinking about if we were in-person learning instead of zoom we'd be hanging out irl much more. I walked her to her car and we hugged and left after that. But looking back we were both generally low energy in that she was less touchy more awkward and and i was a little less enthusiastic and more awkward / monotone (from tiredness).


We talked on the phone later after we got home from our meetup and I basically told her how I felt which is that I needed to focus on school but I was open to trying again once we are done graduating in a month because it has been hard newly dating during our crunch time. But she said honestly as of right now its gonna be no and this is something she cant really give an answer to on the spot but she will really reflect and think about it. But she said she appreciated that i was courageous enough to share my thoughts. She apologized for sounding awkward and her tone and I did too because we are not used to having these types of conversations and said our goodbyes. Now flashforward to now, i feel like shit.


I feel really awkward sharing my feelings like that and I feel really bad if i came off as pushy or selfish due to it. I do value her enough to remain friends and I know that i am truly ok being just friends (but Im worried that i didnt give off that vibe talking to her)

At first, I want to say that I always thought that it's an absolute good value for a person to go beyond the physical aspect. 

However, it happens to me sometimes that when I am dating a girl that I don't think it's the best of the beauty, I feel like that I don't want the other people to know that I am dating her. It's not that I treat her bad, I treat her good when we are alone but try to avoid to meet other people. The fact is, **I think and judge more than enjoying**.  It's a fucking mental trap. Because it's much about thinking of the other people opinion, and not enjoying something.

Just as an example, I was dating a girl which I didn't find her super beautiful (but neither she was ugly), but when we were doing sex it was always GREAT. There was like a good connection between us during sex. However, I feeling a bit not comfortable to meet other friends when I was with her, and prefer to spend time only with her, and not with her + other people.

Of course, with that girl that I am speaking about, there was connection only during sex, outside sex we didn't have so many common interest, so I didn't wanted a serious relationship with her. But maybe, at least go together to a party with her saying proudly to my friends, that is the girl I am dating, that would have been good.

Don't judge me negatively for that, I think it's a kind of insecurity from my side that I just shift to the other person.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,750710,public,self,Accepting physical imperfections in a girl,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n3fwz2/accepting_physical_imperfections_in_a_girl/,all_ads,6,,,dating,

I don’t know necessarily what it is but like I always had attention from girls and stuff, but was always scared of making a move and I was too shy, and didn’t believe in myself enough. 

Before the pandemic I had been going out more and back then I was surprised when girls would approach me and tell me I was cute or talk to me. I was more awkward pre pandemic and I’d like to think I’ve found myself more now, but my BIGGEST progress came from having attractive female friends. Also pre pandemic the most I had done was make out with a girl.

But having like close attractive female friends made me a lot more comfortable around girls snd it also made me realize how imperfect girls are in a way. These things give me more confidence and I would take out my friend that’s a girl a lot so I’ve become comfortable like on dates now. They’ve also given me compliments but I think it helped that I stopped putting girls on a pedestal, and I now feel like girls are the lucky that they get to spend time with me lol.

Anyways, a literal measure of this was that I went out with a girl I had gone on one date a year ago, and a year later somehow things worked out and we saw each other for 3-4 months. I was pretty sad about the break up but it made me realize that I had grown as a person since we worked out this time around. And I lost my virginity with this girl bc she made me feel desired and it made me realize my worth in a way. Most importantly it made me feel like comfortable expressing my sexual desires and I felt more comfortable with making moves. I felt more confident and at least that I got some experience and I felt more content knowing I finally lost my virginity as a junior in college.

And after she broke things off the next week I went out and had two girls grind on me, and even though one of them told me she just wanted to dance and didn’t want to date, it felt so normal and I felt like I deserved to have a girl rub her butt on my dick. Like before I would be surprised but somehow I wasn’t surprised and now I have the mindset that Im dare I say attractive.

Then the next week I went out with a girl I had asked out a month ago, but had the date one month later bc at the time I didn’t want to see two people at once. We have the date, it goes decently and I didn’t even intend to make a move, but she asked me if I wanted to come in, she wanted to drink snd watch a movie, then we fucked. Granted idk if I’m going to see her it’s mind blowing that this random girl who I had just met sucked my dick and felt so attracted to me that she wanted to fuck on the first date.

Kinda made a joke about him hiding a peg leg.  He waxed poetic about how it's better to get to know someone on the phone instead of in person because - and I quote - the physical can be a distraction.  He said we can learn someone's true personality without ever seeing them. Questionable, but since he is quite engaging otherwise I decided to let it ride and to give him another week.

On Friday I had a work assignment in his area and I asked if he wanted to meet up. He said something along the lines of you probably wouldn't want to come to my house, and I have to be home all day so let's make plans for another time.  I decided to call his bluff told him I didn't mind at all and I'd be there in 20 mins.

For starters, he lied about his height. And just for the record I don't care about his height. However, I do care that he lied about being 6ft when he is so obviously not. Makes me wonder what else he is not being upfront about. His living conditions were surprising as well. We talked on the porch but from what I could see inside he is not doing well financially, and apparently hasn't for a while.

On the drive home I kept thinking about how many times he called to ask me what I'm cooking. I've been on a green smoothie program since I met him so I've not been cooking regular food.  Now that I've seen how he lives Im wondering if he was trying to ask for food??

my bf (34) and I (30) are ""arguing"" over a question, whether what I said is an ultimatum or not.

We are in a ldr, he's in the british army, I live in Germany. Due to the nature if our relationship (2 years so far) I decided that I'll not move with our son to England and give up my life here for him.

The plan was, that I move there with our baby for a year and he signs out of the army this September, so we can move next summer to Germany completely. 

It's not the first time he doesn't stick to his word. In fact, I was supposed to finish my degree now, but can't because he let me down and can't take his sabbatical year.

Now I feel very cautious about the fact to quit my job first in the hope he sticks to his word this time and actually signs out. If he doesn't, I'll have lost my job and can go back to Germany and apply for welfare. 

So I told him I'll only come to England if he signs out if the army first before I quit my job and until this hasn't happened, I'll stay in Germany with our baby. I told him he can sign out by either May or I'll prolong my contract at my work place.

He says, I'm giving him an ultimatum. I can kinda see why, but then again...correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the purpose of an ultimatum to force someone to do something or they'll get a bad consequence?
I just want to see that he is serious this time and told him, if he really doesn't want to sign out, we should just break up. I just don't wanna be the idiot again who gets kicked in the bum for trusting him.

What do you guys think? Am I indeed giving an ultimatum? And if so, how can I phrase it differently so it's not one, because an ultimatum is not my intention.

I'm pretty awkard around girls in the beginning but when i know people I'm alright. Now on to the story. About a year ago I saw a beautiful girl that i met through my sister. I glanced at her a couple of times and talked to her for like half a minute. I was interested in her. fast forward a week and i tell my sister that i liked that girl and asked some more information about her. My sister then informed me that 'said girl' just got a boyfriend. So I was pretty sad afterwards but I got over it eventually. Now almost a year later my friends urge me to make a dating profile. I do this and don't take it seriously. my first match is with you guessed it 'that gorgeous girl'. apparently she had just broken up with her boyfriend a few weeks prior.  I message her and we exchanged a few messages until she stopped replying. Because she also made the dating profile as a joke . My sister saw her in the following days and 'said girl' tells my sister about the dating match we had. So she sees it as a kind of joke. She hasn't replied my messages yet on the dating app. I already followed her on instagram months prior to this so I could always send her a message there. I really want to get to know her and I don't want to come off as a creep. Like I'm forcing messages down her throat. How do I get her out on a date and be in contact with her without coming off as a creep or desperate? I don't want to make it awkard for my sister either because she still sees her every couple of weeks or months. I can't let this girl go she keeps haunting me please advise me gods of reddit.,True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,750804,public,self,I need serious dating help please read my story.

I’ll start with a quote:

&gt;The search for happiness is one of the chief sources of happiness

In this post, I use the word ‘content’ rather than happy. Happiness (including happiness from relationships) is associated with venturing out, seeking, finding. Contentment is sitting down and appreciating what you already have.

The value many people place in a relationship is severely skewed and misplaced. I suspect a lot of this thinking can be traced back to the flawed ideal of the soulmate. That is, people consider themselves to be one-half of a whole person frantically searching for a missing part rather than recognizing their inherent worth.

The destructive nature of this thinking can be attributed to:

1. Desperation and lack of confidence. The most obvious downside. Other people value people who value themselves, and people who act desperate have less success and 
2. Emotional burdens. If you consider a relationship a life-force like blood to a vampire then your partner ends up bearing the emotional burden. A partner who has a well-rounded and fulfilling life will likely grow to resent a partner who requires nonstop emotional placation.
3. Downward spiral of self-worth. Once a person has firmly anchored themselves to a particular person via a relationship then their independent self-worth can become entirely subsumed. If they break up, their sense of personhood goes with it and they won’t be able to fully recover it for a long time (if at all). 
4. Poor decision making. Salesmen and marketers use artificial time constraints to impair our decision making abilities. It’s no different here; if you are convinced by societal norms, fears of biological clocks, and/or family pressures that you need to be married by X age or X date then you’re going to end up choosing whatever is in front of you rather than the best option.

———

Normally it’s pretty tough to impose this introspection on yourself and stop thinking about the possibility of relationships, so quarantining was a perfect salve for me. I think most people would realize with enough alone time that they do enjoy their own company, which will increase their sense of self-worth and let them see clearly about which romantic prospects are worthwhile and which ones are just sought out of loneliness

Ultimately, the ideal state of mind for a perfectly contented person is one that is appreciative of a relationship and see its value as one aspect of a multi-faceted and fulfilling life as a whole, not as the be all end all of living.

If you’re not content with yourself as a single person you won’t be content with yourself in a relationship, so take some quality time to enjoy your own company for a change.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,750833,public,self,COVID taught me to value not being in a relationship,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n3hb7u/covid_taught_me_to_value_not_being_in_a/,all_ads,6,,,dating,

Anyway, she seemed like she had a good time and even said ‘Thanks so much, we’ll do something else, I’ll be around all summer!’ before she got out of the car when I dropped her off. The kicker is, her close friend told me yesterday that between her and I, this girl told her that I was talking about people and things she didn’t know about (allegedly) and that she got bored. Now, I really don’t remember doing this, at least if I did, it had to have been short lived and was not the whole time.
