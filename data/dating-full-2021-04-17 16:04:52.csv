Some men like to think women are to just do whatever they say, but that’s not the case. The Bible also tells men to love their wives and to provide for them. A wife who submits is a wife who listens, supports, motivates, etc. it’s a partnership where both equally give and take. And traditional woman?

I've got to be honest, it hurts. I'll miss this person, they were really cool. I feel sad and a bit gutted. There is something about letting yourself be vulnerable sexually and emotionally with someone only to have it end.   


We weren't together for long and never committed beyond dating. So I really am not really torn up. But it definitely doesn't feel good. I think the reason it hurts is what I mentioned above. Just having had opened up sexually and emotionally with someone - to invest any sort of time in someone - to grow sort of fond of someone.     


But I'm not here to have a pity party, I actually wanted to say that this experience has been a bit inspiring.   


I think I'll take this time for the future to myself now. Previous to this I had been in nothing but long-term relationships. I've been in relationships for 7 years straight. One abusive one for 4 years, the next a stable one with a guy who wasn't for me for 3 years. I had been 4 months single when I started to go on dates with the guy I'm talking about above. I never considered not being open to love. I sort of always embraced someone I thought seemed really interesting.   


What's been so inspiring to me is that now that I'm single again... I feel free? I never considered not putting myself out there to date, but I don't want to put myself out there for the time being. It always seemed like: I believe in love, I'd love to be in love one day so of course I'll continue to put myself out there and remain open to love and see what happens.      


But for the first time since I became an adult, I think I'll not date. I think I'll do some other things. I think I'll enjoy more the love from my family, from my friends, from my work. Maybe one day I'll be ready again to put my heart out there. But I think it's time I give my heart a rest. It's been open to the world for so long, and I think I want to just tuck it in for a bit and let it be with itself.   


It's so remarkable, I've never felt this sense of resolve and peace. I never knew a version of myself like this before. I feel free to just let my heart be.

&amp;#x200B;

just want to know some opinions on my current situation. So I (M23) have met a girl (M24) while running and we chatted a bit and exchanged numbers. After a bit of texting I met her for a date and it went really good (ended with cuddling and making out).

The thing is since then I asked/hinted a few times for further meetups but she was always kinda busy (she is basically meeting friends every day of the week, no joke). It's not a lie, she often sends me pictures or short videos when they hang out and something funny happens etc. So yeah she is actually quite a busy person I guess. 

So I don't wanna be a drama queen or anything but I kinda get tired of asking at this point since she never seems to have time. In my opinion if someone has interest they make some time to meet up right? On the other hand she is still texting and sending pictures/videos, and we also had some phone calls which went on quite long. When we talk we get along really really well since we are very similar in our beliefs and opinions.

So I don't really know what to do from here on. Should I just leave it be and wait for her to suggest meeting up? Or should I talk to her about it? 

I dont wanna make drama, especially for someone she just met twice and had one date with. I kinda understand that long term friends have priority on her schedule and I think both people should have fun (especially at the start of getting to know each other) so I dont wanna be like pointing at her for doing things wrong. I kinda think if she really wanted to meet up again she would give at least an opportunity or anything like that....

English isn't my first language 😁

I don't know if that is the place but I am gonna try here. I've tried to get advices from several other sub Reddit but I was just down voted at best. 

Here is the thing. Two of my closest friends : 

 C - F29 single AT LEAST since I know her 2014 - not even a flirt, a kiss or something. I am pretty sure she has always been single. Never talked about a guy in her life. 

A - F40 and last time she did something with a guy was when she was 20. 

What they have in common is they are BOTH great girls, interesting, funny, good job, a lot of qualities I won't have enough space to describe here but they both suffer from their loneliness. 

I think they are having a hard time meeting someone because of their physical appearance. 

C has huge eyebrows, her teeth and skin are damaged, her face is long (she has a huge chin and a huge head) ... People say she looks like a man with a wig. First time I saw her I found her face weird but I got used to it and find her average. But everytime we like post a picture with each other, I got like 2/3 private messages asking me who she is and why she's got that face... 

A has hair face. A lot. Same thing, I love her so much I just don't really see that but people tell me they can only see that cause it's so obvious. She also has weight on and tend to wear little shirt and we see her fat from her belly falling. She also dresses like a man and even when eating, she eats like a man and like she hasn't eat since years. I can say she lacks of feminity. 

A lot of people tell me the first one is ugly and has a weird face, the second on has a lot of hair face and acts and dress like a man. 

They don't know this might be the issue. Don't tell me ""I am pretty sure they know"" Cause they don't. They say they know they don't look super hot but feel pretty average which should be enough. 

Why is that my issue? They complain about it all-the-time to me. When I say everytime, it's in every conversation telling me they feel lonely and they don't know what's the issue and being alone is hard and life is unfair cause other stupid ugly girls find guys... 

I mean it is a 24h convo we have. Depressed conversation 24/7.

At first I was like ""keep on dating you'll find one"" But for example, last month, 3/4 guys from dating app ghosted C after seeing her for the first time. 

Remember, A is single since 20 years. Staying herself doesn't work. Last time she had attention from someone was a few year ago by a woman.  

I am convinced they could meet someone if they improve some stuff.

We've been dating since highschool. We got together randomly and have been together ever since. But before that i had never had sex with a woman, just other dating experience. Now that time has passed, im a much different more confident, caring and loving person than i was in HS. Total husband material. I would never cheat on her as i know how that feels. 

Honestly i just dont know what to do. Its like my total enjoyment in life is capped at like 50%  i feel crushed almost, even though this woman is my best friend.

i love this woman, and will love this woman to the grave, as i do with all of my friends ( i only keep a couple because i like genuine relationships) but i really dont know how to keep this at bay anymore.

For the record I know myself to not pick up on cues or over read things or not knowing boundaries hence I'm always very careful when speaking around new people and especially on apps.
Which leads to me not sure of what to talk about or how to get a conversation flowing.

My conversations seems to jump all over the place more often than not and I'm pretty sure that's a bad thing. Also girls don't really start the conversations so I'm like do I keep trying or is that a subtle not interested?

In short I can get through the door, but can't figure out how to not get kicked out or ignored.

I lost my boyfriend unexpectedly almost two years ago now. I thought we were it. Grief, I continue to learn, is extremely complex and it’s difficult to really put into words all that I’m feeling now. I felt like I lost everything but am now coming to terms with the hard truth that while there was a lot of love between us, that was, in fact, not it for me. There’s so much love out in the world and I know I am not only deserving of that but I’m capable of giving so much love too. I know my late boyfriend supports me in that.

5 months ago, a younger guy asked me out. He’s 21. I’m 26. This was my first date since my bf’s passing. I couldn’t even bring myself to call it a date until just now. He didn’t know about my history. He tried to hold my hand and I couldn’t help but pull away so at the end of the night I told him. He was so sweet and kind. I expressed that I wasn’t ready and essentially, in so many words that what I needed was “love” without expectations because I truly have to take it one day at a time and take care of myself. He said he wanted to keep seeing me, not because he expected or wanted anything but because he enjoyed my company.  He gave me space but always made an effort to continue to build a relationship/bond with me which I appreciated but I pushed him away. I thought what he said meant I had time. I’m sure I took it for granted but it’s not that I expected him to wait for me out of arrogance, I really just needed time. I’m hurt and I’m terrified and I’m in a place where I’m redefining my life and what’s important to me. Being that this was the first date I’d gone on, I didn’t want to “waste” him and potentially move too fast without being ready, to then inevitably hurt and lose him. So I put up a wall. Then a friend of his came to me and said, he really likes you and speaks very highly of you, don’t hurt my friend. And I put up 10 more walls. I felt like I couldn’t be myself or be comfortable with him because he would fall for me and I’d hurt him just because I wasn’t ready. So I got a little awkward, flirting became difficult. I didn’t want him or anyone to think I was teasing him or playing games.

My grief had been especially difficult the last couple months so I’ve been looking for clarity, I last hung out with him three weeks ago and have gone from there’s no spark to realizing I was never open in the first place and I didn’t even give him or myself a chance. I had an awakening. It took me those three weeks to work through that and build up enough courage and ask him to hangout this weekend. Then he said, he couldn’t. He was sorry. He met someone and that’s why he had been distant with me lately. Ouch. I told him I was sorry I had been distant all along and thanked him for being so kind to me. He said thank you for being so genuine and he hoped I’d have a great night. I couldn’t help but drag it out and said, for what it’s worth I wish I could have been more open sooner! And that I would see him around. I didn’t expect him to text back but then he said, 
“Well you told me how you felt and what you had going on so I didn't want to push you. I like you enough as a friend so I didn't want to stop hanging out with you just because you didn't want a relationship. I wish you the best and I’ll see you at work.” Maybe he wanted to drag it out too on some level? Why else would he bother. I don’t know. I didn’t reply. Figured I should leave it. If I texted again after he said bye twice it’d be weird. Lol. We were never intimate in any way, and I was guarded and not completely myself the entire time. This isn’t, he met someone and now I’m jealous and want what I can’t have. When I finally reached out, I was ready to really explore with him. He’s a great guy. He deserves a chance and I deserve it too. 

The permanence of “I met someone” makes this feel urgent. I know how this sounds but as I continue to think about this I don’t want to just leave it or give him up without giving it a real honest shot. What do I do? Do I reach out again? How do I play this? Do I really just let it go??? I say play...I am not playing games...I just mean, how do move forward, with as much grace as possible.

It feels desperate. Is it though? From where I stand life is just so beautiful and precious that I never want to miss out or hold back from anything ever. But I understand not everyone feels that same sense of urgency in vulnerability. I don’t know that anything would come of us giving it a shot and I wouldn’t want to ruin anything he potentially has going for him. But I feel I also can’t let that dictate how I behave and what I want to pursue. I already let that kind of “what if” thinking get in the way when his friend spoke to me.

One idea I have is to call or text him again, last time, or wait to see him in person, and say something like, hey I want to ask again if you’ll go out with me. Changing verbiage from hanging out to go out seems important. He made every single move before, shouldn’t I at least make more than just one? Is that too straightforward or not playful/flirty enough? Again I don’t want to make it seem like I’m playing games but I do want to be smart about this and be as charming as I am honest. 

Its difficult. It’s confusing. There’s so much to consider. I tried to give you as many angles as possible. I hope I presented myself and the situation well. I would really appreciate your feedback. Thank you &lt;3

Hey everyone!
I’m stuck and I need to take a decision.


So I had a penpal in 2019 and we talked for a month or so and then lost contact. I contacted him again in 2020 October and we had nice conversations. We both started liking each other and things escalated, recently in March he said the love word but in April told me couldn’t do the distance and needed someone to have physical contact with.
We were never in a relationship but acted like a couple.


We were about to meet in 1.5 yrs but I ended it cuz he wanted me to be friends with him and I couldn’t do that because of my feelings for him.


But the question is after all that when I go to the country he lives in, should I meet him?

A little background about me. I am kind of a late bloomer, I didn't kiss a girl until I was 18 and I didn't lose my virginity until this year. I am not really ""defeated"", I think I have quite a bit going for me. Not the tallest guy (I'm 5'11) but I am described as good looking, I'm in shape, and I have hobbies that make me interesting I guess. I've been playing piano since I was 5 and I've been boxing since last year. I have some general social anxiety but I'm very kind and get along with people quite well.

Last year in October I dealt with a girl from Hinge that I caught feelings for. Looking back, she did say it pretty clear that she was not rushing for a relationship because she was busy, and she showed mostly that she was interested in me sexually. We met up twice within a week but facetimed a lot, so I grew to really like her. The second date I messed up because I was at her dorm and while we made out, she hinted through our text that it was over because I didn't go all the way with her. I also messed up because after the dorm, we facetimed and I brought up exclusivity. Soooo I learned to slow my roll in the future haha.

I had a girlfriend after this experience, and I had NO paranoia/low confidence whatsoever because this girl was really about it. She was straight up about wanting a relationship, no BS and she made it extremely clear that she only wanted to be with me. Unfortunately it couldn't work out and I broke up with her. I feel like my problem was attraction. I was attracted to her, but not like how I was with the previous girl. 

After a few months, I got back on the dating apps again. Last month I matched this girl, and I know for a fact I am very attracted to her. We facetimed, and then had a date and it went really well. Then we had another date the following week. During this time though, I would always think that she would either flake or ghost me for some reason. I would just feel terrible until she texted me or we met up. We were supposed to meet this Thursday, but she picked up an extra shift and we're seeing each other this Wednesday. So now it's gonna be like 2 weeks since we've last seen each other. We don't really text or facetime that much, but yesterday we facetimed for a bit and it was nice. Maybe it doesn't help that this girl, and the girl in october have very similar names, but I just be creating a web of anxiety thoughts and it just ruins me. I learned to keep my cool with this girl so obviously I don't tell her my problems or ask for exclusivity, etc. But I don't know. That time in October really messed me up and I don't know what to do about it.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,720814,public,self,How to get over my paranoia from a bad experience,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/msz1gy/how_to_get_over_my_paranoia_from_a_bad_experience/,all_ads,6,

She owns her own house and rents out each room to a friend. She told me early on (before we met) that one of her housemates is a guy that she had a thing with months before (implied that they did stuff with) but realized that they were better off as friends and she ended up renting the room to the guy. 

Early on it didn't really bother me that much, but as we developed deeper feelings for each other, it's become somewhat of an impasse on my part and I can't tell if I'm in the right or wrong. Some of the things that concerned/continue to concern me:

\-when I did a group gathering thing with her and her housemates, the dynamic between her and the guy was super comfy;

\-despite her other housemates (all being girls) not wanting him there, she constantly says she likes him there since he's helpful around the house;

\-the guy roommate uses her bathroom, since she doesn't want to make her girl roommates share a bathroom with him; 

\-the guy has a pet rabbit he was a allergic to and kept it in her room, up until fairly recently (to be honest, when I began seeing her).

Truth be told, I could care less if they had a thing before. I have a couple of ex's who are friends that I talk to every now and then. I've been in open relationships and more monogamous/traditional ones. I'm cool with most things as long as everybody is on the same page. But I do know she wanted exclusiveness early on (mainly due to COVID) and I agreed. A couple of months later I'm wondering if I made a mistake. 

Part of me is happy she a). told me early on when I asked her about him before we met and she told me everything instead of lying or being vague(which an ex did do in a similar situation), and b). even tried to help me become part of her group of friends (her housemates). I'm also happy the guy housemate has a GF and she's always there as well when he is (or seems to be).

So I don't know what to make of it or how to feel, so I suppose I'm seeking advice from people who have been in similar situations. And if you just say dump her or abort, can you please explain why?

I’m not really looking for advice. I just want to share my frustrations and see if anyone can relate.

For one, I primarily use dating apps which I heard is not the best place to find love. During most of my college years I was too insecure to date. I lost weight and got more confident my last few years of school but then covid hit a few months after I made my dating profile.

I am also not into casual sex. I have average looks and a bit of a curvy body so I get matches but things turn sexual so quick and it turns me off to most guys. Sometimes I’ll be up front about how I don’t wanna hook up and I’ll get ghosted. Or I’ll go on a good first date but he’ll invite me over to his home and it seems like sex is insinuating and I end up just letting him go. I’m open to making out on a second date but I want to get to know a person first before having sex. 

I am also starting to believe I have “high standards.” I’m not even really asking for much though. I’m interested in guys who have a college degree, a job, and who is taller than me (I’m only 5”6). Looks are important too but I don’t really go for guys who are stereotypically attractive anyway. 

I’ve had a few situationships where I thought it would get serious but one ended because I didn’t want to have sex yet (after just a few weeks btw) and the other one ended because he was apparently too busy. I’ve also gotten catfished a few times where the guys were way shorter than their profiles said. We were pretty much the same height which turned me off.

He was being very complimentary which I enjoyed at first but coming up on day 3 it was getting rather annoying and just too much for me, so I casually told him it felt like things were rapidly heading toward relationship town and that we should slow things down. 

He freaked the fuck out like he was crying and upset and he called me like damn this suuuuccckks and all this shit and it was just odd to me. He acted as though I was breaking up with him or something even though we hadn’t even been dating and it seemed like we’d been together for years based on his reaction. He was at work at that point so he had to call me back later. 

When he called me back later I told him I think we should stop talking/seeing each other based on the way he reacted earlier and he continued to freak out and told me I was being kind of shitty for telling him I wanted to stop talking to him after 3 days and that I should be considerate of the fact that he’s been through traumatic things and what not. He started going off about his passions and random things after that and was just rambling for like 30 mins straight and totally skewed off the main topic and it was just the most bizarre phone call I’d ever had!!

So, I'll make it short. The more I (25M) watch content to understand how all the dating stuff work, the more I am confident in my newly acquired knowledge (which I took way too long to understand but that's another question). I already made some posts and comments here where about everyone agreed with me (except one person that was completely out of topic).

Anyway, the main trouble I have right now is that I meet no one. Indeed, I have basically no need to go outside most of the time, which is I hope a thing only for this year. And when I go out for a daily 1 hour walk when it's allowed freely, I meet no one in my small city. Also, we have where I live some limitations in what we can do, where we can go, due to lockdowns and all. Plus, I rarely can go to other cities, as it can be a bit expensive. I sometimes do because I have stuff to do there or bought a 1-week pass so I use it on days where I have nothing programmed.

I would like to avoid dating apps, but mind less other digital stuff. I thought about Discord servers for example but I can't find interesting ones in my language. I'd prefer to meet IRL but I have no idea where to look for at the moment, basically what to do outside. I am on Interpals too but the site is basically dead so...

He’s 30 and I’m 28. It took me longer than I would have liked to end it but when I confronted him about Tinder he denied it. Said it wasn’t his profile - yeah ok *insert eye roll* and that he deleted it months ago. I had a gut instinct something more was going on so I checked out his Instagram followers.. what do I find? Girls, girls oh and you I guessed it, more girls. Flirty comments under his photos from literally 5-8 weeks ago, flirty comments on these girls profiles from him from literally 5-8 weeks ago. 

We spoke and it was very clear that he never saw anything more than fun with me. So I did it. I ended it. And you know I’m not even sad. Sure I’ll miss talking to him but I’ve seen him once in the last 10 weeks so I’ll survive.

Both sides complaining about the other being shallow, being jerks, etc.

Well here’s the problem. You know the common complaint that nice guys and girls finish last? Well that’s because the “nice” people are rarely ever the attractive ones. Yup, it has nothing to do with their personality, just the fact that a lot people, especially those younger than 25, place number one importance on looks. They want the hottest person they know to be super nice and submissive and loyal to them, but let’s be real, that’s not going to happen. In fact, if they’re super attractive, it’s better to assume that they are toxic and a jerk from the get-go. When someone gets all kinds of attention for free, they’re obviously going to take advantage of it. So sorry people, you can’t have the Vogue model and a nice person all in one. You’re gonna have to pick one. 

Staying on the topic of looks, people’s standards have gone through the roof on that. Both men and women only want the top 10% of the opposite sex, regardless of how attractive they are. It’s human nature to want someone attractive. But I think both genders are equally shallow, and they overestimate what an average person of the opposite gender truly looks like. 3 mediums are the cause of 99% of our unrealistic expectations: Hollywood, social media, and porn. Sorry ladies, the average guy isn’t 6 feet tall, doesn’t look like Chris Hemsworth or Michael B Jordan, doesn’t make 100k+ a year, and doesn’t have a shredded body. And sorry gentlemen, the average girl doesn’t have a completely flat stomach, with huge breasts and ass, and doesn’t have a face similar to Megan Fox or Madison Beer or Addison Rae.

As an Asian guy growing up I was sorta given a rough time for my appearance and had the luck of having my first significant relationship turn out to be mentally and physically abusive. Since then, I've sort of just kept to myself and done my own thing. I don't have many friends (which is something I'm happy about), and I had a few relationships, where is where the problem is - all of which eventually ended, a contributing factor being me eventually shutting myself off because I couldn't really wrap my head around the idea that they found me emotionally or physically attractive. Small things like never wanting to be in photos, not wanting to be part of their friend groups or social lives for fear of making them look bad, that sort of thing... it all just adds up in the end. I'm sure that they genuinely did find me attractive and want me, I just cannot put the two together when I look in the mirror. 

It's been something I've always just put to the back of my head but after a few years, I've now found myself in a situation where I'm talking to someone, something that started off purely as friends but feelings eventually grew from my side, without me knowing that they were also being reciprocated. Long story short having been so long since engaging in any sort of intimacy, I can feel the problem mentioned above cropping up again, especially because this beautiful Italian woman seems to find attractive all the things I absolutely abhor about my body or physique (my eyes, face, etc - she hasn't even seen the goods yet which I'm also terrified about). She says these things out of nowhere quite a bit when we speak and it always throws me off guard; I've deflected whenever she says something along those lines and I can feel my defensive mode kicking in again, which I hate. I've made some off-colour jokes or comments about my appearance in response in genuine humour (we both have quite dark senses of humour) but she seems to pick up on the fact that I struggle with my appearance and I don't quite know how to react/act. It scares me even more because we are at the point where she says that she loves me and can actually see something long term with me, despite nothing like that being on the cards for either of us to begin with; and its terrifying that I'd also be okay with/want that too. 

That said, it would be nice to be able to enjoy the feeling of wanting someone and being wanted by someone without a heavy heart.. constantly questioning it or whether I deserve it, especially with regards to something that I just can't change (my physique), and I'm wondering if anyone has any advice with how to deal with this?

It’s just dumb to have something exciting end in failure, suddenly meet another person, and then it still ends up bleh.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,721099,public,self,I went on two dates this week and both times were duds.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mt2ie4/i_went_on_two_dates_this_week_and_both_times_were/,all_ads,6,

He insisted he wanted to know me and wasn’t just there for sex.  It was about half an hour of him trying to comfort me and asking me if I wanted him to stay or go home- eventually he just went home  Bcos I was a not giving any clear response.  As soon as he left he texted me saying his that he would never hurt me &amp; that he was a bit offended that I’d think he would ever do anything without my consent. 

I asked for a second date and he sort of agreed but not exactly.  He’s quite hurt and offended &amp; I’m quite hurt that I ruined a perfectly good date just Bcos of past bad experiences. 

How does one even bounce back from this situation?

Today, after making a some offhanded joke making fun of myself, my date suggested that my joke was a reflection of me being nervous on our date. I was not nervous on our date, but even if he were right and if I had been nervous--calling it out isn't helpful. In fact, him suggesting that then made me nervous that I was reading as nervous and I began to second guess my personality, conversation, etc. I got out of my head and things did go smoothly beyond that, but it put a wrench in our game for a moment.

On a date with someone else, I commented that I wanted to freshen up my makeup, and that date asked me if I was THAT insecure. No, actually, I'm not THAT insecure. I just wanted to freshen up my makeup. I would do it for friends and I would do it if I were at work, but his comment created a weird dynamic between us. I'm not an asshole so I didn't reply, telling him that I actually wasn't interested in him at all so far and so there was no reason for me to feel insecure.

And, look, sometimes people say the wrong thing and that's ok. I'm just giving the advice that calling someone out on what you imagine is nerves or insecurity is just a turn off. Just say nice things OR, end the date if you're not interested.
