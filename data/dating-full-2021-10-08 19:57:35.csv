Here’s some observations from my perspective. Excuse my grammatical errors (and my goofy accent). 

Let’s be frank, dating can be hard enough to begin with. Add in cross-cultural factors and you got yourself one helluva challenge. But I’m here to tell you that it’s not impossible, and when a date/relationship goes right, it’s even sweeter knowing you had to go through all those extra hurdles. 

Coming from Scandinavia, dating can be much more straightforward due to our homogeneous society. By far and large, the “do’s and don’t”, and the expectations for what a date looks like is very similar. Here, there can be hundreds of different cultures found within the same city, and thus, besides being a decent human, the lines are more blurred when it comes to dating. 

One of many of my blunders I’ve committed include arranging a picnic at a cemetery (in North Europe cemeteries in the cities are often public parks and are places where people hang out, drink, etc). I’ve taken a display christmas tree after asking at Anthropologie because on the date I found out that the girl didn’t have a Christmas tree, and I thought they were for sale at that store. Or how about the one time I was filling forms out and I asked a stranger if she would let me use her rubber (later I learned it’s called an eraser). 

I am perhaps lucky in that I’m above average height, decent looking and well mannered, so when it comes to making mistakes, may be I get away with more then I should. But truthfully I am nothing more then an idiot who means well. Is there a point to this? No, not really. Just remember that for every time a date goes wrong or takes an unexpected turn, don’t take life too seriously. Laugh, and laugh some more.

I now take pride in my skin and it's one of my favorite qualities in myself and I get compliments because of it, but I have the occasional breakout under my lips that absolutely kill my self confidence and self esteem. And when I say breakout I mean one pimple, but I hate the P word because it's traumatizing to me, but wanted to illustrate it's one measly blemish for context. 

I occasional breakout other places on my face and I don't care, but this specific reoccurring blemish is just so unsightly. 

I'm sitting here wrapping up my Friday work day wanting to look for a date for tonight or tomorrow, but I am too embarrassed go on a first date with someone while having this thing on my face. 

I actually left the office early to finish my day working from home today. 60% of that decision was due to this. 

Is there a way to bring it up beforehand so I can put myself at ease knowing they are prepared? I think bringing it up in any way is a dead giveaway I don't have confidence and is a complete turn off. 

I know the healthy answer is for them to except me as I am and find the good qualities in me and I should be confident and not let one little (literally) thing ruin my night and there doesn't need to be any mention of it, but I'm not there yet mentally to overcome this.

Being a first timer, my jaws gave up on me after almost 7/8 minutes and I couldn’t get him to finish. Not sure how he lasted that long given that it was his first time receiving. But he did mention later that he was nervous so that might’ve been why. I went down on him again the same day but we had to cut it short due to other reasons so again, he didn’t finish. He began light heartedly making a joke out of this - “You couldn’t get me to come” and things similar to that. I didn’t find this very funny because being a beginner, it makes me feel as if I’m doing something wrong or I’m just really bad at giving blowjobs. What’s even worse is that he decided to make this joke in front of all our friends (we have the same friend group) and not only that, but he even allowed one of his friends to take part in this joke. I felt as if this wasn’t as deep as I was making out it to be so I laughed it off every time. 

Fast forward a while, I went down on him again and he guided me a little bit more. After a while he told me to switch to a handjob while kissing him. And he finally came. I was very happy thinking that maybe I was doing something right. Later I found out from one of my friends that he said, “Yeah she couldn’t make me come with a blowjob so she had to move on to a handjob.” First of all, I don’t know how I feel about him talking about our sex life to a group of people, specially in this way. Even after this day, he continues to make his little jokes. He even mentioned once that he thinks our sex might be bad (we’re both virgins).

Before he started making his jokes, I was actually very into giving blowjobs and wanted to do it often, regardless of him not finishing the first two times. But this whole situation is completely turning me off and I don’t feel like giving him head again.

Okay so,

I've met this girl around a year ago in a Discord server. For context, it was a sort of game community server, and we both (and still are) moderators there. We started chatting here and there. It really picked up around early December, and we chatted and called daily, often into late hours. At this point I think I already fell kind of in love with her. In march we added each other on snapchat. We didnt really used snapchat much in the beginning. Some snaps here and there, and mostly chats. After some time we got that yellow heart thingy. She sometimes sent me a cute snap, like really sometimes. And I think we now have that super BFF heart for around 2.5-3 months. However, recently I noticed that we lost a bit of contact. We still chat and call daily, but like it feels different. Especially because I think there is a ""new guy"" in the picture. I know, I sound really jealous. And when I send her a message it feels like she doesn't want to talk to me, or doesn't want a message from me. She answers really short and uninterested. This only happens in the evening when that ""new guy"" is online. But in the morning she always sends me a (voice)message. I just don't know what to do, or what to think. Am I paranoid and too jealous, or am I just overreacting.

And yes, I really would like to tell her how I feel about her. But I'm just afraid she doesn't feel the same way, and that it'll end/harm the friendship. Or that I am just too late, because of that ""new guy"".

But I have encountered a lot of abusive or controlling men when I have tried dating. Some I quickly cut off when I noticed it but other men were very nice at first and it was hard to see that they were abusive until the relationship became more serious. I have had to get a couple restraining orders. Stuff like this scares me, seeing the statistics on violence against women scares me. I discussed what the best strategy to weed out abusive men is, especially the ones who hide the red flags well. Some people think that it is bad to talk about any type of abusive relationships you have had in the past with your date at least for the first few months of dating. The idea behind this is because if your date happens to be an abuser he will look at you as an easy target and think you tolerate abusive men. However I also know others who have told me that it may be good to mention that you have encountered abusive men in your past, but make a point to mention that these men did not get away with it, you called the police etc. That way if your date happens to be an abusive person he will see you aren’t a weak target and you will not tolerate abuse. 

I know for me personally, I went on a couple dates with a guy and he asked me about my relationship history. I explained I had dated some normal guys but also guys that turned out to be abusive and I had to end the relationship and get the police involved and how I hope I never have to go through that again. The guy who had been interested in me, didn’t contact me after that. I had honestly answered his question, because I believe in being honest but I wondered about what happened there . My first instinct was that he was an abuser who didnt want to get in trouble and could see I wouldn’t tolerate abuse , why else would he stop talking to me? My second thought when I thought more about it was that some men seem to think that there are a whole lot of women making up false allegations against men, and men are afraid of it. I spoke to police and victim witness court advocates about the idea that women make stuff up about abuse from men, out or curiosity on the stats and I was told both times that it is extremely rare when this happens and usually doesn’t go far because usually you need evidence for convictions. I think the cases where this stuff happens are usually when women want a lot of money from a guy who has a lot of it, otherwise I guess I don’t see much of a point. And of course some of these cases are highly publicized. There really isn’t a point to make things like this up if you aren’t going to sue civilly as you need evidence for this stuff to be prosecuted in criminal court. However not everyone is educated on this stuff and people can have misconceptions. I would still like to know if I should be be discussing any of this at all with dates when they ask about previous relationships, or if there should be a time frame when it should be discussed .

She has never had any relationship before and I'm her first boyfriend, first kiss, pretty much first everything. She's very close to her parents and has introduced me to her parents. I've developed a great bond with her parents. In fact, her mom tells me ""She constantly talks about you and misses you when you're not around"" but my girlfriend doesn't say it to me directly.

However, apart from expressing the crush confession at start, my girlfriend can't express much. She says it's due to her never been in a relationship which I understand.

 It's been fun, I enjoy his company, and like him as a person. He's also attractive, and seems like he is a responsible adult. He has everything I look for in a potential partner overall. Problem is... Neither of us are ready for a serious, committed relationship. He just got out of a long term 6 year, and I've had my fair share of horrible relationships including but not limited to being cheated on, abused, and lied to.

We both like one another as people, openly, and have both expressed we aren't ready for a relationship. He also brings the distance factor up a bit in regards to that, while also letting me know he enjoys my company.


I don't have any need to have a sexual relationship with him nor anyone else, and am unsure if it would be better for me to be single and focus on myself in therapy, as I am working heavily on learning self-love.

I (23M) have started to realize that every girl I have dated, I haven’t truly loved. Whenever I have said the love word, looking back, I realize that it has always been forced out of me and I have never truly meant it. This realization has just made me upset. I enjoy relationships and companionship, but once a girl really starts to like me I just get carried away and go into a relationship just because the girl at the time is really into me. Don’t get me wrong, I like the person, but it just makes me upset having felt a feeling of ‘who am I kidding, I don’t actually love this girl’, while actively saying so to the girl.

&amp;#x200B;

I (20M) started a new job and I met this girl 25(F) and we don't work for the same company as Im a third party contractor at the place she works at.She is in HR and I have a position in Building Maintenance I make about 33 an hour for reference. But getting to the point I have talked with her alot in the time ive been there and she is so great we are very similar and have the same exact sense of humor. We are so similar that I sometimes complete her sentences and jokes without intending too and it just feels so easy and effortless to talk with her it feels as if ive known her for years.

Earlier this week I made up an excuse to go too her office and talk she said ""can I tell you something off the record"" and  we talked about how one of my Co-workers had actually came on to her and tried asking her out too which she replied ""IM A LESBIAN"". We laughed about it and continued to talk and bullshit for a while until she had to attend a meeting.

( I should add in here that its not just a one sided conversation as im always told I talk too much about pointless shit but when im talking too her she is often the one who talks just a little more and I enjoy listening to her)

Today I saw her again and we talked on and off for the day mostly just random bullshit and just joking around and learning about eachother.  I learned that she is not a strict 100% lesbian but she's Bi and that's why she prefers the term queer. However she leans more in favor of women. We talked alot about sex and our sex lives. This was odd too me as I've never had such an open conversation like this with a woman. in the same conversation we talked about how we had both smoked cigarettes and  had quit. she proudly showed me this app she has that tracks the amount of time since you've smoked. ""it was 13 days"" but there was another tracker about 50 days.

I had not seen the other tracker originally but I know of it because she ""said don't ask about the other one"" so naturally I ask and she says ""it's the amount of time since I've had sex"" and we both laugh about it and continue talking until we actually had to work again and we didn't  see each other for the rest of today.

This last conversation was when we also learned about eachothers ages and when I said I turn 21 in 2 months she jokingly said ""omg your a baby"" I asked how old she was she said 25 I replied ""its not even a huge difference"" and she again jokingly says ""yea but 25 in girl years"". this was also where she asked how much I make at the position I'm at and was impressed when I told her that was just starting rate and we talked about how she had gone to college and I trade school.

I had also learned she was moving to another state because she felt a bit impulsive and applied for the same position she had but somewhere else. I will admit I was a bit upset because I would be losing someone who is an amazing friend whom I  genuinely enjoy conversation with but I supported her and I teased her a bit on her choice of where to go and it did come up that she wont be there forever and will eventually come back.

I guess I'm just conflicted about this and you guys probably guessed but I'm attracted to this girl however its not the normal "" Shes hot I wana fuck her"" its more of a ""I enjoy conversation with her and she actually makes me laugh"". In fact she isn't even the type I would normally find attractive and actually has some traits I would normally find a turn off like not shaving her armpits. I always thought to myself that my preferences could never be changed but I do not know how but this girl is an exception to those preferences. I should add I do still think is attractive and I think she has a very cute face and wonderful eyes.

What do I do? I don't want to lose her as a friend by asking her out and being rejected and even if I don't completely lose her as a friend it would just make things awkward between us and I don't want that to happen.

After 2 years of successful therapy and figuring out how to take care of my own needs. Idk how to add in dating?
 
Feels like it takes a lot (or less?) For me to actually fall for someone.  It's rare.

I genuinely love other people, but in a platonic way mostly. People are awesome and I like getting to know them without pressure of having to date said person.
So it usually turns out I'll like them after they gave up or they smother me till I can't take it anymore. 

But I prefer not to speak to people on a daily basis unless I have a deep connection with them or I'm paid to do so.
I still crave that deep connection though :/ like with a best friend.  I state my boundaries as nicely as possible and newer people still think they are the exception already which ends up being a turn off. 

Maybe I'm just enjoying time with myself more and the genuine friends in my life. 

My guess is to continue with what I'm doing and the right human will come along.

I complain a lot when guys reject me after a good date- I'll say things like what is he looking for? We hit it off well, I'm decent looking, I am well educated, I'm a nice person- why would guys not stop and give things a chance.

But then when a guy is into me after a few dates, I start to feel like there are several options and perhaps I'll find someone I like even more. Someone more perfect.

When in reality between working full time and regular parenting things I only get about 4 kid free days a month!
I’ve even tried connecting with other single parents. They all seem to be looking for someone who doesn’t have kids! I’ve even had a guy say to me “sorry but I’m looking for a girl with no kids, I can’t handle anymore kid stress then I already have.”
I just don’t get it. Are single parents like a huge breaker that I wasn’t aware of? Like before meeting my child’s father I dated a man with kids and didn’t think twice about it!

Mind you he’s not my type at all but my friends were persistent because apparently he’s such a nice guy. Wrong! This man is so disrespectful. I had to text him bc he was so scared to text me then he ends up asking me out on a date. All through our texts he’s like let’s see if you can handle me, you can’t handle all this just talking a big game. So before our date even happens he asks me out for Friday and Saturday and I agree. Friday comes we go out and and it was cool. Let’s just say at the end of the date I was like he’s cool but he’s not my type. I went to house to use the bathroom and it smelt like straight up cat piss and he just seemed like a dirty person. These to me are all red flags but I love to ignore red flags bc my friends keep on insisting to go out with him bc he’s so nice. Saturday comes we go to the Mariners game with his friend the entire time I can’t read the vibe if he’s tryna talk to me or not. Let’s just say his friend ends up trying to flirt with me all night. At the end of the night I’m tipsy I go home. Turns out I left my ID and debit card with him. Instead of giving it to me the next day this man waits 6 days to then come and drop it off at my leasing office. Mind you he was ignoring me all week. I called him today bc this was just ridiculous and he finally answers and we agree to meet to get my things. When I say I feel so disrespected it’s an understatement. I’ve never had someone who was so turned off by me that they had to be so petty. All throughout this he was ignoring me when I was calling to get my things.

I (a man) do really well with women and have a lot of women in my life. I casually date a lot and have FWBs in several different cities. But I haven't really had strong feelings for anyone in years. Until recently. I took a weeklong trip with this one woman I'd been seeing for a while and she's just amazing. I feel so happy spending time around her. 

Unfortunately there seems to be a pretty massive discrepancy in our feelings... She seems content to continue hanging out with me occasionally, for now, but I don't think she is particularly enchanted with me and a relationship is not on the table. 

It's so, so disappointing. I know how full of myself this sounds, but I go through most of my life feeling like I could have just about any woman I want. It's not literally true of course, but I just feel like it's easy to get women. And now for the first time in years I actually have strong feelings for someone, and of course *she* is the one I can't have. 

I've got an active social life but I feel lonely all the time without her. It's so crazy to me to think how differently we must have perceived that week together. 

Not even sure where to go from here.

I’m attracted to him but it’s his personality I like the most. Everything else sort of just feels like it completely aligns too.

We’ve had a few hiccups but I was giving him the benefit of doubt. The last “hiccup” put me off because I was disappointed maybe I expected a bit too much from him because I felt some sort of connection. 

We were speaking non stop in constant contact. This stopped after he gave me an underwhelming response to a picture I sent him of a dress. Keep in mind he regularly sends body pics of him at the gym, I always compliment him. He ignored the ones I sent. 

I couldn’t bring myself around to responding to him since it bothered me a lot more than it should have. I haven’t even met him yet so I don’t want to have such a conversation. Too soon and too much pressure.

Right from the start he asked me out on a date for this Saturday. I haven’t spoken to him since Thursday and he’s tried to contact me. After his cold response I had no idea what to say to him if I’m being completely honest. 

Okay here’s where the guilt kicks in…

My friend set me up with a guy. She gave him my number and he called me after work. I already knew what he looked like and I did like what I saw. He gave me a proposition, I should let him pick me up and have a conversation. 

I went along with it and he took me to a bar with some live music and it was honestly lovely. I don’t understand why I feel so guilty and weird. I’m completely torn. 

Do I give the guy from today a chance? We have a friendly conversation and we had some chemistry. Or do I see them both? The first guy was on my mind a lot of the night. 

I feel like if I saw the first guy in person maybe it’d translate better. I could see myself in a relationship with him but this new guy is a risk.

Have not met in real life yet due to the geographical locations being really far apart. Though there may be times when I think that she is trying to shoot her shot. Not too sure if she is interested in meeting up because we are great friends or she wishes to develop the connection into a relationship. Here are a few pointers that I picked over the few years of conversations. Im 23 and she is 32 in 2021.

1. Suggesting staying at her place while visiting Seoul, at first was with rent. But now, for free

2. Suggested visiting numerous attractions of which I thought, that is way too many places (Amusement parks, picnics, Hiking). Basically it feels as though I might be travelling with her everyday during my trip to South Korea.

3. Suggested that if I were to visit Busan, she would allow me to stay at her younger brother's place. (Cus the younger cant refuse the older siblings). Not too sure about this one though, but it may be a possibility that her family knows me now, as the guy who sent in a box of snacks that one time.

4. Wants to treat me to meals, or cook for me. As a thank you for all the times that I had helped her out. Very generous and kind of her, but after hearing all the suggested places and food she wants to give a treat, it may be to the point that every meal is covered.

5. She mentioned that I helped her through tough times of which till now i cant deduce what that tough moment was. All I did and can do is to listen over a phone call to her rants and worries.

6. Basically me going to Korea feels like an almost complimentary trip.

7. On a phone call, she said 'I like you', to which i replied: 'Oh me too'. She said 'I like you' again to prompt me to say 'I like you too'

8. Said that I talk like people around her age, seeing us as equals. Interesting thing is that, probably in the first few months of this friendship, she mentioned that she wished that I was around her age. Moving forward to 1.5 years, she said that she sees me like a guy of her age (The way I talk, her perception of my maturity) and at 3 years she mentioned that age is just a number.

9. Sometimes tells me who hits on her or going for blind dates in the past. 

10. Overall, could be just friendly vibes, but none can be decided until the meeting in real life
