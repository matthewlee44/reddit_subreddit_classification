But I want to know if I can get with him but I need to somehow find out if he's actually bi. Now I think he likes me as a friend for sure, just idk anything more. He's always the first one to see my snapchat and insta story and he likes all my tiktoks but it takes him ages to text back (a few mins sometimes hours) and doesn't text much. 

I've been 'stalking' his socials to see if he has a gf or likes guys but so far its been inconclusive really. Fyi I have a lgbt flag in my bio so I think he knows I like guys.

This kinda has to do with alcohol. I met up with this girl and we went out for drinks, it went really well.

My thing is.. as most people, drinking takes me wayyyy out of my shell. I tend to make people laugh a lot more and feel way more at ease. The problem is, I decided to hang out with her once more for a speedy dinner date (like 2 ish hr date). I go from relatively introverted to  charismatic over the course of just a few shots.

I decided not to drink on this date, and I'm not gonna lie. I had almost no idea what to say to her, even if I had seen her 3 total times before. The conversation just wasn't flowing. It was nice and the date wasnt dead in the water, but I felt like I was honestly trying pretty hard to maintain the convo. I can't tell if maybe we don't have a connection and maybe it was just fueled by being a little lit. But as somebody who often drinks in social situations, I know I can't rely on this permanently, but idk what to do.

I will be as specific as I can this time. I will give as much detail as possible and try to make it as objective as possible but it is hard. Feel free to ask me any clarifying questions.

Me and my girlfriend have been in a relationship for over 3 years. She is my first girlfriend and although she had relationships before I am the first and only guy she had sex with. I love her dearly. Things aren't going great lately though. When we first started dating over three years ago thing were fine. We spent a lot of time together, we kissed in public, we talked a lot. She was pretty shy but overall it seemed to me that she felt comfortable with be and I felt very comfortable and relaxed with her. Being with her gave me peace of mind I never felt before.

Over the last year or so thing have gone sour. She started getting more and more annoyed with me over minor issues. We have very little to talk about and she does NOT like when I talk about stuff that interests me (politics, science, urbanism, languages etc). For the first two years she listened to me but now she is pretty direct that she doesn't want to hear me talking about these things. The only thing we can really talk about is the gossip from the university we both go to. She doesn't play videogames and she does not like me even mentioning them. I don't know what I could do together with her - the only past time we share is going to parks (any advice?).

I feel like she has changed a lot since we started dating. Particularly in the last year or so. (Do all girls do that? I really don't know - she is the first girlfriend I ever had so I have nothing to compare to.) She used to be quite meek and gentle. Now she has become very outgoing and boisterous to the point that I often find it disrespectful towards me. It is hard to describe what I mean, but, as an example, when we a going in a group of friends she now rarely walks by my side leaving me behind. She started swearing a lot which she didn't do before. In the past she didn't mind me kissing her in the metro or elsewhere in public, but now she is pretty clear against it.

She helped me a lot over the years we have been together. She helped me to get through coursework for which I am very grateful to her. Me asking her for help (even in superficial things like asking what the homework is) has been getting her more and more angry in the recent year. Am I expecting too much of her?

Another point of tension is out potential future life together whenever we try talking about it. On one hand she very clearly expects me to support her financially. Food, housing, everything she might need. I have no qualms with that - I support traditional gender roles. The issue is that she doesn't want to give anything in return. She doesn't want to take care of the kids. She doesn't like cooking despite being quite good at it (she cooked some tasty thing at the beginning of or relationship probably to impress me). She gets quite angry any time I suggest that I would expect her to at least make a superficial effort at taking care of our home once we start living together. She says that she likes her career (chemical engineer, like myself) and she wants to work full time saying quite directly that she believes that woman's money is only for her whereas man's money is for both. Again, I have no problem with such approach in theory, as long as the woman is willing to give something in return. I find her approach quite egoistic. She blatantly refuses to even consider the notion of moving to a different city let alone to a different country where I could potentially have much better career opportunities, even for a year or two.

I need some advice. I am not experienced at relationships. I do NOT want to break up with my girlfriend if I could help it for a variety of reasons. I truly love her. We have common friends. And the thought of trying to find a new girlfriend that I would love as much after 3 years of dating this one is daunting. I am not the sort of guy who can easily find a date. Am I doing something wrong? Am I misjudging her actions? Is our relationship salvageable?

TLDR. Me and my girlfriend have started having a lot of differences. I really don't want to have to break up with her if I could help it but I don't want to be stuck in an abusive relationship either. I used to be very relaxed and at peace with her but now any time I spend with her I feel like I am walking the knife's edge not to get her angry. I need advice on how to deal with it.

One girl who I was seeing for 3 months basically said that she didn’t want a serious relationship and cut things off with me, another girl we had sex on the first date but she didn’t want to see me again, and maybe I have yet to learn how to be more relationship material or idk. Is it bc I go for unavailable girls to begin with me, like I don’t know if it’s a me or them problem, and perhaps I’m choosing the wrong girls.

I’ll give like an example that describes my problem. The other night I went out with the sole intention of not trying to talk to any girls or flirt or anything bc I was tired of just causally flirting and wasting energy on girls. I forgot what happened exactly but this girl tapped me on the shoulder and said her friend wanted to tell me that I looked like this really weird Tik toker (not the cool hot kind lol). By that point I was beyond drunk and pretty incoherent so I don’t remember exactly what happened. 

All I remember is that we started talking, we found out where we were from and all that stuff, I remember we were talking snd joking about stuff, and I complimented her glasses and tried to flirt with her. I ended up asking for her Instagram, she gave it to me, and then I tried to dance with her but maybe I was too drunk and sloppy, bc she didn’t really seem with it. My friends were like pushing me to have her grind on me (that’s usually what happens in the club) and I tried but like I said she didn’t seem with it. 

I do remember just like being touchy, holding her hands, holding her shoulders, you sort of have basically touch cheeks to talk to the person,(it’s so loud) and looking back I might’ve been too drunk but I think I did everything in a way that seemed natural if that makes sense. And to end things, she said that she hadn’t had much to drink (that sort of affects things), I see her downstairs and for some reason she gives me her Snapchat so that she could send me a video she took.

Anyways, her drunk gay friend says we should kiss, I sort of push for it jokingly, she says I’m too drunk, I sort of play it off and go upstairs. Like 10 min later I don’t remember if she came back upstairs to get something or purposely to see me, but she says she’s leaving and we end up like doing one of those like Latin esque cheek bump thingsto say goodbye (it’s common in like Mexican culture). 

I was sort of too embarrassed to text her the next day (also she lives in another country) but I also wasn’t sure if she thought anything of me so I just never texted her.

We were friends before until we realised we had feelings for each other. He’s kind and funny and intelligent and we are compatible in every way and I’m really falling for him. I still live with my parents as I’ve just finished uni but he lives alone in a flat. I go over to his about once a week, however I’ve never stayed the night for various reasons. The area he lives in is very rough, and there’s ‘a few dodgy characters knocking about’ (his words). He lives on the ground floor of what is basically a studio flat. Now, I don’t care about how big or nice his place is or isn’t. What bothers me is that the whole place makes me feel very uneasy and nervous, and he’s on the ground floor right by the door which is not very secure. I always think I can hear people breaking in and it’s preventing me from staying the night. I hear all sorts of shouting in the night from his neighbours too.

I’m really conflicted on what to do. I really like him and have done for a while, he’s just in a bad situation where he can’t live with his parents and this is the only place he can afford. However, I feel really uneasy and quite frankly unsafe there,meaning I will probably never stay over. This is obviously a problem when starting a new relationship. I do not want to lose this guy because connections like this are so rare for me. 

I’m also about to move to a new town which is almost an hour away, so if I come to visit I will have to stay over really. And as I still live with my family I don’t feel comfortable bringing him back to my house.

I’m trying to approach this situation with caution, I don’t want to keep pestering her if she’s not interested, but I also don’t want to throw this chance away. Like I said, I’m really into her.

Basically, at the time I was 15 (im from the UK and the age of consent here is 16), I got into a relationship with this girl (she’s now my ex), one day she messaged me and asked if I wanted to “do it” with her when her parents were out, I said yes and a few hours later I headed to her house, however I was very nervous, I was just thinking all day about the possible outcomes of this situation, I was worried that wouldn’t be able to get hard, anyways I got to her house, chilled most of the afternoon and evening. She then asked me if I wanted to have sex after we finished watching our film, I obviously said yes. Once the film ended, she said she was very insecure of her body so she turned the lights off, I didn’t think much of it at first but then I realised what was going to happen (it was like 10 pm and it was pitch black outside so i couldn’t see anything, the room was completely in the dark), she then lays on her bed as she takes her clothes off and says “put it in”, there was 0 foreplay and I couldn’t see a thing therefore leading to me not being able to get hard; to make things worse, my mum said she was waiting outside for me. I’m not trying to blame her for me not being able to get an erection but could there have been any solution to this problem at the time? I did some research once I got home and discovered I potentially could have Porn Induced Erectile Dysfunction(PIED), back then I would masturbate and watch porn daily (i had been doing this for almost 4 years) so I reckon that played a massive part to that whole experience, 20 days ago I decided to start NoFap just in case I do have PIED and so far some of the benefits have been amazing.

In the second date it went well, but when I made a move to kiss her she  said she wasn't ready for it (after 3 months of really flirty texts and calls).

Fast forward to our third date, we had a really nice picnic planned, the vibe wasn't the same as the first two dates but just as we started clicking, she got a call and had to leave for a friend's emergency cutting our date very short. She then started texting very inconsistently and said she has a lot of emotional things going on. This all left me very disappointed and I called her to talk about all the mixed messages. She tried to justify her change in behavior by saying she had a lot of emotional issues atm with work and some other personal things. She eventually said she would like some space and we wished each other good luck.
I eventually went on a date with another girl I've been chatting with and it was nice, but I can't fully get the first girl out of my mind :( 
I think the fact that we connected so well over text and video and had an almost relationship makes it worse and makes me wonder if I should try reaching out again after sometime. I had really started liking this girl.

I'm a guy whose appearance is significantly affected by illness. Basically I look a lot older than I am due to going bald at 16 among other things.

Pretty much my entire 'dating' experience has involved either getting ignored on sight alone, or actively abused for how I look. I want to make it clear this has been the case regardless of context, what I say or do etc. For example I've gone through matchmaking services where someone else ""advertises"" you etc. with the same results. I've still got hope, but realistically it's very hard to overcome that initial impression / view formed that I'm not a dating option based on my appearance.

Occasionally, I will want to complain or vent about this treatment. Yet, every single time there will be someone who just can't empathise with the experience, who feels a need to blame my personality for my troubles.

Why do people feel the need to do this? It is unbelievably offensive and insulting to tell someone suffering from illness that they're a terrible person for complaining about their position. 

It should be completely unacceptable to try to invalidate my lived experience based on their limited understanding.

I get that there are many guys out there who may have personality problems to blame for a lack of success in dating - yet there are a few of us who genuinely experience nothing but hate based on looks alone. It's incredibly frustrating to be judged based on unchangeable physical characteristics, and even worse for that experience to be ignorantly dismissed and have your personality attacked.

Why is it so hard for people to try and understand before spouting their abuse?

I had three dates so far this year and they were all bad. The first girl wrote and talked like an angel but spend the entire date complaining about stuff and explained in detail why she hates her father's new girlfriend. The second date was great (i thought) but the girl ghosted me afterwards (well, it happens). And yesterday I had my third date but I had little to no chemistry with the girl and we spend most of the date in silence. 

On the positive side, I learned a lot about dating and people but on the other side, it feels real, really tiresome. The other thing is that it feels frustrating to think about putting all the effort and energy into getting to know the next girl and writing with her if I'm obviously cursed. 

Last year i had 5 dates and 3 of them were perfect and home runs, one time i got ghosted and the other girl was honest with me and told me that she doesn't like me.

Am I upset? Yes but I'm not going to cry, because the experience alone was amazing and filled me with joy and confidence.

Which is not exactly a lie. made me feel like a coward regardless.

Then again.... i don't think i could ever just throw myself at a person i just met so fast and think about marriage when you barely even know the person. it freaked me out cuz  often times you dont know how serious the other person is or if its hacked account or something messed up like that. it can also be a little nerve wracking when someone actually likes you. like do i deserve to be in a romantic relationship? a lot of self baggage that's probably reason why i haven't been in a relationship for almost a decade is general phobia and bad mental habits. I don't get freaked out as much in person usually. Its the internet. The not being able to see the other persons body language. meeting in person you can be down to earth and understand each others quirks but online its so easy to miscommunicate.

So there is one Walmart girl I really admire, but never got a chance to talk, until a week ago when I was at the store just a while before the closing time and she initiated a conversation herself, asking about if I live nearby, she has noticed me multiple times etc stuffs like that, but it didn't last long because other customers were on the line.

Oddly enough, after that day, I never saw her in the store! I've been going there every day but not a single sight of her. Even today, the time of day I saw her last week, I didn't see her either!

Possibilities say, probably that was her last day there and she's never coming back. But to be sure, ***I'm thinking, would it be decent to ask another employee about her whereabouts?***

On the contrary, there is a chance that this move might backfire, if she thinks, why this guy is stalking on me?

But I am tired of going to Walmart every day too as if I'm in a puzzle with no hint to the treasure box.

What do you suggest?

We got in a bit of an argument and I deleted the app. I told her I didn’t want to date anyone else anymore. Last night I saw that some guy texted her. I asked her about it and she said it was just one of her guy friends. Eventually after pushing a bit more I realized it was some guy she matched with on a dating app. I saw the convo and realized she was even responding to him while we were out together the previous night. I got really upset because she gave me a hard time about talking to other people, but she was doing the exact same thing. She then asked me if I slept with any of my dates right after we met. I wanted to be honest and I told her the truth that I slept with one girl but have since cut off all contact when I deleted the dating app, and my intention is to be exclusive. Now she’s pissed at me over that, even though I made it clear to her in the beginning it was very casual and I wanted to see other people. She begged me to stay together with her but I told her that I needed time alone. She then texted me an hour later saying we shouldn’t see each other anymore.

I've been on a few dates since then which went okay but were all just single dates where we both decided it wasn't right, and I had been really just comparing everyone to my ex anyway, which isn't fair.

She seemed awesome but I get so nervous about myself and having shit self esteem that I didn't expect much, but it all went so well! We had dinner, then went to a bar for a bit and back to my place to hang out. She spent the night and I drove her back this morning. Because we both have kids and other shit I can't see her again for two weeks but she confirmed she wanted to see me again before dropping her off.

So... I'm like absolutely gushing with affection for some reason and don't know how to handle it lol I don't want to be overwhelming, and I feel like I already am being that.

So bad that I actually just got a therapist appointment for the first time in my life. 

I just turned 23 on Thursday and it hit me like a ton of bricks - I am so lonely. I've only had 1 girlfriend and we dated for 2.5 years of college which makes me sick at times because while I really liked her (and would like to get back with her) it makes me think of all the potential girls I missed out on. 

Lately all of my friends have serious girlfriends or are even engaged. I don't have a single girl in my contacts that I consistently text. I'm not bad looking, I actually get called handsome a bit, but I broke my nose as a kid and I hate the way it looks so much that I always feel incredibly insecure and ugly. It's so bad that even if a girl shows interest in me while at a bar or whatever, all I can think about it how bad I look. I've never been able to approach girls either as I simply have no idea how. 

Anyway, I just want to meet some girls and get to know them. But I have no idea how. All me and my friends do is go out on Fridays or Saturdays to the same bar every time and I've never met any new girls in our 4 months going there. I'm an artist and incredibly into art/fashion/music and what-not, and my dream girl would be as well. Basically I'd love to meet girls like this but I have no idea how or where. 

I'm sure everyone will say ""go join this or go join that"" or whatever but I don't even know the first place to look to join ""communities"" or groups like that - and do single girls even join things like that anyway? 

Anyway really could just use some comfort in these times. I haven't felt this bad in years and I'm beginning to get very scared for my own personal future.

In today’s post, I will talk about my journey from  struggling with social anxiety to becoming the person I am today, a  social butterfly. I believe that becoming a social butterfly is important in relation to dating. A social butterfly is someone who is willing to take  social risks and who feels little to no social anxiety in social  settings. I wasn’t always a social butterfly. I used to be shy, full of  anxiety, and unable to express myself the way I wanted to. This was  especially difficult because I was an extrovert in nature. I had a lot  of energy and ideas that I wanted to express to my peers and to the  world, but my mental barriers stopped me from doing so. I was forced to  live the life of an introvert and this made me miserable and depressed.

When I was a kid, I was happy, confident, and I had a lot of  childhood friends. Everything changed when my family had to move cities  abruptly at the start of my first year of high school. This was about 7  years ago. 

Moving schools and cities was a very difficult process for me. I was  leaving behind all the friends I had grown up with, and I did not get a  chance to say a proper goodbye and to receive closure. This closure came  later, and it will be the subject of a future post. I tell you this  story to tell you that my high school years were very tough. I struggled  with depression, with acne, with gynecomastia, with OCD, with anxiety,  and with other issues. I was out of shape, and despite wanting to be  popular and have cool friends, I was lonely and felt rejected. The new  friends that I had made were not considered popular and I did not feel  comfortable associating myself with them. Things got better in my later  years of high school, but it was never the experience I had hoped for. 

For reference, I am now 21 years old, I am in University, and I have  managed to flip my life upside down and become a social butterfly. If  you were to meet me and talk to me now you would think I am a natural.  It took a long time and it took a lot of me getting outside of my  comfort zone and taking risks. It was a painful process and at times I  didn’t think it was possible. Below, I will list some of the things that  helped me throughout this transformation:

**1) Train your “bold” muscle.**

Just like we have physical muscles, we also have a social muscle, or  as I like to call it, a “bold” muscle. Every time we take a social risk,  the muscle grows stronger, and our schema of the world grows. The next  time we take that same risk, it is much easier to do so because we have  already experienced what it is like to take such a risk. During my tough  years of high school, I knew that I struggled with social skills, and I  knew that the only way I could become a “natural” was through  experience. If you are in a similar situation, understand that at the  beginning of your process, being bold and taking risks will feel awkward  at times and that sometimes you will think about all of these awkward  moments right before going to sleep at night. However, the only way to  train your “bold” muscle, is, well, to be bold, to take social risks,  and to do the things that you are afraid of. This brings me to my next  point.

**2) Take baby steps.**

You’re not going to start off as the natural guy who is able to talk  to everyone in a confident manner. It will take time, and it will take  baby steps. I used to try to train my “bold” muscle in the smallest ways  possible. For example, in class, I would make it a goal to participate  within the first 15 minutes. I didn’t care what I said, or if it even  made any sense, I simply had to raise my hand and participate within the  first 15 minutes. It was a simple goal. Soon, I was able to participate  in class whenever I wanted.

Here is another example. I made it a goal to have simple  conversations with people, things like saying hi to acquaintances, or  asking people how their summer went. At first, I was not able to hold  conversations for too long, especially with people who I saw as having  more value than me, the people who I considered popular. I could only  talk for a maximum of 30 seconds, and then I had to make an excuse to  leave. But over time, I was able to train myself to effortlessly have  conversations for however long I wanted. I’m at a point now where I can  walk up to anyone and be confident and charismatic, and feel zero social  anxiety. I am able to lead conversations and understand the nuances of  body language and energy. I am able to engage people and make  conversations fun and interesting. This all takes time to learn, and the  only way to learn it is to practice, one little step at a time. 

**3) Focus on becoming friends with good people rather than with popular people.** 

This is something that took me a long time to learn, and it was  something I needed to experience to learn. I always knew this  instinctively but I had to see it for myself, and maybe you need to go  through that process too. I wanted to be popular and I wanted popular  friends. Everything changed at University. I became quite social and was  able to talk to anyone, and I had some of the fun that I had missed out  on in high school. I even became good friends with a few “popular”  guys.

But after spending time with people, I stopped caring about status.  Now, I purely care about how good a person is. I care about true  friendship. I care about how honest and respectful someone is, how much I  vibe with someone, whether that person truly cares for me, and whether  we have similar tastes and hobbies. If your only aim is to be friends  with popular people, then you are bound to fail, because your intentions  are in the wrong place. This is something that you’re probably going to  have to learn from experience, simply reading about it might not be  enough.

**4) Put yourself in positions to succeed.**

Join clubs, join a sports team, maybe even join a frat if you’re in  college. The point is, sometimes it’s too difficult to do it all  yourself. Sometimes you need the environment handed to you. You need a  place where you can practice. You need events to go to. You need people  to be around. Sometimes you need the excuse of being a part of something  like a team or a club in order to talk to people.

**5) Focus on self-improvement in other areas as well.**

Try to work on other areas of yourself as well. For example, I  started lifting weights in high school. It took me a long time to see  progress, but it was worth it. Try to wear well-fitted and nice clothes,  they don’t have to be expensive. There are a couple of good subreddits  dedicated to male fashion. Get a nice haircut, and groom yourself well.  Find a barber that you like. Study at school, read books, be creative  and work on projects that you are interested in and passionate about.  Working on yourself in one area will make you confident in other areas  and will help you on your path to becoming a social butterfly.

**Final thoughts.**

This post is a message to all the people who are in the same position  I used to be in. I know that there are probably people who are in high  school or university who are going through a rough time socially.  Perhaps some of these people are extroverts in nature just like I am  (someone who gains their energy through social interaction), but are  forced to isolated lives, unable to properly express themselves because  they have too many mental barriers keeping them in a state of scarcity.  Perhaps this is you or someone you know. Perhaps you are shy and filled  with social anxiety. Perhaps you lack the proper role models. Perhaps  you are depressed. Perhaps you want to be cool and popular and someone  with many friends, and someone who has no fear and can express their  thoughts and energy freely. Perhaps you want to tame your social anxiety  and become natural, to be someone who can do what they want when they  want in social settings.

I’m telling you that it can be done. Practice. Take baby steps. Try little things. Don’t get upset at yourself when you fail.

I used to get very upset at myself and tell myself that I hated  myself, that I was a loser, and that I was going to be unhappy forever.  It’s easy for me to sit here now and say that it won’t always be like  that. Try to have some hope. Try to take some social risks. Try to build  that “bold” muscle of yours. You’ll become a natural one day and maybe  you’ll be able to help others who are struggling. You’re going to go  through a lot of ups and downs and a lot of failures. Be kind to  yourself.

It’s a process. It’s not linear. Progress will be good, then bad,  then very bad, and then back to good. It will take time for you to reach  a point where there is consistency and stability.

i still don't know if if i am going to be in the same area as him come fall (and he hasn't asked me about it yet) but he recently hit me with that yung what's up and we've been talking ever since. sure, it took him a hot minute to get back to me after the initial (i was kind of scared that he was going to see it as a mistake and unadd/block me or just leave me on read again) but we're kind of back in the rhythm of talking that we were before (responding every few hours but not leaving me on read).

i for sure have had the the strongest feelings for any guy that i've had before for this dude so would really do what i could to make this work if he wanted that too \*i have not said anything about this to him and probably never will unless prompted\* (both of our situations for the foreseeable future, at least imo are conducive to ldr)
