1,ruq6y3,1641175942,"Consider making reasonableness (and the corresponding ability to reason) a high priority when thinking about qualities you want in a partner. From reasonableness stems a whole host of important things like communication, admitting when one is wrong, and wise decision-making.","I find that the more I meet others, the more I realize that reasonableness is a core trait that is both rare and exceedingly important. I've experienced a lot of arguments in the past with people who are stubborn even in the face of being proven wrong, cannot think of a reason why they do harmful things and yet will not consider changing, and overall cannot communicate effectively. When reasonable people are overwhelmed with emotion, they tend to recognize it and communicate that they need time alone or care in that moment rather than lashing out. If reasonable people do lash out, they tend to apologize.

I find that reasonableness usually corresponds not just with the ability to reason but also with compassion and empathy -- reasonable people tend to care about the feelings of others because they regularly consider the other person's position when reasoning. 

Reasonableness can be learned and can be practiced. No one is perfect and no one is perfectly reasonable all the time. However, anyone can become a reasonable person with time and effort. I think that the more we select for it, the more stability and safety can be found in the relationships that follow.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ruq6y3/consider_making_reasonableness_and_the/

3,ruqe0h,1641176486,Guy is clearly uncomfortable around me but is always asking to hang out,"I know this guy from work. I’ve been out with him several times, just quick outings after work and each and every time has been incredibly awkward. 
Conversation is so forced, usually restricted to brief small talk and every other minute is just dead silence. There is no way that he doesn’t feel the awkwardness either. 

At work, I hear him messing around with other female coworkers. He clearly gets along so much better with them, cracking jokes, playfully pushing them around etc. I hear them laughing together throughout my shifts. However, all of these girls are already in relationships (and he does know this). 

He is repeatedly asking me to hang out with him, even buying me small gifts. I can’t understand why he does this, when our time spent together is consistently uncomfortable. I can’t even make him laugh like the other girls at work can. I’m also objectively clapped, so my looks definitely aren’t keeping him around. 

I’m paranoid that he thinks I’m an easy target, or something? It’s the only logical explanation I have for him trying to stick around me, as our interactions are so unenjoyable and I’m not ultra attractive.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ruqe0h/guy_is_clearly_uncomfortable_around_me_but_is/

6,ruqh3k,1641176720,Long term relationship - stay or leave?,"26F here, I’m in a unique situation and would love to hear the thoughts of people who have been in the dating world. 

I met my current bf when we were 13, and we were friends until we started dating at 18. We were high school sweethearts and are still together almost 8 years later. We are in a situation where he needs to move to another state to pursue his dreams/goals, and that is not a place where I see myself being happy. As the decision comes up, I find myself re-evaluating the relationship as I see it as a re-commitment of the relationship if I do choose to follow him and move. For those of you wondering, we’re not ready for marriage yet. Here are my thoughts:

1. I think our relationship is overall great, but sometimes I feel as if there are things that could be better. But I assume that nobody is perfect and accept the things that aren’t to my liking because that’s what I think love is. Sometimes I do wonder if I’m settling, or if he is with me too. I love him but never get the gut feeling that he’s the one. 

2. I haven’t dated anyone else which was fine, but now that I am entering my late twenties, I begin thinking about how I have no other context or experiences to compare it to. I would hate to have to start over even later, at 29 or 30. I wonder if I will have regrets if I don’t explore now. 

3. If I moved with him, it would be great for me financially. I’d be able to save a lot of money, so I know that it is a smart choice that would set me up for the future. 

My question is, do I understand that this is a solid, strong relationship and have the confidence to move with him and continue our long dating streak, or is it truly possible that there is someone out there that you will feel in your gut that they are the one? Am I naive in thinking that that is how it works?

If I do choose to leave him, I would also be making a financial sacrifice (higher rent, less savings, etc) and I’ve heard dating horror stories of terrible dates, people not connecting with anyone, being treated as a hookup, etc… so if this was the case for me, I would be devastated to leave something good in an effort to find something perfect. 

I’m curious to hear from other people who have found the one, been dating around, or have been in long term relationships regarding my situation. Thank you!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ruqh3k/long_term_relationship_stay_or_leave/

23,rurvvp,1641180917,Unsure if it’d be smart to get into a relationship with this girl,"I 21M have been dating this 20F girl for several months now. We are currently “casual” at the moment but we’ve recently talked about possibly becoming exclusive relationship. We have a lot in common and I really like the girl but there are some things that I’m cautious about or potential red flags. For starters she just has an absurd amount of guy friends and also goes out to a lot of frat parties and knows a ton of frat dudes, (“she’s told me stories about how she’s been drunk before and she lets them dress her and they’ve even seen her completely naked”). She also is kind of a party girl, and while I go out a fair share myself, she goes out a lot and almost never invites me out with her and whenever I invite her out she usually isn’t interested and prefers just staying in and watching a movie with me (which I don’t complain about but I don’t understand why she prefers going out to bars/clubs with her guy friends rather than me). We’ve both agreed that while we’re not exclusive yet we prefer that we’re only intimate with each other and she told me she hasn’t done anything with another guy since we started dating.
Im not at all the emotionally controlling type but I’d rather not hop into a relationship where I’m going to be cheated on. I’m willing to trust her until she gives me a reason not to. I don’t mind if she goes out with friends either but it’d be cool if she included me in her going out plans sometimes. So I just don’t know if this girl is a walking red flag or I’m just being too skeptical for no reason.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rurvvp/unsure_if_itd_be_smart_to_get_into_a_relationship/
24,rurxgh,1641181054,Feeling bummed out &amp; confused,"I’m f(22) This guy m(32) I’ve been dating to since the end of august went on a work trip 3 weeks ago and won’t be back until the end of January. We became exclusive really quickly I’d think, we saw each other 3 times before deciding that … he told me he doesn’t like to juggle people and only likes to focus his attention on one person at a time. I at the moment wasn’t looking for anything serious, and wanted to casually date more to protect my heart because feelings scare me but at the same time wasn’t opposed to something if it happened. So he happened and I thought, well in this day and age dating sucks because people aren’t honest with their intentions, themselves and let alone with you so here I found a guy that is showing promising qualities, he’s into me and I’m into him… let’s give it a go. We see each Other 1-2 times a week. We don’t really text much, let alone a phone call in between the times we see each other. He has expressed that he’s not much of texter and in the past it has been an issue with girls he’s dated because they think he’s not interested but he told me he doesn’t want me to think that, that just because he’s not texting me doesn’t mean he’s not thinking of me. I can understand that, and I don’t need to text 24/7 so I respect his space, as he does with me. When we hang out, it’s so nice, I feel respected, we joke around, conversations flow and no phones in sight, attention on each other. the night he left, the sex felt different. It felt very passionate, I almost wanted to cry because of how intense the feeling was. We agreed to atleast one FaceTime a week to talk… it’s been 3 weeks and nothing. We both have demanding jobs, his more than mine but I figured if we can make time to see each Other we can find 5-10 min once a week to talk… I’m not asking for much I don’t think. I try to be understanding since like I said his job is more demanding than mine and because he is at a different state he’s 3 hours ahead. but it’s hard to be understanding when he’s posting on Snapchat that he’s at bars with his coworkers. I gave him days and times I would be available for a call and in the text I put “ call me when you can” he misunderstood and called me as soon as I sent that text, but since we were both working we couldn’t talk. The week has passed and he didn’t call me. Needless to say I feel upset. Neglected. Bummed out. He texted me New Year’s Day with this mediocre happy New Years message, I replied with just as simple message. I want to express how bummed out I am, but don’t want to do it over text, I want him to call me. But since I already went out of my way the first time I don’t feel like waiting it out until he reaches out to me. It feels like we only text if I reach out. He sends me memes on ig, which is cool I guess but no conversations with real substance. He has initiated plans to hangout but for the most part it’s me making the plans. I didn’t really mind that because I’m a believer on girls making plans too and not letting the guy do everything, but seeing how little effort he’s making during this work trip is making me take a step back and reflect on how things have been going so far. I felt guarded but he made me feel safe to let my guard down but now I just want to guard myself again… 

I don’t want to jump into conclusions or make assumptions but like I said .. if he can go to a bar he can give me a call or atleast text me to see if I can take the call. I havn’t met his friends, same with him. It’s been very private so far which I like. I only have one other relationship for experience and it was very toxic (3 years ago). He hasn’t had a relationship since his ex fiancée (6years ago). I thought things were going well since we’ve even made plans as far as March (spring break trip). I’ve never done that with a guy so it’s a big deal to me, questioning what it might mean to him.

I feel very confused … I was feeling secure before he left now I’m feeling insecure because I’m not sure where we stand. I’m not in a rush for the gf title … but now I feel confused if we’re even on the same page. He’s made every move to get to where we are at… and now that I’m finally allowing myself to feel it almost feels like he’s retracting. 

He was the one who said he’s not into hooking up or friends with benefits 

He’s the one who said he wanted to build a connection not just a sexual one 

He sent me this meme  a while ago which at first I didn’t think much of but now has me thinking twice about many things

So, let’s genuinely think about this. I know it’s gross to assign people numbers but it’s an easy way to do this.

Let’s say this woman that’s a 7 or an 8 is sitting at a bar or is at a party or some other social event.

Two guys see her, one is a super confident 8 and one’s a unconfident low self esteem 4. We all know who’s got a better chance. Now let’s change this. Let’s say a super confident 8 and super confident 4. The 8 is still winning out.

Now let’s say a confident 4 and an unconfident 8. Neither have a very good chance. Like a woman that’s an 8 wouldn’t waster her time talking to a 4, but the guys lack of confidence would repel her.

So I have came to the conclusion that confidence isn’t attractive. It’s like being a nice person. Neither are attractive they are both the bare minimum and absence of either instantly makes you unattractive.

32,ruset3,1641182549,I (24F) can't tell if he's losing interest or if he's just busy/taking space?,"New so forgive me if this isn't the right place to post this.

So I (24F) have recently gotten back into the dating scene (online/app dating) after a few years of being single. I've never done the dating app thing so it's all new to me but I've been on a few dates since downloading one. I recently started talking to this guy (24M) who I thought I got along with pretty well. We like the same music, have the same taste in jokes/memes/etc, and we're both pretty relaxed and laid-back in general. Our first date was brunch and I thought it was going to be a quick bite/chatting but it ended up being a very fun &amp; spontaneous 12-hour date and we met for a second time the next day at his house after I got off work (11pm- we didn't have sex FYI, just some kissing and a little grinding by both of us; I made it clear to him that I wasn’t really ready to go all the way with him yet which he was very respectful of reassured me of not needing to rush), and then we met for a third time two days later for NYE fireworks that I'd invited him out to see if he wasn't doing anything (which again, I personally thought we had a great time together which was like 11pm-3am). After the end of our NYE date I asked him if we wanted to still meet up over the weekend or if this kind of negated that so to speak (because we had originally made plans for a weekend date before I'd asked him to watch fireworks) and he sorted hesitated for a few minutes and seemed to mull it over before he said he really needed to study and get some rest in because he's in the military and he'll be advancing to a new rank soon so he was saying how he needed to start prepping for that. I said no biggie and ended up going home shortly after.

Fast forward to the next day (New Years day), I asked him what he was doing to be friendly and he said studying/relaxing and asked me how my work was. At the same time, my sister had convinced me to just ask him that if he got his studying done during the day, maybe we could meet up that night for an at home pizza &amp; movie? So I told him how my day was then asked about potentially meeting later and I didn't hear from him for 24 hours (so today; and he basically said he had really unplugged to study). I told him no biggie again because obviously everyone needs to unplug sometimes and I (now lowkey kicking myself for it) asked if he wanted to grab a sandwich if he was going to take a break later and he said ""I'm all set for today to be honest. Thanks for the offer though!"" I replied okay, sounds good :) and then that was that. No reply since.

&amp;#x200B;

I know these 3 dates have been within this past week so obviously we've spent a LOT of time together over the past few days and I totally understand that &amp; him needing a break or whatever... but I'm most definitely an over-thinker and obviously we have no commitments to one another at the present moment but I do genuinely like him so far and I feel like we click (and he's hinted to me a few times that he does like me/my presence/hanging out as well as that he's very into being honest/blunt/clear and on NYE I'd mentioned how I thought he was a little hard to read sometimes and he said ""Am I? I think I'm being pretty clear"") However, that being said, I'm definitely unsure how to feel about the way he last replied because I feel like it doesn't quite match the vibes of how he's been so far. So really I just want some people's opinions on whether you guys think it sounds like he could still be interested but maybe just needs some space or if he could be losing interest (or if it's too soon to tell?)

Also mind you all, I feel like he's not as great at texting vs in person talking (and I did kind of jokingly mention it to him at some point how he talks WAY more in person vs thru text and he said oh for sure) and he did say he hates making decisions and let's other people make decisions when it comes to things like where to eat/what to do/etc (like he's very chill and open to doing whatever) so like... given we've been on three dates, I want to assume he's somewhat interested in me (otherwise he would've said he was busy or not agreed to the other two meet-ups, I'd assume) and if it's just a case of him wanting some space for a few days before he heads back in to work/school, if I don't hear from him in the next few days should I try to reach out at some point again and see if we could make another date or would that be too desperate/pushy seeming?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I've gone on 3 dates with this guy (all seemingly well) but all yesterday he was MIA (due to studying &amp; just unplugging for the day) and today when I tried to ask if he wanted to catch a bite to eat he turned me down and I haven't heard back from him the rest of the day. Can't tell if he's still interested but trying to step back for the weekend while he studies or if this is supposed to be a hint that he's no longer interested. Seems like major mixed signals for the latter though.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ruset3/i_24f_cant_tell_if_hes_losing_interest_or_if_hes/

I 27F have been crushing on my friend 29M for months now. I met him at work, and became friends with him while I was in a 3 year relationship, but my ex and I (thankfully) broke up last June. I've been on dates with other people, but I soon realized that I only wanted to be around him, and have liked him ever since we met (though I buried those feelings because I was already in a monogamous relationship at the time). I could go into so many details about how incredible he is, like his emotional awareness, his adventurous spirit, his deep kindness and consideration of those who have less than him, his joyous and curious nature and fun attitude, and how we never seem to have enough time to talk about the things we are passionate about.

He was there for me when I was recovering from my unhealthy previous relationship, and is all around a fantastic person. I want to tell him I like him, or maybe increase flirtatious actions (I'm hopeless with this), but I'm uncertain of where to start. Should I be blunt and lay it all out? Should I start sending flirtatious signals? He's British and I am Canadian, so I am wondering if there are cultural differences in how to approach this as well. I am concerned though that I have been friendzoned because of how he was an emotional support at the end of my previous relationship, though perhaps this doesn't matter because what's important is that I shoot my shot, right? 

I deeply respect him and his boundaries, and haven't said anything yet for fear of losing the friendship. If he doesn't feel the same, it will hurt, but not nearly as much as if I couldn't have him in my life, since I still really value our friendship regardless. I'll respect his feelings if he doesn't reciprocate.

I’ve recently started talking to someone and they revealed something about how they operate in their continued relationship with the father that concerns me.  She said because there child (4 years old) requests it that they all still do things together like a family on a week to week basis.

So I understand when you have a child with someone a certain amount of keeping that person in your life is necessary for coparenting.  With my daughters mom we still have phone conversations about her needs for school, behavioral issues, etc and will sometimes both go to school events etc.  However we never spend time together just to be together like a family despite being separated.

I guess I’m trying to figure out how to wrap my head around.  Is this a normal thing that I should be accommodating to if I want to date someone with kids?  I would never want to replace or even look like I was trying to replace a parents role with a child.  However I’d also hesitate to get more emotionally invested in pursing a relationship with this dynamic.  Unsure how to feel about it and seeking advice on how others would feel or handle it if in that scenario.

53,rutndz,1641186421,What is so great about “oatmeal love”?,"I remember a friend of mine was talking about “oatmeal love”. She described it as the kind of love that comes after the butterflies and red-hot passion withers away and you find yourself with a love that’s just kind of….there. She calls it “oatmeal love” because on the surface oatmeal may not seem like the most exciting meal and it may taste a little bland but it’s still warm and comforting. And she says it’s better than that crazy passion/infatuation you feel in the beginning stages of a relationship. 

Now I have never been in a relationship for more than six months so I never experienced this, “oatmeal love” that she talked about. But one of my favorite parts about romance is that adrenaline rush that you feel in the early stages when your heart feels like it’s going to burst out of your chest every time you think about the person, when you get butterflies when you think about their next date with them, how the person is constantly on your  mind, and et.cetra…..and this “oatmeal love” she describes sounds kind of boring.

1) A guy hit on her in her college
2) She told him she has a bf
3) He says she should have told him before and not wait till he kept hitting on her. In her defense she didnt feel necessary to clear everything to everyone(which I kinda agree)

5) They both visited my gfs city and lived together for a week
6) Gf hid the instagram story wish from me(unproven yet) in which the guy wished her a Happy Birthday. It was a 2 sentence long msg in which the guy said how its a ""new beginning"" for both of them etc etc. Gf says it is because their friendship was ruined &amp; it was mended later and things are fine now.
7) The 3 of them(+another guy) went together on a snow trip on new years, they got drunk for a day or two. Gf says she slept after drinking alone. 
8) (important point) Gf and I we meet today, starting a trip for 5 days. Gf shows me a bite mark that I did before she went to her new year trip. We met almost 25 days ago.

I tend to go for girls in their mid to late 20’s - and they’re all over fbook posting pictures and updates almost on a daily basis.
I occasionally meet someone while I’m out on the town, and I’ll get the phone number, but I’ll often get asked if I have Facebook. I’m wondering if I am shooting myself in the foot by giving it out, since I don’t think it adds much value for me from a dating perspective. On the flip side, I think it’d be odd not to give it out when asked.

I’m wondering if I should just bite the bullet and spruce up my Facebook profile, or if it even matters that much - since everyone on there has already met me in person.

We had a third date 4 days after, during the date I realized that even tho I loved the first two dates and hanging out with her, the fact that she just started dating and me being so experienced makes us so incompatible sexually, which is also very important to me.

We're both in our early 20s and we're both really busy with school and work. 

So far, we've been on one date which went well (no physical interaction though) and we haven't been able to go on a second date due to our schedule and her catching covid.

I'm not 100% sure how attracted she is to me and what she wants to pursue with me. And i think she feels the same way with me with unsure about my feelings because I'm not the best at expressing myself emotionally, especially through text messages. I suck at flirting but i try my best.

I kinda what to be direct and just ask her what she wants from this. And I'll start by briefly saying that she's incredible and I wouldn't mind pursuing a relationship. But i worry that it's too early and that i may scare her off. 

I mainly want to do this to get clarity on her feelings about me and not waste time. She takes up a lot of my mental head space, even though I'm seeing other women as well. She's gorgeous, always laughs at my jokes, and just a cool person to chat with. I'm sure she feels the same way about me but I'm not sure how far that goes romantically.

Is this a self esteem issue? Probably. But not sure if what I want to do is an appropriate next step. Maybe just ask her out on the second date and bring this up???

87,ruws3q,1641197951,I'm not in love with my Girlfriend anymore,"Sorry for the long post but I could really use some help

Me (23M) and my (25F) have been dating for around 9 months now. And around 2 months ago we decided to move into an apartment together so that I could get away from my parents and she could move out of her other place. Since then things have been getting worse. 

To start we argue over little things all the time whether it be helping with dishes or laundry and if I do something she doesn't like.

Her spending habits are horrible. She will buy things that she absolutely does not need behind my back. For example, we went to a thrift store just to look around and talk about decorations for the apartment for when we get payed next. We looked around for a bit and decided to leave. Turns out she ended up buying a pack of drink coasters that we didn't need. 2 weeks later she said she doesn't want them and threw them out. 

She's way too controlling over everything. She wants everything done a certain way. The way she washes dishes, folds laundry, and cleans has to be done a certain way and if I try to help and I do it wrong she gets really frustrated with me to the point of ignoring me for a couple hours. I feel like the apartment that we got together is hers and I just live here. I have no place here.

The things that I do are never enough for her. I work 40-50 hour weeks at a restaurant and do doordash at the same time for money. Our agreement was that she would cover her bills and the rent and I would cover utilities. But somehow she's always short on money. I pay electric, gas, internet, tv, and now her car, insurance, and other misc. Bills she has. 

I do all of this, then come home to cook and clean, all while I'm trying to go to school too. All so we can have a better life. And the free time that I do get to have to myself gets interrupted by her needing help with something or wanting to spend time together. We already spend every waking moment together and I have almost no time to myself.

This has gotten to the point that my mental and physical health is taking a massive dip. I'm depressed and angry all the time and I feel terrible 24/7. I don't even have a chance to feel like an adult or myself because she nags me about everything in my life. Taking my meds, staying up too late, etc. 

I'm just not happy anymore. I don't want to leave her solely for the fact that I do still care for her and I worry about what will happen if I do leave. How she will pay for bills, and her mental health too. She's very clingy, but extremely independent. 

The biggest thing for me is what will I do. I have no other family besides my parents that I don't get along very well with. And if I leave her, that leaves me with no one and no where to go.
