I’ve read a few articles over the past year or so that paint a bleak picture of the dating scene today and in the immediate future. I’m certain there is an element of media scaremongering in all of them, but I’ve thought very deeply about them and wanted to get others’ opinions/input. 

To summarize: Despite everything we hear about the gender pay gap, more women are enrolled in college right now than men, and for years, more women have been graduating than men. More and more women are becoming working professionals and making comfortable sums while more men are losing ground in terms of financial viability. One article interviewed professional women in NYC who were having a hard time finding suitable men who made as much as them. Another used a phrase like “breeding apocalypse” to describe the increasingly disproportionate ratio of professional women to “broke dudes.” The consensus at this point seems to be that college-educated professional women are less likely to date or consider dating men who aren’t also college-educated professionals. With the number of college-educated professional men shrinking, that leaves fewer and fewer choices. 

My apologies if I haven’t summed this up very well, but my question is: Where does society at large (and dating in general) go from here? What will the future look like? My first thought was that we’d seen a large and growing class of disenfranchised young men who are deemed unworthy of dating or mating with, but then again, with such lopsided numbers, we could also see women loosening their financial standards for potential partners while more men occupy decently paying trade jobs. 

It could go one of a thousand ways, but I’m certain that we’re seeing a shift in a different direction.

I know it's a bit of a ""how long is a piece of string?"" question really, and I know one woman can't answer for everyone, that is not what I'm implying, I'm just trying to get a sense for it.

I'm finding that most of the conversations I have with girls, even if the conversations are good and we seem into each other and we're finding interesting stuff to talk about, generally fizzle out after not too long, maybe 10-20 messages or so.

I’ve had 2 serious relationships that  both ended terribly and catapulted me to go to therapy. I’ve been in therapy for almost 3 years on and off now and have grown so much in my confidence in relationships and what I want. Now I’m slowly entering the dating scene again and I realized something HUGE last night. People show their true colors to you in about 2 weeks.

There’s two guys I’m talking to. One was very considerate about me being sick and saying I had to cancel our date. He offered to buy me lunch to make me feel better. His small action really made me feel cared for and seen. He approached the situation in a mature way.

The other guy I’m talking to has fun conversation with me , but he completely ignored important things I was telling him and it made me feel unseen. Last night I broke down into tears and asked myself why I was so upset. I was upset because it reminded me of my past self who settled for less and allowed people to treat me however they wanted to on their time. It reminded me of my ex who was more into his own self than making an active effort to have conversation about my wants and needs. Needless to say after this breakdown, I realized guy 2 was making me anxious and this wasn’t a healthy attachment right off the bat. If it isn’t making me feel good I need to listen to my gut and act on that feeling. While guy 1 isn’t exactly my type, he’s been actively conscious of me aka asking how I’m feeling, talking about my interests, etc.I haven’t felt at all anxious when talking to him or thinking about him. Needless to say I do not think I’m going to talk to guy 2 anymore bc it really opened my eyes to who he is. 

Men and women-listen to your gut. It’s easy to ignore signs and red flags bc you like the attention and fun of dating, but in the end you already have the information laid out.

We've gone on two dates and one kinda pseudo date. 

 We were getting along grand. All the text conversations went pretty well. Big looong paragraphs. Even kept it up while I was on tour with the band in another country. Every day. Just chatting bollox,about music, everything. 
 Dates went ok/good too I think. 

In reality I probably should've taken off the rose tinted glasses and seen that she would consistently reply a good bit of time afterwards whereas I'd take like 1hr tops. Body language was very awkward on the third date too. Although she said she enjoyed herself and would do it again after the first one. Said the 2nd went good too. Third one probably could've gone better. It went great I thought but again,I haven't a clue how to gauge how a woman's feeling. 

Ghosting began the evening after that. I gave her space for that day and a half cause she had a super important exam. Thought about wishing her luck that day but I imagine she's been able be disciplined,and stay off the phone, and not get distracted (unlike myself) so I didn't. Should've though.

Texted her then yesterday to see if I could call, no response. Unsent the text. I'd say it's done that's the final blow. I see her active the odd time. See her post to her stories Message received. 

Definitely had feelings for her. Well probably still have. I pinch myself cause she is objectively out of my league. Like she's really cute. And super smart, funny and runs a magazine. She's cool

She could be thinking about anything. Apparently she just got out of a long relationship so that could be something she's thinking about. Or our mutual friend who's in hospital but can't be visited. It's a tough time. 


Maybe it's just me being impatient. 
But I'm accepting rejection. I would like to just hear it properly. I've let conversations die naturally as well in the past after a first date but after this much? I dunno is it wrong to want a no? I want to be rejected and move on. 

At the same time I don't wanna call her and give her some ultimatum. I value her choice and emotions as a grown ass woman. 

It gets muddier then. Texted a girl from years ago on tinder that I'm not even that interested in. That's not the play or maybe it is I dunno. 

Reading all these online articles about dating can be useful and also accelerates the emotional rollercoaster. As a man in my early 20's who's never been in a relationship. This was a great experience cause I got to feel (even if it wasn't real) what it was like to feel someone was interested in me. 

It's a learning experience anyway sure. I've learnt loads. Now I need to get back to my assignments and not fail this degree cause I couldn't stop thinking about yer wan. Ill try be patient and who knows maybe she installed insta and is ignoring me till exams are over. Time will tell

TLDR Recognize yer being needy before it's too late lol

Yet, these guys are somehow still struggling with dating.

Having status and your shit together is extremely attractive to women, but it certainly isn’t enough. The problem is that these type of guys are too safe— they assume that since they fit the mold of what society says women want,i.e. stability, that they should automatically be successful with women. Wrong.

Women are drawn to men who have some edge to them. This doesn’t mean being aggressive or a dick. You can still be kind and have edge and some balls. There are some elements to this:

Style: conveying polarity and masculinity is more important than being naturally handsome. Do you notice that you’ll see attractive women with guys women who have tattoos, or have some element to their look that is atypical of what you see every day? This is an element of polarity that draws in the most attractive women; they are drawn to guys who stand out physically and don’t necessarily conform to what society expects them to do. This doesn’t mean you have to go out and get tattoos, piercings, or dress strangely. It does, however, that you shouldn’t be afraid to take some chances with your style, and incorporate that into how you project yourself. Think of how you want to convey masculinity in your look, in a way the makes your comfortable. If you’re balding, take the step and shave your head; if you’ve wanted to wear certain colors that are outside of your comfort zone of what you typically wear. Or wear a cologne that makes you confident, but might be considered a little bold or polarizing.

Attitude. It may sound arrogant on the surface, but you have to carry the belief in you that you are an interesting person and any woman would be lucky to be with you. Again, there needs to be balance to this because it will veer into arrogance, but research has shown that people are attracted to those who are superior to them in some manner. Focus on areas in your life that you excel and can offer to others. When you are interacting with a beautiful woman, you can’t hold onto the belief that she holds all the cards. Beauty is common.

Physicality. Quite simply, physical activities that allow you to compete with others or push you physically provide an almost immediate sense of confidence. Whether it is boxing, MMA, lifting weights, playing pickup basketball, the examples are endless. When you consistently put yourself in situations that stress your body or you are directly competing with others, you will have an air about you that will translate into your social interactions.

Opinions and boundaries. “I’m not sure, what do you think?” should be removed from everyone’s lexicon. Women who are attracted to men who are decisive, and know what they want. Too often, the oposite occurs. Men are afraid to have balls, to say what is on their mind, even if it might offend or be met with disagreement. Sometimes this can be uncomfortable. However, being too deferential and nice is the quickest path to having a woman lose respect and attraction. This doesn’t mean you have to be a rigid asshole who doesn’t consider the opinions of others, but you have to lead. When a woman makes the majority of the decisions with her man following, the masculine and feminine energies are flipped.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1132765,public,self,Women want men with an edge and some balls.

His reply was: ""That's ok, I understand. Don't worry, honestly. If there is anything within my power that I could do, if you need anything that would make your life less chaotic, let me know"" and 1 hour after that messages me again saying ""Who knows if we bump into each other  😂"". I replied with a GIF of Joe from the ""You"" series and told him ""this is what came to mind when I read your last message"". He then said ""Hey, I'm not one to do this 😂 (exactly what a stalker would say to throw off any suspicion)"". I replied with ""Hahaha now I fear that I'm being observed 👀"" and his answer was ""Maybe you would even enjoy it 😂""

Not thinking anything of it. Later on in the night we ended up complaining to one another about not having a FWB in the city live in. He asked me to go smoke a j with him back at his house. One thing led to another and we made out his couch, but I was quickly not into it. He asked me to go back his bed with him and I refused. He kept trying to put his hand around my neck, looking back I think it was an attempt at turning me on. Anyways I sat there awkwardly afterwards and left. He begged me not to tell anyone and I totally agreed. Fast forward a week and I ended up mentioning it to two co-workers I trusted. They were shocked but unsurprised. I only planned on telling those friends and never mentioning it to anyone.

   Fast forward two more weeks after and I don’t have my original shifts posted on the schedule. Downgraded to one shift a week. My manager tells me I’ve been getting complaints about me. The issue is resolved but still , im assuming he didn’t single me out  because he talked to another employee. But the impression I got when he spoke to me that we was delighted by the power dynamic between us, almost like revenge. I ended up complaining to a lot of the other staff, this wasn’t a smart move but I felt like I needed to tell people in case he were to fire me .I am alone in a very new, big city with no family and few close friends.

    A few days later I confronted him and asked verbatim if my choice to not sleep with him Influenced his decision on taking my shift away. He was basically sweating and denying the whole time which is unsurprising . Anyways I felt like it was resolved and things were going back to normal. Now he treats me even worse. He messaged me to ask about a tables bill and gave me the impression that I was in trouble. When I asked what was wrong he said “it’s not about you again so don’t worry“ We’ll if it wasn’t about me why was I contacted ? Now one co worker I told is very cold with me and ignores me . Possibly they are sleeping together too, that’s the vibe I get. I could be wrong ,,if so i don’t care.I’m just tired of getting treated like shit by my manager because I didn’t sleep with and to my dismay told everybody.

   Now he’s possibly sleeping with another co worker and they’re both mean to me. I can’t quit because I need this job and I like the people I work with excluding the other two. I recognize my own immature faults in this situation, however, I feel I am in a awkward position.

However, I find that I am way more judgmental and non-committal when using dating apps. It’s incredibly easy to get a match, feel the rush of dopamine from feeling desirable, and never committing to actually engaging matches in conversation on the app or, more importantly, following through to meet in person (ghosting, if you will). 

Basically, dating apps are really bad at fostering genuine connection, despite how deeply intertwined they’ve become in the social fabric of modern dating. The app developers intentionally make it that way, so we are dependent on repeatedly deleting and redownloading the app when we start to feel isolated/lonely. 

Similarly, it feels like people are typically very antisocial when they go out to clubs, bars, social spaces, etc. with a group of people. Despite the conventional wisdom being that we “go out” to meet new people, it feels people today are content sticking to their group despite (likely) wanting to foster new relationships, especially after isolating alone or in small social circles as a result of COVID.

Anyway, after running to the same problem with our love lives on dating apps, my roommate and I committed to going out with our friends, but branching out as soon as we made it to the venue. Although we initially stuck to our group out of fear of rejection and fear of appearing “creepy,” we eventually swallowed our pride and started approaching new people in a friendly and open way. We both found immediate success. I go two numbers, one for a potential date and another for a potential friend. He was successful too and landed the phone numbers of three potential dates. I’ve decided that we have been “going out” all wrong and that you actually have way a more fulfilling experience by talking to strangers when “going out.” People of all genders want to be approached when in social spaces, but we self-isolate out of our fear of being shot down. Although it won’t always work, the dopamine hit from striking up conversations with strangers in person feels 1000x better than swiping on a dating app from your bed. Delete your app. Get out there. Say hi. Be open. You won’t regret it.

TL;DR: In theory, dating apps are convenient, easy to use, and offer access to a large pool. However, in practice, most dating apps fucking suck at what they were initially designed to help us do better. A lot of people approach “go out” the wrong way by not breaking away from the groups/people they go out and not taking a moment with to chat with stranger/new people. You have an infinitely more fulfilling experience meeting new people in person rather than on an app. Despite it requiring a bit of intentionality and courage to do so, going out and talking to strangers is the better way to find people to date/be friends with.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1132793,public,self,Dating is far more exciting when you go out and approach people in person than on any of the dating apps,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9idso/dating_is_far_more_exciting_when_you_go_out_and/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

The only exception was my very first girlfriend, whom I loved to death. We were practically glued to each other during the day, gamed all night, could laugh both with and at each other. Unfortunately she discovered a year later that she's a lesbian. 

It got confusing when I noticed I do attract incompatible people. I've only been with broody, poetic women wanting to explore the world with me. Nothing wrong with being that way and I like a good poem and trip, but I need to be able to laugh my butt off. Not *all* the time mind you, but at least with some *frequency*. Anyway, they end up feeling offended or cranky because I ruin some spiritual moment by comparing it to a scene from GTA5, or because they find me flat out immature. I will never forget the sour face of my ex who wanted to travel to India with me and I surprised her with an Oculus headset so we can do all that in Google Earth without actually having to go anywhere. (I still don't see why it's so different)

Enter the age of Tinder, which seemed like the perfect solution. I deliberately filled my profile with a wall of hilarious insanity to make sure I scare away the people who don't match, swiping right at the slightest sign of non-copy paste humor or whenever I could spot a Playstation in the background.

The first like came in from a girl posing on a graveyard while stroking a tombstone. After that, someone on a hilltop staring broodily into the distance. The third one wanted a man who will invite her into his heart so they can dance there. I thought that one might have been a parody, but her photo was black and white so probably not.

I decided to not judge a book by its cover and gave the tombstone girl a like back. She asked me how I would win her heart, and I told her I'd give her a small, stuffed tombstone with my name on it to pet and hug at night. I got unmatched without a word.

Then I dropped it altogether and joined the masses by also swiping right with any woman that simply looked pretty. I got a match with a woman who had ""be yourself"" and the ""comedy"" interest in her profile, which seemed promising. Nonetheless I felt that this time, I might try and take it a bit slower with the ""be yourself"" part this time. Playing by the book by exchanging interests and asking about careers went surprisingly well. 

Came the day after, when she asked me what I was doing and I decided to be myself now. I told her I was constipated on the toilet, but discovered how it's not half that bad when you pretend you're a medieval king on a throne blaming the constipation on his minions who tremble at this baseless accusation, but no one dares to call me out on it. Unmatched without a word.

Whereas honestly, if *whatever* woman would give that response to *me*, I would just fall in love in an instant.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1132802,public,self,I'm hilarious but only serious women like me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9iw2r/im_hilarious_but_only_serious_women_like_me/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

For backstory. I (f26) have been broken up with my 3 year old sons dad for several months, but we are currently still living together purely for the sake of us both being there for our son full time. We get along for the most part, but there is absolutely nothing romantic involved, and we have our own bedrooms.

We met on Tinder, early 20s. There were quite a few “red flags” that communicated to me that his intentions were purely sexual. 
Like, 
- shirtless selfies on sn*p
- only surface level conversations
- trying to get me to his house as quick as possible (I declined the first date there but was fine with 2nd date being at his place)
- and a sexual joke that he made to test the waters before inviting me over. 

Before me going over to his place, he told me that “sex isn’t the only thing on his mind”. I knew he was lying - a guy wouldn’t even had to tell me that if it wasn’t so. 

I was fine with casual - we had sex, I enjoyed it, but as you can imagine, his interest and texting rate dropped down after that meetup.

**I’m fine personally, but I’m worried about the girls that fall for these men that can’t be straightforward about their intentions and lie in order to get sex out of her**. The way he talked to me and asked about my life and kept the conversation going would’ve easily made me believe that he’s not only after the kitty-cat, if I was less experienced and/or younger.

I met her at a party after we made eye contact across the room a few times and she introduced herself to me when I walked past her. A day later, I slid into her dms and asked for her snap and she gave it to me. However, after I got her snap, I found out from a mutual friend that she had a boyfriend so I texted her infrequently just to get to know her better and talked to her at parties, but did not flirt with her. After a month of knowing her, I found out that she broke up with her boyfriend so I began to text her more frequently and flirted with her a little bit. For example, I asked her what she was gonna be for Halloween and she told me and I said that it was a boring costume for someone so interesting and she saved it in Snapchat. I was at a Halloween party with her and I flirted with her and put my arm around her and she flirted back with me because she put her hand on my chest for a few seconds, was comfortable with my contact, and shared a drink with me. Many Redditors agreed that she was flirting with me. 

I decided to ask her to dinner as friends because she just got out of a relationship and didn’t want to rush anything and make her feel uncomfortable. She said she’d get dinner with me, but added that she’s not looking for a relationship right now. I said that I understood and we’d get dinner as friends and she agreed, but the day before the dinner, she texted me and said that getting dinner together was a bad idea because we have different expectations and that we don’t get along that well. After she rejected me, I cut contact with her for two weeks except saying hi in passing. 

Then at my friend’s birthday party, I talked to her and had a casual conversation with her for 5 minutes and planned not to talk to her for the rest of the night. However, when I walked out of a room, she was standing nearby and walked up to me and started playing with my hat for not reason and I asked her why she was doing it and she said why wouldn’t I be playing with your hat. During this conversation, her face was really close to mine and we were making deep eye contact. My drunk ass really wanted to kiss her, but I decided to go for a hug and we hugged for a good 10 seconds.

Then, a few days ago she came over o my apartment to hangout with me and my roommate and she showed me a video and put her hand that was holding her phone on my hand. And a day after that, we were at a party together and she came up and talked to me and she fell forward a bit and I had to catch her and I kept my hands around her waist and back and she didn’t pull away.

Was she just using me for attention or just looking for a hookup and got scared off by my feelings? Is she attracted to me or is she only flirty because she’s drunk? Why did she say that we don’t get along that well, but flirted with me and initiated touch and conversation? How do I get over her? Sorry for ranting, but I just wanted to get it off my chest.

I was REALLY digging nearly everything about her............. Well except when it came time to make plans. She blew me over several times, We talked for 4-5 weeks - AND NEVER HUNG OUT / WENT ON A DATE EVEN ONCE!!! The only reason that I even know for sure that she's real, is because my weekend job entails me delivering food - and I jokingly said one day that you should order food and I can deliver it to you at work and we can talk for a few minutes. 
So after about 2 weeks of talking and being blown off by her twice I was about to say goodbye, because she hadn't answered me in a few days. So I was just going to tell her good luck in your endeavors and all that blah blah blah. And the same morning that I was going to say goodbye she orders a fucking delivery!!! So I got slightly attached again.

Only to be blown off another couple times. Today was like week number five that we were talking and I finally just had to say goodbye. I told her that I couldn't deal with the up and down roller coaster emotional ride anymore. Told her how she knows that I was serious cuz I told her and that I needed the same in return.

In terms of why, its a combination of personal issues in my life that I do not wish on my worst enemy (which includes surviving a severe illness in my teens), focusing really heavily on school, not feeling confident to ask out girls because I was teased in high school for looking really young for my age and in turn, rumors circulating about a potential rejection that would make my life worse. Fortunately though, I overcame all of this with the exception of the focusing heavily on school bit. I'm really passionate about what I'm studying and have ambitions to make a positive change in this world.

As for where I am now, the thing is, I don't feel as though I have any sort of confidence issues. In fact, I am extremely extroverted, I can talk to strangers very easily (including someone who I might be interested by simply introducing myself and striking up a conversation), I like engaging in public speaking and as for the aforementioned fear of talking to women/ rejection issue, I no longer fear that. In the event I do get rejected, I tend to smile, laugh it off and tell the person who I was interested in to simply take what I said as a compliment. It cuts the tension and they usually smile so I take comfort in the fact knowing that I at least did that even if things didn't go anywhere between us. Admittedly, though I have only asked out maybe ten women tops in my life loool.

So my question is where do I go from here?

P.S. I tend to have an aversion to social media (ironic considering I'm post this here). But I am open to trying dating apps.

Thank you so much for reading this :)

As for that pun I promised, what do you call a fake noodle?

Two years ago I started talking to this guy on tinder. He was basically the perfect guy, at least to me. He was very attractive and talented, a former model, he could sing and play a lot of instruments. He told me when we matched that he thought I was very attractive and hot, and that I was the cutest guy in town. We started messaging each other on snapchat and he started talking about how he wants to do all kinds of dirty things to me. I told him that I don't like to talk sexually with someone when I don't know them that well, we've only been talking for a few days at most at that point. He told me that I made it seem like I didn't want to have sex with him, and that I should because I know that he likes me. I told him that I would like to have sex with him, but that I to take things slow, and said he understood.

He went on a first date and it went really well. We had lunch at a diner and then made out, which was my first time. We lived an hour away from each other and he told me that he usually wouldn't drive that far to meet someone and that he didn't think he'd be trying to get into a relationship so soon after his last one ended a few months before then, but that there was something about me that changed his mind on those things, and he held my hand for a bit while he drove me home.

We kept texting afterwards and the told me me that he's obsessed with me and falling for me, how he can see himself spending his life with me, and how the reason other dates I went on didn't lead to another one was because no one else is as smart as me, and that he's probably my perfect match. I told him about bad experiences I've had with people on dating apps before and he said that I must attract crazy people, but now I have him, and he'll sing me to sleep at night. I was elated to have this guy so into me. It was everything I've been wanting for years. 

He told me about how his family was being kicked out of their house by their aunt. He texted me at the bank before he was about to find out if he could get a loan for a new house for his family and I sent him encouraging texts. He told me that I was his sunshine and that he liked how attentive I was.

We planned a second date and he said that he wanted to have sex with me on the second date, and that we'd be boyfriends if it was good. I was a little hesitant, since I'm a virgin and he told me that he was well endowed. He said that I just had to get over it. He also wanted it to be unprotected, saying that he wanted to cum in me.

One day I brought up that I wasn't sure if we were sexually compatible, since he told me a few times that he needed to know if his sexual needs would be fulfilled if we were dating and I didn't really want to have sex with someone that I only knew for a few weeks. He said that he couldn't be with someone who was debating whether they wanted to be with him or not. I really liked this guy and didn't want to lose him, so I sent him a bunch of texts begging him to reconsider. I know it was a very desperate move and I'm not proud of it or justifying it. He said that I acted crazy and made him lose all his feelings for me, and that maybe he could get them back if  I had sex with him. I was going to at first, but after a few days I realized that I didn't want to do that, still wanting my first time to be with someone that I knew for a bit and had a good established connection with, and also we would have had to have sex in his car since his family was losing their house and I couldn't have sex at my house since I still live at home too, and I wanted my first time to be in a bed, and we stopped talking.

Since then I went between thinking that he just wanted to have sex with me to being upset that I lost a really attractive guy who really liked me, the first time anyone's liked me like that in my life. Last month I wanted to know for sure, so I messaged him on social media and asked him if he actually liked me and I ruined it or if he just wanted to sleep with me, and he said that he really did like me at first, and then I ruined it. I regret asking.

We couldn’t see eye to eye on a subject. She found 2 things I did highly disrespectful and said all women would agree. She also said my exes were weak because they didn’t tell me my behaviour was disrespectful. 

My counter was that not everyone sees things the same way and the true disrespect would be in continuing to do something that she found disrespectful. I let her know that now that I knew she felt it was disrespectful, I wouldn’t do it. 

So, here’s what she found disrespectful. 

We were in Vegas and leaving a buddy’s lounge. The 2 valet guys were standing at their podium, I had just opened the door to the car and shut it for my girl. As I was walking around the car my overly drunk buddy kept harping on the fact that we weren’t sticking around to party. I said we had other things to do. He said, like what? I said, starts with s and ends with x. He immediately shut up as I said I enjoy sax practice. I knew what would finally shut him up. She claims the valet guys motioned to her that they saw it as disrespect and wanted to know if she wanted help. Regardless of whether they did, I just see it as a joke. She doesn’t. 

The second thing that came about was when we were standing around in the mall in Vegas, I held her from behind and at times would squeeze tightly with a little, unnoticeable hump (for lack of a better term). Up until this point we were very sexual with each other. 

Also, to this point we hadn’t spent much time in public and were still feeling out how each other works in public spaces with people. 

This caused long discussions and we ultimately called it off as we agreed we wouldn’t see eye to eye. 

Everything else seemed great between us and we were very communicative. In fact, we dealt with this situation by talking instead of arguing or fighting. Our communication was on point.

My friends are all equally gorgeous women by societal standards, all have very fun and lively personalities, and have fulfilling lives. After knowing them for so long, I honestly don’t see much of a difference in any of them.

Here are my unpopular opinions based on my lived experiences:

1) If a first date doesn't go to a second one, I think the most common reason is because of lack of sexual attraction.

I've been on first dates where convo flowed well, venue was great, some laughs were had, and then boom ghosted. I'm willing to bet the woman looked at me and within the first 30 seconds thought ""nope, not fucking this guy."" I feel like both men and women essentially know if there's going to be a second date within the first few minutes of meeting.

On the flip side I was once met with starry eyes and giggly smile. I immediately knew we'd be dating for awhile, and I was right.

2) I can't speak for other people, but me personally, honest closure closes it. I so wish people would just be honest for the reason of the 'break up.' ""Sorry your income and penis are too small. I just can't."" I would prefer that a million times over the cliche ""I didn't feel a connection, spark, chemistry, we didn't mesh.""

My OCD brain kicks into high gear wondering what the real reason is, and if I just knew, I'd be at peace. Again this is more of a 'me' problem than a dating problem, but still.

3) It sucks dating as a guy. I have to initiate the convo, ask her out, logistically plan it, pay for it, ask for a second date, then initiate any touching. The heavy lifting gets tiring after awhile.

I recently matched with a woman who lives an hour away. Guess which one of us had to drive the distance to meet?

I managed to make her talk more and now we're pretty much ""work-buddies"", we like to talk together, we always laugh at each others jokes and even end up having awkward eye contact sometimes. 

As we haven't worked together for long I questioned myself if she was just pretending to like me, maybe I was just annoying (I am pretty insecure about myself) untill she told me that she doesn't like that we haven't been put on (lunch)break together yet. I guess that would be a confirmation of her liking me?

Getting to the point, I really dont know what to do. We only see each other during the weekends so I don't know that much about her and haven't had the moment to ask her more questions as we dont have a break together. What im most afraid of is that she sees me as a friend, somebody she just enjoys spending time with during work while im having a major crush on her.

I’m currently talking to this girl that I met from a dating app 2 months ago. I honestly think I have feelings for her but I’m not sure she feels the same. I’m like emotionally attracted to her while she said she’s only “sexually attracted to me”. 

Now I’ve wanted to be exclusive for a bit but we had the talk and all she said is that she likes the way things are going between us but does not want to be exclusive because she cannot see herself dating me as of right now, nor is she actively looking to date anyone.

Since we’re not exclusive. Some other guy asked her on a date and she agreed, since they’re all from the same friend group - apparently he kissed her and made out a bit. She did say that he was really bad and I was much better than him, and it probably won’t happen again. *pat on the shoulder*

I’ve been getting pretty jealous recently, and I’m not sure what to do. I really like her but like idk how she feels. I’m gonna talk to her on Monday but is there anything specific I should talk about? I was gonna ask about the guy and whatnot.

I (21M) had a crush on this girl (21F) for about 2 months. I met her at a party after we made eye contact across the room a few times and she introduced herself to me when I walked past her. A day later, I slid into her dms and asked for her snap and she gave it to me. However, after I got her snap, I found out from a mutual friend that she had a boyfriend so I texted her infrequently just to get to know her better and talked to her at parties, but did not flirt with her. After a month of knowing her, I found out that she broke up with her boyfriend so I began to text her more frequently and flirted with her a little bit. For example, I asked her what she was gonna be for Halloween and she told me and I said that it was a boring costume for someone so interesting and she saved it in Snapchat. I was at a Halloween party with her and I flirted with her and put my arm around her and she flirted back with me because she put her hand on my chest for a few seconds, was comfortable with my contact, and shared a drink with me. Many Redditors agreed that she was flirting with me. 

I decided to ask her to dinner as friends because she just got out of a relationship and didn’t want to rush anything and make her feel uncomfortable. She said she’d get dinner with me, but added that she’s not looking for a relationship right now. I said that I understood and we’d get dinner as friends and she agreed, but the day before the dinner, she texted me and said that getting dinner together was a bad idea because we have different expectations and that we don’t get along that well. After she rejected me, I cut contact with her for two weeks except saying hi in passing. 

Then at my friend’s birthday party, I talked to her and had a casual conversation with her for 5 minutes and planned not to talk to her for the rest of the night. However, when I walked out of a room, she was standing nearby and walked up to me and started playing with my hat for not reason and I asked her why she was doing it and she said why wouldn’t I be playing with your hat. During this conversation, her face was really close to mine and we were making deep eye contact. My drunk ass really wanted to kiss her, but I decided to go for a hug and we hugged for a good 10 seconds.

Then, a few days ago she came over o my apartment to hangout with me and my roommate and she showed me a video and put her hand that was holding her phone on my hand. And a day after that, we were at a party together and she came up and talked to me and she fell forward a bit and I had to catch her and I kept my hands around her waist and back and she didn’t pull away.

Was she just using me for attention or just looking for a hookup and got scared off by my feelings? Is she attracted to me or is she only flirty because she’s drunk? Why did she say that we don’t get along that well, but flirted with me and initiated touch and conversation? How do I get over her? Sorry for ranting, but I just wanted to get it off my chest.

We've met back in 2016 but since we were both in school and our schedules were different we had almost no time for US so the only reason we've broke up was because of time.

In present days we are really close with each other - we talk for whatever we want, we text daily, we go out quite often, we sometimes cook together and play video games, when outside we always have amazing time together.

Well, as I've mentioned she is in on and off relationship with her boyfriend - I've told her that I don't really wanna know what's happening with them but from the things I know - he is really bipolar, selfish and arrogant. At the end of the day it's her choice!

Here is the thing - she is really emotional person. She listens her heart instead of her head most of the times - her last 2 break ups with him were her "" LAST "" but everytime he goes to talk with her - she goes back to him.

Last time this happend I was over with her but after few weeks I went out with a close friend of hers and she shared with me that during the last break up ( which was 2 months) my friend had thoughts to talk with me about a relationship since we are really cool together - ofcourse after some time passes, so she could totally forget about that guy and don't use me as a rebound.

I've asked her if that is true and my friend confirmed that she had these thoughts twice while not in a relationship with that guy.

But I have noticed more than one that the guy looks like they are just being fed up for being walked on. and people in the comments seem to be ripping them apart. 

while I don't agree with the ones who are jerks right from the start I wouldn't call them ""Nice Guys""  and and outside of that is where my understanding might me muddied a little bit. 

I tend to see some where the guys were actually nice and then when they get their hearts broken by someone they get bitter and upset because It happens to them time and time again. I wonder if I see those differently because I might be that type of nice guy I am not sure.

 I know once when I was a kid I was told by an older cousin ""Treat women like shit they will come running to you"" But the way I was raised I was always told to treat people with respect until they give you a reason not to. So for most of my life I have had 2 modes first you get my respect and I treat you with compassion and kindness and for some love. The other is you're dead to me and I am going to basically be a Jerk to you because you don't deserve my kindness or just completely cut ties with you and never speak to you again its not worth my time or energy(which I have done in the past). 

I constantly get told I am wonderful and I do nothing wrong from the women I date yet they break up with me. And from my married friends that I am ""fantastic and a great guy and they need to find me someone"" As I continue to get hurt, knocked down and repeatedly kicked while I am down there I am moving past being sad by it and becoming more angry at not the person themselves but the universe and myself. 

So am I misunderstanding the definition of nice guy because I might be one Or are the ones that stand out to me and I feel bad for are not necessarily ""Nice Guy's"" they just took out their frustration on the wrong person at the wrong time and it ended up in a post somewhere.?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1132824,public,self,"Am I misunderstanding the term of ""Nice Guy"" because I see they get a lot of hate",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r9nprl/am_i_misunderstanding_the_term_of_nice_guy/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,
