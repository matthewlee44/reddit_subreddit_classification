I've been told multiple times I'm very attractive by girls throughout my life. I'm tall, 6'4. Decent physique. (Go to the gym often) And have been able to pull some relatively attractive girls in person. **The experiment:** Me and 2 of my friends decided to see who could get the most likes/matches when signing up on tinder. The 1st friend had an account already and deleted it and made a new one. My 2nd friend made an account for the 1st time. The 1st friend is somewhere around Average - Good looking, and the 2nd friend is average.

**Very important things to note:** All of us posted not that great photos. Both of them have a shirtless photo mirror selfie showing off their abs etc, I don't. 1st friend included pictures with other people, on nights out etc. 2nd friend included a short little video with his dog. Where as I didn't do either and only had pictures of myself. We all only swiped on girls we found pretty darn attractive. We all kept our age and location range the same. (Default) Now finally bare in mind it's a Friday Night and they both properly set up their accounts and started liking/matching by like 7:30PM ish. I had set mine up and started at 11:00 PM.

**Now here are the final results by 11:59PM:** 

**Friend 1:** 22 Likes, several matches. Matched with several pretty attractive girls imo. I think some even messaged him. (Was a slow burner, took him 30-40 mins before he even started getting any likes, but started gaining them quickly after.) (Possibly used a boost, yet to confirm 100%)

**Friend 2:** 15 Likes, also got a few matches, but less then friend 1. Didn't check later how attractive his girls were, but he mentioned at first some of them weren't attractive at all. I believe one or two of them messaged him. Got about 8-10 likes within the first 20-40 mins of making his profile properly. Then was a slow burner afterwards, only gaining a few likes over the next few hours.

**Me:** 1 like while setting up my profile, with one photo that had already been added. 0 added likes by 11:59PM. (An hour after setting up my profile) 2 added likes by the time of writing this at 4am. So 1 like total by 11:59PM and 3 likes total now. 0 matches. I don't even know if the girl's that have liked me are attractive or not. I got a lot less interaction compared to 2 years ago, when I'm using better photos now (still not good though) and look better then I did 2 years ago.

**Conclusion:** Is this to be expected in comparison to my friends result's considering everything mentioned so far? I've never deleted the app, just my account, so is my app causing me to automatically get less likes/matches somehow - maybe something to do with my previous temp account, or to do with something else you reckon...?

Any advice/insight for going forwards is appreciated, as even for someone like me, this has definitely given the confidence levels a big ol knock even though I didn't expect anything impressive, this is still pretty disappointing so far haha",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1138575,public,self,Tinder experiment.

Its a pretty mundane job and its exactly what you would expect from a retail job, especially at a store in a mall that is heavily tailored towards the vast senior population in the community. I typically work with lots of older people with a few other younger workers who are around my age, but most people come and go, as you would expect from a retail job. As you can tell its pretty boring showing up to work in the same routine each week, with the same older employees lol (nothing against them tho! they're all honestly a very sweet bunch). Anyway, since mid to end October or maybe even November, we've hired a lot more people because of seasonal work needed in time for the holidays. So, one day, I'm walking through the store with one of my work friends (who's a couple years older than me -- I'm a university student to set the stage haha) and I notice someone new being trained at the checkout desk that I typically work at. And as soon as I come into view, walking past the registers, he looks up (pretty exaggeratedly) and holds complete eye contact with me the whole way past. I'm talking the whole locking eyes and staring the whole time as I walk past, and it's kinda weird to say this but, it felt like how they describe in romance books or movies, with the whole lingering first glance.

Anyway, fast forward, I don't see him anymore after this encounter and I guess I didn't have any shifts with him at all for like 2 or 3 weeks and I kind of just forget about him for this time. Then, I slowly start to see him again, but notice that he's been moved to another department (I later find out that this is because the friend who I was walking with during that first glance said she didn't want to train him because he was to ""by the book"", and let me preface by saying that my friend is kinda a veteran at this store and she's kinda goofy and slacks off sometimes but she gets the job done. anyway, back on track, he got moved to a department that she doesn't train in because she told one of the managers that lol idk it was weird, i'm pretty sure that was why he was moved). So, I start seeing him again but don't interact with him until recently, when I was put in another department that is connected to the one he works in because we were understaffed. So, he comes up to me and introduces himself and starts talking about all of this random stuff and basically stays there the whole shift and says that he'd keep me company since I hate this department and know nothing about it and that he'd help me.

Fast forward again, we start to talk a lot more and my friend said she notices how he acts differently around me and likes to be close to me and how he looks at me but honestly i'm pretty clueless when it comes to this stuff as i don't have a lot of experience in this area, i guess you could say. Anyway, one night he walked me out after my shift after helping me look for disposable camera film for my sister. It was at this time that I was gonna do something completely out of my comfort zone and ask him for his number, but of course I chickened out and just left. It was so bad that I was literally internally conflicted as I walked away and then walked back in the direction he went and then back the other way... it was a mess, but luckily he didn't notice and I didn't embarrass myself.

Then one night, when I was feeling risky after some drinks with friends, we found his instagram (i know pretty creepy and embarrassing) and my friend took my phone and followed him and I totally forgot about it until the next morning when he accepted and followed back. I was pretty shocked actually, I thought he would find it creepy as we had like 3 mutuals (and it was no one I knew personally), but luckily not. Only now that I follow him I feel like that was my wasted outreach to him and an indication for him to start a convo and dm or something, since I made the first move (idk again that sounds stupid now that I read it lol).

Anyway, I get back from my time off (i was visiting my friends in another town) and he asks how it was because he saw the photos i posted on my story (ugghhh kinda embarrassing but I gotta admit I looked good in those photos LOL). So, talking with him kinda feels normal again, until recently, I picked up a shift for someone and they placed me downstairs, faaaar from his department but when I came upstairs to speak to my friends, I noticed he was talking pretty friendly (kinda in the same way he supposedly talks to me), with another girl at work (who I've also never seen or talked to before lol). Actually, ew I feel like saying that is stupid LOL. So i'm a little bummed as I go back to my department cause I can't really talk to him today. But then I went on my break and I always sit at the VERY BACK of the eating area, like behind everything basically, cause barely goes back there and I don't rly wanna talk or interact with anyone during break LMAO, but like 15 mins in and I notice someone comes in a very noisily and exaggeratingly takes a set at the table in front of me. Guess who? It's him.

It was all very very weird, because he looked up at me as he sat down and my eyes kinda went wide cause I was surprised and he kinda just looked at me as if he didn't notice it was me?? Idk Anyway I was like oh hey ! its me! i'm actually covering for someone and working downstairs today! And then I walk over to him and we talk for the remainder of my break and it goes normal. Then as I leave he calls out to me and is basically like oh try to pop by my department i wanna talk to you. and im like ok ill try lol even though i probably cant cause i have to stay downstairs cause its busy

Anyway, as im doing my thing throughout the shift i kinda forget about it all and then im just helping a customer check out and he literally suprises me by coming all the way down to the back department that I was assigned to today! I was very suprised LMAO but obviously he couldn't stay so he eventually went back up. But it kinda just lifted my mood a little that he came to visit me.

Fast forward to the end of that shift and I come back upstairs to help the other departments clean like my manager asked and since my shift ended before his, I have to walk past his area to get to the employee room to put away my stuff for closing so I guess he notices me and- forewarning this will get a little awks LOL but he notices I'm leaving and we start talking a little like about stupid stuff (like oh how was working downstairs, did u get any karens LOL). and then he starts asking me when I'll see him next...?! but obviously thats more like when is my next shift and then as im telling him, he always does this thing cause im a lot shorter than him and he basically puts his hands on my shoulder or whatever idk but he does that and i think oh like hes just doing that thing he always does but then IDK WHY but he start bring me in towards him i guess and im like internally panicking like WTF DO I DO and then next thing u know i'm raise my arms and reach my hands onto his upper arms and he kinda pulls me into this weird side hug thing IDEK and then im like ok gotta go bye ! LOL internally combusting basically from this happiness??? i guess LOL ew im so giddy and mushy writing this

BUT basically to cut this short I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON, is he being nice? does he like me? IDKKKK can anyone more experienced let me know what is up hahah -- like these little gestures make me really happy but idek what im doing or what he is either LOL

Fast forward to a few months ago, he casually asked me out for coffee. I smiled at him, I saw his reaction like he was sort of thrilled. Then he told me about his breakup with our coworker. He said that he didn't want to go back to her. One of the reasons were that she was usually angry but wouldn't tell him why, and that he was not sure anymore if he truly loved her in the first place. As I looked at him during that day, though, I had no romantic feelings for him. I felt that it was just platonic, unlike how it was the first time I saw him. Maybe it was because I considered his past relationship too, whom he shared with someone we both worked with.

However, we had been in speaking terms since that day. He also got me a birthday present. Seems interested but I couldn't tell. Honestly, I don't know where this could lead to.

Something doesn’t add up. Plus, the first few times she was decent in bed, but tonight she told me she came twice and was tired and I didn’t finish. Which is unusual for me. Went at it for 30+ minutes. She also made no attempt to help which really turned me off, so I showered, said I was tired and she left.

At this point I believe I should just slowly retreat, despite her telling me that she wants to be my gf…we’ve only been seeing each-other for about a month (probably less)

This is a bit of a strange situation so please bear with me. I am a visual artist living in a large city. Towards the end of this year I was put in touch with a filmmaker who was looking for an art designer for her new short film that was wrapping towards the later half of 2021. The director and I exchanged emails about some ideas she had and she showed me the rough cut of what she'd worked on up until that point. I was blown away (saying that to say that I really respected her and her work). Before signing on to help with the film she wanted to meet. I live a few hours away from her so we met virtually first and it was a little awkward but things went well as far as a business venture. She agreed to sign me on, we talked about a rate, everything was fantastic. Flashforward to right before we've locked picture and I'm in her town. I hit her up and we agree that we should meet for lunch to talk about the film. We meet, we talk, it's amazing. The vibes aren't strange at all in person, but of course it's business so we're putting our best foots forward right?

Okay, so... flash forward again... Film is done, it'll screen at festivals in the coming year, everything is wrapped (yay!). We're still in touch, and I just so happen to be having a huge opening in her town so I've been in her city installing work for the past two weeks. She knew this and eagerly came by my studio last week. We talk about the work, some of her scripts, and she mentions we should go to a museum while I'm in town. The vibes are.... less business and much more friend. Of course I agree (she is quite attractive but again was previously a business partner). So, next few days go by, and we're off the museum. I'm taking photos of the work for reference later and she photobombs one and pops her head in, so I jokingly tag her in this hilariously silly photo on Instagram and she hearts it and shares it to her own story. At this point, the museum visit is giving straight up either good friends vibe, or like 4th date vibe (oh I forgot to mention she told me she was single during our studio visit, not randomly we were talking about life and stuff). 

Anyway... Tonight was my opening, and mind you, she'd already seen the work due to the previous visit but she showed up! She complimentated the install and said how much she loved was I was doing and as I'm ready to leave the gallery she says ""Hey I'm not doing anything right now if you'd like to hang out"". I'm of course happy to hang and really grateful she came through so I'm like yea! We go to a diner and I order my favorite drink and she orders.... the same drink. She was like ""it sounded too good not to get when you mentioned it!"" At this point I'm like ok, there's no way this isn't at least a little cheeky right? So I take a cute picture of the two drinks, tag her again, and she hearts it and reposts it. We have dinner and it genuinely feels like a date. The body language, the questions, all of it. I try ignoring it the whole time but I kind of can't. I ask if she needs to head home and she says no and that since the park is next door we should check it out. I'm like okay cool that's what I was gonna do anyway. We're at the park and we're drinking champagne and I swear it's like a romcom. Laughing, long stares, and right before I send her home there was a pause where we kept saying things that signified we didn't want to leave. I'd say ""well... even though I don't want to I should probably get back to studio"" and she'd say ""Yea, I've got a script to work on even though this is much more fun"" and it ended with a very very very long hug.

I asked her to text me when she got home, and idk if it was the alcohol or not but she texted me as soon as she stepped through the door and started sending HEART EMOJIS! I sent some back and then we were going back and forth ACTUALLY flirting via text until she went to bed.

Sorry for the lengthy and terribly boring story I just.... I just wanna know if treating her professionally until she showed her hand was smart or dumb because I so badly wanted to kiss her but I didn't want to fuck things up and now I'm watching Eldren Ring videos on youtube to get my mind off of how badly I folded 2 hours ago...

Gonna try to make this quick:

I (28) have been seeing/dating/talking to/whatever-you-kids-call-it-nowadays someone (29) for 4 months now. When we first met, we both agreed to go slow and really get to know each other instead of rushing into a relationship. That being said, I’m certain I’ve fallen for him and I’m at the point where I seriously could see myself working on building a future with him. 

A few days ago, he asked if I was dating other people. I honestly told him I wasn’t and he said he wasn’t either. Now, the topic of dating exclusively has been on my mind for a WHILE but I’ve been too scared to bring it up. However, in this moment, I decided to take the leap of faith and bring it up. 

But his response kinda left me feeling hanging.
On one hand, he said he’s been thinking about the same thing, but he wanted to make it special and talk to me about it during an upcoming vacation we had planned (which we decided to cancel due to the rapidly rising covid cases). 
I tried to continue the conversation, but he said he still wanted to create that special moment and asked me to wait until then. 

While this can be taken as a good sign…I’m still left kinda…confused? We never really decided on anything after that brief conversation and now I feel like I’m in limbo because he never really answered my question about dating exclusively. I think it’s also important to mention that we won’t be seeing each other until after Christmas for various reasons so I’m unsure when he’s trying to plan this “special moment” or if it’s just his way of stalling to avoid turning me down. 

I’m also confused why it needs to be some extra special occasion just to talk about *dating* exclusively because it’s not like I asked him to be my boyfriend. 

TL;DR: I asked a guy I’ve been seeing to date exclusively. He said he’s been thinking about it too, but held off giving me a definitive answer because he wants to “make it special/cute”, but I feel like I’ve been left hanging and I’m really confused and unsure how to proceed. 

Can someone please help me understand what the heck is going on please?

I started dating a guy who lives in another town (about a 2-hour distance). He works a lot, has a kid so finding time for me hasn't apparently been easy. We started talking at the end of summer and saw each other 2 times. In the beginning, he canceled 3 dates with me because he chose work. He said he is looking for something serious and even asked if wanted to be his girlfriend on the first date. I said we should get to know each other more first. On our second date, I let him sleep at my place and we had sex. He decided to live very early the next day because he received a message from work. After that, we continued talking but he did not make plans to see me again. He started to message me less and when I hadn't heard of him for a while I decided that we need to talk because the relationship wasn't going forward. So I messaged and he said that I could call him. We spoke on the phone and I asked him what he wants to do if wants to leave it or keep trying. He kind of wanted to know first what I think. I said that if we find a solution I could continue but if we never see each other than no. (I am planning on moving to the same city because I am trying to look for a job from the capital, more job opportunities) he said that he thought I was moving there a little faster. It's been difficult to find a job. We spoke about other stuff on the phone and in the end he said lets keep talking he will try to find time for me. So there was very little messaging between us and we haven't now spoken in a month. I only see him looking at my Instagram stories which probably means nothing.

Basically, if a girl doesn't have sex with you in 3 dates, assume she's using you for attention, or isn't that physically aroused by you.

I think this is actually a decent rule with some caveats. 

The biggest one being if she's actively dating other people. I'm not necessarily going to hold someone's past against them (they've given other people sex on the first date so they have to do so for me) BUT if they're actively dating other people, and they're making you wait 6/7 dates, then that's a red flag. 

It's emasculating knowing that the person you're putting in effort to woo is getting railed by someone else. I totally get everyone has needs, but I don't think I could properly trust someone who can date this way, even if its just the beginning. Its generally a good sign that someone is adverse to commitment (not necessarily). 

I know this post won't be popular, but try to at least understand from the guys perspective. 

I wouldn't mind waiting for a girl if we're only seeing each other or she's taking it slow with every guy she's seeing/not hooking up with anyone. Obviously no guy can know this for sure either way, but assuming they're honest when you ask if they're seeing other people it says a lot.

So really hitting it off with this girl I’ve been seeing for a couple months.

Should I tell her next time I see her? I feel I should give her a heads up on this. And at this point, I feel I should bring up *the talk* about being official. I really wasn’t planning on doing all of the stuff we did until we were official. I very much more than like her, and I can tell she does too.

But nonetheless, I had my feelings exploited earlier this year by a woman (25) who lived too far from me where the GF and BF thing became a thing, but unfortunately never materialized beyond that. From that experience (close to 3 months of development), I separated myself from what I suspected wasn't going to work out b/c I had asked if everything was okay and it was a vague ""Yes"" and as time revealed to me, I found out the hard truth the feelings she had for me other was anything but real; I did hurt some, but not to the fullest extent.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I realize that some of might be ""TL;DR"", but I needed to get that part out of the way to give an example after learning from that experience. I've been more self conscious and aware of what to look out for and now to the point of the title. I managed to have a long and civil conversation with someone in my local area which I'm grateful for. I told her what my hobbies are and the same from her behalf. She wanted to get the toughest parts out of the way to determine how far our conversation would go and I admired that. She warned me that she was a ""hopeless cause"" and that she had an abundance of mental problems from past times that still affects her in present time. After sharing with her that with all the stuff I have as a hobbyist, I would love to teach someone what I know and have that contribute to what would likely make us better friends in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

She was heavily intrigued and admired how I texted (proper grammar and sorts) and how descriptive I was which led to her to telling me that she felt she was ""out my league"" and what I do seems more awesome than her. I reassured her that comparing herself to me was not needed and not fair. We continued to text back and forth for 3 days and after the first, that was me texting her the next 4 times. From this point on, I thought I would let her be the first to text me to see how ambitious she was to connect further. It has been a week now and I haven't heard anything back which indicates to me that she isn't interested, ambitious, or more importantly, she is busy with work and other personal problems that she doesn't wish to trouble me with her own issues (which I respect whole heartedly).

&amp;#x200B;

For some reassurance, am I wrong for not communicating back further after not hearing from this person for a period of time?

So I am a 25M and I have had quite a few relationships, but I haven't been able to find the happy ending that I am looking for yet. Maybe reddit has to offer some wisdom and otherwise I at least got it off my chest.

As a background: until about 2 years ago I had a pretty serious relationship of in total 3 years, of which 1 year living together. I met her during the most difficult time in my life, I was recovering from a severe physical injury and was completely out of it mentally as well. After a rollercoaster relationship that ended as intensely as it started, I took almost a full year before 'getting back out there'. I have had 2 serious dating/short relationships since. Aside from those 2 experiences, I was chatting very intensely and for like 1.5 months with a girl that I went on 1 date with. This week, that ended from her side and I am actually pretty gutted about it I have to say.

Anyway, over this timespan I really grew as a person and also realized I wasn't being selective enough when it comes to looking for a partner. I was so happy if anybody liked me, that I went with it almost regardless. I know a lot better what I like in a women now. Especially the last two people I dated showed me what I need. In some sense a combination of their (to me) attractive qualities would do it. However dumb or corny that may sound.

Which brings me to my point. Judging from what I am looking for in a woman now, that's realistically speaking not gonna be easy to find I am afraid. Assuming that finding that is even possible, it's gonna likely take time and probably a lot of energy and near misses. I have noticed that dating is getting to me way more than it was before and every miss drains my energy. On the other hand being alone drains me too, I am never fully happy on my own. I think I have been single enough in my life for my wish of being together to not be completely unhealthy, but maybe thats wrong.

Anyway, I am not sure what to do the coming time. On one hand I think deleting all apps and just be single for a while makes perfect sense, but at the same time I have this deep wish to connect and feel like I just have to stick with it and ride the wave of the dating game.

So, that was my story.

Since few months my relationship with my boyfriend is over after almost 5 years of relationship. I'm obviously devastated and everything reminds me of him in the house where I live. I also feel like I have less energy when I come in here. I continue to associate the house with him and our relationship. I have considered moving, it will be expensive, but then I also think about the cats... I have 3 cats and I would possibly rent something smaller, possibly without a garden (they have a garden here). My ex boyfriend also wants to take over 1/2 cats. It breaks my heart that they would be separated from each other and that they might not have that freedom to play in the garden anymore. So I have heavy feelings of guilt, but I also know that I will not last long in this situation. I still sleep in our bed now and every morning I still have the urge to feel his pillow. Everything just makes me very sad here; which is a shame because it is a nice house with a nice neighborhood.

I was wondering if anyone has experience with such a situation; will moving reduce the pain? I find it so difficult to make a decision, but time is of the essence given that the rental contract needs to be adjusted…",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1138658,public,self,Change environnement after breakup?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rj7lo5/change_environnement_after_breakup/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

Don’t get me wrong, she is totally my type, absolutely stunning (model and mini-celebrity in her country) but this happens every time I develop romantic feelings for a woman, I lose my sexual desire for them… I do not know why this happens to me but it happened in my previous relationships before. We are a long-distance relationship (I met her online and we haven’t met in real-life yet) but we have only talked about sex blatantly one time because I thought we should have a conversation about it (since that is what normal couples do, right?) but it felt very bland since I wasn’t really feeling the passion and was just asking her about her sexual experience (she does not have any…).

When I masturbate or fantasize, I never think about her and if I do, I will lose my motivation or erection and be put-off. I still get horny and turned-on if I imagine and fantasize about other woman who I feel no romantic feelings for (these women are just random people online that I do not know and it has nothing to do with physical attraction, my girlfriend is better looking than the women I fantasize about, it’s just I’m not in a relationship with them and have no love for them). I also feel like a creep or pervert if I have sexual thoughts about my girlfriend and I feel wrong if I bring up sexual topics with them. I don’t think this is normal but this has happened before with two previous girlfriends (only have dated three women in my life, my current girlfriend and two ex-girlfriends).

Now for my two ex-girlfriends, I'll talk about my experiences with them when we were dating. With my previous ex-girlfriend, I also had met her online and never met in real-life but we dated for two years over the internet and only talked about sex a handful of times the entire time, felt the same way then too. As for my other ex-girlfriend (the first woman I ever dated or had a serious relationship with), I actually did meet her in real-life and had sex with her but she initiated it a lot of the time and I never sexually fantasized about her or thought about her when I was masturbating during the time we dated and the sex felt very unfulfilling and boring to me when we had it but it was okay-ish. I vividly remember kind of forcing myself to orgasm while masturbating to a photo in underwear she sent me because I wanted to feel ""normal"". I cannot really compare the sexual experiences I had with her to anything else since she was the only person I ever had sex with in my life so-far.

I do watch porn and I guess I kind of have an addiction to porn and masturbation. I used it for a long time to cope with my underlying depression. It's just sad that I'd rather spank my monkey to porn than talk to my girlfriend about sexual things or even sexting with her. I also feel like maybe she would not like it., even though she has given no indication to suggest so. It's just I feel like women do not like sex, especially with someone like me, so why should I bother or trouble her with my sexual urges (this is how my mind rationalizes it)?

I guess my view is not healthy but I feel very immoral, disgusting, and evil if I think about my girlfriend in a sexual manner. I think I am doing something bad and reprehensible. I do suffer from depression and low self-esteem. Been seeing a therapist for it to improve my social anxiety, depression, and learning how to control it. My social anxiety has gotten better but I’m not completely normal yet.

It’s not that I don’t love or have romantic feelings for her, I still strongly desire her company and always dream of going on dates with her, cuddling, kissing, holding hands, and spending our time together and lives, it’s just the sex stuff that I am having an issue with. I am pretty socially undeveloped and not good at interacting with other human beings. Trying my best to learn, though. How can I develop a more satisfying, alive, and healthier sexual connection with the women I am in a relationship with?

This year I started university and in my apartment block I met a girl and we fell in love. We weren't supposed to but it really clicked and we just couldn't help it. We've already done all the nice ""relationship things"" and we do have fun. And it's not even awkward or forced in any way. We study at the same university but at other faculties and we come from different cities so we practically have no common friends except the people in our appartment. 

Now she is 21 and I am 18 which is a pretty large age difference. I'm very lucky because I look older than I am (I look about 23-25) and I can act older as well so most people don't really know my age ( I had succes with older women earlier because of this). It really seems there is no age difference. But at the end of the day she is from 2000 and I am from 2003. I kind of feel it hard to overcome and don't really know how to live with it. Certainly because there is not really a easy way out for both of us. The relationship isn't toxic in any way although we both have our downsides, but even those are mutually accepted and we work together on them.

 (This is going on for about a 1,5 months now.)

Emotional vulnerability is incredibly difficult for me, and he hasn't had a romantic relationship in nearly a decade, so he's struggling with it as well. But I've been putting in a lot of effort to be clear with my feelings since Day 1. We get along very well, see each other about once a week and communicate by text or call nearly every day.

The only problem is: last week, we spent the night together and I told him that I really like him and that I don't want to see anyone else. I told him I wanted to delete all my dating apps (I haven't been active on them since we met, but it's just the gesture) and I wanted to date him exclusively. I know he's not seeing anyone else, nor am I, but he immediately got awkward and told me that he ""knows I want a relationship but just doesn't know if he has that much to give right now.""

Now, I'm not naïve. I've been dating long enough to know that means that he's just not that into me. However, his actions this week have been saying the opposite. He's on vacation right now but returning this evening, and when he found out that my weekend was totally booked, instead of going home tonight, he's coming straight to my place. He's been ridiculously affectionate and sweet, has been initiating more and more contact (I've backed off a bit — my pride was hurt when he told me he didn't want a relationship) and has been more complimentary and sweeter than ever. He hadn't told any of his family about me at all, but I found out this week that he's told his brother all about me, and was showing him pictures of me and even relayed a short conversation back and forth between us.

I'm at the point where I'm not in love with him yet, but it's getting there. One or two more sleepovers and I'm a goner. But this man is saying one thing and doing the other. I just don't understand. I know I have to talk to him, but is there a way to get the information that I want without straight up telling him that I'm falling in love with him? I think it might be a bit much, and I don't want him to feel pressured by the ""L"" word.

Basically my GF is a big Harry Styles stan and we somehow ended up talking about him.

She immediately said that she would break up with me in that situation without really giving it a 2nd thought. I thought that she was just playing around so I laughed it off.

But honestly it bugged me a bit (especially cause I've been recently thinking that she might be ""the one"" and I really care about her) so I talked to her about it. She found it weird that I wouldn't do the same and was just so casual about it. She said that I would definitely do it as well if it was my celebrity crush (I wouldnt at all lol). 

But honestly what bothers me most is how normal she was about the topic of us breaking up in that situation. I get that its kind of a 'jokey' question but I tend to overthink this typa shit.

We never talked before and I only ever seen her once before this. 

About a week after I saw her in the halls during while going to my next class and she smiled at me, and I’ve seen a few times since and she’ always gives me a certain look. Not a “please don’t f*cking come and talk me look”, but a somewhat flirty, inviting look. Now it’s probably nothing but I wanna try talk to anyways because I feel if I don’t try I’ll be dwelling on it 5 months from now at 3 am wishing I did something. 

but the thing is I never approached a girl. I’ve only had two other relationships with two other girls, but the build up to them was natural, if that makes sense?. With the first girl we had the same class and the other girl she was a mutual friend and started hanging out with my clique. So the relationships where organic and pretty easy for someone as introverted as me, and also I never actually initiated with those girls either. I’ve always been the quiet reserved guy in my group of friends, at least compared to my friends who are pretty “rowdy” let’s say and in both cases they initiated most the time.

But yeah, I wanna try and talk to her but I can’t find a reason to go up to her and talk to her somewhat naturally, I was thinking about dming her but idk, that seems just as hard to pull of.
