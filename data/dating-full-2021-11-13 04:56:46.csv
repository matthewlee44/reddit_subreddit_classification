The first 6 weeks were great - we got along so well, he was super emotionally available and he didn’t play mind games. Then our country went into lockdown.

The first month of lockdown was good, we FaceTimed everyday and then I started seeing his mental health deteriorate in the second month and he started becoming standoffish. The city I was doing lockdown in eased their restrictions after the first month so I can’t imagine what it was like for him. 

I moved back to the city where we live 2 weeks ago, since then I’ve seen him once. He’s happily gone to play tennis with his friends, gone out for drinks with his friends…made loads of time for his friends, but when I’ve tried to initiate a hang out, I get shot down. And he’s also been an asshole to me about his ex. The straw that broke the camels back for me was me deciding to give him a couple of days space because he was having a tough time at work and with his depression and when I did reach out last night, he wasn’t struggling, he was at a friends house having drinks. 

I don’t know him long enough to know if this change in character is because of lockdown or if this is the “honey moon period is over” and it’s the real him but I really don’t like it. He constantly says I’m lame which has made me self conscious and he’s referred to me as “damaged goods” on more than one occasion. And I don’t think he’s really over his previous relationship either which became more apparent in the last month. The fact that he doesn’t want to see me in person is embarrassing too.

So I (26f) met my husband (25M) in June 2018, we soon moved in together March 2019. We struggled with jobs and keeping up with rent etc.  so I decided to join the army in Nov 2019 to make it easier for us, and to also move us from our small state. The recruiter suggested for us to get married so the army moves us around. Since we were already together we just decided to go for it. Long story short, I found out he was talking to a girl back in our home state after we had left and I was stuck on base during COVID. I was upset I told him to go back to our home state and just leave me alone cz I planned to file for divorce. He went back and started dating this girl. I ended up leaving the army 3 months later due to other reasons, and I managed to get an apt in a whole new state and start my own life. However, the divorce had not been processed, and he was still trying to make things work. I decided to take him back and he came to join me in my apt about 2 months or 3 later. He started giving me bad vibes and always talked of how he didn’t like his environment and how he wanted to be with his friends back home. I got tired of it and told him to leave if he wants to- he flew back the next day. Few months later he came back, and we tried once again to fix things smh. But now, he is back to trying to move. I have finally found a stable job with a reputable company that actually lets me utilize my BA and MS. Even though it is remote, I am required to live within 75 miles of the office. I am not looking to move and I am happy with where I’m at. He keeps bugging about how he doesn’t like where we live and that moving to a major city will help him feel better. In my experience, it doesn’t matter where we move. He just likes to be around his friends so they can party and hang. So moving would not help, it would be the same vibes. Other issues such as him not enjoying our nights out after I nag for us to even go somewhere. Always complaining about his job, wanting to wait to have kids even though I was ready at some point- not any more- not with him. So our lease ends in 2 and 1/2 months. I just applied for my own apt and I have not told him yet. Our apt needs a 60 day notice and I’m going to put mine in tomorrow. I am so over his negativity and bringing me down mentally. I want to be happy, travel, enjoy the good money I am making now. I guess I’m not really looking for help, just how other people see my situation.

Oh and I had filed for divorce in June. Our 3 month waiting period ended and I’m following up to see how it can get finalized because I’m so drained by him.

Someone even said they would pay me if I just sent a video of me flexing. 

But a girl DM’ed me asking me for fitness advice. We hit it off quite nice and chatted for like an hour or two straight. She sent me a picture of her face and body pretty quickly, which was concerning cause I thought she was catfishing me.

We continued chatting and she asked for pics of me and I sent her them. We soon started exchanging shirtless pictures and she wanted to see more, but I didn’t feel like I could trust her like that yet. She had sent me more sexy pictures of her...and she really does seem real, even based on her past activity on her account. We talked about where we’re from..school...traveling etc. But I just don’t know.

She was a bit disappointed I wouldn’t send more pics and that I didn’t think she was real (I asked her if she could prove it). She then told me to keep the pics she sent me for myself and not to share it with anyone. Anyways, did I fuck up?

I have been on and off seeing this guy for almost 2 years now. We were kinda just fwb but I had feelings for him, he sorta did too. It was kind of a messy situation. He hasn’t always treated me the best. I really liked him though, he’s everything I could have ever wanted in a guy. 

So back in the summer I found out he was seeing a girl after me and him got in an argument and didn’t talk for a few months. At that point in time i didn’t really care since we didn’t talk anymore, I accepted it. Then something happened between them and he came back and started talking to me again. We hung out a few times over the summer and he said next time I’ll see him is when he comes home for Christmas (he lives in a different country for school) We didn’t talk for the past few months, both of us being very busy. I had this sinking feeling though that he was seeing this girl again. I messaged him today just casual talk, brought up him coming back home to which he told me he was indeed seeing that girl again. 

It really hurt to hear that and to have my suspicions confirmed. I told him that I’m happy for him but I’m upset because I’ll miss him. He said he’ll miss me too and that he enjoyed hanging out with me but us being in a relationship would have never worked in the long run. He lives 8 hours away in a different country for 9 and a half months of the year. Long distance is really tough to make work and I totally understand his reasoning behind never pursuing something more serious with me. It would have never worked out. 

It’s kind of difficult coming to terms with this. I envy this girl, she has what I want. I want him to be happy with me and not someone else. I felt really comfortable with him. I hate feeling like this :( I’ve tried to move on from him so many times because I know the distance has always been our biggest issue. But now I know it’s over for good since he’s found someone else. Anybody have any tips on how to heal and move on from this situation? Words of reassurance?

She messages me and says I put her through a lot. She also put me through a lot she broke my heart and left me in therapy for a year.

So basically he never stays just so I could come spend the night. I would just like to be a good enough reason for him to stay in the city. I don't expect him to stay every week, but I do expect him to stay at least sometimes. However, me staying the night doesn't seem to be a good enough reason for him.

Title basically. Im a guy(surprisingly..) and I really hate dating apps and what they have done to dating

Now that we have things like tinder insights and all it's clear that the difference when you are a guy or a girl is immense(it always was but a lot of people were denying it)

I started dating late(Im 24) because I did not want to hookup for my first time. Turns out at 23 I declined 3-4 sexfriend/hookups proposals already and then last year at 23 I gave up and did my first experiences with a sexfriend, which I do not regret.

Now I had sex with two women at 24. Thats pretty low in our time, but it was mostly volontarily for many years so I guess that's okay.

Im not a model but I think I look decent and I changed a lot recently by going to the gym.

I still hate dating apps,especially in the west or countries like mine(France) where trying to get a match is harder than finding a job.

At the same time most women find their dates by being on their couch at home so even if I'm trying to meet them directly(bar, parties etc) and I like the idea of being that guy that hits on them in real life(since so few of us can do it anymore, again especially in the west where its now difficult for several reasons) well it's not working much.

Im glad I had my first experiences last year(finally) and now that I am better with myself I really just wish I had someone to see, spend chill evenings with, discover new things etc.

Plus my career takes a lot of time and I just cannot commit to spend hours each day feeling desesperate trying to get matches.

For young men, dating is at its worst, I really don't know what to do if I don't like using apps. Its like you lose automatically.

Men in your early twenties how do you meet girls?

I don’t understand what aspect of my life is preventing me from getting girls. 

Everyone always says I’m the best dressed person they have ever seen I get so many compliments on my clothes on the daily even from strangers, I even had a stranger come up to me and say I’m in my own lane for clothing. I won’t lie my clothes are reps and fakes but nobody can tell the difference because none of the girls I talk to are even into fashion plus they pretty much look identical even I can’t tell the difference between the fake and real. 

Secondly some of the girls and guys I hung out with they always call me one of the funniest person they know. I even had this one interaction where this girl keep laughing at me for 5 mins straight and I wasn’t even doing anything and she kept saying I just can’t take you serious everything you do is funny. On top of that people say my personality is amazing and I’m cool guy. 


Thirdly, I’m a really goal driven person and always aim for the top. I’m a scholarship student for getting the highest marks in electrical engineering. I work out regularly at the gym although recently I’ve lost motivation as it just seems like whatever I do it won’t ever work out for me I will never get girls. I’m not the biggest guy but I did put on around 12kg and I’m 65kg at 5’10 which is an improvement although there’s still a lot of work to be done to get the muscle I want.  I also submitted an idea for a graphic novel for a publication company which got accepted but I now need over 5k to fund it for the illustrations which I don’t have the funds for but what I’m trying to say is that I’m on my purpose and have goals and everyone always tells me girls like a guy on their purpose a guy who has there own life outside the girl etc.  I’m even looking at making a song with one of my friends I want to go for a juice wrld style. 


Recently, there was this girl that I had the biggest crush on and  I really wanted to start dating her. It  looked like things were going great she would whisper on my ear that this song could describe us in the future (it was a romantic song) or make comments like I’m the only girl that can make you listen to juice wrld because what we have is special. And she wasn’t out my league, she had so many insecurities about herself that she didn’t even look at herself the way I looked at her she thought she was like a 6 and needed constant reassurance. She choose another guy over me despite saying all that stuff which hurt me so badly cuz she basically lead me on and I liked this girl a lot. I keep thinking what does this other guy have over me it seems like the  main Two reasons she choose him is because of his car and his ethnicity. Additionally, he’s kind of mean to her and ignores her at times which just makes me think girls chase after the bad guy. He even denied her a relationship and told her ignore me in a public setting because I don’t want people thinking we together yet she’s still stuck on him like glue. I obviously have cut her off. 


After all this I went to club with my friends to try and get over her. There was this fine girl and I got her snap but she never opened my message and left me on 5 weeks delivered. 

Afterwords I went back to the club and this girl asked for a dance and she was  grinding on me and kissing on me. But I didn’t find her attractive at all and it  was my first kiss ever. She wanted to sleep with me but I denied it got a few reasons. 

I realised I was only kissing on her to get   experience and to try and get over the girl I really liked. Additionally why does it have to be a girl that I have no interest in or find attractive  why can I NEVER GET THE GIRL I WANT was what I was thinking the whole time she was kissing me. Another reason I was even kissing her was because my dad just makes me feel like a loser because I can’t pull any girls. I denied to sleep with her and afterwords I try to go after I girl I found attractive and to no surprise I was shut down. 


What’s annoying is I just can’t get the girl that choose the other guy out my mind I was literally head over heels for her. I’m struggling to move on. Plus we spent a lot of time together even though we never went on a date. 


I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’m starting to think I’m ugly. You can dress the best but if you’re ugly you’re still ugly. You can be one of the funniest guys or be on you’re purpose but if you’re ugly you’re just ugly. I even set up a tinder, hinge and bumble for the last 2 weeks and I literally can’t get any matches my friends keep making lame jokes like you’re app is glitching anti no way you can get matches but I know the truth I’m just ugly. My friends are getting matches on a constant basis. 

I think I’ve just accepted that I will never be able to pull girls and will probably die alone.

I met this girl in YouTube video shoot where we flirted a lot. I asked her out and she said yes very enthusiastic. (I'm 18 and she is 23)

We went out on three dates and we were both very interested. I'm not a texting person so she kept texting me and I replied because we had something good.

I'm a really touch freak and hate touching others or being touched (like 50 shades of gray) after the 3rd date I texted her and explained my problem to her and told her that I like to try this with her because I think she is worth it.

Next morning I wake up to her text saying she only sees me as a friend doesn't want us to end either because she has fun hanging out with me. (This is considering she touched me flirty and sexually a ridiculous amount on our date before laying on my shoulders and hugging my hand entire way to her house.)

Now she keeps texting me and talking to me like nothing happened; but I'm too proud to talk to her like normal, So I have been stone colding her.

But I do genuinely like her and don't know if I should let go of her considering she is interested too.

There are mostly people associated to, cat or dog type personality. Most often, boys are associated with dog type personality, and girls with cat type.

Though I am a boy I generally relate to cat type  personality. I have several female friends but I found them nothing more than just friends. I have friendzoned many. But here comes this girl in my class. She is intelligent and beautiful.  
Actually she is more than that, or I am exaggerating it, I don't know. She never talks to me Nor I. 

We talk very rarely,
We are now friends over 3 years, and just talk when we meet no call, no texting, bot constantly in touch.

But, when I first whatsapped her with a hi, she just replied hello and blocked me, after few months she said me good morning I replied the same and blocked her again. This thing is going on till now. 

Every time we met, we behaved very friendly, I don't think any reason to block her. Nor I can guess if she have any. When I think of her~ sometimes it gives me butterflies in my stomach, sometimes I get anxious. But it feels so good, as if you are in a different world.

Now I don't no what she thinks, this is where I am stuck. If any girls here, could she tell me how do girl see this from their POV and what should I do. I don't want to lose her.

Edit:
The cat and dog reference is to describe me don't mind it negatively

 I don't know, it just seemed me right, I have a pet I didn't have any word to describe me. Sorry

Edit: she hadn't blocked me once.
        One time she will sent me a message then 
        After a few days and will then block again.
        In past 3 years she blocked and unblocked

I had a boyfriend when I was 15 but it was online and we only met up once. That was cool but literally nothing has happened for me since. It's a bit frustrating-- most people my age have had at least one actual relationship by now. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I take care of myself and have future plans and all, and don't think I'm too boring. A few people have had feelings for me but how it always goes is we talk for a bit and try things out &amp; they lose interest after a few weeks. I try to keep things interesting too, I plan cool dates, try to text back quickly, etc. Do my best to be 100% respectful of people's boundaries as well and take it at their pace, and don't unload tons of emotional baggage on them or anything. But it has never gone anywhere and we always end up as friends, happens with both men and women. I've met some of my best friends this way but it's disheartening.

So I guess my question is, are there things that just make a person just not interesting to others romantically? Is there something I'm completely overlooking here? Or generally what else can I do to be more romantically appealing? Happy to answer questions too if that'd help :) Thanks.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1125939,public,self,Can make all parts of a relationship happen except love,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qsylg3/can_make_all_parts_of_a_relationship_happen/,no_ads,0.0,,,

I started talking to this new guy on okcupid , he’s from my town and we live close by.
We both agreed we don’t want anything serious but he kept texting me so much and the entire vibe was relationship kinda vibe .
He also made it super clear he’s into me and likes me and I really liked him back . 
We’ve been on 3 dates and had sex twice. Sex was pretty good , I believe he very much enjoyed it . 
We cuddled a lot and was very relationship like . 
After a month and a half he started to fade away, I tried confronting him , told him I felt confused cuz we didn’t talk as much and he just said he’s been super busy but he still likes me and wants to continue meeting up .
Eventually we completely stopped talking and it was over with no further explanation. 
Sometimes I see him at a local bar but we just ignore each other. 
I just wonder how come he ghosted me like that after showing this much affection and reassuring me he definitely likes me.
Felt super disappointed since everything was going so well…
What to do yall think could be a possible explanation for this? 
And should I try to reach out to him to try and get things going on again? I really liked him.

I'm 31, m, and never had a proper relationship.

I've had a few runs where I've been seeing someone for a couple of months but it's just fizzled out.

I'm an outgoing, sociable person with a good circle of male and female friends. All in their own relationships btw.

I am msc qualified in a professional career where I'm paid an adequate market rate. Similar pay bracket to most of my peers so no worries there. Not wealthy as such, but I'm certainly not struggling for money.

I have a wide range of hobbies, I keep fit, and have one thing outside of work that I've worked hard at, and in which have reached a good level. I'm now working in a creative project in my spare time,i don't waste my evenings lying on the sofa watching TV (although I do have down time as well).

As an aside, I'm led to believe I'm very attractive, even though I don't see it myself. On two occasions this year, women have called me over from the other side of the street to tell me how handsome I am. I get a feeling this doesn't happen to many men, so it makes me believe I must be pretty good looking. But I would never let it go to my head. To add to this, I'm 6'1"", which to my understanding is pretty much the perfect height.

But on dating apps, I get almost no matches. And when I do go on a date, they almost never go anywhere. This is despite my social skills and my supposedly good physical appareance.

When we are alone she is very thoughtful and loving. We have an excellent relationship. We laugh so much, cook together and I can tell she loves me deeply. We click so well.

The thing is she's addicted to make attention and pretty much indirectly admitted to me, she is always looking for male validation.

We walk around she locks eyes with every guy especially if he's average or good looking.

At a Halloween party she was trying extra hard to get my good looking friend to acknowledge her. She says she wasn't flirting just being ""the life of the party""..

She also always kind of disregards me in social events and definitely puts her self first. If we are going somewhere it's almost like she subtly doesn't want me looking good.

Thing is she's open to therapy for other reasons and doesn't really deny her attention seeking behaviour. But doesn't openly talk about it.

Is this worth working on? I know everyone here is more on the cynical side with relationships but nobody is perfect and maybe she can be more self aware and work on herself.

I put so much effort and planning but then the problem is that as soon as it actually works, my interest declines drastically to the point that I feel that I’m trapped because I put so much effort that it’d be weird to cut things off with the girl for no apparent reason. 

For context, I am a 25 year old male, I’ve been in love before and had a girlfriend for 3 years. But before and after that it’s always like this. 

Can someone help because I don’t want to be this way, and the issue for me is that I just realise afterwards that I was more interested by the challenge and not by the girl herself. I genuinely think every time that the girl is amazing and that I actually like her but it always ends the same way. What’s worse is that I end up being on bad terms with the girl because of course I handle the situation badly since it would be so weird to abruptly say that I’m not interested anymore.
