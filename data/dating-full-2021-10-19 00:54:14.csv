I do consider myself reasonably attractive especially in the face department and do ok on most dating apps.

1) I am extremely short for where I live (western Europe), the average male height is 1.85m while I stand barely at 1.73m . The average height for women in my country is around my height aswell. Height elemenates a lot of potential possibilities since most women want their partner to be taller than them, I also have to compete with men who are much taller than me.

2) I am 20 and only recently lost my virginity. Most women around from my age seem to view the lack of sexual experience as a red flag. I do not know how widespread this belief is but a lot of my female friends have said so. I could also simply lie about my previous sexual experience but I believe this to be a bit unethical.

3) People from my ethnicity, particularly males are seen as quite unattractive at least by conventional norms. My home country is also quite poverty stricken and has a very negitive reputation. I also do not know to what extent this plays against my favor. I regularly interact with people from a lot of different countries who tend to be quite open minded so this may be a relatively minor issue.

I did not come here to whine or socilit pity for my situation. I just want some honest opinions on if it is reasonable to spend time and resources on dating or to just give up. My time and energy is limited and I'd rather not waste it on something that is bound to not yeald results.

After that we just studied all morning and he didn‚Äôt bring it up again.

The comments had lots of guys confirming they had experienced this as well. They all said they had also been given free upgrades and special features to stay on the app.

This then clarifies the totality of Tinder's business model:

1) Pay male models, celebrities, and Hollywood looking men to stay on the app by awarding them all the bonuses and special features they can provide.

2) Use these men to lure in women, who will likely also not pay for anything, but rather use for free.

3) Use the women to lure in normal and average looking men, who will then have to pay just to be seen by the women or stand a chance of even a conversation - **this is the only source of Tinder's income**.

Is this not the most fucked up rundown? I always knew dating apps were fucked up. I didn't think it was anything so deliberately warped. I always thought ""women are the bait Tinder uses to make men pay."" But that's just one layer. There's an even bigger layer of baiting happening above that. 

The 6'+ white male models they are paying to use the app are the primary bait and the women are secondary bait.

‚ÄòOk idk how to fully explain this so I‚Äôm going to give it my best shot - 

I (18F) have a best friend (18M) whom I really really love (platonic) but BUT but I (think?) I‚Äôm at a stage where I‚Äôd like to date someone even (mostly) if it‚Äôs casual and really we‚Äôre very compatible imo. I have had feelings for him in the past (it was a very short phase and I told him and we moved on and anyway that was too early in our relationship).

Last night he asked me while we were playing one of those talking card games - ‚Äúif I asked you out right now, would you say yes?‚Äù. It was so out of the blue - but it‚Äôs not like I hadn‚Äôt thought about it before. The time I told him I had feelings for him, he didn‚Äôt want to do anything about it and then I examined my liking towards him and realised I wouldn‚Äôt really want to date him?  

Anyway, the point is, I said ‚ÄúNo, because you‚Äôre a bro now and there‚Äôs no coming back from that‚Äù or something like that without missing a beat (????) and now I am reconsidering it; because although I‚Äôm not crushing on him currently, it‚Äôs definitely not hard to see myself with him. We‚Äôre one of each other‚Äôs closest friends right now and genuinely I spend sooo much time with him already. Plus I am slightly possessive over him and like honestly I would be upset (inwardly) if he was dating someone else rn and not in the jealous way but just the ‚Äòbest friend dating someone‚Äô way? Idk how to explain and idk if this is a problem/toxic?

My reasoning is that we could just try it out and see how it goes, take it very very casually. Because I already am very attached to him and he is to me as well I think, and I genuinely think if we stop dating, it wouldn‚Äôt ruin our friendship simply because like clear cut whatever?

Please helpppp should I even ask him about this?‚Äô


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

A few things I‚Äôd like to mention is - I think at some level, if not at an obvious one, I do have feelings for him that are not platonic. I wasn‚Äôt able to admit that to myself in yesterday‚Äôs post.

I talked to him about this last night andddd he said he wanted to try something like this out as well. And it wasn‚Äôt awkward or anything BUT idk what to do know like idk what I‚Äôm supposed to be like? Do I just let everything stay the same and not force anything?

We matched on a dating app months ago and randomly met up a little while ago. He is attractive, has a great job, and is super smart.

I can't stop thinking about it though! I feel like he is some dream man and that I don't deserve to be with him. I can't get over the fact that he is much smarter than me, went to a better school than I am, has his life together and is somehow still interested in spending time with me. I am spiraling down a tunnel of what-ifs before a second date. I also am feeling bad that I just didn't reply to him asking to see me again.

About a year ago I met a girl in one of my college classes and there was an immediate connection. We just hit it off and everything seemed to be going well.

Fast forward to present day. We‚Äôre still great friends and she is an amazing person overall. She‚Äôs kind, thoughtful and so caring towards me as a person. We talk frequently and get together from time to time. She knows I still like her and is very considerate of that. She doesn‚Äôt talk about her boyfriend around me. Obviously I try to remain content in my role and making her happy is all I want to do. I‚Äôve kept myself open to other girls but I just haven‚Äôt hit it off with anyone yet.

I always hear about how women who are struggling with fertility issues should avoid being around pregnant women or ones with newborns and even told that it‚Äôs okay to miss baby showers and such or ignore pregnancy announcements. They are encouraged to just ‚Äúno‚Äù to these things and not put themselves in situations where they may be exposed to triggers. Okay so why can‚Äôt the same logic be applied to a girl who‚Äôs been trying very hard to find someone she can have a meaningful relationship but just has had the worst luck possible but then looks around and sees she‚Äôs one of the very very very few who has this bad luck and everyone somehow found someone that works for them and makes sense in their life? 

I recently declined my cousin‚Äôs wedding invitation (who‚Äôs the same age as me) and used work as an excuse because I honestly don‚Äôt think I can hold it together. I‚Äôm happy she found her match but all I keep thinking is wtf why or how haven‚Äôt I?? My sister who‚Äôs 2 years younger has been in a relationship for four years and my parents are happily married too and I have stopped going to family things where I am the 5th wheel, like I‚Äôm just fucking over it. I want my person too! I deserve it! Honestly everybody does. 

Sure I‚Äôm probably isolating myself by avoiding everyone since everyone is coupled up, I don‚Äôt have any single friends or cousins, it‚Äôs just me. But honestly I prefer this to torturing myself in social settings and bringing myself to the point of crying even. I‚Äôm tired of feeling less than or less valuable because for whatever reason nobody wants me. Let me say that I don‚Äôt actually feel this way about myself but when I am around couples it triggers these thoughts for me. 

I do sometimes think about why I‚Äôm single and I take some accountability. I am very picky, I‚Äôm aware of this. But I‚Äôve seen even some of my pickiest family members miraculously find their match and it‚Äôs amazing because it gives me hope but just hasn‚Äôt happened to me and like I said, I‚Äôm sad about it and getting impatient. 

Also for those who are going to suggest I stop being so picky. I have, three times with three different guys, 2 of them were pretty long term too. It didn‚Äôt work out. I always had the weird feeling in my stomach where I knew they weren‚Äôt what I wanted and honestly, the relationship turned toxic because of my uncertainty and inability to reciprocate.

Because of this types of man, women become indifferent to nice guys and go for the guys that show the most character. They go for the guys that ooze charisma and have the 'open book' type of personality. Women see them as being more genuine than a guy that is just nice.


My issues with that is that the face that a guy shows doesn't necessarily indicate his true character, especially when extremely charismatic guys can still be just as fake. Or they can put on charm to get closer to women.¬†

Super involved with school work and had little social activities with friends outside of school. Never dated during high school actually; I did have a date to the prom, wonderful night that ended with a hug and silence days after. I felt rather dejected from ""romance."" I yearned for reciprocation, but I became indulgent on the idea of being alone for good, not with resentment but with contentness. That void of contentness was poured with the countless interactions online on message boards and chatrooms. Some times such loose connections became temporary flings that eventually lost its lust when realizing I was trying to have 'relationships' with other lonely people whom shared similar feelings of despair. Late night chats weren't really out of love for each other, merely mutual pin cushions, stabbing each with our poor mental states. 

It's easy to trap yourself in your own world of sorrow. You read endless articles and watch video after video related to mental disorders, trying to find ways to figure out the faults and how to possibly fix or cope. No, this is not a ""mental disorders are not real"" kind of statement, but simply how someone like myself 'grew' into a poor state of mind without professional assessment while functioning in society. 

I had to remove myself from certain people and literal places to give myself time to process. The chaos from those that make your life miserable stifles positive growth. If you face some kind of toxicity, know that the longer you dwell with it, the longer it will take to start the healing process, even when you make the effort, the choice, to get out of dreadful headspaces. 

For those that struggle to find that special person, you find yourself in these subreddits, I'm just a little reminder that there's no magical spells or words of wisdom that will instantly conjour yourself into that ideal relationship you seek. It's simply a matter of time, luck, and the right place. For some, it's easier to find, for others, longer. When I finally took a seriously tough, psychological decision to move out of my parents place, unsure if it was the right move, it definitely took time to reflect and talk with others with more heart. Many nights sometimes left me laying on the wooden swing bench of the university I was attending, wondering what the hell was I doing? When I will find the happiness I want? 

Over time, I just let myself grow into my own person, let loose from the heavy influence that held my mental well-being behind. I pushed myself to interact with new people, meet them at various social functions. Even if such friends were temporary semester/class friends, I figured I would eventually meet good friends, or even someone worth dating. I simply had to learn how to be social despite it going against what I used to be; shackled by ones cold thoughts, sitting, laying, waiting. 

Despite never had dated early on when most did, it was simply one semester where I met my current Fiance√©. I cannot really give advice on how to ""woo"" your special interest, as yes, there's the basic social game, but beyond that there is the nuance that pairs with their interests, goals, hobbies, etc. The tricky part is seeing how much these qualities line up between two people. Sometimes in can be apparent real quick, and other times it may take some time to really get to know the other. Luckily for me, she was my ride home from night classes. I did not have intentions of dating but simply making a friend. Our conversations ranged from humorous, personal, and everything in between. The more we spent together, the more I felt attracted to her. Three months later we were officially dating. 

Now, over three years later, I have been living that happiness. We both love exploring new places, trying new experiences, and also know how to have our separate hobbies while being supportive and encouraging of each other. We feel like teammates that we can always rely on. 


This was very long winded, I know. I mean for this text to hopefully reach to someone that wants and may need to hear beyond ""it will get better.""

For me, what helped the most, as I mentioned prior, was to first change your environment.

It's weird because the chats will go well and I'll meet a guy in person but then he doesn't ""feel a connection"" to me. 

I used to think it was bs, so I started waiting and telling guys I'm waiting before going past 1st base. Then it still happened where guys even chatting on the app with me will ghost me and I'm back to square one. 

It was the same on bumble and tinder, and it was annoying because at least on tinder I could tell myself it's because they're just out with another girl that puts out. If I had slept with them I would tell myself they just want to fuck as much as the can in one lifetime with as many girls as they can, it's about the thrill of the chase for them. But when I guy I haven't slept with just says there's no connection, it makes me think it's me after all. 

How do you mean, no connection? You seemed pretty connection when you were sucking on my neck earlier. And then after when you were rubbing your hands all over me, and then when you spent the next 3 days texting me nonstop. So what is it? You just found something better? The girl you really wanted finally texted you back? Or were you just faking it to get laid and then you felt bad you'd be wasting my time?

But then I had it happen to me where I was the one who didn't feel it. I've been talking to this girl on snap for about 3 weeks or so. I swiped on her because one of her pics on tinder was really cute but I was never really all that into her. We chatted for a bit, did a video call where I helped her with school, then the weeks started to go by. 

I just don't feel it for her. The more we talked the more I realized she isn't my type. I didn't think I had a type, but I'm just not into her personality. Maybe that's what the guys who say it to me feel. It just confuses me because I get showered with compliments from them about how good I look or how awesome I am, how sweet, how hardworking, whatever.

It's rough and it's discouraging. Idk what to do anymore. I don't think I'm ""trying too hard"" I just want to get to know someone that I'm attracted to, see where it leads, make sure we're on the same page with what we both want abd possibly start exploring bodies.

Well, got over the hump of the first date and I think it went pretty well. We went to a fairly casual cafe/Chinese place (when I originally asked her out I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to take you to get lunch or coffee‚Äù and we never really specified which one so I just went to a place where we could get either lol) and talked for a little over an hour with hardly any dull moments.

Funny thing is this ‚Äúfriend‚Äù asked her to go to Vegas and she was hesitant to tell him no. She admitted that her ex and one of her girlfriends thought that there was something there between them. 

Another thing: we discussed her joining me on vacation but getting a room next to me a few weeks ago. Today, I get a call from her out the blue asking if we are still on because she had a male ‚Äúfriend‚Äù ask her to join him on vacation the same week. I asked her why didn‚Äôt she tell me this before. Her response? ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a popular girl!‚Äù She‚Äôs 50! 

Now, she wants to have sex with me on Saturday (heck no!). I think she passed that issue on to me but claims she is clean. It started after I kissed her.

I (21 M), was talking to a guy (m 25 let‚Äôs call him Ed) for about 3 months. I should preface this by saying for multiple dates we were pretty romantically charged(making out and whatnot), we were pretty engaged except when he would text on his phone randomly which I didn‚Äôt think much of. After a while he started saying he loved me and I felt the same because we made a strong connection. I pop the question 2 times if he would want to start a relationship. He said both the first and second time he would have to think about it. But after the second time I asked I went to his car after we arrived at a food place and saw it there he had sent a shirtless picture in grindr.

I then just thought leaving then and there. When I told him what I saw he didn‚Äôt deny it and claimed it was for some fun and that he uses it to make connections. Now my expectations or what I think of them to be is when you start getting romantic or use the word ‚Äúlove‚Äù that carries the idea you‚Äôre exclusive and some heavy weight. Which I told him about and he brushed it off. After we got food I didn‚Äôt talk to Ed for 9 days until I reached out again and he asked why I wasn‚Äôt talking for a while. 

I made it clear I felt like I was a side piece and that I felt it was kinda of disrespectful that he was just sending pictures to other men while saying he loved me. He countered with saying he didn‚Äôt mean to offend me since he using love pretty loosely with a lot of people and that doesn‚Äôt mean we are dating. I told him that with that understanding we are in two different places and that we need to just be friends then.  He then says that‚Äôs fine and asks if we can still cuddle and kiss to which I said 
‚ÄúEd, I don‚Äôt hate you but I sure as hell do not want to get physical with you
I reserve that for people who want me and I don‚Äôt even cuddle with my friends‚Äù
Which I felt like he wasn‚Äôt even listening to me.

To which I get a lot of guilt ridden texts about how terrible he feels and that he wish he knew sooner

I know I should‚Äôve spoken up earlier when we were going on a bunch of dating what I wanted in terms of a relationship. I don‚Äôt even know what I am supposed to feel after this point. He was telling me how terrible is he feeling  and I feel really torn about how I handled but I also feel that I needed to stand my ground with him. He asked me if I would consider him when it came to dating when he was ready and I wasn‚Äôt sure how to answer him.

I (24f) have been seeing a guy casually/fwb for a few months.

His job and lifestyle also does not give him much time to give a girl he would be dating. 
I want to go out on dates and meet new guys with the potential of a committed relationship but I also don‚Äôt want to risk ending things with the guy I‚Äôm seeing now. I guess it stems from being afraid of ending up alone if nothing pans out. I would also feel bad to any new guy I would be meeting if I‚Äôm still seeing current guy.

I went home and drunk texted him asking why he didn't want me to stay and he said ""you've only recently broke up with your bf and I want to give you the time you need, also I don't know what's appropriate and what is not""

I need to air this out. I recently fought (M 26) and got away from my ""relationship"" with a girl (F 25) with whom I dated for almost half a year, the reason for the fight was because I asked about the status of our relationship for the third time. 

After a brief reconciliation, I found out that this girl has an open relationship with a boy who previously gave her money and things that she needed. Also she said that she didn't wanted to have a relationship with me because she didn't know if I ""was worth it"" to leave all that behind. I always told her that I didn't liked open relationships and asked her kindly to always be honest with me.

We practically behaved like boyfriends and she constantly told me that we were almost boyfriends, that she only had things to think about. Sometimes she even bring up the topic of moving in together and having children one day.

It bothers me very much that she did not tell me from the beginning that she had this other person so that I could choose whether to stay that half a year or go with someone who does want to have a serious monogamous relationship with me.

I know that I shouldn't expect anything from anyone and that no one owes me anything, but I just feel very annoyed that she didn't tell me her real status and that she expected me to fight that other guy to ""show"" her that I was worth it.

Most of my dating experiences are pleasant, and just fine, but it just feels like going through the motions. It feels incredibly rare to meet someone that I feel genuinely excited about and gets my heart racing, and that I go to sleep thinking about and wake up with them as my first thought. In previous occasions, it‚Äôs not quite been instant but I‚Äôve felt that pretty quickly, and there‚Äôs just something indescribable that catches my attention and pulls me in. I can‚Äôt describe the aspects that caught me in this way, so I don‚Äôt know what to look for. I try giving connections time, but I just always feel like I‚Äôm wasting mine and theirs after a certain point. I also lose faith more and more everyday that I‚Äôll ever feel the ‚Äúspark‚Äù that I‚Äôm craving. Maybe it‚Äôs a feeling that you become immune to over time, and have to build something in another way. 

I‚Äôll be honest, the spark hasn‚Äôt ended well with others, otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt be in this predicament. So maybe it‚Äôs not something I should chase, based on past experiences. It‚Äôs just that I fed dating now is becoming devoid of feeling for me, I‚Äôm just going through the motions and trying to find someone where I can feel that real, exciting connection with.
