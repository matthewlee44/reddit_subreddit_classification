I’ve paraphrased and editing a comment below which I had posted on someone’s post, because I thought others might like to see what my personal experience was. 

Follow this time line:

Sign up on the app - you familiarize yourself with the entire thing - by the time you’re done signing up and posting the profile, you’re excited to get to swiping - so you go to the part where you get to swipe - you swipe on 10 or 15 guys that interests you, you get to read their profiles, look at their pics, they’re all nice - go to your inbox -  67 likes/winks/nonmessage  interests and 23 messages - you’ve been there all of 20 minutes. 

Now, you want to message some of these guys who messaged you already back and you never swiped on them so you have to look at THEIR profiles to determine if you want to message them back or delete or block them, while 22 more messages are coming in. 

An hour later you’re exhausted and the ones you swiped on are still 20 messages away, IF they messaged you as soon as you swiped. If they message you tomorrow, forget it, you won’t see their message for days unless you hire someone to read and respond/delete to all the incoming messages 24/7. 

This is why you don’t hear back from me on apps (assuming I likes you) I might LOVE you, but I can’t find you in this attention maelstrom I’m drowning in, and just processing this comment is hard, imagine how it is to slog through these messages.

I’m taking a break from the apps currently and I apologize here publicly to anyone who sends likes/winks and that type of thing because I literally never get to those non messages interests. 

Again I say: Outliers aside, but if you’re a good guy like most, and have a nice ad and don’t hear back from a lady, it’s probably got NOTHING to do with you at all.

my personal (male mid thirty) experience is that women my age react quite harsh, when men date younger. And I don’t even talk about really young (40-20), even if I as 36 male would date a 25-27 year old one, from women my age there would come pretty bad feedback. Especially if I am looking for a relationship (casual sex would be more ok). From my perspective that age (also up to 30-32) is a good fit, when it comes to starting a family (not immediately but in the next years…). If I would just would like to fuck around that would be „not good“ but far more tolerable for them as to say „I am looking for a women with an age at maximum up to 32 to start a family“. The classic answer is: „That’s unfair you are 36 you should also consider older ones“ Even that I have to focus on the ones my age is sometimes an outcome.

That comes from all kind of women, women that know me well or not really,that are in a relationship or not…. To be frank as soon as they are in their thirties (and i normally don’t tell like exact the „end dating age“) they get really pissed when it comes to, „looking for a younger one to start a family.“ And i always explain that I am looking for a real partner, with a real connection. I find that confusing.




Explantation of that age range that I am looking for, just to be clear: I want 2-3 kids, I want time to know and develop an meaningful relationship with my partner before getting kids. Money is not a real problem, but it would be important for me to have a wife that could work as well to have something on carrer and personalside as well. I myself were several years really focused on career (maybe a bit too much) and needed the time to develop as person and man ( had a long term relationship of 10years that cracked because we were not able to get kids.). To be honest my main point is just biological if I want 2-3 years before first kids and then 2-3at all, it will be rough with a women my age.

I’ve (man 20)been on a couple dates with a girl (20) and when we were together in real life we had a good vibe going. She also suggests we go do more stuff when we are together. But when I ask her when she is available over text she always says she’s busy, it’s annoying but normally doesn’t  form a real issue because she usually tells me when she’s available in 1-2 weeks. So at first I was fine with that but last time I texted her after we talked  about what we both wanted from or felt for eachother (we both weren’t really sure yet), she only stated she was busy and didn’t let me know when she would be available (not totally sure if that has anything to do with it but i could imagine so). I also want to meet up more often now that we both stated what we want so we can actually learn what we want. I don’t really know what to do now, should I move on, wait or try again next week? And if so any advice on how to approach the situation going forward?
Thanks in advance.

I think I mean well when I say FWB doesn’t work. 
There is a disconnect with the experience men and women have. It makes sense for adults of consenting age to just lay out their intentions and expectations from the start. 

My buddy and I talked about how some men (if it’s not you, relax…it’s not an attack just an observation) explore FWB to fill a void in their lives where they cannot have a one night stand easily. It looks advantageous to men who perhaps are not lucky to have regular sex outside a relationship. 

What’s unfortunate is the lack of communication and the perception that a magical adventure can happen effortlessly. It’s a time investment, it’s calculating distance travelled and match schedules. A person, you’ve never met beforehand is not likely going to be a perfect match logistically. 

The level of possession is also indicative of that the man in question is not living in reality. A man who can’t handle a loss and is possessive should not be in a casual relationship. FWB can be terminated at any point for any reason because you two are not committed. A woman can decide you’re no longer needed and just move on. 

She has options…you don’t. Don’t like it? Change it. Is it easy? Never. 
Wanting exclusive NSA sex and no commitment is a recipient for disaster. It’s not for you.

I’m not stupid. I don’t want to treat anyone I’m with like they’re stupid. 
I notice people are lead more by emotions and social pretences than logic. We also fool ourselves into thinking we’re excellent communicators. We’re terrible, we don’t talk about what needs to be said…it’s all blah blah blah. 

If you don’t express what you want out of FWB it will fail.
If you don’t feel personally responsible for your own actions FWB will fail. 
If you walk into this situation disregarding the other persons needs or expectations FWB is not for you.
If you’re sensitive and insecure….FWB is not for you. 
If you are scared of being alone FWB is ….hold on…wait for it….not for you. 
If you don’t tell your fucbuddy you have romantic feelings for them FWB will fail.

You can’t have your cake and eat it to. Dating someone long term is better. Yes it’s vulnerable and scary but hell it’s the same for the other person. Worried about getting hurt? Damn did you know you can cause harm too without trying to? I guess we all vulnerable out here.

If you don’t walk into this with some good faith, it’s gonna be painful never attempting to change your circumstances. 

There is a lot of hope for one night stands and asking a woman on a date. #1 benefit is you don’t have to change. 
All you do is become aware of yourself and act accordingly. Be courageous. Stop adapting and overcompensating. 

Self awareness and acting in accordance to your values and….letting the fuck go will make you happier 100%. It may lead to better relationships. Just don’t shut off your brain and ignore chances to be introspective. Know yourself and experience the relationship you want!

We never met in person, but it has been very promising. We usually responded to each other in less than a minute, and talked every time we have some free time (morning, lunchbreak, evening to late night). 

I'm pretty serious and willing to move on to the next level. I wanted to ask her out on a date but during the past months there has been a lockdown where I live. The lockdown was just over this month. So I planed to ask her out for a dinner. I kept stalling for weeks until I could gather all my courage and asked her out two days ago, she simply said yes.

a little bit more of background, my job currently permits WFH while hers does not. Her job also relatively more stressful, exhausting and she always had to work overtime for a few hours. And for some technical reasons, she had been working even harder recently. She was exhausted and I assumed she was also stressful, because she didn't even want to talk about the job, while she normally liked to talk to me about that.

Now, what happened today was: I had been triggered by some personal issues and became emotionally unstable, sensitive, so my interpretation skill was definitely not at 100%. We talked about some general stuffs and then I reminded her about our date. She said ""I'm free. A little bit lazy but I can go"". That was the start...

I must mention that as I'm posting this, it's already late night where I live.

Being overly sensitive, I played myself a big time. I misinterpreted that she was tired and need some rest. I even partially thought she didn't want to go out with me. I'm a person with ZERO confidence, I have been trying to improve but achieved yet. So yeah, I took that personally and I was really down by that. I stop texting for a while, and then decided to express my frustration. After that she went mad at me. She said she had had a very rough day and I was being a dick to her. She even went as far as saying she wanted to stop chatting with me, in a very serious manner.

I tried explaining her about what I misinterpreted and how sensitive this stuff is to me, I also addressed that I am fully aware what I did wrong and honestly sorry about that, but I reckon that's not good enough for her. She explained how difficult it was for her to make herself free on the date day. She also said something like ""after a bad day, I expected you to be there and support me, but instead you did this"" and ""If I hadn't known you, I wouldn't have felt this bad"". I tried to ask if she still wants to leave, but all I got were obscured answers. I finally promised her not to do it again and asked for her apology, she said just stop. 

And that was the last message, we stopped texting a big while. Then I just texted her goodnight and she just kept that read.

And there is no definable standard on what constitutes working on yourself, and how good is enough. Work on yourself and be confident is as useful advice as saying ""don't be depressed"" and ""work hard and one day you'll be rich."" 

However, I'm currently trying to craft a theory on how to solve these issues, so I need help here to confirm them:

First of all: You're never good enough, you're dealing with people that have various standards, being rejected doesn't mean you're not good enough, it means you're not good enough for him/her, it isn't a personal attack to you, nor does it mean you need to keep going up and try again.

Second of all: Confidence in dating is a lost cause, results will indeed be against your favor, I think when people say that you need to have to better yourself, is that you need to find something you're good at, and try to create some pride out of it. It'll make you happier about it, when you do these things, don't think about dating at all, focus on trying to keep happy about the evidence presented here that you're good at it. 

Third of all: Brace yourself, the time commitment hurts, what you need to focus on, is less about the result, and more about what you're currently doing, because odds are that you're failing anyway. Sure you want a boyfriend/girlfriend, but the time you're taking to talk to them and knowing them should be a something you should enjoy enough to want to do again regardless of failure/success.

I should also mention that general hygiene is important because nobody wants to be close to a disgusting person, regardless of how attractive you are, and you should be clean anyway because you shouldn't spread diseases more than should.

Also we slept together for the first time on the fourth Date. 

Since then its been 2 weeks and we didnt see each other. We texted the day after (i texted him first) and also a week later (again i started it). When we said goodbye after our last date we kissed and i asked him if we should meet again and he said yes.

I am so confused right now. Has he lost interest? why is he not texting? I am guessing if he was interested enough he would make an effort to see/contact me. What do you think? 

I would like to text him but it makes me feel a little stupid at this Point.

Not too long ago, I took the risk and asked him out and he very enthusiastically said yes--and last weekend we got breakfast and walked around town for around 3 hours. We were relatively touchy (I usually have a wide personal space bubble, and we brushed against each other almost constantly, stood touching each other/leaning into each other, etc). We seemed to get along really well, and he even tagged me on his social media (I did the same for him, which is very unusual for me, lol). At the end he told me he wanted to see me again the next weekend, to have drinks with him and his friends.

The thing is that we didn't kiss, which made me doubt everything. To be fair, I could have initiated the kiss myself--but I was so nervous! 

We haven't talked that much over the last week (he's told me he's having some family issues--the country he's from and where his family lives is in a lot of turmoil right now, so I believe him!) but we made concrete plans, and tomorrow I'm going to his place to have drinks with him and his friends, just like he said. 

I guess I'm worried he now just sees me as a friend? I have met partners' friends early on before, but that combined with no kiss makes me feel like maybe he just isn't into me.

I had a substance problem the last \~6 years with both weed and cocaine, where I would get super stoned everyday and the few days I actually went out with my friends I was coked out of my mind, and usually just being an asshole or stupid to listen to.

I been clean now for 6 months, and despite my heavy recreational use over the years I've taken a pretty decent education, bought an apartment and have a great job earning more than most people in  a prestige company. 

My problem is that I often have 0 things to talk about with girls when I finally meet someone at nights out/parties.

I met a girl from college at a train station, I helped her with her ticket and we rode the train together. We had met briefly before, and I immediately thought she was attractive, but during the short trip we really started to get on well, bantering back and forth and having fun. When we got to college we exchanged details, and said we should definitely meet up.

Jump to two days later, and I text her asking if she'd like to go with me to an event nearby the following day, to which she said yes. We met up, went to the event, ate food and just had a great time. We laughed quite a bit, and I definitely felt like there was a good connection, we have loads in common. At the end of the date we hugged and she said we should do it again, to which I replied the weekend would suit well.

And then disaster struck. I got sick, and had to postpone the date to the following Wednesday, to which she replied ""Of course, sounds good."" Unfortunately it got to Wednesday, and I was still under the weather. But I waited. 

Every conversation up to that point was initiated by me, every date proposed by me. Clearly I was interested, but I wasn't sure she felt the same. So I waited. And......no response back. No ""Hey are we going out?"" or ""Hey, feeling any better?"" There has been no contact since.

Now this kills me, because I really felt we had something good, as brief as it was. Some guys I talked to said I did the right thing to test the waters, but some girls say that it might have looked like I blew her off. That my illness (despite all real) could have been misinterpreted as an excuse to get out of the date. Did I blow her off? Did I, in my attempt to see if there was a connection, accidentally destroy any chance of having one?

We saw each other again in Aug 2021 when work reopened and he became my boss. One tuesday, I approached him after work about potentially leaving which lead to bigger and deeper conversations. we ended up talking for 3 whole hours. Just STRAIGHT UP TALKING. After that, we spoke and texted more and more in and out of work and realized how well we vibe and how we share so many similarities.

I’ve learned many things about him, the good, the bad, the important etc. like I know now that he SUCKS at texting, which i’ve found a way around even tho it sucks ☹️

We’ve hung out outside of work a few times but so far, nothing “out of the ordinary” has happened. You’d think we’re just friends hanging out. 

But also, there are things that (at least to me), I feel as though he wouldn’t do if he JUST wanted be friends. He’s also the type to say it like how it is so if he wanted to stay away, he would have said. 

Recently, I’ve been thinking more and more about where this is headed. While  I understand you shouldn’t be hanging out with people JUST to date them (because i’m glad we connect even at a friendship level), I’m curious if he’s planning to even make a move AT ALL. I’ve heard from his friends that he seems to “not looking for anything serious” which saddens me a bit because I really want us to be more than friends.

Idk if he’s not wanting to take any further steps because he’s still technically my boss, or because he’s still emotionally guarded and not ready, or because he really isn’t looking for anything serious, or MAYBE because he doesn’t like me as much as I do to him but all I’ve done today is overthink this relationship. 

And I know i’m in no rush; it’s not like I have a line of suitors waiting. But I also feel like I wanna know if I’m waiting for something that might not happen (i know thats not how life works but yknow).

I wanna ask for those reasons but I also don’t wanna seem like i’m rushing or that “I WANNA BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND NOW”. I’m aware sometimes you gotta take things slow. I guess it also doesn’t help that he might not work at our workplace in January so maybe I can wait until then?

In August, I started talking to someone [28M] on Discord that lives in the same state as me. We’ll call him Discord Guy, or DG. DG and I met through a mutual interest in the Big Buck Hunter arcade game. We were talking in PM’s and he said that he was going to meet up with a friend at a Buffalo Wild Wings to play (all 3 of us live in different parts of the state but the towns are not particularly close to each other). I decided to join them after work. I thought this friend of his would be a guy but it turned out to be a girl, and an attractive one. We’ll call her New Girl, or NG. I found NG more attractive than my former crush, with whom I had a complicated yet kind of intimate relationship with even though she was taken. NG and I talked for a bit but we didn’t have any really deep conversations. She had to leave a bit early because it was a Monday night but DG and I stayed a little longer at the BWW. I messaged her the next day after finding her on Instagram (I also added DG on Instagram) saying it was a fun time and she agreed. I would be seeing her again that Saturday, but not in the romantic sense.

On Saturday, I went to a bar in New York City. They were holding a regional competition for Big Buck there, and NG and DG were there. There were 2 tournaments, one for newcomers and one for the pros. NG competed in the newcomers tournament and DG and I both competed in the pro tournament. NG was pretty excitable that night and she was physical with me quite a bit (which has made me sort of aroused) and was also excited at taking pictures with me. One of the guys that was there told me, on his way to the bathroom, that this girl was into me. However, she was also kind of physical with my mother and stepfather and with the president of the studio that makes Big Buck. She might have just been drinking a bit too much which might explain her actions. I know for a fact that she is single (I asked DG if she was dating him) and her Instagram posts do not suggest that she is dating anyone, but she gets really excited whenever she sees me.

Fast forward about a month and a half later (about 2 weeks ago at this point), and I was in Chicago for the Big Buck World Championship. My mother and stepsisters (my stepfather’s daughters) were there too for support. All 3 of us (me, DG, and NG) competed in a bracket of 110 people over the course of 2 days. NG came in 100th place, DG came in 86th place, and I came in 5th place. The reason I was able to rank so high is because I had much more experience with this game than either of them did, but we all still had a fun time. I took more pictures with NG and I also got her number (I believe she gave it to me; a lot of stuff happened that night and there was a lot of excitement), as well as DG’s. She seems to care about my family a lot because she wanted to make sure my mother made it back to the hotel safely (the venue of the tournament was within walking distance of the hotel).

Today DG texted me saying that he and NG would be going bowling tomorrow and they would be playing Buck Hunter there. I am strongly considering going since I will be free from work this time.

Just so we’re clear, even though DG &amp; NG hang out with each other a lot, they’re just friends. NG has said that she’s not dating anyone, and although she and I don’t really text a lot we still have a connection with each other.

I am thinking about asking her out, and I have told my therapist about this. He thinks that I should ask her out, and he wants me to do it before our next meeting (in a little less than 2 weeks from now). I’m not sure if I should do it over text or on the phone, but I think it would be pretty weird to do it in person. Even if this doesn’t go the way I plan, at least I’m making an effort to put myself out there and get over my ex-crush.
