this is my experience with the most recent guy i casually dated , who has a serious case of “nice guy syndrome”. 

I was very honest and clear with my intentions of not being in a relationship right now (especially not after only 1-2 mths of knowing someone) , he agreed even though he genuinely wasn’t okay with it. that was the first mess up. 

he felt like he had to lie about multiple dumb things . for example, after sex one day he told me he lied about being a virgin. he also lied and told me he was okay with me dating other people . this really came to look really bad on his part.

Nice guy syndromers often have a serious lying issue . The image that they’re trying to create for you doesn’t match up with who they really are , so get used to the constant lies and validation grabs. 
example of a validation grab:
“are you attracted to me?” “am i better at sex than your exes?” etc. 

these are also stemming from insecurities . so with the whole “nice guy” thing they will literally do anything for you to cross your boundary of either 
1) not wanting a relationship w then 
2) not wanting to have sex w them 

Expect an extreme amount of love bombing (especially with materialistic things or honestly ANYTHING monetary) . i was getting dinners at least 2-3x a week a month into seeing each other . i also met his sisters and his best friends within that same month. He hasn’t even met one of my friends yet.

He is trying to rush the relationship before you notice any character flaws or red flags . then after that point you feel obligated or “stuck “ because :

“he’s bought me all of these things “
“i already met his family” 
“his best friends will wonder why we aren’t together anymore!” 

another thing: the nice things he does for you are often because he wants to improve how you view him and not genuinely because he wants to do it with no obligation. 

ex; i remember one time he invited me out for dinner . once the check came he goes “it seems like i’m having a habit of paying for your food” and made me pay for my meal. if that’s the main issue here then why invite me ? 

the answer is simple: after all of those dates he invited me on, seeing that i didn’t want to be in a relationship with him made him slowly begin to feel “used” . a “nice guy” would never invite you to dinner and then complain about their offer and insinuate you don’t pay for your food any time. He started to think that i NEEDED him for each and everything.

he also became too enmeshed in my dating life and questioned what i was doing even though i had been completely honest with him this whole time .

last straw was when i said i wanted to be friends last night because he lied about being ok with me dating. that’s when the fake crying antics and the “so you’re just gonna throw everything we have away?” guilt tripping and the “you’re just stressed “ gaslighting . he did a 360 to the sweet “nice guy” i previously met into an emotionally manipulative person I lost respect for .

this was definitely a lesson for me, people with nice guy syndrome have deep-rooted insecurities and feel the need to display a mask/straight up lie in order for others to view them in high favor . almost as identical as a narcissist. and i’m sure many nice guy syndromes do have narcissistic traits",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163548,public,self,the reason why most “nice guys” tend to finish last (at least in their eyes),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tdvzp4/the_reason_why_most_nice_guys_tend_to_finish_last/,no_ads,0,

To put it simply, I have a coworker who I find attractive, funny, and fun to be around. But for some reason when some of our other coworkers bother him about dating, he just doesn't like to talk about it.

He's currently trying to move out of Illinois, so he says he doesn't want to focus on dating if hes going to be moving and he doesn't want to date someone if they would want to stay in Illinois.

Now I guess I can kind of understand his irritation at being annoyed about dating, one of our coworkers is kind of a jerk about trying to get him to date. 

Now me and this one coworker get along fine, we have the same hobbies, both love the outdoors, and he also appears to be the type of guy who i could count on if SHTF. 

The only thing that might be weird is the cultural difference. I'm currently trying to get my US Citizenship as I'm originally from Mexico. And he's straight up cornfed midwest white boy. Thats not an issue for me, but my family however is kind of weird about that.

I’m 27/F and perpetually single. I have fearful-avoidant attachment. Most of the time I lean fearful, but in the early stages of dating (first few dates, talking on apps) I’m definitely more avoidant. Before anyone tells me to see a therapist, I have one and I’ll talk to her about this next time I see her, but that’s not until next week. 

I tend to lean towards liking guys who give me less attention. It’s easier for me because I feel less pressure. I prefer it. But I’ve had more than one person tell me that maybe that’s why I’m still single, because I’m rejecting the guys that show interest. But it feels like TOO MUCH. It feels like obsession and it feels like I’m being suffocated. Why do you need to talk to me so much? Why do you need to send me messages that look like an excerpt from a novel? Not to say I don’t like hearing from people I’m dating, because I do, and I even like a good back and forth throughout the day, but if it hits a certain level, I feel like I need to run away. It’s overwhelming. 

I told a discord friend that if I ever went out with a guy and he asked to see me the next day (or even 2-3 days from then) I’d bounce, no matter how good the date was, because that’s just too clingy and needy for me. Same if they ask me out too soon after we match and start talking. 

All that being said, I also want commitment relatively early. I’m ready after 3-4 dates/1 month. I’m not in it for fun or to go with the flow, and once I decide I like someone, that’s it. I don’t feel like there’s anything important to learn character-wise after that point. Of the boyfriends I’ve had, I never learned anything about their character after that point that I didn’t already know. 

I don’t tell any of them that, because I know that would probably be “too soon” and I’m willing to wait a long time if I like the guy. I just let him take the lead. However, I haven’t gotten past five dates with any of the guys I’ve gone out with since I started dating again in Jan 2021 after a five year break. I rejected most of them after one or two dates. Anything that went past that, I was rejected. I only went out with 8 guys, which feels like a lot but I guess isn’t? I didn’t like anyone else enough or feel comfortable enough with anyone else to accept. 

So I guess I want to know what a normal/appropriate level of interest is in early dating. I know that nobody can really say what “normal” is because everyone has different preferences, but I’m becoming aware that my preferences aren’t even close to normal, so I’d like to get a better idea of what is.

I’m currently in a relationship that I am not sure if I belong into. I know that sounds weird. So a little about myself. I’m 28 years old and prior to the one I’m in now, I’ve only been in one that lasted two years. I was in love during that relationship but we broke it off because I was moving to another state. 

I stopped dating from the ages of 22 all the way up to age 28 (now) until I entered this new relationship. 

Here is the issue I am running into that makes me feel absolutely horrible inside. If she were to break up with me today, I don’t think it would bother me. The weird part is I want to be with her but I’m not sure if it’s for the right reasons. When I was first shown who she was in photos, I thought she was gorgeous and beautiful but come to find out she used a lot of filters and makeup because when I first met her in real life, she has severe acne on her face, neck and back. It kills me inside because I don’t want to think like this but it always does. I don’t have that strong physical attraction because of the acne but then when I see photos of her I do. It’s so screwed up. Her personality and loving ways however are amazing. She really is caring and so loving. Almost rare to find these days. The issue is I’m so scared I’m abusing it because of my own insecurities of not wanting to start over anymore especially in todays dating world. We have had sex three times and all three times wasn’t great but it wasn’t horrible either. I don’t want to call it off because I’m scared I may never find someone so loving like her. I’m also scared I may be forcing myself to stay in this relationship because I dug myself to far in and I fear how much it will hurt her. Her backstory is so sad and she even told me she was going to give up on relationships before meeting me. 

I don’t know what to do. I really do want to make this work and love her but right now i don’t have that desire to want to hang out all the time or even have sex all the time. 

I’m such an asshole. I let me insecurities take a hold of me. I found someone who loved my insecurities but it may have been wrong for me to do so. Now I feel like I deserve hell for all this.

The situation is a bit complex so I will try to break it down to the best of my ability and try and keep it crisp. I am a 31 year old male coping with chronic anxiety and a bit of depression history. I have been really shy at interacting and I don’t usually talk much. Over the years with family feuds and marriage frictions in my family, I was too scared to peruse finding a partner for myself. However I have liked a few girls in the past where I have tried to reach out. 

So one of these girls who I was interacting with last is single again, I kind of disconnected after I figured she was seeing somebody. She has had her own bunch of mental health struggles so she had turned me down for that reason. I don’t blame her she has the right to pick who she wants and what works for her. I am in great place mentally though I have my occasional set backs. I have been reading a book on CBT by Christine Wilding. I kind of really liked this girl, she is quite talented at what she does and she is so nice too. I want to check with her if there was something off putting about me but I am not too sure how direct I can be and I want to do this without disrespecting her and without causing any mental trauma about this.

I am in the process of moving abroad to study I am waiting for my student visa to come through (fingers crossed). So I just want to get to know how I can improve my self if I am lacking somewhere. I have also been reading another book “Designing Your Life” by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans - I want to have the essential love and partner segment in my life at some point if I could find the correct person (I am quite picky and terrible at keeping up with people if they relocate). With this girl I wish I could really find some connect and have her to share my life with. I am making some effort to live a healthy life I will always work on improving myself. Even if I can’t be with her I would still want her to be happy just as I want to be. 

Looking for some suggestions and advice from peers who have seen all the ups and downs, if someone could weigh in it would be super helpful!

So I rely on my weekends to have a bit of social life. 

Several months ago, an old friend of mine reached out to me, after we lost touch for 2 years because of our studies. We had a bit of a tumultuous friendship (we successively had a crush on each other while we were teens, we went out together for a month but we were too young to make anything out of this, so she ended the relationship but we remained friends).

We reconnected very fast, and we started to hangout on many 1-on-1 activities on the weekend (seeing movies, visiting museums, or just sharing meals). I would be lying if I said I wasn't falling back a bit for her, but I value our friendship a lot, especially since I feel a lot of ambiguosity in our hangouts, but I don't act on it yet because I value our friendship, and we're gonna be 10 mins away from each other after my internship.

Fast forward to yesterday, we were supposed to meet for a meal in our favorite snack bar (I don't know the term in English), go see the new Batman, and then hangout in a park with a very famous tree she always wanted to see. I wasn't hungry, so I took a simple, small meal. But after 10 mins, while we were chatting, I started to feel very full, and having nausea. I excused myself, asked for the bathroom, and puked there while she was waiting at our table. I then explained to her I wasn't feeling well, while I was panicking. We walked toward the theater, but I wasn't getting any better. So I told her it wouldn't be possible for me to go on with our hangout, and I apologised profusely. She accompanied me to where  I live, before going back to her uni.

While she was very comprehensive and tried to reconfort me, I can't help but feel ashamed for ruining her day (because we met in the center of the city, she had far more travel time than me), while I feel like I made a fool of myself, and ruined any romantic atmosphere there possibly was between us. Hopefully, as I was apologising she proposed to reschedule our hangout to the next Sunday. 

Right now I'm in my bed, promising myself I will enter an ascetic diet until next Sunday. I still don't know what made me sick (I doubt it's overeating, and it wasn't intense enough to be food poisoning).
I've rarely felt as vulnerable and awkward as yesterday.
How can I manage the aftermath? Do I just act as if nothing happened?

It's not that I idealize her I realize there may be more suitable people for me than her somewhere but I don't have access to all 7 billion people on Earth only to single girls around my age looking for relationship and inside my social circle which is very small so my options are really limited and maybe I should lower my standards.

I tried going out with some girls I don't feel much into a few times but whenever we are talking and they don't get me or don't seem interested in what I'm interested in I just automatically remember my conversations with my ex. I realize that connection/understanding take a while to develop but people interests don't change and if they aren't interested in what I like dating them wouldn't change that fact. My ex shared my interests and from the first time I talked with her, she just liked all my topics, understood them and seemed to see ""inner me"". If I tried to act ""uninterested"" in her for some initial attraction, she could see through me. It's just that she understood me in great details even from the first few times we meet and this doesn't happen with other girls.

I don't compare personality or looks I just compare happiness I don't feel much happy with the girls I see or at least it's far lower than how happy I was with my ex. Maybe second/third love shouldn't burn as much as first level but how much should I compromise ?

I don't have a checklist or specific standards, if I try to imagine what I feel attracted too I guess fit girls with big beautiful eyes but it's not a hardcore requirement actually my ex had big eyes but was also a little overweight and had large frame but I didn't care at all because I felt deeply connected to her and I saw ""myself"" in her I didn't care about finding someone prettier or if she matches my value I feel she was just right.

But now when I try to lower my standards for personality and feelings I feel my standards for looks go up and maybe I don't match what I want so that got me wondering how much should I lower my standards ? How much should I expect ? Should I just date/give a chance to anyone that show interest in me and hope I develop feelings for them ? if so how many dates till I decide I'm not into them ?

For context I am 25 year old male who lives in a fairly active city, works out 3 times a week and works full time shifts within the city and it’s surrounding areas.

In the past 3 weeks I’ve spoken to 3 different girls and tried to go on 4 different dates.

All 3 did not reply on the day it was supposed to happen. All 3 left me out in the cold.  They have unmatched within the day after if on tinder. 

It’s not difficult to rearrange or just say you’re not feeling it, I’m never going to force the date to happen I’ll just get on with it. 

1 of them did this twice and then the 2nd time said “are you mad at me?” With a winking face. I said no “I’m not mad but don’t talk to me as this is the 2nd time now you’ve let me down and I’m now not interested in meeting you.”

I try to stay positive about it but honestly it’s really starting to get to me,the one last night really got to me as well. I worked a full night, the night before and did not get to bed until 10 in the morning and stayed at my parents. I then got up at half 3 in the afternoon to have a roast with my family and then rushed from there to my place to go for this date, I would rather have stayed with my family for obvious reasons but all the indications were there that this would have been a date that was going to happen. I text to say I was there and then nothing, I waited for 20 minutes and walked around for a bit until I was sure it wasn’t happening. I then went to have a drink on my own because I didn’t want to waste the time I had spent getting ready and going into town in vain. I ended up befriending the people who work at a pub I normally go to so a silver lining there.

I am 16 years old and last year I got a job which is my first job ever, i quickly got promoted and things were going very well until around 6 months ago when this new guy started working with us. He is one year younger than me and at first we weren’t very close as our relationship was strictly work related but later on I found out that he likes me. I did not feel the same so I decided to keep our relationship the way it is but he kept on trying to get closer. He has a history of using drugs and other substances and I simply did not want anything like that in my life at such a young age. He kept on asking me for a chance and from the beginning I was open with him and I was honest and I told him that I don’t see us being together and I don’t believe that we’re good for each other, however he does not take no for an answer and when he doesn’t get his way he’ll keep asking until he gets the answer he’s looking for. I slowly began to feel pressured into giving him a chance as he would always tell me about what he’s been through and how he’s struggling and how I’m the only thing that makes him happy. I decided to give him a chance but told that it does not mean that we’re officially together or dating. He started spreading rumours and lying and telling everyone at work that we were dating and other rumours. I confronted him about it and he just lied and said that he never told anyone anything. I was never happy when I was around him because I always felt obligated to be there I felt like I had to. One day I told him that I can’t do this anymore and that I don’t think that we should be together but like I said he doesn’t take no for an answer. I tried to talk to him multiple times and tell him that I can’t be with him but he threatened to k**l himself if I ever left him because “he can’t live without me”. It was always about him even when I was having a bad day and told him that I didn’t wanna talk he’d make me feel guilty by telling me how he has it so much worse than me. Every time I tried to talk to him and tell him that I wasn’t happy with him he’d have a breakdown. My friends say that he was faking it and he’s just manipulating me but I simply couldn’t just walk away as I was scared that he’d do something to himself. Until one day when I had enough and told him that I can’t do this anymore and just left. Since that day his friends talk to me everyday and tell me how he’s not going to school and he’s depressed and he’s relapsed because of me. When I’m not around at work he acts normal but the second he sees me he changes and he stops talking and acts like he’s going through depression. There was rumours that he was talking to other girls when I was with him as well. He texts me everyday asking me for another chance and he tells me how he can’t do this without me and I told him to move on because I don’t wanna be with him. I simply don’t know what to do. I don’t want to be with him but I feel guilty.

Things were going so well it was great. He was affectionate, kind, made time for me (we hung out every few days) and I felt comfortable around him. 

He was sending me super sweet text messages full of emojis and hearts and we started talking about relationships and such. It was kind of assumed that’s where both of our heads were at, it was too soon but that’s the direction we were going. He wanted me to meet his mom and friends (he met my mom just to say hi) and was just a great guy. He seemed like the guy I had been waiting for. This was the type of person who I wanted to be with. I thought it was finally going to be my turn to get into the relationship I pined for. 

And then from Saturday to Sunday it felt like I was talking to a totally different person. He ignored me for most of the day and then when he did text me, he only responded to one message (I sent like 4 total texts from previous conversations). Super dry text, made no real effort and when I asked to hangout he wasn’t as enthusiastic as he normally was and didn’t even give me a straight answer as to whether or not we could see each other (more of a “I’ll let you know tomorrow” type response).

The director in my school linked me up with a student (23F) who had done the same scholarship in the same school to help me with the paperwork and the process.

I hit her up and she was extremely helpful. In fact, she's been the friendliest person I've ever met till this moment! Our convos were about the scholarship at the beginning but we branched out to different topics about common interests (which were quite a few) and things each of us was working on. Sometimes she would vent out about what her grandma's behavior and other stuff, and I'd vent out to her as well. Our convos were full of heart reacts, which I don't often use with girls lol. But she bombarded my texts with those and so did I cuz I didn't wanna seem rude.

I started catching feelings, I felt safe and that butterflies feeling whenever I received a text from her. She was an hyper active texter, she'd reply to my texts immediately. TMI, we only met in person once when she wanted to give me some spanish book. 

Based on that behavior I assumed she might have some feelings towards me as well but I was second guessed my assumption, what if that was the way she treated all of her guy friends only cuz it's her friendly personality!

Anyways, I wasn't in a place for a relationship at the time, and wanted to keep our relationship as a friendship and see how things go. 

Fast forward, her immediate replies started fading out, I ended up double texting her sometimes, but she was different. I legit don't recall I've treated her differently once, but she just went cold. Last text was a voice note that she didn't respond to for like 5 months when a holiday took place, I wanted to test out the waters and sent her a greeting associated with that holiday. It took her a whole day to respond with a cold response. That was the last interaction.

Till this day that story gets me thinking about the reason she did that, have I done something wrong? I just found out she unfriended me on a social media platform which I really don't get. I do respect that girl and appreciate her help, her personality type is hard to find and I'd love to have a friend or a partner that has her personality. But idk why she did that. 

I was mostly venting out in this post and thought I could use some redditors' thoughts on this.

I don't feel comfortable asking her about the reason cuz I don't wanna creep her out. Maybe I should've though.

I feel I might have been spending too much time in r/datingoverthirty lately, but I felt that the takeaway of a lots of posts is that if you are not super social, talkative, passionate and funny/witty, you don't stand a chance to find a long term relationship, especially in the jungle of OLD. There seems like everyone wants to find a unique gem, but at the same time needs to fit in some mold. 

This makes me quite puzzled as I am a serious, logical homebody who is simply looking for someone to build a long life (with hopefully a family someday) with someone that it kind, respectful and self-aware, and cannot believe there are not men who are the same way, that don't need to be constantly entertained by their partner, that are just content with companionship, intimacy and love. That is okay with boredom, quietness and simplicity and don't see the point of putting up a front on apps just to get matches as in the end, the leopard don't change its spots and pretending you are something you are not will just end up wasting everyone's time.

I sat down by myself on the couch as Jack got it for me. He gave it to me, and I had a couple of sips. Jack sat down so close that our butts were nearly touching. He put his hand around my waist. I had to use the restroom, and he offered to come to the restroom with me, but I said I was fine. I don't remember much after I stood up from the couch.

John got mad and said he couldn't hook up with me because he liked me. The next day, everyone told me what John said.

I asked John if that was true that he liked me. He denied it, and said that he had a girlfriend, and that everyone else must've bought it up a joke.

That's all I can say. Not a first date, but still weird.

He (44m) invited me (31F) to meet him at a coffee shop because we both had work we needed to do. After a few hours we stand up to leave and he mentions that he injured himself earlier in the day.

Wouldn't you know, he can't stand up and he can barely walk. Now, I'm not a petit woman. I'm 5'8""; I work out. I can help. It's not like he's *The Mountain* or anything and he's built like a little jackrabbit. So I help him up and help him to his car, but he is **struggling**.

I offer to make him dinner if he wanted to come over because I had been marinating some chicken anyway. He accepts and we head back to my house. It's worth saying that I have a three floor townhouse with lots of steps. It's also worth saying that I have a tendency to be clumsy and so I have all sorts of ace bandages, crutches, etc in my house.

I set him up on the couch, bring him water, a heating pad, a pillow to hold for sneezing/coughing, crutches to help him stand without using whatever was injured, and start cooking dinner.

Eventually he chimes in with, ""I promise I'm not just trying to show you my dick, but can you look at this?""

Wouldn't you know, there's a weird bump near his groin. So now, what was a pulled muscle might actually be a hernia. I offer to take him somewhere, but he refuses. Instead, he asks me to wrap an compression wrap around the bump.

Eventually I ask him if a warm bath would make him feel better and he says that it might. Trouble is, he can't really go from sitting to standing all too well. So I draw him a bath and sit there. The whole time. I jokingly throw in a colorful, sparkly bath bomb and bring him a glass of wine because of the sheer absurdity of the situation.

I'm sitting here. Bathing a grown man. One I met off Tinder. I felt his groin for a hernia. I compression wrapped said groin.

Well, keep reading 😂
She’s cancelled on me like 20 times till now with like 5-7 times when she actually suggests another day for us to go out! 
She forgot to give me anything on my birthday. 
At the beginning of our friendship, she’d totally ignore me whenever i compliment her( not anymore tho)
She disappears for hours and hours but then she comes back and tells me that she disappears because of a specific reason. 
She totally forgot that we’ve known each other for over a year and she seemed surprised when i told her that!
She is too busy to go out with me but sometimes she goes out with her female best friend for an hour or so.
I know she’s the oldest in her family and she’s always taking care of her old parents and younger sisters!

Which confidence is good, but its the kind of confidence that makes it seem like they could care less about having a relationship. Which again it probably a good thing, or at least much better then being desperate. Even women in their early 30s. Im not trying to generalize, just my experience. I've heard jokes about women over 30 wanting to nail a guy down quick. That doesnt seem the case, but I do live in a educated area. People are more focused on careers. Again Im not trying to stereotype, just wonder if women are actually more independent and confident then men.   


Its men who seem to be online spilling their guts about how forever alone they are, while no women over the age of 25 seems to give a flying #$$%. Or maybe Im just persevering it that way, or I have sort of built in repellent. But even women who go on 4-6 dates with me seem to very confident in themself first. Which is very attractive, but sometimes the independence makes me feel like they dont want or care that much about whatever is happening between us.  Not that Im trying to make much out of just a couple of dates, but I do care about things.  


 While I think I am a confident guy, I do want a relationship. I have my career, my friends, my hobbies and up until 27 I didnt really care that much. But something started to fill like it was missing. I want a life partner and kids. So while I dont get carried away, I do want this and sometimes people come across as a brick wall. Like they dont really care a whole lot and are very happy with building a single life. Which I am not. I dont love me career that much to be able to live and die by it. My friends are great, but they dont come home with me every night and I'm having kids with them.   


But the line is drawn between whether someone is being to needy for a relationship.   


Im trying to make sure I understand the line so I dont get desperate and settle. I try to focus on hobbies and other things so that I have purpose outside of dating. So if a date goes bad then I know I hit up the rock climbing gym and everything will be alright.  


I really do get the vibe that somehow women have been taught to be more independent and stronger then men, but that could be opening a can of worms.

I'm pretty busy at college though, with extracurriculars that aren't clubs taking up a lot of time. Please don't suggest clubs, I'm already running ragged here haha.

So the main question, how do I start? Online dating? In person? I understand a bit about how online works. Go for hinge and bumble mostly, have actually good pictures etc.

I (19M) struggle a lot with depression. I wasn't raised by the best of parents (alcoholic dad who died on the day of my high school graduation and a verbally abusive mom who can't take care of herself.) and my history with dating isn't exactly the best. I've had only two relationships so far. One was literally everything I've ever wanted in a partner. The only problem was she found out she was lesbian and so she dumped me on valentine's day through text. I even got the whole ""you're a great guy but...) speech. The one after that was a friends with benefits type thing with my best friend which turned really toxic for both of us. Both of these breakups really hurt my self esteem at the time and I started to get really bitter about love and dating.

I'm doing better now. I've been seeing a therapist who's been great, doing stuff that makes me happy  (playing music, watching good movies etc...) and my diet has gotten way better. There's still a lot of work that needs to be done but I'm definitely in a better place than I was last year. I'm starting to get comfortable with the idea of dating again but I wanted to know if anyone had any pointers about dating with depression.

Dating-wise, I feel like I've made peace with myself; I subscribe to *""I love the kind of woman that can kick my ass""* school of romance--and so does Spike Spiegel from Cowboy Bebop. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've made peace with the fact that I'm attracted to women who are physically capable, and/or good at fighting. I've made peace with the fact that I find tallness (Though that's more a preference than anything) and muscle attractive. I've made peace with the fact that to me, the ideal woman is a sporty tomboy or a warrior woman, so to speak. So I'll be looking for  a gym, or dojo--both to get fit myself, and to find the Xena to my Gabrielle.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem for me is, being and feeling dainty is still a big deal. While people don't care as much about gender norms now as they do before, a good chunk of women still like to feel delicate, ""weak"", and protected--especially if they are tall and insecure about it. A good chunk of men still think a girl who's dainty and ""easy to throw around"" is ideal, because it appeals to their instinct to be a strong protector for her. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem with me, if my type is any indication, is that I disagree with most people on this. To me, dainty, delicate, easy to throw around--just weakness in a woman is a massive turn-off. I'm not with that shit. I don't have the male instinct/desire to be a protector. And a good chunk of women (even some of the ones who are strong and fit) still want to feel or be smaller, delicate, and protected, which I can't make many women feel due to being short at 5'6/167 cm. Me being short will make dating harder for me, but ***also*** I worry about how successful I'll be due to my tastes and me not wanting to be a protector.

&amp;#x200B;

So I wanna know from the people here, what do I do? How important is feeling or actually *being* small/dainty/delicate for women?

He was my first Hinge date and after our first date we were hanging out almost every day. Unfortunately, for his job he had to move about 6 months after we met. Both of us knew he was moving and made it known it was going to be a short-term thing. 

Closer to the time that he was about to move, we had both caught pretty strong feelings. We still never discussed what the relationship would look like and he never made any initiative to make a game plan for how often we would visit each other and never asked to be official. Even though he never wanted to be official, he told his friends and family about me and claimed he had never felt like this before. He said if he wasn’t moving he would have “wifed me up” immediately. 

Before he left, i stopped seeing him for the last month because I was too sad he was leaving. I didn’t want to keep seeing him and have my feelings grow just for him to leave me when he never asked for a commitment. I explained this to him and he said he understood and we never hung out again before he left. He never gave any indication that he wanted a relationship or continue pursuing things long distance. I am assuming he did not ask to be official before moving so he could be free and single in his new city and do what he wanted (which is fair!). 

I stopped answering his texts and calls after he moved because I was trying to move on. He moved in June/July and in December he reached out and expressed he missed me and wanted to see me. I told him I had a break in school and work for a month and to book a flight and I would come. After that, i left the ball in his court and he never ended up officially inviting me out for the entire month i was free. I did not bring it up because i wanted to see if he would take initiative and do it himself. After he went a whole month without making plans, I stopped responding to him all together until March. 

He recently reached out this past week again expressing how he missed me and wants me to come visit. I expressed my frustration and he finally gave me a weekend he wanted me to come. He claims he thought i “hated him” and did not want me to reject him and did not know how i felt.  This is false because i always told him how much i liked him and how i wish he made a real attempt for us to work. He believed that if he made solid plans i would say no, which is why he made no plans… 

I know communication was not perfect on my end, but i can’t believe it took him this long to finally invite me out. He is basically begging me to come see him and make this work but still has not offered any promises of commitment. I feel like this is too little too late. My assumption is he moved and has not been doing well with dating so he is crawling back to me (i told him this and he claims he just genuinely misses me). 

I have been dating around a lot and i feel like I’ve almost completely moved on. I want to give him a chance to redeem himself because my feelings for him were real, but i don’t want to go and catch feelings again just for us to be in the exact same position. I don’t want to give him an ultimatum because i don’t even know if my feelings are still there, but i also don’t want to go out there if the relationship is a dead end. I was a crying mess when he moved and i don’t want to put myself through that again if my feelings are still there!

Sorry for the long text

Hi, I was dating a guy with BP1 for a couple of months, he is medicated and things was fantastic... whenever he is manic or depressed he would push me away from his life and I understood, will still care and check on him daily, regardless of how much he shoved me out, when he was out if it he would thank me for how much I helped him during that time, he said it really got him through

But this time he was manic and depression (mix episodes) and was shoving me out I still stuck to routine with a simple (hi, I hope you are okay, just wanted to check in)

When I texted him one time...he said he wasn't mentally ready for a relationship, and I was fine with that, but I was hurt that I had to text him first for him to tell me, I started reflecting on everything for the past month and I realized he didn't text me first ONCE in the last month...

In my mind it felt like that ""I'm not ready for a relationship"" Is his way of saying...""you can leave me alone now"" ""I don't like you""

That's how I viewed it

I know it sounds silly and I just felt unwanted and stupid.... Anyways I went NC cause it stared affecting me, and affecting my mental health He didn't text me ever since and I guess that shows he doesn't care lol

But day by day I keep thinking if he is okay, if his mental health is stable and he wouldn't do something bad to himself Someone asked me on a date and I accepted cause I am single after all but in my mind all I can think about is him and if he is okay

Things have been going really well, we’re super into each other and both enjoying where it’s going etc.

Anyway, when having a deep chat I asked why his past relationships ended. This is where he said I’d think he was an asshole since the last ‘thing’ (it was purely physical from what I heard) he had was with a married woman. He said she was in this country away from her husband and their marriage had started to break down anyway. 

We had a quick chat about it but didn’t have long together so I didn’t want to poke around about it much more. Since then I’ve been thinking about it a lot, though, but I won’t be seeing him in person again for a few weeks and it’s not exactly a conversation to have over text.

Would this worry anyone else? I can get really worried about being hurt and cannot stand the thought of anyone cheating. His morals otherwise have a really strong track record, he really sticks up for what’s right even when it’s hard to do; which is why this seems so confusing and out of character.

If you want the backstory and have 2 hours to kill, I posted about the lead up to the 1st date, the date itself, and immediately afterwards on my profile.

I had texted her earlier this morning about going to a restaurant by a seawall she said she loved, since the weather will be nice this week. She replied quickly saying it sounds great. We're gonna meet there tomorrow night. 

I'm....cautiously optimistic. On the one hand she said she's not really into dating. But yet here we are, going on a second date. I guess maybe we might have different ideas what ""dating"" means? idk

She has told me multiple times in multiple ways that she finds me attractive, as have I to her. I can make her laugh easily. Even though she calls herself a cynical walled up person she opens up to me. She gave me a ride home and we talked in her car for over an hour so I assume she trusts me or sees me as a decent person. She's asked me what my type of women are (I said like her) and what I'm looking for. I've told her about my odd work hours but I would want to make it work with her.

I assume there's some interest there? Like I don't think she'd agree to go out again just to say ""I see you as a friend"" or ""this won't work"" when a text would be so much easier. I'm just some guy from an app after all. 

Over the course of my dating experience, I've had 4 second dates, and all 4 eventually became some sort of relationship. The rest were ones and dones. So I'm a little confident. A wee bit. Itsy bitsy. TBF though those 4 made it pretty obvious they were into me, some A LOT more than others. I never went through these ""does she like me like THAT?"" thoughts with them.

One of my biggest weaknesses as far as dating goes is physical escalation. Our only physical contact on the first date were two hugs which she initiated. It's not that I have fears of being rejected or I doubt my kissing technique. It's just that I don't want to come off the wrong way or for her to think I'm some pervy creep. I don't want to scare her or be disrespectful. 

After our first date I replayed it in my mind and found like 3 different ways I could've just touched her hand or something. Tomorrow we are going to a restaurant and then after a walk along the beach/chilling on a sea wall. I want to at least hold her hand at some point. If I can get a light kiss in there, that would be great.

I'm not sure if she'd want me to. idk. Like I'm not sure how she sees me and I haven't asked.

And it always bothered me when you see stuff on TV or movies where the wife is always scolding the husband for having magazines or videos that he watches/looks at, I mean of course he has those. He masterbates. YOU masterbate. Masterbation is healthy. Why scold someone for doing something that makes them feel good and get release? As long as it’s not something he/she does everyday and leads to an addiction and he/she knows that a lot of those thing are unrealistic, then what’s the harm? And I also don’t get why people get upset when they tell their partner that they aren’t in the mood and then get upset when their partner goes to take care of themselves. I mean, they need release, and obviously if you aren’t in the mood then they won’t force you, so they need to do something to scratch that itch, right? Why is it such a big problem for so many people? Honestly, I truly don’t understand. Sexual relief is so important, for our bodies and our minds. Why get upset with someone who is doing what they need to be healthy? And if you do get upset with them, does that mean that you don’t masterbate either? Like, at all? And if you do masterbate and then get mad at your partner for doing the same… why? Why are you allowed to do it but they aren’t?

I’m a 21f and this is sad to say but I’ve already accepted the fact that I’ll be alone. I’ve had people I use to be friends with end up breaking up with their significant other and could easily get into a new relationship without a problem. I went somewhere with a group of people this weekend from school and felt so left out when everyone was discussing their dating life. Then would gush about how they meet they’re current partners and tell their cute love stories. What do they have that I don’t? I’ve never been in a relationship. I hate it when people and family tell me to focus only school yet they all found their soulmate when they were younger than me. I’ll be school for a while cause of the career path I want to pursue. I feel so unwanted and just really want to experience love. I try to talk to guys, I’m active in school, I got out and do things such as hobbies so that I don’t sit around at home. Everyone around me is just falling in love and it just hurts cause I really want that. It makes me look at my life and I see that I have no one and probably never will. I hate hugging my pillow at night wishing that it was someone that love me the way other guys do to my old friends. Guys just aren’t interested in me. There are too many people in my area that know me and would crush my confidence if they were to come across my dating profile. And the chances of someone finding it is extremely high.

I've had a few opportunities in the past with women but never really capitalized on them out of anxiety. People have always considered me attractive and I generally get positive remarks on my looks, so in terms of looks? I am fairly confident. I can also attest to this with numerous opportunities in the past where I could have hooked up with women but failed because I was nervous (yes, I have a handful of stories, it's that bad).

However, what I struggle with is dating, and for most of my life I have never really been interested in having a girlfriend up until recently.

I'm serious when I say that. For most of my life, I've focused on my friendships (a number of which are still long-lasting, 6+ years), my travels (I've been to so many places in the US and overseas) and just having fun and living a low-key, simple and stable life. Even today, I consider myself fairly stable (financially and mentally). I take care of myself, I'm clean, I dress well, I have dependable friends and family and I'm fine with that.

That said, I'm getting older and I want a girlfriend, but being inexperienced with women and never being in a relationship very much worries me when I go out into the dating world (for context, I'm in NYC, and it's very competitive here apparently). I'm not sure how women will think of me when they learn that I've never been in a relationship. I'm afraid it will be a red flag and will make it very difficult to get into a relationship.

I'm currently reading ""Models"" by Mark Manson and so far it's a great read, and it offers very realistic advice. But what I haven't noticed is that it doesn't address the problem of how women might perceive of a man if they've never been in a relationship. 

So I guess my questions are, how can I - as a 25 year old male - cope with with this fact while meeting women for dates?

It came as a huge shock to me, and he said he's been on several fringe news sites which shocked him as well. 

I've tried to be understanding of his view. We live in a crazy world right now with a lot of unknowns. But now he's admitted that because of this he's ""losing his spark"" for me and wants to take a break until more is known about the vaccines. 

I asked him for sources of evidence he's watched/read as to why he's allowing this fear to jeopardize our relationship. He says there's no evidence but there's a lot of talk in those circles. I've provided him with links to show him hard science that vaccines don't work that way and it's not a risk to him, but he won't budge. Doesn't trust mainstream media, the evidence I give him he thinks is skewed with an agenda, etc. He sites thousands of vaccine-related deaths reported on VAERS. According to VAERS website, 

""While very important in monitoring vaccine safety, While  VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness. The reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable. Most reports to VAERS are voluntary, which means they are subject to biases. This creates specific limitations on how the data can be used scientifically."" 

I hate that this fear is destroying a relationship that is or was otherwise on a great track. 

Never would I have thought that my getting vaccinated would be a turn-off in a relationship.

I don't know if this is the right subreddit for venting, if it isn't and my post gets removed, I will post this on offmychest.

I'm genuinely (almost) crying, I'm teary. There's this guy I like, I asked him out and he agreed to go out with me.

 I'm 100% mute, I can only make a few sounds, I have never bothered learning sign language, most people do not understand it anyway. Whenever I go out, I carry a pen and a notepad in my purse, or I sometimes use Whatsapp to communicate. 

He agreed to go on a date with me, after the date he tried to get sex, and I turned him down ( I'll explain the reason below )  

this morning he texted me, he said  that communicating with me is too difficult and wished me good luck.

I rejected him when he tried to get sex because the previous guys I dated slept with me 5-6 times then left.. so.. I wanted him to stick around a little longer before having sex with him. Also.. I have a hard time trusting someone, a guy turned violent on me in 2020 ( February 2020 I think ) and I got scared, I can't scream for help or call the police. Fortunately he ''only'' slapped me three times then stopped.

What angers me is that (hope I don't sound pretentious) I look pretty good, a couple of friends of mine always say I remind them of Taylor Swift and I can see where they're coming from. I don't need to compare myself to a celebrity to feel good about my appearance, just using her as an example to vaguely explain what I look like. I notice that, usually, when I go to the bar, guys/men check me out. I travelled to another town to visit my cousin last month and the guys sitting on the other side of the trip checked me out for 7 hours straight.. my dating life would be easier if I didn't have a disability.

I'm 24, for obvious reasons ( Covid ) I had a hard time meeting anyone these past two years, and I last had a proper relationship when I was in high school.

I swear I'm not seeking attention, I'm  genuinely sad and  I'd like to have someone to hug.

Okay.. maybe I sound dumb and childish in this post, but I'm just venting and sharing my frustration.

That it's the same as sex between a boss and an employee. It is wrong bc the boss has more power than the employee and that's why even if the employee consents to it, it is considered wrong.
