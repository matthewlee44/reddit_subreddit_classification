2,rs114o,1640868512,I think I need help,"Hi everyone, 
Prepping for a barrage of roasting but here goes anyway.
I‚Äôm 23 single and always have been. I really struggle with approaching girls anywhere, festivals, clubs, bars etc‚Ä¶ like I just got home had a few really cute and gorgeous girls who were dancing next to me and glancing at me and I just stood there frozen (not literally, mentally) wishing I knew what to do. Like I‚Äôll just start doubting myself, like today I thought oh she‚Äôs just playing with me, just trying to get someone who she can reject. Literally even when the opportunity is there I just start thinking negatively of the situation or about myself. 

I would say I have a fear of rejection but only when I have mates around, I guess because I think being rejected will make them think differently about me. If I‚Äôm not with mates I just go blank. I think I‚Äôm socially awkward to girls. I went to an all boys school which I like to blame for my awkwardness.

I guess I think I need to seek help with a psychologist, I genuinely think I have some underlying issues which are troubling me. Like I feel like I‚Äôm in a never ending hell because I keep going out with telling myself I‚Äôll approach someone today and never do or if I do I‚Äôll say something stupid and get rejected and back to square one I go. Rinse and repeat.

What should I do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rs114o/i_think_i_need_help/

4,rs1ehp,1640869668,"Should I block or ghost my ex? // Kind of venting here, sorry","I (27f) broke up with my ex (25m) due to deeply rooted relationship issues that persisted over 1.5 years even though we talked about them and me losing romantic feelings entirely within that timeframe.
Now, he was very surprised and to him it came out of the blue when I broke up (idek why, I mean we talked. I didn't mention losing my feelings ofc, but talking about our problems and the problems *staying* should indicate that there will be consequences after a while).
I know and get that I am the butt here (this ain't AITA, after all).
So at first he was very desperate to make me give him another chance (no, thank you), dug positive things up from the past and even fills up his empty promises that he kept empty all that time before.
3 months have passed since I broke up and he still bugs me about everything, checks in, sends huge texts and is a complete insecure mess.
We did agree to stay in light contact. So a tag in an article/post here and there is absolutely okay.
But usually, when I react to them the number increases a lot and when I notice that I stop reacting to them and every time he asks me very concerned if it was too much since he noticed i stopped reacting.
I feel like a chat bot.
We did have a time with no contact, he broke that and said that it didn't help.
I wish someone would tell him how to handle this, because it's weird having to be his ""bestie"" giving him advice about MYSELF as his EX.
I don't want that. It's weird.
And I'm dating someone else.
Oh and I'm using another, local, anonymous app and he downloaded it too, set my location to see the posts there and found one that ""sounded like me"" (and was me) and contacted me about it, because it said I'd use dating apps and he was heartbroken about it.
So yeah it's really annoying and I get that he's a being who is complicated to handle, always has been for as long as I've known him (tldr mental issues, diagnosed), but goddammit why can't I just live in peace.
I'm about to at least ghost him. But I'm frustrated that I have to STILL be the one to handle him after I broke up. He HAS friends, even female ones, so why can't he just talk to them. Or his family (he lives with his mom, and the rest of his family is close and his uncle spends lots of time with him - an uncle who I asked to please help him when I broke up. His family is great and I loved them and they are really close with each other).
I'm just annoyed, frustrated, and tired and I don't want to handle this anymore.
I know I'm an ass and I spoke negatively about him while he's just a poor heartbroken lad. But I deserve peace, too.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rs1ehp/should_i_block_or_ghost_my_ex_kind_of_venting/

How do things normally go for you guys? How often does the person you are interested in, text back? Do you have to flirt a lot to stop the conversation from getting stale or too platonic?

It's not that I'm not boring or interesting, I can hold a conversation.or more less. And I'm pretty well read and have healthy hobbies. I don't understand what the problem is?

What drew me to follow him in the first place was that I found him really inspiring and basically saw him as an example of what I would like to be and he embodies a lot of the things I strive to achieve (wisdom, knowledge, kindness, magnetic energy, health etc). 

Every now and then he goes live and speaks about things that really resonate with me, sometimes I comment but he has never noticed or responded (probably just due to the sheer amount of comments coming in fast). But today he noticed my name and my comment (the comment said something like thank you for this breath of fresh air), and he seemed to pause for a moment and said something like ‚Äúwait.. I feel like I know you? ... DM me‚Äù. I thought to myself that‚Äôs weird he feels like he knows me he must be mistaken. I watched the rest of the live and he kept mentioning my name, it made me a bit uncomfortable because I was sure he was mistaking me for someone else, so I left and started to get on with my day.

13,rs3929,1640875084,I think I'm...done (vent),"As the title says I think I'm done with dating.

Now I'm not gonna go into a sob story about it and I don't really need advice. I'm just venting about my experience and sharing my thoughts.

Tl;dr I'm quite certain it's my physical appearance.

A few months ago I (25M) installed a few dating apps to see what's up with them. I hand picked photos of me I considered were good (for reference I take a lot of photos and choose the best one, albeit I'm not photogenic) and wrote a bit about myself and my hobbies.

My profiles looked really good from my point of view, I really liked my pics and how they showcased me.

But I got about 2 matches in 2 months, both of which ghosted me even though we had the same hobbies. I consider myself an introvert, I'm not exactly good at carrying a conversation but I can talk about the things I like just fine.

Other than that I've had 0 likes.

I'm not exactly mad about it, I didn't expect much out of OLD. And I know people say ""you're young dw"" which is what they said when I was 20 so...

I'm not really worried about it, I don't think being lifetime single is gonna affect me much, except for it obviously being a bit harder with paying my taxes and making my own food when I get home and so on (ideally I'd split the work and payments with my partner so it's easier for both of us, I can't imagine letting my partner do all the work for me I wouldn't like that, I consider that as abuse)

I consider myself a 7 irl, but I'm not photogenic so I drop alot in photos, I've been told by older women (40-50+) how I'm beautiful and they always looked shocked when I told them girls don't really like me, but I suspect they're just being polite, as I'm also very polite and usually speak in what is considered a kind voice and temperament.

I'm not really disappointed by my experience, or rather lack of experience, I'm just thinking that okay, I tried the apps and they didn't work for me, so I'll just carry on like I always have. It definitely doesn't change what I like doing or my goals.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rs3929/i_think_imdone_vent/

I could tell right away he was extremely into me over a zoom call.  He told me he was 9 years sober, had been divorced for 6 years and got out of an engagement about a year ago to a woman who had bi polar disorder.

He said he likes to cuddle and kiss a lot.  He came into town to visit since his daughter lives here and when I walked into the restaurant he hugged me a long time and wanted to immediately hold my hands at the table.  He tried kissing me right away.

I don't know why but this immediately made me very shy.  I was talking just fine but I could tell I kept talking about professional things and I felt like I was being a bit pushed.

After about an hour, he said he was going to come sit next to me at he started trying to get me to put my head on his chest and kissing me and asked why I am so shy.  

He also said ""you look different, you are very pretty, but you look and act different to me"".

That made me even MORE reserved.   He walked me back to my condo and said he wanted to see me as much as possible while he was here in town and joked that he could move in with me..

We started talking again yesterday afternoon and I reconfirmed that we were still meeting up later that night. He agreed and even asked about the parking situation, to which I told him parking is incredibly limited and to Uber or he‚Äôd have to park far away. He agreed and we didn‚Äôt talk again until it was almost time to meet up. 

He sent a message about 15 minutes before the date letting me know he was running late which I only saw after I had already arrived. He doesn‚Äôt live that far away either...I texted him about 5 past asking where he was and he said he parked in a nearby garage and was taking and Uber to the restaurant. He arrived 12 minutes late and apologized then shook my hand to introduce himself which I thought was strange. It wasn‚Äôt a job interview after all. 

When we arrived at the bar he told me he was only going to get drinks and told me I could get something if I wanted to which would‚Äôve been awkward to eat and he wasn‚Äôt so I chose not to.

He ended up being a good conversationalist and didn‚Äôt run out if things to say but did spend a lot of time talking about himself asking a few things about me. I did notice he checked his watch about 3 times and pulled out his phone about that much, sometimes to show me something and also to check his texts/time I believe. He also brought up an ex girlfriend from 2 years ago who he told me had money and paid for all their dates. He said they went out for about 6 months.

My roommate came back from a 3rd date with this guy, and I asked how it went. She said ""I don't feel a romantic connection with him."" Then I said 'oh, what don't you like about him?' Then she double downs saying she just doesn't feel it is all.

Me personally, I know the EXACT reason why I don't like a girl/guy. I can pinpoint it. It's usually:

1) No physical/sexual attraction. I just don't like their face. The thought of them on top of me thinks 'nooooo.'

2) Very out of shape

3) Obnoxious. Hanging out with him/her for 30 minutes gives me a headache.

4) Personalities and humor don't mesh. I tell a funny story and they shoulder shrug, then they tell me about their hiking trip and I shoulder shrug.

5) They're behind in life / going through circumstances I don't want to connect with.

I can always pinpoint it, yet for some of my friends, they always claim it's just general abstract 'no spark' feelings which just sounds weird to me.

Everyone says college is supposed to be where you meet the most people and have the most experiences and such but here I am only a few months away from graduating and I'm still a virgin, have yet to even kiss a girl smh.

I'm not sure if its just this age demographic or this generation or what but it absolutely sucks in the dating scene. People are fake and superficial as hell and OLD n hookup culture only makes things worse. Girls seem to only chase the obnoxious loud frat guys with little substance beyond their facade of good looks and money and such who are just trying to up their bodycount, then complain when they get burned by those same guys and won't even look in the direction of normal fellas. 

I'm not a rich supermodel trust fund kid by any means, but I'm not quasimodo either, and I like to think I'm a relatively interesting, well rounded individual. I was never into flashy hypebeast fashion like supreme or whatever, but I always put effort into my fits and dress pretty well, I'm not a gym rat but I do exercise every day to keep my body healthy, I have hobbies that I love that I'm really good at like painting, knitting, playing piano and working on cars, I'm passionate about my career and will be attending a top law school in the fall, but I've always been polite and humble and kind to everyone, never arrogant or brash like alot of the guys I see.

I got some flak for some of my female friends for being too ""conservative"" in my mindset and approach, but I had no idea that wanting a stable relationship where there is mutual respect and equal investment from both parties is ""conservative""  these days; I always considered myself pretty open-minded and never discriminated by religion, race, sexuality, height, weight, etc. all I looked for was someone that likes me for who I am.

49,rs7gfz,1640886213,"I have a physical limitation, is it making me undatable?","Throwaway because embarrassing. This has been eating at me for years and I need to get it off my chest. I have pretty serious nerve damage in one of my legs and it really limits what I'm able to do physically. My balance is poor and I'm more prone to injury than the average person, so I avoid a lot of physical activities. I'm on hinge and while my profile gets a decent amount of engagement, it seems like every guy who matches with me lists must-haves that are always pretty specific physical activities. Most frequently I see guys saying they \*need\* someone who is into hiking and/or rock climbing and/or running. I'm naturally slim and I watch what I eat, so what I think is happening is that guys look at me and assume I have some degree of athleticism. But I don't. At all. I do some very light yoga just so I'm not completely sedentary, but I'm so ungraceful I just want to do it alone so I can go slow and not die of embarrassment if I lose my balance and topple over. It's very far from something I would want to do with someone who's just getting to know me. When I get matches physical activities come up within the first few messages. I am so tired of explaining what I can't do and it being a deal breaker.

I'm 34 and while I'm trying to resist it, I'm beginning to really worry that this limitation will keep me from finding a partner. Dating culture has become so fast and the overall feeling is that if you don't have 100% in common with a person you can just hop on an app and find someone else. I'm frustrated because it's not like I have nothing else going for me. I'm well educated, my interests are varied, I have a good job, close relationships with friends and family, I can carry conversation well, and I have hobbies that I'm passionate about. I get asked out for second dates probably 90% of the time after a first date, but I keep bumping up against this issue of not having a physical hobby in common with these guys and things fizzle as soon as I decline a hike - which seems to ALWAYS be the suggestion for a second or third date. My second/third date suggestions don't seem to get much traction because they're not blatant exercise.

I went on a date with a guy this week who I really like, but at least twice during the date he brought up hiking and it just gave me the same sinking feeling that I can't meet a pretty basic expectation.

58,rs8f1z,1640888646,Letting go of the anger; Lessons Learned,"
Lessons I have learned from my last relationship, after months of grief, growth, and realization.  Maybe they will prove helpful to some of you guys as you move forward:

There is nothing that I could have done in my past relationship that would have made things turn out any different.  I have realized the anger that I am holding on to is only the product of accepting that others‚Äô hate and negativity towards me as truth.

I am not perfect, but relationships are not strong based on perfection.  They are made stronger with effort, forgiveness, mutual respect, understanding, and the love that sees through the small things and motivates both partners to work toward better.

I will continue to work on improving myself, but I will not do that for my ex or any future partner.  I will improve for myself, and love myself and the flaws that I am addressing.  

I will recognize toxic behavior in others, and distance myself from them.  I will value my own well-being and not sacrifice it to satisfy anyone.  I will not blame myself for others‚Äô inability to see my value.

I will reject the assertion that toxic behavior by others is a reflection upon myself.  I will not allow my heart to become bitter in response to others‚Äô negativity.  

I will accept that my kind heart and spirit to serve others is not a weakness, but a source of incredible strength.  

I will allow myself to struggle in difficult times, and forgive myself for mistakes made when I am overwhelmed.  However, I will take full responsibility for these mistakes and work to make them right.

I will never place anyone else on the pedestal that I should always reserved for myself.  However, I will give my love, kindness, and best effort to a partner who reciprocates equally.

I will never beg for anyone to recognize my value. I will work to better see the value and goodness in those around me.

I will never fall in love again.  Instead, I will rise in love, and lift up my partner who does the same for me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rs8f1z/letting_go_of_the_anger_lessons_learned/

I took up some courage and asked for a date, and I never seen a person respond so happily, I was stoked, I never had a person be so excited to hang out with me. I bought tickets for theater, since she really enjoys it, and a book of poetry to give her to not show up empty-handed. The days passed and everything was going fine, until the day before the date. 
We had a strange conversation that day about our sexual experiences and what to expect in future relationship, I was not comfortable with the whole situation, but I kept it for me and just responded as honestly as ever, saying I don't have much experience and not knowing enough about relationships to make points. I have been extremely respectful in all of this, keeping myself some controversial opinions (she was asked me if I'd ever be ok with an open relationship and I told her I don't know, but in truth I am not for it at all), well the afternoon passes. We talked bout about the teather arranging where and what to do, then we both went to our homes.
In the evening I receive some messages saying stuff about how much she likes me as a person but she sees me as a friend, to which I responded that it was ok anyway, but I hoped there would have been something more. 
The hang out went fine, but in the following days I kept myself at distance because I didn't want to develop a serious crush, I stopped writing to her and I just want to understand what happened, it's been 10 days since I do not hear her, and I don't know what wrongs I did to have such a 180¬∞ attitude toward me

63,rs8xe1,1640889951,"Am I the only one who thinks that the saying ""If he wanted to, he would"" can be toxic?","Don't get me wrong, I 100% believe there is truth to that statement and applies to many situations, but I do believe there are times when it really doesn't. I notice this saying being said a lot as it trended through TikTok so its become a saying. As I mentioned earlier, I do believe there are many cases where saying this is warranted, but I believe that there are cases where this isn't true. In this post, I am going to be speaking in the context of making the first move and dating, not in official relationships that have been established. 

I'm a woman, I work in a male dominated industry, I have male friends, so I've seen and heard their struggles in love which is why I believe this saying doesn't apply to all situations. I've seen guys become very hurt from past relationships, and because of that they are afraid to make the first move on a girl. Given that men are expected to make the first move, I can imagine it puts a lot of stress on men  who are afraid to make the first move from past hurt. 

I do also think that the saying reinforces the idea that we all must adhere to gender expectations in dating, or else something is ""wrong"". It gives off the idea that men have to be the ones to always pursue, and never women. I imagine for a guy who is constantly pursuing a woman without the woman doing anything in return might make him feel as if she isn't interested. It takes two to tango, there should be an effort on both sides. I know women who made the first move, and are in loving relationships today. 

There are situations where a man doesn't have it in him to be someone's significant other that don't have to do with a lack of interest, whether that be due to struggles with mental health, pressure from their career, school, etc.. Society tends to forget that men struggle too. Its not always a case of the man simply not wanting the woman, but not being in a place where he can pursue something. In my opinion, if a guy knew he couldn't give me what I need, I wouldn't want to be with that person and I would actually appreciate the honesty as he was self aware enough to know that continuing on with me would've been worse in the long run. If someone wants to prioritize school and career over a relationship, that's well within their rights. However, that doesn't mean someone can't still have interest in you. 

Giving this advice to a woman who is going through a breakup for the reasons I mentioned above isn't helpful at all. If anything, it can make her feel as if she isn't good enough because someone couldn't fulfill her needs. It doesn't fully explain the situation. 

I do also firmly believe that there are cases of the man just not being interested in the woman, and therefore this saying would apply. Am I the only one who feels this way?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rs8xe1/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_that_the_saying_if/

66,rs9cat,1640890985,I Fucked 6 Women This Week,"29M And yes despite the clickbaitiness of the title this has actually happened a few times this year now. But I say that not to brag but to note that I was also ghosted 5 times since the end of last month. I'd be lying if I said I figured out how to get any woman I want to sleep with me.

I'm not rich, famous, or hot, somewhat tall is the only thing I have going for me, but the key to success for me is not being jaded by past failures. Everytime you approach a woman or go on a date expecting it to go wrong because of something that happened before you've already failed. As a man if you have ambitions to be with the type of women every man is after, you should expect to be rejected A LOT, because they're getting offers every day constantly and you just may be less her type than someone that already approached her. But that's not to say give up because you're not rich or tall, but just try and approach a different woman. 

I realize I probably date too much and it doesn't really make sense to do things like me, but I'm of the belief that if you didn't get rejected/ghosted 100 times this year you really didn't try that hard. I think a lot of men are hurt by rejection more because our egos tell us that it's only happening to us, and successful men don't go through rejection. I'm here to say it's everyone and successful men get rejected the most, they just also care the least. So move on from whatever girl you think broke your heart I guarantee you can do better.

67,rs9fy8,1640891233,What did I miss?,"I am really struggling with this one.  I am one year out of a marriage (technically separated still, settlement needs to be finalized ‚Ä¶ we own a business.  But all feelings are done).  

I had put myself out there previously with someone that I met on Tinder, its was a pen pal type thing, and we met up every once in awhile but this lasted 6 months.  It fizzled, it hurt, but I realized that I was still falling into old behaviors and putting in more effort and expecting more.  Lesson learned, plus i wasnt ready.
 
Since the embarrassment of my x and the marriage, i have stayed away from social media.  I have it, but I‚Äôm not active.  I have downloaded Snapchat, because I know who is in the tiny circle and who sees my snap stories.  I keep that circle relatively small.  When i first downloaded it in August, a boy I knew from childhood added me.  (He had actually tracked me down 4 years ago and was delighted I actually communicated with him.  I kept my distance as I was married and having a baby. ) Any who,  he would watch all my stories and occasionally message something nice or compliment my parenting or say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a mans dream‚Äù, etc.  He snapped me two week ago and asked if was ‚Äúmomming of the year or breaking necks tonight‚Äù‚Ä¶ these are not convos I started.  He suggested a few times that we meet up, coffee, drinks, dinner,  all of it.  All of my snaps are exactly who i am in real life.  I dont put on a facade, you get a glimpse into my life.  So its not like I‚Äôm presenting something different.  Its just me and my son and me occasionally going out with the girls or playing softball, or projects around the house.
 
I have always had a crush on him, but I haven‚Äôt seen him in 20 years.  So i was really nervous to meet up and him not be who i remembered.  I didn‚Äôt want to meet up because i didn‚Äôt want to get my feelings hurt if I did still crush on him.   QUESTION 1: Would you think he liked me so far?

I finally agree to meet up on a whim.  I showed up in sweatpants and a tank, no makeup‚Ä¶ to give the idea that it was just friends and no expecations.  I walked in and all those feelings rush back.  We talked for hours, had some drinks, he even snapped me when he went to the bathroom ‚Äúyou are exceeding all expectations, its a joy laughing with you‚Äù. I stated i was looking to date.  And he joked ‚Äúive been trying to get you out for months‚Äù. I invited  him back to my house (not my style), but i hoped for more convo and a kiss.  WE KISSED and emotions got to the best of us and we hooked up.  Multiple times.  It was incredible.  

We txted after, i restated waht I wanted‚Ä¶dating and he said he was down for that.  I kept my distance at first, and then asked ‚Äúare we back to not chasing each other?‚Äù And he replied I‚Äôve reached out more than you have.  So i upped the game.  I‚Äôd send little txts so he knew i was thinking of him.  He received them well.  I would need  some reassurance that this is what he wanted.  He told me that I was intimidating and he was so nervous to meet me.  QUESTION 2: He likes me still? 

AND then he would start initiating sexual convos only.  So i really got confused.  But I did wan to see him again and I said as much.  With Christmas close, i knew that we would have to wait a little bit. Fast forward a week, he asked if i worked out because he was tuned on thinking of exploring my sweaty body. I steer the convo away from sexual talk.  I asked ‚Äúwhy are you still single?‚Äù Innocent but probing. He responds, ‚Äúim
 a 38 yer old man child. with resentment towards unresolved. past issues‚Äù. those issues are ‚Äúcommitment issues, unable to give myself attention i  need, and ive  settled in the past‚Äù.  I asked i he was working on those issues and he immediately said ‚Äúi know why you were married‚Äù.   Frustrated I said  ‚úåüèª.  He wrote  back ‚Äúmiss you. Merry Christmas.  Catchya on the flip.  Fun while it lasts üíã ‚Äú. 

I let it go, but kind of pissed.  I txted him the next morning and said ‚Äúwe had fun.  We enjoyed each other‚Äôs company.  I expressed what i wanted, admittedly loosely.  I thought we were on the same page.  And just like that catch ya on the flip and fun while it last‚Ä¶.as if you didn‚Äôt spend months stoking me, trying to get me to meet up.‚Äù

He responded. ‚ÄúYou seem to be after time and attention that I can‚Äôt Currently give, while going back and forth on things.  All the while, you have a lot going on in your life.  i am not a hard out, but‚Äù.

i unfriended him on snap and didn‚Äôt block him on the phone.  But im seriously at a loss.  My feelings are hurt because yet again im just discarded and i have no idea why.  How do you keep at someone for months  for a date and say ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt give time and attention‚Äô.  i have a child, im not full of free time.

I half expect him to txt me sorry.  I‚Äôm that confused.

73,rs9txu,1640892227,Why do ghosts come back if they are only going to ghost again?,"I want to apologize for the length of this post ahead of time. It's a bit of a saga (and perhaps not the most interesting to read), but I find writing to be a cathartic experience, so I feel like I need to get this out of my system.

I (25M) first started talking with James (35M) about a year ago on Grindr. I found him to be extremely attractive, and after we had chatted for a bit, he ticked a lot of my boxes. It seemed like we had some chemistry. As opposed to most people on Grindr, James made it pretty clear in his profile that he was more interested in dates than hookups, which was totally fine with me. He felt like a catch and way out of my league, so I didn't really have high hopes that anything would happen.

After chatting for a bit, I asked if we could exchange social media info, and we started talking on Snapchat: nothing too crazy, but definitely flirty messages from time to time. But about a week or two after we started talking, it was around 10pm on a Friday night. I was hanging out in my apartment, and he sent a message asking if I wanted to come over. Of course, I was excited and readily agreed. So I drove over, and we had a great time talking and then cuddling on his couch while watching Bakeoff. Later, we hooked up, and I ended up going home around 2am. The whole experience was by no means jaw-dropping amazing, but it seemed like we'd both had a good time and that we might see each other again. Over the course of the next several weeks, we continued chatting on Snapchat here and there, and this is where the true evasive behavior began. I asked several times if he was free to hang out in a purely non-sexual way (going on a walk with his dogs, going for a hike, that sort of thing), and he would come up with some sort of excuse as to why he couldn't. At first, the excuses seemed legitimate: it was mid-December and he had to study for exams for some classes he was taking; he needed to quarantine before going to see his family for the holidays.

This continued for about a month, and then our conversation petered out. I was a bit bummed, but that's the way many of these things go, so I didn't think much of it. Considering we'd met on an app and had no real commitment to each other, I didn't consider this to be ""ghosting."" But a few weeks afterward, he started messaging me on Snapchat again, explaining that work had been really busy and apologizing for falling off the map. At that point, I'd pretty much accepted the fact that nothing was going to happen between James and me, and so when he popped back up, I was confused but mostly ecstatic. Again, I asked if we could hangout, and this time, his excuses were more questionable: he was still really busy at work; he was renovating his bathroom and really wanted to focus on finishing that project. Anyways, at a certain point, I asked him point-blank if he was interested in seeing me again, and his response (which in retrospect, should've been a big red flag) was along the lines of ""I'm not not interested."" But by then, I was infatuated. He seemed really sweet and put together (and hot), and I couldn't help but develop a bit of a crush.

I recently finished reading a book on attachment theory (definitely look up an article if you don't know about it. I found it a helpful frame of reference through which to analyze my romantic experiences), and it's pretty clear to me that I have a more anxious attachment style: I'm someone who overthinks situations (especially in a romantic context) and so need more regular validation to feel confident in a relationship. James really triggered that anxious behavior: I did my best not to overwhelm him or come across as needy. I tried to limit myself to sending a message every few days, which he would often leave unopened/unresponded to for a day or two. Even worse, he had once accidentally shared his location on Snapchat, so I could see whenever he logged in. I found myself constantly checking my phone. Why hadn't he responded yet? It had been 12 hours, and he'd been online a bunch of times! Of course, I tried to rationalize it: he was a busy guy. He was a bad texter. He'd get back to me eventually, which he inevitably did, although not until I'd spent entire afternoons preoccupied. But I had no sense of how he was feeling about the whole situation: if he was genuinely interested in me or if this was just a way to pass the time. So after another month, I thought it was best to bite the bullet and just ask. I drafted a message that basically said: ""Hey, I'm really into you. I can't tell how you're feeling, and it's bumming me out. Are you interested in hanging out again?"" I'm generally not the most direct person (it's something I've been actively working on), so I was proud to have been vulnerable and honest with my feelings. He saved the message and responded quickly with: ""Hey, I'm in a meeting right now, and I want to take the time to more thoughtfully respond to this later,"" which I thought was a mature way to handle it. But after a few days, it became clear that he had either forgotten about the message or had actively chosen not to respond. I was sad, obviously. But I took it as a sign that anyone who wasn't able to at least give me a response (whether it be positive or negative), wasn't emotionally available, and I tried to convince myself that I was better off. This was ghosting number 1.

Months passed. At some point, his profile popped back up on Grindr, but I kept my distance. If he felt the need to reach out, he knew where to find me. But about six months after the initial ghosting, I caved and sent him a quick hello on Grindr and asked how he was doing. He responded, and we had a short but cordial conversation, and again, things petered off. But I may have opened the door just a crack because, over the course of the next two months, he sent a few sporadic messages: ""Hey, I was going to suggest we start chatting on Snapchat again"" ""I owe you a response to that message you sent. I will do that, I promise."" These messages were sent every few weeks, often late at night (past midnight). I would respond hesitantly, trying to establish some boundaries and expectations to gauge if he did in fact want to reinitiate.

This all came to a head around Thanksgiving time (8 months after the initial ghosting), when he finally sent several Snapchat messages fully apologizing and explaining that he'd gotten a lot of anxiety around texting during the pandemic, and that's why he had avoided responding. While it didn't excuse the behavior, I at least appreciated the explanation. And so we tried to set some boundaries before we started talking again: I said that I needed him to be more responsive. He somewhat agreed, but qualified his agreement with the fact that he didn't enjoy smalltalk, which I could understand (although, again, another red flag). I then told him that if we started talking again, it was with the expectation that we would actually meet up. No more evasiveness. To this, he also agreed. I was still a little reluctant (and several of my friends expressed their own skepticism), but I couldn't help that I was still really into him and wanted to believe that he had actually changed. We started chatting, again with some flirty messages, and after a few days, we decided to hang out in the evening of that coming Sunday. But as the weekend rolled around, I sent a few messages trying to confirm the time, and he came up with an excuse as to why the evening was no longer good for him. It was starting to feel like deja vu, but he immediately suggested an alternative time, so I let it slide. We ended up going for an hour and a half walk after work a few days later. He bought me a cup of tea from a cute little tea shop, and the conversation flowed smoothly. Again, it wasn't an outstanding date, but I had a really good time and wanted to see where things went. At the end of the date, I asked for his number (Snapchat just wasn't doing it for me), and we agreed to hang out again.

The next two weeks, we were both busy. He was flying home to see his parents. I was swamped at work. We chatted occasionally, but I didn't feel compelled to try to make plans until I got some time off. But after things had calmed down for both of us, I once again initiated, asking if he was free to hang out over the weekend. There was another excuse as to why he was busy, but that we should check-in at the beginning of the coming week. The feelings of deja vu were beginning to creep back in. It was feeling hard to pin him down, but he at least was putting some effort in, it seemed. We eventually agreed to meet for lunch at a local Mexican restaurant. We both had burritos and chatted for an hour. The conversation felt easy. We laughed, joked, and told stories, and at the end, I once again found myself infatuated with him. We both had the following week off from work (the week after Christmas), and as we parted ways, he suggested that it might be fun to meet up to watch some more Bakeoff together. I said that sounded like a lot of fun and left the date feeling cautiously optimistic.

We didn't message for a few days, but I was feeling less anxious. I wished him a merry Christmas, and he responded in turn. The next day (Sunday), I asked if he was still free to meet up. He didn't respond to the text, and I felt my anxiety coming back. But I tried to quell it: it was right after the holidays, so he was probably just busy. A day passed, and I decided to send a follow-up text. Again, no response. The warning signs were all there that he was ghosting me, but I didn't want to believe that he would do that again. I waited another day (Tuesday) before I gave him a phone call, and left him a voicemail explaining that I wanted to see him again, and was feeling a bit anxious about not hearing anything. I also made it clear that there would be no hard feelings if he decided that he was no longer interested, but just to let me know. About half an hour later, I noticed I had a missed call from James, but I'm pretty sure he had accidentally called me back after listening to the voicemail and then immediately hung up the phone, as I never heard my phone ring. I tried calling him back, to which he didn't pick up. Through all this, I could still see his location on Snapchat and knew that he was actively on his phone. At this point, as much as I didn't want to admit it to myself, I began to accept the fact that he was ghosting me again. Last night, I deleted Snapchat from my phone, and this morning, I called him one final time, left a voicemail explaining how hurt and confused I was feeling and wished him the best in working through his shit.

Clearly, James has a textbook avoidant attachment style. As much as I tried to tone down my enthusiasm, I definitely came on pretty strong, and I think the thought of intimacy probably scared him. Although I know rationally that I didn't do anything to cause him to respond in this way, it's taking some time for the emotional side of my brain to catch up. As much as his behavior is inexcusable, I'm still really into him. What I really don't understand is why he would reach out again in the first place? He knew how I felt about him the last time we talked, and while I hope he wasn't being malicious, knowing our past history, why would he reinitiate if he wasn't feeling emotionally ready or available? I guess it's futile to try rationalize that sort of behavior, and as a result, I feel pretty shitty that I got wrapped back up in this whole thing. Definitely not the best way to spend a week off.

I told her I was cutting her off in a nondirect way, but then she started to hit me up so I asked her a on third date that she wanted to do. It was ok.., but still the same. Like she didn't even hug me after this date when she left. 

I told her. That I can't really read her after the date, and I don't know if she is interested in me or is looking for friends. She didn't text back...

So I asked the next day if I could call her. I felt it would be rude to call her outta the blue so I asked . She said she was with a coworker at the moment and would call me back later if it didnt get super late. She never did..... 

I am confused. This girl is my type, however, is a horrible communicator or shit maybe I am as well. However, she sends me so many mixed signals that I don't know if I should just go my own way.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rsa2vn/should_i_just_cut_my_losses_with_this_girl/

He was watching my stories and liking my posts the whole time but never texted.

85,rsb30r,1640895479,Why does it seem like nobody values good relationships in the young dating community anymore?,"Just a question I pose from reading experiences on the internet and personal experiences from people I talk to. It seems that everybody's trust issues are so fucked up to the point where we don't care if we constantly hurt somebody else. Young men Ik constantly talk ab having multiple women while simultaneously being in a relationship but when a girl does the same it's a problem. Girls talk ab having good relationships but constantly give the genuinely good men who aren't weirdos no chance, while complaining about getting cheated on. I hear the same stories from multiple people of both genders complaining about how men/women ain't shit. I think it's time we stop glorifying looks and toxic behavior and get back to building solid relationships that aren't just built on sex and a vision of what you think that person can be. The toxicity is ruining good peoples trust and keeps this vicious cycle of who can hurt who the most. Ik this isn't a take that can be said for everybody bc GOOD PEOPLE DO STILL EXIST.

87,rsb8g2,1640895862,22M. Zero Dating Experience and Seriously Beginning to Worry.,"I‚Äôll get straight to it.

I have had absolutely zero romantic/sexual experience. When I say that, I‚Äôm talking zero girlfriends and still a virgin, let alone still never having dated or kissed a girl. 

Firstly, I recently turned 22 and I‚Äôve generally been feeling quite content about how things have been going, been working hard, have a great college course and friends that I‚Äôm grateful for. Although, while I don‚Äôt like to dwell and come across as despondent, I sometimes can‚Äôt help but let the fact that I‚Äôve essentially had a perpetual non-existent love life make me feel concerned and even embarrassed and ashamed at times.

I‚Äôm not one to post personal rants online like this, and in retrospect, I‚Äôm aware that it‚Äôs a relatively foolish thing to complain about, but I‚Äôm really getting tired of suppressing my discontent towards this. Most of my friends are aware that I‚Äôve never been in any serious relationship, but I doubt they know about having zero sexual encounters in general. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm good-looking but I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôm not inherently ‚Äòugly‚Äô either. The fact that I‚Äôm an introvert too doesn‚Äôt help at all. I have a few friends who are girls but I‚Äôve never really come close to breaking that barrier beyond friendship. 
I feel like I only have myself to blame as I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve devoted too much time and effort into things like studies in contrast to actively trying to pursuit a romantic relationship of some kind, I‚Äôve never really prioritised it. Although, the fact that I‚Äôve reached 22 has only made things more difficult, out of fear of what girls will think should I ever find someone.

I try to maintain an optimistic mindset and refrain from droning on about this to people close to me, I know that there‚Äôs an unhealthy social stigma around losing ones virginity but this is really starting to have an effect on my confidence and self esteem. When it does get addressed on the rare occasion, Ive been hearing the same shit for years like, ‚Äòit‚Äôs not a race‚Äô, ‚Äòyou‚Äôre a great guy, you‚Äôll find someone when the times right‚Äô etc, but nothing has changed. I put effort into my appearance, would like to think I can get on well casually with other girls, but initiating anything beyond friendship has just been extremely difficult for me. When sexual experiences are addressed with friends, I can‚Äôt help but feel flustered and bitter. I really don‚Äôt want that to exacerbate.
The premise of mainstream dating apps sound kinda dumb, as well as the current dating scene. Maybe I‚Äôm just being too cynical, I dunno anymore. Plus the pandemic doesn‚Äôt help.

I mostly just wanted to let this out but If you‚Äôve any constructive advice or anything, it would mean a lot. If you‚Äôve actually read this far, I really do appreciate it, and I know there are many far worse things to worry about. Stay safe everyone, cheers.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rsb8g2/22m_zero_dating_experience_and_seriously/
88,rsb95z,1640895913,I've been on 5 dates with this girl; I am overthinking things?,"Title. I've been on 5 great dates with a girl I met on Bumble. We have had sex at the end of the last 3 dates. I am really into her.

About a week ago she told me how she really likes me and would like to see how things go and how she even told her mother about me. She is busy with her work and always tells me that ""she makes time for someone important like me.""

Recently I can't tell if she is starting to pull away or if I'm just overthinking. Previously she use to text me a fair bit during the day including selfies, however, now it isn't as often. I feel like I have to carry a lot of the conversations when we text but she still used pet names (i.e., handsome &amp; babe) when talking to me and is always down to meet up. Nothing felt off yesterday on our date; we were cuddling after sex I told her that I like spending time with her and she proceeded to kiss me/my neck. I am tentatively suppose to see her on Saturday. I was also tentatively going to have the ""What are we?"" conversation after the next 2ish dates or so.

1. Am I overthinking this? I think the fact that she still wants to see me and be sexually active with me is a great sign. She has only ever ""cancelled"" one date (our last one) but offered another day right away (i.e.,""I'm sorry anon something came up, can we do Wednesday instead?"").
2. Should I ask her if everything is okay? I feel like that might come off as too strong and scare her away.
