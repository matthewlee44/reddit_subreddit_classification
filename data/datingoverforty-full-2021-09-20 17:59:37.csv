It seems like every time we start to get close and I think the relationship is going somewhere he seems to pull back. He will not see me for the weekend or longer. Becomes distant with texting and calling. He went to a funeral on Friday, so when he sent a text Friday night that he just wanted to be alone I understood. However, I never heard from him again until after 5 pm Sunday night.  By then I was a bit upset, as this is textbook for him. The weeks prior were great. We spent several weekends together. We even shared the ""I love you"" a few times those weekends. We've been dating/courting since April. I mentioned mid week last week that I was probably time for him to meet my 14 yr old son. I explained that my son deserves to put a face with a name, especially if I'm going to continue to stay over at his house. Of course, I said ""only if this is something you are ready for"". He agreed he should meet my son. Maybe it was too much,  I don't  know? I mean, it's been like 6 months since we started dating? 
When he pulled back this weekend and contacted me Sunday evening I ignored the text for several hours, because I just didn't know how to respond. Also, the text was an article link about Dodger baseball game occurrence, no message (Which i felt was sent to see how or if I would respond). When I didn't after two hours he called, and I did not answer. 
I text about an hour later that I wasn't in the mood to talk. That I was bummed on how the weekend played out and tired of feeling as if I was at peoples disposal. Said ""maybe I'll be up for a phone conversation tomorrow"". 
Am I the one overreacting or am I in a one sided relationship? Being this confused is not a good sign for this relationship, but I do love our time when we are together. He mentioned early on that he doesn't get close to people. Was that said to be used as an out when convenient or warning that he takes a really long time to build trust with?

Great conversation and everything felt so effortless so we planned a first date.  Originally I usually only do drinks for a first meet but the more I talked to her the more comfortable I felt planning something more traditional.  We both love comedy so we did dinner, comedy show after,  and ended up bar hoping after that.  

My first date turned into a 7 hour marathon and it was the most comfortable and relaxing first date I've ever had.  She asked me to go hiking the next day since we both had a kid free weekend and the marathon continued.  So many common interests and just a general sense of ease between the two of us.  Also helps that she's drop dead gorgeous 😁

We both have our kids next weekend but are planning to meet for a quick lunch and already have more elaborate plans for our next kid free weekend.

Our divorce isn't even finalized, but we have been separated for a year now.  I hadn't really considered dating yet, but I guess this new information about my ex has just got me curious about my own potential for 'getting back out there' when I'm ready.


I just don't know when I'd have the time.  My kids are 7, 6, and 18 mos.  I work from home but my job is hectic and the hours can be erratic.  Just keeping up with school and daycare schedules alone is exhausting.  My parents stay with me most of the week to help me out (I am sooo lucky to have them) but even so, I have hardly any time to myself.  This is ok with me- I am grateful that I have legal and physical custody (my ex only gets one day a week visit, no sleepovers) and I prefer to have my kids over any other relationship, but I guess I do wonder if I'll ever have a chance to meet and connect with someone and develop a relationship.


Of course there's the desire for physical/romantic connection. It makes me feel pervy/creepy to say out loud to strangers on the internet, but I would like to touch and to feel a woman in a trusting and intimate way again.  I can't help but think, though, what do I have to offer for a woman? A life of 'instant mom'?  Homework and diapers and 'ok, after we clean up dinner and get the kids to bed I have to work for a few more hours, don't wait up'. 


Please give me the hard truths.  Should I take the idea of dating off the table at least until my kids are older?  It's been so long since I've dated, and I wasn't even very good at it when I was younger and better looking...  

Or is it possible to find the time to date and still give your children all the time and attention they need?  If so, where do people meet? Do a lot of people wind up meeting other single parents by way of being involved with school or other kids activities?  Do people or age use the dating apps?

Recently been reflecting on availability and expectations in dating.  I am the proud owner of a new puppy and my desire to date has completely bottomed out.  She is going to require a lot of time as she is a working spaniel and I am intending on having her trained for sporting. So it's gonna be at least 1-2 years of intense training and then a lifetime of long walks.  (Who needs the gym!)   Anyway... since she has come into my life a man I have been speaking to daily has also had a change of circumstances and is back to work and our schedules don't seem to align (he is in another timezone as well).  I think up till this time I would have expected daily contact (attachment style and make that pretty blunt up frupfrontont.)  Now I see how I am not really doing this myself as life has just gotten BUSY.  

So to my questions:

1. Do you expect daily contact from your matches in the early stages? If this dies out have you been able to keep anything going or just let it go as to when life is less full.
2. Do you feel it's better not to date when big life changes come up?  (think job change, move, new pet etc

Anyway... random Tuesday pondering but hey!

Bare with me I realise this sounds incredibly judgemental. BUT .....


The first man contacted me to say he was over half hour late due to traffic and then when he did arrive, he asked me to leave the cafe to assist with the parking ticket machine. It was in public place well known to me so I did. Read the instructions by the machine out to him, i.e. put money in machine, press button and display ticket. He said he to had to go back to cafe to get change. So I advised him to go short distance to sign posted free parking bays. And returned to cafe whilst he moved his car.

The second we went for walk and he suggested we get ice cream, whilst we were reading the menu he asked me what the different flavours/mixes/cones were. I answered that I had no idea other than what was written that I have no additional information available to me. At this he was seemingly stumped at what choice he would/ should make. Although we had a bit of a conversation about possibilities and my choices, he was flustered at making an order, so I ordered and waited ahead of him.

In both I observed multiple similar behaviours and I guess the thing I'm wondering is how can grown men in to their forties be unable to demonstrate simple independent living and social skills but confidently assert they feel ready to be fathers. I don't doubt that men have experienced similar however that's just not my POV. Do others find adults faltering in simple tasks a source of despair?

I (48M) was married for 21 years before it sadly finally ended.

I recently started dating again and met a wonderful lady who is 47. We live in Los Angeles. She was never married before. Most of her relationships lasted only 3 months. One lasted five years. She is adorable and so kind and loving and I just cannot wrap my head around the fact that she was never married before.

My question relates to the following:

We have been in a relationship for 2 months. She says she is serious and that I am her boyfriend. 

I really love her and she tells me she loves me. 

We are basically a couple.

But during these 2 months she has been gone twice; once on a one week camping trip with friends which is perfectly fine because it was already booked before. But now she left again. This time to take yoga classes in New York City. She is somehow addicted to experiences. Constantly.

I was fine with her going to New York since yoga is her passion. But I did feel it was awkward to leave your boyfriend when you are in a brand new relationship. Maybe I am old fashioned but I like to be with my new partner as much as possible. When I talked to her about it she didn't get it.

She also says she has a key to an apartment of a man in New York who is supposedly married but who never lives there in which she is allowed to stay any time she wants. She has stayed in this apartment once a month for the last year(s). Serious red flag I thought since giving keys to someone means you are usually involved with that person sexually. But again. Maybe that's just me. So I send her an email about my concerns and that I felt bad. She only replied ""thank you for sharing your feelings"". No denial. Nothing.

Now she is texting me (still from New York) that she is not only going to Yoga but also going out in the evenings with friends. 

She loves music so she is going (by her self she says) to bars and clubs with life performances where she is meeting some of the bands that are playing. Then she sends me texts that she is so happy that some of these guys give her compliments about how young she looks for her age. Now I am completely lost. I ask her what she is doing and that this is flirting and she says she knows these people for years and that she has no physical attraction to them. She is just there for the music.

But again no consideration to my feelings.

So a week passes and I get all these conflicting signals. 

Today she texted me and told me that she misses me while talking romantic walks through NY.

But then why did she leave me in the first place?

I don't get it.

Totally confused what is going on here.

So my question to all the ladies (perhaps men who experienced something similar); is this normal behavior when you are in the beginning of a relationship?

We talk through the week via text and phone. He calls after dark on weekends. I end up staying the night at his house Friday or Saturday night,  sometimes both. When we are together we end up talking until 3 or 4 a.m. sleep until noon or 1 pm and then I go home. And that is the extent of the relationship.

This got super long. TL;DR is at the end.

So, it's now been 18 months since I meet my (43f) incredible boyfriend ""G"" (33) on Bumble. 

Our relationship has continued to deepen and grow, which has been a beautiful experience for both of us. 

My life circumstances have changed dramatically since we met. Then I was a half-time mom. Hadn't planned on mixing kids and partner, figured I had plenty of time to see G when my kids were with their dad. Now I'm a 100% mom (girls 13 &amp; 10), and there's, unsurprisingly, been tons of turmoil involved in the transition for both me and the kids.

G has been patient and present and understanding to an extent which is hard for me to even understand. It is, of course, difficult for him though. I can't shake the feeling that he'd be better off finding someone whose life lines up with his better, with less drama, but he's very sure that he wants to be with me. 

There's also still the issue that he will most likely be moving away in the future. It probably won't be within the next few years though, and he will try his best to get a permanent position. I know I'm not cut out for a long distance relationship (we're already too far with 2 hours with public transport now), but I've had to tell myself that I'll at least try it if he does have to leave so that I can allow myself to love him like I feel compelled to do. Ninja mind tricks, I guess. Thinking that our end was almost certain felt like holding my thumb on a hose. It wasn't allowing me to let the relationship and love flow as it wanted to. (Sorry, it's so hard to talk about this stuff without sounding painfully sappy/cheesy.) G doesn't worry about the future because he feels certain it will work out and we'll be together. I'm trying to adopt that perspective.

Time will tell what's to come, but for now, it's the deepest, most harmonious love I've ever experienced and I'm just trying to suck it all in and enjoy the hell out of it. 

I'd appreciate any stories of life circumstances being difficult and working out any way, or of people deciding to part ways and things turning out well!

He's a great guy! We have so much fun together, we never argue, we respect each other's boundaries, spend lots of time together and our kids get along amazingly well. In short, things are great!

But, we are a year in and he hasn't said ""I love you"". I feel like he loves me and my daughter (13F) says all the time that she can tell how much he loves me... but the words mean a lot too. I'm the kind of person who says ""I love you"" to my daughter multiple times a day, every single time I hang up the phone with my mom, etc. It feels kind of unnatural for me not to say that to him as well, but everyone goes at their own pace so I have let it go, up until now.

Big question is... how do I figure out if he truly loves me without directly asking if he loves me? I definitely don't want to put him on the spot or make him uncomfortable... but I am starting to feel uncomfortable and need to know. I am not about to waste my time with someone who maybe just cares about me, but isn't in love with me a year into the relationship.

We've been taking it very slowly. I'm childless. She has a seven year old boy. Fairly recent ex and says doesn't want to introduce him to another guy so soon. 

Three months in and she's been taking her kiddo to the doctor for something and working and being a single mom, which is obviously all very time consuming. She went on a girls weekend. That's great. Said have an amazing weekend let's do something when you get back. 

Check in about the weekend and the doctor visit and if she's busy or not the next week and she's going on a wine tour with her ""other friend"", which I don't know what that means (likely from the girls weekend) but not really my business. We haven't had that exclusive talk and still aren't physical yet. 

I said I was hoping we could do the nice crab dinner I'd said I was going to make her (she mentioned liking crab) and she said it wasn't locked down and maybe she'd be available.

At this point I was probably a little annoyed she'd made more plans when I'd asked her to do something else and expected me to wait around in the hopes her plans fell through. I just decided I'd leave town and visit friends. 

I checked on her son once more and then went for the weekend to see friends. Decided to let her engage if she was interested. 

It's been 9 days since and she didn't write to say she was going to the winery or not. Didn't write to say how the doctor's visit went. Didn't check in to see how my weekend went and didn't reschedule.

I'm assuming that's just done, right? Continuing to contact someone who seems pretty disinterested or unsure isn't feeling great.

I (48F) connected with this guy (51M) on OLD about 1.5 years ago. I am single, have never been married, no kids while his long-term girlfriend passed away 5 years ago, no kids. We are living half the world apart. I normally connect only with people living in the same location but this guy is originally from my city. He used to travel back to my city at least twice per year before the pandemic. Due to travel restrictions and required lengthy quarantine, he already postponed his trip twice so we have not met in person yet. We promised to visit each other as soon as the travel restrictions are lifted. We have never video called but we had phone calls and voice messages many times. He didn't write much but he sent emojis every day. He loves to cook so he shared photos of his dishes and taught me how to make them through voice messages. On my birthday, he was the first to send me birthday greetings and called me right at midnight. When I was sad, he called to comfort me even when he was trying to get more sleep (we are 14 hours apart). I have slowly got used to hearing from him every day even if it was just an emoji. 

Since the beginning of this year, he hasn't been contacting me as much as last year. The daily emojis are gone but we had a few more lengthy phone calls. He then suddenly stopped texting me in mid-July. When I texted him, he doesn't reply. I don't want to pressure him so I hold myself not to text him too much; maybe just twice a month. Finally, he replied to my text in mid-August saying that something had happened and he doesn't have the mood to deal with anything. He didn't say what had happened though. Again, I didn't want him to feel annoyed and definitely didn't want to push him further away so I kept quiet even though I have been wishing for his text every morning. It's been over a month since he texted so I checked on him a few days ago but I haven't heard from him so far.

I’ve heard it before, but it resonated with my experiences this week. I thought I’d share some thoughts with you all as you plan out your dating adventures for the weekend.
   “If you want to know how someone really feels about you, don’t listen to their words.  Pay attention to their actions.”  A person you are interested in may tell you how beautiful and amazing you are. They may call you cute little nicknames such as honey, sweetie, babe, etc.  This can definitely be a good thing, and may make you feel all warm and fuzzy.  However, pay more attention as to how they show up in the relationship.  Do they make a concerted effort to make time for you?  Are they there for you when you have a difficult day?  Do they commit to you after several months, or years, of dating.  Do they include you with family and friends?
   Most of this sounds like common sense, right? However, it is easy to get stuck in a trap with an avoidant partner. The highs are so good, that you stick by the lows, you fall in love with the potential.
   I fell into this trap not really sure if it was avoidant issues, or the depression he suffered from.  Due to life circumstances of health and job loss due to business closures, I made allowances.  We had broken up a few times during low episodes, but tended to work things out.  I continued to be understanding.
   I ended up hurt in the end. I know I will be ok. My advice here is to know when to walk away. If an avoidant makes no effort, things will most likely not work out; especially if you are of the anxious attachment style. If they are depressed, that is a serious medical issue that shouldn’t be taken lightly. Again, if they aren’t willing to get help, it is unhealthy to stay in that relationship.  There is nothing wrong with supporting someone you really love. Love and support might feel encouraging for a partner to want to get help or work through their issues.  Just know your limits and be honest and open with that person. I may have hurt another dear person by releasing my own emotions, at an inappropriate time, after being hurt once again.  It could have been avoided with open communication.
