0,qqx9p0,1636559178,I don‚Äôt know why he is still in this relationship. Does he and he lack self esteem or is it much more than that ?,"
So him and this girl (21M,22F) have been dating for almost a year. It was all fine at the start but as they got into the relationship she started to become naggy. She has some sort of work all day and they spend time together at nights. She had her reasons to be mad. He‚Äôd play a lot of games( matches that takes 1-2 hours while making her wait on the other side saying it‚Äôll be over soon). He did not know how to keep his boundaries with his friends, can‚Äôt say no when it‚Äôs their time to his boys asking to come play games or his girl friend who wants to call him for hours. But after they fought about it he stopped doing those. 

She tried to break up with him during one of those fights but are still together. She is impatient and doesn‚Äôt know how to not be too invested in him. She has tried to break up with him several times now( 3 times from what I know ) when they fight big, doesn‚Äôt trust him and would get mad easily over small stuffs which leads to long small stressful fight.
He‚Äôs especially in a difficult spot rn, he had to go to college so it‚Äôs ldrs now. 

The thing is, even if he loves her, why would he be still with him knowing she is always having second thoughts about the relationship and would try to leave any time a big fight breaks out. He told me she‚Äôs warm and caring at other times and help him go through this difficult time. 
I don‚Äôt get why he can‚Äôt leave her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qqx9p0/i_dont_know_why_he_is_still_in_this_relationship/

I'm a whole foot shorter than my friend lol. He's older.  He's muscular. He's a super nice guy. And top it off, I'm bald too haha. I did wear a hat but she saw my bald ass head.

9,qqy05y,1636561257,My Adult Kids - None of YOUR business!!! Worry about yourself!!,"I gave birth to my older kids at 20 &amp; 24 years of age (too young). I was not a poster parent by any stretch of the imagination. But, I did the best I could as a single parent. Later down the road I got pregnant after a tubligation with my 3rd son, at the age of 33. I did thinks completely different with him, as I'd clearly had some training by this time.  

The reason for my post is I have a problem with guys that criticism me for how my older children act/their lack of helping me. One still lives at home, he's 24 and undiagnosed aspergers. The other is 28, 3 kids and a bipolar wife. He's got his hands full,  so I don't call on him often to help me with much. (It's not worth my DIL tantrums that's he's not home helping her) 

To that end, I don't really call on either of them much.  I survived mowing my lawn, doing many manly jobs for over 28 years, and happen to enjoy those things now. I hire help if it's too much for me, I can afford it.  

My youngest now almost 15 helps me with everything, all the time.  

My older two have the same dad,  he was out of the picture until 6 yrs ago. My youngest son's father passed when he was 5. 

Every guy I get close to criticism me about my parenting skills with my older two. I already beat myself up enough about that, so thanks for the reminder. 

I've even had a few say that's why they decided not to date me.  

I'm am a decent looking woman, with my shit completely together. Educated, financially stable, own a home of 29 yrs, two cars. 

I don't know what you guys want in a woman, or if my ability to mow my own damn yard is such a turn off you can't deal. I also cut down trees, remodel my home, fix my cars and appliances, so on...

But, I'm over the criticism, unless you feel like you can put my shoes on and walk through the last 28 years and come out alive and smiling.

I‚Äôve tried multiple dating app/sites, and only seem to get superficial people who don‚Äôt interest me very much.

I thought maybe I was doing something wrong but, for the life of me, I couldn‚Äôt figure out what.

46,qr146n,1636569784,Been seeing a great girl lately,"Some background: I‚Äôve been single for the last year after spending 3 years in a relationship with a girl who‚Äôs main goal was to criticize and emasculate me. Since then I‚Äôve had short-lived flings that ended abruptly. 

But I started seeing this girl for the last couple months who makes me feel really good in a few different ways. Maybe this is just because I‚Äôve been starved for this type of attention but I thought I‚Äôd share with you all.

First off, she‚Äôs pretty feminine, not only in the way she presents herself but she‚Äôs soft-spoken, warm, and go-with-the-flow. I never noticed how much I‚Äôm attracted to these qualities, especially after dating someone who constantly wanted to argue, prove me wrong, and control everything. 

She makes me feel masculine too. She even tells me that I am which was strange to hear at first but I think every guy wants to feel that way. She makes it clear she‚Äôs attracted to my masculine qualities, and doesn‚Äôt shame me or try to one-up me on masculinity. She‚Äôs really encouraging when I talk to her about my work too.

Then she does all these little things that I love: stroking my hair, touching my back/shoulders/arms, compliments me. This type of attention without being asked for is crazy to me.

Needless to say, the sex is hot af too.

She recently told me ‚ÄúI feel so spoiled by you with your great company and amazing sex‚Äù and I was taken aback cuz I‚Äôm just literally being myself. I feel like I‚Äôm the one being spoiled lol

I feel very relaxed when I‚Äôm around her, and for lack of a better word, I feel very manly. I‚Äôm realizing my ex girlfriend treated me more like a child.

47,qr1506,1636569847,How should I ask her out after sort of a drunken hookup?,"So i took this girl out on 2 dates and on the second date we basically fooled around in the backseat bc she wanted too, and she got really dirty and wanted to be choked, slapped, spit on etc. And she‚Äôs not like this in person at all, which is what I found surprising but we were drunk. We only didn‚Äôt have sex bc there wasn‚Äôt a condom around and so I just fingered her through her pants and all that good stuff. 

I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt have sex with her even though I maybe could have bc it would‚Äôve been bad bc we were drunk and I‚Äôm tall af and we were in this small cramped car. I‚Äôve known her for years and to see this side of her was interesting and amusing tbh.

Anyways, I message her the next day just kind of joking about the whole thing and how she left me marks on my neck, and it seemed like she was embarrassed and all she sent me was a facepalm and ‚Äúyikes.‚Äù That seemed pretty short but I said I‚Äôd forgive her, and she didn‚Äôt respond and I‚Äôm guessing it was like an embarrassment thing, bc she like did a 180 personality wise and said and did some things in the heat of the moment that are maybe out of character.

She told me she didn‚Äôt want a serious relationship, which I‚Äôm on board with, but I just don‚Äôt know how to ask her out again. Do I just ask her out like nothing happened, do I make a joke and then ask her out, like I don‚Äôt know which approach to take? 

I‚Äôd be a bit hurt if she didn‚Äôt want to have anything to do with me, but I feel like by not having sex and leaving on a high note (before dropping her off she kept telling me hot I was, and how basically turned on she was), there‚Äôs like room to find out more.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qr1506/how_should_i_ask_her_out_after_sort_of_a_drunken/

49,qr1exr,1636570620,Anniversary gift,"Hello everyone!

So, my boyfriend (19M) and I (18F) have been together for ten months now. The first six months, we spent almost all our time together, but now we're doing long distance. I'm visiting him at the end of December (my mom is coming with me because her fianc√©(my stepfather) and my partner live in the same house), and it is possible that my mom and I may not have to come back before our first anniversary (in that case I'd have to come home that day probably, but still at least we could spend a little time together on our special day). 

I had a slight idea of what I was gonna make for him, but when I told my sister about it, she said it was lame (i was gonna make a video montage of photos of us/him/I) Which I won't disagree with because it's really a common thing to do, but... I've already given him a painting of the two of us for Valentine's day and a hand-written letter. I've painted a portrait of him as his favorite video game character for his birthday and made him a Metal Gear Solid 3 poster kinda thing. I'm graduating this year, have a ton of studying to do and my days are long, I have like an hour free time outside of school on an average school day, so I don't have time to make something big that I can't just take with me everywhere, like that portrait and poster. I'd have a lot easier time with something I can carry with myself as I do have 2-3 hole hours each day, so the most important thing for me right now is for it to be something I can carry in my backpack and isn't messy!

I'm planning on buying an xbox (360) game for him for Christmas (if I can) because I saw how happy he was when he got to hold some of his favorite games in his hand instead of downloading it from somewhere else, so that's off the table too, and that's not something you give for an anniversary anyway. He already got a teddy bear from me and a dream catcher (those weren't handmade though...)

Now while writing this I had an idea- 
I saw this somewhere:
I have a ton of photos of him, and us together as I said. If I got a pretty notebook and filled it with sketches of those and wrote nice things in it,

Would that be good, along with or instead of the video (depending on how much time it will take)? That's something I could probably work on even if I'm not at home. I want to give him something great that's also not out of my reach...",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qr1exr/anniversary_gift/

She said that is so not how dating supposed to work and that's not how anybody she's ever dated every wanted to and blah blah blah. I pointed out that that's actually very common.

54,qr1rya,1636571599,My (22F) girlfriend wants me (26M) to stop watching porn," My 22F GF wants me 26M to stop watching porn. We are almost a year long in a long distance relationship and nevermets (in two months we should though). I am a virgin and she is my first girlfriend, she is neither. In the beginning of the relationship, she didn‚Äôt mind me watching porn, was not jealous and it was not an issue. But lately she said that if we lived together or got married, she doesn‚Äôt want me watching it anymore. I wasn‚Äôt sure how to take this because no one before has told me to not do something before that is so personal. For me, I do watch porn, but I don‚Äôt think it is any sort of addiction, I could drop it and be a celibate monk, if there was incentive (/r/nofap and /r/pornfree crowd claim there are benefits) to do so. 

I only watch porn while I fap, so stopping watching porn would effectively mean no masturbation. I know that some people can get off with their imagination, read erotica stories or audios but I heavily rely on visual stimulation (videos or pictures) to get turned on, spending 30 mins finding the right scene etc. I guess I could get off from pure physical stimulation alone if I had some crazy sex toy or doll 3000, but I am guessing the GF would be against that (I do use onaholes which she didn‚Äôt seem to mind though). My GF‚Äôs concern is mostly just porn with real people, she doesn‚Äôt like the unethical portion of porn and probably the comparisons I would make with her. So she recommended me to watch hentai instead (I do sometimes, but prefer real) or fap without porn. But like I said, I think I can only fap with porn. I tried fapping to sfw pictures and it took 45 mins to an hour and a half to get anywhere. I guess I could try to retrain my mind to fap without porn but not sure it‚Äôs worth it. I think as well I have developed a bit of mild death grip from fapping over 12 years, but I don‚Äôt have issues finishing when I want to and like to practice edging, or having extended sessions to prevent premature ejaculation. 

So if we are together in real life, I would imagine I could give up porn and fapping, if we are able to satisfy each other‚Äôs sexual needs and desires. Personally, I think I don‚Äôt have high or low libido or anything, I fap 2-4 times a week. I could stop if there was incentive to but I just ended up fapping most of the time because I get random bouts of horniness or just bored so rub one off, which I assume is common for most men, or not out of the ordinary. I have read that men and women in relationships tend to not give up personal mastrubation, for various reasons, so I‚Äôm not sure if it will be the case for me either. 

There is another issue that my GF currently has zero, low, or no libido at all. This is caused by SSRI antidepressants she takes for treating her anxiety. She was already taking meds when I started dating her, and her sex drive was at 40-60% of what she has when she wasn‚Äôt taking any medication. But when she started taking meds, she said she could not feel any pleasure from orgasms. In the start of our relationship, she would occasionally fap, not watch porn but listen to erotica audios or come up with scenarios (I bought vib for her to help her fap as she didn‚Äôt have one at her house at the time) and we would do sex calls a few in the early months of the relationships. I would occasionally initiate some sex calls (it seems weird to demand these thing, so I don‚Äôt tend to do so it made my GF thought that I was not interested in sexual thing with her but that is not the case). But now, fapping on her side and intimate calls have completely been absent. She is disgusted by porn, hates humiliating sex acts (but she always had), and most nsfw things now. She is trying to switch her medication to see if it has any effects with restoring her libido, about two weeks ago, but nothing has changed much since, and says her libido is at rock bottom again like when she started her antidepressants for the first time.

So one scenario I can imagine happening when we meet or live together for a long time is this: I am interested in initiating sex because I am horny or have some desires. First option, she is interested or she is not interested but willing to follow up when I ask. Option 2, she is not in the mood and refuses. I then either have to repress any urges since she will not allow me to watch porn around her, therefore I cannot masturbate for sexual relief. Even if I try to circumvent this restriction clause, like watching hentai, I have a suspicion that she would not like this eventually either. Fapping without visual stimulation at all seems like it would be very unenjoyable to me, due to not getting turned enough, or taking hours to finish. But I guess it is an option and is possible. For the second scenario, the act of being rejected would make one not feel good and undesired, which I or my GF would probably not look forward to. Feels like /r/deadbedrooms even though I have never met my partner yet. And yes, therapy is always an option. All of this is sort of theoretical and contingent how I think sex in relationships work because I really have no idea, being an inexperienced virgin. 

Tl;dr So in some sense, I feel as though my GF is being a bit controlling with me but I understand where it comes from. I am willing to compromise and make changes to accommodate her requests or wants but I am not exactly thrilled or happy either. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm upset with anything in particular but having a sense that something is not clicking or matching with our mindsets. I have an itching premonition that all of these things won‚Äôt simply resolve themselves when we meet in person.

62,qr2oz1,1636574176,Feels like it was going well but she answers messages long after receiving them. Confused af,"This is a rant/vent post so beware.  
  
  
Recently I met this girl at my job. We got along really well and each shift with her we laughed a lot and she always insisted on getting a hug and such, seemed to enjoy being with each other. What also happened recently, but a bit more recently, is I quit. Me and almost all the other waiters at the restaurant (boss is f*cked in the head). The remaining waiters got some ice cream coupons and were told they've been great as of late. Transparent af but yeah.  
  
  

Anyways me, her and 2 others from the workplace went together and had a nice time at the ice cream place. Afterwards me and her walked all the way to her house together, and had a good time. She gave me hot water in a cup to keep me warm on my way home too lol.  
  
  

So yea, we said we'll be in touch and I definitely wanted to because she is different from what I'm used to and makes me feel comfortable. But when I text her, she responds a lot of time later. Like.. my last text asking how's the shift going went unnoticed and it's a day and half old. I know she might be busy, I don't mind it that much, but I don't think she's that busy to answer, we're young and all she does is work, she has breaks (I worked the same hours) during work and isn't the type to not check texts. 
  
  
Also don't worry, I'm not letting my self get obsessed, I'm just truly confused as to why she answers so late. The connotation of ghosting is a lack of interest, but doesn't feel to be the case (can't know for sure but still).

Her (20F) and I met online while attending universities in the same city. We decided to meet up. 3-4 long dates went well, we discovered we have very different backgrounds and different life experiences but I found her interesting and kind. 

I then went back home for an extended week long holiday. At one point over messages we started discussing our previous love lives and found them quite different.

I've had 1 pervious girlfriend (highschool) and 1 friend with benefits (that ended in less that month). The girl rightly pointed that I didn't seem like a person to have FWB, which is true, I really didn't enjoy it and pretty much told her I'm never doing it again.

She on the other hand said she's been only having friends with benefits in the last 4 years since her one and only relationship. 

Long story short I come back and we start spending an absurd amount of time together (like almost 30 hours in a row). I've been introduced to more and more of her friends, moving along the bases, everything seemed good to me. 

However one the other evening we have been having pillow talk and what she said essentially boiled down to ""you will remember me, but I don't know if I will"" and admitted she had once had trouble of having multiple FWBs at once. However, after a nap all that was forgotten and everything went back to normal.

82,qr53jj,1636580896,I feel like I didn't have a propper adolescence and now I don't know how to hit on people.,"I'm a 20y het male.  I've always been a very horny guy, but also very reserved, in a way most people don't really suspect that. I've never been really interested in an actual ""dating relationship"", but for I sure desire more open-type relatioships with people.

In my teenage years, I've never really went after girls. Few girls I'd met at that time actually peaked my interest, and I didn't have a hope they'd be interested in me, so I just didn't do anything. I acted like this for my whole adolescence. When I went to college (at 17), that changed. Now, there was lots of girls that interested me, but I didn't have a clue on how to interact with them without being creepy. It's not a case of not being able to interact with women very well; I have women friends. Mostly because of me being extremely shy, and also because I always think I'll be bothering a stranger by interacting with them so unexpectedly, I just kept not taking action. Like, ever. It doesn't help that I'm already terrible at interacting with strangers in general.

I had one year of college and then the pandemic hit. I spent this year and 2020 almost not getting out of home. I'll just have 8 months of presential college next year, and it's gonna be the last one. I have this feeling that there's this big part of my life that I've been missing out on, as my youth fades away. I don't wanna be exxagerated, but I wanna be able to actually hit on people in the time that I have.

When I search for stuff like this, it always seems so complex. Online articles make it seem like hitting on women is this very hard equation, in which you have to pay attention to every little thing you say and be strategic, but I suspect it isn't actually like that.

So, how do you go on talk with a stranger you have interest in? In a realistic way, how does it happen to you? How to know if you're bothering them?

88,qr5jyq,1636582160,Girl at Subway,"I (26m) have been popping into a Subway (the sandwich chain) for the past few months now because its local to my uni. I'm a fairly introverted person by nature, although I don't have social anxiety or anything like that as I'm confident around people generally, I'm just not an extrovert so I don't go out of my way much to make interactions with people. I'm also very inexperienced with women. So I'm gonna need some help to make sense of this situation.

I was in the queue minding my own business one day and the girl serving behind the counter was giving me, I felt at least, very intentense eye contact as if she were starring deeply into me. I think she's absolutely beautiful and to be honest, she's exactly my type. I didn't really know what to think at first so I just assumed she was being a friendly member of staff. However, she seemed very polite and I could tell her voice was becoming very soft and feminine but she wasn't holding eye contact with me, I could feel some awkwardness as I too looked away most of the time when she looked at me because her gaze was very piercing but again I always assume its not what I think it is and she's just being polite.

After we briefly spoke about my order and moved onto the next customer behind me I turned to face away from her and move further down the queue and I heard her say something in her soft voice (my hearing is terrible by the way and it's getting worse for some reason) which think she said ""thankyou"" to me and I turn back round to her and there was looking at me with a slight shy smile. I didn't know how to respond and because of my bad hearing I wasn't entirely sure what she said so I just blanked as if I didn't hear her, and by now the next customer had already started ordering. Plus, ""thankyou""? Isn't that a weird thing to say when I hadn't given her anything or said anything other than my order.

The next time I was there I was being served by a different female staff member and as I was paying for my order my girl comes out one of the employee doors and stands right next to me. She starts talking to the girl serving me and we glance eye contact a few times. She hurries off before I finish paying and then when i turn around and go to the entrance she's there in the way and we hold eye contact for a brief couple of seconds. I always feel she's got a very slight snd shy smile when she looks at me, but maybe she is too shy to say or do something, basically like me haha, although I'm not anxious at all or shy really I'm just not sure if I'm reading this right.

The last time I've seen her was just today. I was being served by another female employee who was clearly new. I noticed my girl was in the back and she noticed me being served - we made very brief eye contact and I think she recognised my voice (I have a very deep voice). The new girl, lovely and pleasant as she was, was struggling with the order and my girl rushed out to help her, she would occasionally glance up at me and I decided to hold eye contact when she did so. She went back into the back room and would constantly ask the new girl if she needed any help and in the end it was her who ended up serving me at the till/cash register (for you yanks out there). The new girl apologised for being slow with the order and I told her it was no trouble at all, I thanked them both and me and my girl made eye contact again and she told me to take care and I left.

I've had what i believe to be similar scenarios like this happen to me over the years but I'd always either chicken out or assume there was no attraction and it was all in my head, like just the other day another girl at the subway gave me free cookies because my card wouldn't work on the machine and another girl at my uni offered me a sweet out of the blue. I would think ""they want me"" but they probably don't and were just being decent people. If I've learned anything in life its not to build your hopes up too much and always expect things won't always go your way or aren't always in your favour - it helps alleviate some stress and relaxes you in the realisation that you can't control everything, even other people's attraction to you.

Anyway, sorry for long rant but there's just something about this girl, man. If there genuinely is some attraction on her part then I'd definitely pursue this further. In my opinion i think shes quite shy and seems a little bit nervous for some reason. For any women out there reading this, what do you think? I'd love to get your take. Even if she doesn't like me and its all in my head, I'd love to at least make her day and make her smile or laugh, any suggestions?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qr5jyq/girl_at_subway/

90,qr5nl6,1636582439,"Confused on lack of making things ""official"", seeking insights","I (30F) met a great guy (27M) some months back to collaborate with on a project (ie. we did not meet under romantic circumstances). We ended up hitting things off really well and it wasn't long before I found I really liked him and was starting to get romantic feelings for him. While his actions seem to indicate feelings are mutual, I'm struggling at times with mixed signals and was curious what you guys might think.

While we're still working on our project, we generally meet up two to three times a week and will spend anywhere from two to six hours together -- be it sitting and talking or going out to dinner. We'll generally go out to eat 3-4 times a month, and occasionally follow up dinner with drinks (we also alternate who covers dinner, if that's at all relevant). We've talked about past relationships, what we're looking for now, family, friends, morals, careers, and so on. There's not much between us that hasn't been discussed, and we're very much on the same page with what we want in life and what our long-term goals are. I've been to his house and finally got him to visit mine recently, we've hugged, we regularly go out in public together, our mutual and personal friends know we hang out, and I've attended a church service with him (I'm not religious).

The hang-up: he has to be the one to engage an activity proposal. Any time I've invited him to do anything, I get a polite declination or he freezes up. I've been turned down four times now and I'm kind of at a loss of how to proceed there. He seems to be much more comfortable being the one to set the pace of things and he seems to actively work at building his confidence and pushing things along...which has been fine for the most part, but I feel like we've literally been on the cusp of actually dating that I don't know why he hasn't just bit the bullet and had the conversation with me. I'm honestly hesitant to be the one to do it since I'm a little chagrined from my invitations being turned down, and logically I know it's better to know than sit here wondering day in and day out.

So what do you think? Give him a little more time to muster up his courage? Should I just take the plunge and bring it up? Is there something I'm missing and I'm misreading him? Are we just two awkward boobs who are too shy to ask the other out?

Sidenote: yes, I'm positive he's single and not seeing anybody.

94,qr643f,1636583655,Does being in a relationship actually make you happier/improve your life?,"I'm 25F, never dated anyone, never kissed anyone, never even held anyone's hand. I don't know ANYTHING about dating. I have recently tried to start dating and have been making a consistent effort on the apps, asking friends to set me up, etc. because since I was 20 I really have wanted to be with someone (I am a very late bloomer lol). Lots of reasons why I haven't yet including low self esteem, immigrant family, hyperfocused on school/work, going to uni in a pretty racist place, etc etc 

I'm trying to find someone I want to date but so far it hasn't happened. and I can't help but think - is this even worth it?? I've lived without ever having someone like me/have a crush on me, without ever having a partner, without ever even being touched - do I really need to keep trying so hard? I do think I want this - I get really lonely and sad sometimes and I am now comfortable with myself and I think I have a lot to offer in a relationship. And the rest of my life is going pretty well, I finally feel like I have the capacity to think about this. But at the same time I keep thinking maybe I should stop trying because if it hasn't happened yet, maybe it's just not for me and I should focus on things that I can actually succeed at (like more career stuff, my friendships, etc - although all my friends are in relationships now so I don't see them as much anyway/they have other priorities). 

I might take a break from this but I don't know if it should be forever lol. Does dating really making your life better? My guess is yes because people focus so much on it and all my friends seem so much happier now that they're in relationships and it would be cool to matter to someone after all my friends have moved on and it would be cool to be a priority in someone's life... but really does it matter???? I know I'm responsible for my own happiness and I do a pretty good job of managing that, wouldn't put that responsibility on another person, but does it enhance your happiness or wellbeing to be with someone??? Please help, I actually have never experienced anything remotely close to this so I don't know what it would be like if I did. I don't know if it's worth wanting anymore.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qr643f/does_being_in_a_relationship_actually_make_you/
95,qr65z4,1636583805,im in a confusing situation,"Sorry this is kinda long, details kinda are important, tl;dr at bottom tho. There is a girl in two of my classes (we're both 16), and I realize I have a bit of a crush on her. So I start to pay attention to her out of the corner of my eye, and I realize she stares back, and quite frequently. Her eyes will linger for a moment if she turns her head, she'll glance over, and glance again shortly after, she'll look over after laughing with friends, she'll look over her shoulder if she passes me in the hall, and sometimes she'll just stare for a few seconds.

We'll make eye contact a few times each class, and usually she looks away quickly. I try to never stare directly at her, I only look at her if I think she's looking first, so I'm not creepy.

I see this, and I go over to her table in physics, as I have some friends there and we are allowed to move around for assignments. We have to explain to the class how to do problems on the assignment, and the first day when I asked if I should stay or go back to my other seat, she's the first one to tell me to stay. I had a friend invite me over one class, and she was leaning over the table to see if I was coming or not. There is another girl at the table, and whenever the other girl was talking, she would glance back at me repeatedly to see how much I was listening to the other girl, and seemed slightly put off if I was. There also was a time where a sub said my last name wrong (it's polish so it's spelled weird), and she noticed and made a comment about it. I wasn't at her table when the sub said it wrong, so she was paying attention to me even when I wasn't over there and enough to know the correct pronunciation. We could make good conversation, I could get her to laugh, and we do have a good deal in common. She is a shy person, she sometimes talks really quietly, but she never really was shy around me.

So, at this point all I see are signs she's interested. I ask for her number one thursday, and immediately text her so she has my number. That weekend I text her about soccer, as we both play soccer. No response. I checked with a mutual friend and it is the correct number, but that friend said that on occasion she hasn't gotten a response either. The issue is, we moved seats and she no longer sits with friends so I don't have an excuse to go and talk to her. A week after, I managed to catch her after class and I asked her why she didn't respond. She said she was at a soccer game so she couldn't respond, but she did apologize quite a bit.

The really weird thing is that that week and the week after she was staring more than usual. There was a time when my group was behind her group, and she repeatedly looked over her shoulder back at my group, and when I moved behind her other shoulder she started looking over that shoulder. In the first class, whenever she gave thoughts on a poem she was looking at me out of the corner of her eye and not the at teacher, and she did that every time she gave thoughts to the class last week. She would look at the floor in front of me when she presented in physics, and she would lean over her table to watch my group present, and she wouldn't do that for other groups. She also was glancing over more frequently, and sometimes would turn her head, linger on me for a moment, and then look at something completely unrelated to the class like a wall behind her. She also would mess with her hair a few times each class, and straighten up her clothes when she presented in physics. Even today, she was leaning over her friend repeatedly to take a look.

I only see two options, and neither make sense.

She's interested, but shy. This explains the staring, but not the texting.

She's just being nice, which explains the texting, but not the staring.

So idk wth to do, I'd talk to her about it but it's unlikely we'll end up nearby for the next two days, and I don't have a guarantee she'll respond to another text. I'm sick of thinking about this, so I was thinking about texting her tonight, to ask her if she didn't respond because she doesn't want me to text her, but i'd rather do it in person.

tl;dr crush stares back A LOT, is friendly when I talk to her, seems to want me to be around her, but then didn't respond to a text. after the text, she was staring even more.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qr65z4/im_in_a_confusing_situation/
