1,s3h9m7,1642128647,Not feeling the sparks,"I recently got a new job and met this girl I work with. I could tell she liked me from the moment we met because her face turned bright red like a tomato. She giggles at everything I say. Over the past couple weeks we started sleeping together, but everytime I want to take the plunge she falls asleep on me, or wants it from me when I'm not in the mood anymore. Needless to say it's been difficult for me to really feel into it.

Before this I was single for 5 years including abstinence because I had to work on myself and my sobriety. Now I want to date again, and I really want to like this girl, but I'm not feeling it in bed. It's either I have a sexual block or there are simply no sparks between us.

It's really difficult for me to understand because we rough house and play with each other, we've slept together, we cuddle, but I just can't get into the mood to commit to sex.

To add a little detail she lays in bed dead asleep acting like she wants me to just take her and fuck. She tells me I should wake her up and just do it, but my sex drive doesn't operate like thay. I need foreplay and there just isn't any. I try to give her foreplay and she just lays there... Sometimes she just falls asleep and snores. I'm not feeling it.

I'm wondering if this is a me problem, a sexual block, or maybe the sparks just aren't there? I need your opinions Reddit.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s3h9m7/not_feeling_the_sparks/

Fast forward to today I discovered he was in contact with a girl (ex girlfriend that he never ended things with) for the past 9 months that we were talking, this guy never told me anything about the way he felt about me, hence whenever we were talking he was always referring to me as a future thing. 
When I discovered all of this and faced him with the facts he told me it‚Äôs an unhealed love he‚Äôs trying to get rid off and told me the truth that he was talking to her even when we‚Äôre were talking because at some points he felt like he misses her

So basically Alex is when someone falls in love with you i mean really in love with you but you just cant seem to love them the same way now theres a clear difference to having someone like you and you just not give a fuck and hen theres them liking you or loving you and you wanting to return the same feelings but your unable to 


Now Rex however is the complete opposite of Alex the story of rex goes that Rex basically likes this girl that sits next to him in this class and i mean they talk and what not they exchanged numbers you know there friends now over time Rex actually develops a type of love for this said girl and valentines day is coming up so he plans out everything hes gonna do. So valentines day comes around and hes getting ready to ask the girl to be his valentines but then he sees her go to someone else someone whos a lot better then him in all aspects and at that point Rex onew that no matter how much he loved this girl she was never gonna love him back the same way he does. Basically Rex is the feeling of loving someone and i mean with all your heart but knowing damn well they will never love you back the same way

15,s3io3y,1642132739,My Friend (26M) won't date me (27F) because he thinks I'm too good for him and it's so frustrating.," My friend (let's call him ""N"") proclaimed his feelings for me a few years ago (told me how he always imagined us together) and we kissed. We had been platonic friends for two years at this point. I was ecstatic when he told me because I always really enjoyed spending time with him, we had incredible chemistry, and I felt like we brought out the best in each other and was looking forward to exploring a romantic side. Immediately after he told me he started avoiding me, acting distant and telling me that maybe we shouldn't go down the dating route. I was heartbroken but respected his wishes. In the months after that our friendship had completely shifted, even though he told me he didn't want to date he still tried initiating sex and tried hooking up with me. After a couple months of this back and forth, I told him I didn't want to be strung along like this and told him either he commits to dating me or we need space from each other for a while. He broke down and told me, and I quote, ""You're too good for me, I sit on the couch and eat ramen while you travel and make money, I'm only going to hold you back."" It was honestly one of those most gut wrenching moments because I swear I always thought we would be perfect together and I always voiced to him how much I cared about him. Since then we have both dated other people, but the what-if of ""what if N and I actually gave each other a shot"" is always in the back of my mind.

I don't think I'm perfect nor do I think I am out of his league or ""too good for him"" but I (27F) make six figures while he (26M) is still in school and I understand he is insecure financially which I think is the main point of his insecurity. I never made him feel bad about this, and on the contrary, always supported his dreams and ambitions and paid for our activities together cause I knew he was low on cash. He always makes jealous, passive aggressive comments about the guys I do date like: ""wow you hit the jackpot with that dreamy boyfriend"" or ""I'm happy you finally found someone worthy of your time.""

We slept together recently (for the first time!) after I drove down to the city he lives in for a super romantic weekend and while we were being intimate N said ""thanks for slumming it with the peasants"" and it completely ruined the moment. We've had sex a couple of times after this and he always makes these kinds of comments and it makes sex uncomfortable and I feel like I can't even be myself around him anymore and that the real intimacy is just not there. I really do feel like we've just gotten into this really crappy positive feedback loop and our time together is not playful or fun like it used to be. I just really don't know how to convey I care for him and want to date him because I'm just scared his insecurities will stop him from pursuing a relationship with me. It's just been hard to see him date other girls the last while, because it feels like he will give other girls an actual chance and wont take the chance on me. I desperately want to tell him how I feel I just don't know how because we live in different cities and he just never really seems to make the effort to pursue anything with me. I just don't know what to do, I'm not sure if I should put all the cards out on the table and let him know how i feel because then maybe he will feel comfortable opening up too or maybe just understanding he probably is just not that into me.

24,s3jmve,1642135663,Ask out a not-very-close sort-of friend - not sure if she's interested.,"There's a woman who is the ex-wife of a friend-of-a-friend.  (they split 2-3 years ago). 

We've met a few times at birthday parties and the like, and we know each other's names and have chatted several times.  We hug as a greeting every time, and one time we left a party to go to an after party (a month ago) and she rested her hand on my arm - all this to say that she doesn't seem to find me repulsive. 

Now that I'm single, I'd like to ask her out for a coffee/conversation sort of thing, more to see if we have more than just surface stuff in common.   She's ~50 and I'm a few years younger. 

The questions:

1, I only have her on LinkedIn &amp; corporate email - I'm not sure if it's kosher to use either for a personal thing. 

2, I'd like to ask in an easy and non-embarrassing way to shoot down, if she's not interested, without anything becoming awkward. 

Something like

&gt; Hi [person], it's been a few weeks since we met at [other person] dinner, and I feel we didn't get to chat enough.  If you have a free hour this week, want to grab a coffee?


In my mind, if she's not interested, she'd be like ""sorry, I'm busy this week"" and that's that. 

If she's interested, she'll agree to meet, or ""I can't this week, but how about next?"" etc.   From there, I should be able to discern if a ""you want to do this again sometime?"" is appropriate or not.

They were his friend group first. But over time started inviting me and hanging with me 1 on 1.
Anyway, one of his friends asked me to come to discuss some business stuff we're doing together.

I have been kinda depressed lately and wasn't feeling going too much, but I figured if my bf wanted me to come I'd try to and socialize.
So I asked him, I was like ""I don't know if I wanna go or not yet, but would you want me to come?""
He said ""I don't care your choice""
And I was just like ""yes or no""
And he said ""I mean if you're just gonna be sad the whole time no""

And idk I just felt really bad. I didn't need him to say yes, but I wish instead of just never talking to me about my depression and getting annoyed with he, maybe he could check on me.
He listens if I bring it up, I even posted about how depressed I've felt on my small private snap story (with like 5 ppl or so, close friends) and how I tell people and nobody cares or does anything or even checks on me. 

I don't expect the world, or him to revolve around me.
And yes it is a me problem that I deal with this. I rarely talk about the extent of how depressed I am. So when I do it's when it's getting really bad.

Also it's not like I don't work on myself and let the depression consume me. I have MDD, and so sometimes it's really hard. 
I don't take medication (been on and off for years) through different therapists. 
I workout, I try to eat good, I meditate. I've worked so fucking hard to just be happy. 
To just, exist. And I'm so tired. And sometimes I feel like I'm drowning. And I just want him, or anyone to be there.

39,s3kbu1,1642137792,Giving my neighbor crush my number in a small note. Bad idea?,"Okay, so here‚Äôs a bit of backstory: 

I‚Äôm a 27 year old male who has never been a ladies man, as they say. I‚Äôve been in a couple of long term relationships in the past but this is the first I‚Äôve been single in a while. I‚Äôm reasonably attractive(I think), fit, confident enough in conversations with women, and I‚Äôm fine with being myself and not being overly flirty or borderline obnoxious like I often see shameless other men act when approaching women in public. Anyway, I moved into my apartment complex last summer and began going to the on-site gym, when shortly after that I started seeing this female resident go regularly as well, around the same time I do. Sure enough, I began seeing her in our parking garage and realized she lives on the same floor and I‚Äôve kind of had instances where I‚Äôll be going to my car as she is leaving her‚Äôs and vice versa.

Long story short, it‚Äôs been months and I see her a few times a week. I‚Äôve been interested in her from the moment I laid eyes on her, but I‚Äôve never really had a good opportunity to approach her without seeming too forward or possibly making her uncomfortable, and I‚Äôm NOT going to strike up a conversation in the parking garage because that‚Äôs weird. In the gym, she almost always has headphones on, so it isn‚Äôt easy there either. Attempts at making eye contact don‚Äôt go super well because she seems to be the type that avoids looking directly at anybody at gym, and seeing as females tend to get hit on when at the gym a lot, i can totally understand why. 

Anyways, my sister, who is in her early 20s told me that as an alternative to interrupting her workout, it may not be a terrible idea to simply write a small note saying something like ‚Äúhi, I don‚Äôt normally do this but I didn‚Äôt want to interrupt your work out. If you‚Äôre interested: ‚Äú and then write my name (first and last so she can creep on FB to see who I am if she wants; it‚Äôs 2022 and I know people do that) and then include my number. The on site gym is very small, so it‚Äôs easy to know which belongings are hers when she sets them down, as there is a bench or two that folks usually put their keys or jackets on when working out, so I would just leave it with her things before I leave. 

My question is: is this creepy? I have never done anything like this but personally I would find it cute if a woman did this to me, but I‚Äôm also very down to earth and open minded so I don‚Äôt find things like that to be that weird if done subtly and not over the top. 

Ladies, any opinions? Should I just wait for the right time to approach her in person? I should mention that she has appeared in my ‚Äúpeople you may know‚Äù on FB I‚Äôm guessing because she has friends that have mutual friends with me(and because FB is creepy as hell like that) and I‚Äôve seen her profile as listing her as single. I refuse to reach out on there because frankly that IS creepy and I wouldn‚Äôt like that myself.

If you make repeated üëÄ contact with someone in a public setting there's a 85% chance you are catching their eye.... LITERALLY!!! 10% chance their disassociating, and 5% they need help with something... 
^^still good odds. ü§ì

70% of my personal encounters of being approached by a M25+ in public has been creepy.18% were Gen X &amp; Boomers striking casual conversation (both M&amp;F)... 7% were from female femists (women who respect other women). 5% remain of people who were too intoxicated to introduce themselves. Hopefully I'm not alone in these kinds of encounters!?!

Anyways if your still reading...

ASK/TALK TO THEM  üó£
Their opinion on something physically related to the interaction ""meet-cute""... The menu, artist, an item/ activity. OR compliment their style, pet, book, merch they're wearing etc. 

We all SENSE bad engery/vibes&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; trauma. (The majority of us have it functioning in today's society.) WHYYY is it so hard to act on the good vibes?! They DO exist, right? üòÖ 

My next relationship will to consist of communication, genuine connection, physical and internal attraction. This is why I identify as pansexual*... my preference is mainly still cisgender males.
^daddy issues am I right? 

The pandemic made me realize humans are the virus. We are past the point of, you know...CASUAL SEX. When someone asks to hookup, immediately I think *Let me spread my seed &amp; grow your egg"". üòÇüòÇ

Women are over hookup culture!! I say woman, as my childhood as a *girl* was short lived &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; que more trauma lol. I no longer identify as a *girl* looking for a *boy* (maturity i think?)

I crave communication, connection, emotions,  intamacy with another soul!! Who üëÄ and appreciates me, both internally and externally. Yet very few take the chance to even approach me (conversing with a stranger).

If you made it this far Self CONFIDENCE IS ATTRACTIVE, ""alpha"" dominance &amp; femine insecurity is not. ü§Æ

my problem is i actually like him. and he doesnt seem to like me that way. but i've been in love with him for years. his face and personality are ideal to me. there's so much we've been through.

we never ended up having sex, which im thankful for. i feel like i would have regret it. he started seeing a new girlfriend and told me since we were sexual he can't speak to me while he's dating her. his last gf was jealous of him talking to female friends and as soon as they broke up he messaged me apologizing for his absence and took me out to eat and bought me a sex toy and finger fucked me in his car.

i dont know why i love him so much. there's something about him thats so special and i havent felt that about any guy. he doesnt like me romantically only sexually.

I (F) hooked up with a guy from Tinder who was literally the most handsome guy I‚Äôve met. He‚Äôs everything I ever wanted from a guy - taller than me, very muscular, handsome, confident.

We slept on the 2nd date when I went to his place to watch a movie, and it was quite clear from his part that he only wanted sex, although he was indirect about it. The 1st date we went somewhere out.

When I made the move for the foreplay (I sat on his lap, grinded on him, we made out), I _did get wet_ , but I didn‚Äôt feel _horny_ or aroused? Sounds dumb.

It didn‚Äôt get better even when he started giving me head. I did get aroused a little but I swear if I‚Äôm alone with my toys, I literally have a feeling that I _need_ something in me. It‚Äôs really strong. I didn‚Äôt have **any** of that with him.

**No judgment for the following please, but it‚Äôs an important point to make IMO** :I‚Äôm surprised this happened because a few years ago I used to grind on guys in clubs and I always got wet and aroused in the moment.

1) Is it really possible that for some dumb reason, although he‚Äôs hot af, the sexual energy/chemistry between us is lacking? Why? I used to hookup with a guy who‚Äôs ‚Äúless attractive‚Äù per se, but even the way he touched my neck or back gave me shivers and I got turned on (before any foreplay).

2) Maybe this can also affect why I didn‚Äôt get that aroused, but idk: All he did during the foreplay was basically just kiss me back when I was sitting on his lap, kiss my neck here and there, and that‚Äôs basically it. He didn‚Äôt grind himself back to me when I did it, he didn‚Äôt really tease me by touching me down there through clothes. I teased him a lot and basically waited for him to do the same but it didn‚Äôt happen. Could this also influence the experience, that it felt like the foreplay was for me only and he kinda rushed it?

One night, he introduced me to some people our age, including a guy named Jim. I was heavily drinking that night, and Jim was flirting with me while I was falling asleep, putting his hand around my waist and things like that. He even bought me a water. 

I had to get taken back to my room that night. All I know is that Jim started talking about wanting to hook up with me. John got mad at Jim and said he couldn't because he liked me. 

Everyone told me what he said after. I asked John myself, but he actually had a girlfriend the entire time. 

Later that day, John had left already, but everyone else was still there. We were all sitting at a table, and I was quiet because I was embarrassed because everyone knew that I asked John. Jim asked me why I was so quiet, and then what I liked to do. 

I tried requesting John on Instagram thinking we could be social media friends at first. He left the request pending, and then rejected it. I got really upset and blocked him. I'm pretty sure he told everyone I blocked him, because Jim messaged me the next day asking if I was alright. 

Jim and I are still social media friends, and John broke up with his girlfriend two months after we met. We're still not in contact, but he watches all of my social media. Whether it be Twitter,  TikTok, etc., he's always the first to view my content. Why is that? And what really happened? Did John ever actually like me? Was he jealous of Jim? Trying to be protective over me? Did Jim like me? Or just want to hook up with me?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s3mzpp/confused_about_what_really_happened/

That date was supposed to be last week Wednesday but we couldn't because she caught COVID. Now that she's recovered I asked her for a rescheduling of the date and she said that she was busy with her exams and she would be available after the 1st of February.

Literally everywhere I look on Reddit or the internet people say ""Oh, if a girl is really into you she'll make time for you"" but I'm wondering; Is it not possible that she's ACTUALLY busy and I'm just not that big of a deal in her life yet since we hardly know each other?

We had an amazing first date and thing always was going really well in the second date. However, when I proposed to have sex and me ‚Äúeating her out‚Äù. I told her that I‚Äôm not experienced that I only had sex one time before. She seems to be very surprised and she asked if that‚Äôs the reason why I wanted to date her. I realized that I messed up and I told her it‚Äôs because I think she is very attractive. The mood is definitely ruined and we ended up just made our a little more and I drove her home. She can tell I‚Äôm pretty frustrated bc I told her my experience and ruined the mood. She kept telling me that ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not weird‚Äù.

The next day she drunk texted me while she is out with her roommate. She said she is very anxious when she is around guys just for her looks. I really like her personality as well so I told her that I‚Äôm attracted to both her look and her personality. 

However, after that night I can tell the flame just started to go away. She is less enthusiastic about conversations and I‚Äôm also pulling away because I started to doubt if she still likes me. I tried to ask her out again but she is always ‚Äúbusy with work and roommate‚Äù. 

After about a week since our second date, she send me some messages to tell me she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt have the time to see someone seriously but she really likes me‚Äù. I think I handled the situation pretty well by saying that I don‚Äôt want to be friends if she doesn‚Äôt want to date me. We ended up being very straightforward about our needs and ended things. But I‚Äôm very confused why she kept saying ‚Äúto be honest/obviously I really like you‚Äù in the messages where we are ending things. I think it‚Äôs pretty much a lie and it‚Äôs better if she can just tell me that if I should not told her my experience so I can be better at dates next time.

Some suggest that we make the first move instead of them. Using Valentine's Day as an example, how best can we make that first move and be proactive?

V-day since it's the supposedly romantic day that we will be capitalising on in a month's time.

I've never celebrated VDay cuz I find it dumb. Also I've been single 30 years. Only participated in V-Day celebrations in school where I'll buy chocolates for everyone of my friends cuz other students were selling them for a fund raiser. Typical stuff. Also cuz it's dumb. &amp; chocolate is life.
 
Thanks to Covid, being stuck at home for the most of it, makes you want to celebrate shite you don't normally do. And there are increasingly more people who got involved with online dating, yours truly included.

I don't know where I stand with this person I'm talking to. Contextually, we are pretty intimate via text. &amp; will only be meeting up sometime this year. We've been 'together' for a year now &amp; I'm considering making the first move after reading through multiple posts of men suggesting maybe everyone else (ie women) to make the first move.

Now people always say ""work on yourself"" as a blanket statement to people who are single. I say that's wrong. If you're a 1994 Toyota Camry, no matter how many curls you do, you will still have the bones and the heart of a Camry, you will never be a Ferrari. But you can leverage your naturally born advantages and be the best camry you can be, by being fuel efficient, reliable and spacious. 

Perhaps you're interested in finding your human, and you as the camry that you are put yourself on Craigslist or Marketplace. Now there's no point trying to DM someone and sell yourself to someone looking for a Dodge Challenger, that's just not what they're looking for and there's nothing wrong with you. 

Now yes, you can slap a turbo in there, do weight reduction mods and blow that challenger out of the park with all the mods but if they're looking for a challenger they still won't be saving you in the wishlist. 

So what do we do? 
First of all, find out what we are. Are we a sportscar, a truck or are we a family car? 
Second, figure out our market price? How much is someone like me going for in the market?
Third, leverage your natural advantages and be the best model you can. 
Four, put yourself in a market segment that is most likely to attract the buyer you're looking for. 
Lastly, network and advertise.

You thoughts?,"that is how I fee curentlyl. Im 28m. If a women shows intention on another date and has a good reason why she cant figure out the next date at the moment and says they will followup then I'll give them minimum a week and then maybe bring it up again. To me its a bit of a test. Will they treat my time and my feelings with respect or will they string me along? Are they going to continue responding to my text but act flaky on setting up dates? If so after a week I dont see an issue with bringing it up. I understand people will say dont do that, but if they have good intentions and like you, I'd think they would understand why you are asking and explain.   


If it turns out they never wanted to see me again, then I can easily move on. To me its just not a nice thing to do to people. I know its hard to say no, but stringing people along in my opinion creates more anger. At least for me. I can respect a no, but when someone strings me along I feel like ive been done wrong.   


There are definitely times where its difficult to know whether or not another date is a good idea, but if the person seems interested and your really not sure, maybe its just better to not flake on them for a week. Maybe just schedule the next date with them and follow through on it. Then after that you should have more clarity.  


So to me if the reason is because your not sure then you may as well get that next date and make a decision then.   


What are your thoughts on this? I know we are only human and stringing people along isnt always deliberate, but other times it is and the slow burn is soo much worse then just a no over text. I've seen people say that they are afraid of the reaction, but in my mind the reaction would be way worse if they got strong along right? it is for me.

My question is, what makes people think they can tell someone ‚Äúthey can do better‚Äù because the person they‚Äôre seeing, dating, talking to, etc.. doesn‚Äôt fit their standard of attractiveness?

89,s3tbv0,1642169625,Afraid I‚Äôm catfishing people by accident,"So I‚Äôm (F28) quite insecure about my looks but really want to start dating (other females) so I‚Äôm putting myself out there and doing OLD. Of course everyone picks pictures they think look good of themselves and they do look like me but I‚Äôm aware I don‚Äôt look like that all the time, and I‚Äôm sure I look different irl. I have met people likewise that have very clear pictures of themselves but somehow look different irl too. I don‚Äôt have filters on my pictures or edit them but I still feel like people don‚Äôt realise what I look like and will be disappointed when they meet me. I think my brain doesn‚Äôt know how to comprehend someone might be interested in me, although I get a good amount of matches with girls I think are very pretty. I understand I probably need therapy to help me accept myself but that‚Äôs not an option right now.

94,s3u3t6,1642171785,What should I do?,"What should I do?

I keep having conflicted opinions, so thought I‚Äôd ask here!

I (23M) have never been in a relationship before. I have quite bad anxiety so I never considered a relationship until my therapist said it might be a good idea to gain confidence.

I matched with this girl (21F) on a dating app and we really hit it off on text. We went on a date a couple weeks later and she was very chatty and we ended up speaking for 3 hours.

The more I chatted to her, and also on text/voice notes, the more I realised we aren‚Äôt really compatible. It sounds weird but she‚Äôs overly nice, agreeing with everything I say, over apologises to me if she thinks she‚Äôs upset me, it‚Äôs kind of putting me off. She also seems a bit socially immature, she‚Äôs first year at uni and it almost seems like (although she‚Äôs only 2 years younger), like I‚Äôm dating someone in school or something.

All of these reasons contribute to me not seeing a future with her, however I‚Äôm a guy who‚Äôs 23, never been in a relationship and I feel like I‚Äôm ruining a chance with someone who clearly likes me. Part of me wonders if I should try dating her more and see, but part of me has had these feelings of not liking her for a few weeks so I don‚Äôt want to lead her on if I don‚Äôt like her.

I want to get an idea of what holds men back in dating. To do that, I would love it if you answered a few questions for me so I have better idea of what's going on.

Thanks in advance. I really appreciate it.

Anyway, here are the questions...

**What have you done to improve your dating life?**

99,s3uyqp,1642173997,How me and my best friend celebrate valentines day!,"I feel like valentines day is a hard time for us single people and I feel like it's very hard to find friends who are willing to celebrate that day with you. Now my best friend isn't single she's in a relationship with her boyfriend of 4 years and me well I've been chronically single since birth and ( I'm a girl who asks my love interests out ).¬† 

Not only that I went on a date with a someone who fit my moral interests ( waiting till marriage remaining celibate etc ) things like that but after the date they decided that they wanted to be just friends with me and overall my dating life has been bad timing and unfortunately bad luck overall. 

I've never been in a relationship before or kissed anyone before ( been the just a ""friend"" kind of girl to my love interests ). Basically my love life consist of who im attracted to isn't attracted to me and the people who I'm not attracted to is interested in me. 

But anyways besides my sappy love life my best friend is actually one of those people who makes valentines day about everyone her friends family and romantic partner. These are the things me and her do on that day!

1. Sometimes we will text or call each other
Sometimes If both of us aren't home on that day will call each other or text each other throughout the day.

2. We will hang out for an hour or two before she goes over her boyfriends house. ( if we aren't both busy ) 

3.  We exchange gifts!! she's gotten me a gift for valentines day before and soon I'll be able to get her one still trying to figure out what it's going to be

4. I also get gifts for my other friends that are apart of my life its nice to share the love even though you don't have someone personally to give it to for now. 

Anyways I know valentines day is a month away but we can do it!
