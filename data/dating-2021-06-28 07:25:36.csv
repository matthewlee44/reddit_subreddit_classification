0,o9jax1,1624883509,In need of your thoughts and advice concerning future relationships/mental health,"It's been close to 4 months now, healing from a quick 2 months relationship. But man that relationship was special to me. At first we had this unspoken thing that we were having fun but i got attached, and when it ended on her behalf i got hit bad.

I'm far from over it, for i found myself thinking about her or wishing that she was with me in many occasions. The thing is i'm not very good at making myself happy, mainly due to my depression, i'm not at peace with my own mind. I'm trying to work on myself in that regard, pushing aside the thoughts that i'm lonely and that i need someone to make me happy. So far its not working very well and here comes the dilemma.

I'm a fairly attractive guy i get flirted with often, and i got multiple hints from women to go on dates etc in the past few months. The thing is i'm done dating ""just for fun"" or just because i'm lonely or just because i found soneone interesting/beautiful. I want to take this period to self reflect, better myself mentally, be self dependent concerning my happiness. But its hard you know, i'm tired, i want someone, i hate being alone, i have very good friends but a hug, a simple i love you or a kiss, words of encouragement come different from a SO.

I'm really drained though by all these heartbreaking experiences, i don't know if i should continue with my plan to be emotionally self dependent (mainly because i have doubts that its working, i haven't seen progress) until i find what i call my ""wow"" person or if i should go on dates again, meet people, maybe numb that loneliness and pain until that heartbreaking moment comes again, because i'm sure that with the people in my life rn it's not gonna end well. I hate hurting people and i'm not usually the one doing the damage, and i HATE being hurt. I'm very lonely though.

7,o9ju8k,1624885435,Is she (20F) interested and should I (21M) tell her that I'm interested in her?,"Met my friend through a class in school. We studied together quite a few times during the exam season, and had dinner after our study sessions. I found that we had quite a lot in common, and she was quite cute, so I asked if she wanted to hangout after our finals. We had dinner together and shared some desserts after (we went dutch). That was about ~ 2 months ago.

I've since met her almost once every week to run, and we would eat together after. She doesn't mind sharing food and drinks, and have asked to try something that I had already bit into several times. We would often tease each other about the things we talked about, and talk a lot about our family, aspirations and our plans after graduating.

I recently sent her a snap of some exotic food I tried, and she said she ""must try it sometime ;)"". I suggested going to try it again together, and she said yes immediately, but then realized she couldn't after she checked her calendar (like 2 mins later). She also recently sent me a list of jobs out of the blue, saying that she ""didn't know why but she thought of me"", and I could consider applying to those after graduating. Worth noting that she's also interested in similar jobs.

I feel like she might be interested in me, but then again she calls me bro a lot, and she would sometimes not reply to texts for a day or two. I'm usually the one initiating the hang outs, but she always agrees to it enthusiastically. She cancelled our most recent run though, but then apologized for it a few days later. I'm not sure if she's interested or if she thinks of me as just a friend.

9,o9k45b,1624886377,Not sure what I‚Äôm doing,"I don‚Äôt know what I want

Like the title says, I have put myself in a really messed up position. I just got out of a divorce from a wife who had multiple EA‚Äôs and dropped her like a bad habit. That was a month ago. I moved to another part of the country depressed and currently still can‚Äôt focus right. I rekindle with a girl I knew all my life (high school sweetheart) and didn‚Äôt realize how in love she was with me but she‚Äôs in a shitty relationship.

I was on the other end and as much as I want to tell her it was a horrible feeling I didn‚Äôt. I admitted to her that I loved her before I got married and always had a feeling eventually I would end up being with her despite me telling her I divorced and left a bad marriage. The situation gets worse. I started OLD and I know I‚Äôm a good guy and social so getting dates was never a problem. So a few weeks of moving to a new place I met a nice girl and I know I‚Äôm leading her into believing I know I want something but deep down I don‚Äôt.

I like companionship so I told her a small piece of the bigger picture of the marriage but I didn‚Äôt tell her it was so recent and I think she really likes me. Well I also have an eye for a girl at this Resturant I‚Äôve been going to frequently and she knows I‚Äôm interested so there‚Äôs that. This weekend I sent a song to my ex that she knows if I ever felt sad it was about her. I haven‚Äôt spoken to her since I moved which was 3 weeks ago which she responds ‚ÄúI beg you, don‚Äôt make this any harder than what it is‚Äù. I told her I respected her decision and left it as is.

I‚Äôm on a phone so I‚Äôm sorry if the format is all fucked up.

TLDR: I‚Äôm flirting with 3 girls and deeply miss my ex. I know I‚Äôm a huge douche bag and I‚Äôm on the verge of a mental breakdown. I moved with no friends and family and NO ONE knows the truth. I accepted the fact that this will end badly and even possibly losing my high school sweetheart that I‚Äôve known for 15 years.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o9k45b/not_sure_what_im_doing/

It‚Äôs a concept I don‚Äôt understand at all. To me a lot of things run through my mind.

I feel like it‚Äôs kind of rude/abrasive to do it.

Then I think these women are out with some friends trying to have a good time, they probably don‚Äôt want to be approached at all tonight (for me I know that‚Äôs how I am a lot of the time if someone tries to talk to me). 

And lastly why I don‚Äôt understand this is because I hear all these horror stories from girls about ‚Äúcreepy guys‚Äù hitting on them or trying to buy them drinks and how they get annoyed by it.

However recently she has been going through some issues which have meant that she hasn‚Äôt been able to be as present in the conversation as before. 

Because of this, there have been a couple of issues over the past week or so. Firstly, I noticed her ignoring my messages and i mentioned it to her.

However, we had another issue last night, where i said i was being mentally drained by talking to her and getting nothing back. She got annoyed, and at one point said ‚Äòi‚Äôm not so sure this is right now‚Äô, but in her next message she apologised and we agreed to take a break from talking while she focuses on herself. 

However, I am worrying that I am not going to hear from her again. Just before our talk yesterday she removed me from one of her private stories, although i am still in another one.

We had a great relationship for 4 months. I was the happiest I‚Äôve been in a while. This last year has been difficult in my life and when I started seeing her it was a break from the rest of the life. From the global pandemic, from a soul sucking college semester, from family issues. She was my reprieve and it made me forget the bad when I was with her.

Then, a week after my 21st birthday she dumped me out of nowhere. She told me that she wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship. I was hurt but I was okay with it. Our time together was genuine. Then 2 weeks later I saw her posting about her first month with her boyfriend. 

I called her out on it and she said that she was sorry but she was still in love with him and just didn‚Äôt want to hurt me. And that‚Äôs when it crushed me. Our relationship was fake, I was a distraction for her and when the guy she actually wanted came around I was worthless.

But sometimes after you've asked all of those questions you feel like you have nowhere else to go? I think this is when people get bored and stop talking. Is there some other good questions I can ask?

Is that even possible at my age? I‚Äôm ready to give all of myself to someone, someone who truly wants me. My heart is guarded, but often times it has  been protect me from those who want to use it.

I was on a second date with a white man. He was talking about how he doesn't get offended by anything. And him and his friends often make fun of each other. 

He went onto say that his South Asian friend says racist stuff towards white people. And in turn he says racist stuff back. He said: ""And I call him a p*ki"".

I was shocked that he said a racial slur on this date. I felt very awkward and excused myself to the bathroom. I called him up on this and he apologised for saying it. The rest of the date went fine and he's asked to see me again.

I'm not sure if him saying that word should be a red flag or not. That word has been used to bully me and I just don't like hearing it. At the same time, I know that as people we grow and learn. Maybe he just made a mistake?

42,o9n9pr,1624896147,The many layers of calling someone a ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù on reddit,"There are possible things that this behavior.

1) The guy is actually being a classic ‚Äúnice guy.‚Äù Like a girl rejected him and he told her, ‚ÄúYou just don‚Äôt like me because I‚Äôm a nice guy. Fuck you.‚Äù Or something like that. How did we find out about it on reddit? Maybe the guy told reddit all about it? Idk. Would be pretty dumb. The classic way is the girl posts the text or something like that.

2) Toxic masculinity. Unsuccessful guys call other unsuccessful guys ‚Äúnice guys‚Äù no matter what‚Äôs going on. Because they get a thrill out of it. It makes them feel good. Because that‚Äôs the kind of people they are apparently.

3) Well intentioned people use the term ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù to describe, in addition to its original definition, other kinds of more or less toxic behavior that may or may not be related to the classic definition. Pretty soon the whole logic of the idea starts breaking down and you start calling a guy a ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù for simply wanting a girlfriend or something that is fairly universal actually. It becomes victim blaming.

4) I feel like most older couples at some point have had the following exchange around me. The older man laughs and says, ‚ÄúLet me give you some advice about relationships. Don‚Äôt argue with your wife. Just let her be right. Everything is much better that way.‚Äù Then he laughs again and his wife laughs too. Idk but maybe this is just something that‚Äôs gonna be like that sometimes. A woman says, ‚ÄúThis behavior by this guy is equivalent to him telling a girl that he‚Äôs a nice guy and deserves sex because of it.‚Äù You think to yourself, ‚ÄúWell that doesn‚Äôt sound quite right to me.‚Äù Then you stop and advise yourself, ‚ÄúI better just not say anything.‚Äù And then you move on.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o9n9pr/the_many_layers_of_calling_someone_a_nice_guy_on/

I've been always careful not to creep out people especially women. So eventually it grew into a much more state that I can't even put up a conversation with a single person - unless it's a working environment. 

Every single female that I've known had  disgusting horror story done by males. I guess due to my low self esteem I'm so scared to ruin my fragile ego so I can't conversate with anyone. Even casually. If people try to do, I literally start to have heart palpations, start to slur and end up slither away from there with an excuse - sometimes without. 

wtf should I do. I already feel like 3 quarters of my life spent alone, and I've been desperately in need of a relationship. At the same time I don't had much to live. If I try to go to a therapist, that'll probably start working years after and I'll be 100 years old. But I can't approach people because people already have traumas, I don't want to trigger them and I'm too scared what's left of my ego. 

I'm asking here because I'm expecting hear normal advices rather than mtgow and 'go the gym bro' bullshit. 

Also tried dating apps as well, I don't get matches as I'm not a photogenic person. In fact I don't like my picture taken either so I don't have much photos.

I am a 27F - three and a half years ago I went out with my girl friends - we met two guys at a bar and I ended up hitting it off with one of them. I gave him my number even though he said he was about to leave for marine training - as me and my friends left to get into the Uber - he ran outside and we kissed each other.

We ended up going on dates that week and I spent the night one night - it was obvious that we needed to keep things light because he was leaving.

While he was at training - he would call me whenever he got his phone. 

When he would come back home - we saw each other and went out with his friends.

Move forward 3.5 years - I got out of a relationship that lasted 1.5 half. I reached out to him - he recently got back from being deployed.

He just asked me to get together tonight - I‚Äôm scared of getting my heart hurt again because I do have feelings. Should I see him? 

I sense that he likes me but logistically it‚Äôs a bit complicated Bc he‚Äôs in the marines.

48,o9ns8e,1624897551,Is there anything wrong with not wanting to be alone ?," Dating ""experts"", self-help authors, they all spout the same thing over and over again. Money won't you make happy. A relationship won't make you happy. This won't make you happy. That won't make you happy. Now guess what people this is usually coming from : People who have these things.

 Citing famous people who have these things who have still gone mad is not a good argument. Fame is an absurd state of being. Citing yourself or other people you know is a not a great argument either. If money won't solve someone's problem, that doesn't mean it won't solve the other person's problem. Maybe money is exactly what that person needs to aquire the means to better his situations. Maybe a partner is exactly what that person needs.

 I wonder if it's time to abandon this idea of complete emotional autonomy that has been hammered into us by the media.  There's also this idea that a man is not a man if he can't be alone. A woman is not an enlightened woman and she shouldn't ""need a man"". Almost like this weird battle of the sexes. But there shouldn't be a battle. There should be cooperation. I honestly don't think that man or woman are completely complete without oneanother.

I feel we need to tell people that it's perfectly okay to crave intimacy and that doesn't mean that one is running away from their problems. For God's sake, we're humans.

When I said goodbye, I suggested we hang out again sometime and she smiled and said she'd text me. In a later discussion about food, I offered to cook for her sometime and she said ""maybe!"".

It seems like her interest has waned but I'm not sure. I've been out of the dating game for a few years and post-COVID has me a little more socially awkward and picking up on cues is more difficult.

So anyway, I matched with a girl on hinge (we are both mid 20s) and we've been talking on there for a few days and since I enjoyed talking with her I decided to ask her on a date. She said she would like to go on one. I don't go on a lot of dates, but for first dates I normally just like meeting up to grab a coffee or something cause it can be quick and I feel like it's a low pressure way to meet someone for the first time. Well, due to our schedules the only time that works for us both is in the early evening around dinner time. I'm not the biggest fan of dinner dates and I don't feel like going to a brewery and grabbing drinks either. I've done drinks before for dates and they've been enjoyable, it's just with my schedule I would prefer not to this time.

 I was thinking of taking her to go bowling and then go grab some ice cream afterwards. My only problem is that the time is around dinner time so we might both be hungry which is were I am getting confused. I don't want to push bowling back too late cause I have work early in the AM the next day, but if don't push it back I feel like we should at least grab something to eat first. So my question is what order would be best?

She then told me that was a very awful thing to say/do and that she had to walk a long way home because I ditched her. She also said that she hated herself and started self-harming and sending me pictures of it. She also made comments about being tired of trying and being done with life.

67,o9pgca,1624902419,I suddenly started missing him again and being confused about the relationship.,"Me and my bf of 2 and a half years broke up 3 months ago and a few weeks ago I was feeling much better and was looking hopeful for the future and only slightly missing him. But over the past few days I‚Äôve been missing him really badly and am confused again. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because me and my family aren‚Äôt in good terms right now/ my mental health is very bad right now/I don‚Äôt have many plans recently or is it I‚Äôve genuinely started missing him again. 

I‚Äôve been feeling so awful about myself and just feel like a shit person because of my behaviour and toxicity in the relationship and I can‚Äôt help but want to punish myself for that. But the thing with our relationship was that he gaslighted me a lot and I didn‚Äôt realise this until a few weeks after the relationship ended, it kinda hit me like a bus that he wasn‚Äôt all innocent and he also did a lot of stuff wrong too. 

I guess there a few reasons why I‚Äôm still confused: why am I missing him still after all the stuff both of us have done, our relationship was fairly toxic. He was also a very unpredictable person so one time he would be the most amazing supportive boyfriend and bought me flowers everyday and fought my corner then the other minute he wasn‚Äôt taking any responsibility for his actions and kept saying I ‚Äòmisunderstood the situation‚Äô and ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt do that‚Äô and ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sorry you feel that way‚Äô so I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm making the gaslighting up and he was great and I was the only toxic one because how can someone change from the perfect boyfriend (and I‚Äôm not just saying this, at times he was exactly what an amazing bf should be like and planned amazing thoughtful dates and told me he loved me so many times a day for example) to someone who isn‚Äôt very nice, that much of change doesn‚Äôt seem possible. 

Even though all my friends and family say he‚Äôs manipulative and abusive I still don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm in denial and am trying to blame him even though it‚Äôs my fault, I don‚Äôt know if I should trust their judgement. I just want to find out the truth so I can improve as a person and move on from him, i know it will hurt if it‚Äôs all my fault but it‚Äôs better than living blaming someone who only tried to love me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o9pgca/i_suddenly_started_missing_him_again_and_being/

Due to where we live with the pandemic, everything has been closed each date we‚Äôve had so all of our dates so far have been outdoor activities, followed by just watching movies/hanging out at his house/hooking up. Some things however have recently opened up again (outdoor patios). He expressed to me recently that the next date we go on, he wants it to be a real date since all our dates so far have been so casual. He said he wanted to take me to a fancy patio and get food/drinks. However, the weather tomorrow (when our date is planned) is 90% chance of severe thunderstorms all day. I also would have to drive an hour to get to him. I‚Äôve been really busy lately so the idea of having a day off to myself to stay in my pjs all day alone is tempting since I can‚Äôt really do much of anything anyways

I messaged him saying I‚Äôm still free tomorrow but if he wants to reschedule I would be completely fine with that so we can have a real date finally. But now I‚Äôm thinking I should just cancel to save myself from driving an hour to have a date that will completely consist of us just being in his apartment.

69,o9ppvw,1624903230,Me 31M wants to end things with a date 36F because I became exclusive with someone else,"Hello folks! So I was dating two girls I met online (for convenience sake lets call them Becky and Jess) and one of them whom I quite liked (Becky) recently asked me to become exclusive which makes me very happy. That said, I now have the unpleasant job of breaking up with the other girl (Jess) I was dating.

Jess was also a great person, we met up around 3-4 times and even had sex once although it was kind of disappointing because it was done after copious amounts of drinking since we had gone to a bar before and were having fun. That said, there was definitely a big cultural and moderate language barrier between us. Actually the last date we had was just yesterday to address this issue. This was the issue which also made sex kind of disappointing since we had a tough time communicating. 

Anyways, when we met up yesterday I told her I was dating other people too when she asked me and she said she wasn't dating anyone else. We had some good food, watched a movie, made out a little, and then she went home since it was a Sunday and we both had to be up early for Monday calls. Now Monday night Becky calls me and we chat for 4 hours and she asks if I want to be exclusive. I agree. I told her about Jess and she says she is fine for me to break up with her first before we see each other again.

So I need to break up with her before Friday but I don't want to give some lame excuse nor make her feel like I was using her as a backup or something. I've not been in this situation before. What is the best way for me to end things with her? What should I actually say?

TL;DR - Became exclusive with the girl I liked, how shall I breakup with the other girl I was seeing without being dishonest but also not making her feel like a backup.

It shouldn‚Äôt be that way, but what can we do?

I‚Äôm making this post because my close friend put herself in a position where I literally needed to drive a day and a half to get her. An affluent guy she met online and had been talking to for a few weeks who bought her expensive gifts and the guy offered to fly her to San Francisco for a vacay. 

She went and when she got there he expected some coochie. She wasn‚Äôt comfortable with that so he kicked her out and canceled her ticket back. Lucky for her, I have kin in Oakland. I called my mom up and begged her to to let my friend stay with with her. Also lucky for her I had saved up some leave so I could take a trip with some my buddies to Disney Land. 

I wasted 3 of my days so I could go to Oakland to see my family and pick her dumb ass up and bring her back home. I was so confused how a grown ass 25 year old woman could be so naive and put herself in such a dangerous postion. 

I told her this and I will give all women here the following information.

Do not get flown out by a man you barely know and except to not give him something back in return. It‚Äôs not right that a lot of men see a woman‚Äôs body as currency or a reward for a gift, but a lot of men do and you need to be aware of how dangerous that could be to you.

87,o9rh8l,1624908451,Am I overthinking? Or do I let it go?," I (M30) separated from a long-time friend last year, and have slowly gotten back to dating. Two weeks ago I met this women (F32) on the usual dating apps, and we quickly met up for a picnic in a nearby park. The date went really well, the conversations were great and we had quite the fun. At the end, we briefly kissed, and agreed to meet up for a second date.

Afterwards we texted around five or six times to schedule the second date a week later, with her very actively going for the second date. This time, it was a very hot summer day, we decided to get a drink at a bar with A/C. Unfortunately there were no free seats left, so we had to sit outside, in the shade, but it was still quite hot.

Because of the heat I was a little distracted, and while we had a more serious conversation (work, future, goals, kids), the vibe wasn't just as easy-going as it was the first time. When we left the bar after three hours we walked home to her place, arm in arm, joking and kissing.

Since we both had to work the next day it was clear that we wouldn't spent the night, and stopped near her apartment. We shared a few kisses and I mentioned that I had to tell her something (I am a little allergic to cats, and she sometimes cares for one). Almost instantly she replied that she also had to tell me something. We joked around, but neither revealed their secret. She just let it slip that her secret would be something that I had to decide if I am OK with.

So we decided to tell each other on the next date. She told me to let her know once I made it home safely, and we saw each other off. When I got home, I showered and sent her a quick text that I am home and thanked her for the interesting and fun evening, despite the heat.

She replied the next day, likewise thanking me, and also making a remark about the heat. I replied that evening saying that the heat really was uncomfortable at times, and that I would like to see her again under better climatic conditions. I did not think much of it because I was expecting her to answer something like ""yeah, that would be nice"" and from then on schedule the next date.

However, she has not replied to this message for three days now, which is the longest span of non-communication we have had so far. I know she is with friends at her hometown this weekend, so she might be busy.

The simple question I have is: What do I do now? Sent another text telling her my available days for the next date? Call her? Just let it go?

She has always been very involved, has been fascinated with the picnic, blowing me kisses and grabbing my arm and hands while kissing on the way home from the second date. We had a funny situation where we collided with our faces while trying to give each other a kiss, and she quickly apologized saying that she was a little out of practice. So altogether I had the impression that she is interested and attracted.

Also, for what it is worth, on the first date we talked a lot about how important direct communication was, and that we both prefer to be direct when it comes to dating and avoid ghosting people, because we both had been on the receiving end of it already.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o9rh8l/am_i_overthinking_or_do_i_let_it_go/

My problem is, I never am I girls first choice.

First I never really have a lot of options. I‚Äôll see a girl for a month or two and then if that doesn‚Äôt work out I can‚Äôt get a first date for another few months. All the girls I‚Äôm seeing are always seeing multiple guys, which I‚Äôve just accepted that that‚Äôs how dating is but it‚Äôs still a lot of pressure knowing she has options and I‚Äôm expendable to her while she  will likely be the only girl I talk to until the next season.

Of the women I‚Äôve talked to none of them have wanted to be serious with me while they‚Äôre seeing other men. But all of them want to keep taking to me if the guy they‚Äôre they decide to be serious with isn‚Äôt working out.

Like so many times have I gotten a text that we shouldn‚Äôt see each other, or I get ghosted then on social media they‚Äôre always with some other guy, then when that flops, she hits my line asking for me to hang out. It‚Äôs really demoralizing. I‚Äôm always the back up. Always the guy that‚Äôs there if the guy that she doesn‚Äôt actually want doesn‚Äôt work out. 

Then I have to contemplate whether it‚Äôs worth it to start dating her again knowing I‚Äôm only talking to her because they guy she wanted didn‚Äôt want her. I like to tell myself that I have more dignity than that, but if I‚Äôm being honest I don‚Äôt think I do. I usually end up seeing them for a once or twice more and letting it fizzle.

I just want someone to view me as a prize, like they actually want me or view me as more than the understudy. It makes me not want to date every time it happens but I know I‚Äôm a hopeless romantic and want to find love.

94,o9sfb2,1624911293,What's your advice after a FT convo!,"Hi all, just looking for some advice and thoughts!

I (35, male) live in Seattle and matched with a woman (34, female) who lives in Washington DC. We matched and chatted on the apps for a week or so before exchanging numbers and moving over to text. After a couple of days, we finally FaceTimed over this past weekend. 

I think it went well. It lasted a little over 3 hours or so. The tone of the conversation was more casual and getting to know one another, like what we do, favorite types of foods, what we do in our spare time, past travels, and any future plans. So, nothing really flirty or anything, but I think overall a nice conversation. In the end, she had to hang up because it was getting pretty late there, almost midnight. We ended the convo saying she'll text me and we can facetime again etc.

So few things:

- aware of the distance, however, in general, I'm not tied down to settling in Seattle since the majority of my family is more between the midwest and east coast. 
- I'm not putting all my eggs in one basket, I've matched with other women as well, even ones that are local, but I for some reason enjoyed my FT conversation than I have some first/second dates.


A couple of questions:

- No one really sitting on an FT for 3 hours if there isn't at least a hint of interest right?

- I'm at the age where I'm kind of over all these texting games, should I just text her or wait? Is it any different with FT and actually meeting in person?

- Due to a couple of upcoming weddings, a trip, and some family obligations, I can't really make it out there until the first or second week of August... If we continue to chat over the next couple of weeks, when should I bring up the possibility of one of us flying out to meet one another if we both comfortable with it, etc? The last thing I want to do is waste each other's time!

I‚Äôve had matches and such but I have always eventually gotten ghosted. I‚Äôve deleted and remade my account several times and after a particularly long absence I decided to get back on. 

The first girl I matched had a bio that says, ‚ÄúI only drink beer.‚Äù I decided to try to play off of her ‚Äòcharming‚Äô bio and say that the only beer I like is Bud Lite. She then replied saying, ‚ÄúDid I ask?‚Äù I was pretty taken aback since I had never matched with someone this mean. I told her that she seemed like a very nice person and unmatched. Now, I have this looming bad feeling as I use this app. Any advice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o9t79w/first_match_on_tinder_after_months_has_me_feeling/
98,o9t7l5,1624913661,Hello am new here,"So basically I‚Äôve know a girl for a while and then we started talking everyday, I really loved that and with time I became more addicted to her , when I realized that I thought about asking her out and we did go outa couple of times , but then i said hey maybe you should just date her and be in a relationship with her , so I decided to do it she refused that cuz she had her reason , i took me a while to recover from the rejection and after a couple of month i got into a relationship with another girl it was really good but then I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from thinking about the first girl , and everything got worse and worse , and i just decided to break up cuz I don‚Äôt wanna be unfair to her cuz am thinking about someone else (ik that its my bad and am really guilty) , after the break up I couldn‚Äôt even bring myself to talk to the first girl till now , and im beginning to feel more lonely every single day, i just don‚Äôt know what to do
