3,o4tk0x,1624277151,"Date outside your type, people!","Seriously, this is the best piece of advice that I have been applying and I'm having success for the first time in years. I think we confuse that someone looking a certain way or having certain interests makes them good partners for us, but it's the shared values and shared energy that makes for a great dating experience. Liking someone as a person because they're interesting is not the same as having a great dating experience with them. Have all the interesting friends you want, but date the person who makes you feel at peace in your heart. Date the person who treats you well and is consistent. I'm currently in shock because how much I like this person's energy that I'm seeing, completely overrides that I initially didn't find them physically attractive.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4tk0x/date_outside_your_type_people/
4,o4tovz,1624277612,"told a guy to take things slowly, now he doesn't want to meet in real life. What do I do?","tldr: met this guy online, hit off really well. Told him to take things slowly and now he has drifted apart from me and doesn't want to meet in real life. 

Okay, to cut the guy some slack, I was the confusing one here. 

To give context: we met online, hit off really well, and chatted nonstop for a month, heck we even gamed together and called each other. After a while, based on my past exp of guys rushing into the relationship too fast and losing interest way too fast, I told him I felt uncomfortable that he called me names like ""babe"", constantly updated me about almost anything like what he had for lunch. I felt that way cos maybe he didnt actually like me for me, that he is just liking the ideal he has of me or that maybe he's just really desperate and lonely (he told me he doesnt have alot of close friends). Furthermore, he told me alot about himself, like his family's situation, why he and his ex broke up (we were talking about our types, he said about his ex to explain he felt communication was vital) and I felt very taken aback since we only met for like one month, and online. 

After I told him about how I felt in a long text, to just take things slowly and be friends first, he apologised profusely and said he understood how I felt. He then justified that he did all that to lighten the mood and start the conversation most of the time. Ngl, I felt bad then but I was still skeptical cos I've gotten gaslit by a  desperate guy before lol. Anyways, a few days later, he tried to make conversation again and I didn't reply as I was busy with work. I saw that he deleted it and then replied to him once my work was done, and he said he did it as he felt he was being ghosted. We tried to talk, he asked again if we were just friends (to which I said yes) but the convo got awkward and we ended it on a good note. 

Today, I asked him if we were meeting this week as agreed (before I told him how I felt in the long text) and he said ""no, lets just be friends"". I told him ""yeah lets meet as friends"" and he said no but he still suggested we could play games together next time. I thanked him for the time spent together and so did he. But here's the thing, after reflecting about it, i realised i  have screwed up. I didn't tell him clearly that i still saw him as potential partner, that when I meant friends first I meant like to get to know him well first before we actually date.

Now, Im worried that he has lost interest in me, found me annoying and has decided on his end to REALLY just be friends. I wouldnt like that cos I actually like hanging out with him but Im too prideful and I dont know how to apologise cos Im still skeptical. Ive texted him to call later but he hasnt replied yet. 

Does he still have interest in me? Does he really just want to be friends? How can I rectify this mistake? Was I being too skeptical? Please help, Im nervous as heck and he hasnt replied me yet.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4tovz/told_a_guy_to_take_things_slowly_now_he_doesnt/
5,o4tu19,1624278089,What would you do in my situation? I’m looking for something more serious but girl I’m seeing wants to keep seeing me casually,"I’m a 22M who has been seeing this girl 22F for the last 6/7 weeks and we’ve been getting on well - we both seem really comfortable around each other, similar senses of humour, really sexually compatible etc.

I’ve been on dates with multiple people within the past few months, and with each of them have been up front that I’m looking for something more serious like a relationship, but none of that has gone anywhere. The girl I’ve been seeing most recently is the only one I hadn’t mentioned wanting something more serious to, so when I recently brought up to her about what we were, where we wanted to go with things, she said she doesn’t want to put a label on things but still wants to see me while considering herself single. 

To put it into context as well, we are both leaving the city we’re living in, in the next 2 months, so it does kind of make sense in that regards that something wouldn’t be able to work out.

I’m not sure what to do now, as part of me wants to keep seeing her on a more casual basis as I do like spending time with her, and the 2 months I have left living here isn’t really enough time I don’t think to find someone new to develop something serious with anyway.

8,o4ueqy,1624279948,Can ex’s really make it work after so much time?,"So, my ex broke up with me almost 8 months ago. Decided within three weeks after the breakup that he regretted it and wanted me back. 
After months of staying strong, little communication (on my end), I finally decided to meet up with him. I don’t want to down play it, it was the worst break up of my life so far, I’ve had 3 (28f)
It’s weird, even though he broke up with me, I felt like I owed it to him. 
The day was great to be honest, I mean we spent the whole day together. He has really matured, he spoke to me in such an honest manner and it was clear that he had really reflected on everything that went wrong with us. 
It was a day of pretend though, we laughed, we cried, we fell back into old habits. We cuddled, we kissed (but not on the lips) even though I’m sure we both wanted to but I’m still far too cautious. He asked if I still loved him and I said yeah. I have thought about this boy every single day since we broke up, it hasn’t been easy. Now, I’m in a situation where there’s absolutely no way we can get back together, If that wasn’t the case, I think it would be on the cards or I think I would be feeling more head fucked about things. 
However, my question is… after quite some time apart, I’m talking a year / two years. Do you think ex’s can get back together or am I being completely naïve? 
Don’t get me wrong, I won’t be holding out for this person but I have this weird feeling that he really is he person for me, he just needs to mature into a man.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4ueqy/can_exs_really_make_it_work_after_so_much_time/

11,o4v7of,1624282290,"Red flag, or am I overthinking ?","Met a guy on Tinder. We know some of the same people - about a year ago an old co worker actually saw him for abit. I remember she was pretty into him but she was also seeing a lot of guys and just having fun, so it didn’t surprise me that it didn’t last long. I never asked what happened.

Fast forward to last week, we matched and he messaged me. Conversation gets going, I realize I recognize him from the one time he came into work to see my co worker, and we talk about her briefly then continue onto other conversation. He ends up asking me out for that night. We exchange numbers and later on go out for dinner. The attraction is instant and chemistry and conversation is great. The restaurant we chose closes fairly early and it also got chilly super fast(outdoor dining only due to Covid here). He invited me to come back to his place and watch a movie so we could continue to spend time together. He said he wouldn’t be offended if I wasn’t comfortable and didn’t want to. (I’m not naive enough to think that sleeping with me didn’t cross his mind, but he did seem very politely and genuine.) I decided to go for it. We spent a whole movie talking more, even discussing our work schedules and when we’d be able to see eachother again. We started a second movie and got all cuddled up. The first kiss was amazing and things got heated pretty fast. He asked multiple times if everything he was doing was okay (consent is sexy and important !). After some fooling around he said I could stay over, no pressure for anything further to happen but it was late and he needed to head to bed. I was feeling super comfortable and decided to stay. We did end up hooking up and it was really good. 

We’ve now spent 4 out of the last 5 nights together and the only night I wasn’t with him, we spent most of the day together before I went home and he took me for breakfast the next morning and we spent the whole day together again.

My dilemma now is that obviously things are moving pretty quickly but I can’t tell if he has a genuine interest in it potentially becoming a relationship or if it’s just a long for him. We’ve talked briefly about some past relationships, including how things ended between him and my co worker, and I’m getting a bit uneasy. It sounds like it’s pretty typical for him to move this fast with all the girls he sees, spend pretty much every day together and then when something happens he doesn’t like, just cuts them off. (He ended things with my co worker for a completely understandable reason to be fair.)

He’s also already made a comment (while drunk) about deleting his Tinder because he hasn’t been on since we met. Not that I was going to hold him to it, but I can see that he definitely has been online on the App as his location distance has changed.

Basically I don’t know if I should continue to pursue things with him because I’m having trouble reading him and where things are headed, and I genuinely like him and don’t want to end up getting too deep of  feelings if it’s just a fling and he’s waiting for the next girl to come along.

Advice welcome, but also just super frustrated and needed a spot to vent.

12,o4vjy8,1624283361,Why are women obsessed with confidence?,"Every piece of dating advice given to men and women always mention confidence as the most important and most attractive trait in a man. Its even used as an explanation as to why terrible guys still find partners, because young women mistake arrogance for confidence. So confidence must be pretty important to ignore all the terrible things they do.

I get confidence is nice and all but its hardly the trait I look for most in a person. Just looking at my friend group, one of my friends gets shy and insecure sometimes but he's one of the most interesting, intelligent and funniest guy I know. Whereas my most confident friend (who also is the most romantically successful, so confidence really is king) is the least interesting. I mean I love the guy but he only really talks about alcohol and cars. If I was dating a girl, I'd much rather date someone really interesting but a little shy than someone boring but confident. 

An argument I've heard is that men who are unconfident probably have deep insecurities leading to toxic behaviours so its a red flag. Ok, that makes sense but it only explains why a lack of confidence is unattractive but not why confidence is attractive.

So why is confidence so important. This doesn't bother me by the way. Confidence is probably an easier trait to gain than becoming interesting, smart, funny, kind and so on.

17,o4wg46,1624285932,"Guy(26M) I've(23F) been dating for 3ish months has issues having conversations. For other nervous/introverted men, how long does it take you to open up to a woman?","We've been dating for about 3 maybe 4 months. We started having sex after the third date (he initiated the touching, but I asked him if he wanted to go all the way) and he asked me to be his girlfriend about 2 months in. His personality is introverted and he's a bit on the nervous side. I'm pretty sure he had no experience prior to me and he wasn't able to work up the courage to ask me to be his girlfriend until after we'd been drinking at a bar for a bit 2 months in. I'm pretty similar to him personality-wise and I also have issues opening up and having good conversations with people that I don't know that well. I find that lately though, I've found myself to be at the point where I'm comfortable enough to just talk to him casually and relax around him. It's a great feeling and the conversations between us are definitely flowing better because of it. 

My issue is that I feel like he still hasn't really gotten comfortable with me yet. It's not an issue of him not liking me enough. I definitely get that feeling that he's just completely fallen for me because he shows all the classic signs in the way he stares, hugs, texts, or just treats me in general. He's even tried to get me to meet his parents several times, he's asked me to go on family vacations with him, and he's mentioned possibly moving in together in a year (I haven't actually met his parents or gone on vacation with him though because I've had conflicts each time. I gave him a maybe on the moving in together since I personally feel like it was way too soon to seriously consider that). He's a big worrier and always asks me if something he did was ok with me and is always trying to make sure I didn't misinterpret or misunderstand things he says or texts he sends. 

Again, this is all cool with me as I really like him and I feel like our personalities just mesh really well. I feel like I've discovered a long lost friend in him that I also happen to find attractive. I just feel like he's having an entire conversation with me in his head instead of out loud. Like lately, I've been talking more openly with him about things and feeling more comfortable with him. Sometimes, there'll still be that pause in the conversation. I'm fine with these conversation pauses, but I notice that he'll just sit there and he looks like he's thinking about things. He'll open his mouth like he's about to talk and then he'll end up not saying anything at all. Whenever I notice he does this, I ask him what he was about to say. He'll usually get embarassed and say it was nothing. He actually gave me an answer to what he was about to say a couple of times. Once, it was something about how he was thinking about me giving him a blowjob right there (we were in public and we both laughed it off). The other time, it was about me moving in with him next year (which I said maybe to bc we had only been dating for like 2 months at that point). He doesn't usually initiate conversations that often though, and when he does it's usually small talk and he's asking me random questions about myself. He never tells me much about what he likes or what he's been up to lately. So, at dinner, the conversation usually ends up with me talking almost the whole time about how my week went or things that interest me or something that happened one time a couple years ago. I'll keep trying to steer the conversation back to him and let him talk, but he gives me those short answers that I recognize from myself that are signs of being nervous and uncomfortable. It's just frustrating to see that he's not fully comfortable with me yet. So, guys who are also nervous introverts, how long does it typically take for you to feel comfortable and open up with a woman you're dating?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4wg46/guy26m_ive23f_been_dating_for_3ish_months_has/

25,o4y9r4,1624290702,I (f27) have been seeing a wonderful guy (m30) but I’m having doubts over his social media.,"I have been seeing a guy for 4/5 months. We are exclusive but we haven’t got labels yet. I’ve met his family, friends, and we’ve also made travel plans for the future. We have only had one ‘argument’ which was resolved maturely, and I’m genuinely really happy with him. 

My issue is this; he actively looks at hot women on his Instagram. His reels are full of half-naked TikTok style videos, his discovery page is full of hot women, and he follows professional models, celebs, and others. I also saw that when he searched something he had random beautiful non-famous women in his recent searches. Could be exes or others he may fancy.

It bothers me and I don’t know why as he hasn’t followed any new pages since seeing me and doesn’t comment/like their pics or messages them. I trust him and he opens the app and his messages around me (doesn’t act secretive). He also gave me his phone passcode for when he asks me to check something while he’s driving. 

So I think it’s a case of him browsing. I understand it’s normal to find others attractive, and if it were a few seconds glance at a woman who walks past then I wouldn’t care. That would be coincidental but this seems like he’s seeking it out. I don’t think he’s wrong for it but it’s not my thing. I don’t spend time salivating over hot men on socials so I just don’t understand it.

I’m thinking whether to wait for when we’re official to bring it up? As I just don’t know if I can accept it. I feel like social media is bad for relationships and I don’t know how anyone could be happy with someone when there’s so much beauty and variety out there. Maybe that’s why he doesn’t want labels - in case he finds a better woman.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4y9r4/i_f27_have_been_seeing_a_wonderful_guy_m30_but_im/
26,o4yava,1624290777,Cut off or not?,"So I (20m) met this girl (22F) on Hinge a couple months ago and I wasn't initially attracted to her because i generally like to get to know someone before I let romantic feelings develop. And she wasn't physically my type either, but we hung out and I enjoyed her company and the conversations we had and didn't expect or care for it to be more than that. Until we had dinner around a month ago and after a few drinks I realized I was interested in romance. 

She wanted to stay friends and stated the reason being she was seeing someone at work and it was going well. This bruised my ego a bit, but I don't mind being friends because it was fun and I had fun hanging out with her and I assume she did too because we ended up spending the entire day together every time we hung out which was about 4 times.

I've also kinda been messing around with other people during the whole so being rejected doesn't really affect me as a whole, but If someone says they want to be friends I kind of expect them to act like a friend? like she's just bad at replying to texts has difficulty sticking to plans, doesn't really seem interested in me as a person at all unless we meet up and hang out, so it's just very confusing as a whole what she wants exactly and i've been leaving her alone to see what she does, but then she comes with a text asking me how I am doing and it feels like she's forcing herself to care when she probably doesn't?

It's very weird because she's probably taken more pictures of me out of everyone I know since the beginning of the year, has expressed interest in doing more fun things together in the future, but puts little to no effort into it? Do I just let her know i'm fine with not speaking at all and maybe just hanging out every couple of months? I'm not a difficult person at all but it's very annoying when someone just doesn't communicate. So what do I do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o4yava/cut_off_or_not/

I’d like to consider myself slightly average (maybe just a little bit under), clean dressed, white teeth, smell good ALWAYS. Although physical appearance isn’t the only thing that’s important I do consider it to make myself approachable and at least enjoyable to gaze at. Since graduating high school (5years ago)  I’ve attempted about 7-9 girls I would say and nothing came out of them. 

I guess this post is just to vent that I’m losing motivation and to be quite honest my testosterone levels have dropped. It’s extremely hard for me to get ""in the mood"" and if I do it’s only for a few minutes.

30,o4za2h,1624293322,We did it! We worked through our fears and are trying again,"I'm over the moon right now, me and my now boyfriend HAD initially been dating a year and with the pandemic a lot happened with our insecurities and feeling stuck, which led us to splitting up. We continued to stay in touch and slowly talked through all the things that happened. We discussed boundaries, values, fears, expectations etc. It was a long process and sometimes it was really hard, but we made it work and decided we created a solid foundation for a relationship that works for both of us. There were times I questioned and doubted myself, but I made learning about myself and growing as a person a priority and projected that.

I really just wanted to say that sometimes people are worth the effort. Sometimes we just get overwhelmed/lost and don't know how to cope. If you feel like that person is genuine and see effort on their side to better themselves, be patient with them. There will always be ups and downs and it gets REALLY hard, set boundaries, find your values, work on yourself, respect and trust someone the way you would like to be trusted and respected. It's okay to let yourself be vulnerable, just keep checking in with yourself and be mindful of what you are doing.

31,o4zcl7,1624293502,I have trouble gaining interest but none at all when it comes to hurt. ( M 27 )," 

I'm going to warn that I'll likely seem upset with this Post, and I kind of am, but you'll likely see why soon enough.

\----

Simply, I've never really had trouble being hurt by people but I do have massive issues with being liked by them, especially women. I'll wonder about the why's myself but that's not what my Post is about.

it's about my last three ""experiences"" with people who ""supposedly"" liked/had interest in me. (Mostly). &amp; It's about how I could not be hurt by everyone, evidently I don't know how to do that.

\---

so to start this off I'll speak of some girl who, like the other's, supposedly had interest but then said interest abruptly and reasonlessly dies. This lady was quite gorgeous but never did she say much. I guess that should have been a signal of disinterest, but she also claimed that she has issues following what people say. So I guess I can't say for certain. For days we spoke, and she proclaimed her interest in me, which I found nice.

What wasn't so nice was how the day before my birthday she abruptly starts talking to me, sends me some pictures, and before I can even respond and as I get ready to look nice for a picture for her she says that she doesn't like the vibe between us and that we have nothing in common. (I'm wondering how a person can decide that when they offer none of their interests or likes, personally, but oh well)

So be that I guess.

\----

This second one is a bit more fun; for you all maybe. A bit after that first woman I start talking to another, and this person was quite a bit more forward than. Advances were made by her, and I reciprocated.

Plans were made to actually get together, and we traded intimate photos in addition to words and a few others things. We spoke and interacted so much, I don't think I've spent as much time on anyone within a day.

However, as with the last, a day came and all came to ruin again. Turns out she was still in love with another and didn't actually like me at all.

In fact, she said everything was only because she was bored.

...So be that too I guess...

\----

This final one's honestly just bullshit, I'm sorry for being vulgar but damn, this one's today-fresh so the pain is rather strong still, and I don't like the three stings of it either. (You'll see the stings I speak of soon)

So a bit after that second girl I start speaking to another, not for long I'll admit, but it's about the closest I've been to a proper relationship. Last night we made plans to hang out for a portion of today. whihc honestly gave me sincere happiness, I've been in a city for quite a few years and haven't been able to make any friends or anything. So I guess it gave me some hope, you know?

However, here comes the first of those stings I was talking about; I wasn't the only person she invited over that day. She actually had another person over at her place for the morning. which I can't say made me feel the greatest.

How ever, supposedly this guy was so creepy that it made her not want to meet me today. This was the second sting, and it was understandable I'll give it that, I don't hold the ""not wanting to meet"" against her, the reason is sound. (I will say thought that I'm not appreciative of another's actions ruining plans of mine)

So Instead of meeting we just text for a good portion of the day.

But then comes the third and final sting, she spoke about still being interest in some person in a different town and that she wants to date them, not I.

...

...

***Sigh***

So be this too....

Clearly women only like hurting me instead of liking me, how can I make that change?

35,o5003v,1624295185,Is it possible to realize we're in love years later?,"Throwaway account for reasons.

I (33M) have been friends with this girl (28F) for about 5 years. We met through common friends and got into a casual sex relationship for a few months. On my end, I really liked her as a friend, we were having a lot of fun and all, but she confessed she had feelings so we stopped seeing each other for a little while.

She however wanted to remain friends and I had no objection to that so we started hanging out again with no sex involved. She was going through a difficult time financially so I offered my help, we hung out on a regular basis and texted everyday.

Her feelings were always kind of coming and going, and I didn't know how to tell her I wanted to date, so I didn't for a few years. I'm a loner so it was fine by me in a way, dating makes me uncomfortable overall, and I knew it would complicate things and didn't want to lose her as a friend.

Since things were slowly coming back to normal in my country pandemic wise, I expressed my desire to see what's out there, and as expected, our relationship clashed. She couldn't bare the idea of me dating other people so she backed off and we didn't talk or see each other for a few months.

I've had a few dates since but things never felt right, as if something was missing. I kept wondering how she is doing, what's new with her. I held myself back from texting her so many times because I knew she needed her space, but over time, it made me more and more sad that I couldn't reach out to her. We had so many shared memories and all, and I figured I miss her as a friend, but now it kind of aches and I'm very confused about it.

So dear reddit, my question is this : is it possible that I was in love with her this whole time without realizing it?

Its like, its hard enough to meet someone, hit it off, have an honest conversation about expectations and what we're both looking for and somehow make it all the way to hooking up. And when we do its all good vibes, but it always feels like something unspoken develops after we've left each other and they had time to ""process""...

Like, couple days ago i hook up with this girl. We were clear about it being just a friends with benefits thing even before i showed up and i can say for sure the sex was way better for her than it was for me, she came 3 times and i didn't even get a chance to. She even said it was some of the most fun and interesting sex she's ever had, we were laughing a lot

Like i get this a lot, where everything seems great when I'm there and she even took me to this party afterwards so it's not like i just up and left her. I know she had a thing about clingy guys wanting to crash at her place so i left without a fuss and didn't text her much.

But its like, our communication was fine, great even, up until the point when we hooked up and then she goes dark and it could take more than 24-48 hours to respond to a single one of my texts.

55,o53gph,1624304176,haven’t scored a date in 18 years. is it the appearance or the personality?,"i (18, m) have just graduated from highschool and already call myself a freshman in college. i’ve never quite considered myself particularly handsome, although i kept being called that by my relatives and older people, you know what it’s like. i’ve actually always been insecure about my looks because there’s nothing especially wrong or right about me: i’m not exactly tall (i’m 5’10”), i weigh 115 pounds, have always struggled with my hair (i’m naturally very light blonde and have long, very big—80s rockstar king of big, curly hair) and light blue eyes. once put into words, you might actually think i’m attractive, but in reality, i’ve always thought i looked too feminine. i don’t have any muscle, i have a small nose, a small face, big eyes, big lips and my body type doesn’t help either: small shoulders, wide hips, skinny legs. boys would always call me gay, effeminate, wannabe trans girl, just because i wasn’t your typical captain america jock. and these rumors always kept the girls away too — once i got approached by a very pretty upperclassman and thought she’d ask me out but it turned out she was running some stupid poll on the LGBT community and wanted the insight of an “insider”, and once i told her i was straight she told me that i shouldn’t worry about the prejudice because she’s not homophobic. i mean, i don’t know what girls consider attractive to be honest. i’ve never managed to score a date and i’ve never been asked out. im the valedictorian of my year (i don’t know if that’s a thing in all countries), and people know me from debates, conferences, contests, etc, so i might also be labeled as a nerd, even though people see me skip class all the time too. i have great grades and i’m well liked by my teachers. i don’t smoke, i don’t vape, i’ve never done drugs or drunk, i don’t go to parties, i’m passionate about cinematography, literature and philosophy, and dress like an average thrift grandpa. it’s so confusing how this type of person is idolized on social media and avoided like the plague in real life. i’ve been considering dyeing my hair black to be more masculine, and dress like a sweaty road man so i don’t seem gay, but i don’t want to change just so i don’t “give off the wrong idea”, because nobody’s worth changing yourself. is it my appearance that’s the problem? i shower daily, have clear skin, make sure i smell nice all the time, wash my clothes regularly, never wear the same outfit in the same week, love accessorizing, etc. i think i’ve got a pretty good sense of fashion and i seem super approachable. i’m friendly with everyone and always try to give off wholesome and reassuring vibes no matter who i interact with, although i do keep my distance around people i don’t feel comfortable around, and respect everyone’s boundaries. to be honest, i think i’m very decent, but i’ve just never been lucky enough to attract any girls. am i short? do i look gay? am i unappealing because of my style? i need answers",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o53gph/havent_scored_a_date_in_18_years_is_it_the/

The thing is, I have commun friends with both guys, and know both guys a little bit from years ago (haha, second guy was actually my first kiss 10 years ago and we reconnected through OLD), so they are not complete strangers.
My goal is to find a serious relationship, but I want it with the best match possible of course.

It is ethical to multidate ? Should I tell them as they could possibly learn it from friends if I dont tell them, as I already know that both guys told my mutual friends (they are not the same friend)?! When is it best to make a choice? Would sex be off limit (I know sex could happen during next date with the first guy)?

Last time I dated someone I liked, I didn't multidate (I actually refused a date with someone that had potential) and it didnt end well as the guy I was dating told me after 1 month that he was polyamorous.

And now, I finally met a guy who I can be thankful for everyday. I can feel more confident and worthy.

He is my first boyfriend. What made me sure to be commited with him is that, he can accept my mental issues, would reassure and comfort me when I have a breakdown. He is just very good for my mental health. He fulfilled my love language - words of affirmation.

Though our relationship was just a few months old, but I feel like I've known him for a long time. I can see myself in him. We have the same struggles, pains and traumas. And also, we've went to trips together.

He is very caring and funny. I'm glad I could be myself around him. Introducing me to his friends is a huge turn on for me haha. It makes me feel special. I trust him enough to even gave him my first kiss ever.

I guess, that last heartbreak was just a beginning of my happiness.

69,o54l07,1624307059,My (21m) Gf (21F) told me that she doesn't have sympathy for my issues," 

Me and my girlfriend have been dating officially for the past 2.5 months and have been knowing each other unofficially for the past almost 6 months.

Our relationship was going amazing up until around 2 weeks ago, she lied to me about some things, one being the identity of an ex, and another being a rather strange lie (see other posts on my account). This created some tension in our relationship but now it just feels like its gone down the can.

Last night we were talking, and she brought up how I was upset the other day. I was upset because I moved to a brand new city and knew nobody, I have always struggled to make friends my entire life due to bullying and such. But I took a lot of socially energy to make plans with people that day, who ended up bailing last minute. I was frustrated, and sad but I didn't take it out on anyone, I was just in an off mood that night. I told my GF about it at the time and I didn't really feel supported or like she cared, but I shrugged it off.

Anyways she brought it up last night and said that she doesn't like how I throw a pity party or that I whine about problems. And then proceeded to say that she doesn't have any sympathy for a lot of issues I have in my life. This hurt me quite a bit to hear because in the first month of our relationship she didn't act like this towards me, she was very supportive of any issue I faced in my life (not that I face a lot) I'm just confused why she is no longer acting like that and is now cold to my issues. Her tone gives me the opinion that she doesn't care and that ""her issues are more important and difficult than mine"". Which I don't think is fair, I believe that in a relationship, both peoples hardships are valid no matter what they are, and you support each other accordingly.

On the contrary she ""whines"" or ""throws a pity party"" over things all the time and I don't react like that, I either offer to help or just sit there and let her vent to me. One of these things she brings up a lot is about cleaning her house because she has a 2 year old who likes making messes.

I felt like what she said was downright mean, when she is upset she often gets aggressive with her words and says things like ""you're too sensitive"" ""all these talks about our issues are dumb"" ""I don't need you in my life""

The talks she is referring too is that when I am upset in a relationship, I like to sit down and talk in a way that is ""When you said/ did this, it made me feel like this and I don't like that"" (which I think is the healthy way to argue/fight). When we have these she clams up and doesn't really have much input or she gets very defensive and says hurtful things. Often the apology she leaves me with is one that I'm not satisfied with. Because she doesn't act like she is genuinely sorry. Idk whenever I upset her I feel very guilty and try my best to not do those actions again.

She often tells me how I should and should not feel and that I need to get over it. For reference, she told a pretty big trickle truth lie to me that I was upset over because I think honesty is very important in a relationship and she told me that ""nobody else in the world would care about this, get over it""

I talked to my therapist about it and she said that how my gf tells me how I should and shouldn't feel is a big no no. I agree, but like in the first month she was so good to me and reacted in the correct ways to all these issues, and now she is someone else. It feels like I'm dating an entire new person, this isn't the person I fell in love with.

I am proud of the fact that as a guy I can communicate my emotions with people in a way that is not violent at all. Even when I'm extremely mad at someone I sit down calmly and say ""when you said this it made me feel like this"". I feel like that because I don't yell or act mean when she upsets me she doesn't seem to realize the gravity of how much something hurt or upset me idk, but I don't believe in yelling at people or getting aggressive with words or actions when you are upset, my mom taught me better than that. Maybe I'm a little sensitive but I'm 21 have graduated, has an amazing job, and a very profitable side business and my own place as well. Idk, I feel like my sensitivity and people skills have helped me in being so successful at my young age.

I am currently being stonewalled after I texted her and told her that what she said to me last night hurt my feelings, I'm honestly tired of it. Has anyone been in a relationship like this before? What happened?

I just want things to go back to how she treated me in the first month of dating.

We didn't talk much after that but a month later he visited me for a weekend and we had a wonderful time. He said he knew he was going to have fun but he had more fun that he even expected. After that trip, I was moving back to his hometown in a month so we had plans to meet then. We don't talk much in between that time, aside from one phone call that he initiated. When I do move back to his hometown, we spend time every weekend together and even went on a weekend trip where all his friends were present. While we never discussed this, I heard through the grapevine that he is also regularly seeing some other girl as well. I am not sure what happened with that but a week ago I bring up that I am still seeing other people and he I know he is too. He mentions he is not seeing anyone else at this moment. (He does not, however, tell me that he has stopped or is no longer interested in seeing anyone else- just that there is no one else at this moment). He always plans wonderful luxurious dates, is incredibly thoughtful and chivalrous, pays for everything, and makes plans with me several days in advance to see me one night every weekend.

I just graduated college, and we had been seeing each other since I finished school. It’s been great and we would always have great time together. I feel like she truly understands me and I feel very comfortable and happy with her. 

Despite the vast difference in age, we do like a lot of the same things and could talk on the same level often. It makes me very happy to see her, even though she lives more than an hour away.

I decided to break things off just because I felt like the relationship didn’t have a real future. This is mainly due to how we are both in very different places in life... It sucks, and I really felt like I broke things off in the worst way possible (we had sex, and I told her almost immediately after, I know, shitty... I expect no sympathy from anyone for just that). 

The worst part of all of this is that I felt as though I had no doubt in my mind that she was someone I wanted to be with. I had my doubts that we would end up being together, and when we finally were, that spark just faded in me. I hate how it has to be this way, and I wish I could undo what I’ve done.

Right now, all I really want is to make sure she is okay. It feels like I’m probably the last person she wants to speak with right now, but regardless I want there to be closure (even though this is because of me).

80,o55bgi,1624308956,"How do I salvage a going on 3 year long distance relationship after being hit with ""I wish things could go back to being more casual?""","I (23M) have been seeing a guy (27) who lives 3 hours away for going on 3 years and seeing eachother in person once or twice monthly since November 2020. Normally he comes my way but the last 3 times (March-May) I've finally visited him. The last time we were together was mid-May for four days and everything was completely normal. We've never been exclusive since he's pretty private in that regard and his parents are homophobic but all his main friends know about me.

Since June 6th, he's been more distant and completely unlike himself with me. We still talk daily and he will message me first/be jovial, but saying goodnight on a regular basis has mostly stopped as well as me getting any compliments from him. The last time I did was memorial day.

He told me on June 9th via phone that he wishes things could go back to being more casual but didn't elaborate and claimed he was still very much attracted to me. Both of us split the cost for an expensive hotel room in my area the weekend of July 4th, which is still planned.

I have a feeling it's mostly because he's getting tired of me not working a regular hour job but he's too nice to say that (he works Monday through Friday as a leasing agent and I work remotely as an art dealer for commission, but it isn't consistent.) We've never had a fight or falling out about anything.

I'm not planning on bringing anything up again until he's here unless things get even worse between us in this next week. I really don't want to lose him.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o55bgi/how_do_i_salvage_a_going_on_3_year_long_distance/

Anyways we live in diffrent cities , 240kms away from eachother and he came to see me and we had a perfect date
Now after a week the conversation started going south , he was replying once in two days  and I could see he was online through discord , so anyways I said he may be busy but this continued and it was making me really anxious
Yesterday he apologized for not talking much and asked if he could see me again
So I said sure I can come see you , and I asked him when and how etc , he seened my message and hasn't replied yet ( also online on discord )
I felt like shit because I'm currently studying for a really difficult exam and still I can find the time to text him yet he doesn't rven bother
So I blocked him ...
And now I'm feeling devastated

87,o566sw,1624311247,I (30 M) have come to the harsh realization that I am 100% not ready for a partner.,"I find myself degrading when I get into a relationship. I work less, I focus less on my own maintenance (working out, studying, leisure time, etc), and as things progress, I start to even isolate from my friends/family.  


I do not think that this is the fault of my partner (though I have had a few that have actively tried to drive a wedge between me and my social groups). I think it has to do with some sort of... *need,* of mine, to commit to my partners too much at the expense of myself. I become invested in their issues, problems, and desires so much that I just... get off track, and it's hard for me to maintain.  


And when I stop maintaining myself, I start to stop being the guy that they were attracted to, and start to become a drag. I don't know how to be myself *and* commit to a partner, right now. I feel like I need to be alone to be my best self, at least for now. I still want to meet people, I just don't want to date - I know I'm not healthy enough, mentally, to commit. Weirdly, I actually feel a sense of... relief? Thinking about that. Just a month ago, I was reeling from a breakup. Now I feel much better, though I still have work to do.

It's not that I am saying ""screw dating,"" or even that I never want to date again. It's just that I feel more content by myself, and don't feel the need to rock my own boat to find someone right now, if that makes sense.

90,o569hr,1624311445,Am I the only one who is picky about names when dating???,"Ok, hear me out, I know it sounds shallow and probably is, but for some reason when I’m swiping, even if the man is attractive, if he has an unattractive name, I swipe left. Lol! 

For instance, cute guy, was about to swipe right, then saw his name is Arpit. This has nothing to with his ethnicity, if his name was different I would’ve gone right. all I hear in my head is “will you take Armpit to be your husband?” 

Say, even a dude named P.J. I think abbreviated names are for kids lol. 

Eugene. Bartholomew. Milton. Earl. I have seen these all. 

Or, because my abusers names are John and Jim, I simply cannot bear to date someone with that name.

My ex went by Daniel but I found out that his real name was Herbert. It always made me cringe when I heard it. 

So I know it’s shallow and keeping me from matching nice, attractive men, but I feel like it could be tied to something deeper? Idk.

95,o56ea7,1624311794,Advice for a young guy with hair loss?,"19M here, heading off to university for my first year in a couple months and I've never really dated around. I think the longest I was with a girl in high school was about a week or two and one date exactly after which she made the choice not to go through with it, although she changed her mind a month later and asked if I wanted to try again and I refused, salvaging some dignity. Aside from this though, no action at all except one or two times I made out with girls I basically never talked to again, and that was beginning of HS.

Recently though, (since I was 17) I started balding semi-noticeably and it's getting to the point where I'm almost sure I'd look better with a shaved head, but that's probably some mood swing because I look again and I just think wow, I'm gonna be completely unfuckable after this. So yeah. Armageddon is drawing close and I'm feeling fucking empty.

I only turned 19 a couple months ago and don't have either the money to go get a transplant, nor do I have the interest in pursuing medication that'll fuck with my hormones and body just so I can gamble my health for hair. So I think I'm gonna go through with it, but I'd be lying if I said I was optimistic and not considering ending it all if it's really such an inhibitor in modern dating as a young guy. I just don't see the point in living my whole life alone when it's already getting exhausting seeing everyone have what I can't have with ease.

What do you think? Any other young bald guys care to share their experience? Please do understand that I'm 100% gonna be skeptical as fuck if any girls say they don't care because at the end of the day, I'm still 19, I'm still alone, and I still see the shit people say online all the time.

96,o56gnv,1624311977,Does anyone else feel like a catfish by creating a profile of your most flattering pictures?,"Hi, so I (27F) have been trying online dating again. Id consider myself right around average looking? Pretty average features, a BMI around 27, 5'4"". Nothing crazy. I can't help but think that, when a guy sends me a compliment, its just not genuine. I won't even respond to anyone ""out of my league"" cause I get suspicious, but then am not attracted to the people I'm not suspicious of. 

I'm just always worried im catfishing people by using my most flattering pictures. Most of them are full body, and I dont edit, but I catch myself feeling like I'm actually way fatter than the pictures show. Or uglier. It makes me anxious to actually meet people in person because I dont want to disappoint them, and I just can't engage with anyone that I feel like is ""too hot"". Have any of you felt this way or is there just something wrong with me? How do you cope?

For the record; I've met up with 3 people from dating apps. One was a woman, who was every bit as stunning and engaging as her profile suggested. The other two were men, and their pictures were much more flattering than their actual appearance. I don't want to be on the receiving end of that realization:(

One of my friends said theres this ""first impression syndrome"" where people will see your pictures and project that attractiveness onto you IRL, even if you're maybe just photogenic. Is this true??

Matched with this gorgeous girl on the league app last week. We have spoken briefly say 20 messages back and forth. Got her phone number and trying to move it towards an in-person meeting a few days later.

I asked her out for drinks later this week to escalate things and move them forward and she took 24 hours to respond to my text and she didn't even answer my question. I don't care how good she looks I am not going to waste time if she is just seeking attention and doesn't want to actually date. So going with 1 more shot before I move on.

 ***TEXT 1***: You weren’t kidding, you are bad at texting, you didn’t even respond to my message :P. But seriously, we’ve all mostly been in isolation for 1.5 years so I’m looking to connecting with people. You are a cute girl, who, from what I can tell seems to have a cool personality. I’m curious to get to know you better. 1 text a day doesn’t really do that and I’m not looking for a penpal.

***TEXT 2***: If you are down to make plans to get to know each other better in person that is great, let’s plan something, even a video call works. If you aren’t ready, that is cool too.

99,o56lrh,1624312375,My ex is making me emotionally unavailable to other men.,"
I recently got out of a 6 year relationship with my ex. It ended because he cheated on me. He has been very apologetic and didn’t want to break up but I insisted we had to. This was two months ago. I had to move to a new city to live with my parents and recently got a new job here. 

A month after our break up I met a guy on tinder. I told him that I’m newly single and how I wasn’t really sure if I wanted anything too serious too soon. We went on four dates and he seems very interested in me, and I do enjoy spending time with him as well. 

I just started working at my new job a week ago so it’s been a little stressful. Also, this entire week my ex has been messaging and calling me about how he misses me and wants me back. I have no intentions of getting back with him, but at the same time it’s really been messing with me emotionally. We were together for so long and had a future planned out together and it ended so drastically that I feel I haven’t really accepted the breakup entirely. I don’t want to get back with him but I’m also having a very hard time with my emotions on the situation and just hearing from him has made me anxious and I’ve been avoiding my phone entirely. I still care about him but I also know he isn’t right for me. 

The new guy I’m seeing wants to take me on a date this week and he messaged me earlier today. I haven’t responded yet. I just feel like I’m so stressed out and emotionally exhausted from hearing from my ex and starting my new job I just am so overwhelmed. I like spending time with this new guy but I’m not sure if I’m ready fully to continue with it. We already hung out and been intimate and I feel bad if I avoid him now all the sudden but my ex has made me feel almost guilty about seeing a new guy for some twisted reason. I don’t think I want to hang out this week with the new guy because I should probably take some time for myself but I also don’t want him to think I’m ditching him for my ex (cause I’m not)

Should I tell the new guy about my ex messaging me and how it’s stressing me it and that I need time alone for a bit? Someone pleas help me. I feel so lost.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o56lrh/my_ex_is_making_me_emotionally_unavailable_to/
