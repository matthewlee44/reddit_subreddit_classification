I've used OLD for 2 years and while i get some matches it has only lead to 1 date. 

- What physical attributes do you believe set you up for success? Muscle? Good looking? Style? Etc..

Why I say physical attribute is because most dating apps is just that. 

I know that it's generally harder for men etc. But the men that succeed I wonder what makes them succeed.

Women are welcome to share their experience of what they think too.

2,n67bgv,1620307822,"Mixed signals of interest from girl, maybe playing games?","So on Monday I went on a date with this girl I met over bumble, we grabbed some food 
,went to the mall and sat and talked for hours. She showed good body language(constant eye contact) was very complimentary and spoke about how she wanted to do this again. 

For a little bit of backstory, the girl is a pretty well known YouTuber and I was aware of this from the get go which didn’t chNge much for me but prior to our first date her texting was spotty at best. I always just figured she was busy working or what not. At first we would text often but it gradually got less and less which I honestly didn’t mind because I’d rather get to know someone in person anyways. So anyways, Tuesday we exchanged a few texts after our date and later on in the night she happened to ask me to get on a video game but I had passed out which happens often when she asks me to play because it’s often late and I work mostly early mornings. I responded to her around 2 yesterday apologizing and she responded, after I responded back tho she’s said nothing and it’s been almost a day which has never happened. I follow her on ig and she was active on her story multiple times so now I’m confused as to if she’s already lost interest in me this quickly or maybe I made a mistake somehow to lose her interest. I’ve also entertained the possibility that she’s maybe playing some sort of game with me but I’m not to sure. I’m just looking for some suggestions on what I should do next, I would like to see her again for a second date but I don’t know if I should ask now.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n67bgv/mixed_signals_of_interest_from_girl_maybe_playing/

9,n69hna,1620313823,Why don’t guys understand sex is an emotion-provoking act for women (cis-het dominant convo),"I’ve heard and seen a lot of men complain that they want to take things slow with processes like prioritizing women and complaining about how rushed they feel when they don’t want a relationship (and a woman does). so, I am here to tell you guys out there that, if you are rushing or pressing your sexual desires upon your dates or person you are “talking to”, expect to be pressed about a relationship. We are very vulnerable creatures. We are way more susceptible to disease than you guys will ever be. This is because intercourse involves a membrane for us called the mucosa membrane. This very vulnerable membrane is the same membrane that gets dicks wet. So yes, when you fuck us, we invest in you a lot of trust. We won’t say it outright, but our trust in you is for us what we lowkey expect y’all to have with us. You put your dick there, aren’t you just as worried about disease as you are the loyalty and trustworthiness of your partner? These things easily fall hand in hand. So if you don’t want a girl rushing to any type of conclusions, maybe you should wait until she actually initiates the act of sex. Wait til she can’t resist you (it happens, trust). Make her beg for some dick even. But for the love of god, please stop screaming victim whilst antagonizing.

12,n6a523,1620315550,Sexual choking: miscommunication or red flag?,"I (30F) just started dating a new guy (29M) Sam. I was in a long term physically abusive relationship before this which I was honest about with Sam. Sam told me many times how his type is innocent, wholesome good girls. His example was Mandy Moore from A Walk to Remember (he was referring mainly to personality for this example)

After the 5th date, we made out for the first time (at this point, we have not had any conversation about what we like sexually/boundaries etc). About 1 min into us making out, he started to choke me, lightly but with two hands and his thumbs pressing lightly into my windpipe in the center. I felt uncomfortable but I wasn’t sure why I felt uncomfortable since I do enjoy erotic, sexual choking. I felt it was weird to do it so quickly (in the relationship and quickly in regards to what we were doing, we had just started kissing) and without asking first. I’ve never had a man do it that quickly and without talking about it first. I also felt it was confusing that he said he likes innocent women (and he thought I was an innocent woman at this point) but he was choking right off the bat.

Afterward he said “sorry, I’m an aggressive dominant guy so just let me know if it’s too much” so I asked “so you like to choke?” And he said “yea I do” and I said “okay I do like it occasionally as long as it’s done lightly and with one hand”.  Since then I’ve gotten very contradictory messages from him and this general feeling of unease. He’s continued to choke with two hands every time we make out. We haven’t had PIV sex yet, honestly because I’m hesitating that he might be dangerous. We’ve done oral though.

This last time he choked me much harder than before with two hands, thumbs pressing into the center of my neck into my windpipe, which scared the hell out of me. We had a conversation about it and I said I felt scared. I don’t enjoy choking like that, only when it’s done with one hand, very lightly with very light pressure on the sides. Now he’s backtracking and saying he doesn’t even like choking.

This isn't the first time he's contradicted himself and I'm starting to get scared since things have already escalated with him choking me harder. Some other contradictions:
- he spent a lot of time with his hands/mouth focused on ass play (starting from the first time he was down there, and completely bypassed the vagina to focus on the ass, and without us discussing it). when I asked if he was into ass play, he said ""no not really"" and then the 2nd time I asked him, he said ""okay I lied, I am really into ass play""
- he said he was a dominant guy but always positions us so he's on the bottom. Even if I ask if we can make out with him on top of me for a change, one minute in and he asks to switch back to being on the bottom. When I asked him about this, he said he likes being on top better, but that’s not what he’s doing. (we're just making out, no sex. so this isn't a case of being lazy or tired and not wanting to do the work. there's no work to be done.)
- he said he's an aggressive guy but the only instances of aggression Ive seen are the choking and pushing my head down during oral sex (which I already told him is a no and that I don't like that). When I asked for his clarification on what “aggressive” means, he says “kissing you against a wall, picking you up” but he’s done none of that, he actually always positions us so he’s the one being pressed against something. 
- he said “he’s a freak” so I asked what does that mean, what kind of porn do you watch. He says he doesn’t watch any porn but he won’t clarify what he means by freak.
- he said he likes good wholesome innocent girls  (which again that’s what he thought I was the first time we made out) but he choked me within 1 min of us making out the very first time 
- while talking about a true crime podcast where the murderer had a history of sadistic sexual fantasies, Sam said “I can’t understand men like that, who get sexual pleasure from hurting women” and yet he choked me one minute into us making out for the first time
- he knew I was physically abused in the past. He asked me “did he hit you” and I answered honestly “yes he did” and Sam said “oh that makes me so mad, that a man would hurt a woman.” And yet, he choked me one minute into us making out the first time
- Mandy Moore from a walk to remember would absolutely not be interested in choking or ass play so how is that his type?

I’ve tried to have conversations with him about my concerns and confusion and I just end up more confused. I told him that his words and actions aren’t lining up and I’m very confused. My therapist, 3 friends, my friends boyfriend all have told me to “be careful” and that this isn’t normal.

I’m afraid that he’s into some dark sadistic stuff sexually but he doesn’t want to tell me because he’s afraid I won’t approve which is why he backtracks and won’t tell me what kind of porn he watches. And his type is “good girls” because they’re naive and easier to manipulate. But I don’t know if this is me projecting. Every time we hook up, the next day I feel repulsed thinking back on it. 

Is this inexperience, miscommunication or a red flag? At 29, shouldn’t he know to get consent before he chokes a woman? Am I reading too much into this or is he genuinely not being straight with me on purpose?

13,n6acmo,1620316093,My girlfriend keeps his ex's number on her phone,"Ok, so, me and my gf started off as friends, so she used to share things with me. Somewhere like 8 months ago, she mentioned this dude whom she has been with before. She also said that, if he changed, she could give him another chance. Okay. We started dating like 3 months ago. Some days ago, I noticed that she still had his number saved, and followed him on Instagram. I confronted her about it, and she said that she simply forgot to delete it. She then proceeded to delete and unfollow him.

It still bugs me though. I'm a very focused person, and I don't want to risk the possibility of her going back to him in the future, because it would destroy me. Quora says that it's totally normal to keep the ex's contact on your phone, but it's simply not true for me, because I have cut contacts with everyone I've been with before. She says she loves me and doesn't care about him, but it's still bugging me, since she mentioned that chance thing.

19,n6bhsl,1620319091,Rejection.,"I’ve been thinking about the way people turn others down for dates, for a second date, or end things after a few weeks.

Most people, make excuses. Or they explain themselves to justify their saying no. Or they offer an apology.

I think apologizing to someone when they’ve asked you out and you said no makes them feel worse. It’s like your offering pity. Your telegraphing to them that you expect this to really hurt. I really think that apologizing or honestly adding reasons everyone knows aren’t really true (I’m  not looking to date right now, I’m too busy, etc) makes them feel worse.

Also, there is nothing to be sorry for and no one should have to apologize for not wanting to date someone. 

-

I refuse to explain myself to any more men when I tell them I won’t date them anymore, or turn down a date. 

They almost always try and argue with me about it. I’ve literally told men I have a deal breaker and they’re like “that’s okay we can date anyway! Or “let’s debate that” (what the fuck is that? I what way could I be ‘wrong’ about my preferences?)

So as a matter of principle I will not give reasons, or apologize. 

- 

My question is this, how would you say no to a date, a second date, or end things after a few dates or weeks WITHOUT offering justifications, reasons or an apology?

The truth is, I don’t owe them anything, and I’m not ashamed of never putting all of my eggs in one basket! 

Far too often I’ve invested early on into relationships that went nowhere or ended poorly. Nowadays, I will absolutely not be taking my posts down or stopping my search just because I met someone new, which is what all of you all should be doing on both ends!

27,n6cjnr,1620321870,Is she interested?,"So I have a coworker who over the past couple weeks I've realized I've interested in her, and I think she may be interested in me because of some things she has been doing. However I'm not sure if that is just how she normally is or maybe I'm just over analyzing things. And also I'm very rusty at dating and haven't had any sort of dating experience since back in highschool about 6 years ago.

Just for context we work night shift at a care facility for developmentally disabled adults with about 15 different buildings and typically 2-4 staff per building. So I don't get to talk to that much and have only worked with her 3-4 times. 

Here are the main signs I've noticed:

-So the othernight on our building we were talking for a good portion of our free time that night, and she talked to me much more than she talked to the other two staff on that building (one male, and one female).

 -And during that night she asked me for advice quite a few different times, even though she knows I'm not a regular on that building. 

-during our conversations with 3-4 people it appeared that she was looking at me more than she would at other people.



-then last night we were together on a different building yet opposite sides of it (however we were overstuffed on that building) . And during the beginning of shift we got to talking about things we liked and she wanted to show me a picture of her dog I believe. And she got rather close to me while showing me and apologized if she was too close but I told her it was fine. 

-A bit later she wanted to talk to me about a some animes that she liked and I might be interested in and said she might put on this one anime movie on the smart TVs we have on the buildings if we have the time tonight and said I should watch it with her. She showed me the trailer for it on her phone and again got pretty close to me and apologized if she was invading my personal space. 

- a bit later she mentioned this one anime movie she really wanted to see but she said it sucks cause it was only in theaters right now and she can't watch it anywhere else. (I may be reading too much into this but I feel like in a way it was her mentioning something we could do together...)

- then she asked me for advice on what to do with some stuff 

- and finally, shortly before the end of shift started hovering around my side of the building in the area where I was a couple times, and I asked her if she was looking for the shift charge and she said she wasn't then just went back over to her side.

31,n6d30u,1620323299,So... popular dating apps for Asians + other non-OLD options?,"As the title says - I'm not getting much luck if any, when it comes to dating. I tried putting myself out there over the past 2 years at the bars in my city, trying to strike up conversation and meet women, but no one was really interested in talking to me. Same thing with OLD on the normal apps... Tinder, Bumble etc. I don't think I've had a like on my profile, let alone a match in 2 months. I do believe I'm a reasonably well put together guy... I have a stable career, a degree, my own place, hobbies, etc.. it gets kinda hard to keep positive but what else can one do?

A conversation with a female friend of mine resulted in the brutal honesty that most women here in her experience do not consider Asian men an option when it comes to dating. Considering where I am (Europe), it wouldn't surprise me if this is the case.. I'm not short or small per se but compared to the national average here I definitely come in below, and there aren't many Asians to begin with. I'm not complaining or anything, its just the way the world works - nor am I discounting dating people that aren't Asian, I'm just of the mindset that if it's not exactly working out I'd like to try in circles where I at least look like most of the other men out there, to see whether that would maybe yield some measure of success. As much as I like to say I do not worry about this I am nearing 30 and the thought of having someone to share life with remains in the back of my mind. 

As such, I was wondering if anyone had any experience with any of the Asian dating apps that work/are effective outside Asia? Failing that, I'd be interested in knowing what other 'settings' beyond OLD or nightlife would work for meeting a potential date or romantic interest in my situation. My hobbies are video games (I know..) and working on old cars, so there really isn't much female involvement in those areas either.

42,n6fw4o,1620330613,Never meeting LT BFs parents,"So I need some advice on this since I get mixed opinions elsewhere. My (22f) boyfriend (21m) met over 2 years ago on a dating app and slowly got to know each other which progressed into dating. We live 10-15 minutes away from each other and I have not met his parents, he’s asked me a few times but I have stated that I will not meet them as of now. His parents are Christian reformed and extremely strict ( people in his family get married out of college, save themselves for marriage). We drink together and are intimate which is a huge red flag for his parents, but normal today. I avoid them at all costs and they know little about me. My view on it is if they can’t be accepting of anyone and more open minded they just don’t deserve much of me since I don’t “fit the mold”. It’s also odd that they used to tell him to find someone at his school to marry ( Christian college) and basically give him rules to his life, can’t they accept that I love him no matter my religion? He also has religious trauma and smokes weed/ nicotine to cope being around them which is hard for me to see.

This might sound like an odd topic but I need opinions on what it possibly means when a bartender is attentive to everyone at a bar but singles an individual out. This happens to me occasionally at this bar &amp; grill I go to. 

First off, I've known her for about six months now and I do like her. We get along very well but I notice certain things with her. For example, she tends to be more attentive to me on days when there's very few to no people at the bar but when there is a lot of people,  she attends to everyone else except me. I understand she's busy and has her hands full but she doesn't ask if I need/want anything, she singles me out. When there's very little to no people at and I order a water or soda (I don't really drink), she goes to the extent where she'll pour my beverage for me but when there's a full bar, she doesn't. 

However, there's a catch. She has a boyfriend. Obviously, I respect their relationship and I keep a good friendship with her, but this whole thing with her singling me out is strange. Aside from her not doing her job in that sense, I don't know if she does this because she likes to primarily be attentive to me when we're alone or what. She has also been flirtatious/physical with me only once and that was her scratching my back a certain way about a month ago. I Aldo tend to catch her staring at me sometimes and she loves to smile at me too.. I have a feeling I'm possibly her backup.

47,n6h4oh,1620333738,Your biggest dating mistake is feeling sorry for yourself.,"I see it on this sub all the time —

""I'm too ugly to get a date or have a relationship""

""Women are so shallow""

""Dating for women is so much easier than it is for men""

""They only want me for my body/wallet/free therapy""

""I'm too nice to get a relationship"" (can someone explain that one, lol?)

And it goes on.

For everything I mentioned above, plus whatever negative beliefs you have about yourself with regards to dating — odds are you're wrong, but because you believe these things about yourself, you're making it your reality.

If you think you're too ugly to date, you will behave as if you're too ugly to date, regardless of what you look like. Your self esteem issues and negativity will roll off you in waves and no one will want to date you even if they can see past your supposedly unloveable face. You think you're too nice, too much of a pushover, and women don't find it attractive — you're right, because you're going to become guarded and transactional about your dating life, or wildly insecure about your relationships, and no one wants that.

I'm not saying that we don't all have things we can improve about ourselves. You think you're ugly, and maybe you could work on your skincare or get a better haircut, but at the end of the day what holds you back more than anything else is the way you think about yourself. Your dates can tell. You're not hiding it. It impacts your behavior in subtle and obvious ways that you can try to mitigate, but people are intuitive creatures. 

The first thing you have to improve before you even start swiping is your self esteem, and how you think about yourself. If you have a high opinion of yourself, rejection stings less. You stop pinning all the weight of failure on yourself and maybe you can develop a more objective view of things, like ""Maybe we're not compatible"" or ""Maybe they're not looking for a serious relationship right now,"" rather than ""I'm too worthless to date"" or ""Of course they didn't text me back, I'm so ugly.""

This isn't some law of attraction bullshit. If there's any situation where the law of attraction makes any sense, it's with dating. If you expect the worst, you'll approach your dates and dating life like they're threats, and you will find the worst case scenario you're looking for. And if you expect good things, maybe you won't always find good things, but you will stop blaming yourself for everything that goes wrong, and you'll be better off for it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n6h4oh/your_biggest_dating_mistake_is_feeling_sorry_for/

What this means is that I may notice that she’s being nice and then sit and think about “Well, was she flirting or was she just being friendly?” Then I find out later that she was flirting. I’m also not much better in texting. I like many others have had texts be misinterpreted because obviously you don’t have the inflection that you would naturally would if you were verbally saying it. To avoid that, I just don’t discuss things like crushes or asking about that over text because I don’t want it misunderstood. 


Is there anyway I can get better at that? I’m not worried about rejection or anything because I’m an actor, so I know that not everything works out. I’m worried about missing chances, especially since I already have before.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n6iemg/how_can_i_16m_tell_if_a_girl_likes_me/
66,n6iosj,1620337747,"I recently found out I might be asexual. Going forward, how should I express this detail to the women I meet?","Hello there. I a 27M, and recently realized I might be asexual. I relate to a lot of memes and thoughts in the ace community. Very recently, I have read a post on a different subreddit about a lady who was devastated that her boyfriend was ace, and realized that my lack of sexual expression may be sending the wrong signals and explains why nearly all my first and second dates don’t lead anywhere.  

I won’t go into too much details on my history, but long story sort, I want to learn how to let my date know that just because I might not instinctually go for the kiss or want to go to their place tonight, doesn’t mean I am not interested in doing that eventually. 

Reading the lady’s post from earlier, I totally understand it I might not be worth the investment. I also understand how some women might interpret my lack of instant sexual desires might make them feel insecure, especially since I don’t know how long it will take for me to become interested in sexual self expression with them. 

To be clear, I eventually want to get sexual for intimacy sake. I do get horny. My horniness is why the thought never occurred that I might be ace. I thought I was ‘normal’ lol. I just don’t feel comfortable rushing into things with someone I don’t know. 

Any advice is appreciated! Thanks.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n6iosj/i_recently_found_out_i_might_be_asexual_going/

69,n6j0w2,1620338649,"Men say ""women give terrible dating advice on how to date other women""... Do you feel this is also true for men?","As a woman, I do feel often women don't give great dating advice on dating women.

But what about men? I ask because the common ""advice"" I often see given here is not what I observe actually working in attracting men, at least in the beginning. 

The common advice I see here is: men love no makeup, they want a woman who approaches them first/asks them out, they find a woman paying her way (or even for him sometimes) sexy, and a woman who is completely straight-forward and does NOT play ""hard to get"" is the ideal woman. 

In REAL LIFE, I don't see it often working out like that at all. The women at social events, bars, concerts, on dating apps, on social media, etc, getting the most dates/opportunity/approaches are flashy women with makeup, hair extensions, fake nails, dressed up etc. These are the women men are buying drinks for, flirting with, chasing down, at much higher %s than the everyday modest Sally. 

My girl friends and I have noticed that men have tried the hardest for us when were a bit ""mysterious"" and not the most upfront. They'd chase us, hit us up more often, try harder. But when we showed emotional availability and didn't play games, we began to get taken for granted. 

So let's be *completely honest* here guys... Do you think it goes both ways? That often what men ""want"" to me attracted to, or don't think they like... actually IS what they respond positively to? 

I know this behavior won't stick for an actual romantic relationship, but in terms of maximizing potential with people we're interested in/attracted to, are men/women just giving eachother bad dating advice all around?

74,n6jd3s,1620339566,Sending a flirty text that I think is now the wrong move...,"So I (f20) have talking over text with another woman (f18) for about 5 months and we've met up quite a few times. We're both not sure what we're looking for long-term, but I know that I'm already really into her. Because we've gotten to know each other pretty well, I feel like we have a sense of the other's personality and humor. 

Whenever we link up, we have awesome conversation, laugh a lot, and have overall great chemistry. The only awkward part is at the end where we hug goodbye and I don't know if it's cool for me to lean in. So far, I have not initiated any physical contact other than a hug because I don't want to seem too eager or make her uncomfortable, and neither has she. I actually prefer to move slow, but I'm wondering where we stand, whether it's romantic or if we're slowly going into the friend zone. So after the last time we hung out, she was gushing about how great the date was, so I thought it'd be a good time to gauge where her head is at. I sent a text poking fun about how we haven't kissed yet to keep it light, and she has not responded yet. It has been two days and still radio silence. The text was not gross or crude, it was just about me being too shy to have kissed her yet :/ I'm not usually too much of a flirt, and don't send flirty texts that often, so me doing this was already daunting for me, even though it's probably tame for most people. 

Anyway, now I'm freaking out for real! I'm thinking I should send a follow up text if she doesn't reply, maybe apologizing or explaining myself, but I definitely do not want to make things worse.

76,n6jelz,1620339680,My friend says dating as a 40 year old guy is easy. I've always thought he was full of shit. Now I'm about to find out... is he right?,"Clearly experience may vary.  I never expected to be joining him as a divorcee but here I am.  I may wait a few more months because I want to focus on getting my new townhouse setup and hitting the gym a bit, being sure I'm really ready.  But I am kinda excited about the idea of being able to meet new people.  I always did well dating as a younger man.

I guess I'm just kinda concerned because he makes it sound so easy, especially for men.  He's not cocky talking up like he's a player (really he's FAR from a player), I think it's more that he says we both he and I make good money, we're clean-cut professionals.  We're safe, sane, stable, rational adults who can carry on conversations.  No kids in his case, I have two - but I'm not trying to make anyone new part of their lives (in fact I want to keep a lot of distance there, kind of a mutual agreement with the ex who just wants to protect our kids - and I'm cool with that).

But anyway, I guess my friend just makes it sound so easy like there's so many divorced women and most guys in their late 30's or early 40's are just bums, failure-to-launch types.  Clean shave, clean apartment, be in decent shape, and don't have a PS5 laying around... and it's easy!  Or so he says.  He seems confident I'm going to have a line around the block.  Maybe he's just trying to make me feel good.  As for him, I've seen him bring lady friends to parties for years... there's a new one every few months, and they're always good-looking and seem fun.  He's a childfree-type so I think that becomes a deal killer in the long run for him.  But he always seems to be punching outside his weightclass with these ladies, which I guess kinda backs up his story a bit?

Anyway, I guess I'm just curious for all the men (or ladies) around 40... is it hard to find someone, is it easier for men or women?  Does gender even make a difference is it just hard regardless?  Or IS it super easy?  I know OLD gets a bad rap, but it was kinda new when I was last single... I think it sounds kinda awesome to have that filter of a profile and a bit of texting to get to know someone a bit first.  Even if it comes with the hassle of a few non-connects or ghosts (not my style, but whatever).  What's it been like for you fellow middle-agers?

I also expressed that I wasn’t looking for anything too serious because of my semi-recent breakup, but that I am down for monogamy if I’m getting what I need out of the situation. He said he wasn’t “good boyfriend material” from the start, again because he recently had a breakup of a much shorter and less serious relationship. Cool! Seems like what I want. 

We’ve hung out several times. The sex is fucking great. He is hilarious and I feel like he listens to me. I... really think I like him. It seems like dangerous territory to be feeling for someone who told you they “weren’t good boyfriend material”. Should I bolt? I’ve told him before that I like him. I mean, at the end of the day I suppose I don’t really care much if he wants to see other people as long as I don’t have to hear about it, but I’d definitely rather have him all to myself if he wanted that. I don’t want to get my feelings hurt or make him feel like I’m too attached. I’ve never been in such a casual situation where I spontaneously developed feelings! This isn’t like me. Haha. This is not the hookup I was expecting to have! 

I’m torn between wanting to have a good time and enjoying hanging out with him, and wanting to protect my feelings!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n6l9h2/i_think_i_like_someone_who_is_emotionally/

97,n6lk6h,1620345920,Since my breakup men disgust me,"My “boyfriend” and I broke up 3 months ago, since then I’ve had a few guys express their interest in getting to know me but the whole idea and concept of dating completely repulses me. I’ve been more heartbroken before this breakup and was still interested in giving other men a chance. But after this breakup it’s like a flip switched, I just feel over it. The idea of being with a man, a man touching me and me giving my attention and effort to man is repulsive. A sweet kind man will talk or flirt with me and all I’m thinking is “ewe, why is he talking to me”. I feel like I’ve taken on a narcissist ideology of myself ? Idk I look at them and all I can think is they really don’t deserve me.... is this normal, has anyone else experienced this. I still see myself marrying on the future but I simply cannot picture myself taking the steps to meet someone without getting an “ick”. Everything about them annoys me now... how do I get over this, what is causing it wtf. I don’t even necessarily want to date right now I just don’t want to be disgusted with men. Like they didn’t all do me dirty but somehow I can’t separate that and they all gross me out.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n6lk6h/since_my_breakup_men_disgust_me/
98,n6llqn,1620346034,Gonna be honest,"I'm gonna be honest. Asking people on dates isn't that hard unless you don't have confidence...there's no need to create a complicated formula to ask a guy or girl out. Just ask if they wanna hangout or something and get to know them naturally as friends and if you find them interesting and they find you interesting then ask to hangout again. That's how I do things anyway. 

""Hey you're cute and I'd like to get to know you, do you wanna hangout? It doesn't have to be a date."" If she says no then that's it don't ask again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n6llqn/gonna_be_honest/
