I love my parents but they want to know everything I do. I know it’s a habit because they still think of me as a young teenager, but I can’t leave the house without informing them. 

I tried to go on a date off bumble a few weeks ago and I had to tell my mum and she made such a big deal about it, like how scary it is to meet up with someone and how ‘she just couldn’t tell my dad’ that I was doing it because he’d be worried - I was already a bit jittery being the first time I’d met up with someone online and I bailed. I just couldn’t stand the awkwardness of my mum knowing where I was going and what I was doing and quizzing me over how it went when I got home.

This is doing my head in. I really want to meet someone but (a) my parents live in the middle of nowhere so there’s nowhere in town. I’m currently travelling over an hour to work and 2.5 hours to uni and (b) using online dating seems hopeless living at home. Even if I wanted to try something casual, it seems impossible because mum would want to know EVERYTHING. 

One year and I’ll have finished uni and maybe be in a position to buy a house. My savings are slowly climbing. But how am I going to make it through this last year?

The texting slowed down and she became less responsive to the point she didn’t respond. I left it for a week and heard nothing from her (we both had some big things to deal with so thought best to get them out of the way before having that sort of conversation). So I text her again asking about and she tells me she just didn’t feel a romantic connection.

Then I got angry and actually banged on the door twice.

Then he unblocked me and texted “Get the fuck out and stop beating on my door for real. Fuck off. Are you fucking psychotic”

Then my messages went green again like he blocked and then unblocked me. He also blocked me on all social media. I can’t think of anything I did or why he would do that.

I have one friend who is now engaged. When he was dating his fiancé, she told me multiple times that I would be her 2nd choice if my friend ever died or something like that.

Then, another group of friends and I went out drinking. I drove us home as I was the only sober one in the group and was able to clearly hear this whole conversation. My buddy told his wife that he knows she would sleep with me if they weren't married to which she just told him to shut up.

Finally, a third group of friends has a friend's wife that is very touchy when she gets drunk. I've noticed that she is this way with me and her husband (my friend). It is strange.

While all of these encounters are awkward and I don't care to have ever been in them, it makes me wonder why I've had trouble getting into a relationship or having friends hook me up with their friends.

I'm 28 and have never had an official girlfriend. I've seen people for a few months but it always ends because I'm agnostic (live in a religious part of the country).  There has yet to be mutual attraction between myself and another woman, though instances have risen where myself or them are interested but the other party isn't.

I (21F) will be meeting a man (28M) in person for the first time next month, assuming our schedules work out.

He would love to stay at my place if I’m comfortable with it but ultimately I don’t think it will be a good idea since my parents will be out of town and just my brother (19M) will be home.

He made it clear that he doesn’t want me to feel pressured into doing anything that I don’t want to, and that he has slept in his car before sometimes. Ultimately I’m just too empathetic.

When in these modern times everyone is fighting for more equality and fairness in all walks of life. Yet it's quite puzzling that in the year 2021 this is something most women I have met struggle with and find unreasonable to overcome nor comprehend. 

My rule of thumb and belief has always been that if we don't know each other like that yet, and we are just meeting for the first time, not seriously dating, nor in any official relationship. We both should at least for the sake of fairness and equality agree to pay for everything 50-50 or for each to pay for their own.

She is a very capable colleague and I learned a lot from her. As a person she is intelligent, diligent, and kind to everyone and anyone. I have a lot of respect for her. I finally had the courage to ask her out two months ago, she vaguely said we can grab a coffee some time. 
Since I had asked her out, we simply haven’t spoken much, let alone arranging a date. This is in part because we don’t get to see each other a lot at work anyway; but when we did see each other she seemed to be avoiding me quite subtly by busying herself with work, or just avoiding situations where we could have talked alone.
I had an opportunity to speak to her today and just gently asked how she felt about my attention and about going on a date. At this point she looked a bit uneasy and her eyes looked wet; and she explained that she has been quite busy the last month or so, and would ‘grab a coffee and get to know each other’ in the New Year because she was going to her parents’ for Christmas.

Here is my dilemma: my gut instinct is that she is not really interested in me but was too kind / polite to say no. But she has said she would go out with me, and indeed the situation has not been convenient for her. I don’t know how best to interpret what she had said and done - should I continue to try and arrange a date after she had come back?

Before you ask, I do have means to contact her outside of work but I thought it is too invasive if I did do so.

If you’re putting your eggs in one basket with a person who is Lukewarm or early on isn’t exhibiting behaviors that show interest and respect, understand that you will save your heart and mind from struggle by simply walking away.

Regardless of how attractive someone is or what they say, we must pay attention to what they do, patterns of behavior, and the power we have as individuals to say “No, I will not be treated this way” and find someone who will treat you in the way that you’d like.

The majority of us have rejected someone, have given someone a lack of attention because we’re not as interested, and sometimes didn’t provide a thesis to them or held their hand.

If you have to question why someone isn’t as engaged or interested as you are, it’s best to walk away and come across people who are. If someone says no to your request for a date then changes their mind weeks later, you weren’t/aren’t their first choice.

If we don’t walk away early on, we set ourselves up to be mismanaged and mistreated. Every human has value and in dating we must TAKE CLAIM of our power to walk away from someone you’re incompatible with, someone who doesn’t share your communication style, or someone who simply doesn’t care as much as you would like them to as shown by their actions. 

You’ll avoid mental gymnastics, pain, and suffering by walking away.

Dating is a numbers game and involves good timing for both individuals. The only power you have is over yourself and your reactions to things. Stand strong in your worth, male or female. We are all worthy of a good love and respect.

Walk away at the first sign of disrespect, not replying for a day or days, someone being wishy-washy, someone who doesn’t value your time, a catfish, and other situations that do not serve you. Leave at the first sign! 

A guy who says I want a relationship but only wants sex (he will use you) or a woman who goes hot and cold (she is using you for slight entertainment or busy with others she likes most likely).

Don’t think people are unaware of how they’re treating you! Do you really think someone is unaware that they aren’t giving you attention, care or respect? No!

I’m gonna go extremely honest and without political correctness in what I say here. Many humans are selfish creatures. Some people live to have their desires fulfilled and fuck all. 

Sometimes we come across someone who is in the gray zone for filling our desires or we’re bored or it might be a good fuck so we stick around long enough to have our carnal or mental desires met without giving this person emotional investment. You are literally a pawn to be toyed with and there is little guilt from the issuing party! 

How do you protect yourself from this? How do you not waste your time? You walk away. Walking away starts with a decision in the mind to honor and respect yourself enough to not take the treatment or conditions you’ve been given from another. It is also a muscle.

We must believe that we are valuable, have self-confidence, and believe in abundance as part of our driving force to easily walk away. There’s so many people out here to date!

Date more than 1 person at once! Have flavors at the same time to see how different people truly are! They truly are.

Person A may not treat you like Person B. So why the hell should you stick around and wait for Person A to tell you they value you through their actions, reply to text, reply after sex, or show interest when there’s so many out there waiting to connect with you for something better.

Hold fast to the value you have as a person and walk away when shit is uncertain and the person simply isn’t there like you are. 

How many people have you met in your life up until this point? Did you like them all? Do you feel that every interaction was actually meaningful? Why not treat dating in the same way? 

If they aren’t interested, they aren’t interested. Don’t hope for the best but live in reality and be reminded of abundance and the value you have as a person. If you aren’t being treated the way you would like or have to question, walk away.

27F Earlier this week on Wed, we went out to dinner and talked for 3 hrs. We’ve been in contact via Instagram messages. Friday we talked on the phone to buy tickets &amp; see the Spider-Man movie yesterday. Fri evening I asked if he could stop sending those IG video reels politely, it was a bit overboard. Yesterday before the movie, he said good morning and I replied with a wave emoji. He normally would continue the conversation via Instagram but doesn’t message again until he said he was waiting at the theater. I was not as bubbly as I was on Wednesday, I was very quiet (not against him). He was annoying me during the movie, he’s the type to laugh and make noises when something exciting came on. He nudged me during the movie and asked if I was ok because I was quiet and I said yes. At the end I told him thanks, he said you’re welcome and he said drive safe. On Wednesday, we ended with a hug. When I spoke with him Friday, he told me that he talked about me with his friends but yesterday was so off, he sent a message after movie saying that he wasn’t really feeling it from me and it’s not going to work for him. He unmatched with me on the dating app and I stopped following him on IG. Bit soon to say but he’s still following me on IG and viewed my stories after saying he didn’t want to talk to me anymore.

This could potentially read like I’m just insanely oblivious to girls hitting on me, which is probably the case lmfao. Basically, a girl I’ve had a bit of a crush on at work and I have been getting closer. I thought things were getting a little flirty between us over time but I was also pretty sure it was all in my head because I saw zero possibility she could actually be into me, she’s way out of my league. After work a few days ago she told me she’d need to message me later to fill me in on some work gossip. I thought that seemed like just a bit of an excuse to slide into my dms, but again, I’m oblivious, so I just told her I was looking forward to it and then promptly forgot about it. I thought she was joking in all honesty, a kind of half hearted ‘I’ll message you’ that people say and forget. 

Anyway, to my surprise, she messaged me later that night and we’ve been talking on and off ever since. We’ve both been working crazy hours but we soon both have a few days off, and today she messaged me saying ‘when we finally get to our days off we should go out and celebrate together’.

Now I’m dense, but even I’m not that stupid. I instantly assumed holy shit, she’s trying to slyly ask me out. That was this morning though and since then she hasn’t even opened my reply saying that we definitely should. 

So since she hasn’t replied or even opened the conversation since I am doubting myself.  My self-esteem is ridiculously low though so I feel like I can’t judge this well. So, was this her attempt at asking me out? Logically I want to say yes, because when I think about the kind of flirty vibes between us, her making an excuse to message me first, implying we should at the very least hang out, etc., it seems to much of a coincidence if nothing is going on. But the other part of me is saying she isn’t into you, she’s just being friendly, why would she really be into you, if she really was she would have followed up immediately when you said yes, etc.

I love him. We are close. We havent been in constant communication all of these years but whenever we do have it its great and fluid.

Backstory= i have been seeing someone (random) for 2 months now (that is when we met in massachusetts) and we got pregnant together. It is strange to accidentally get pregnant after barely 1 month dating someone. We handled it well (could have been better) and decided to abort.

He did say that in the end its my choice but of course he gave me his opinion on how he thought aborting was a good idea. I too had doubts on having a child while barely just starting to see someone. Well long story short: these last 2 weeks have been rough on the relationship and on my body (i got the abortion done 4 weeks ago). 

The guy ive known for years reaches out to me last sunday, asks how i am and what i am doing, and how is life etc. Well i tell him whats going on and he wants to see me so bad. Not sure what to do. Ive expressed my frustrations with current partner and he seems to be very passive or just not wanting to get hurt (or in denial) about how rough it has been (mostly because it was my body that went through it not his).

Plus, to make matters worst, i had twins and the second one dropped last friday. 27M reached out to me on sunday after 4 years. My current bf (we became exclusive after the pregnancy news) and ""father"" of the children has been feeling very unreachable for the past 2 weeks (i am always texting first and calling him or making plans to see him not vice versa). 

We are supposed to meet up on Tuesday in person. He has been in Boston for the weekend (to meet his fraternity brothers from the past for dinner). He came back tonight and doesnt want to talk on the phone. Maybe video chat tomorrow. I told him about this guy i know for years and how he reached out. He sounded indifferent. Plus, he isnt even here usually. He lives in massachusetts.

He is just back for the holidays and we have only met up once (1 night) since he has, and only because i took a train into the city to see him. His identical twin bro (yes he is a twin!) got covid and had to quarantine at their parents house in long island so for the past week he had to stay in hotels while they quarantined. He has been away since wednesday in boston.

Honestly, i feel like i know the answer to all of this but am super confused about everything! Might be all the blood loss (4 weeks going on 5 and bleeding on and off heavily plus the second baby drops last friday when i go to see him!)

My(27f) boyfriend(30m) and I have had a long and trying year as we both grow after lots of family drama (my side) and us moving apart. We still work on our relationship and I love him whole heartedly but not living together anymore and us both working 50 weeks has done a number on us. He has little to no trust in females due to trauma growing up and past relationships so what trust we have has been hard fought. He's always said that if I cheated it would be a deal breaker and I agreed the same to him. I would never cheat because I saw what it did first hand when I was young and my dad cheated. I think I destroyed his trust tonight.

Let me preface with a little back story. We've always called his member ""Alexander the Great"" or ""Alex"" in reference. For a few months, a couple years ago, he referred to it as Caesar - I think just trying a new name - and we decided it wasn't as good as Alex. 

I just bought a new car Friday, he was with me, and he went in half on the down-payment but today he asked why I was so dressed up to go buy a car. I wasn't really, simple makeup, jeans, boots, and a decent top but nothing at all revealing. Tonight I go over, we get busy and as we lay cuddling and teasing each other, something about children came up. We're child free and I jokingly said ""hold up Caesar, we don't want none of that"". He clams up and i know I fucked it up. We argued and I didn't know what to say because I would never, ever do that to him or anyone. I just don't know why I said the wrong name and I left. 

I don't know what to think or say. I think I'm going to lose him because if he had said another females name in that moment I would've been upset but I know he would never cheat.

It's gotten to the point where I've given up trying to chat someone up spur of the moment. The effort involved in showing an interest only for nothing to happen just isn't worth it.

I currently live at home in NY and have been working at a new job for six months. I'm in the recreation field and I work for a municipality working a pretty decent job. However, in NY (Albany in particular), my field (recreation) is so much smaller than in other parts of the country. Ever since I started in this field, my dreams have been to move out west (Colorado, Utah, Arizona, etc.) to pursue a career in the outdoors. I really love doing it, and it's incredibly fulfilling work. And Albany is just not an area where I can really thrive in the field like I can out west. I've worked a few jobs out there the last few years and I can't see myself ending up anywhere else. I've had lots of conversations with my family (who is bummed to see me want to leave home) and they all support me in my choice to pursue it.

While I know I'm going to move out there at some point, I still don't have a job lined up yet nor many details about what/where I'd actually be doing. Doing some job hunting I've set my sights on Denver as the best spot for me having been there a lot and falling in love with the city. I'll be working this current job for about another 6 months if I can in fact get a decent job and place to live by that time. My boss is super supportive too and has done a lot to help me expand my professional skills in hopes of landing a good job out there. It might be 4 months or 8 months from now, but I don't see myself in NY more than another year max.

So now the issue of this post (sorry for a ton of backstory but I feel it's necessary to understand the context). While I know my goal is to leave NY soon, I still want to continue dating and meeting people until I definitely have a job out there. However, I don't know how to feel knowing I most likely wouldn't be able to keep a relationship more than 5-6 months before having to end it. Yes, I understand long distance is possible, but with the number of things I want to do out there part of me doesn't feel like trying to date while still home is worth it. I don't want to fall for someone (or have someone fall for me) just to know that it wouldn't be truly long-term. I went on a few dates with a girl recently and she basically explained that while things were good, she didn't want to progress with someone who doesn't plan on staying around. It sucks because I feel weird telling girls, I won't be around long term as I feel like that hurts my chances of getting to know someone better until then. Even if it was more of a casual thing, I feel like it can be a turn off even for more casual relationships.

What do you think? Should I still try to meet new women and not tell them I plan on moving? Just be honest and let them know my plans? Just don't bother at all and enjoy my time here with family/friends? I wish it were that simple, but I love to meet new people and foster new relationships so going that long without even trying is tough.

-



She 28 works night shift clinic/catholic school girl/sweet, me 31M

Our date seemed platonic, we met online and had texted prior to meeting for about 2 months due to covid reasons.  Her texting time frame is bad, she will take either a day to respond or 2-3 days.  But certain days we'd talk every few hours apart.

Our first date lasted an hour because of work and it went great, I went for a quick kiss at the end, but she turned and gave me a cheek.  However, she texted me back after a few hours wanting to see me again with heart eyes.

The second date we stayed for 3 hours, all seemed platonic, we played at the arcades, bowling, she tossed me a sexual innuendo regarding how we shared an alcoholic drink, which I only smiled and nod... then we played pool, but she looked frustrated/annoyed (looking at her nails) while we played pool and she said she's tired...  I walked her to her car and she hugged me and left.

I texted her if she made it home safely, and that I had a good time &amp; to see if she had a good time.  She texts me 2 days later saying she was caught up with work and she had a good time and is down for another date.

I scheduled for another date that Saturday, but she told me she works that night but could make it... however, she ends up canceling at the last hour and apologizes.  I told her it's fine, we'll reschedule and she said thanks for being so understanding.  After 5 days had past, I went ahead and scheduled another date, no response, so the next day I wrote something else, no response, the next day I sent a funny pic and mentioned I wasn't feeling all that great on the last date due to cough meds and drinks.. she then finally returns my message and told me she is off next Sunday and she'll be off the entire night.

A few days before the day she said she cares for me and sent me a kissy emoji face and said she will be off the entire night.

We went to play mini-golf, mainly was platonic, not much conversation but cheering each other on, we then played a few games at the arcade and when I said lets hit up the bar, she said ""I'm tired"" and as we walked out I asked how about I come over her place which she had a slight startled look saying ""What? Nooo""... and then I told her but hey, we wanted to watch a movie together (when we were texting before dating) and she said ""yahhh"" so then we changed the subject, walked to her car and she hugged me and left... 

So the next day I told her I had a good time and looking forward to the next.

I explained what I was wanting to do on our past date (2 huge ass paragraphs)

I wrote I hope we can discuss where things went sour. (very stupid accusing something was wrong)

The next day she writes back... saying

""I didn't realize my last message was never sent... I did have a good time with you, but I don't feel in the right headspace for a romantic relationship, I've been stressed the past couple of weeks and I know you deserve someone who will communicate much more regularly than I could. I did enjoy spending time with you, I really did.""

I'm not aggressively looking to get back into dating but am open to it if it were to happen.

Now for some context about the situation, last Friday I went out to meet some friends and there was introduced to the girl in question. We didn't start talking immediately but when we did we hit it off right away. I don't remember the last time I had so much fun talking to someone I just met. We both had a lot of fun and spent pretty much the entire night talking to each other. It was a nice refresher from all the negative stuff that's been happening towards the end of my 2021.

Anyway I'll list some reasons regarding why I think she may or may not be interested romantically.

### Reasons I think she may be interested:

1. There was quite a bit of banter going on that night. I'm not sure if it was flirty or not, but for example she would very frequently touch or ""hit"" my arm when she laughed.
2. My friends would comment on the two of us. This isn't really that big of a sign, but if the more subtle signs themselves weren't there to start with I'm sure my friends wouldn't be making such comments.
3. On Saturday the next day we spent the entire day giving texts back and forth. She would also mention that she felt like she's known me for years even though it's only been a day.

### Reasons I think she may _not_ be interested:

1. That night we hung out with everyone she did say that I'm not her type. From personal experience this usually doesn't mean much (e.g., most of my ex-girlfriends weren't my ""type"" either) but I still don't think it's exactly something you'd say to someone you're romantically interested in.
2. I'm not sure how to put this but it's just really hard to tell for me right now. Granted, it's only been like two days since I've met her but I can't tell if she just thinks of me as a good friend or not. And I kind of feel like the fact that I'm thinking this doesn't seem like a good sign.
3. When I said let's meet up again she was very enthusiastic but kind of just left that up in the air with a ""let's talk again soon"" kind of comment. Again, may or may not be negative given the short amount of time but I'll still add it in.

I guess that's about it but frankly I do think it's a little early to tell.

We're very serious already, and are going to university together. We see each other almost every day, and it's been like this since before we started dating. We go to different schools so we intentionally make plans to spend time with each other. We're also very intentional with our dates - every week we do a special date night, and we regularly take each other on surprise dates. Usually we take turns surprising each other every month, but sometimes we'll do it more often, just for fun. The sex is great. We have so much in common, we go to the gym together, we're studying the same thing at uni, we have a lot of common friends, we share a lot of the same fundamental beliefs and core values. His parents always tell me I'm part of the family and he recently told me they want to take me on a trip. My dad and sister love him, and he genuinely treats my sister like his little sister. He treats me like a queen; he's everything I've ever wanted in a man. I'm so in love with him. We can manage conflict with compassion, and we're good at communicating. We both struggle with mental illnesses so we help each other navigate it. 

There's one thing that I would change though - I miss how it felt at the start; the butterflies and the rush of adrenaline. In my two previous relationships, that initial honeymoon phase lasted longer. We never really had the ""chase"" phase, we both knew we were interested in each other and we went straight to the dating. It was great, I wouldn't change a thing. I just miss the feeling of being excited to see him. Not that I'm not excited now, but it's just become part of my routine. I want to be even more intentional with how I love him, I'm just not sure how to do that. Any ideas?

Add on: my previous boyfriends were abusive (emotionally and sexually), and so my relationships were very stressful and intense. I don't have a lot of good memories from them. Regardless, I felt a lot of butterflies. I'm not sure if those were because of how anxious those relationships made me. All I know is that they didn't feel as mundane as this one.

The first couple of weeks were great, we went on dates, texted every day until one day I started to notice he was getting more infrequent with his responses. I told myself I was overthinking and that he was working nights and had been tired until that weekend he canceled our date because “he felt unwell” and want to reschedule for the next day. The next day we met up and he opened up that he had been struggling with depression and he didn’t feel like himself and this was something he had struggled with in the past. We talked about whether we should pause things and he told me that he wanted to be with me and that he’s glad he opened up to me. The next couple weeks we continued to text, with him mostly initiating, but never him initiating to see me in person or plan a date. We went from seeing each other once a week to once every two weeks, mostly me initiating. This was hard for me because I wanted to see him at least once a week, we live 5 minutes walking distance, and it just felt like he had put no effort into even seeing me. The only thing that maybe made me think he was still interested was that he would reach out and text me daily to say good morning and see how my day has been, but otherwise, there was barely anything in person. We never talk on the phone either. 

Fast forward to yesterday, we had planned (mostly me) to go on a date the next day that would a bit of walking around. He has been working 80 work weeks and I told him multiple times throughout the past week that if he was tired, we didn’t have to do this date. But yesterday he reassured me it sounded fun and he couldn’t wait to see me and I told him I was excited for the date too. Now today, about 2 hours before the date, he texted me saying he was too exhausted to go and that he was sorry, with no plans to reschedule, and then fell asleep for a few hours. 

After he woke up, I asked him to walk over to talk and it ended up with me telling him that I felt like he has given me really no effort the past couple of weeks and that I felt strung along, and that if he wanted to be with me like he said he did, there would be more effort in seeing me. When I asked him if he still had feelings for me, he said he never stopped having feelings for me, but they’re just “locked away right now.” He apologized and said that he’s going through things right now, but never said he’d try to be better or make more effort towards me. Since he didn’t offer to show more effort and to actually make me feel wanted or that he’d fight for me, I just told him I deserved someone who would walk 5 mins to see me, even if it was for a little bit, or someone who could literally show MINIMAL effort to make me feel desired or wanted. That discussion ultimately led to us breaking things off, which sucked, because I clearly still have feelings for him. It’s hard to walk away from someone that you want to be with and care for, but know that they aren’t good for you. 

But now as I lay here and reflect on today, I wonder if I had overreacted? Should I have given him more time? Let him finish up his inpatient duties since that was his busiest time? Should I have waited for him to get into a better place emotionally?

Other guys I’ve dated (1-4 months) have always chosen another girl or they were just trying to use me or had really fucked up pasts that they lied about/hid from me.

My relationship now has honestly been amazing. We get along very well and I’m very involved in his family as I see them both every weekend. During the week when I can’t see him, I become very excited knowing I’ll see him soon on the weekends. For the most part he hasn’t given me any reason to question his loyalty or love for me. However, a few days ago in bed, he said the name of another girls name. I didn’t react at all or even say anything about it, but he became very flustered and even admitted how fucked up it was to hear another woman’s name. I never met her personally, but I do remember him saying how flirty she’s always been. Last year when we first starting dating he invited me to meet her but I had finals to finish and said he should just go see her since she was in town and I couldn’t make it. Something in my gut screamed at me to meet her and I’ve regretted not going ever since.

Outside of that initial worrisome in regards to that girl, he has been a great partner but I still can’t help these doubtful thoughts. Sometimes I question why I’m even with him or wonder when this relationship will end. I’ll just get these dark thoughts saying “This relationship won’t last very long” or “You should break up with him” even though he really hasn’t given me any reason to and I’m very happy with him. I think it is due to the fact my trust and ideas of love has been beaten down and twisted all these years. This is the first time someone has actually loved and cared for me back equal to how I feel for him. But I’m not sure how to go about these thoughts. Am I over thinking?

We met on highschool (15M and 13F when we met, yes the ages make me cringe in retrospect, but we where kids and friends for a long time before I started getting feelings, didn't even kiss at the time) and were just friends but the time developed that into a crush, a weird and crashed crush.

First during highschool in like 2015, she told me she like me and I liked her back, that didn't last because she started feeling lke she was a lesbian so we cut it out.

Like a year later, a friend of hers tried to get us back together since the friend leard that Steph still had feelings for me. This kind of worked since both of us were too incopetent in relationshipa to do anything but just talk and laugh. This lasted a few months and then she started feeling like she was definetly a lesbian and we cut it out.

Bit sad, started joking with my friends that for some reason I feel atracted to lesbians.

Still she and I always wanted to be friends, even after the failed relationships, we still liked to be around each other, so we talked and joked, and greeted each other when we passed each other.

Then life happend, I graduated first since i was 2 years older 
I also got into a broke up with my first girlfriend (long story) and then in 2019 we re met by chance on the line for a astronomy presentation in our city, 19M and 17F at the time.

We started talking again, and god damn it, I liked her again, at this point I was annoyed and scared, I didn't want to loose her as a friend again, I didn't want to be hurt again, but whatever, I told her I liked her anyway, and god damn it she felt the same.

Now this period of like 4 months was happy as shit, we coudn't see each other that often but being together was super fun, I really liked her, but with time she didn't felt the same, she told me she coudn't really develop feelings for me, that she thought that I was great, and still wanted to be friends

And we tried to stay friends, now we talk every few months, if she is doing something to her hair she tells me, or something is happening on her family, I respond to her stories and tell her about my problems.

But I never really could get over her, whenever we talk, the feeling of wanting to be with her for as long as possible and hugging her on sight was still there, and it fucking annoys me.
She is super cool, and I want her to be part of my close circle, invite her to stuff with me and my ftiends, but my brain always goes to the ""maybe this time it could be different"" and it annoys me.

Even now, we talked today, and my brain goes ""its been 
2 years maybe she'll like you again"", like no dude I just want this really dope friend.
