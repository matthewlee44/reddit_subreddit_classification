2,s1xvis,1641963664,Am I overthinking it or she doesn't want anything to do with me?,"So I've been talking to this girl for a week, we know each other from school and started dming on Twitter, after a day of talking there I asked for her number and she gave it to me. I'd say our texts were going fine, I asked her a bit about her plans for the future and then she recommended some shows to me. 

She seemed interested on her dms (the replies weren't one-word texts, and she wanted to know if I had watched what she recommended and if I liked them), but she took so long to reply to some of the messages, some of the times I'd see her post stories or tweets and before getting a reply the day after. The couple days I've thought about not dming her she appeared out of the blue wondering if I had watched x show or movie, and then the same 10 message conversation in a span of 4 hours happened again. 

One day I told her that I was moving to her town, she asked when and like what college I was gonna attend to, after answering her questions I asked her if she wants to go out once I move, she accepted, but since I'm not gonna move until a couple weeks I don't know if she actually wanted to go out or she just replied that to not turn off anything (sounds dumb but I've thought about it). 

We've been in this same cycle of really short conversations that last hours bc of how long we take to respond each other until yesterday when she asked me for some favor and I just left her with the last message, I don't even know if I should expect a double text, if I should be the one to resume, IDK I'm just lost.

Why would you show yourself interested and accept to go out if you're not interested? I just started the convo with her twice.

I have so many doubts, I don't know if she's interested and doesn't wanna look needy, if she's just playing with me / I'm just her back burner or something else.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s1xvis/am_i_overthinking_it_or_she_doesnt_want_anything/
3,s1y660,1641964591,Afraid of the game!,"After 16 years of a brutally committed relationship (the last 3 she got hooked on meth and any guy that wasn't me) and a even more 2 year brutal divorce, I've been debating putting myself back out there.  Most of my time is spent working and taking care of my daughter. 

A few coworkers have suggested online dating. Honestly it scares the shit out of me. Especially some of the things I read on here! I feel like most OLD is for quick hook ups, killing time and hoping antibiotics get rid of it.

What are some ways people meet now that don't involve photo shoots, questionnaires and swiping? 

Somehow I follow r/TwoXChromosones. I see posts and comments frequently that lead me to believe a lot of women have no desire to be approached in public.

4,s1y6to,1641964656,"I (27F) want to message an old Hinge match again after the convo never really happened. We matched a year ago and I haven't been active on the app since then, but I'm back and still want to get to know this person. Too weird/too late?","The guy (29M) responded to one of my Hinge photos *about* a year ago. I had a profile at the time obviously, but wasn't actively using it. Notifications were also turned off. 

Monthsssss later when I logged on and saw it, I matched back with a response to his comment, but then the conversation never took off. No actual talking. His profile hadn't changed at all by that point and I thought it was just stale, maybe? I mean, my response was late. Even at this point, I wasn't really active on the app. I had matches in my queue, but literally zero conversations going.

Fast forward to now, where it's been about a year since I got the original comment on my picture. I feel like I'm ready to actually use the app and actually date. When I log on and see that I still have zero conversations going, Hinge does show that I have one ""hidden"" conversation. It's the conversation with this guy... which again, was never really a conversation. Your match conversations become ""hidden"" after two weeks of inactivity. 

His profile has now been updated with some seemingly new pics since we had that ""match,"" and when I open is profile, I'm still interested in talking and getting to know him. Since we never really talked before and I'd still like to get to know him seeing that he's back on (and it was my fault before for responding soooo late when I wasn't active on the app), my question is this: **I know it's probably a little weird, but is it too painfully odd if I message him to restart the convo and apologize for being super late?** I wouldn't do this if we had some sour or otherwise bad conversation before, but I feel like my timing messed it up and I regret that!

6,s1yd3t,1641965228,In love but can’t be with him,"Maybe someone can help me, I can't talk to any of my family or friends about this. My parents because they wouldn't allow me to talk to him, my best friend isn't an option, and my sisters would either get mad at me or tell my parents. 

This is gonna be long here's your warning 

So let me lay the character 
Person A me 
Person B my sister 
Person C my crush 
Person D my best friend 

Crush and Best friend are siblings 

Crush had a crush on my sister, i’m falling for him which is obvious. 

See why I can't talk to my best friend about it she knows but its not really way talking to your best friends and trying to explain why you think you are in love with their Brother. 

My parents don't approve of him, for either of us to date. And are not fans of their parents. 

I should add that my sister shows no interest in this guy. But I know he has feelings for her. 

I think I could have the 5 seconds of courage and tell him I have feelings for him but I have one problem 

Our age difference 
I’ll be 18 in the next 6 months he's 14
Which makes me sound like a crazy person I'm aware. I’ve fought these feelings for over a year I can't get them to go away. 
I want him to be happy if that's with my sister I'll learn to deal with it, I don't want to lose him if brother-in-law is how he's in my life, he's still in my life. Is it how I want no but I'd rather that than not in my life at all. 

So do I wait for her to break his heart? Or come to realize she doesn't see him like that? 
Do I just go for it? 

I don't think I should. If they still aren't together in 4 years and I still feel this way about him i’m say something but until then I don't think I should. Cause then he knows and there nothing that can be done about it. 

Am I making the right choice? Does anyone have another idea?

7,s1yiww,1641965763,Reminiscing on the worst date of my life: was I setup?,"Last year, I (was 21F) met a guy (26M) on bumble. We went out to dinner and a movie after about 3 weeks of talking. Online he seemed really nice, smart, and ambitious and I also thought he was kinda cute. He seemed like a nerdy guy but I like that sometimes.

When I met him for dinner, he was SO awkward and weird. He didn’t really look the same as his profile. He honestly gave off the vibe that he was really inexperienced with girls in general (and maybe autistic or some kind of mental illness honestly). I regret going to the movie with him after but at the time, I thought “what the heck, it’s a movie.”

We drove separately to the movie theater and when I arrived, I was waiting for a decent amount of time for him to meet me at the front of the theater. To put it in perspective, this movie theater has a huge parking lot in front of it and it has two shopping centers neighboring it. I was waiting and wondering what was taking so long so I called him and asked where he was. He said he was walking up, I saw him, and we went inside. I didn’t think anything of it.

As we were leaving the theater, he walked me to my car and I said goodbye. I was not attracted to him at all and I was not planning on having any sort of physical contact with him. He starts walking away and I asked him where his car was at. He said he parked at the empty neighboring shopping center (probably a good 4 minute walk in the cold at night). I just figured he just was confused about parking when he arrived so I offered him a ride over to the parking lot.

I pull up to his car and I put it in park and he’s just looking at me. Idk if y’all have ever been in an experience like this with an awkward, inexperienced 26yo guy but it was absolutely the cringiest moment of my life (reminder: was not attracted to him at all, kinda felt nauseous tbh). I unlocked the doors and said “goodnight,” he stares some more and goes for it. He started making out with me and I fucking hated it. Literally worst make out of my life and I could taste the Mexican food we had 🤮. I pulled back and he kissed my neck and got up and said “you’re so pretty.” I again said “thanks, have a goodnight.” And he finally got out of my car, got in his car, waved, and I hightailed it out of there.

It kinda traumatized me but taught me a good lesson about REALLY getting to know people before I meet up with them in person. I wish I would’ve FaceTimed him and talked to him before I met up with him but it was Christmas break and I was bored.

Did he purposefully park that far away just so he can corner me like that? I’m feeling kinda restless about the fact that it could’ve ended up being much worse.

12,s1yxar,1641967160,Should I ignore her?,"So, I meet this girl in class. Texted for a bit, I noticed that her text frequency was off (she replies instantly to three days), but she did double reply to my texts and seemed engaged in the conversation. I have a rule, if a girl does not text me back in 24 hours, I automatically drop them, however, my female co-worker convinced me to push further and double text her for dinner, and I got a plan set. 

I noticed that red flags started emerging when I picked her up from the airport (she was out of state for college and my cousin was also leaving in the same airport, which was why I agreed to do it). I literally drove her to a “friend's” house, but she said there was nothing going on. Also, our meeting was earlier than usual, and this was not the same dinner date. While driving her there, we had great chemistry, and I thought we were cool. 

Fast forward to dinner, I picked her, and she said she cuddled with the guy. I asked if there was anything going on, and it seemed that she “likes” him but does not want to commit. She told me, she confessed first but is not ready to settle or make the relationship possible. According to her she “does not know what she wants” and even called it a “red flag”. 

Now, most people with common sense would think “what the actually f\*ck” and try to end things asap. I for some reason continue the dinner like the dumbass I am (she did pay for dinner, so I guess it was okay). She kept asking me if I like someone, and I said yes, I then describe literally her and hid in plain sight. She kept bugging me to tell her who it is. After dinner, she kept wanting me to spill the beans, and when I did, she seemed dumbfounded (which I can’t blame her, tbh). She was very silent, and I even have to ask if this was a rejection, to which she nodded. We agreed to be friends, and she even agreed to get food later, which I thought she was honest about. 

At first, I was a little disappointed, but I felt like I dodged a bullet, as I would not want to be that “friend” that she “likes”. I then texted her about the dinner and decided to invite a mutual friend. She did not respond, and I thought I got ghosted, which annoyed me a little cause I was okay with being friends with her. 

A couple of days later, she texted me “hey, how is it going?” out of the blue. I am unsure about this friendship currently. What do you all think?

15,s1z53b,1641967882,One of the most complicated things about dating is not being able to predict chemistry very well.,"I haven't seen a discussion about this yet, so thought I'd start one since it's been something that I've been thinking about lately. 

When I think about the guy I had the most conversational chemistry with - it was someone I knew almost nothing about prior to the date. I was just like ""fuck it"" on a weeknight. He was in a totally different field of study, from a different state, different racial background, he was a giant (not what I go for normally), and his childhood was totally different too (only child of divorced parents). 

It's just so strange to me that someone I seemed to have so little in common with surprised me by having a very similar conversational style. We both made each other feel so comfortable. We made each other laugh. Just purely pleasant vibes.  It didn't work out for reasons I don't want to get into, but he's one of the few guys I've met online who truly made me feel warm, comfortable, and heard.

But what surprised me is that when I try to filter for guys I might have chemistry with, it never works! I even look for similar educational background, similar ethnicity, similar interests, SAME COLLEGE... the results are just meh. It's like none of that stuff can predict how much fun you'll have with that person or how comfortable it will be to talk to them. 

I almost wish there was a way I could select guys that I would have better chemistry with, but I just think it's impossible. 

Don't even get me started on sexual chemistry, OMG. I'm just willing to take an L on that one if the guy's a good, fun person otherwise.

17,s1zasz,1641968444,I can't tell if this guy is interested in me or not," First off, I was never in a relationship and I have basically no experience flirting. So I (M 19) met this guy (M 18) through a dating app about 12 days ago. Honestly, he's everything I've always looked for. He's attractive, he has my same interests, my same sense of humor, which is very hard to find, especially among gay people.

We talked basically every day since, and the conversations were good. The first doubts came due to his response time though. Sometimes he would answer immediately, but more often than not, after a few texts it would take him 15+ hours to reply, which made it hard to have any meaningful conversations. I even asked him if he was interested in talking cause how long he took to reply and he said ""what? of course I am. If it makes you feel better if I didn't want to talk to you I'd simply not talk to you"", and that he's slow at replying, which makes sense, I guess.

Two days ago my friend advised me that I should tell him that we should play something (since playing videogames is one of the hobbies we have in common). Me being shy and insecure didn't want to, but after being called a p\*ssy for 20 minutes straight I just said f\*ck it and sent the text. He quickly and excitedly replied that yes, we should. When I got on a call with him, I was super scared it would be awkward, but he was super comfortable which made me feel comfortable too, and it ended up being way better than I thought it would be. We played for about an hour and he went to sleep, and told me that we should play tomorrow. I went to sleep super happy that night.

Yesterday, I hit him up saying that we should play something and he said that maybe when he gets home late at night, we didn't talk anymore that day. Then at night, I see that he removed me from his close friends on Instagram which made me extremely anxious and sad, and I spent the entire night overthinking while listening to sad music.

Today, I made a poll in my close friends asking if people wanted to stay in my close friends or be removed, just to see what he would do, and he voted that he wanted to stay. Fast forward to tonight, at about 10 pm, I see that he's online playing, and after getting some courage, I asked him again if he wanted to play (he still hadn't opened or replied to my last text from yesterday). This was 5 hours ago and he still hasn't opened the message.

The entire situation gives me very opposite signals. Sometimes he'll just straight up ignore me and make me feel like he's not interested at all, but then we have really good moments where I feel like ""wow this could actually work"". I don't want to give up on him easily, even if I have to go the extra mile. This is really a one in a million and it's the first time in my life where I feel like I actually found who I was looking for.

I showed him around, we got super close, went on lots of dates, and had a very special connection that I’ve never had before in my life. We met almost every day because we wanted to make the best out of our time together. So obviously I caught feelings and got attached. We both agreed long distance is probably not an option but I was really heartbroken after it. He lives in another country (a 7 hr flight away). I still have feelings for him and think about him a lot. We we stayed in touch and I thought maybe we can stay friends. However, he was making it hard by always flirting with me and crossing boundaries. I had to tell him I started seeing another guy, which I was. He said he was “happy” for me but I can tell it was just pure jealousy. Ever since, we stopped talking. That was two months ago. Fast forward to yesterday, he texted me. He’s back in my country for two weeks but in another city that’s a one hour flight away from mine. Anyhow, he said he misses me, thinks about me a lot, fancies the fuck out of me, and really wants to see me. We had a very long talk and I told him again that I can either be someone’s friend or someone’s gf. I can’t do the in between thing again and hurt myself. I know he will try to kiss me and even sleep with me again. I promised myself I wouldn’t do it again for the sake of my mental health and to protect my heart. He said he still doesn’t want to do long distance but is also admitting that I’m right and he will “struggle” to not kiss me. I don’t know what to do. I’m very happy and excited to see him. However the fact that I may not even be able to hold his hands hurt me. But I’m scared it would hurt more when he leaves again. Would it be so stupid to relive our past? Should I at least give him a kiss goodbye? Will I lose my self respect if I get intimate with him knowing he doesn’t want to commit just because of the distance? Will I get hurt again?

He had expressed that in the beginning of their friendship he “contemplated if he liked her as more than a friend” and decided he doesn’t. His argument why I should feel safe him staying at hers is “do you really think I have a chance” since her sister is his ex, which really rubbed me the wrong way. 

He said he can’t promise her boyfriend would be there, that sleeping at a hotel would be “weird”, that I don’t know their dynamic etc. 

For me it comes down to respect and ever since then, although he is very kind and he seems like everything I’ve wanted in a person, I can’t get this out of my head and I’m slowly starting to lose attraction and see him as just a friend.

36,s21kjo,1641977078,How to deal with mixed signals,"A girl reached out to me through a website and we chatted for a short while on there before switching to WhatsApp relatively soon after. I was on holiday at the time so we messaged for about 2 weeks, but we never had extensive conversations and I felt like I was learning very little about her so I really didn’t know what to expect and was a little nervous before meeting her. 

Anyway, we arranged to go on a date last Saturday night. Not sure if it’s relevant but before the date she wanted me to send her the link to the restaurant I had chosen (it was actually a fairly expensive restaurant) and she asked me to pick her up (even though I don’t have a car and picking her up by taxi meant a longer route for me) - I found that a little strange but I’m not sure if I’m justified to feel like that. 

During the date she was more quiet and reserved than I had expected but overall I felt like she was someone I could connect with and I felt like we enjoyed each other’s company and overall I had a really nice time. During the date I told her how before it I felt like i didn’t know what to expect and she told me she hates texting (she had made a similar comment by text saying it was too long to talk about something by message). 

At the end of the date i dropped her back home and told her I’d like to see her again but that she didn’t have to give me answer then. I don’t really remember her reaction or what she said but it wasn’t clear to me how she felt about it. I texted her when I got home to thank her for the evening and again mentioned about seeing each them soon again if she wanted to - at this stage if she didn’t want to meet again she could have more easily said so because it was no longer in person. 

It’s been 4 days since and we have barely spoken - I understand her dislike of texting but how are we supposed to get to know each other without it? We can’t see each other every day and when I proposed doing something an evening during the week she told me she already had plans. Since she didn’t suggest an alternate date I asked her outright whether she wanted to see each other again and her reply was that she had told me that would be great - either I misheard or she never made it clear. But yesterday I didn’t message her at all because I wanted to see if she would take the initiative and she didn’t. 

I am conscious that, as a person I tend to give back the energy I receive and I am sometimes overly sensitive so if I feel like someone isn’t that interested in me then I quickly stop making an effort. But I’m worried that I read too much into stuff and over think so sometimes I misread certain situations without giving someone the benefit of the doubt. 

I feel like I’m getting mixed signals from her - she could easily say she doesn’t want to meet again by text if that were the case but instead told me she does. On the other hand, she has shown very little or no interest in talking (by text) since our date. English is not her native language but she speaks it very well so I don’t think that can be the issue either.

38,s21s4a,1641977909,Relationship failing or am I overthinking?,"Hello internet romantics I'm in a delima of sorts...

 I believe my newly formed relationship( just over 1 month) is starting to fail and that my partner is no longer interested in me. 

Some backstory: she's a mother and goes to school full time. We've known each other for a while as we used to work together but didn't really talk for a while until a few months ago. We really kicked it off and have gone on several dates. We've blew past all the bases and she introduced me to her child( who I think is such an awesome kid thanks to her mom). 

A week ago I did something dumb to which upset her quite a  bit ( nothing extreme like cheating in any form or being disrespectful to her child, but rather not get into finer details) and didn't talk to me for a few days. When I finally was able to get her to talk(about 5 days after the fact with minimal communication from me to give her space and time to cool off). She said she was upset about the situation and that she also was upset about pda( booty grabbing not kissing) infront of her kid and in public and that it was a major turn off for her and she felt embarrassed because people were looking( never noticed people taking that much notice and she never told me her discomfort up til this point). She said she wants to really slow things down....

 We started out texting back and forth to what was probably 30-40 times a day... now I'm lucky to get 5 responses out of her a day. She used to call me babe in our messages all the time... now I just get this(...) in between sentences. I ask to call her a few days ago so I can hear her voice she declines saying she just got over a cold and doesn't really wanna talk. She is starting to workout again so I asked if I  Can join her on a session or two on my days off and she told me no she uses her workout sessions as ""me time"".

 I work early afternoon in to late night so where as her schedule has her busy from the morning until the time I start work so I barely can see her when I can.  She claims that school and her duties as a mom have really eating   up her time alot lately which is perfectly understandable( I really don't require all that much attention personally and I completely belive in the value of ""me time"". Plus I never expect for me to become a priority over school let alone her own child)but it just seems like I'm barely a thought in her mind anymore. She still sends me good night and good morning texts which I really do appreciate but it also kinda comes off as just a way to keep me on the line. Idk what happned but when that negative situation happned it feels like I got thrown out side and had the doors slammed shut on me. Things were very much smooth sailing until then. To be fair we did start dating right around her finals and all other weeks were during her winter break until now so maybe it is just what she says it is. She has been telling me how stressful school has been right out the gate with this new semester.... maybe I'm just desperately searching for justification.

 Idk folks I'm in need of some input big time. I just need to know if these are the signs that the end is nigh or  if I'm just being a anxiety ridden mess.

It is something that I want in my life, but in the abstract way, like when you kinda want to be an astronaut as a kid, cool if it did happen but you’ll be fine if it doesn’t. Anyways, I’d like to have a long term boyfriend, I’d like to have that level of closeness and companionship, but it’s hard to meet people I share a mutual attraction with. I’m very slightly on the autism spectrum and it has sort of manifested in this ambivalence about relationships, “it’d be nice, but it’s not worth the effort to try”.  I have very close friends that assure I’m never lonely and my libido has been halved thanks to good ole anxiety medication so I’m not exactly chomping at the bit to get into a relationship. But I’m worried that one day all of my friends will enter relationships, that I’ll be left alone, that I’m somehow immature or underdeveloped because I just never got off my damn ass and actually looked for a relationship. 


Furthermore I have not had very positive romantic influences in my life. Everyone in my family has been divorced at least one. We are prone to getting into toxic/abusive relationships, my own sister has dated several narcissists. I cannot for the life of me think of a single healthy romantic relationship I have witnessed beyond fiction. 


I want to love and be loved, I want someone who I trust and can talk to, I want someone who I feel completes me (even though I don’t feel incomplete as is) but for a variety of reasons this just seems unrealistic? Every relationship I’ve personally seen has resulted in abuse, discontent, hatred. 


I don’t want to seem pessimistic, I’m really not. I love people, I have met some fantastic people! I don’t think everyone is evil and that every relationship is doomed. It just feels like a welcome but unnecessary part of life. And yet I am being made to feel (in a sort of grand scheme of society way) like I am missing out on something integral to the human experience. 


I’m not even having casual sex. I don’t really enjoy sex much unless it’s with a trusted person.


I would love if I met someone that I just clicked with. I don’t really want to go out of my way to look for that, but if it happened that’d be nice. I’m just not sure how to approach my own attitude?

59,s25vhi,1641992879,Why the need to be impressed or wanting the other to be special at something that won't effect you?,"I started talking to a girl on twitter dms (my intention for a possible dating), as we are getting to know each other (been following each other for two years), I mentioned why I vistied a country because I particptaed in a tournament and she replied with ""I'm impressed"". Later, we talked about our interests and I mentioned drwaing and she replied with ""I'm impressed .. I admire artists"". Keep in mind that I had no intentions to impress as this was part of the topic. In another day she asked what's my curretn goals, my answer was generic ""continou to stay fit, save money and learn new skill"". 

I asked myself if have I not mentioned any of the above, would she still be interested in me? Was that some of her requirments to be intersted in a guy? 

Btw, she said she dosen't have any special interest like drawing or playing instrument, and dosen't have any current goals. I'm fine with that and dosen't bother me or a turn me off, since it's an individual thing that won't affet us if we are in arelationship. Her playing fluent for example won't impress me and won't add anything to our relationship since it's just a hobby, however playing video games will be a plus (she does) because it's something we can do together but not a requiremnet.

I'm always excited when I click with a girl that is easy to talk to, have similr interest (we do), similar senser of humor (to be discoverd) and similar outlook in life (we do). Pretty simple universal stamdards for any relationship.

I would understand if a girl want a guy to play an insturment so they can play together, but if it's just him playing alone in a room, then how would that make him an interesting person? it's the same as when he was single

Source? Reddit posts and real life experience

I understand that size and shape matters, the feelings are different. There are a lot of things men can change to make themselves more attractive, but nothing can be done about penis size. HOWEVER, women CAN, for example, do kegel exercises to tighten their pelvic floor and therefore feel more when having penetrative sex. Also, I would NEVER choose to not date someone due to how tight or loose their vagina is.

Why isn't this talked about more? Perhaps so many women that enjoy only above average or huge penises would be able to equally enjoy an average or below average penis if they resorted to kegel exercises

I say this because I've seen so many reddit posts about women wanting to only date men with big penises, or ending their relationships due to penis size insatisfaction.

65,s2752a,1641996587,I'm on the fence about a situation regarding a girl I recently met. Is she not interested or am I overthinking this one?,"I met a girl recently at a party. She was showing clear interest in me by asking me a lot of questions, hovering around me, sharing info about her life, touching me etc. I took all the signals and asked for her number. Then I asked her out a few days later and she says yes. We went on the first date for a walk in the city (thanks to lockdown) and our walk was cut short because it was too cold outside and she was basically freezing. She wanted to go home but also said that she wants to meet again. The next day, I text her that it was nice to see her and I'd like to see her again and she says she wants to see me too. All is good so far. (Side note, she told me on our walk that she had a bit too much to drink at the party and she doesn't remember a lot from that night)

Problem is, we don't text a lot and that's completely okay. I have a busy life and I assume she does too. But I tried to initiate conversation and she responded but then she doesn't say anything that will carry the conversation. So last time I texted her was on the weekend, and the conversation went dry after two back and forth texts. I'm not a needy dude so I'm not texting over and over. To be clear, I don't want us to text all day but I need some sort of indication that there is interest from her side too.

Usually, this is where I would tell someone that I'm not feeling the spark I felt when we first met so it's better not to go on a second date. I haven't texted her in days and she also hasn't said something so part of me thinks, well she's not interested in you. But there's a part of me that thinks that you two don't know each other well right now so maybe that's why she isn't that engaged, if you go on another date, maybe it'll get better.

66,s279b9,1641996869,Ok some advice to the ppl who are broken rn,"
Ok fellas, most of you are sad rn, i can totally understand that, which is fine, but again. Question yourself, is it worth it, crying, Pleading for them to come back? I can tell, most of you are in your 20s and thinking it's the end of life. Nope totally not. You're not even 50 yet. You got alot of time in your life. You see, most of us that are grieving rn we put relationship as if it's a priority in life, and when it fails, it hurts like hell, it's because, the only thing we put so much efforts, time, money and energy, for the 1st time and it all went down to hell. That's what the problem is, we can't accept the fact that we got rejected. Our ego comes in, ""how can she/he leave someone like me, after giving so much to them"" that's what your 1st response is, i can bet when your ex ended things. There's a point where you mentioned ""how can you do this to me after doing so much for you"" that's the ego, and after the ego, here comes the anger, you might act like a total asshole in anger to your partner, and then comes the part where you finally accept the fact your partner left you. 

#loss and gains

Well you see my fellas, even if this breakup hurts, look at the positive side, you only lost someone who was never meant to be with you, but they lost someone who loved them unconditionally, it's a rare thing in this sad word.
Be happy, now you can put your values in a higher position and make your standards high. You can only attract quality people in your life by building your life better. Work on your carrier, meet great people, make friends, get success. Once you get successful in your life, looking back you will be thanking yourself, and this feeling you have rn ""i want her to realized what she lost"" will just vanish and you will be like""meh idc"" because you will be sitting on a throne of your success. 


#things you don't have to do

Like i said before, don't treat your relationship like it's the only thing you got in your life. Never do that. Most of us, fight, get worried, in the future as if, ""what if she/he finds someone who is better than me""
Don't do that. For the right person, you will never to fight, wanna know why? The right one never leaves. Also never change yourself for someone, do not do that. You have been developing your personality for like what 20 years now?. Is it worth it to change yourself for someone who's been with you for like a year? Or best case scenario 5 years? If they can't accept yourself for who you are with your flaws, you don't need someone like them. Back tf out of that kind of relationship where your partner complains about how you need to change this and that, it's ok to get rid of your bad habits but the good ones nope. Also remember there's always a pretty girl or a handsome guy with a character and quality, never worry about that. After all, if gem was that easy to find, everyone would have it. Make some morals in life, and live by them. 


#the problem

I can tell, most of you are crying rn, sad very sad. In fact some of you are depressed, ask yourself just why? Is it because you cared about that person so much and yet they did not choose you? Stop blaming them and yourself for not working out. Quit being sad and crying over temporary person. Do you know whom you should be crying and worried about rn? Your parents. Your mom, would have never wanted her child to cry for someone, she did not raise you for this. You can do better. It's just a person, you will get someone better. Focus on yourself. Stay single for a while. Spend time with your parents while you can. Because time takes it all away. I remember, I used to ignore my mom's call, while being on call with my ex, no it wasn't the good talks, it was me begging her to stay while she abused me with her words.
I deeply regret that, now i always spend weekend with my parents. And I'm very happy with that.



#the solution

If your relationship ended because your ex cheated on you, and at some point they come back. Never take them back. It's just not worth it. Even if you do, it will not be the same, and after a month or so, you will regret your action. The main goal here is, you need time, and disappear from their life. Even if they call, text, don't even bother to respond. 
I was that one guy who would cry every night, and stand all day in front of her college, just to have a glimpse of her, but now after all this time I have realised, it's not worth it at all. You see, i went from that one guy being on the top of her chat list to be on the block list.
Looking back, it only makes me laugh how stupid i was for crying over a girl. It's just a girl lol. Now, also looking back i realised how abusive she was to me emotionally and verbally. I don't even feel like talking to her anymore. Even if at my lowest, whenever i wanted to reach out to her, i get this feeling rushing into me ""not worth it""
I don't even feel like watching her socials. Now it only cringe me even hearing their name.
List down all the red flags you missed and the things your partner made your life miserable for you.
And the next time you feel like talking to them. Just read those list instead. 
But hey, you wanna reach out anyhow? Sure go ahead but always remember, you will end up hurt. 



I can tell, things do get better. Always does. 
It's always about acceptance and forgiveness.
Build yourself like a king, if you want to make sure they regret loosing you.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s279b9/ok_some_advice_to_the_ppl_who_are_broken_rn/

72,s286m2,1641999412,Actually met someone not from Tinder,"So recently I've (24F) re-entered the dating scene after a three year relationship. I've been on and off of Tinder, with mixed results but ultimately nothing yet. Fast forward to this previous Monday and I end up going out to a couple bars with several of my coworkers. We're all in law enforcement so our social circles largely comprise of just each other. After a while one of them invites us over to his house since the place we were at was closing early.

All of us were under the impression that he still lived with (yet another) one of our coworkers so when we get there, to my pleasant surprise this attractive guy comes into the kitchen with us and- turns out he's the new roommate. I was solidly drunk at this point and with absolutely no shame I told my buddy that his roommate was cute. He just kind of laughs at me and says, ""Really? He said the same thing about you.""

Normally, I'm fairly reserved and not really flirty but hey, liquid courage. In the end, we spent an hour or so chatting it up, heavily flirting, some of the other guys do the whole nudge nudge wink wink thing at him. I ended up waking up in his bed after a uh, fun night. He had to jet off to work because he wound up being an hour late (oops). I made it home later and sent a message to my coworker telling him that I apologize to his roommate for being so drunk, more of a test to see if I can maybe find a way to get the guy's contact info. Immediate response? ""He wants your number...""

Success lol. We texted back and forth all day, I guess we'll see if this goes anywhere. This is the first time in quite a while I've met someone like that *not* from a dating app.

Fast forward she comes to the USA to work a bit. Which keeps her busy af. I fly across the country to see her. It was one day barely just went out shopping (on her dime) breakfast and a movie. She did not stay with me after an invite. 
      After this zero communication. Normally I’d say fuck it. But I put a lot of effort into this. So after some time we communicate. She calls me right before I was about to have a delicious dinner in Madrid. Tells me she got on tinder. Hooked up with a another America. Guy and he knocked her up. He of course ghosted her and she had to find an abortion pill on her own. At 20 years old. 
   Now this convo ruined my appetite. Because I felt bad for her and also for myself. Here I am a decent guy treating her very well and she goes and fucks some douche bag and gets knocked up!

        At this point I should be done with her. Plenty fish in the sea. Yet here I am at the airport. Instead of flying to miami as planned this morning I just dropped a couple grand and I’m flying to her. She has absolutely zero time (I mean I did give last minute notice) and if I’m lucky I’ll give her a ride home from work tonight. Chit chat. Maybe make a nice gift of flowers or some shit and that’s it. The next day I’ll hop on a plane and get back on track.

We just kept talking and then we met up again for the fourth time to ice skate again, this time we were more closer in person than we were previously.

He also told my friend that the reason why he didn't wanna initiate a lot with me was because he also didn't wanted to hurt/play with my feelings (concern about me) so rn he's like evaluating his feelings. Somehow, I just feel like I should make him stop liking me because there wouldn't be a point since I'm not his type, but we both like each other and I'm kinda lost rn... I'm meeting up with him and my other friends again this Saturday, should I avoid him? I'm rlly clueless when it comes to all these...

80,s29qna,1642003405,Break up advice please,"**Background info**\- I (22M) am a senior college (with one year left for masters) and have had a pretty tough past 5 years. My mom got diagnosed with terminal cancer 5 years ago and has about 6 months left, My father passed away 3 years ago, and my twin brother has been going through suicidal and psychosis episodes. I've been dealing with major depression but I believe I've done a good job managing it. I met this girl (22F) this past summer at a restaurant job we both had in our college town. She also suffers with depression and mood distorted (but is medicated). Her previous boyfriend 2 years ago was physically abusive and she has a lot of repressed trauma that she hasn't unpacked yet. We started hooking up during the summer and slowly became more serious throughout the first semester. She asked me to be exclusive about 3 months ago. Everything was going well her friends liked me and vise versa, we were going on lots of dates, I met her dad, and she came to my hometown to visit me when I was home for family issues, we were having great sex and were there for each other emotionally. 1.5 months ago she got a job 2hr away and knew she was going to probably move up there. My biggest worry was that she didn't know what she was signing up for given all the family shit I have going on but she constantly reassured me she didn't care and wanted to sign up for it anyway.

**Dating**\- Come New Years eve and I thought we had a very healthy progression in the talking stage and I had no doubt she wanted to date given she asked being exclusive, she expressed feelings for me, and I felt the same. I asked her to be my girlfriend the 31st. We were both genially ecstatic about it. First 10 days of the relationship went there was no fighting and I thought all was well.

**Break up**\- 2 days ago I got a text from her saying, *"" i know this is not something to text but i have a lot of anxiety and trauma tied to conversations like this, so im more than happy to talk later i just had to start this conversation with a text. part of my stress the last few days has been that i've realized i'm just really not in the mental space to be in a relationship. it's been really hard to process that cause i care about you a lot but i think there's just way too much happening in my life right now i'm extremely overwhelmed and anxious"".*

We were supposed to talk in person last night. She got attacked by her ex when she tried ending things with him and has a lot of trauma related to that so she wasn't able to talk in person so we talked over the phone. I was upset about that at first but given circumstances I understand. She said she needs to unpack this trauma with serious help and can't have a boyfriend during it cause she needs to making every decision for herself. She said the logistics wouldn't work given she's moving and wants to meet new friends, explore the city, and wouldn't want to drive 2hr away on Friday just to go back Sunday and that I couldn't visit her because of my dog(stick landlord). I believe that those are excuses and if she genuinely liked me she would be willing to make sacrifices. She told me she didn't expect me to ask her out! I asked her if this is something we're going to keep to the door open for when we're in a better place.She told me no and that she didn't love me and couldn't see us getting married and that she is going through a big transition point in her life and has had a boyfriend every big transition and can't this time cause she needs to making every decision for herself. I asked why didn't she think about this before in the months of talking stage when we were getting more serious to which she didn't have an answer to. She said she did have genuine feelings for me and it wasn't fake.She told me she wants to continue to be there for me and support me. I told her that I can't maintain a friendship with someone I have feelings for and I can't continue to talk to her. (trying to set healthy bounds for myself)

**Conclusion**\- At the end of the day I want what's best for her and if that's not being in a relationship then so be it. I don't wanna date someone who doesn't want to. She hasn't healed from her trauma and I should've saw that as a red flag. It's better for her to realize this now rather than down the road when I'm more emotionally invested. Communication would've been awful if she can't talk about anything deemed negative in person. Is she lying to herself about not expecting me to ask her out to make herself feel better about ending things? Did she have genuine feelings for me and was this was all realizations she had now or was she getting the most out of me while she was here? This all came out of nowhere I can't help but feel played.

She doesn't do much outside of work so I feel like she became dependant very quick, something I thought wouldn't really happen because of her age so I didn't pay much attention (stuff like ""why did you leave me on read?"" Etc while I'm just busy with work and maybe leave my phone for like 10 mins) she mentioned her past trauma etc which I won't repeat on here but, I don't want to be a therapist so I ended up cutting it off. Biggest red flag for me was that, although I do acknowledge she went through a lot of stuff, she victim blames herself a lot, so she doesn't have any friends etc despite her not even making an effort to do so, she just rants a lot. Honest to god at first glance looking at her you would never get vibes like that off her as she is quite easy going at first and imo very attractive but yeah, just feels like I'm getting energy sucked out of me, she started speaking over me quite a bit recently on phone calls and I just stared at my phone once like wtf am I doing, I know so much about her but it's not even the same the other way round. I'll stick with people round my age moving forward, I read a lot of you had a good experience which I'm happy for but I just don't want to risk it moving on, I already have a hard time reading people so I don't wanna get another headache, if it wasn't for this sub I probably would have stayed with her for a lot longer though so thank you guys, even the people that were for it/encouraged me to try anyways it was very relatable so it made the process a lot easier for me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s29wcd/update_post_would_it_be_weird_to_have_a_5_year/

85,s2a90e,1642004719,Advice?,"Hi so I’m a 22F and I met this 23M on bumble a few months ago. We talked a lot, had a few FaceTime dates, and i really liked him. He is so sweet, he always asks to watch shows together, bought me a birthday gift, tries to teach me new things, etc. 

Well when we were in the middle of talking I went MIA for a few weeks because my grandpa passed away and I was very sad (still am) about his passing. While I was MIA we began following each other on Instagram and began talking again, but I could sense it wasn’t the same. He told me he ended up moving to New York (we’re both from SoCal) and was living there for a year because of work. 

Each day our conversations are shorter and shorter and some days we hardly talk at all. I feel bad because I’m afraid I hurt my chances with him by not telling him I needed some space to grieve my grandpa (idk why I didn’t feel comfortable telling him at the time) and to add him moving far away put even more of a strain on us getting to know each other in person I feel. 

He still replies to my stories whenever I post a pic and tries to initiate a conversation, but he’s just so hot and cold sometimes. Which sucks because then I feel that he’s not interested and I begin to detach myself. 

I really like him and I want something more. Should I just tell him how I feel and explain why I went MIA, maybe that’ll help restore our connection ? Or is he just not into me anymore ?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s2a90e/advice/

87,s2aiq3,1642005413,Where do you draw the line on guy friends?,"
If you’re dating a girl exclusively, where do you draw the line on her having guy friends? 

Should she not have any at all? How would you feel if your girlfriend made plans with another guy but didn’t invite you/other people? What if she’s insistent that they’re only friends and does not ever see them any other way? Would you allow this or give an ultimatum? Everyone needs a social life, but it doesn’t seem wise to allow a guy on girl friendship to bud into something else behind your back. 


I feel like any guy trying to hang out with a girl sees at least some glimmer of a romantic relationship in the works. Even if “they’re just friends” in the back of his head and probably her head is the fact they could get sexual if they wanted and the right opportunity presented itself. That being said I would consider a girl putting a lot of effort into a friendship like this can almost be considered dating as if she’s testing the waters with someone else so she can be exclusive with them instead.


Does this seem incredibly jealous and controlling? Or is this rational thinking? 

Thinking back to my community growing up, I can’t think of a single couple that would allow their spouse to spend time with the opposite sex alone. It’d be entirely unkosher regardless of context. No one would say that’s controlling or jealous, it’s just not being stupid and doing what’s right for the person you care about and your relationship with them.

88,s2am9o,1642005667,Women's opinion on men wearing graphic T-shirts,"Hey, everyone

My question here is pretty simple. I saw on some subreddits and on Youtube videos that for a man to look good, graphic T-shirts are a huge no-no because they're considered immature and not serious.

I (23M) collect band T-shirts. I love music and I love showing what I love. The design on these varies from just a simple logo to really elaborate drawings and graphics.

While I understand this is not the type of thing one should wear to a fancy dinner or on formal work occasions, band T-shirts will be my casual wardrobe for 99% of my social outings. I don't expect this to change if I get a girlfriend, if we were to, say, go grab an ice cream or go to the movies, that's what I'd wear.

I know it sounds a bit silly to ask but is it as big of a deal as the Youtube videos and subreddits made it sound?

She used to be in a relationship up until some point last year. I asked a mutual friend if she was still in that relationship and he said that she had broken up with her previous boyfriend, but he said he wasn’t sure if they got back together, or what.

I didn’t want to ask her directly so as not to show too much interest too soon, so I decided that I’d just start flirting with her, and back off if she mentioned the dude at some point, or if she just didn’t seem interested.

We’ve quite clearly been flirting via text, even though we’ve spent most of the time about 800 km apart.
