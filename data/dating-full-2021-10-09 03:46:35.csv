I (19F) have been in a very happy relationship with my bf (19M) for 6 months. However time to time I think about having casual hookups with random guys. We go to uni together so hookups are pretty normal. I honestly dont know why I think about this sometimes. We dont have penetrative sex rn in our relationship but will definitely in the future. Still we both can finish when having sex so thats not an issue (I am satisfied). 

It also is the case that I am definitely more attractive than him, not to the extent where its something I would ever mention but tbh initially when we started dating I didnt find him that attractive. Now I definitely find him attractive and he turns me on, but his personality and our past helps that a lot I think.

I love my bf so much and I could see us together for a very long time. Idk if its because there’s still a lot of things we dont do yet in our sex life or the idea that I could get a really hot guy/girl for one night of meaningless sex but I think about it time to time.

We went to have a couple beers at a pretty lively bar in the centre of our city’s night life. Conversation flowed pretty easily, and so this casual type of “date” went well. 

A few pints of beer turned into a couple more, all the while the bar kept giving us free shots. I handle beer like a champ, but i’m terrible with spirits. 

we both got really tipsy and decided we’d go to his place to sleep. Originally i was supposed to take a bus to go to my place outside the city, but busses had stopped driving already as it was really late.

He ended up initiating intimacy early in the morning, and i was originally on board until he started fingering me. The entrance to my vagina was hurting. Really, really hurting. When i mentioned this, he stopped and ended up cuddling me close. 

When i was fully awake in the morning, he mentioned to me that we were both really drunk last night. I’d apparently vomited and everything. He was really embarrassed, and revealed that we had sex.

We talked a lot in break time and she even shared a video which made her cry when she watched it before. The 2nd time (this was 2 days in a row) she gave me boba for the ride before and i told her if she wanted i could give her a ride back home again, little hesitant at first but agreed when we got out comfortably. We talked a lot in the car with what she loves and hobbies and stuff but i kind of noticed i kept asking the questions and she never asked me about something or anything. Then when she got home i said if she had any social media and she said no(i feel like i saw her instagram on her phone when i glanced a bit when she showed me the video) and i just said if i could ask for her number.

I am posting on this forum to get some perspective and support. 

I apologize for the length, but I spent a long time working through a lot of trauma and issues. Life is a journey. This is my story. 


The issue at hand:

I used to feel like there are are unspoken complexes that exists in the gay community. Come to find out, straight dating is the same way. I will explain what I’m talking about in a second. 


About me:

For a little back story, I am a 29 year normal guy. I like to think I’m perceived as decent looking. The only downside I will say is that I stopped growing in high school and I’m short (5’4”) and have a medium to slim body type that’s on the cusp of dad bod. I’ve been called an otter before to give you a good idea. 


My goals:

I’m looking to get back out and start dating again seriously and looking to get married to a guy and start a family. In the past, this expectation has scared away every guy that has been interested in me. 


My self discovery journey:

I have done a lot of self discovery and found out I have had an unhealthy attachment to a fairytale-like relationship. This led to what therapists call love addiction. I know these ideals and expectations were something I was conditioned to believe in from my parents. 

After many toxic/failed relationships later in life, I wanted so bad to fall in love that I would fall in love with men that resulted in being dumped repeatedly. I developed bad habits like prematurely falling in love with men only to find out they were not available the way I wanted. 

I have also been the type to prematurely to fall in love with a guy right away before even knowing if this person was right for me or had my best intentions in mind. I was addicted to the highs of knowing someone liked me back and I attracted them. 

I have recently made these connections and have been trying to find my triggers and trying to undo the expectations I have been wired to believe. 

I know it’s a long road to recovery but I feel like I have made so much progress in life I never thought I would be. There’s some things I need to work on that doesn’t have to deal with relationships, but enough is enough: I’m ready to find a husband. I still desire that and feel like I deserve to be happy with someone. 

I know it’s not going to happen like a fairy tale, but all I ever asked for was to be attracted to a guy and for there to be chemistry and intimate love making. 

As I am turning 30, I try to practice self love and getting into things I love and hobbies so I’m not obsessing about having a husband. I used to hold on to close friend and never wanted them to move on. That was always my biggest fear. 

But as I got older, I have come to the conclusion that friends and even guys come in seasons for me. There are good and bad seasons. I have come to peace that I have to be self sufficient and not be so codependent. 


About my dating history:

I have had one long term boyfriend. It was a very intense first love. Kinda like the ones you read about. He has been the closest I have come to having a soul mate. We were together for 2 years and I didn’t know how to communicate to him. I felt like he always invalidated my feelings and dismissed them. It eventually led to us breaking up. 


After that, I met guys mainly through Grindr with my premature love attachment. Can you imagine how that turned out for me? Disaster. 

The only perk during that time was how I felt so desirable and the only take away was that I at least got sex out of it. Every relationship ended with them dumping me, me discovering how unavailable they really were, or discovering that they were having some attachment to someone else and leading me on. 

To me I was hoping that each hookup would turn into a steady boyfriend and then husband. It began turning into a sort of emotional roadmap. To me, I definitely don’t feel like I ever came across as too desperate. But I will say I was always the one to make the first move and ask the other person out. It irritates me because I never got asked out. 

Occasionally, I would even get some of the guys to proclaim that we were dating. I’m afraid a good majority of them probably did not see to that way. I was just some guy they were fucking with to pass time until they moved on to someone else. This leads me to believe and wonder how many people have that kind of mindset and how they can live with themselves. 

The odd part was the worst guys with the worst complexes were the ones who were the most adored. To many, it came across as a false sense of confidence. I’m sure they thought, “I’m so desirable that I can lead someone on and lead him on.” They were a bunch of jackasses to me. No empathy or remorse whatsoever. 

If I can explain another complex example I was dealing with, Imagine that I am at work talking to a coworker in another department I like. I’ve been pining for him trying to drop subtle clues I’m interested for a little while . 

He doesn’t ignore my advances. He stares back at me and I have repeatedly checked him out with him watching, made eye contact and smiled at him invitingly. I keep hoping he makes the first move since when I shoot my shot, I always get turned down. 

Another gay man walks in and the guy I just laid all the groundwork on completely turns his attention away from me in a single second and fawns over this other guy that just walked in flirting with him. 

This other guy isn’t necessarily better looking than me. The guy that just walked in also isn’t even trying to win over the guy I like. But he is the one that was able to win over my crush in a single second even though he hasn’t made an attempt to stop me.  

This is the tip of the iceberg of what I have experienced trying to flirt and trying not come on too strong with guys considering my experience and life journey

But I'm not saying that at all.

But what I am saying, or asking, is does anyone else automatically disqualify themselves from the running when they see this? For context, the X in the headline is usually a number like 23 or higher. Don't get me wrong, I love travel. I've been all over the US and been to a handful of countries. But also, most of that was when I was younger. I'm 39 now and my life's situation has changed. I just don't have the resources, but most importantly, the time, to travel the world. Although if I won the lotto doing just that would be at the top of my list.

So when I see this on profiles, it *could* just be something she is including as a fun fact about herself, in which case, yes, that's awesome. I love that. But really I'm assuming you're looking for a partner to grow that number with and unfortunately for me, I'm not going to be someone you can do that with at the pace you are probably looking to do it. So I assume you're using it as a bit of a filter to filter people like me out, and it works. Now if you want to fly from Boston to San Francisco for 5 days for the sole reason of going to the Tame Impala concert like I did last month, I'm your guy. But if you want to travel to Greece, go on an African safari, and scuba dive in Belize in the next 10 months, I just can't help you and I always swipe right on your profile, no matter how attracted I am to you and how much of a match we might seem to be otherwise.

I’ve been trying to go out but I have no real sex appeal. I dress well, I smell great, my hair is the best style I can get for my hair type and hair line. I try to talk to women when I go out but I honestly just don’t get anything. No looks, no smiles, no indications. I just stand at the bar and try to talk to someone who stands next to me and make small talk but it doesn’t seem like anyone really reciprocates. 

My ex on the other hand is hooking up with multiple people. Having the time of her life. I’m pretty much a distant memory in her mind but in my mind she’s the last person I had sex with and the last person that physically touched me. 

I’m feeling like I’m failing. Even though I have my life together and have good things going for me. But socially I’m just not there and it feels like it’s getting worse with age. I know guys who are getting laid and they literally have no jobs, no goals and no ambition but they know how to talk to women and create sexual tension I guess because they have no problems pulling even though they live with 4 other dudes ina literal dump, trust me, I’ve been over their place. 

I just don’t get it. I feel like there is something wrong with me. I’m either too boring, not attractive or something in between because it seems everyone from the bum on the street to my ex is just happily going out and having fun and having an active sex life and I’m going out twice a week to bars, Tricia, music nights and I literally leave without even talking to anyone sometimes. 

I don’t want to down spiral but it’s really hard to enjoy life when you do so many things alone and even in my meetup groups I know ppl are hooking up but I still am just a friend to everyone. Idk what else to do because a part of me is slowly starting to become bitter at everyone around me getting laid and being fun while I’m on the sideline.

We both said that we never met someone like us, she liked me etc. Everything was great because of one thing - i have a very clingy behaviour, (ever since my mother died, fear of abandonment) and I tried to hide it as best i could. In the end it showed, but she was still really into me.

3 days ago, we were supposed to meet and she had to cancel because she said that its been too much of her sonm and his behaviour changed.

That day i was drikning and the fear of abandonment triggered when i saw that, I just wanted to cancel everything. I said I wanted to meet up and pick up my stuff, she said lets talk when you are sober. I went there anyway in the midldle of the night, and while i was on my way she said ""this is scary and very weird"" ""its not ok"" I still went there because I was drunk. When i got there i told her all about my clinginess and how its because of my mothers death. She said she wanted to sleep and if i could go home, i sitll didnt go home, and she had to tell me for 1h, and i still refused to leave, because i was really drunk and regret my descision. She said its the worst thing she ever experienced, first i come uninvited, then i refuse to leave. i started crying and got rly emotionally. IN THE END, her brother comes, and helps me get a cab, and i go home.

while i go home, i sent her a text to aplogize, she said

""Im so sad that it happend this way, but i think its best for us both. You are a great guy and I wish you the best, hug""

We use to work together at the same community college and we currently go to the same church. We don't talk much but when we do I usually am the one who starts conversation not in a flirty way but in a friendly way because she's a familiar face I used to work with and we go to the same church.  Anyway most my interactions with her from back when she worked at the college have always been a bit stuck up towards me. This was before I really developed a very strong crush on her which happened over the last year. 
I don't think there will ever be a chance for us to even be friends.

 She's so hot and cold with me which has been going on for a year now. One day she's nice, friendly and talkative with me then other days she stuck up. She turns her back to me while I'm trying to have normal conversation with her that doesn't involve me trying to put the moves on her. I've never once have made and romantic advances towards her. It's all been genuine friendly friendship conversation. Because I want to get to know her first as a person and then maybe develop an actual friendship with her.

 But I highly doubt that will ever happen between us. I've asked her two different times.""Why does she act so passive aggressive towards me whenever I'm around what's the issue?"" She told me both times there isn't an issue. Now I'm not fan of the he said she said stuff but multiple people have told me that's how is. One day she nice and friendly then other days she'll walk right pass you like she doesn't know you. It's kind of crazy she acts this way even at church as well.

I recently turned 18 and my best friend (who also recently turned 18) is getting married. 

I’ve never had an active dating life unlike my BFF (by active, I mean she’s engaged to the first guy she’s ever dated. they’ve been dating for years and it never got serious for me but it got pretty serious pretty quick for her) I never had something ‘special’ just some old childhood crushes. Nothing more than that. I’ve never even had a heartbreak or got rejected or rejected someone. (I mean people has asked me out but what can I say, I am a people-pleaser!)

So basically, I feel bad about this. Because she found ‘the one’ quickly, I feel like I’m late on finding ‘the one’. Is it ridiculous? Yes. Do I know that it’s ridiculous? Of course I do. I just feel bad for not having a love life at all when she’s about to get married. I know I’m young and I’ll have a ton of time to fall in love but I can’t stop feeling bad. 

It almost feels like I don’t want ‘love’ to be with someone and actually love someone. It feels like I just want it because she has it (not in a “I’m jealous of her” kind of way. i just feel alone and left out). Childish thoughts...

There was a woman there who I saw glancing at me from a far. Our eyes met and we both smiled and she turned to her friends and they all turned again and smiled at me. So a couple minutes went by and I decided to approach her. I just walked up to her with a smile on my face and introduced myself. 

She gave me a look of disgust and then said ew and told me she doesn’t date midgets. She then threw her drink in my face which caused my friends to come running over and caused her friends to come running over and both sides started yelling at each other. We all ended up getting thrown out and on our way of being escorted out with them she just kept on insulting me telling me I’m ugly and short and that I ruined her night. I’m 5’4 and I was standing when she smiled at me so idk what she was so upset about she can clearly see how tall I was. 

My friends wanted to go to another bar but I just decided to go home since I felt sticky and dirty from her drink. I wasn’t drunk so I was able to drive. I got home and showered and just went to bed feeling like shit. 

I also recently found out my friends ex girlfriend absolutely hated me. Couldn’t stand me one bit even though I never did anything to her and was nothing but cordial. Apparently she found me annoying and insufferable and that I was undesirable which is why she never tried to set me up with her friends. They felt the same way about me. Thankfully his new girlfriend likes me or so I think at least. 

But am I doing something wrong here? I feel like I’m constantly getting kicked in the nuts for no reason. Even my friends say I’m not coming off creepy so they don’t know what it is. 

Yeah I’m short. I know that but I wouldn’t mind dating a woman taller than me. It doesn’t bother me. I’ve been on 3 dates in my life and they all went terrible. I have no experience and honesty no confidence at all. I’m also dealing with a heart problem so that’s put me under some stress.

I (24F) went on a last-minute date with a guy (27M) last night. We were hitting it off, and everything flowed pretty well. At one point, we were talking about dating apps fails, and he mentioned that the last girl he went on a date with brought up politics which was a no-go for him. I asked him why/how in-depth she got and mentioned that I do understand why someone might ask because it really does relate to values and whether-or-not you would be compatible. We moved on past that conversation, and it continued to go well.

I am very passionate about human rights, so I know I mentioned a few things throughout the conversation. Nothing too crazy, though. It didn’t seem to phase him, and he reciprocated the conversation. At the end of the night, he kept talking about how he really wants to hangout again and that he felt like we got along super well. 

Fast forward to this morning, he said, “I had fun, but I really don’t like the whole politics/race talk on the first date. It rubs me the wrong way. So I need to think.” I apologized and explained that it was in context of our conversations, but he hasn’t replied. 

I’m honestly so confused. Am I missing something? I never pushed anything, and we really didn’t talk about it a whole lot. I feel like a date is a place where you get to know what someone is passionate about, so I don’t think it’s wrong to briefly talk about human rights when it comes up in conversation. I guess if this is a dealbreaker for him, then it’s his problem, not mine.

I’m so over dating at this point and was actually pleasantly surprised with how well the date was going. I’m pretty bummed out and confused. Has anyone had a similar situation? Any advice?

I (M17) like this girl (F17). Problem is, so does one of my friends (M17), we'll call him Jake. Some context is that this girl is brand new to our school and the state in general as she just recently moved. I feel the need to explain that she thought Jake was gay even though he claims he didn't know why she thought so because  he believed he displayed all qualities ""opposite to someone who is gay"", whatever that means. Anyway, she would make fun of him about it behind his back. Me and a couple friends would tell her multiple times that he wasn't but she didn't believe it. Then we told her it hurt his feelings and she apologized to him about it and said she was really sorry. This was a couple days ago.

As to my current status with the girl, we talk a lot and she doesn't eat very much so I'm constantly trying to make sure she's eating and we talk a lot and all that. She is so perfect the way she is and I wish there was a way I could tell her that, she feels the need to not eat so she can lose weight...which pisses me off because she is, again, perfect. I guess technically we're ""friends"", my other friend asked her who she liked and she said she really doesn't know yet because she's new and all that, which is fair. 

Anyway all 3 of us went to a school football game last night. Me and her kinda spent a half hour before the game started just walking around, we went to her friend's car and she gave me a ""gift"" which was this pink boa (the theme of the football game was to wear pink). We went to the stadium and then Jake got there. For the next half hour I stood there while she touched his muscles and like was feeling the face paint on his face and she would take off the necklace he was wearing and asked if she could wear it for a couple minutes and then asked if she could give it back after a little. She was taking pictures with him and sending it to her friends. She took pictures with me too, but was just saving it to her camera roll. There was one point where she kinda stared at him, and then whispered to her friend next to her and they both giggled. I couldn't really do anything as Jake was blocking me off from her. He is 200 pounds of muscle, not much I could do. I literally felt sick to my stomach just sitting there, I excused myself for a few minutes and seriously contemplated leaving. 

I left, and she messaged me if everything was alright, I messaged her back ""yea"", and decided that if she likes him, I wasn't going to miss out on the last home game of the season while all my other friends were there as well. My friend who earlier asked her who she liked got pissed at me for almost leaving and said that there's no way she likes him, and that what she did that night was just stuff girls ""do"". This friend is kind of plotting stuff behind the scenes to try and get her to like me or put us in situations where me and her are alone, he's basically rooting for me. 

I get back and she's glad I'm back. I don't think I mentioned that she did also interact with me a bit, she would take feathers from the boa that she gave me and put them in my hair or my hoodie. She also held my hand at one point kinda just like clasping them closed with her hands for a couple of seconds. I feel like this is irrelevant though because compared to how she interacted with him, that's nothing. 

I guess what I'm asking here is the title, I know no one is a fortune teller, and writing all this out again after replaying every scenario in my head is probably just making it crystal clear that she does like him. No one just ""does"" all this stuff if they don't like a guy. It's odd, because she was making fun of him behind his back just a few days before. My other friend keeps telling me there's no way she likes Jake, and that if she does, he'll make sure she wont. I'm not sure what that means, and I don't want him slandering Jake or anything like that, because I don't want me and Jake's friendship to be fucked up.

So I know on places like Instagram the good place to do it is respond to her story and go from there 

But what if they posted a picture? I planned to like her picture then send/forward it to her in the dms and go from there

So this girl I met on bumble we texting for a while, the first date she couldn’t make cause she was in the process of moving. The second date, the day of she said “ I can’t do this” and give me some explanation. She texted me later that night “ I’m sorry for standing you up twice, I know if someone did that to me I would be pretty upset and you seem like great guy. If we could once you get back in town wanna try again” I said yes because I liked her. We’ve been texting for another two weeks and we had a date at the park. I texted her this morning said “ we still meeting at 11?” and she said “yes!” I get their at 11 she’s not answering my message or phone calls (blocked)

We had really nice date , but the thing is lots of red flags, bad vibes  and she’s just not my type. We ended the date friendly, bit sadly for my expectations before the first meet but am also glad, cause vibes speak louder than words !!
