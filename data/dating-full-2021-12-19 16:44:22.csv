I'm 19 y.o. (in final year of high school) male, quite introverted (using mainly the people skills + few but close friends definitions) and possibly have a light social anxiety (fear of being seen as weird/awkward, not particularly looking to meet new people). I get very nervous, lose courage and tend to just say nothing or get awkward in new situations, when stepping out of known territories in personal conversations etc. This particularly applies to talking to girls I like when other people are around. Alcohol at parties helps me overcome this quite well (and not in the way that I do things I later regret), but, well, can't be drunk 24/7 (:

Recently I started discovering the complicated world of dating. And it's all these social norms and expectations what makes me anxious to take any steps that don't come 100% naturally. **Here's some questions that are running through my head, I don't expect specific answers for each of them**, it's just the best way to outline the confusion that I feel now. **I'll be happy for any kind of (even short) advice, even if you just point me to a good thread/different link with advice for similar people**.

*Are things meant to come naturally? Or do I need to consiously make moves to take things to the ""next level""? How clearly should I express my affection after we meet up a few times, when I'm not sure about her feelings? Often mentioned is excessive fear of rejection - is that meant here, or is it more about asking out? Any 'rule of thumb' when I should be more courageous, and when one really should be more careful?*

*Should the conversation simply flow and it will naturally get a bit of spice if it's right, or does one have to initiate it with 'ok, can I be upfront about something now' or something? Or how does one initiate these kinds of conversations?*

*How the previous applies in reverse - should I read signals and move on if it's a soft 'no' (doesn't text first, no moves either), or are men really expected to be 'hunting'?*

*This modern dating thing - it almost seems to me (from reading various places, not personal exp.) that people go on dates with 'hmm, let me meet this person and maybe something comes out' more often than not. Is that a common mindset, or do people more usually just meet somebody they 'click' with and it goes from there? To me, it happens that I fall head over heels for someone after seeing them once or twice, but I'm very much not sure about their feelings and it doesn't feel appropriate to just openly tell them...*

*Is it common that people make out, cuddle all night at a party with a bit of alcohol in blood, and next day just go on like nothing happened? Is the connection lost when reaching out after I got home feels like starting from scratch again?*

*How far is it 'healthy' to try to take it with friends from school, work or similar setting when I'm not sure about the signals from their side? Should I just observe if they also initiate conversation and show interest or else eventually let it go, or is it ok to invite her for yet another date and be bit more upfront? I'm quite overthinker, so I feel like I'm more anxious about the awkwardness that follows than the rejection itself...*

We were talking on Instagram and she says she isn't able to send pics..but then she shares me the screenshots of the chats proving she has sent a pic but there are some issues in the app.
Ha ha how come screenshots be shared and pics cant??When I sent my pic it went through so thats kinda very doubtful. Now she argues like lame bullshit person. Finally I blocked her 🙄🙄🙄

So I(21M) know this girl(20M) since school days (known who she was for a long time but was never friends with her). Last summer I met her through a mutual friend, and had a really really nice conversation with her, and me being the dumb idiot I am, immediately fell for her. She might not have been outright flirty, but she was hinting it (kept touching my bracelet/hand, gave me compliments about my muscles/working out). A few days later our mutual friend out of nowhere asked me to go out us 3 for a drink in the pub (which I took as her telling our friend she wanted to see me again). Keep in mind this is a very catholic and conservative environment. Long story short, I ask her out on a date, she agrees, then proceeds to give me the most mixed signaled date ever: First she says she appreciated that a guy like me was interested in her, then tells me that she can't because it would be long distance (I study abroad), and then tells me maybe? but the kind of maybe with a period (.) at the end of the sentence (Like Jesus Christ why do we guys have to get tortured like this why tf can't she be direct. On a separate day her friend told me that she ""would've agreed if the circumstances were different"". Anyway after this I pretty much was pissed off and didn't talk to her.

The day I left home to go back to uni, she texts me telling me to have a safe flight, which I never mentioned when I'm leaving (so she must've asked her friend. why? God knows.) I say thanks and again don't talk to her any further.

We had one conversation whilst I was away, which was initiate by me. All I can say is that she was very enthusiastic about the convo, but that's how she usually is in general.

Fast forward to a couple days ago, my plane just landed home, and I receive a message from her on the whatsapp group between me, her and our friend ( so not even privately), an old video of me in school. I laugh it off and again, don't go any further. I then get invited to a nye party, where she explicitly tells me to bring my friends with me(which I took as it's nothing intimate but friendly). Now i'm thinking ok so what the hell is up. My theory is she wants to keep me as a friend, and as a fail safe option. I am really patient with these types of girls because they truly are inexperienced as shit and extremely innocent, and this specific girl seems to have a bit of an inflated ego so I can seen why she would not be direct, but there's a point where even the toughest of nuts can make it clear that they're interested, and I'm just not getting a 100% answer from this one. You might ask why not just move on. 1) because this specific type of girl is really really hard to come by+ the chance where she actually might be interested, 2) I am insanely crushing over her. Like seriously everyday I was away I have thought about her. Every. Fucking. Day. And I don't even know if we're compatible, like we haven't even gone on more than 3-4 social gatherings. It's staring to really piss me off. I don't know whether I should start talking with other girls or wait a bit longer for this one.

I’m trying to get some advice on choosing to pursue a relationship with one person over another based on, to some extent, what they do for work - not solely based on this of course. But as a factor

For context I’ve gotten to know both of these ppl and am interested in both of them. So pretty even in my mind aside from the below. And maybe a few more minor things

One works in same industry as me, think a corporate job. She has career ambition and works really hard.

The other works in food &amp; bev. She works long hours and works really hard too, two jobs actually. But don’t think she really cares about the corporate world haha. Doesn’t seem to have career ambitions to the same degree, but she’s super cognizant of mental well-being which is awesome.

I think the dilemma is the first chick and I constantly talk about the industry and work related ideas which is productive, but it makes it difficult to cut off work after work. While with the second chick, work won’t come up unless I bring it up, this could be a good thing cause I struggle putting work away.

But I also feel like the first chick will push me more in my career just by being herself. Whereas the second chick is probably going to support me regardless of my career, so I might not be pushed much by her. I think it’s important to be motivated by your SO

I’m very ambitious myself in my career, might need to take a break for more school, but otherwise want to work my way up and build creative and useful things that make people’s lives better. The thing is, I’m still pretty bad at setting boundaries. But I also believe that’s something I need to address myself and not by another person’s actions indirectly doing it for me.

Am I wrong to give the other person’s career that much weight in my choices of who I pursue? Am I being ridiculous?

Also I just want to make clear I don’t think more / less of anyone in jobs whether it’s being a line cook, server or a lawyer. I try to just be conscious how different ppl’s lives and interests can be due to their jobs.

I was dragged out by friends to a smaller dance club. This is definitely not my scene but I'm happy to be with friends. When we were there I noticed a crazy cute and sweet looking girl sitting alone. When she went to the bar a few minutes later I went over and ordered a drink too, and started a conversation. Figured out her personality was as adorable as she looked and we talked for a while, laughed at how we were both dragged out by friends and how we're both too introverted for this club, ect. She told me about her favorite tea shops, her hobbies, her Animal Crossing island, ect, and she seemed to like talking to me. Her friends did come over eventually and we talked as a group about things to do in the city, ect for a few minutes. At one the cute girl said 'there are people coming watch out!' and pulled me by the arm close to her.

However, I somewhat unsurprisingly could not find the name she gave me, seeing as we're in a big city and I didn't really hear her last name. I considered running after her after I couldn't find it but I decided that might certainly be uncomfortable. Was this just a subtle rejection or did she actually want to see me again?

Hello everyone, first and foremost I am wishing you all a great holiday season.

So, I (21 M) have been dating my girlfriend (20 F) for about 3.5 months. I would say, that the relationship is great,  albeit one thing. I have noticed, throughout the relationship, that I am often the one who initiates texts after seeing each other “hey it was great to see you,” or “I miss you,” or if in person “you look so cute/ gorgeous today.” Although, these sentiments will be reciprocated after being said, she rarely, if ever, is the first to state sentiments like this. I have even noticed, despite this being an especially small point, that if I were to send a goodnight text such as “goodnightttt &lt;3,” she would reply without any hearts.

I think that this just frustrates me a tad, as it feels like sometimes feelings that I share aren’t being given the same attention back towards me. So, am I within reason to bring this up to her? Or would this come across as overwhelming/ clingy!

1 week goes by we still talking daily, I read things like ""you are kinda perfect"" and all that to which I reply along the same lines, if a bit scared but hopefull because we shared a few interests and had the same ideals.

- I started hanging out a little more with the girl, mostly cause she had more free time
- we go to the gym occasionally cause we're pretty much the only ones in the group that remotely athletic
- she's really into poetry and books and recently has been sending increasingly lovey poems and quotes over the last month
- I didn't know how to respond to these, so I usually just made a joke about it, or didn't respond
- I talked to mutual friend, and it's seems like she's trying to get me to ask her out, but won't address it directly, or in-person at all
- I don't have feelings for her

I just want to know the easiest way I can start a relationship with a woman without things being awkward. Just a female friend would be great for now to develop some experience with women and stop seeing them as creatures from space.

Hi everyone,

So for 19 years of my life I have never went on a date or done anything with a girl, not even a kiss. Mainly because I was never confident but that has since changed recently. 

 For the first time, I was going to go on a date with a girl. However, we had to cancel due to COVID (cases are rising where I live). We both mutually agreed that it’s a bit unsafe considering the situation. 

We both decided to reschedule in about 3 weeks (I’m going to visit family out of country) but it just sucks because I was really looking forward to this.

He did not accept. We were in the table with other friends and in the end we were only 4 people. He started flirting in front of me.

My issue is that I am very romantic and I look for long term relationship only because I don't enjoy casual sex.

-I tried to go into some bars, but I'm kinda too shy to act in a place like a tavern/bar or whatever. 

-There is a disco with shitty music, I should gather some friends to spend a couple of nights with to catch a random fish but at the risk of feeling deeply delusional and ashamed even if I hook up successfully.

-I am terrible at making social profiles or taking selfies, I could try to text random girls on Ig but I should make a nice profile first.
Instead in Tinder I won't get a single like, or if I get one it's usually a lot of miles away. 

I don't know what to do, I feel painfully lonely even with male friends, I miss cuddling and having deep conversations about whatever comes in my mind.

For me, I am a little fragile atm as last year I was rejected by someone who I thought was the woman of my dreams and now think that my read on women is broken (that's a long story that I'm open to answering about). I've also been ""talking"" to some girl in my hometown the last few months that honestly feels like a waste of my time because I have to initiate every damn conversation even though she was the one who wanted to date in the first place (again, can answer if needed) and it would be long distance. Now my coworker/best friend has been in four relationships in the last two years and three of the four were shitty relationships (one of the guys was a really nice dude but just was not emotionally invested and another was some guy who was infatuated with her since high school, finally started dating, and then it became sexless) including one that lasted for 6 years where she was physically and mentally abused while the fourth was barely a relationship.

Now the extent of the relationship between she and I, for at least what I felt like it was for the last year or so, was best friend behavior. We were there for each others personal life drama, we'd hang out after we got off work everyday, she'd give me rides to my apartment after hanging out/getting off work, and we constantly send each other memes/videos over Instagram. I also would categorize that our relationship is that we are more than friends, but neither in a romantic way or as a sibling-like as maybe potentially might date in the future. We always tell each other ""love you"" when I leave work to go to my other job. I think we both realize that being coworkers (especially when we both were single) that it wasn't a good idea to look at each other in a romantic way, but at the same time we were into other people anyways. Now, she's become only a part time coworker as she has another job elsewhere and comes to work at my place only once or twice a week. That clearly changes the situation. 

That being said, I'm not sure what to feel now considering the situation. I've had friends essentially tell me that I should pursue her now that we are both single. I've tried to look at her in a romantic way before and I honestly just didn't feel it and think still feel the same. But on the other hand, a part of my brain keeps telling me that I'm an idiot for not feeling that way and I recognize the fact that she's just an amazing person while also finding her to be very attractive. And while I don't trust my judgment anymore, I feel like how she dealt with her most recent breakup (only like a week and a half ago) as every day she has been sending me those Instagram memes (didn't used to be everyday) and talks with me at greater lengths than normal that maybe she might see me as a potential relationship (even the hugs are seemingly getting more intimate). Heck, she essentially invited herself to go see the new Spider Man film (which I'm super excited to see!!!) with me after she asked me who I was going with and had said by myself (I normally go to movies by myself as I'm pretty extroverted and it's just a relaxing activity for me to do). I could see that as friend behavior and it might be, but a lot of what she is doing is new in our dynamic so I'm just not sure and, again, my read is broken. One of my friends keeps saying I'm her go-to guy which I'm not sure what they mean, but it seems to be a thing. There's also the other part of me that makes me think that she sees me as a go to for comfort which I have been to her in the past. We're both damaged goods. While I find her to be very attractive and just to be an amazing person, I just don't feel like I'm getting that romantic feeling despite knowing all the factors.

A girl (18F) I've (20M) been talking to for about a month canceled our date this weekend and the reason behind that was that she didn't want to risk any of us catching feelings for one another, since we live 2 hours apart and she doesn't feel comfortable getting into a long-distance relationship at this moment of her life.

First off, that excuse is pretty weird since I only asked her out for a casual cup of coffee just to talk and get to know her better and she assumes we are gonna fall in love? Like what does she mean by that? And today (the day after she canceled) she left my snap-on read and I thought I had nothing to lose so I sent her a text explaining that I like her and that if she change her mind, later on, she knows where I stand in all of this. the way she responded gives me a major headache. ""Hahahaha so sweet of you, your number is still in my contacts you know :)"" Like what does she mean by that?! I just confessed that I like her and she has been giving me the same vibe just last week and now she is laughing it off? Does her response imply that she will contact me later on or how do I interpret that?

Btw she had on multiple occasions expressed her interest and that she genuinely thinks I'm a very sweet and wonderful guy. So her just cutting the contact after a month of talking just because she is afraid to catch feelings is very strange in my book, especially when I have never implied that I want a relationship with her except today when I told her I liked her.

long story short I've had crush on this girl for a while and decided to text her around a week ago (we've known before from school but never really talked much etc.). Things have been going good besides the topic of this post - I can't tell if she's not interested or if she's just a bad texter.

It takes her over a day to reply to my message, but when she does she always apologizes, really seems excited, she leaves me heart reactions all over the place, asks questions and answers those I ask. Then we end our conversation and when I reach out to her the next day - I need to wait over a day for her to appear online and read the message.

Well, it seems really weird to me because for me it's so exciting - every time my mobile vibrates I hope it's her text, while she just seems not to check messenger at all for several hours? If I were her I would check it few times a day to see...

I wanted to ask her out on a date in a coffee shop for this weekend. So I texted her on Thursday and thought that when she would have replied we'd talk for a while and then I'd ask if she wanted to go out on the weekend. But - you guessed it - she read the text on Saturday...

A few weeks ago I tried to connect with her in the hopes of rekindling the relationship. The moment I met up with her she burst into tears saying that she started to see someone. I was caught off guard as it had only been a couple months since we “split”. 

Fast forward to today and she still talks talks to me, uses my Uber account (she called me early one morning asking if she could because she was late for work), and sometimes receive messages from her about how she still feels deeply about me, how her currently relationship is nothing compared to how we used to be, how they haven’t slept together, and about how she regrets telling me because it’s not secure yet. I also teased her about having a new boyfriend, and she told me that he’s not her boyfriend.

This is pretty embarrassing, but I'll list out all my failed attempts. I have never tried hitting on women in public before.

I've had mixed results online dating. I move around a lot and some places I get 10+ attractive matches a week, some places like where I am, I get maybe one match a week or less.

My one match I went out with said she recently got out of a relationship and I was giving her relationship vibes. Another match was leaving town, so didn't go out. Third match was weird, then unresponsive.

Since I didn't have any other matches, I decided to go out and meet women. I'm by myself in a new town and going out to bars. One gave me her number and flirted all night but didn't respond to my text.

Another one I talked to said she was doing ladies night, but hung out with me until her friend got mad at her.

Then I met one woman and we spent most of the night dancing and talking, then when I go in for a kiss, she tells me she's in a relationship. She then tells me she wants to end it with him and would like to do it right and could see something long term with me. Then she gives me her number, but doesn't respond.

The other night I was trying to talk to a girl who was barely responsive. Then after her I talked to another girl who seemed super excited to talk, but then when I left for the bathroom she was dancing with a guy, not sure if they came together, because she came with a group.

I get a lot of compliments on my looks, get hit on by guys (by women too in my younger days). Any ideas what I'm doing wrong? Am I approaching the wrong women? I'm super shy, so this is the hardest thing ever for me.

Everything was going amazing until her sister entered the picture. We used to hang out often and enjoy every hangout. We never argued. We always had fun. We had our first ever argument about us not hanging out anymore as much and it’s clearly because her sister (20F). 

I first met her sister for the first time one day over Thanksgiving break. I hardly saw my gf at all then. Now, she’s back here for three weeks for the holidays and it’s really become clear where I stand. We’ve hung out even less and every hangout we have is shorter and is with her sister going everywhere we go. We get a few hours alone in the bedroom and shower. But, you guessed it. Her sister is right outside the door watching TV and we have to be super quiet.

So, this came to a head last night when I wanted her support after a rough week and our usual Saturday night hangout got canceled (no surprise). 

So, I asked her to call me. We spoke for a good 1-2 hours and it was all serious content (no small talk) about stuff I’ve been going through and she really helped me through it. We usually hang out Saturday nights, the only night I sleep over and hang out the whole day.

So, Sunday (today) comes around and no text from her and it’s already like 3 PM and no text. This happened last Sunday. I got a text at 6 PM that she couldn’t hang out. So, at this point I realize my expectations are the source of my pain and I need to lower them, so I text her that I want to give her space with her sister since she doesn’t see her often. So, let’s hang out Christmas. She tells me that she’s actually relieved because she wanted to give her sister the entire day because her SISTER WAS UPSET THAT SHE WAS ON YHE PJONE WITH ME LAST NIGHT AND THEY DIDN’T GET TO EAT DINNER TOGETHER. I’m like wtf. I didn’t expect that, but I had a feeling her sister was behind our drastic decrease in hangouts (she still hangs out with her friends just as much if not more, however). She asks for Tuesday (another usual hangout day), but I tell her honestly that I think we need space and let’s make it Christmas. She agrees and even thanks me for considering her sister and that she’ll miss me which I found a surprising response because it almost seemed to validate that her sister needs that much time apart from me (1.5 weeks of us not hanging out, the longest time we’ve been apart. The longest being when I was on a work trip for a week).

My honest opinion of the sister: She’s been rude to both me and my gf and has noticeable mood swings. She smokes a lot of pot every day. She’s really immature and selfish, kind of like how I was when I was younger, so I get it. Nevertheless, I went out of my way to help get her a volunteer research position for psychology career, making calls to a contact I knew, taking notes, and putting in a good word for her. She was somewhat grateful (but not really), but obviously it doesn’t really change how much time she apparently needs with her sister. 

I don’t know what do do here except what I’ve done which is step away and lower my expectations until this sister finally leaves and I can rejoice. Also, because they lost both of their parents, so I definitely don’t want to get in between them no matter how unhealthy her sister is. 

But, I wonder if I want to keep seeing this girl, what will I do if my relationship with her sister becomes unsustainable or even bitter?
