Im not going to whine, it hasnt been all bad, plenty of fun and good sex along the way.

But whenever i open up to a woman ive been seeing about wanting to date them/relationships/exclusivity they get really spooked and bail. 

When i probe a bit further, i get a lot of vague dismissal niceties that dodge the question. ""youre such a lovely guy"" ""i dont just dont know what i want""  etc etc. 

Ive dated up to 200 women on these apps, and had this exact situation probably about 20-30 times. 

Basically, to escape the groundhogs day of it, i want to understand what about me makes women so hesitant to commiting to anything more serious. 
I like to think im not completely repulsive/unlikable, or women wouldnt want casual dating/sex from me either. 

Or if it even is something to do with me, and not them and where they are.

Is there any way i can convince the next woman who this happens with to open up a little?

My ex was my first everything. We dated for a year and a half. In that time, he cheated on me with women from backpage, gave me two STDs, isolated me from my friends/family, and emotionally abused me.

On my date, I found myself getting more and more sad as the night went on knowing that I'm carrying an everlasting reminder of my ex's thoughtless infidelities, and how that inevitable Uncomfortable Conversation meant that this new guy wouldn't put himself near me in any way that we had both wanted to. 

He called me brave, and was understanding about it. He didn't run for the hills. It should have felt like a win for me, but I just feel like damaged goods. Even when we were fooling around, I started crying. All that anger and sadness I thought I worked through just came bubbling to the surface.

Despite all of that, I still like this guy very much. In a confusing, vulnerable way that scares me. I can feel myself readying to jump ship before he has the *chance* to even say he's not interested anymore.

The one guy I did do the deed with was so abysmally bad at it and painful for me that it kind of turned me off sex for like, four years 😂 Now I'm more comfortable with myself and finally have a real human libido after recovering from my eating disorder, so I want to jump into the dating pool! But I'm very, very far behind where normal women my age (31f) are at and I'm worried that's a huge red flag for guys.

One thing is that this guy is pretty attractive and charismatic and has definitely had sex with a LOT of women (he mentioned a bit about his exes and was in the military, not to mention obviously on tinder). I'm not sure if I can actually do casual sex - though I'm not resistant to trying - and when he invited me back to his place, I admitted that I had very little sexual experience and basically have been in a dry spell these last few years so I might have to take it a bit slower. He made a kind of ""oh, huh that's surprising"" face but didn't push further. Now I'm wondering if I've really kind of turned him off by being SO inexperienced compared to the chicks he's used to (maybe even prudish-seeming?). I guess if he doesn't want to go further then actually that is better for me, since I apparently don't want one-night stands anyways, but I'm worried as well that I'm turning off normal dudes who would actually be open to something serious. So (presumably normal) guys of reddit, is the lack of experience of your date an issue?

Things have been going pretty slow, but we’ve discussed that we’re both not in a rush for a relationship, so it’s been ok with me. So far, we have been out on a few dates, most of which he initiated and one that I initiated. After our 2nd date, he went out of town for the weekend and texted me throughout his trip but then didn’t reply for almost a week, and I thought I was being ghosted because we were texting every single day up until this point. I thought things were going well, so I decided to text him after a week to check in with how he’s doing. He replied shortly after saying that he’s sorry that he didn’t get back to me and that it means a lot to him that I checked in on him. Our texting continues as normal, and he’s actually more responsive to my texts replying quickly after a few minutes vs a few hours previously. Usually after our dates, he texts me saying that he had a great time and usually suggests the next date and continues the convo, replying every few hours until we see each other.

So our last date went well, and again he texted me later saying he had a good time &amp; said that we should get lunch next time. I agree and ask when he would like to go. We decide on a day, and then I ask where, to which he doesn't reply for the entire weekend. As we’ve gotten to know each other more, texting has slowed down a little bit between dates, which is normal as we planned to see each other and would save the conversation for our dates. I assume maybe he’s not sure of a place so I text him after a few days suggesting a place, and he replies asking to reschedule because he will be busy for the next couple weeks with work and school. I tell him that I understand and to let me know when he’s available. He hasn’t replied since then, and it has been a week. I know what it’s like to be extremely busy &amp; I’m trying to understand that he really may not have time to text me. I’m not asking for a text convo throughout the day, but at least a quick “how was your day?” would be nice. At this point, we haven’t discussed exclusivity, so I don’t know if he’s talking to other people. I’m normally not one to overanalyze someone’s texting habits, but I can’t help but wonder if this means anything? I feel like if he wasn’t interested in seeing me again, he wouldn’t have suggested another date only to ask to reschedule.

Have you ever been so busy that you can’t send a quick text/reply to someone that you're interested in? Is it possible that because he said he’ll be busy, he doesn’t want to text me at all until he’s fully available? At what point is it okay for me to reach out again, to ask how things are going with him or if we will see each other again? I know I'm never going to get answers unless I ask him directly, but I’m also one to believe that if someone is really interested I won’t have to reach out multiple times.

I had no intention of getting in a relationship at the time, just wanted to go out and meet new people. I ended up matching with a guy (22M) and instantly connected with him. He eventually ended up asking me to be his girlfriend which I reluctantly agreed to, thinking maybe things would work out fine (first mistake) despite him telling me that just a couple months ago he split from his abusive ex(I later found out it was more like days before)

This “relationship” lasted exactly 2 weeks. For the first week I subjected myself to sharing a twin mattress with him in the living room of his cousins apartment (with his 19yr old brother sleeping on the floor next to us) and me driving him to work Friday-Sunday for his 7pm-7am shifts and driving back and forth to my house 50 min away. 
He was always texting and calling me, totally enamored. I was slightly more reserved but showed him I genuinely cared for him. And also made a point to make sure he had anything he needed 

Second week comes around, his cousin whom I never saw at the apartment demands I never return, my bf starts to get so high that he is practically putting himself in comas, but I try to remain positive while expressing concerns which he took as an argument and refused to talk to about because he “can’t do conflict”. Few days go by and he dumps me claiming he needs to work on himself and his depression but I’m perfect for him and he will tell me when he is ready, promises not to get back on any dating apps or talking to anyone. A week later I find out he’s back on tinder and eventually learn that he is publicly mentioning on Twitter that he used me as a rebound and never wanted to be with me. I felt angry and very stupid for not realizing I was being used and even after months I still remember it sometimes and feel angry about it.

I messaged him apologising for how I was acting that day and he replied. He didn’t really acknowledge it and say he’s busy himself. He asked me out on a day at the beginning of the week so I followed up. I said I still want to see him and I’m free this weekend, if that works for him.

He said he’s usually free on Fridays but he could move things around since I’ve given him enough time. He took hours to reply, didn’t message him in the morning or night. I still like him and want to see him but I don’t want to force him to do something for my benefit. 

Neither one of us were pursuing each other before. It feels like I’d be pursuing him if I continue. The problem is I find that very unattractive and if I went on a date, there’d no romantic feelings whatsoever.

I know I caused this but I don’t know what to do next. He’s an amazing guy but I’m not sure if there’s anyway to salvage this.

But I DON’T like when a girl is ready to sleep with me after knowing me for 3 hours.

For one, I find it a turn off. I absolutely love a chase. To have to impress a girl, to actually work for it. If all I have to do is buy you 2 drinks for about $14 and walk you home, that is VERY cheap sex. Immediately kills attraction for me. If you’d do it with me that easily, how many other guys would you do it with?

Secondly, I couldn’t have great sex straight away. I take time getting to know a girl. Getting comfortable with her, finding out what she likes, letting her know what I like, understanding each other’s boundaries. I can’t build that intimacy in 2 hours. And even if I can, it’s a bit forced. Plus if we’ve been drinking, chances are I won’t perform as well either.

So for all those reasons, I hate the pressure of sex on a first date. And I dunno why…but most girls I take out seem to think that’s the vibe I give off? Like I’m built, tall, got tattoos, stubble, hair cut on point. I understand I give off the bad boy player vibe but absolutely am NOT that.

How can I meet girls who aren’t easy? Is drinks a very ‘sex straight away’ kinda date? Should I be avoiding that on a first date? Idk.

There's nothing wrong with your virginity, but do you not see the problem you have and yet most men like you are male feminists and are mostly virgins?

There's nothing wrong about being a feminist either, but I've never seen many sane &amp; confident MALE feminists. Or that's at least what I've experienced.

Oh, and so about the men shaming.. I've literally seen upvoted comments like ""older men approaching younger women is harassment"". 

Like wtf? Yes, most younger women won't go for an older man. But those men know that every once in a while they're going to find one that will luckily suck them off, hence why they keep approaching.

I'm in my early 20s and I have few female friends who love older dudes. The thing is, they don't like your average older dude. They want a better looking than the average older dude, which is fine. 

But just saying, shaming older men for trying to go for young women is just silly and you probably have some problem with yourself. Maybe not even those oldies want you. 

Besides, I never see people complaining about cougars hunting down younger men. 

You can pretty much ask any fit and attractive male that goes to gym about their experience with being approached by older women while they are busy with their fucking workouts.

And yet none of them feels offended, harassed nor do they want to call the cops lmao, even if they reject those women constantly.

Harassment is more like when a man or a woman doesn't take a ""no"" for an answer and keep bothering you. Write it down somewhere, it's important. Stop confusing it with normal daily human approach lol.

25M here - so a few nights ago, I went on a blind date. One of my close friends set us up after I told her that I found her work friend cute.

I got her number, we exchanged a few messages, asked how her weekend was, she asked how mine was, then organised drinks for 4 days later. We didn't text at all, until the night before when I messaged her to confirm the date.

So, for the first date, we organised to meet at a bar in the city after work. We met up, had a drink, then another. The conversation and banter was flowing well, and it felt like we both were having a good time. I’m a pretty forward/direct person, so I asked her ‘are you having a good time’? - she said ‘yes, i definitely am’. I then asked ‘are you feeling hungry?’ - she said ‘yes, I could eat’. I then asked ‘I have a few places in mind, lets fo get some food?’ - she agreed. We decided on a place, walked there and had a quick dinner. The jokes and chat kept going superb. We then took a walk to the train station, we held hands, and I told her I’d like to see her again - she said she would to. We briefly discussed this and we said Sunday night might be an option - I said I'd text her to confirm.

I texted her the day after the date, maybe late in the afternoon around 4 - I asked how her day was, and also mentioned I had an idea for Sunday night if she was down. She briefly said her day was good (didn't ask how mine was), and said she's still organising some stuff for the weekend as her parents/brother are visiting town - she said we could aim for early next week, but will still let me know asap once the plans are finalised. I responded later and said no issues, and to let me know. She then messaged me the next day (last night) and offered Tuesday/Wednesday night after work for the next date. I responded this morning and said Wednesday is fine, and confirmed time. She has just responded and said Wednesday sounds good, and asked to change the time slightly (we're meeting after work).

My question is - should I confirm the time change, AND ask how her weekend was? I feel like I'm overthinking and overanalysing the fact that she brushed my question about her day last time. My friend said that if I had just asked about her day (and not mentioned the date), she would have reciprocated. I feel like there should be some general chat between the dates, and whilst we went cold in the lead up to the first date, I think it'd be nice to have some chat in the lead up to the next (knowing we both had a good time and are interested). I don't want to come off as too keen, but also don't want to not show her I'm interested? Maybe leaving the chat for the date and assuming she's not much of a texter might be a safer option.

I am of East Indian descent; however, I grew up in California. I have been told numerous times that I am a good-looking guy, and some people are even shocked to find that I have never had a girlfriend before. Throughout much of my adult life, I have been overlooked by girls. I have seen Indian guys score girls, yet I would be left with nothing and it often makes me think just ""What exactly is it about these guys that make them particularly appealing?"" ""What exactly do these guys have that I do not?"" I have a fair complexion for an Indian so I am quite often told that I do not ""look Indian"" but rather Hispanic or middle eastern, which irritates me. I am very insecure about my figure, as I believe that it is the sole reason that people have never respected me- I am 5'8"" with a slender build, which makes me look a lot younger than my actual age; I could very easily pass for 22. Many of these Indian guys may be taller than me-6'1"", however, they are not exactly the most refined of people- they are very callous and rude. Many times, where girls have expressed interest in me, there has always been some jealous male that has ruined it for me. I have tried using dating sites, such as Tinder, and much to my chagrin, I have never matched even once in the past two years that I have been using the app. For a while, I stopped caring by reassuring myself that I can live without a girlfriend, but unfortunately, I am reaching an age where I need to find someone. 

I ought to mention that I would prefer to date a girl outside of my ethnicity. I must profess that anytime I see a brown guy with a white girl, I become infuriated with jealousy because I often think that if that brown guy can score a white girl, why can't I? What exactly does that brown guy have that I don't? I wouldn't feel the same way if the guy were White, Yellow, or Black, but only Brown. 

One could contend that there may be something about myself that I could change, and I completely agree; however, one attribute about the physique that I have not been able to change is my height, and I know that women do care about that- they are lying if they tell you that it is not important. Consequently, I am strongly considering undergoing cosmetic limb lengthening surgery, which would essentially make me 5 inches taller, and put me at 6'1"", and not to mention people wouldn't bully me and women would be more likely to express interest in me. 

If I were a brown guy standing at 6'1"" and not 5'8"", I would be respected and not bullied as much as I have throughout my life. I am constantly told by women that I look like a little boy and not like a grown man simply because of my small build. 

It is my misfortune to have been dealt with a very bad genetic hand at birth; however, I do plan to redeem by making myself taller to improve the quality of my life and ultimately ensure my happiness.

The first girl ended up texting the day of the date saying that she was tired from work, and wanted to push back our date to a later time that day. I  was already starting to feel what was coming but I told her that's okay and I can't wait to see her. Exactly one hour before the date she tells me she is tired and  wants to reschedule for next week. We already had to reschedule before, so I told her I didn't want to reschedule again and I felt she being flaky and she told me she felt she didn't do anything wrong and that life happens. 

The second girl hit up about hanging out the same day the first girl cancelled and she seemed very interested in seeing me, so I hurried and got ready and went to see her. She looked more beautiful in person than her pictures, and I instantly felt a connection with her. We hanged out and had heavy make out sessions for four hours. When she had to leave I kissed her and told her text me later. Once we started texting later that day she still still texting me like before our date and seemed interested in seeing me again and I told her I had fun and like her, but the next day she started giving me one word answers, taking a long time to text back, and seemed generally uninterested in talking to me. I asked her to go out again and she suggested a place and time, but it was like pulling teeth to get her to text back, and now I haven't heard from her in two days..She's out of town now but I have a very bad gut feeling and I don't think she will text me back, or if she does she will definitely  cancel the  date. It sucks because I really like her  and I don't know what I did wrong =(

&amp;#x200B;

The third girl has I've been talking to for a couple weeks and she likes to flirt with me and ask me if I  will come see her. I knew she had some issues going on, and she lives kinda far away from me, but I still wanted to see her. So I text her to try to schedule a date, and she tells me I thought we talked about this before. I was confused and told her what are you talking about, and she tells me that she doesn't drive or have a car., and her boyfriend drives her everywhere. I asked her then how are we supposed to meet, and why were you asking to meet in the first place. She didn't answer my question and I haven't heard from her as well.

&amp;#x200B;

The fourth girl I started talking to last night and I asked if she had any plans, and she told me no. I then tell her I don't have any plans either and that we should go out on a date. She then tells me that she would like to but she had to finish some work that would take a couple hours. So I'm thinking to myself didn't you just say you didn't have any plans. lol So, I just ignore it and mention some places where we can go on a date on and she says she wants to go and if not that night then we could schedule a  different time. I'm still waiting to hear back from her, but I don't count on it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really getting tired of this and don't have the energy to keep dealing with this.

Now think of the times where you met someone you were into, but things flamed out eventually, or if it developed into a relationship, it seemed like a constant struggle. They constantly tested you, they had members of the other sex constantly in the background, they were closed off towards you.

This is the importance of inner game and developing yourself, and taking care of your physical appearance so you are the most attractive, interesting person possible. The numbers will skew in your favor, so that a higher number of people will have a high level of attraction towards you, and you won’t need to use tactics or methods to win them over, which will ultimately still lead to a less than favorable experience.

I feel like as of lately if I’m not doing summer salts with my dates they make comments about me being shy and why I’m not already comfortable with them after one date and then loose interest. I know this sounds silly but I genuinely feel a shift in what men’s expectations are in terms of comfortability after a couple dates. Any insight would be really helpful as it’s starting to make me feel pretty bad about being reserved early on which I know is wrong of me to feel.

She had some anime related pics so I used that as my opener, and we started a pretty nice conversation about that and our hobbies in general. Sometimes she took a while to reply but when she did she sent me long and we'll thought out messages, which to me meant that she was interested. I followed this initiative and texted her the same way.

However, we were talking normally and it was now Thursday. I saw she hadn't replied to my last message, so I just sent her a _good morning :)_. Again, no reply. Finally, Friday came around and I sent her a gif about an anime she mentioned in her bio, and I texted her that I was looking for something better to send her but couldn't find anything, and that I hoped that she was having a good day. 

That was the last thing I texted her. I opened the app this morning to see if she had replied but she only read it last night. Do you guys think maybe I was too overwhelming? Or maybe I'm overthinking and she's just busy and she'll come around to answer?

Many of the posts spin out the typical male conspiracy theories about all the hot women sleeping with the same few hot men.

Here's a recent example:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/od73bw/what\_do\_you\_think\_is\_leading\_to\_the\_tension/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/od73bw/what_do_you_think_is_leading_to_the_tension/)

The post sparked my interest - both because it followed the typical conspiracy narrative, but more so because it did pose this interesting question:

""I haven’t been in a relationship and don’t know why""

I had read on this topic a couple years back, and specifically an article in the Washington Post discussing a then recent survey done by NORC.

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/03/29/share-americans-not-having-sex-has-reached-record-high/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/03/29/share-americans-not-having-sex-has-reached-record-high/)

The title says it all, and confirms the idea behind the Reddit posters comment.

""The share of Americans not having sex has reached a record high""

The article presents this summary of the survey results:

""For most of the past three decades, 20-something men and women reported similar rates of sexlessness. But that has changed in recent years. Since 2008, the share of men younger than 30 reporting no sex has nearly tripled, to 28 percent. That’s a much steeper increase than the 8 percentage point increase reported among their female peers.""

Here are the theories mentioned in the article

A. Lower male participation in labor force.

relevance: Men who don't work cant' form stable relationships

B. Young men also are more likely to be living with their parents than young women

relevance: when you’re living at your parents home, it’s harder to have sex

C. Technology

relevance: young men are happy to be playing video games at 10pm - too happy

I am going to share my opinion about another possible explanation:

D. Helicopter parenting

relevance: 20-something men and women didn't socialize as kids

Today's young adults didn't socialize as kids they way that my generation did.

When I was 8, me and the neighborhood kids were running wild on our ""secret trails"" through backyards and alleyways.

When I was 10, we were playing ""doctor""

When I was 12, we were playing ""spin the bottle""

When I was 14, we were drinking and smoking pot

All of the above was coed, mostly outside the house, and without parental supervision.

So kissing and petting before 16 was the norm.

Without this early co-ed socialization, kids and especially men, aren't developing the social cues that will allow them to navigate the relationship space as young adults.

So what's the solution? Here's one idea from a great podcast I listened to recently: Make dating fun again. If you missed out on the fun as a kid, you have to find it as a young adult.

I find it hard to text him because he makes me nervous, phone calls are worse.

I was having a bad day and I pretty much avoided everyone, him included. He asked how my day went and I wasn’t honest. My response seemed blunt. He ignored me for the first time in the month we’ve been speaking.

I messaged him apologising for how I was acting that day and he replied. He didn’t really acknowledge it and said he’s busy himself so he didn’t really notice it. He asked me out on a date at the beginning of the week so I followed up. I said I still want to see him and I’m free this weekend, if that works for him.

He said he’s usually free on Fridays but he could move things around since I’ve given him enough time. He took hours to reply, didn’t message him in the morning or night. I still like him and want to see him but I don’t want to force him to do something for my benefit. 

Neither one of us were pursuing each other before. It feels like I’d be pursuing him if I continue. The problem is I find that very unattractive and if I went on a date, there’d no romantic feelings whatsoever.

I know I caused this but I don’t know what to do next. He’s an amazing guy but I’m not sure if there’s anyway to salvage this. Also I’m not happy constantly, is this going to be a repetitive cycle every time I need space he’ll just ignore me.
