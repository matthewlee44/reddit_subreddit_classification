2,qnmt26,1636152839,Feeling sick about sending dick pic.,"I understand that this is kind of par for the course with online dating. But as a guy, this is the first time I‚Äôve experienced this. 

I started talking to a woman from Hinge Wednesday night and on Thursday morning the conversation got flirty. She said she liked bald guys and that her theory with bald guys was that they compensate for it elsewhere (implying that most bald guys are bigger under the pants). 

Last night she was asking me to prove her theory after some more flirty conversation, so I sent her a dick pic. Then I tried to FaceTime because we were sexting pretty hard by that point and she answered the FaceTime in a dark room and didn‚Äôt say anything. I couldn‚Äôt see who was on the other end. After about 10 seconds she/they hung up. Now my oh shit meter is full force. She also doesn‚Äôt seem keen about actually meeting for a date and ignored my request to send a photo of her face with my name on a piece of paper. 

I‚Äôve just felt sick about it all last night and today. Typically the catfish are easy to spot and not on hinge (or so I thought). Poor photos, bad profiles, bad English, want money at some point etc. I saw no red flags. Now I know not to send nudes unless I actually know the person. Thankfully I had the presence of mind not to put my face in the photo but I just feel gross/used/tricked by the whole thing.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qnmt26/feeling_sick_about_sending_dick_pic/

So I‚Äôve never been in a serious relationship or even close. Things seem different with this guy. He picked up on the fact that I don‚Äôt text a lot or like to force conversation. 

I really like phone calls so every so often whether we‚Äôre seeing each other or have just seen each other he makes sure to call. He gives me updated throughout the day and it‚Äôs starting to feel normal.

My friends noticed I was texting while we were out which is completely out of character for me. They asked what I was even saying to him. I told them I was just checking in telling him what I‚Äôm doing. They found it weird. I told them he does it too and I like it.

I have no idea if this what people do. He‚Äôs not controlling. Should I be concerned? I tell him because I want to. He tells me because he wants me to know as well. He never says I can‚Äôt go anywhere and I don‚Äôt stop him either.

To which she replies:

""oh haha! yea that sounds fun! i definitely want to be better friends with people at work""

my initial reaction was pain and attempting to accept the fact she's not into me like that. however, am I overthinking this?

12,qnng9p,1636154852,Frustrated because my girlfriend says my date ideas suck!,"Me and my girlfriend dated for 5 1/2 months last year and broke up‚Ä¶
Honestly it was during the winter time and we would just go on dinner dates nothing crazy. I did take her to the beach and a vineyard though. 

We ended up reconnecting a year later and have been together since April. This summer I decided to go all out. I really wanted to impress her and win her over. I love her more than anything.

So I rented a boat about 4 times and a jet ski. Took her to the beach for a couple of days. I bought scuba diving gear so we could go snorkeling at the lake. We‚Äôve been shopping multiple times. Took her to this Japanese marketplace they had all kinds of foreign drinks, food/candies. Rented a hotel twice like a 5 star. I bought a pool and a hot tub.

She‚Äôs a heavy stoner (me, not so much) but we do drink a lot and smoke a lot. 

Lately though I feel like I‚Äôm running out of ideas. It‚Äôs November (in Texas) and summer is over. I had called her today and said I wanted to do something crazy or start being more adventurous. She says oh really like what?

I opened with ‚Äúwell we have never been to a bar and shot pool before..‚Äù

She goes ‚Äúoh my gosh I gotta go bye.‚Äù

Now she was in the process of giving her dog a bath but it still made me feel like crap. She constantly mentions my ideas are kinda lame and I just wing it..

Personally I do alright so money isn‚Äôt an issue and I have never really had a serious girlfriend it‚Äôs always just dinner and movie. Basic stuff nothing interesting‚Ä¶ My friends tell me I‚Äôm over stressing and she‚Äôs not being fair to me.

I honestly don‚Äôt want to lose her or bore her so I‚Äôm trying to think of some ideas that are kinda out there. Adventurous‚Ä¶ Again I don‚Äôt mind spending like $100 - $300 but nothing more. 

I really want to surprise her though and do something cool. Here‚Äôs a couple of ideas.. We are both in our early and mid 20s also.


1) Hot air balloon rental?

2) Luxury car rental?

3) Aquarium/Zoo

4) Escape Room

5) Horseback riding

When I unblocked him I‚Äôd not reply him and I told him that I cannot come to his house coZ I don‚Äôt want to have sex. So we stopped talking for about a month then about 3 weeks ago he started messaging me constantly and checking up on me, he asked if we could go on a date so we went bowling, watched a movie and had a meal (he paid for everything) he then asked me to stay over and at this time I was hella turned on because I find him extremely manly and I like how I feel safe and protected when I‚Äôm with him, so we went to his and we had sex ( the best, maybe because I was just getting turned on by him as a person) . Then he dropped me home this afternoon 

The thing is when we first ever met he told me he is not he isn‚Äôt looking for a relationship, but him doing all this effort made me think that he now wants one. But I know that‚Äôs not the case.

Soon we would park cars next to each other and wjen sitting next to each other, sometime our knees or feet would touch and neither of us would move it.

Never got his number but we chatted through DMS on insta and he let me know he wasn't interested, weird ok so i backed off.

A year later, he slides back into my DMS to ""check up on me"" where he asks me if I am still interested. Obviously I lied and said no but asked if he was. He answered ""wydm"" and claimed he was just checking up on me, weird ok whatever.

Now, another year later, we have a few classes together once again. Only one is in person and he is again looking at me, sitting always behind me, and will wait for me to pack up before slightly following me to the parking lot.

A few days ago, we got placed into a group for another class and he was so on to me about everything! It was the weridest thing. There was another girl in the group and he barely acknowledged her... He would be like ""do you want to go before me, I'd love to hear your thoughts.""
""What are your ideas on blah blah blah"" 
""I love that idea so much you are brilliant blah blah blah""

I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs over for me.","Recently I was out with my girl friends and me and the other guy there stepped away from our table to play pool. The girls were there alone. At one point I saw some guy walk up to them. This guy was not an attractive guy, and as a fellow ugly guy I noticed that it takes a lot of confidence to do what he was doing. I kinda stood close in case he was a creep and I was able to hear him speaking. 

He introduced himself and asked one of the girls there if she would like to play darts. She declined, and he left. That was it. Maybe a 1 minute interaction.

They then waved us back over to them to ask us if we saw that. They then went on about how creepy it was. Now maybe I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs normal or not, but it seemed like a perfectly innocent situation. No creepiness, no ill intentions, just asked a girl to play a bar game with him. To me it seemed like he want about that situation as well and as confidently as possible.

I question how and they said I wouldn‚Äôt get it since I‚Äôm a man.

This got me thinking, they have all told me other instances of guys hitting on them and then being creepy, that I didn‚Äôt think was creepy or weird at all. I assumed maybe I just couldn‚Äôt visualize it. 

I‚Äôve also heard how positive interactions with guys go and it isn‚Äôt any less creepy or weird.

28,qnoi8x,1636158112,Tale as old as time : crush on my coworker,"Is this a rant? Is this me seeking advice from strangers? Let‚Äôs find out!

As always: English isn‚Äôt my native language and I‚Äôm on mobile. 

So, I‚Äôm a woman, he‚Äôs a man, both around 30.
I should preface this by saying this is a job not a career. So as awkward as dating/breaking up goes I wouldn‚Äôt really put that into the balance. Think of something on stage/entertainment. And after covid it‚Äôs hard for artists and performers to find jobs so we found this job that does provide us with a job daily but also bad hours bad pay and most employees can‚Äôt wait to find better things elsewhere. 

So now, we are close and definitely have a special bond but I have a 15years history of being friendzoned or worst seen as a sister (ew).
I can find men to fuck but dating is a mess. I‚Äôm not ugly but I‚Äôm not hot HOT (Overweight so probably where the sister thing starts from).

Trying to be as objectif as possible, not including some self deprecating comments or overvaluing things that happen, here are some facts:
- As I was saying we do have a special bond, comparing to the rest of the team. We definitely have a top 3 friends but we text a lot LOT one on one despite a 3 people groupe chat already active. 
- we hugged, are affectionate.
- he stayed at my place twice as he live farther suburb from the job and I‚Äôm in the city and he would have had trouble to commute those days or early morning the next ones. But he would use termes like ‚Äúcrashing‚Äù at my place nothing ambiguous. The first time he slept on the couch and the second we shared my bed. I know. Nothing happened except hands ‚Äútouching‚Äù under my pillow. And now I‚Äôm like, am a 17?! Wondering what our fingers brushing mean? Am I actually into something because holding hands is more intimate than fucking? 
We did drink a lot that night too and it was fun and we talk a lot and we were close but always on that line of nothing happened. Right after that night I had a early meeting so I left and then we had another one with our team and than we were not on the same schedule so it was kind of a ‚Äúnothing special happened‚Äù.
But if I‚Äôm honest, I was harsher on him later that week because I felt more ignored or was it because he would would do something he usually does between us and our 3rd aforementioned friend, and that‚Äôs where you eyeroll: he talks about his dates! yay
Cause I know he‚Äôs been dating around. Like one girl regularly plus other dates than the regular stopped it I think. Now he goes on dates. I think with one same girl for about a month but still very much on all the dating apps. So that the thing, he‚Äôs a 30yo man who has been mostly in relationships and I totally get dating around now that he‚Äôs single. 
But.. *what about me?* 
Do I act on my crush/attraction? Is it useless as he probably just gonna say the usual ‚ÄúI like you but not like that let‚Äôs not ruin our friendship?‚Äù Am I gonna suffer either way? 
Should I just try to actually see there‚Äôs a spark? 
Is it a bad idea as I obviously WILL catch feeling from a fwb situation?

I guess it was both a rant and tons of questions. What should I do, you silly-and-wise Reddit?

34,qnovty,1636159366,"Things got steamy, then we ended it 2 days later","So I (25F) had been seeing this girl (24M) for over a month. We would text paragraphs to each other daily, met 3 times, and hit it off really well each time spending at least 6+ hours together each time. The texts would also be flirty at times, and sometimes we would end up staying very late and sexting (no lewd pictures).

Anyway, on our 3rd date, we were discussing about going to one of our places. She told me she likes to take things slowly with these, so we confirmed to each other we wouldn‚Äôt have sex. We went back to her place after having a few drinks (we made out and shared some sexual touches at the bar).

At her place, she immediately changed into a hoodie and a thong and we were laying next to each other kissing. She would make me touch her breasts, and also asked me to choke her and as things happened, dry hump. We touched each other down there through underwear, and would tease each other as if to take off the underwear but not doing it. The next day, she said she was so happy she brought me home and texted me all day about how fun it was.

We had plans to meet a few days later and she had said she would come to my place this time. But she texts me saying that she doesn‚Äôt want to because things progressed a little too fast, to which I happily obliged. Then she said ‚Äúmy words didn‚Äôt align with my actions‚Äù the last time, and blamed me and alcohol for making things happen that night, even though she made me do things to her both in the night and the morning once we woke up. This made me feel weird and I said I wasn‚Äôt trying to push boundaries, and I would like to restrain from kissing and physical touch just for our next date so that I could reaffirm to her that I don‚Äôt need physical touch, and that we can both move past what happened early for her while having fun in just each other‚Äôs companies.

She then called me later and said she highly regrets what happens, I should have not let it happen, and she holds anyone she sees to high standards of sexual restraint, so we can‚Äôt see each other anymore. I really liked this girl and I feel terrible, because she‚Äôs misremembering or ignoring her actions and choices in what happened. Did I deal with this incorrectly?

I felt like a piece of shit not reciprocating her feelings, but I did what I had to do. After that I was venting to some of my friends, I'll call them Andrea (22f), Liz(21f), Alex(m25) and kat(23f). I'm venting telling them that I don't really want to get tie down due to my job(I'm a cook/bartender) and I have a very flirtious personality. I'm tall and I consider myself handsome, and if my tips are anything to brag, I have a magnetic personality and a good income, I live alone and have a lot of confidence in myself. 


My frien Kat, Alex and Andrea all call me out about how I dream of having kids and a family, yet pushed away the only girl that would potentially date me seriously considering my lifestyle. They argue that what I'm saying doesn't match my actions. (Wanting a family, but not actively looking for a real relationship)


My main argument agaist that was that I don't want to officially date anyone due to the way I talk to some of my female customers(no I don't harrased them, I been working at a bar for 5 years, I know when they are interested in me) , due to this interactions I feel like it would be unfair to any girl I date, as it would seem like cheating.


They claim that I'm not really a guy that anyone would date seriously, I'm not father material nor husband material, and that kinda stung a little. And looking at my coworkers, they seem right all of my coworkers are late 20s to late 40s and all of them don't have kids and seem depressed, only putting up smiles for customers. 


All of this stress kinda made me reflect and I realized that I haven't had a real relationship since my high school sweet heart almost 4 years ago. And I realized that all the relationships after that were either a 1 night thing or I was a rebound. 

I ask liz(ex gf) and she said that I'm just not build to a serious bf. I'm not someone that any girl would bring over to their parents house nor am I someone that seems to have a future considering my career. This honestly breaks me, I want to have a family, it's something I never had as a kid and something I always wanted.

A few days later I ask her a question about soccer as we both play the sport, and she doesn't respond. At this point I just figure she's not interested and I'm ready to move on

In the next week, she's staring more than usual. If I'm behind her, she'll glance over her shoulder, if I move to her other shoulder she'll start looking over that shoulder, she'll stare at me in class and she'll glance at me when she passes in the halls. If I look over and make eye contact, she'll look away quickly or it will last a few seconds. The staring has been going on for a few weeks, so 5 days after I text her I ask her after class if she got the texts, she did and she said she was at soccer when she got the text, and so she couldn't respond. She apologized a lot, and has still been staring the few days it's been since I asked.

There is a mutual friend that we have that said she sometimes won't respond to her texts either, and that she's mentioned me when I'm not around.

59,qnreev,1636167896,Tips for men online dating,"I am writing this post to help a lot of men date successfully. This does not apply to all men or women-only some. But it's simply a few tips you can use to facilitate actually meeting someone and avoid having your time wasted. Keep in mind I do not know what dating is like for women. I am just speaking from the perspective of an average guy who learned to date the hard way but now avoids many pitfalls dating. Here are some tips:

	1. Realize that many women online don't know what they want.

	You talk to the average girl online and many have created their profiles for fun. Some like attention, some like to just chat without any intent to date, some just wanted to download the app because they were bored etc. Avoid them at all costs. You can spend days, weeks, and months talking to them only to realize they still don‚Äôt know what they want. I've met some on first dates and they were still indecisive. Just drop it and let someone else deal with it. You will save yourself a lot of time in the long run.

	2. Pay attention to warning signs

	Early on some women will clue you in to their problems. If they always talk about drama in their life then chances are they are doing things to create it or not actively trying to solve it. Do not get involved as you will likely be caught up in it. Just drop it. 

	3. Being the nice guy never works

	This tip is crucial. If you're overly nice to some women it becomes a turn off. They will not be excited to meet you, they will not return your texts or phone calls and generally speaking any connection will die off. I'm not advocating being a jerk, but just don‚Äôt overly assert yourself and aim to constantly please some women online.

	4. Measure things by 24 hours and 2 weeks

	I stick to this rule rather firmly. If any girl can't decide if she's interested in texting, talking on the phone, video chatting or anything beyond the app or the website after 24 hours don't waste your time. It'll never go anywhere. I've spent days, weeks, and months and many women never come around. Just drop it. By the same token, if she doesn't want to hangout or go on a date within 2 weeks just drop it as well. At this point many are just too busy to date and aren't worth chasing. 

	5. Do not get mad

	Never bother explaining things to a lot of girls. Don‚Äôt go off on them. Many won't listen and some won't change from anything you say. Just let them go and delete and/or block them. 

	That's all I have. I hope this helps to save some time dating as it did for me. I'm sure this advice could apply to guys as well but again, I am only telling this from an average guys perspective.

60,qnrf57,1636167967,Nervous about meeting a guy,"In two days I‚Äôm meeting up with a guy who has been my friend for several years (but we‚Äôve always kind of had a bit of chemistry, and ages ago told each other that we liked each other). One time we kissed too, which was really nice, but then Covid-19 happened and so we weren‚Äôt really able to see each other for an entire year due to the continuous strict lockdowns that happened in my city. Now we‚Äôre able to meet up, which I‚Äôm looking forward to because we always have a good time and have lots to talk about. The only thing is - I feel a bit nervous. Why? Because during the lockdowns I struggled quite a bit with my mental health, and I suppose I turned to food as a form of comfort/as a way to feel good. I gained 13lbs (6kg) during the lockdown and now I feel a bit self-conscious about it. I‚Äôm hoping he won‚Äôt notice. I know it sounds a bit ridiculous, but do you think he would? Do you have any tips on how I can feel a bit more confident about myself (physically) when meeting up with him again? I‚Äôm planning to start losing the weight ASAP, for me to feel better about myself overall. By the way, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and my current weight is 175lbs.

62,qnrg3j,1636168063,Tips for men dating online,"  I am writing this post to help a lot of men date successfully. This does not apply to all men or women-only some. But it's simply a few tips you can use to facilitate actually meeting someone and avoid having your time wasted. Keep in mind I do not know what dating is like for women. I am just speaking from the perspective of an average guy who learned to date the hard way but now avoids many pitfalls dating. Here are some tips:

1. Realize that many women online don't know what they want.

You talk to the average girl online and many have created their profiles for fun. Some like attention, some like to just chat without any intent to date, some just wanted to download the app because they were bored etc. Avoid them at all costs. You can spend days, weeks, and months talking to them only to realize they still don‚Äôt know what they want. I've met some on first dates and they were still indecisive. Just drop it and let someone else deal with it. You will save yourself a lot of time in the long run.

2. Pay attention to warning signs

Early on some women will clue you in to their problems. If they always talk about drama in their life then chances are they are doing things to create it or not actively trying to solve it. Do not get involved as you will likely be caught up in it. Just drop it. 

3. Being the nice guy never works

This tip is crucial. If you're overly nice to some women it becomes a turn off. They will not be excited to meet you, they will not return your texts or phone calls and generally speaking any connection will die off. I'm not advocating being a jerk, but just don‚Äôt overly assert yourself and aim to constantly please some women online.

4. Measure things by 24 hours and 2 weeks

I stick to this rule rather firmly. If any girl can't decide if she's interested in texting, talking on the phone, video chatting or anything beyond the app or the website after 24 hours don't waste your time. It'll never go anywhere.

At this point many are just too busy to date and aren't worth chasing.

I'm pretty angry- initially, everything was great. Super respectful, very romantic, the works. We went on two dates and then slowly things started to unravel. 

Near the beginning, he did this thing once where he went 24 hours without contacting me (I had texted him in the morning). I  texted him and I got worried and I said ""hey can you not do that? if you're super busy just let me know."" He agreed w/ me and said he wouldn't like it if I did the same thing so he'd for sure never do it again.

We only went on two dates because he said he was super busy all the time and that everything would 'settle' soon. As a COO I get being busy and he's in a family business so I was like, hey I get it! We can go on dates when you're ready. Just keep your line of communication open.

Well, he did it again. He went to the hospital and his brother called me and said it was no biggie and he'd be back soon. He went MIA for four days and came back and was like ""lol hey I'm fine"", and was, at first, upset that I was even upset. His reasoning for taking so long was that he take an MRI for his shoulder pain.. and it took four days (???). He apologized profusely after he realized the severity of how upset I was, and said he'd never do it again.

He did it again, it's been two days and he's ignoring my calls (his phone ""situation"" has always been weird- he never picks up when I call him and I just basically have to wait for him to call me back). 

At this point, I'm so over it. I feel like he just fake apologizes for things and then does whatever he wants. I'm so mad at myself because I feel like he he just wasted 3 months of my life and for what???",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qnrpgm/minighosting_and_hes_acting_weird_m28_3_months_of/

This guy and I met on Hinge 2.5 weeks ago. We‚Äôve both been sick &amp; busy since then, so no plans were made or brought up until yesterday. He asked if I‚Äôd be up for a late brunch date tomorrow, I said yes, he said ‚Äúgreat, I‚Äôll call you tomorrow night so we can plan. :)‚Äù 

Well, it‚Äôs ‚Äútomorrow night.‚Äù He has been busy with school and friend stuff today, which is absolutely fine &amp; I love that he has a solid friend group, but I feel like he would‚Äôve had time to carve out 5 minutes (or even 1, idc) to text me and ask about a time he could call. He‚Äôs the one doing stuff today, so I didn‚Äôt want to bug him too much. He did send me a few texts today, which I appreciated, but none were about our plans. 

I don‚Äôt expect constant communication in ANY relationship (friend or romantic), but is it irrational for me to be thinking, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been 2.5 weeks. If he was into me, he‚Äôd know it by now. He‚Äôd let me know he‚Äôs into me by asking about a call time or letting me know he can‚Äôt call because he got wrapped up in something else.‚Äù?

I‚Äôm feeling like this is a situation where I am 100% a fallback. I‚Äôm not sad or mad or anything, I‚Äôm honestly just kind of annoyed, I guess. I don‚Äôt make plans with or offer to call someone without either being sure I can follow through, OR communicating that I can‚Äôt follow through for whatever reason. 

If midnight or later hits, would it be rude for me to send a text and say something like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to assume you‚Äôre not interested if something came up that kept you from calling, but I do want to ask if you‚Äôre interested in meeting me or if you‚Äôre not into it. The lack of follow through makes me think that it‚Äôs a lack of interest, but I know things come up and plans change, so I didn‚Äôt want to assume and wanted to check in and ask first.‚Äù

88,qntkz9,1636176206,Just venting about my experience with a Narcissistic ex-boyfriend,"I (21 F) met this guy (21 M) on Tinder. We'll call him J. J was very affectionate, loving, and gave me all the attention at the beginning of the relationship. We were only a few weeks into the talking stage and I had ghosted him a month earlier when he messaged me again the same day I opened up Tinder once again. I had nothing going on that day, so I was like ""what could possibly go wrong?"". And let me tell you, I regret ever responding. J made the effort in messaging me, responding to me, he would always initiate the conversations, and even would call me during his lunch breaks at work or while he was driving from work. I was impressed by how much effort he was putting on early on the relationship when we weren't even dating yet and thinking like ""wow maybe this guy is actually serious about me"". Fast forward 3 weeks I invite J over to the State Fair with my friends as a casual date. The whole day, me and him were immediately attracted to each other and the chemistry was there as my friends saw us talking all day with each other while we were at the fair. He also was a complete gentleman, every time we got off the rides he would offer his hand or hold my hand when I would get nervous. We both didn't want the night to end, and I honestly remember feeling so happy that night and he also called me after I got home to tell me how special he felt like everything was. Shortly after that, we planned our second date at an aquarium which was also very casual at first but then ended up becoming really steamy later in the night when we ended it with us both making out in his car right before I left to go back to my car and drive home. For the third date, I invite him over to my apartment. Now I wasn't intending for things to escalate, but they did and we ended up having sex the same night he came over. Again the chemistry was crazy, I was obsessed with the guy the passion was there. He stayed the whole weekend at my place and everything was just right about him. After that, he would drive almost every weekend to see me, he would commute the 1 hour to see me back and forth. I even visited his family's house and stayed over a weekend and I met his mom and his dad. I thought to myself ""Wow this guy introduced me to his parents, and he's constantly making the effort to be with me in this relationship"" what more could a girl want right? I was happy being with him, but then the more he came over, he was mentioning to me how he needs a place to move out to after I told him how my current roommate is leaving on such short notice. In my gut feeling, I didn't feel ready for this guy to move in with me even though he introduced me to his parents because we were still early on in the relationship. I was hesitant when he first brought up the idea of us moving in together telling him every reason why I'm saying no. Yet, he showed me this perfect version of himself when he would visit me. Cooking for me, taking care of me, being there, and cuddling me. I thought after he spent weeks convincing me again ""What could possibly go wrong?"". Everything went wrong after that. He broke up with me 3 weeks before he was going to move in citing that ""we're incompatible to be in a relationship"", mind you, we had just had sex the night before and were cuddling before he said that the day after. We had already signed the lease, I didn't have a roommate nor did I have another place lined up on such short notice. At first, I asked him if we could just take a break in the relationship and just focus on ourselves since the whole move can be stressful. He said, ""Sure. ig it could be a break"". I told him strictly after he broke up with me even though we were living together that we can't cuddle, kiss, or do anything like a couple then until he decides he wants to be in a committed relationship with me again. I tried setting up so many boundaries, I remember doing what I could to try and protect myself emotionally, but I still let him in. At first, respected my wishes for a few days, but then things would escalate. I would see the same guy I fell in love with the first time every time I saw his face I was thinking of potential, not reality. He would come sleep in my bed even though we have separate rooms. He would come late at night and cuddle against me and I felt like we could mend the relationship and work together to grow. But I was wrong. Every time I would establish boundaries again he would gaslight me saying ""You see me as some cold heartless bastard, then that's what you'll get"". Anytime I mentioned how I felt, how anxious or depressed I feel with how our situationship was, how he was hot and cold and never steady and consistently loving towards me, he would lash out against me. Then the next day he would come into my room to apologize and say he's sorry and that it won't happen again and then we'll have makeup sex and cuddle and I'll think that he's trying again. This cycle will repeat another few months until one day he decides to bring over a girl from work. Now I get at this point we are not dating, but we both have been involved constantly and he was always messing with my emotions since we lived together. I confront him about the girl (19F) she doesn't even know that me and him had history. Girl continues to come over saying I should get over him and move on with my life. The man that used to kiss and cuddle me and bathe me and take care of me had decided to lash out against me with the girl from work present in my own apartment. They both tell me that they're just friends, but I'm not fucking stupid whenever he would pick her up and she would stay the night in the same bed I gave to him. At that point, I let him think I didn't know and plotted to show the girl what kind of fucked up narcissistic manipulator he is. I set him up one night when I said I was really horny. He said he wanted a backrub and I obliged to mention it the next morning when the girl came over again. Ironically that same night girl texts me asking if J is with me. Girl goes crazy once she realizes that J has been using her like how he was using me. He had a new supply, as I was no longer helping him emotionally, physically, nor financially like before as I had a higher income than J. The girl and him were only dating for 2 weeks, but she told me how they have been having sex and sleeping together and J would tell her to not tell me that they're together. I was angry with the girl at first, but I should have been angry with J this whole time for discarding me like trash and disregarding my feelings. After that happened, I kicked J out permanently. I told him to pack his shit and leave as I didn't want to see him anymore after all the lying and cheating and manipulation. It has been about 3 weeks now since he was here. It still hurts so much to think that a man that gave you all this love and attention and made it show that he was serious about you at some point to realize that the man I met never even existed. He was this fake version he showed of himself because he knew no one would've fallen for the real him. J is so fucked up the fact that I was crying in front of him telling him to stop and he laughed in my face telling me to move on. I would never wish that level of pain on anyone. For the first 2 weeks, I couldn't stomach anything to eat, I lost 15 pounds already being so skinny. I couldn't sleep. All I felt was numb from the pain thinking why would he do something like that to me when all I showed him was love and kindness welcoming him into my home and buying food for the both of us? In my process of healing, as much as I wish I have never met him. I am thankful for the lesson I learned early on in my life with a narcissist. He's out of my life permanently, no longer even in the same State. I know I'll meet someone that is genuinely a good person, but right now after what happened that experience completely traumatized me and changed my perspective on love and trust entirely. I know time heals all wounds and I hope to move forward from this and grow.

89,qntldo,1636176251,How long should I wait for him to ask me out on a proper date?,"Sooo I met a guy two weeks ago at a party where we danced a lot, and then spent about 3-4 hours together talking and making out. That same night he told me that was interested in me (after I told him I wasn‚Äôt going to sleep with him that night), and we continued talking the next morning as we took the same bus back home. 

He texted me the next day and he asked me out to coffee that week which went well and we were able to talk a lot more and get to know each other a bit better. 

This week I texted him asking if he‚Äôd like to do something and he said yes, suggesting thursday during the afternoon (which didn‚Äôt end up happening as I got busy). on Wednesday afternoon he texted me asking what my plans were for the day and then asking me if I would like to go to a pub crawl that evening. I said yes and when i showed up we danced a lot, made out a bit  and talked about what we want. I told him I was interested in getting to know him better and also asked him if he sees this as a one-night stand situation (aka is he just waiting to sleep with me) and he told me that he definitely sees it as more than that. 

I do think that‚Äôs he‚Äôs genuinely interested in me as he asks questions, remembers a lot of things I‚Äôve told him and hasn‚Äôt tried to have me go back to his place or anything like that.


Butttt, despite me feeling like there is a mutual interest, aside from coffee, he hasn‚Äôt really asked me out on a date. He did text me yesterday asking me how I was and what my plans were for the evening (to which I replied saying I had plans), but I feel like at this point in time, it would be appropriate to ask for a more formal date, no?

Is it possible he‚Äôs shy or doubting my interest?should I initiate asking for a date? How do I go about asking for a dinner date (or something more formal)?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qntldo/how_long_should_i_wait_for_him_to_ask_me_out_on_a/
90,qntnv2,1636176553,Shyness insecurity,"Is there anything wrong with being a shy person?
I hear that it's a turn off to women. I'd like to think that being shy makes me really care and understand a girl's feelings. 

Girls say they want to take things slowly, not be used or taken advantaged of. But that's like what a shy guy values too. He just needs more time to get comfortable (this allows time for the girl to get to know him), shy guys aren't gonna just push sex immediately (they're scared just like girls).

But everywhere I go, I keep hearing that a guy has to be confident and smooth and not afraid of anything. I'm really trying my best to overcome my shyness but I believe I'm always going to be a bit shy. But I just feel less of a man because I keep thinking shy guys aren't what girls really look for in a guy.

92,qntwli,1636177597,Dating after abuse,"TL/DR:
I haven‚Äôt dated in a long time and I don‚Äôt know what I should do or be feeling. I‚Äôm scared to let go and enjoy myself. Especially since I feel bad for being a burden due to my past abuse. 

I have been with my ex 30 (m) for 4.5 years and for 1 year we were engaged. He was my best friend but things became abusive after awhile. There is a lot of issues there but the example I want to use is this. I‚Äôm 24 (f) and don‚Äôt have my license, I had a fear of driving after my dad was hit by a car and passed away. My ex played into it and wouldn‚Äôt let me drive ‚Äúfor my own safety‚Äù. 
I left him finally a month before our wedding. All I can think though is that he is the only one who would being willing to put up with me. He is the only one who can accept me and my past. ( I come from an abusive family and he did too). Now that I‚Äôm an adult and can‚Äôt drive, I feel like a burden to people. I always feel like a burden and that I‚Äôm not worth it. 
But I tried to date again and I met this amazing guy. We connect on everything. He went to college for what I‚Äôm currently studying, we have similar beliefs in politics, a lot of the same hobbies and it‚Äôs easy to talk to him for hours and never get bored. I know he likes me. He made the move for the first kiss, he calls me on the phone when he has a long drive and he keeps saying how happy he is when he sees me and keeps planning the next date. 
But I‚Äôm to scared to trust again and I feel like a burden to him. He knows I have a car since I finally just saved up money to buy one. It‚Äôs not on the road yet but I didn‚Äôt tell him about not having a license. I‚Äôm embarrassed by it. But I feel like I need to tell him the truth. But we come from different world, he grew up differently then me. He is from another country and moved to the US for college. He comes from a happy family and money. I have a lot of abuse in my past. 
I know I‚Äôm not obligated to tell him about my history right now but I feel like I can‚Äôt keep the driving a secret. He knows I have a fear of it due to my dad but he doesn‚Äôt know the rest. 
Before you give me any advice I just need to say a bit more of the situation. We met on bumble and we talked and got to know one another. Then had our first date on Halloween and it went amazing. We talked single day since then and had our second date on Nov. 4th that also went amazing. So we haven‚Äôt been dating to long yet. He stated he is looking for a real relationship and from how he speaks to me I can tell he is interested. He have a date planned for the 7th, he asked if I wanted to go to his house for movies or go on a hike. Then he said we should do a movie and he said I could sleep over and drive home in the morning. I reminded him my car isn‚Äôt on the road yet. That made me feel like crap. 
That lead me to a bad night of self hatred. Like why am I dating again? I‚Äôm just a burden. I‚Äôm not worth it to anyone. He doesn‚Äôt know about abuse, he shouldn‚Äôt date someone like me. He should be with someone normal.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qntwli/dating_after_abuse/
93,qntynu,1636177849,Pulling out?,"So im hanging out with my crush form college in hopes of getting into a relationship. So we were hanging out today and we started talking about contraceptions.

I dont know how common this is, but i have heard my best male and female friend have used this method. I dont have a lot of sexual experience, almost none, but i thinks its pretty risky, im not ready to be a parent and to give my child a good life, and im afraid of getting her pregnant. Any advice?

And when we first met, she was intriguing as she's also a great conversationalist. Overtime, I've still communicated with her daily via text. However, for some reason, that I don't know, Im just not as motivated to call her. Like calling her seems partially seems like a chore now. I don't know why. I did mention to her that I wish she had more interests and hobbies of her own. After which, she found her self telling me that triggered her because she's been struggling to find herself and things that she likes to do. As for me, I have many hobbies and interests. So I partially feel like I'm unequally adding more value to this relationship.

97,qnu9j7,1636179154,Starting to rethink everything,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, love is beautiful and to be treasured but these days, especially in such a toxic society, dating is becoming more of a burden.

I‚Äôm not the most compassionate and loving person but when I care, I CARE. Guys that I‚Äôve spoken to and had situation-relation-whatever the hell üòí with have said I‚Äôm wifey material or that I take really good care of them or that I have great motherly instincts but NOT ONE has tried to make me more than a body for them. 

So I‚Äôve come to a place where I‚Äôm over questioning my worth and constantly praying and wondering when will someone value that part of me. I am good with being single forever. I know that‚Äôs a huge thing to say/ write but I‚Äôm honestly at a point where it is what it is. 

I‚Äôm not holding out for someone, looking through my window for Prince Charming, scrolling through dating apps to find anyone. I‚Äôm good alone and if someone comes along well good for you but I‚Äôm not holding my breath. Now, I‚Äôll focus on me and my goals and future. And just find true happiness.

99,qnuq3t,1636181230,Does she mean what she says when drunk?,"I‚Äôm (33F) very casually seeing a woman (40F). 

We have a really great connection and luckily want the same thing: a long-distance friendship where when we do see each other, we enjoy each other‚Äôs company and hook up. Nothing more serious than that.

We live far apart, and we text and talk on the phone every couple of days. 

She drinks a lot and often. 

When she‚Äôs sober, she‚Äôs not vulnerable at all, and definitely doesn‚Äôt express much in the way of feelings, especially about me. We talk casually about our work and hobbies. 

When she‚Äôs drunk, she‚Äôs much more talkative, vulnerable, and tells me she‚Äôs really into me. She lists all the reasons I‚Äôm ‚Äúperfect‚Äù in detail. She sexts assertively and writes long role plays where she calls me her girlfriend and strongly expresses her interest in me not just sexually but as a person and partner. It‚Äôs super hot and flattering, and really enjoyable. 

I‚Äôm really into her, and I love our current casual status; I‚Äôm enjoying my single life and don‚Äôt want to be in a serious relationship. She is with someone else and doesn‚Äôt have any plans to change that. Perfect - we‚Äôre on the same page about not wanting to enter into a serious relationship with each other. 

So I‚Äôm not looking for relationship advice as much as I‚Äôm looking for information: 

(1) When someone expresses these things while drunk, especially multiple times and in the same way, is that because they feel that way sober, and alcohol just lowers their inhibitions so they‚Äôre just expressing what they feel? Or can alcohol significantly exaggerate feelings that might only be mild? 

The reason it matters is because when I express affectionate things to her, if she‚Äôs sober, her responses have textbook ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not that into it‚Äù vibes. But if she‚Äôs drunk, SHE is the one pouring praise, affection, admiration, romance, and sexiness toward me. Lately, in our sober conversations, I‚Äôve found myself holding back and staying platonic because I can‚Äôt tell if she enjoys me initiating that stuff. I‚Äôm getting completely opposite signals between when she‚Äôs sober vs. drunk. So, I‚Äôm asking this question to see if I should just stick with platonic conversation, and just enjoy the moments (and reply accordingly) when she initiates affection/more. 

I would normally just directly ask someone how they feel, but I‚Äôm hesitant to ask her directly, because I don‚Äôt want her to get the impression that I require an answer. Part of what we both love about our situation is the spontaneity and lack of expectations. (I know, I know‚Ä¶ good communication is always an expectation‚Ä¶ but help me out here üòÑ)

TL;DR - If someone says something whenever they‚Äôre drunk, is that likely their true feeling, or could alcohol be exaggerating the actual feeling?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qnuq3t/does_she_mean_what_she_says_when_drunk/
