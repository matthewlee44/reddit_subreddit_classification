She agred, she saw and she wanted me to be her fwb. We started talking and talking, she kinda fell in love with me after we talked for a bit but she said that she isn't sure about her being in love with me altough we can try. Well few times we met and did some naughty things in my car. Meanwhile i fell in love with her but she said that she's sure she isn't ready and we can be fwb's and just that. I got frustrated about it and i stooped contacting her with her saying that she really doesn't wanna have a boyfriend for a really long time. Fast forward to the October 2021 i contacted her, apologised for my behavior thinking she still has no bf because i wanted to revive our fwb relationship. And this is where things went wrong. She said she's okay with reviving our relation but without the fwb part cause she has all of a sudden a bf.. and i'm crushed. I feel really devastated because in the end i'm always a 2nd option or not even an option. It doesn't matter if i'm trying to be with someone or even to just have sex. At the end they just fall in love with another guy and i'm feeling stupid and used as a teddy bear for their dark times until they found someone else.

1,qls2w5,1635937612,Should I tell my new dating partner that I still have feelings for my ex boyfriend who is still my friend?,"I am in a dilemma. I'm currently dating someone new for a month now. We both told each other that we fell in love with one another. And it's beautiful and great and everything is awesome. 

I am also still friends with my ex boyfriend. We separated 3 years ago and worked alot on forming a friendship and we made it work. He has a new girlfriend now since 2 years already and we are all very good with each other. My new dating partner also knows that we are close friends and is totally fine with it.

What is also important to say: I still have feelings for my ex. He knows about that and we are very honest to each other. Also VERY important: I don't want a relationship with him anymore. I just still like him alot and that is perfectly fine. So there is NO problem here. So conclusion: my ex and me will never be in a relationship again because neither of us wants that. He also has no feelings for me anymore. 

But I really want to be honest with the guy I am dating currently. Because we have been honest to each other about really heavy stuff already and I appreciate this so much ! And I feel like I have to tell him that I also still like my ex. I wanna tell him that it doesn't change anything between us. Because it doesn't. 

I believe that you can love more than one person at a time and that love is not a finite resource. I talked about stuff like this with him already and he agreed. But I didn't tell him that it's the case here that I still have feelings for someone else.  

I don't really know what to do. I kind of wanna tell him and tell him that it won't change anything between us and that I will never date my ex again in any way, but on the other hand I sometimes feel that I shouldn't tell him because in the end it doesn't change anything and I am scared that he might leave. Maybe it could cause more damage than making sense telling him. Maybe he doesn't need to know? I don't know.  

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation and could give me some advice on this ?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qls2w5/should_i_tell_my_new_dating_partner_that_i_still/

5,qlsl05,1635939608,How to get into a committed relationship? {19F},"So I know I‚Äôm still young and all that, but I would really like to date around while I still have the spirit for it haha

I‚Äôve only ever dated people online before, but it was while I was still a minor and I would say only one was serious. Even if I do count that one relationship, that‚Äôs just about the sum of my dating experience.

I do have anxiety when meeting new people (physically) and especially with men. I don‚Äôt typically adhere to societal norms, so I‚Äôm clueless about what to do when going on dates (men and women included). I‚Äôm more of the ‚Äòdo what I want‚Äô kind of person lol I do at least know not to make an ass of myself, keep off my phone, ask questions, etc. But flirting? Knowing when the vibe is off? How to know if they‚Äôre into me? Nada.

So I‚Äôd like to know some signs a date is going well or even how to go about setting up a first date. Also, at what point do dates turn into a relationship? I‚Äôve always felt that it‚Äôs single until asked (or vice versa) to be in a closed monogamous relationship but apparently that‚Äôs not how it works??

I do ‚Äòtalk‚Äô to more than one person at a time to keep my options open too. I have made a faux pass in the past before by mentioning other guys I was talking to in conversation with another guy I was talking to. He had to explain to me why being so forthcoming wasn‚Äôt always the best lol

Oh and when is a good time to have your first kiss or vaginal sex? I haven‚Äôt been on many dates and honestly the ones I have been on ended up with us having sex or just becoming friends. I have had issues with offering sex when I wasn‚Äôt interested in *just* that, but I felt like it was something I had to offer or else they‚Äôd lose interest (this only happens with men).

And yes, I DO have unresolved trauma but we are working on that !! Much thanks in advance :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qlsl05/how_to_get_into_a_committed_relationship_19f/

11,qltbx0,1635942377,"A girl who ghosted me via OLD came to my workplace yesterday...it was, interesting...","About a month back I was on tinder and matched with a person who I tried (and failed) to organize plans with. I gave her my number and attempted to organize something with her, and it was like pulling teeth. Pretty much a similar story to what a lot of people on here go through. One response a day, very non-committal to actually organizing a solid day and time down. I ended up getting frustrated with the situation and blocked that person out of my phone because (like most people) I have zero time for being messed around or bread crumbed. 

Fast forward a month on and a couple of cute girls come down to where I work just as I begin shift. With it being a hospitality focused job, I have to interact with customers to sell more drinks and get photos for the website. I noticed this girl but didn't realize it was this person I had met on tinder, she didn't look like her photos (actually preferred her real life looks) and I didn't make the connection who I was talking to. After I took a few photos and had a bit of banter, I walked away joking that the photo I had taken was awesome and she should whack it on her social media ASAP. She responded ""Well I don't have you on my socials, do I?"" and proceeds to add herself to my Facebook.

She leaves, messages me straight away, and we've been talking since. We have solid plans organised, she responds almost immediately even if I've left it hours through being busy. It is like talking to a completely different person. I'm guessing she hasn't realized who I am either and has no idea of our previous disastrous interaction. But it's crazy how different the conversation is after meeting in person as opposed to matching on a dating app.

I don't drink alcohol or go to clubs so it's hard for me to meet people and having women at work be so forward is incredibly rare, but stuff like this makes me wish I was a naturally more social person and could just meet people organically in person, it's SO much nicer than dealing with being constantly ghosted or treated like crap on those apps.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qltbx0/a_girl_who_ghosted_me_via_old_came_to_my/

I read an article on Mail Online (can't post links) and I can see where they are coming from, but I can't help to notice that non college educated men, especially blue collar workers that in most cases make above average salaries and in places like the US easily reach a 6 figure salary, aren't even considered as people (the article simply ignores their existence) and ascribes money, degree and looks as the only viable traits for a long term relationship.

I'm definitely not trying to take any digs or jabs at anyone, but ask people here out of genuine curiosity, especially women if they agree with this stance and why because my cursory observations and anecdotal evidence doesn't really seem to support this. So... A guy in this forty's with a stable life and income, that's let's say average across the board is *'unmarriageable'?* I would like to know why.

*'We're seeing generation of young men who think they're Adam Driver or Michael B. Jordan. Of course, it's not about them. It's the ratio.'* 

*In his book, Birger makes the case that 'hookup culture' among students 'trickles down into post-college dating' and that 'lopsided ratios have been a driving force behind both the rise of the hookup culture and the declining marriage rates among the university educated.*

*'Of course, university sex ratios wouldn't matter so much if we were all more open-minded about whom we date and eventually marry (which I think we should be).* 

*'But at the same time university sex ratios have been skewing female, there's been a simultaneous increase in what academics call 'assortative mating'. That's a fancy way of saying that college grads only want to date and marry other grads.*

*'There's been a ton of scholarly research on how sex ratios affect culture, and what it shows is that the dating culture tends to be more monogamous when men are in oversupply.* 

*'But when men are in undersupply, the dating culture becomes less monogamous ‚Äî men are more likely to treat women as sex objects and treat relationships as disposable.'* 

*He says the shift in attitude may be subconscious for men, adding it's 'human nature' to get carried away after receiving excessive attention.* 

*'If a guy is getting a lot of attention from women, he's going to think he's deserving of all that attention. It's human nature. When women get a lot of attention from men, some women think they're special too.'* 

*He also believes that this phenomenon is prevalent in workplaces with a higher female to male ratio.* 

*'Because of the way the math works, Golden Penis Syndrome probably affects men in their 30s and 40s more than those in their 20s. At least the heterosexual ones. Imagine you have a dating pool that starts out with 40 women and 30 men, which is a 4:3 ratio.* 

*'Once half of the women get married ‚Äî once 20 of the women get married to 20 of the men ‚Äî the dating pool among the remaining singles becomes 20 women and 10 men ‚Äî a 2:1 ratio. This is why we all know so many fabulous women in their 30s and 40s who cannot seem to find a decent guy.'* 

*He says that older women seeking a husband should avoid men who have never married into their late 30s and 40s who have high-paid - even dubbing some of them¬†'unmarriageable'.*",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qltf3g/how_golden_penis_syndrome_is_ruining_dating_for/

23,qluo45,1635946736,I'm (33M) not entirely sure if girl I've been seeing (32F) is as serious as I am,"Hey everyone,

I (33 M) met up with a girl (32F) after speaking on Hinge for a few days. We had our first date on the 23rd of September and it went really well. We both don't drink so we shared a few cokes and spoke for about four hours. We exchanged numbers, moved to texting, and continued talking.

We both were busy after the date (I had a pre-planned trip with friends, and she and I both got vaccinated so had a mulligan week where we didn't plan on any dates). To keep the momentum going, I suggested a phone date and she agreed to it. We spoke for a few hours and continued texting afterwards. Side note - she lives at home with her mom and step dad and said she's very much a homebody.

She shared quite a lot with me after each date about her interests, and she admitted she is ""quite shy"" and introverted. I'm extroverted, not overly so, but I think the biggest issue I see for she and I is this difference. We feel the same in a lot of other areas and I feel really comfortable around her. She has stated the same.

I scheduled our second *real* date (mini-golf), but she had to cancel because her mom got sick and she thought it may have been Covid. At this point, since we hadn't known each other for that long, I wasn't sure what to think. I gave her the ""1-time free cancel pass"" and the benefit of the doubt. 

We continued texting, and our schedules lined up for our second date. We grabbed some coffee together.

I felt 95% of the date went well. She brought me a (gag) gift, laughed a lot, was very talkative and a bit more vulnerable about her shyness, etc. I felt very comfortable as well and liked where things were going.

So the last 5%. Admittedly, I lose track of time during conversation, and we'd been out for about 2 and a half hours. Her being shy and introverted, I wish I would have caught maybe some queues that she wanted to leave. During a break in the convo she did say she was getting tired and was hoping we could throw our coffees away and head out. She also mentioned she has a family thing coming up, and I'm also heading out of state in two weeks for about two weeks, and as we left she mentioned if we should ""plan on seeing other again after those trips"".

 I said agreed in the moment, but looking back if that were the case it would be a month before I see her again, which is the time between dates #1 and #2 as well (ignoring the phone date in between).

I gave it an hour and text her after the date thanking her for the gift and her time, and she responded as she normally has. However, I'm bit confused regarding her interest.

Is it just shyness/being out drains her? Should I position another phone date and be up front and ask her? 

What do you guys think? Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR

A month between date #1 and #2 (phone date in between), but lots of productive texting/positive banter/photos back and forth. She admitted to being ""quite shy"" and introverted, and is a homebody. Dates #1 and #2 went well, but I'm not sure if she's just a bit socially awkward or disinterested in seeing me again. She suggested date #3 after she and I's individual travel plans, which would make that date over a month away. Wondering at this point if I should be up front with her and ask if she's interested in where this is going, or let it play out naturally.

The issue is I've lacked convinced so I never made any real moves / officially asked her out on a date before (or anyone for that matter). So now after college and in a stable job, I would like to start dating but am still probably over thinking everything.

I'm not sure what to say exactly. I basically want to meetup to catch up, but would like it to be as like a first date, instead of just as old friends. And at this point, I think I'd prefer just knowing straight up if she's not interested, rather than keep wondering.

So is it simple as:
Hey it's been a while, was wondering if you wanted to catch up over a sushi date on X at Y?

Is just throwing the word 'date' in there enough? 

What about 'hey cutie' or 'i always thought you were cute' to make it clear my intentions? Too much too soon?

28,qlv63d,1635948205,Help and moral support over an argument,"This always seems to happen - I (32M) am dating someone, everything seems fine, and then suddenly there is what I would see as a misunderstanding and a huge argument ends the relationship.

I personally HATE arguments. I will do everything I can to end it with at least one person happy and I will make sure that person is my partner if it can't be both of us. I will empathize, apologize, talk about what can be learned. Arguments do nothing for me.

I have been seeing a 31F for 3 weeks who seems just absolutely perfect in almost every way. Suddenly last night we were talking about pets and how she sees them as her children and I don't. I care about my cat but I just don't call it my child. It seemed like this wasn't OK with her because she kept asking about it and after a bit I just told her I felt like she didn't like my answer and was judging me. She told me I was putting words in her mouth and politely hung up.

I thought about letting it go but decided to text her and tell her I felt bad about how it ended and could tell she was upset. She said that I revealed ""a lot about myself in 30 seconds"" and that I put words in her mouth and that I was throwing off huge red flags - this just seemed so out of character to me to how she usually talks about me.

I tried very hard to express that I understood what I did wrong and that I could understand how she felt disrespected but it just seemed like there was nothing I could say or do. I barely slept at all last night and I'm miserable today. I texted her good morning and I said I would be giving her space today.

What do I even do. This is the most promising relationship I've had in the entire almost year and a half I've been dating. I hate this so much.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qlv63d/help_and_moral_support_over_an_argument/

But she is very friendly to me, and when we do talk we get along pretty well. I recently asked her if she wants to see the movie Eternals with me on Saturday, and go to dinner afterwards, to which she said that she‚Äôd love to. 
I am a freshman in college, but I‚Äôve never really had any romantic experience so far.

30,qlvdu6,1635948837,Income/wrath disparity and reciprocating gifts,"Gf of 4 months (31F) is incredibly kind and generous, she‚Äôs in a very unique position at the moment to have very minimal expenses (basically her only recurring expenses are food, phone bill, car insurance, internet and gas). She‚Äôs occupying a family members house for the foreseeable future rent free, owns her vehicle outright. She also has a couple sources of pretty solid reliable passive income, and has a lot of family money from some shared investments and properties which is doled out amongst the relatives frequently. I (34M) live comfortably and own a home and vehicle but work very hard, and don‚Äôt often have much ‚Äúextra‚Äù money for things like trips or big purchases. 

Gf is so sweet and often buys me things for around the house as she says she does spend a lot of time there. Also has gotten me clothes (she claims she‚Äôs the one who has to look at me lol), bedding (again, she has a vested interest in this too), food, etc. I tell her this is definitely appreciated yet also unnecessary and I don‚Äôt like feeling that I ‚Äúowe‚Äù someone. She insists it won‚Äôt ever be like that but I‚Äôve just not experienced this dynamic before so I‚Äôm in uncharted waters. 
Most recently I got surprised with tickets to go to a major metropolitan area (we are from a smallish town with a low cost of living) to go see a major spectator event. Don‚Äôt get me wrong- I am ecstatic! But this is not something I would have or even could have spent my own money on. The holidays coming up make me wonder how I can reciprocate this in some way. 


Anyone else ever feel like this? What did you do or say about it?

In the relationship itself I can honestly say there are zero problems compatibility or communication wise‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve each met a couple of each others family members and friends, sleep overs one place or the other more nights a week than not, etc. Literally everything is dreamy but this one aspect just has me a little squirmy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qlvdu6/incomewrath_disparity_and_reciprocating_gifts/
31,qlvfwe,1635949005,Can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs interested after first date?,"I (24f) went on a hinge date last night with a guy (27m). I had been talking to him for a few weeks last month on the app, then he didn‚Äôt respond for a while (like weeks). My last message to him was my phone number. Unexpectedly, the other day he texted me apologizing that he had gotten so incredibly busy the past few weeks he hadn‚Äôt checked the app but he just opened it and saw my number. He immediately asked me if I wanted to meet up for drinks. I told him yes and we met the next day. We had a great time, the conversation never lulled and I found that we had a lot in common. He also paid, which was nice. And he came out to my neighborhood to meet, which was also very sweet of him.

At the end of the night he walked me to my car which was very sweet as I didn‚Äôt park very close. However, I was a little thrown off because I was expecting a kiss but then he gave me a hug instead. It was extremely cold outside, so I know we both wanted to get home because we were standing in the freezing cold. I was shivering and I think he could tell. I still didn‚Äôt want to leave yet though! I was just so thrown off that he didn‚Äôt kiss me after such a good date. I hope I didn‚Äôt seem impatient by shivering and crossing my arms- I really was just super cold. 

He told me to text him when I got home so I did. I told him that I had a great time and that I had made it home. He responded saying he had a great time too. I responded a second time, saying I liked the bar we went to a lot and maybe we should do it again sometime and check out the bar next door (because when leaving our date he noted that the bar next-door looked pretty cool) and to have a good night. He then responded saying ‚ÄúYes ____ is a classic‚Äù (referring to the bar we went to.) Then said he‚Äôs heard the other bar is pretty electric. Then he told me he hopes I have a Goodnight as well. 

I didn‚Äôt respond to his last message Bc it was the end of the convo plus it was super late‚Ä¶

And now it‚Äôs the next day. So I guess I‚Äôm confused on two things 1) why he didn‚Äôt kiss me at the end of the date and 2) why he didn‚Äôt suggest a second date either on the date or when I texted him saying we should check out the other bar next time‚Ä¶ 

Should I just leave it for now and wait to see if he says anything else later this week? Or should I wait a couple days and message him suggesting meeting up again? I‚Äôve took a long break from dating so I‚Äôm not really sure how to handle this. I‚Äôm busy this weekend as I‚Äôm having minor surgery on Friday lol, so I don‚Äôt wanna text him too soon.

We‚Äôre both big on cuddling and now that it‚Äôs colder, enjoy it a lot more for warmth. 

I haven‚Äôt been sleeping well the last couple of weeks anyway so his snoring didn‚Äôt bother me as much as until last night, after a really hard workout. I wanted to SLEEP! I was a little excited when he said he had some work to finish so he might not stay the night because I knew I was going to want to sleep peacefully but after sex, we ended up cuddling and by then it was too late for him to leave. He spent the night. 

I kid you not at one point I dreamt there was a ghost in my living room that was making the noise but no, it was coming from behind me from my man. 

I asked him to turn his head the other way, and he complied. Then I told him that he‚Äôs snoring and so his head the other way makes sense. But somehow, at 4 am, his head was back my way in a cuddle and I couldn‚Äôt sleep again. 

I like him so much, I want to date him but I also want to sleep when I‚Äôm next to him.

39,qlwb7r,1635951558,"The painful feeling when two love each other, but cannot be together. Do you have a similar story? What happened to that relationship?","Welp I guess here‚Äôs my story. My mind is all torn up on this topic, I have so many conflicting feelings. But one thing I know is.. I‚Äôll never love someone like him again. And nobody will love like him again.

It was November 2016. We were highschool juniors, I was a mostly depressed loner kid who was so done with well, everything. This was before I met him. I can‚Äôt call when the first time we met, but I think a Japanese phrase‚Äî ‚Äúkoi no yokan‚Äù explains this beautifully; it‚Äôs when two people meet and you know that you two, will eventually fall in love with each other. This is exactly how I felt.. Fast forward nearly two weeks (at this point we were talking in school and text as well) I was running some errands for my mother, and we just randomly encountered each other. Spending the day together, he kissed me all of a sudden. And that was it‚Äîthis was how the most beautiful, magical fairytale 2 years have begun. I always reminisce of the time when we got bored in our prom so we ran away to play bowling when I see teenagers playing it‚Ä¶ we both hated prom but our family kind of forced us to go. And many, many more overwhelmingly beautiful memories he gave to me.

I thought it would last forever, I really did. Until the day we were separated to go different colleges. 2 months passed before it was obvious this wasn‚Äôt working. How can it work when we‚Äôve spent two long years together, almost seeing other every single day?

I (kind of forced myself to) date people, tried to enter into relationships but nothing was what we had. A couple failed and toxic short living relationships later I decided to abandon it all together. But, I knew that he himself was dating some others and he seemed happy‚Äîso I didn‚Äôt want to bother him. Maybe he was as miserable as me but I genuinely hope he isn‚Äôt. This feeling.. when your heart is longing for someone yet they aren‚Äôt there, maybe they have moved on already. It slowly burns your soul away, it sometimes get so unbearable that you desperately want to talk about it but the only person that can understand and give comfort, is not there anymore. Some days it gets so unbearable, you start to cry out of desperation. Thinking maybe someone will come and heal that wound, but knowing deep down that someone doesn‚Äôt exist.

Anyway now that feelings are out of the way‚Äîback to what made me begin to write this message. It was my birthday a couple days ago, and he called me to celebrate my birthday. To that point we‚Äôd chat occasionally but not so often. Well we talked about everything for about 5 hours. I know that he holds similar feelings for me. He admitted too that he never had found someone like me and that he doubts that he‚Äôd ever find, and here he was again, the human who I fell in love with, my best friend was there. I don‚Äôt even know, it was so beautiful so relaxing that I might have dreamt it lol. We really didn‚Äôt talk much after that.

And I desperately want to just call him and tell him everything, that we aren‚Äôt those teenagers anymore, that we can if we try, make it work, we are seniors, graduating next semester and have the chance, to possibly go to same city for graduate programs. I‚Äôm so confused and torn. I don‚Äôt want to distract or bother him so for now, I‚Äôm just holding my feelings back.

I‚Äôm not writing this post for advice on what to do, but rather I‚Äôm curious‚Äîdid you have a similar relationship? What is your story? How did it end?

54,qlxn5j,1635955328,Dating and Meeting People Online,"So I met this really nice girl and we both really liked each other online. We went out on a saturday for our first date for coffee and everything seemed to go well. We hung out for three hours just walking and talking and at the end I walked her back to the car and gave her hug. Personally it seemed like the both of us are trying to take things slow. What I mean is, like kissing and stuff like that. It‚Äôs more of were just trying to get to know one another before we dive all into this person. Also thought you should know that we are both Christians so we both believe in waiting before marriage. And she is 18 and I am 20, so we are young. 

Anyways, I told her after the date we should get back together again later next week. I didn‚Äôt call or text her because I was swamped with school and work. She then texted me in the middle of the week on a wednesday asking how I was doing. I texted her back and told her i was sorry for not getting back to her and told her I was just busy and stuff. We then planned another date for the next week on a Monday to see a movie.

So we went on our second date and saw the movie and had a great time. We talked after and we were both still passive about one another. I put my arm around her on the date and she was cool with it. But we talked after and I asked her if she needed to go home because it was around 8 o‚Äôclock at night, but she told me she could stay out longer with me. So then we went out to mcdonalds and got some food and we still had fun. After we went our separate ways and just gave a hug to each other. After I texted her later that night to see if she was okay and that she made it home safely and she did. I told her I had a great time and I look forward to Sunday with her. She said she had a great time as well and can‚Äôt wait either. 

&amp;#x200B;

So far this story sounds good and your probably wondering where this is going, now let me get to the part with why I‚Äôm questioning the whole thing. 

So we didn‚Äôt talk the rest of the week and she told me she was getting a new shift on our second date, that she was working night shifts. So that means her sleeping schedule is garbage because she works from 10 at night to 7 in the morning. So I texted her Saturday and asked how she was doing at work and she quite dry with her response say it was alright. I then asked if we were still a go for Sunday or are you to busy for that day. She told me she doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to work tomorrow and that‚Äôs all she said. And I was left scratching my head wondering if shes going be like, ‚ÄúBut next Friday works!‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt really ask to reschedule, I just said ok and nothing more after that. We haven‚Äôt talked for about 4 days now and she hasn‚Äôt rescheduled with me or even texted me. I only have her snap and I‚Äôve been posting Snapchat stories and she‚Äôs always the first to look at it. Not crazy or anything, but I thought it was interesting.

59,qlyu9u,1635958625,How do you get over making someone lose all their feelings for you?,"I met a guy on tinder a few years ago. We talked for a few weeks and went on a date. He lived any away from me and said that he usually doesn't drive that far to meet someone but that there was something about me. We held hands and made out on the date.

We had really good chemistry in person and over text. We told each other that we drove each other wild and he told me that he was falling for me, was obsessed with me, could see himself spending his life with me, and that he might be my perfect match.

But I got a little too clingy and needy when he said that it seemed like I didn't know if I wanted to be with him because I raised some concern about not knowing if we'd be sexually compatible because he seemed more sexual than me. He said that I acted crazy and made him lose all his feelings for me, and that he'd have to have sex with me to see if he could get them back. I didn't want to have sex with him so soon, so we went our separate ways.

I've tried to move on since then, but I'm finding it really difficult. It just really hurts to know that I had a really great guy who said that he was falling for me and obsessed with me, could see himself spending his life with me and might be my perfect match, and then I made him lose all those feelings he had for me and I wouldn't let him have sex with me to see if he could get them back.

I've gone on a few dates since then but I haven't found anyone that I had that same chemistry with, someone who liked me as much as he did, and I definitely haven't found someone as attractive as him.

61,qlyzge,1635958988,Met the woman of my dreams and her daughter law wrecked our relationship.,"I guess this is a cathartic post because nothing can be done.

&amp;#x200B;

8 weeks ago I was out on a Friday night in a bar I sometimes play music at. I wasn't playing that night. Just hanging out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I met a gorgeous woman there. We hit it off right away. She was monstrously attractive to me. She was a tad drunk but not overly so and she was sweating and I could smell her pheromones. She smelled so damn good Inwas entranced with her and apparently her with me. She dropped the guy she was talking to and came over to me and we spent the whole night together. She wanted me to take her home but I never do that on the first night I meet a woman as a test. I want to make sure they really like me and it's not just alcohol so I dropped her off and said I would text her next day.

&amp;#x200B;

That weekend and week we texted back and forth and chatted in the phone a couple times and we were so compatible it was mind blowing. By the next Friday we were so excited to see each other. We played it off like it was just 2 friends hanging out but that lasted about 3 drinks before we were acting like a couple and generally having a blast. Took her back to my place and we had the most mind-blowing sex imaginable. That pretty much sealed the deal. We agreed that while we weren't exactly exclusive we wouldn't sleep with other people for a minute and see where things went.

&amp;#x200B;

The next Friday we meet in same bar, missing each other all week. We got drunk, went home and never got out of bed all weekend. We bonded in every way a human can. 

&amp;#x200B;

The next weeks flew by. Picnics in the park, her coming to shows and seeing me play music. Every weekend we got deeper into each other. Completely smitten with each other.

&amp;#x200B;

So 2 weeks ago she asked me if I wanted to spend the weekend at her place so I could meet her mom, son and daughter in law and their 5 month old baby boy. Sure!

&amp;#x200B;

We had a great time together at her place, partied down all weekend and in Sunday her family came over. We all had a great time. I brought out my harmonicas and played for the baby who was completely entranced by my performance and the night ended with me going home having hit a home run with her family.

&amp;#x200B;

Then the trouble started. That Tuesday she called me for our usual nightly phone date and she started asking me strange questions asking if I ever was abusive. Of course not! My exes may have a lot of negative stuff to say about me but I know for a fact none would never claim I was abusive. Then I heard a phrase I was going to hear a lot over the next couple weeks. ""My daughter in law says..""

&amp;#x200B;

I was ""too perfect"", "" too kind"",""too nice"", ""45 and no kids/never married? Red flag!"", ""No visible flaws"",""musician out too much"", "" moving too fast"", ""something not right about him"". She showed her articles about men who are sweet and kind and generous to sucker the women in before becoming monstrously abusive and violent.

&amp;#x200B;

I had worked very hard to build trust and safety for her and all my work was being undermined. I googled my court records and showed her I had no violence in it. A few traffic tickets and a 12 yr old pot possession charge. I explained I was just a typical "" nice guy who finishes last"" and I just got lucky with her. But I could tell her trust was wavering.

&amp;#x200B;

Well Halloween weekend came and she was distracted all weekend. I knew what the problem was and tried to show her Inwas sincere. I took her to my childhood homes and showed her around town and gave her a moderately priced necklace. Nothing fancy, just a token. Things were otherwise pretty good. We planned for my birthday on the 2nd of Nov. I hadn't had a steak in months and I wanted to go to local steakhouse and eat. 

&amp;#x200B;

So 1st comes next day and we're texting at work and everything is fine. That night when she called me for our nightly phone date she's in tears and asks me if I know some woman. Nope, never met her. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Well she seems to know you."" and goes into some crazy tale that I supposedly dated this woman in 2007 and became violent and abusive towards her and her kids and her brother tossed me out and I stalked her for weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was completely shocked. I said I never met this woman I was with another ex in 2007 which she knew. She said the woman was the mother of a friend of her DIL.

&amp;#x200B;

I was crushed. I don't know this woman from anywhere and at worst she MIGHT have been a one night stand I ghosted the next day and forgot. But I certainly never acted like that. I had a clean record what more can she want?

&amp;#x200B;

So she said her DIL said in light of this ""evidence"" she cannot trust me around her baby and she would need to make a choice between the baby and me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Gf said she hated doing this to me but our relationship ""felt off"" and she just couldn't help wondering if I might be that way and her grandbaby was too important to take chances with and she decided she shouldn't see me anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I was crushed! I told her that all I ever did was bring love and joy into her household, never gave even a hint of violence. Never even showed the capacity for it. It didn't matter she said, her DIL and son will never accept me and her family is close and their opinion matters and even though it's cruel, it's unfair and wrong to hurt me like this it had to end.

&amp;#x200B;

I always said if the day came she asked to not see me anymore I would respect it and said goodbye and hung up. Then cried over my broken heart.

&amp;#x200B;

I gave her a day to process and texted her asking if she was sure about this and she stayed firm. Her kids would never accept me and she was firm. I told her she didn't dodge a bullet breaking up with me, just badly hurting a generous and soft hearted man who only had the best intentions. She said she was sorry to hurt me was firm in her decision.

&amp;#x200B;

So I lost the greatest woman I met in over a decade and I'm devastated by it. I did nothing wrong and never met this other woman. I just don't understand why this happened to me when I was nothing but good and kind and sweet and why did that work against me?

&amp;#x200B;

So I spent my birthday in a bar with a buddy and dropping tears in my beer. Sure sux to be me right now.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qlyzge/met_the_woman_of_my_dreams_and_her_daughter_law/

Initially, he claimed he wanted to pursue a long term relationship. But after a month, he later changed his mind after I confronted him regarding his true intentions. I ended up breaking it off with him (Feb 21) because I told him all he simply had to do was be honest. At that time , FWB was actually best for me due to my own circumstances. He was upset because of my choice. 

As summer passes, he will contact me sporadically but I‚Äôll ignore him. This past August we rekindled in the midst of him getting a new job and  mom dying. 

We agreed to keep it strictly FWB. But it‚Äôs not happening.

Planning for my birthday, we go on dates ...couple stuff. 

He recently expressed he really likes me , developed feelings for me, admires my drive , ambition, etc etc. I motivate him. He thinks I‚Äôm the type of woman he needs. I feel the same  way.  But when I asked him ‚Äúwhat are we doing?‚Äù He simply says he‚Äôs afraid of commitment.  

I told him today that I‚Äôm stopping all the extra activities we do, the physical and emotional intimacy , etc because it‚Äôs complicating things and I rather end it completely instead of being stringed along. Now he‚Äôs confused and keep questioning why???

Meanwhile, all of the actual genuinely sweet, awesome and down to earth guys and girls are constantly overlooked.

And I don't use Tinder, just wanted to clarify that. Never liked it to be honest! I already know literally almost nobody is looking for a genuine relationship over thereüòí",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qm0zgu/i_felt_defeated_so_i_gave_up_online_dating/

This just happened to me and to be honest it hurt a lot more than I thought it would.

86,qm126i,1635964721,Giving a small gift on the second date?,"I‚Äôm (25 f) going on my second date with a guy (27 m) on Saturday night this week. Our first date was a success and we immediately made plans to get to get her this weekend. 

During our first date he was telling me about the German Shepherd puppy he just got. I thought it was super cute how animated he got when he told me about the puppy. So today at the store I happened to see some chew toys for sale and I picked one up. 

What would you think of someone bringing something like this to your second date? Is it a little weird to bring a dog toy on a date? I was thinking of putting it in a little gift bag so he‚Äôs not carrying rubber bone around with him.

I asked her if she wanted me to leave and said no its fine. so we kept watching the movie. I asked her if we could kiss and she said yes but told me to put my hands away. while we were kissing I got horny and tried to grab her again and she got angry and told me to stop. I said I was really horny and that I needed to cum and she told me to just jack off so I pulled my pants down and started doing it, she was like wtf I meant in the toilet but I just kept going. I asked her if I could kiss her while doing it, she agreed... she even brought me a towel afterwards to clean up then we fell asleep. i went home the next morning, she seemed normal, not pissed or anything. we're still texting and making plans for this weekend so I think things are fine but I don't know. how normal is it for people to date for months and not have sex? if she was ok with sleeping next to me then she must have expectation that something was going to happen right? do you think theres some kind of problem here, I don't want to be pushy but I dont know what else to do I'm very confused.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qm19cq/ive_been_seeing_this_girl_for_3_months_now_and_we/

If you are going to tell me to just ask him out anyways without knowing his age, please just don't respond because I already know I can do that, I just want to see if it is even possible to predict someone's age based on limited information.

96,qm1yrh,1635967189,Am I the toxic one?,"So backstory- together for over a year and moved in together at the 9 month point. Throughout the relationship, things were never simple. He struggled with OCD so whether he was stressed about his ocd, or working 24/7, there was always other things he was worried about. His ocd was to do with cleanliness so I used to do everything to make sure I was as clean as possible, bring cleaning products to him, google ways to help him and I'd travel to clean his entire flat weekly before we lived together. He was also paranoid sometimes about my past and believed that due to me getting male attention before him, that I'd cheat on him and if I didn't respond to texts straight away, or if I didn't answer calls he would accuse me of cheating. I've never cheated on anyone and always been faithful. 
He was demanding in the sense of he wanted things done and them done now. He would ask for me to cook and to bake him things to take to his flat. He lived an hour away at this point and would call me at midnight and ask me if I could leave mine at 5am with the food to get to his for when he woke up. I'd do it everytime. I don't drive so I'd rather get cabs, or public transport. 
A couple of times I said no, and refused to do things for him, such as cook, or give him massages all the time, and he would quite simply just break up with me. 

Things got better in January after 6 months together, and in March he suggested renting a place together. We did this but straight away there was issues. He didn't like the rug I laid, didn't like how I done things. I rarely went out anywhere; but when I did it was constant calls asking when I'd be home. On his bday I arranged things to be delivered including presents and his favourite food, he went out with his friends instead. I was upset and packed a few clothes to go to my mums house. In anger, I threw a few of my clothes towards our kitchen. He was sitting by our window in the other direction and claimed I tried to assault him by throwing things. He called our estate agent, told them he was unsafe and needed to get out the tenancy as I was abusive. The agent called me and told me what he had said and told me she was sorry I was dealing with him and to get out ASAP before he ruined my life. 

I took him back, and on my birthday 1 month later he ended it with me when I asked him about a night out he was going on and he said he only got back with me after his bday for an easy life and was planning on leaving the tenancy at our 6 month break clause. He went out that night with condoms. The next day I was begging him to stay and apologising. I touched his arm to apologise and comfort him and he accused me of sexually assaulting him and told me I needed his consent. 

He moved out and I texted for days, begging him; pleading. Telling him how much I loved him. He said if I handed in my notice to leave the flat he would speak to me. I did that and then he still ignored me. He eventually blocked me. He came back a few days later, had sex with me and then accused me of trying to trap him into pregnancy, despite being on the IUD. He left again and after more begging he blocked me. 3ish weeks went by and he came back, same thing happened again and for the past 3 months we've been casually seeing eachother. He seems to be nicer these days and recently he's been very very affectionate and loving. I asked him about this and if he was feeling any different and wanted to get back together, and he turned on me and basically said we should stop seeing eachother, we're on a merry go round and that we need to move on. That same night he messaged and asked me where I was and if he could come over. I said no. 

He messaged a couple of days later basically saying he should've never asked to see me and he just wanted sex. He said we should stop speaking and that he will not be responding to any messages I send. And one of the reasons he doesn't want me is because I message too much and he's too tired to deal with me. 
I left it 4 days and messaged today asking how he is, as I do care for him. I said I am sorry if I'd made him feel any way or made him feel forced into seeing me. Asked him if he meant what he said and if he really wants nothing to do with me anymore.. and he ignored me. 
I messaged again and said if it's easier than responding he can just block me so I get the message and then that way I won't try anymore. And he's read it and ignored it and not blocked me. 

I'm so confused. But the more I think of it, the more I wonder if I'm the toxic one and I'm the reason why things are like this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qm1yrh/am_i_the_toxic_one/
