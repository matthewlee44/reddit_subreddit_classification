We initially started talking on a dating app in June, but I had started dating another guy which ended as a failed short term relationship. I reached back out to the guy on the same app at the beginning of July and the conversation picked up as if no time had passed. 

We met on a Friday and immediately hit it off, from dinner, to a walk in a park, to ice cream afterwards. Before heading to our respective homes, we planned to meet again on Sunday. We met at his place on Sunday and we went to a waterfront restaurant in DC (he had made a reservation!). We walked around the Kennedy Center and the Lincoln Memorial afterwards and took pictures together at the Lincoln Memorial. We went back to his place for ice cream and he said I was welcome to stay the night. I accepted (I know some would say that is too soon), but he was respectful of my boundaries and doesn't want to move the relationship too fast himself and I felt comfortable staying overnight. He provided breakfast the next morning (toast and assorted fruit) and I stayed till he had to go to work (he works for the Federal Government monitoring terrorists and has three different shifts he works over the course of four weeks, but that is a whole other story).

Before leaving on Sunday, we tentatively planned to meet on Wednesday, which he confirmed we could on Tuesday. On Wednesday, I went over in the evening after he got done with a church call and I got done volunteering with a local nonprofit organization. Before going out to get dinner, his sister called and he told me stay quiet. I guess he hadn't told his sister about me yet which I completely understand. After getting off the phone with her, we went to McDonald's (it was my suggestion since it was getting late and I'm completely ok with fast food as a late dinner option). We brought the food back and he started teaching me Backgammon (which was really fun once I learned it) and then his mom called. Again, he told me to be quiet. Then his mom asked him, ""I thought you had a date tonight?"" He said, ""I do."" And she asked, ""In person or virtually?"" He said, ""In person, do you want to say hi?"" It took his mom some convincing, but he eventually put the phone on speaker and his mom introduced herself and I introduced myself to her and he mentioned how we were playing Backgammon. She seemed to know I had cats and their names (Jedi and Leia), which means he has mentioned me and talked about me to her. His mom mentioned that cats, Star Wars, and Backgammon were three family themes, so I already have some things in common. It was implied that I was staying the night and since his shift for the week is 4pm-4am, we stayed up till 4am. For the rest of the night, I learned Beat Saber on his VR set and he introduced me to Among Us. He was happy and impressed that I tried three new things in one night.

The next day I stayed until the early afternoon before I left to go to a get together with some of my coworker friends. His parents had called him in the morning and after he called them back he said, ""Well, my parents know you spent the night."" Before leaving, we tentatively planned to meet up again Monday or Tuesday. Last night, he said we could meet Monday and skip a church meeting. He made that decision without me even asking. On Monday, he is going to meet my cats. He has two cats of his own.

All of this leads me to believe he is only seeing me and not talking to any other girls. Is this safe to assume that  we are exclusive?

We have been on 3 dates and I stayed over on the 3rd date. We text almost every day, laugh with each other, have similar values, and talk a lot about our families. On the second date we talked about what we were looking for, I said I wanted a relationship and he said he wasn’t necessarily looking for one but was open to it and hoped that that wasn’t a dealbreaker for me. His reason was because he is busy, I said that I certainly understand being busy and think at the end of the day it’s about communicating expectations and finding what works for the couple. When I said this his face lit up and he smiled and said “I agree, I like what you’re saying”. We haven’t had sex because I told him I don’t do casual sex and he has been respectful of that but we have done other things and have a lot of passion between us. 

As I continue seeing him, a concern that I have is that we will end up not wanting the same things out of dating each other. I really don’t want to base my interest on the possibility that he maybe will want a relationship. On our next date tomorrow I’m planning on being straight up and telling him that I find him a little hard to read and don’t know what his plans are with me. I will say that I don’t want to get emotionally invested in someone who doesn’t have the same goals as me down the line. My concerns about this though are that I don’t to put too much pressure on him. I’d like to continue seeing him and by no means want to define our relationship anytime soon, but I just want to remind him of what I’m dating for and make sure he knows that.

Some of these I should probably address first.

I haven't done anything with anyone ever. Not even holding hands in the non-euphimistic sense. I was out of high school before my equipment started working and I've barely socialized since. Worse, their sex ed was abstinence only and I haven't done anything to educate myself. I don't even watch porn. I probably know less about sex than the average 11 year old does. Suggestions on what to read/listen/watch there (other than porn) would be appreciated as well.

I don't have any friends either.  I don't have any social phobia or anything like that, I've just preferred to be alone until now. I did have two different 5 year roommates in my 20s, so I couldn't have been that unpleasant to be around, but neither ever became friends. 

My family is dysfunctional and meeting them or possibly even talking to them is not going to happen. They aren't willing to have any meaningful conversation with me as it is. I was pretty much left to take care of myself and figure things out on my own from age 10 or 11. 

I have never had a job. I have always been skillful at making more than enough to get by without much effort. One example is retail flipping while churning.

I used to be a gamer, but now my only hobby is reading books.  I'm also very skilled at laying in bed and doing nothing at all. I am pretty adaptable to new activities. I just don't enjoy doing most activities alone.

I'm not particularly attractive in a general kind of way, rather than some specific flaw. Some of this probably can't be fixed, but some of it can. For example, I'm overweight, but I'm working on it. I've lost 30 pounds so far. I'm also trying to do something about my 10"" arms. 

I do have a nice apartment, but it is pretty minimalist.

This is especially difficult in bigger cities where male femininity is preferred. It seems that all of my conversations end up super dry, I always show interest in who I’m talking to but it never gets reciprocated.

We are designed to be attracted to them but the process of obtaining one is utterly insane. I'm 24 now and there's been a total of 3 girls that liked me but I didn't find them attractive. I don't want to sound like a dick but they were all overweight and unattractive. I'm over 6 feet tall, fit (used to be a boxer) and according to other guys like my friends and older people, I'm apparently good looking. However, when it comes to attractive girls, they act like I don't even exist and sometimes are even rude to me.

I find it really easy to make guy friends and even speak to some girls that aren't attractive since they're usually nice but when I meet an attractive girl at work or anywhere, they're usually stuck up ass holes. I find it extremely difficult to even speak to them but then I see a fat dude walking around with a hot girl and I'm just thinking what the fuck, it just doesn't make any sense, it's almost as if I'm living in the matrix. Perhaps those guys are rich, or have a certain social status that I won't ever.

I tend to fap a lot, 3-5 times a day sometimes more on weekends when I'm not working.

Cold approach is ridiculous, I tried it once, approached around 7-10 girls on campus when I was in university once and got rejected by all, some were even weirded out, never tried it again lol. Nowadays it's funny and almost even a hobby getting rejected by random girls on tinder or in other areas of my life.

SO I have been depressed for 2 years. I'm fine now.  
trying to rebuild my life. Loosing weight ( I got really fat ). Moving back to my home country to start new life. And pandemic hits. The only skill I have ( film industry ) is highly dependant on people you know. My second skill ( chef ) is not faring me much better.  
So I got stuck at home with parent , with little income. I'm 38.  


Being bored I start playing with Tinder. And there is houndreds of converstaions that goes nowhere.

And now I met a girl. She is great . We chat few hours everyday past 2 weeks.  
At first I was not in town due to filming documentary, but I dont feel like I'm ready to meet her, so I lied that work will take 3 weeks. And time is comming. She is to way to good for me now. I can sort my life in 6 months. I lost 40 pounds last year. 30 more to go. I'm vaccinated and can start working more.  
So I need to tell her something ( a LIE ) that will give me that few months. And I don't believe in destiny and that kind of BS. It's not gonna be ok. 38 unemployed fat looser doesn't have chance.

I hadn’t asked her to be exclusive yet or pressured her and it was out of the blue. Her child was sick, she started her period, and perhaps I wasn’t attentive enough toward her needs that one day as I wanted to share the news of a possible promotion and a real estate investment deal.

Since then the conversation has all but died. I in a way feel lied to but understand she needs time and space.  I feel confused, torn between giving her the space she says she wants and fighting like hell for her. And can’t seem to find the perfect balance I feel like.

I’ve been seeing this guy for over a month and we’re both really into each other. Our situation is a little complicated because he’s leaving for his last year at uni and will be about 800 miles away in September, so right now we’ve agreed to be casual and will reassess the relationship at the end of the summer to see if we want to stay in touch noncommittally while we’re in school.  

The prior 2 dates in terms of physicality were make outs and a little second base but no mention of sex (this was about a month in). On our fourth date, he got to third base with me but I’ve never had sex before so I was too nervous to initiate anything with him. 

I haven’t told him that I’m a virgin but plan to on our next date this weekend because obviously he deserves to know. He’s legitimately a great human being and I wouldn’t mind him being my first but he’s leaving and I think that would emotionally crush me if we had sex because there’s just not a ton of certainty in our relationship. 

Lately, we’ve been getting more intimate and flirting in a vague but sexually charged manner…and I can’t help feeling like I’m withholding information from him. 

I want to have sex with him but know I shouldn’t, and I also don’t want to give him the wrong impression. I know it’s normal to begin getting more intimate and sexual at this stage, but I, immaturely, don’t want him to leave if he finds out my boundaries (even though this is totally an insecurity thing on my part, I don’t think he’ll do this). And I want to talk to him about it in person but don’t want to come off as dishonest/or teasing without intent over text. 

Would just love some perspective on this

I’ve been dating this girl for a couple months now, her past relationship lasted a couple years and it was super toxic so before jumping into a new one right away we took our time but I knew we both really liked each other a lot also we are coworkers as well. So I was intent and told her to tell me when she wants to start dating so I know your ready to make it official. Well a month or so into talking she asked me out and I asked her a couple times if she was for sure ready to become a item, she replied yeahs she wouldn’t of asked if she wasn’t ready so we started dating. Everything is going super good we met each other’s parents fairly early on but we knew we both really like each other. We spend tons of time together either at my place or hers, sleep overs you name it but we’d always see each other. Most of the time I was always asking when’s the next time we will see each other and she would tell me or I’d spring it on her and she’d come over but seemed very into it and happy at the time. There would be sometimes where should would surprise me to and ask me to come over which I liked a lot too. I’ve already worked up to say I love you to her but she didn’t say it back which I’m okay with in due time I’d hope. We share a lot together and are very open with each other but as of recently we had a rough spot where I told her how I felt about being stressed and we went a whole day without talking about it anything happen, I’d always check in and ask if she’s okay and she would say she is so I didn’t think anything of it but I had a gut feeling something was wrong and I had to be honest with about how I feel or I’ll feel like this throughout the whole relationship, we agreed it’s a 2 way road when it comes to things like this. So yesterday I talked to her and she wanted to talk to me too cause something was clearly off about us. She told me she needs space and she felt she didn’t wanna keep this going but she said she really likes me and it hurts her knowing where I’m at in the relationship and it’s not fair to me that I’m saying all these things like I love you to her and she doesn’t know if she can say it back right now or soon she just doesn’t know. She scared about her future and what she wants to do and said she feels she can’t keep expecting me to always be there for her when she can’t be there for me. She been putting off all these things causes hang out a lot and she can’t say no to me, she’s scared and doesn’t know what to do or how to tackle things she wants to do, she said she always says to her self “ oh I’ll do that this day or that but then we hang out and she puts to the side, so she said she thinks it’s best to go on her own. I understand people needs personally time and we can’t always hang but I can’t help but wonder if some of those things can be done while I’m there I’d assume they could but maybe I distract her to much for her to do them. Then said she didn’t wanna throw what we have away and be so impulsive and try to work it out. Hearing all this and not expecting really had me but I knew how much I love this girl and if it means I have to part ways with her and it makes her happy then I was all for it cause I don’t wanna be with someone that is only wanting to be with me cause they know it’s hurt the other person. I can live with that guilt this far into my life. If it’s not meant to be it’s not meant to be end of story yeah I love her but sometimes we’re not afraid of falling in love we’re afraid of being loved back. So I laid it all on the line told her how I feel if it doesn’t work it don’t work but at the end of the day I’m leaving the relationship as a changed person. I told her how I felt and that I could see that we do hang out a lot and could understand that she needs to be able to do stuff by her self and for me to not always chase her but have her chase me cause she was very agreeing with that about if I let her make plans it helps her be able to do things and not feel tied down to put things.She then told me I hate to go back on this but I wanna work it out with you. It’s probably easy to say okay and not think twice about jumping back in but like I said if you don’t want me because you truly want me then it’s not worth my time to invest in it period. So I flat out said don’t just jump back into cause that’s how I feel about you, don’t let it hinder your decision. So I asked if you truly wanna work this out and become stronger? I asked 7 times if she was sure and every time she said yes I’m sure I wanna try to work this out ! So just before I left I asked one thing “ are we on the same page now ?” She replied yes I said be serious with me and she later replied I know we are! So that brings us to today and I’ve seen some good small strides in changes as in texting but the true test is what’s ahead and all I can do is take day by day.

Hard to read the signals that are being given off.

So I (25M) broke up with my ex (19F) three weeks ago. It wasn't supper messy but it was messier than it should have been. After reflecting over the past three weeks I realized where I went wrong and apologized for my part in the break up (I was being needy and overbearing). It was long distance but the break up was very abrupt as our whole relationship was incredibly positive up until the last two weeks where we just not understanding each other and she pulled the plug literally right before I was going to. I still love her and the breakup was very avoidable. So I sent this long text taking blame in where I went wrong and said ""I am not trying to win you back I just need to get this off my chest"". She replied apologizing for her part as well and said that she really missed talking to me and wanted to at least be friends. The past two days we have been texting back and forth a bit. Not to the level of when we were together but we've been joking asking each other what they are up to etc.. For me, it has been hard to read the signs. For one, after the breakup I blocked her on my socials which she said hurt her feelings. So the other day after we reconciled a bit I added and requested her back but she didn't do the same to me (except for snap). In addition, she used a heart emoji yesterday after a text which she immediately edited to a laughing emoji. Additionally, I am going to be in the town she lives in 2 weeks (it has been long distance), and I said we should get coffee or dinner and she replied ""if I am in town yes I can"". The issue is that the signals we have been sending off to each other have both been very mixed. I am trying to keep it cool and understand it may require some time to build back a trust but it is killing me to know what we are going to do moving forward. We both clearly still like each other but I want to know if we can try again. I can't tell if it is just neither of us wants to take the first move, if she is skeptical, or if I am the only one who still has feelings for her.

Last Sunday I went on a “date” with a work colleague of mine. We met at work, after working with me 3 times he asked if we “wanted to get some drinks together”. The following days he texted me, we talked for about a week through text and then met up. We have not talked once since the date happened. 

Now to the actual point here.. at work, he only saw me working in a mask. When he texted me however, he saw my profile picture which was a selfie of me and I also sent him some selfies during the convo so he kinda had a plan what I looked like beneath that mask. Of course, he had never seen me in 3D without the mask, so yeah, I’ll give him that. Tbh, we didn’t click through texting at all. I don’t think he’s funny and for me it would’ve been mainly sexual, idk if he’s about that life, anyways. The date was awkward, I was acting very awkwardly bc I was nervous and felt insecure and overall it felt unnatural. But over text he seemed interested in me. At work we couldn’t talk too much usually.

I cant shake the feeling though, he “ghosted” me because he thought I was ugly. I’ve felt like shit all week, feeling unattractive and disgusting because I can’t help thinking about it. I just wonder if I do look so gross without a mask. I probably do.

So for reference I’m gonna link my previous post about this situation at the bottom of this post. I started to write this last night, I’m calmer and more level headed rn but I feel like it’s all gonna hit me again soon. I’d (23F) been talking to this guy (27M) since the end of February/beginning of March. It took us a little while to actually meet up but we finally went on our first date towards the end of April. 

We went to a bar and drank and talked for hours. It was literally perfect. He asked me if I’d wanted to hang out again in a few days. I’d said yeah and we went to the movies and had a good time but then we kinda got into an argument towards the end of it. After that he kinda ghosted me for a while but he’d still been on my mind since then because everything just felt so unfinished. 

I took it upon myself to mute him on everything because at that point we had each other on all social media platforms. I would still see likes/comments sometimes on mutual friends posts because we know some of the same people cuz we went to the same high school. Other than that though it’d been out of sight out of mind for the most part until he started being a little active on my posts at the end of June/beginning of this month. He would react to or comment on like half the things I shared. 

He started off doing it gradually so I didn’t really try and take it as anything other than him being friendly but he had really ramped it up recently so I decided to bite the bullet and message him finally. He mentioned how I’m a little sarcastic and it was hard for him to tell when I’m joking or not, which I’ve gotten my whole life but I didn’t think I was doing that with him. But I apologized for it not having come across as intended. Then we got deeper into it and he admitted that he felt as though as I was dating multiple people where as he only dates one person at a time and he got insecure. 

It kills me because I genuinely don’t do that and was only focused on him the whole time and I’d thought I’d made that clear. He felt as though he wasn’t in his rights to ask me if I was only dating him, etc; etc; We kinda left the convo in a neutral place although he did throw out a couple feelers it seems now that I’m looking back at the convo concerning us giving it another shot but I missed them at the time cuz I was just concerned with communicating my feelings after not having talked for a while. I know he has his flaws and I’m not putting him on a pedestal or anything but we just have so much in common and we have the same worldviews on a lot of things even down to being child free. 

I feel like right now he might feel a little rejected because I didn’t really acknowledge anything about us moving forward except for telling him that it was up to him because I don’t wanna pressure him. I was planning on reaching out to him again on Sunday to let him know that I’d be down to try again if he is but now I’m conflicted and I don’t know if I want to anymore or if it’s worth it. I fell for him hard and was put through a rollercoaster of emotions over some miscommunication and misunderstandings. 

Part of me feels like I should keep trying cuz I genuinely only want (ed?) him and I felt a strong connection but at times it felt like I was the only one fighting for it. Because the way I’m looking at it is that if it were me on the other end I would’ve communicated and tried to fix the issues. I also feel like I might be overcompensating because I’ve been told in all my previous relationships that I’m too cold and uncaring and I just wanted to actually make efforts for this one because I do really like him.

Topic and adjacent topics come up on a few other occasions, seemed VERY odd for someone to be so open about it but I kinda admired it. Bit of a red flag that she apparently just kinda flips a switch and blocks out any emotion regarding that stuff, or just detaches herself from triggering things, never went to therapy or anything. I've got my own baggage that I've spent years working on too, we all handle it differently, I'm not one to judge.


 I decided to keep talking to her and get to know her better. We went out a few more times, things were fun. Then one day in the car after lunch I open up a bit about some touchier parts of my past too, how I've done a lot of work on myself since (lots to be done still obvs), and she has since ghosted me.

This time I got back on Tinder we really hit it off, we were talking non stop, it felt natural, he made me laugh, and we had so much in common. We went out on some really amazing dates. I was so tired of going out to eat on dates but with him we would do fun stuff like go to arcades or go to drive in movies. Everything was literally perfect and it was going steady for a month. Then I noticed he started taking longer to text me back but he would still reach out to me first but I didn’t think anything of it because it wasn’t everyday he would take hours to respond. But I noticed that he didn’t seem as anxious to hang out like he did before. I work 6 days a week at 2 different jobs so any time I had I would spend with him. He seemed really supportive and helpful and offered to help me move into my new apartment. I felt like we were really connected. Our last date was on Saturday last week and we went on a hike and when he got in the car he didn’t seem excited to see me but when we got to our hike we had a good time and he was being affectionate. After the hike we went out to eat and then he said he wanted to go home and change since we had been hiking all day and he wanted to pick me up afterwards but after his shower he texted me and told me he was tired so I didn’t have a problem with it because I didn’t ask him if he was still coming over.

I was open and vulnerable to him because in the past I’ve been so guarded. But my only thing was if you weren’t interested why didn’t you just tell me that? I told him what he did was hurtful and he could have let me know that he wasn’t interested and I left it alone and never got a response back which I expected I most likely wouldn’t get a response.

I am new here and this is my first post. so if i have ignored a rule or something don't kick me out :&gt; Please don't discard this as madeup story as it is long and dramatic coz i really don't have anyone to talk to about this. I am not from US/Europe. If anything in this post seem inappropriate, please forgive me and let me know so i can remove or edit. i hope this gives some context.

I'm 23 Male, working in a huge MNC. I have a crush on a girl on my team also same age as me. We joined on the same day so we got to  talking from day 1 (fav. things, cracking jokes) . She'd ask me any computer / technical stuff &amp; i will ask her all my work related doubts. I was surprised to know that someone other than me had similar taste in movies, sitcoms.

Then the social life killer Covid hit the world and we were sent home packing with laptops and headsets to start work from home. (any convo from this point on is in text due to WFH). Few months later me and some of my team got bumped up to a new team and guess who was also there. yes, it was her. since we are in transition to a new team, we have a lot of time to talk (via text). Now we talk almost all the time commenting about what is being said in meetings, helping with doubts regarding work and make fun of team leaders or teammates. I think this is the point where i realized that i'm having a crush on her. She'd laugh at all my dumb jokes (looking at it in hindsight). she'd always reply instantly (unlike my college ""crush""). She seems to be interested and understand about things i say. She'd pick me out of 14 others in group activities (she'd slip in the we can team-up ""if you want""). I haven't entered the ""doing things to impress her"" phase yet but i can see me doing coming sooner or later.

Generally (there are exceptions ofc) women don't go around saying things like ""hey x i think i like you"" and are not expected to. so it's up to me to decide whether she is interested in me. Im a shy person (as if asking relationship advice on reddit wasn't a giveaway). I haven't had any relationships before (not uncommon in my culture) and since i work in an MNC, if i misjudged her interest in me and ""made a move"" that'd be end of my time at my job which i come to like very much and pays good. We haven't talked anything about our personal lives. Like every teenager ever i have started dreaming about my future with her. I think i should not let this distract me and possibly cause her a lot of headache if it is just my brain creating feelings out of thin air.

My Questions to the people who have read this far are the following:

1. Am i just dreaming stuff or is there something of potential here?
2. How do i know if she is really interested in me now that we are not seeing each other in person due to WFH?
3. What should i do or not do if she is interested in me?
4. What should i do or not do if she isn't interested in me?

If you have any suggestions/advice for me that can't be displayed on comments, you are welcome to Private message me.

Things were going very well the first few dates. Lots of fun and banter. Lots of heavy petting at my place. And some oral sex. No penetrative sex yet though. 

In between dates we would FaceTime a bunch. We wouldn’t really be texting all day but maybe once or twice a day with a goodnight video call just to catch up on our days. 

This girl would drop some hints about long term potential. We had a conversation about us, and she said that she’s really optimistic about us and that I check all her boxes. She told her family about me. She says she wants to travel everywhere with me. When we were out at a restaurant she called me “her man.”

One day we were talking about kids, and she dropped the comment that she thinks about what our babies would look like. So that night I looked into her eyes and told her that I wanted to put one inside her. I also asked her to be my girlfriend but she said not yet, but assured me that she’s not seeing anyone else. I pushed the envelope too far that night and I think she got scared. Or maybe I just came off as desperate. 

Since that night (last weekend) we haven’t talked much at all. I texted her Monday if she wanted to meet (today is Friday), and she said she’s really busy. And more importantly she said we’re moving way too fast. She said she wants to learn more about me but not close our selves off to other options. 

After that I decided to completely ice her. She reached out to me two days ago asking how my day was, and she told me a story about work that day, in a very cheery tone completely opposite to the serious tone during the conversation we had when she said we were moving too fast. I replied and spoke politely but did not try to continue conversation. Since then we haven’t spoken at all.

Please help.

Some advice on my situation would be greatly appreciated...

I (M32) started talking to this girl (F31) mid-April and immediately we had great chemistry. Our first date was at a park and went great. Since then we have been talking and connecting on the phone almost every day and we had been making plans to see each other once a week. I am living in Toronto so our covid restrictions are just lifting. With that being said all of our meet ups since the first date have been her coming over to my place (we did go on 2 hikes in this period). We would chill out, talk for a bit, cuddle, and it would eventually always lead to sex. My problem is that I am absolutely crazy about this girl, I could see a long-term relationship with her but my clouded sex-crazed male mind has been making me skip a lot of important steps that any girl would like to experience during the courting period and in fact the entire relationship.

Since we hang out only once a week and I am trying to stay monogamous, my sex drive and desire for sex when with her is very high. We hung out last Monday and again.. I of course, wanted to connect with her physically and have passionate sex. I thought things went great but got a phone call from her yesterday saying that ""our physical connection is amazing but I feel bad when I am with you otherwise because you don't treat me like someone is special. You treat me like your prostitute."" You never ask me out on dates, we haven't talked on the phone in a week, you never try to walk me home or pick me up from my place to go to yours"". She also said that she thinks I only care about sex and am not fully present or excited to do anything else when sex is on my mind.

The weird part like I said is that I am actually crazy about this girl and would do anything for her. Especially showing up better and making more of an effort to be like a loving-boyfriend. I am honestly one of the most loving and caring guys when it comes to people I date but the internet these days teaches guys to play it cool and not over pursue in the beginning. It has definitely back-fired on me. I admit I was blind to these things she brought up and thought they would all eventually start to happen naturally but she feels like I am just using her. Anyway, she basically told we want different things and we probably shouldn't see each other anymore. We ended up talking for 2.5 hours on the phone and started to makeup but she still insists on taking time to process what I said as well as her feelings. I genuinely think she has strong feelings for me and I hurt her badly by not showing up 100% and giving her my full love.

I'm twenty and I've never had a boyfriend. Or have been confessed to.

I've been breaking down over this since I was seventeen because I felt so ugly and so difficult to love. When I was eighteen, i
I had a confusing long-distance fling with a guy I met here on Reddit who treated me like a doormat, and I stayed because I had no self-esteem. I was scared that if I let go, no guy would ever take his place. I met guys whom I liked that I didn't make a move on, or simply ignored, because I was too insecure to shoot my shot.

I am twenty now. My relationship with my friends are good. I have everything in order. My skin is clearer and my clothes fit better. I am not single because I'm ugly. I am okay-looking, but I'm outgoing and I'm perfectly capable of carrying conversations with people. I'm generally interesting. I have shortcomings of my own, and I am still deeply insecure at times, but I'm relatively well-adjusted.

I am single because by the time I started respecting myself enough to know that I was not unlovable, it was during lockdown and I didn't have the same opportunities to meet anyone. I regret not making any moves on guys when I had the chance, but it's all behind me now and it's still not too late. I am so, so young.

There are days when I think about the fact that I've never had a boyfriend, or that no man has ever made any real moves on me, and it hurts a lot. There are days when I think I should start sleeping around just to know what it's like to be wanted by a man. I cannot have these thoughts anymore. I am fine. I just have to be patient. Eventually I'll be able to go out again, and meet people again. This time around I won't hesitate anymore.

For now, I'll focus on trying not to attach my self-worth to how willing men are to give me attention. I am fine. I am okay. I'll work hard. I'll meet a great guy.

I’m 21 and ive had 3 what I would call serious relationships each lasting at least 4 months with the longest being nearly a year. 

In all of those relationships I feel like I have so much for them and to make them happy and got little in return. 

I know relationships aren’t transactional and most important thing love and mutual respect but I just constantly felt like I was doing the all work in the relationship.

In the dating phase I was asking them out, buying flowers, buying dinner and lunch and paying for whatever we did, did all the planning driver and all that, while all they did was show up and maybe sleep with me. Then little changed into the relationship, except I started having to buy gifts and more stuff. 

Any magic that happened was my doing. I don’t think I have ever received a gift that wasn’t sexual in nature. I’ve never had a girl ask me to meet her for dinner or lunch or ever had a girl pay for a meal. Even after nearly a year together if we were going out to eat I was paying 100% of the time.

Look wise, the people aren't really close to them and they are probably nice people, but look wise they are just unattractive as all gets out. 

So why do men and women have so much confidence when asking out attractive men or women?
