 A Friend asked a girl out when he saw her at a dancing class for the first time and she said ""no i am not interested"" so he responded ""come on, i am asking you for a coffee not a big thing"" and she said yes. Later when they started dating she told him she was intrigued when he did that like what is this guy who responded like that! Who is he? Now i am interested to know more. Well, they dated for 6 months but didn't work out later,she ended it as they realized they are different.   

On the other hand here is another story. A man in TED said he asked a girl out a d she said no so in his mind he interpreted it as may be the lighting was bad, may be she had a bad day? He chased her and  asked again and ended up marrying this women. The Ted talk was a about confidence btw.

So it is a mixed bag. I know it is individual. So here is one of mine. I approached a girl on a dating app, she didn't respond. I tried again with a better message picking on one of her interests so she responded. Then she went silent. I upped the game and said something funny and creative, she laughed and responded yet she went silent again. I upped it more and then we start talking and she give me her phone number. we talked for 3 hours first time and then fir a few days. She went silent again and i gave up. The same story happened with another girl and we ended up dating for a while. 

My question to girls: when is persistence appreciated and interpreted as confidence and someone who knows his value  and when it is looked upon as creepiness?

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of women here and in general get hated on when they complain about their (online) dating struggles. Because, why are you complaining when you get so many chances, matches and opportunities? But what girl friends of mine complain about is giving everything to guys they meet on tinder, only to be tossed aside, have them dissapear etc.

I was one of those people who hated on it. I do not get a lot of matches and even fewer dates, have had boring dates etc. But one of those matches went great. We matched in december, talked and talked, flirted and discussed deep stuff for a few weeks. We met during lockdown at my place, got drunk, made out, slept together. We had sex in the dark, which was the most passionate night i have ever had even counting my best relationships. Afterwards and in the morning we cuddled almost like a new couple.

We talked about that we would like to see where this goes and were into each other. I jumped for joy and even thanked God and fate for this gift despite being not so religious. I had finally met someone since my ex that was completely my type. This was only for her to fade away and become ""emotionally unavailable"" a few weeks later around mid january.  I was stressed out for months. I asked her if she wanted to be my valentine and she asked ""uhm, why?"". When i confronted her around march, she had already been with other guys. It was only until a few days ago that i thought ""maybe we can one day get back together"" because she also said that that was possible. But what changed my mind was me drunk texting her and her saying that it was a bad time for all of us (lockdowns) and we just used each other for some warmth, comfort and affection. So to her it really did not mean a lot apparently. She said she had tried relationships in the past months (with other guys, not with me) but it just didn't work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never want to go through that again.

First off I’m a single dad of a six year old little girl. My daughter’s mom is not in the picture and hasn’t been since my daughter was very young. I first met this woman (I’ll call her Vanessa) back in early 2019. Both of our daughters were in the same preschool class. We met on a day when they had parents who have different careers come to school. I’m a letter carrier and Vanessa is a nurse so the teacher tasked us to be two of the parents who came in to talk to the class.

We chatted for a while in the hallway outside the classroom. I thought she was really pretty and very nice. We talked for a while and and discovered that our daughters were friends. Her daughter is a little girl my daughter would always talk about after school and vice versa.

I saw Vanessa again at the little graduation ceremony they held for the preschoolers. I was there with the woman I was dating at the time and she was there with her husband. We said hello to each other and hoped the girls would be in the same kindergarten class.

I didn’t see Vanessa again until late 2020. I was able to get a mail route in the same suburb that we live in. It turned out that Vanessa lives on the last street on my route. I would see her from time to time getting home from work and we’d talk for a bit.

I learned that she had gotten a divorce and by that time I was single too. In May of this year I was delivering her street and she was outside doing some yard work. It was warm enough that I was wearing a polo shirt and shorts. When Vanessa saw me she said something like “Damn, I didn’t know you had all those tattoos.” She sort of looked at me differently than she had before. Later when I had a day off she asked the lady who fills in for me if I was single. She also told her that she has a weakness for white guys with beards and tattoos.

So I knew she was into me but I have a rule about dating people from work: don’t do it. Even though she was talking coworker she’s still a customer and I felt like if things didn’t work out it could get awkward. We have continued to talk a few times a week and out conversations have gotten pretty flirtatious. I’ve resisted the temptation to just say fuck it and ask her out anyway. I think she’s a real knockout, funny, and really nice.

Last week I found out I have gotten a new route. One of my coworkers retired and I put in a bid for his route since it’s a really good one. I ended up getting it. I was so happy to get a great route it didn’t immediately dawn on me that I could probably ask Vanessa out since I wouldn’t be her mail carrier anymore.

I told her on Monday that I wouldn’t be delivering to her much longer and she seemed pretty disappointed by it. I intended to wait until the last week on my route to ask her out. Well yesterday I was working super late. I didn’t deliver her street until after 7 pm and it was a torrential downpour.

When I got to her house and went up on the porch to deliver her mail she came to the door and said “You poor thing! Why are they making you work so late?” I told her we’re pretty understaffed right now. She asked how late I was working and I said until about 8.  She asked who was watching my daughter and I told her that on weekends in the summer she usually stays with one of my sisters or brothers so she can spend time with her cousins. Vanessa told me her daughter was with her dad for the weekend.

Then she asked if I had eaten dinner yet. I said I hadn’t. So she asked if I’d like to grab a late dinner with her. Her treat for me being such a great mailman! I was immediately like “Yes. I’d love that.” I asked if she was sure she wanted to eat so late and she said she didn’t mind. When I finished up my route I went back to her house and we exchanged phone numbers.

After work I went right home and showered and changed. I didn’t even have time to be nervous. I called Vanessa to tell her I was on the way and went and picked her up. We only live about ten minutes from each other. She picked out a good Chinese restaurant for us to eat at. 

All told it was a really nice dinner. We talked a lot about being single parents and the dating scene. Finally she asked me why I hadn’t asked her out. I gave her my reasons and she said she thought that might be the reason. As we were finishing dinner I asked if I could treat next time. (Hoping there would be a next time!) She said yes of course. 

Then I asked if she wanted to get together Saturday night (tonight). She said she’d love to but it would have to be a late dinner again since she was working today. So now I just got off work and I’m typing this up. I picked out a Puerto Rican restaurant for us to go to. Vanessa is Puerto Rican so I think she’ll appreciate that.

Despite this being a *huge* age difference, nobody really has anything negative to say about it and my friend(39F) even says she thinks they are cute together. Tbh, big age differences don't bother me personally, but I can't help but notice the double standard. If the genders were reversed, it would be considered grooming. Even I, a super young looking 33 year old, don't think I can get away with dating a 22 year old. In fact, this particular guy derided another guy(38M) as a ""groomer"" for dating girls in their late 20s. 

Unfortunately, I feel like this double standard has unconsciously rubbed off on me. Honestly, a young guy(even a teen) dating a much older woman comes off to me as exciting and fulfilling for both parties. Meanwhile, an older man dating a younger woman automatically registers in my brain as imbalanced and maybe even domineering. I don't consciously think this, but it's just my automatic feeling. And because of this, I can't help but feel undesirable because of my age and envy guys who are younger and have the opportunity to have fulfilling and exciting relationships with older women. Yeah sure I can still date older women technically, but it's not like at 23, where I could enjoy that dynamic with hot women in their 30s. To emulate that dynamic now, I'd basically have to go for women over 45-50, and even then it's not quite the same since I'm ""mature"" now. When I compare it to that experience I could be having if I was younger, dating just seems to bland and pointless right now. It's sad, because I'm matching with lots of women around my age and a bit younger and older on dating apps whom I feel very little excitement about but can't help but think of how much more exciting it would be if I was matching them as a 23 year old.

Recently one of my friends (that hangs out with her) told me she's still pretty in to me. After days of nervousness I finally texted her, asking her on a date for upcoming monday.

I  have a 3 story 5 bedroom house and I live in it alone. 


I've had a couple ""serious"" relationships that ultimately failed. All I want in life is someone loyal, good looking with a career and a brain. I'm on dating apps, I've hired professional match makers (paid well over 10k for this), been on 20-30 first dates, and still single. 


My concern is that I'm growing resentful. For example, I feel less bad for a girl in an abusive relationship than I used to, because I feel like that's what girls want. I've had many girls tell me they're attracted to a**holes and then expect me to feel bad for them.

Okay.  Rant over. Are there still decent women out there that want to be spoiled, are loyal, and want a serious, anxiety free relationship, who don't have any kids or serious issues? Seriously asking. If yes, what are you looking for that we're not providing?

Hi everyone, i’ll try to make this short. I’m very unsure about my future: i’m at the last year of high school, and i’m feeling stuck cause in 18 years i’ve never been able to make friends. 

Plus, i’ve got a very big problem: i’ve never been in a relationship. It wouldn’t be a big problem but it crushes my self esteem and knowing that my first time hasn’t come yet ( and might never come ) really makes me anxious. 

I see couples everywhere and i often ask myself “how did they get to know each other? Why does it always happen to others, and not to me?”

And i’m kind of starting to find out why. It’s probably related to my looks too ( pics on my profile ). I’m balding pretty badly, but my parents keep denying. I don’t have great looks, and surely being bald at 18 won’t help with girls. Let’s not lie… looks matter in attraction. If i knew a certain girl was attracted to me, and if i liked her back, then it’d be easier. I’m very very shy and i often stutter. Plus, my physique is not a great one… not bad either ofc.

I’m just in a dark period of my life. I see guys changing girlfriend every week, and i’m still here.

We’re at a bit of a distance right now (8 hours) and from the start I’ve been saying we shouldn’t put pressure on each other in case it doesn’t work out in person etc. We have mutually expressed feelings and attraction for each other (came up quickly and intensely) but we’re waiting to establish anything committed or serious until we’ve met in person (a mutual decision...neither of us is open to an LDR without an end date). We’ve never met but even though we’ve had video calls (hours at a time) and were initially texting religiously all day every day that obviously couldn’t keep up and communication has significantly lessened. Not a problem for me – I hate being on my phone and texting isn't a big deal to me.

I was supposed to buy a ticket this week to fly out and meet him in September (have been discussing this plan for months now, repeatedly, mutually discussed and he was telling me over and over he wanted to meet me/wanted me there/asking how things were looking price wise and restriction wise and urging me to send him updates) but I held off on purchasing because I asked how he was doing this past week/if anything was on his mind. We had hardly spoken/messaged (which was a drastic shift from the week prior) and he wound up telling me he’s feeling overwhelmed with his life right now and doesn’t want us to hype anything up or put pressure on anything, acting like it was something I’d never said before. I reiterated what we’d already agreed on after he expressed concern at “long distance”. And then I gave him space because it seemed like his stress from other areas of life was bleeding into his feelings towards our interactions.

I stopped messaging him if I hadn’t heard from him, only texted him if he messaged me first. This was not to be petty – he said the upcoming week was going to be ridiculously busy and said he would try to call next week because he needed to talk to me about something (didn’t specify what but made it seem like a big deal). All of a sudden a week later from that ominous message this weekend he’s been messaging me a bunch of random, silly stuff? And when I don’t respond, he’ll tack on something else unrelated. Not asking questions or trying to have convos, just drunk texts or photos of him drinking and visiting with his friends. It’s not entirely out of the ordinary (he would drunk message me before/send pics of his days) but I just have no idea what’s going on. The tone shifts have been awkward and confusing, and it just seems like I’m waiting around until next week when he finds the time to clue me in on what’s happening.

I don’t know what to say to half of the random texts he sends me and so my responses have been minimal. He’s not asked after me in over two weeks. When I ever did volunteer what I was up to he’d almost immediately move onto another subject. Not initially but as time’s gone on that’s how it’s been. I’m annoyed already and we’re not even anything. It’s getting to the point that I don’t even know if I want to fly out because it feels like I'm just someone he's trying to get attention from than someone he's interested in getting to know anymore. I’m just not sure what to do because there’s been no communication going on and his difficulty managing all the stress in his life made me feel like I couldn’t bring up anything remotely serious until next week if he deigns to make space for that conversation he mentioned.

I didn't know he was that young when I first took notice of him. I'm certain that the crush is mutual, however I'm not sure what to do about it, or if I should even act on it at all because of the age difference. We don't work in the same department or anything so there's no major work related power dynamic that comes into play, but I'm definitely currently more established than he is (not looking for marriage or anything like that so I'm not too worried that would be an issue, at least not on my part).

The main problem is that I look younger than I am so I don't think he's realized what my actual age is and I only know his because some guys at work want to throw a surprise for his 20th birthday next month. I don't know him well enough to know just how different we are in maturity and he seems pretty mature outwardly for his age, but at his age I wouldn't be surprised if the difference was major. I'm not sure if I should acknowledge his feelings and give it all a go to find out.

And to make things worse, there's a 20yr old woman at work that likes him and seems pretty jealous whenever she sees me with him. He's flirted with her before in front of me but it's always been friendly and I've never felt jealous or insecure about it because 1) we're not together and 2) I have a flirty personality as well so I don't see any deeper meaning behind it. But there's been instances where we would be talking and she'd place herself right in the middle of us like a jealous gf. She also follows him around a lot and is always glaring at me when he brushes her off to talk/hang out with me. She essentially tries to give the impression that they're dating/in a relationship through her actions towards him, which he's apparently admitted to the other guys in the office makes him uncomfortable. I only know this because they've talked about it in front of me and I have a feeling the guys keep mentioning stuff like this specifically when I'm around because they know about his crush (I've seen them whispering and nudging him when I walk by and stuff like that).

He's a really nice guy but idk if the age difference + the drama of a potential one-sided cat fight with a girl is worth it. I've previously only ever dated guys my age or older so I don't even know what to expect when dating someone that much younger.

TLDR: Matched with a very interesting woman, left our first conversation halfway, i deemed she's not interested, i try to engage again smoothly to which she responded, then went offline again, and responded to my instagram stories, and left the conversation again without opening my DMs. I'm not sure if she's busy, disinterested or playing games. 


I'll try to summarise this as much as i can

So i matched with this girl who i found really interesting. So far the most interesting match I've gotten. Getting a match itself is rare in it of itself so this one seems like a catch.

I started the conversation, asking her about her dream job in her bio, to which she replied. I then went over to her linked Instagram account and introduced myself as her match. Conversation went pretty good. 

Red flags (?):

She smokes

Her page is focused on her. An entire highlight of just her pictures with filters. She obviously knows she's pretty

Prefers hanging around guys because girls are drama

When i talked about other girls in a particular workforce that I'm in, she went ""wow they must be really pretty right?"", Which is something i believe only girls who are jealous of their boyfriends do after a few months into the relationship. Is she just trying to find some validation from me? Is she expecting me to say that she's pretty? Or is it a genuine question?


I'm not sure if these are red flags but they're interesting pointers to be made.

So i decided to still go ahead with the conversation because she seemed quite cool, and engaging in the conversation, which some girls aren't. 

Suddenly halfway through the conversation, from instant replies to my texts, she went offline. I took it as her being busy, which is fine. She didn't leave my text on read, so which really most likely means she's genuinely busy. 

Fast forward to the next day's afternoon, i thought to myself ""can't be she's not awake yet and can't even reply to yesterday's text"". 

I decided to ""poke"" her with a ""my flirting was so good i made her speechless"", which is way way way better in my opinion than a ""hey good afternoon, why aren't you replying?"", Which seems really desperate. 

So few hours later, she sent a laughing emoji and said good afternoon. I asked her, ""were u on night shift last night?"", as a joke as she's still a student, but she said she has a dream job as a night shifter, To which she went offline again, for the entire day. 


I went on with my day, went for a haircut and had a crazy day where i fell in the saloon in front of all the customers. I posted this in my Instagram stories which she still follows. She then replied ""I'm so engrossed in your stories 😂"", to which i ask ""which part is the best part?"", To which she went offline again. At least she didn't leave me on seen which i think is possibly worse as it shows disinterest and that she's ignoring me. 

I'm really confused whether she's interested or not, as she seems to still be engaging in my Instagram stories, even having voted on my poll regarding a haircut i should get. But she keeps going offline often and not responding to my texts, but sent me a text regarding my Instagram story, and still follows me. She also said that none of her okc matches talk to her and in the end called her a catfish. 

This morning, which is my third day of text with her, i asked her out to which she didn't open the DM again. My first text which was a ""ikr"", to a reply to her text regarding my story, she left on seen. The following texts regarding asking her out, she didn't read but went offline. 

I'm not desperate nor insecure, there's many possibilities that are in my head such as her maybe having other matches, being busy, being disinterested, or even possibly playing games with me. I'm just really confused as she complained about matches ignoring her, but is doing the same thing to me. At this point, I've accepted the fact that I'm just one of her followings (I don't follow her anymore to make sure I don't get distracted thinking about this whole thing, and checking her account again and again to see if she's online). 

I watched a video on woman psychology and an interesting point that could be a possibility of what she's doing is something women do which is to ""test"" the man to expose his insecurities or desperation, usually by pulling away and not being engaging.

I'm 31(m), never dated, never had a relationship and never had sex in my life, and now I'm just a big 'ole walking red flag because of it. I feel ugly all the time, I'm short and bald and I don't do beards or facial hair at all, I shave clean daily because it feels much better to me. I don't have much money, I work a retail job and I never got the chance to go to college so I missed out on the college experience and I obviously never went to grad school, so now I'm uneducated and stupid for my age and feel looked down on because of it. I die on the inside when I see couples at work daily, it makes me sad and jealous and bitter that they get to shop and spend time together and have fun while I'm stuck at work on the weekends as per usual.  


I even tried to hang out with coworkers to try and get out more, but I didn't feel any happier or better being with them. I still felt lonely and I felt like a creep because they were younger than me to boot, not to mention that I started crushing on one of them, but knew it wouldn't happen and it shouldn't because she's too young for me(She just turned 21, I'm 31), so now I can't even hang out with her because it hurts too much  


As a guy, I resent being told the same old, that I have to be outgoing, confident, have a brilliant personality and have 8 billion friends and hobbies. The pressure and burden to initiate and approach is completely all on me and I'm also expected to shrug off the dozens, hundreds, possibly even thousands of rejections like they're nothing, I'm not allowed to be vulnerable, to show fear, vulnerability, I'm not allowed to be human and cry over things or feel anything about everything.  


I've recently come to the realization that I'm a submissive man, I'd much rather my partner take charge, be the confident and assertive one in the relationship while I'd fall into a more supporting role where I help and support her in anyway I can. The expectations thrust onto me are ironically the traits and qualities that I find appealing in women for a potential partner(assertive, dominant, confident but still loving, sweet and empathetic and patient), I no longer want to be seen as a macho dude or assumed that I automatically have no feelings or emotions just because I'm a man. I recently made a thread detailing these feelings in this sub and I was constantly insulted and mocked by both men and women, called a wimp, a loser, a sissy, the male equivalent of their girlfriend PMS'ing, it was extremely upsetting and hurtful to me but I have no where else to unload this emotional baggage, so here I am again.  


I've never known what it's liked to be touched, to be desired, to be wanted, the feelings of sexual and romantic intimacy and it's left me feeling deeply shamed, lonely and disgusted with myself. I'm so tired of people acting like being single is this fun and liberating thing, I'm sure it is after dating someone and knowing that you'll just end up in another whenever you want, that's how it is for many but for me it's been a deeply lonely experience. I'm tired of being told that sex and relationships aren't that big a deal when clearly they are or else people wouldn't want sex or be in relationships in the first place, people frequently proclaim that they couldn't have made it without their partner being there and supporting them, why do they get to have that but not me?  


I've been treated like shit my whole life by most people, I was poked fun at, teased, laughed at or shamed for crying or showing emotions that weren't considered manly, I've been depressed since I was 15, in my early 20s I was traumatized by a group of people I thought were friends but they also made fun of me, poked fun at me, talked about me behind my back etc.  


Everyone else dates, everyone else has relationships, everyone else has sex and love and intimacy, meanwhile I still get shamed daily, told that I need to fix all my problems, move on and just 'deal' with things like they were no problem at all. As a man I can't ever just get validation and support, instead I have people acting like my emotions and feelings are just fun little puzzles to solve for their amusement.   


I get told that I'm not entitled to love or sex....by people that attain the very same things. I get told to learn to be happy on my own and fix all my problems before dating and seek therapy. Alright, so let's first assume that I can even afford therapy, because as we all know, mental health in the US has been famously well funded, extremely affordable and very accessible. But even if I do start seeing a therapist, it's literally 40 mins every week, what am I suppose to do in the mean time? Stare at a wall? Twiddle my thumbs until my therapist has proclaimed that I'm healthy and cured enough to go out and seek relationships? I wasted over a decade of my life being alone and lonely and now I get told to continue living alone and being lonely until I'm happy and stable. Why do I have to tackle all of this alone and by myself while everyone else has SO's and a support network, it feels extremely unfair. I know life is unfair and in a capitalist system like the one we live, unfairness is systemic and by design to boot, but It feels like I got the short end of the shitty stick.  


I have no hope for my future, I have no self-esteem right now, I have no reason to feel valued or valid, I feel weak and pathetic and I know that I'll likely get razed on by trolls or given patronizing and condescending and unsolicited advice. I'll get told to get over my pain, quit feeling entitled and just stop being all of this, I know it's coming

During our coffee, I gave her several pointers on improving her resume, however once I received it, it still had a few missing things. I kindly asked her if it was okay if I modified her resume (fixed some errors in grammar etc, put in some key phrases) and she accepted them thanking me. Anyways I sent this off to my manager about a week ago... But I dont think it'll eventuate to anything because we're pretty full in terms of workers there. 

I like this girl, she's sweet and appears kind, but I'm afraid she might have just wanted to catch up professionally. Now I'm stumped on how I can properly ask her out, considering shes expecting to gain a 6 week internship at the company I work at... Is there anyway of properly asking her out? What would you guys recommend? I was thinking of giving her a call and just asking her if she wanted to catch up again for coffee?

So…to the point, I’ve dated about +or- 15 women since the divorce. Out of those, I have noticed one thing (Keep in mind, I’ve ended it with all of them so this isn’t a sob story) excluding four of them. If I am genuinely myself, no not a pushover, just truly myself, it goes well and I get laid and all that bullshit. But here’s the kicker (a majority of them), when I sort of set them aside they lose their minds. Text me constantly, want attention and generally throw their clothes off. I hate this. I want to just be myself and love on them, tell them how I feel and most importantly, love how I know how to love someone . So I guess what I’m saying is..well idk actually.

I’m a woman in my mid 20s who is trying to dip her toes in the world of dating (after some…tough experiences/anxieties in my earlier 20s) and yeah…it’s really tough. While I don’t have a hard time getting matches, they’re not panning out. Like at all.

Here are the experiences that I’ve had that ultimately made me decide to unmatch…

* Matching with someone on Bumble and sending that first message, but then getting one word responses (seriously…why guys do this???). One of the conversations was literally like this:

&gt; Me: Hey how’s your weekend been?

&gt; Him: Good

&gt; Me: That’s great to hear! I see you went to Spain last year, what was your favorite city?

&gt; Him: Madrid

&gt; Me: *unmatched the dude*

* Guys suggesting we meet up, then making vague date plans and flaking when trying to establish the logistical details of the date

* Guys stopping any sort of response after the first couple of messages or so

* Guys pressuring me to come over to their apartment like right then and there and ghosting when I suggest an alternate time/a public location 

Variations of this scenario has happened so many times that I’m honestly disheartened. I feel like while I don’t have a hard time getting matches and a few superficial messages with some of these matches, I can tell I’m not really “number 1” for any of these guys. I just get the vibe that they like me enough to not “let me go”, but that they’re holding out for something better (probably someone more conventional looking and blonde maybe?).

Anyways, any tips to not lose heart? It’s really been affecting my self esteem, especially because according to Reddit as long as you’re fit and young and reasonably attractive you should be drowning in “prospects”. But that’s def not the case. I also see Reddit dudes often say things like, “Maybe you’re not good looking enough for these guys.” But that makes me wonder…what can I do except literally get plastic surgery at this point and make myself look like those Instagram girls (while I’m pretty I def don’t look like an influencer)?

I’ve always known that I’ve struggled to be myself and to let people really know me. I suspect I’m insecure avoidant – I find I’m constantly not wanting to “burden” others with my feelings and problems, being vulnerable is hard and I’ve generally built a façade of pseudo-independence.

It gets really draining, feeling like I cannot be vulnerable or open up (even though I want to). I’ve noticed that with all the people I’ve felt an emotional connection to and therefore become attracted to (I also think I'm demisexual... so many labels haha), they all had something about them that made me feel like I could “drop the performance” and that I’d be safe to be myself around them. It’s a rarity that I find people I feel I can be myself around. These people tend to have traits of being laidback, non-judgmental and sensitive. They also tend to be slightly odd or endearingly awkward in some ways, similar to me. And then it’s like a chicken and egg situation – the more I start liking them, the more I want to be open and myself around them, because they deserve to see that side of me. And then the more I can be open and myself around them, the more I start liking them. With some other people, I think to myself “they don’t deserve to know me like that” and “I’m not safe to open up to them because they’ve shown they are judgmental” and so I’m forced to perform when I’m around them and maintain a certain façade which gets draining, and this in turn makes me dislike and resent them, and the dislike and resentment of them makes me want to remain closed off.

I started to chat with a girl on Bumble and quickly it was intense and cool with her. We send each other a lot of messages and everything seem truly great with her.  We talk for 1 week before plan a date and it was yesterday evening.  


So we took a drink in a nice bar at 18h30, because she has another party after that. The date was perfect, she seems happy, laughing, sharing a lot of things. During the drink, she saw my over-shirt and start wearing it for the joke and ask me if she could keep it for tonight, she told me that she will bring  back the shirt at our next date, so I said ""Yes"", I would be happy to see her again.   
So it's 22h30 and she leaves me to catch up her friends with my jacket. She sends me a message 10mn after to say to me that was an excellent date and she will be happy to see me again with an emoji red heart !!!!! So imagine, I was already imagine so much things with her.  


BUT NOW,  the saddest part... At 3AM she sends me a image, first I didn't identify what was the object, and it was a hair pin that she founds in my over-shirt pocket and it was definitely not mine and I had no idea why it was here, I didn't wear this jacket for years.  
So I message back :  
""Oh that's akward ! I have no idea why it's here. It piss me off because you will think I'm not a serious guy now""  


Since that message, I have no news and I don't know how to repair this mistake and to have her trust again.

The reason for the high number is I am not emotionally attracted to those girls which talk about themselves all the time and it seems to be a constant theme. The most recent being a (26F).

I live in Berlin but I'm pretty sure it's like this in most places as I've seen posts about this often. It seems most woman out there just needs someone to asks them questions about themselves so they can begin talking about themselves and invest very little in return, forgetting that there is actually 2 people in a relationship. Now I only say most woman because I've only dated woman and most of which are like this. 

Regardless of gender, it seems as though there is a burning need to talk about oneself without any provocation of doing so, meaning even if I don't ask her any questions she would still constantly talk about herself. On the odd occasion where she does ask me a question, she interrupts my answer to answer her own question about herself. I've heard that this might be a way of getting the guy to like them but I assure you that it is not. It is actually quite the opposite and a massive turn off. 

Now I would rather someone be real with me and not be fake and pretend like they care about me when they don't, I mean someone's true colours will show in due time so I don't see the point. But it wouldn't kill to ask a question or two about the other person, it doesn't even need to be good question, just something like ""how's your day?"" Or ""what have you been up to?"" to show that they care. God forbid the girl gives a compliment. Maybe I'm too old fashioned and expect some affection from my partner.

I actually brought this up with the girl I was recently seeing and she said that she just expected me to share this information. But first of all I'm not that kind of person and I think alot of guys aren't good at sharing emotions or talking about themselves (granted, some definitely are). Second of all it feels like I would be treating the relationship as my personal therapy sessions. I agree that a healthy relationship is one where both parties share intimate things about themselves... Eventually. However I've always thought that it would be through actually caring and asking questions rather than forced rambling about their lives and experiences.

I understand a lot of people don't work on themselves and that may be a reason they get rejected. But whenever someone posts anything online about rejection or literally anything wrong in their dating life they get the advice to improve themselves even though nobody actually knows the person who posted and if they actually need to improve something. If you are someone who is actually working on themselves and you have been doing it for years you don't want to hear that because it's like basically saying ""you are never good enough"".

Firstly, everything is subjective when it comes to dating, including improvement. If you change your hairstyle you could see it as improvement and lots of people may love it, but for a lot of people that will be a turn off. The same thing applies to every other thing about yourself. So, you can never be liked be everyone. And the people you are into may like different things, so there is no point to change yourself, because you can't match everyone's type anyway.

Secondly, you should never change yourself to be liked by anyone other than yourself. If each time you get rejected you believe it was because you weren't good enough and you must ""improve"" you are basically using someone's approval to value yourself. You shouldn't do that. You have to understand that what you consider to be the ideal version of yourself will not match what other people may think that version is. 

And if you continuously get rejected even if you are actively working on yourself can mean that you didn't make enough progress, but it can also be that you are attracted to people that are into different things. Maybe you are blonde and the guy you like prefers brunettes. Does that mean you should change your hair color? Maybe you are adventurous and the girl you are interested in likes guys who are not like that. That doesn't mean you should stop doing what you like or that it's an improvement to stop doing your hobbies? No.
