She adored me, wanted my attention, reciprocated the energy I gave her and made me feel so happy. We talked and talked, caught feelings for each other, then told each other we loved one another. She told me about her BPD in a FaceTime but I didn’t mind it because she told she had it under control and was visiting a therapist to help cope with her emotions. I was so in love that I pressed on and didn’t mind it

Then we reached the lows of her emotions. She eventually revealed to me that we should stop telling each other that we love one another. Thay we were moving too fast and that she still needed to recover from the trauma of her ex, that she still wants to date but that eventually she’ll jump into a relationship with me.  

Then I went on my first vacation with my friends. A trip that I have been waiting for the longest. I would send her pictures, and videos of my trip, expecting her to be happy for me and ask about my day. Instead she’d be really dry and would complain that she was feeling depressed. So the conversations would always turn into me comforting her, trying help her get through the lows of her emotions.

   Then what eventually made me decide it was over, was the day I went to my first waterfall. I was high on adrenaline, the happiest I ever been. I sent her all the pictures and videos I took.  She took hours to respond, told me she had taken a nap, then started to feel sad because she doesn’t want to work all the time and wants to do something meaningful. Everything I did that day was pushed into the background and it was just me comforting her again   

So the next day I went for a walk, thought about things, and sent her the message of wanting to end things. I now feel terrible because I told this girl that I was going to be around forever.

I empathize that women need to sort through a lot of dangerous men to find someone good. I can't understand it from experience but I try to empathize with their struggle nonetheless. But I feel like I'm not offered the same empathy, at least when I bring up my struggles with my friends. 

I don't think it's controversial to say that women have an easier time getting dates and sex. They struggle with a lot of other, different things when it comes to dating, of course. But for just getting the opportunity to date or fuck, it's easy. For men, it's the opposite. You work hard on your profiles, improve your flirting, work on yourself, build your skills, and put yourself out there. But it's to no avail. Frankly, it's really freakin' frustrating! There's always going to be something new to work on, but it sucks to see no results from your previous improvements! 

But I don't feel like women even try to empathize with that, while I at least put in the effort to empathize with their situation. I talk to friends of all genders about dating sometimes, and my women friends are always very quick to point out their struggles instead of even trying to understand my point of view. It's not like it's a constant thing, either. I'd understand if I was constantly bringing it up and whining about my ""lack of options"" or whatever. But  I don't do that. I discuss dating with them very rarely, and when I do I consider it a pretty dang vulnerable thing. So when they almost immediately try to invalidate my experience, it hurts.

While we were having a conversation, he made a comment about my friend. He asked if she was cute. I didn’t know how to react so I said “all my friends are cute”. I felt completely disrespected so I told him.

He didn’t respond until later on yesterday evening. He gave me a really condescending apology and said it was a bad joke. I tried to end the conversation before I said something I didn’t mean. 

I can understand this is confusing but I wasn’t in a position to explain. It felt disgusting when he mentioned another woman to me, friend or not. It’s really disrespectful. 

He kept trying to continue the conversation, I know I should have ignored him until I slept on it and calmed down but I couldn’t. I said:“Ur weird
Let’s put a pin in this”

He accepted it and said it was fun talking. I wasn’t proud of myself but I knew it was best for us both to move on.

She has many mental health issues and has a lot of trauma in the past and has very bad commitment issues but I don’t know whether to give up on her after everything and throw it all away but she doesn’t seem to be in the mindset of working on herself or working towards us and really doesn’t think what she has done is that bad. She never knows what she wants and always says this but in the past year has had her guard up with me and doesn’t let anything physical to happen between us 

We’ve been on and off for over two years. We met working together and started going out we were very good at first and things went well. At first I was very needy and she was bad at showing how she really felt and She has many issues that at first she wasn’t open about that much but overtime has said it all. She has struggled with severe depression, she’s diagnosed bipolar, and has a lot of trauma in her past and commitment issues that I wasn’t aware of or knew how to deal with at first. Overtime I changed and wasn’t needy and I learned how to deal with her when she’s going through certain things and help at whatever I can. The biggest fights we have and whenever we end is always because she won’t commit and I always push it too early before she’s ready because I never know and she’s really bad with this stuff. I want to be something more she doesn’t Id leave then a few weeks later she’d text. She has said she wants to be together, wants to date, and many times just wants to be friends when this happens but we don’t act act like friends we both do more than friends and have feelings for eachother. We are together almost everyday and do everything together. We’re with eachothers families all the time. go to holidays together, go out, go on vacation together. We know everything about eachother and have told eachother things that we’ve never told other people. In probably the last year or around that we have not hooked up anytime somethings about to happen she shuts it down and if I bring it up she go into the friends thing when so I stopped making a move but would say stuff. I have been told and seen evidence that she had talked to other people and sent nudes when we’ve been on. I’ve called her out over this but she has always denied it and tried acting like that stuff isn’t a big deal and that she hasn’t in a while and she has before and people have hers. This always pissed me off but all I can ever do is take her word for it and I believe she does this because of her low self esteem and need for approval because most of the time it is random people or people she doesn’t see. She hooked up with someone last year and I found out and flipped out we got in a huge fight and didn’t talk for a month until she reached out apologizing and kept saying she wanted to be together and felt bad about everything. I took her back and we were good and everytime we do get back together it’s better than the last time. I was away over a month ago and before this we were the best we had been ever. I pushed things way too far saying I loved her which I knew she wasn’t ready for. We both were mad at the other and a major fight broke up one of our biggest and we weren’t there yet she said she wasn’t ready for that. When I got home at first she was not that talkative but after a day she quickly was we picked up where we last were left off and thing she were good until last week when one of her friends said she met up with a guy off tinder and slept with him when I was away and when the huge fight had just happened. I called her out and she kept denying it until she finally said it happened and it meant nothing that it was just an impulsive decision and she was super high it meant nothing and she felt nothing. I was pissed but remained calm I was very upset and said that she hasn’t apologized and just kept saying it meant nothing and she thought we were done for good at the time because I said that and she wasn’t ready so it was over. I told her that I wasn’t going to let this go or forget it unless she lets her guard down and we start doing that stuff.

I matched with a girl on tinder and she quickly added me on Instagram. So far so good. But her profile was fairly recent, 2 months old, she didn't have that many photos and no highlights. I tried to search her name on the web and I found nothing, even reverse searched her photos but again nothing.

I was suspicious, and even more because she was just so beautiful that I couldn't believe. We talked a little over messages and she asked me if we could have some dinner at my place the next day, because she lives with her parents and on the next week she would go back to her state really far away. 

I tried not to sound rude, so I just said: ""of course I would like to meet you, I just want to be sure that you are the person that you claim to be and that this is your profile. Nothing personal, I just don't know you yet and just want to be safe. Can we video chat or maybe you take a picture doing something spontaneous, like showing your tongue or holding your ear""

Well, she did show her tongue.. licking her breasts, but I couldn't see her face, so I told her that I still couldn't be sure (for obvious reasons). She got kind of annoyed and a little mad and stopped responding.

The next day, way after we should meet she sent me a text saying: ""I don't know why you didn't want to meet me.. but here is your damn picture"", and then it was a picture clearly seeing her face and all, holding her ear, etc...

So long story short, I’m 30 yrs old and I’m having bad luck in the dating world. I come from a conservative household and “dating” is somewhat shun down upon so I’m a little socially awkward. That said, I’ve always been what I considered a people person.

I showed interest in this young lady who’s a few years older than me. We first met at her place of work when I was ordering business cards.  A week and a half before Valentine’s Day I sent her a card, sweetheart’s and balloons to her job. She really seem to appreciate it and we ended going out on a date to see a movie. Afterwards we went to a bar and had a drink. At the time the date seemed to go well to me and I thought she had genuine interest in me. 

Looking back however, there were some red flags. She revealed to me that she was in a previous 10 year relationship with a guy and it didn’t end well. And she loves, LOVES her cats more than anything. Anyway after the date I asked her out again a few days later and she was resistant, not answering my first text message, then responding to my next message saying she’s a homebody. I took her resistance in stride and gave her breathing space because I thought I might have come on too strong and jumpy. Maybe a month later I hit her up again on Instagram, just to see how she was doing. She said that she “has a boo kinda.” Again, I took it in stride and wished that it goes well for her, but I must admit I felt hurt and duped. 

These incidences keep happening to me all the time recently. Is it something that I’m doing wrong? I’m a pretty good looking guy (I say that with as much humility as possible) with a good heart but I get the feeling sometimes women don’t trust me. What can I do to improve and find a match?

I (21M) became friends with this girl (19F) for around a month. Met her through a mutual friend. We hung out a ton. Went out to get boba, food, and she came over a couple times to hang out, play video games, and workout. I asked her if she wanted to go on a date, but she rejected the idea and just wanted to stay friends. She suggested we can still hang out, so we still hung out just as friends.

A week passed, and we were hanging out almost daily. So I asked again if she wanted to be more than friends. She stopped me before I finished asking her if she wanted to more than friends, and she said she had the same feelings. So we started dating.

So we've been dating for about a week. She says she's excited for the things we could do together (road trip, gaming, dates), but all of a sudden, she calls me and says she gets anxious when she thinks about a relationship and also says she gets anxious when she texts me. Now she wants to step back and take a break from everything (relationships and general socializing). I said I was ok with taking a break and would still support her, but she seems adamant about ending any possibility of dating for the near future (1-2 years). It seems like she did a complete 180 with no warning.

I know that this probably isn't my fault, but I can't help but think about what I can do to save this situation. Makes me sad to think that someone who sounded so excited to be dating, all of a sudden gets anxious and wants to step back from socializing and relationships. I want to support her through this ""phase"", but again, she seems adamant about being independent through these times.

So basically I go to a target business school with lots of pretty girls. I usually don't like to flirt or try and date them because I find it weird because they're basically like co-workers. The main reason is because I want them and other people to perceive me as professional, and I dont think dating in my program would really help that case (we network, and I don't want them to remember me as that guy who banged the whole program). We have lots of cases, and classes together so it just things a little awkward. However, dating girls outside of my faculty is no problem to me and I will go on many dates with other girls.

We chat for around two weeks every day in anticipation of a meeting. Chemistry is good and we’re interested in each other. She has to cancel on me the night before our first date which was a bummer, but we reschedule for the next week

I head over to her apartment and drive her to where we were gonna get lunch. We pretty much have an instant connection, and we’re laughing together the whole time

We had an amazing discussion over lunch, and got dessert afterwards. I felt like I could be myself with her, and then we went to get tea and go for a walk. We just sat and talked for over an hour. She would smile and laugh or grab my arm whenever I flirted with her. 

The whole time we were laughing, making inside jokes and discussing our lives and cultures. Our date lasted from about 11-5.

I dropped her off at her place since she already had plans with one of her girlfriends later that night. She had said that she wasn’t sure if she was looking for friends or not on tinder, and I told her we could talk about that stuff later. I just wanted to have fun. 

I drove home happy and elated at the potential. After leaving an abusive relationship last year and going on countless shitty or underwhelming first dates it felt like I’d maybe found my person

We text that we’d both had a great time after. The next day I called her to try and set up plans but she was busy. I decided to do the normal advice and wait two days to contact again.

Tried to call her, no response, Text her some detailed plans for a second date where we’d go to a place she had wanted to see. Over a day later , and still no response. 

We had been talking and texting pretty much all day every day before the date, so so I know she’s most likely just ghosting me.

I can only chalk it up to I may have flirted with her a little too much, which I doubt, or she might just have seen me as a friend and I made it clear I wanted to date.

I hate that women are truly *disgusted* in a visceral way by black men, women are usually content to see black men as things like thugs or a non-sexual object like a lamp, but if a black man hit on a woman she would want to throw up and feel depressed that the man thought he had a chance

In my entire 23 years of life I have almost never seen a black man with even a semi-attractive women, black guys usually take whatever we can get because we know women **do not want us** at all and will only date us due to desperation or mental illness; idgaf about celebrities and athletes 

Most women who sleep with black men see it as bestiality if they are not black themselves, and if the woman *is* black she won't think that way certainly but if the guy is short sorry bucko he's just jerking himself off and will die alone 

Asian men whine and complain constantly but I cannot comprehend it, China will likely rule the world by 2100 so Asian men will get all the attention anyway and the average asian man imo does better with women than the average black man, black men just have absolutely *no standards at all* so manage to get laid more

Preferences don't exist when the only racial preference women have is European **white** men and the preference is mostly a requirement

What seemed to hurt the most was the fact that he moved on pretty quick got back together with his ex 3 days after we broke up and he now claims that she was the love of his life.
 Some background over here would be that I started dating him a full year after he broke up with his ex. I was the one who caught feeling and confessed then we started dating about 3 - 4 months after that. He claims that she is the love of his life while I think he is the loml but I can't just do anything about it.
I'm happy that he is happy but really hurt inside, how do I go about it is remaining friends a great idea also her always keeps talking about her he is really happy with her, but it low-key makes me sad.
Should we continue being friends, I don't want to loose him from my life but also can't be broken anymore.

I can't get over what my ex-girlfriend did to me. I guess I'm somewhat average looking, but post-breakup a year and a half ago, I still don't have lasting confidence or success with women post-breakup.

My girlfriend and I dated a year and a half. It was my first relationship. We ended up breaking up and two weeks later getting back together 13 months in. She was very controlling and kept taking my phone to read my texts and snaps to ensure I wasn't cheating on her. She did this when I went to sleep, shower, leave the room, etc. As a note, she had been cheated on by two exes, and I know that affected her personality. After hundreds of times of phone stealing, and getting back together and her still doing it, I decided to check her phone to see if she had anything to hide (yes this was my one invasion of her privacy to her hundreds of mine, I know). I ended up finding dozens of contacts in her phone she had been corresponding with on Snapchat and text. The snap messages were asking for explicit pictures, and her responses were very flirty. The text messages were very suggestive and flirty and there were deleted messages and gaps in time I noticed. These messages were not just at times where we might have fought a bit, but at the times I thought she was the most happy, where she was outwardly the happiest, and when she told me she wanted to marry me. I was crushed. I immediately took pictures of the evidence and then confronted her on them in an ignorant fashion. She lied about any text/snap conversations. I showed her evidence. She continued to deny and deny. I showed her more. She only admitted to talking to people after we got back together, because she claimed she thought I wasn't going to stay with her. It was a huge argument and I wanted to break up with her that week permanently. My mother, feeling I would die alone and she was my best bet at marriage, told me it wasn't that bad and to stay with her. But I never emotionally could commit to her again and the relationship died five months later.

Twice a week I am taken back to reading the texts. I just can't believe someone who was so infatuated with me could claim she loved me and wanted nothing more than to marry me would say those things then talk on the side. I don't even know if she actually did anything physical in meeting up with them or not. She also took my phone again shortly afterwards and deleted all of my screenshots of the conversations, and I didn't realize until later. I know a lot of people here have had worse than me and literally caught their SO in bed with someone else, but I just really want to move past this, so I can attract and be able to emotionally commit to a beautiful human being in the future.

 To lay it all out and give some background:
I'm 37 and in a live-in coparenting relationship with the father of my 2 young children. Almost 2 years ago we were in couple's therapy and we agreed to see other people and remain living together, rather than breaking up. This arrangement is mostly due to finances.  At this point though,  I'd describe our relationship as an ""open relationship."" We have sex with each other a few times a month.  We still have sexual chemistry but that's about it. There's alot of emotional, mental, and even physical aspects of our relationship that are severely lacking and that's why I was the one to suggest seeing other people (which he agreed to). 

I'm not on any dating sites and I havent actively looked for anyone. I'm open to exploring whatever comes along. 

What came along,  oddly enough for me,  was a stoner dude nearly half my age. I've dated men twice my age since I was 18, so being attracted to someone younger is odd for me.  He is my coworker and we've become pretty close friends.  I find myself smiling and laughing all the time with him, looking forward to seeing him at work, and lastly,  fantasizing about screwing his brains out. 

I just really don't know if the feeling is mutual.  He had a few opportunities to make a move and he didn't.  There are a couple things that make me think he might like me...maybe??

A. He ""likes"" every single one of my Instagram posts and is usually the first to ""like.""

B. He smokes me up for free all the time after work. He never asks for anything in return.  

C. I see him looking at me across the room at work pretty much all the time.  

He doesn't know that my partner and I have this open arrangement, so I'm thinking maybe that's what's stopping him... I mean he's had plenty of opportunities to make a move but he hasn't so much as touched my hand/arm/shoulder. Nothing.   He doesn't really flirt either.  He's goofy and fun with me but not flirty. 

We're supposed to hang out at his place sometime in the next few weeks. I'm not sure if I should try to make a move or not. I just don't want to ruin our friendship if he's not interested in me in the same way. 

I can't stop thinking about being super hot and intimate with my little stoner dude.  What should I do?

For perspective. 

I match with plenty of people. 

I message first, no response. 

I respond to their message with any sort of exclamation point, or anything longer than one sentence with proper grammar and capitalization, no response. Basically any sort of attempt at genuine conversation is greeted by a stone wall and deafening silence. Even worse is when I'm hit with the ""I'm not looking for pen pals.""
