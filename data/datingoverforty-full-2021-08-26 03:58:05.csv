Elise started dating an American guy --Eric (late 40's)-- in the next-town-over, about a 90m journey through public transport, in Feb. 2020. Lately, she has been traveling to him for the weekend about twice a month, and he to her for the weekend about once a month, so they are together nearly every weekend. 

Our company has a generous transfer program, and a huge office in the next-town-over. Our window for applying is September to November, with moves from June to August. Elise has been thinking about it. Eric has been encouraging it. I'm sure they talked about moving in, but I don't know how confirmed that was.

First work day for new transfers, Monday, Elise is in the front and I'm in the back of a RideShare with a new colleague --Dianne-- who has transferred from the next-town-over's office. Dianne is talking about how she went down for a last weekend hurrah to see folks there who were leaving the country. A few of them went to Starbucks® to hang out, where they ran into a local language teacher who had taught/ assisted all of them. They also encountered an American guy who worked at a company in our industry.  
Dianne says,   
""Oh! LocalLanguage Teacher (LLT) sent me a picture -- she's started dating that American!""  
Hands her phone around -- it's a pic of LocalLanguage Teacher, in a pool, with her arms around Eric.  
\----------  
I wanted to end my post there, with the ""dramatic reveal,"" but there is a little more.

Elise says, ""Oh, I know him.""  
Dianne, ""How well? The LLT (20's) seems to really like him. Is he a good guy?""  
Elise: ""Well, I thought so ...""  
Dianne: ""She says that he said he hadn't been dating for about 18 months. How did you meet him?""  
Elise (in the front of the car, looks back at me,) ""Well, I've been seeing him for the last 18 months.""

Dianne is speechless.

Elise gets LLT's contact info and once we get to work, texts her using the app we all use in this country. They exchange about 4 texts.  
Elise: ""We've been seeing each other for over a year.""  
LLT: ""But you live in a different city!""  
LLT says she has to go to the gym but she'll get back to Elise.   
Elsie's text: ""I don't have time for cheaters and liars. I'm done with him and with you.""  
\-----  
*Bonus ending:*   
RideShare home from work today (Thursday). Elise's phone chirps. Eric is messaging Elise's phone number:   
""Hi Sweetheart! Why did you block me on the texting app? I miss you. I miss your kisses. When can I see you again?""  
Elise is furious -- HOW did her get her phone number?   
Dianne and I say at the same time, ""BLOCK HIM!""  
And, she does.  
\~fin\~  
*Since I should have a question for everyone-- what did Elise miss?*   
*As a good friend, how can I help her?*   
\-----------  
*Bonus opinion and random details:*  
I totally believe that LLT and Eric had been together for quite a while. They didn't randomly meet at a Starbucks® -- they randomly met people from our company and Eric warned LLT to ""play it cool.""

I (47F) am taking my time navigating the dating thing after a looooong marriage. I do get consistent interest, but have figured out by now that this new dating world is extremely different from when I started dating my ex-spouse 25 years ago. What might seem quite promising at the beginning can quickly dissolve for the most random reasons or none at all, so I’m taking it nice and slow and just enjoying the experience of meeting guys for coffee and convo or whatnot. It’s been nice to just chill and get to know someone.  I don’t want to rush to the sex part until it feels right and natural according to the pace and dynamic as things evolve. 

On the other hand I really miss sex. Like, a lot. So there’s a tension there. 

How do you ladies approach this phase? Prematurely sleeping with someone I’m getting to know with the general intention of cultivating a LTR can ruin the relationship potential from my perspective. So do you have casual encounters while doing the dating thing? Or while you’re getting to know someone, when you realize it isn’t a LTR fit, do you shift the dynamic to a physical short-term NSA thing instead of moving on?

Met someone on. OLD, had a few text chats and arranged to meet at a pub. It was an Irish pub and there was some football on the screen.

I got there first and I ordered a drink. He was a few minutes late. I settled in and started watching football. He came in and said a quick hello before going to the bar to order his drink. He came back and hardly said a few words before pulling out his phone and started texting/reading/playing on his phone. 

There was an hour between my date and my next appointment. I prefer to have something else to do after dates. It makes it easier for me to make excuses but also incase things don't go well as was the case this time. I ended up watching football for an hour and made my excuses to get out.

He followed me to my car and asked for a lift to his apartment. I was uncomfortable but I didn't say no. I drove him to his place and he invited me in. I politely refused and reminded him that I had things to do. He asked me what I was doing after my thing and I replied that I was going home. He didn't seem pleased and TOLD me, I should come back to his apartment after my thing.

Now I don't know how he thought this date went well. I still struggle to understand what I said or did that gave him the impression that I was going to sleep with him. The few sentences we exchanged included me pointing out that his profile pictures were a few years out of date. He had put on quite a bit of weight and had a few wrinkles and he had lost a bit of hair. None of these physical traits would matter to me if he was he was honest about them in the first place.

This is long.

I have a friend who’s a couples counselor, he told me, “the toughest job as a parent is the role of step-parent.” He wasn’t lying.

Flash backwards 9 years. I met my now ex, her kids were 3 and 4 when we met. I don’t have kids of my own and I instantly bonded with them. I dated their mom for a little over 7 years. For a few of those years, we all lived together. It was a whole new ballgame. No sleeping late, ever. But, you know what, it was okay, because they were, and are, awesome kids.

When we broke up they were 11 and 12. I’d been in their lives way more than I hadn’t. Their mom and I broke up about six months before Covid hit. I moved out. The plan all along was for the breakup to be amicable and me to stay in their lives. Even during Covid, the kids and I would FaceTime, or play games online, or do the Disney thing where you watch a movie at the same time. It was pretty cool, especially since I couldn’t see them in person.

For a time during Covid we discussed getting back together. Well, that fell apart, and probably for the best. We were definitely arguing more towards the end of the relationship.

Fourteen months into Covid, she texts me and says we needed to talk. She called and told me she was seeing someone, and since it was a mutual friend of ours, she wanted me to hear it from her first. Fine. I honestly just want her and the kids to be happy. I told her when we broke up, “I love you enough to let you go.” I meant it. 

So, a little after that phone call, I texted her because her son’s birthday was coming up and I asked her what he wanted for his birthday.

She said, “don’t get him a present.” Basically with that, I was cut out of their lives.

We never married. I had no recourse, no legal ground, nothing I could do if I wanted to see the kiddos and she didn’t want me to. It took a while for that to sink in, when it did, it hurt. A lot.

For that reason, I don’t think I could ever date a person with young kids again. Because I don’t want to go through that loss again.

Her kids could call me in 10 years and I’d still do anything for them if they needed my help.

Anyway, I hope there’s some people out there who can identify with my story. I just needed to vent.

Good luck out there.

tl;dr If you date someone with kids long term and breakup, be prepared to have your heart broken in a way that is way worse than breaking up with just your significant other.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,56349,public,self,"[53M] Being the step-parent, one man's story",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pcci1k/53m_being_the_stepparent_one_mans_story/,some_ads,7,,628375fa-4425-11e9-9805-0e7c3aad8200,Discussion,,,,,,,,,

Met this nice man (42) on a dating app, we chat for a few days and go on a first date. It goes really well, the ""quick drink after work"" turns into over three hours of conversation. We chat, we laugh, we discover a lot of common interests, it was fun. He walks me to my car and we end up standing there (in the drizzling rain!) chatting for another solid half hour. We part with a nice hug - ok I think, maybe my leaning towards him and my my touching his upper arm and forearm were too subtle.

He texts me the following day telling me he had a great time. I reply that I too had a great time and would like to see him again. He immediately asks me if I'm free on Thursday of the following week, his first night with no kids (he's got partial custody). We make plans and we end up texting about every other day, sometimes more, he initiates more than I do.

So date two comes around and we have to work around the weather and move to an indoor venue and grab drinks/food. Not my first choice as there is now a table between us. Anyways, the evening goes much like the first. Lots of laughter, lots of things to talk about, we are in there for four hours or so. He walks me to my car and again we end up standing there another half hour or so talking. He asks me ""are you free tomorrow?"" and proceeds to invite me to his regular board game night with his friends (I love board games, he knows that, is one of the things we have in common). I am free, so I agree. I initiated a hug upon meeting earlier in the evening, I'm expecting he will initiate at least another hug now. Nope, he wishes me goodnight and walks away. Wtf.

I'm really confused. It's starting to feel like he has no romantic interest and just sees me as a (potential) friend. But why invite me to an evening with his friends? Maybe it's just me, but I wouldn't introduce random guy I had a couple dates with to my friends.

I know no one here is a mind reader, but what do you think might be going on here? He's been divorced for two years, not sure how much dating he has done in that period. Maybe he's out of practice?

Looking back I'm pretty sure my ex was text book HPD. 

She was very seductive, always needed to be the center of attention, controlling, manipulative, didn't have relationships with women and all here close relationships were with men who she met online, very vague when talking about things in her life that required details, dramatic, and cared more about the opinions of others outside our relationship than my thoughts and feelings when we had our issues.  From what I learned,  her previous relationships ended either because of cheating or because she was bored and sex was used to ensnare me into her 

When I asserted my boundaries or put some physical distance between us, she acted very dramatically, and usually she used her charm and sex to win me back. She told me she loved me after our last break-up and got upset when I told her I could never love her and proceeded to tell me about the scores of men who wanted her on dating apps.  That was pretty much the last straw for me and I left. 

Now I'm a shell of myself and my therapist even mentioned that the guy sitting in front of her wasn't the same guy who walked into her office 3 months ago (before I met her). 

I'm anxious all the time and even had had suicide attempt when she broke up with me for a few days  I thought she was normal and that I was the crazy one
because I wouldn't put up with her BS and people that knew the 2 of us would always take her side. Medications have helped to some degree but I'm a fucking wreck.  

While I feel validated by one of my therapist friends that I wasn't the ""crazy"" one in the relationship. I lost friends in the process.  I'm am definitely no contact with her and and plan to take a break from dating until I feel I'm ready to get back out there, which make take months or years of therapy. 

Having been in 2 emotionally manipulative relations I feel.like I'm a magnet for these type.of women and it will take time to break the cycle.

Do I (39/F) pick him (43/M) up from the airport? Do I treat him for all our meals because he is paying for his flight and hotel? Do I treat it like a normal first date, or something more because we have been talking and video chatting for a few weeks? See more below…

Matched with someone on OLD who was passing through. I rarely write to such matches, but I really liked his profile and didn’t expect him to respond. But he did, and chatting was fun and easy. He suggested talking on the phone, which went well, then FaceTime, also great. I started to hesitate because a long-term, permanent relationship, which we both want, seemed impossible with the distance and our respective commitments. But then he suggested we meet once just to see, and he’d come to me (2.5-hour plane ride). We’ve already discussed that he’d move for the right relationship, but not for 2 years until his son goes to college, and I would possibly move but not for a couple years myself until I accomplished a few more things at work.

He’s coming in a week. He booked his flight and hotel for the weekend. I’m trying very hard to live in the moment and see it as a fun weekend that might be nothing else. We both agreed that if we don’t have a connection on the first evening he’s here, no hard feelings and he will explore the city on his own. 

Do I pick him up from the airport when he arrives?. If not, do I pick him up from his hotel or have him meet me somewhere for dinner? 

If we do spend more than the first evening together, should I offer to pay for our dates the rest of the weekend since he came to see me? I would naturally offer to split on the first date, and insist on doing so if I know I don’t like the person and don’t want see him again, but will allow someone to pay if he insists the first time and then treat on a subsequent dates. But what should I do here? Should I get him a gift? (We’ve talked about my veggie and flower garden, was thinking a bouquet for his hotel room from my garden and some cherry tomatoes for a snack, which me mentioned he loves). Is that too much since it is a first date? (An OLD date once got me flowers at the first date, and it turned me off, but we had only texted for a couple of days before meeting and I thought it was more a meet and greet than a date so it made me uncomfortable. But then another OLD date where we had texted for longer and talked on the phone had gotten me some chocolate on a first date, after we had discussed the kind of chocolate we both like, and I actually thought it was really nice and thoughtful. But we had talked quite a bit before we first met...) 

I do like this guy, but I’m not holding my breath. I would be very happy if we did have a good connection and we wanted to try to date, but fine if it didn’t work out. I don’t want to come off too strong and turn him off, but I also want to show that I appreciate him making the effort.

Backstory time!

When I was married, I was the sole breadwinner of the household for all but about three of the 17 years I was with my ex.  We had no children and were SINKS or DINKS (single/double income no kids) and had built an small retirement portfolio and a fancy house and didn't really want for anything, even though my ex went to school full time for 13 of those years.  We pulled it off because I'm pretty shrewd and at the time, I was really really into working.  60 hour weeks most weeks and 100 sometimes.  A month after my ex got employed after her last credential, she kicked me out and I had to face down her infidelity and our marriage was over.

We had a comfortable life.  But, to save a lot of detail, I don't want to really disclose, the divorce made it impossible for me to continue  that old life and I had to completely start over.  I mean, start over.  My divorce was so contentious (I have a similar name as my father, and had my own related business, plus did work for my parents company) it strained my relationship with my parents so bad they sold out and I haven't spoken with them in many years.  My family had been very close and I usually had Thanksgiving at my home for 40+ people.

But my life is different now post divorce - most importantly, a new business that has zero assets and it's all my labor where I have a small bespoke clientele and I stop taking customers when I get to a certain $ threshold.  That threshold is set by my ex, who has a job where her salary is publicly discoverable.  I refuse to make a penny over that because making less than her is an affirmative defense in family court against spousal support.

My divorce consumed my half of my accumulated equity (in legal fees to get rid of my ex who was representing herself per se and creating a lot of havoc)  and she got hers - which she deserved.  I'm totally okay with that.  But in my state she has lifetime recourse to come back for support because of the length of time we were married.  That causes me no small amount of anxiety.  So nowadays, I usually work a short three days a week and take it easy the rest of the time.  Enjoying my really wonderful life I've created.  But -frankly - a little bored because I really enjoyed it when I had 600 employees and a company that did $150M in revenue a year to look after.  

And I didn't mind my ex being in my wallet when we were married, but man did my opinion of her change in the three years it took to divorce her.  Somehow she expected me to continue to work like a dog and front a lifestyle for her - and me not be a part of it.  Yeah, no.  I mean, no.  You can figure it out yourself with your wallet.  You can't have mine anymore.

So, I know I'm not the only one who has this problem because I know lots of WOMEN who had to pay spousal support to the husband post divorce.   Except I got around it by making less and lowering my lifestyle.  So this isn't a sexist thing.  It's an spousal support thing.

And that's my question?  Am I the only one who does this?  Or did you make compromises that maximize your potential (it doesn't just have to be income, you could do it for visitation or any host of other reasons) did you take on as a result of your divorce?

All you need to know about that. I’m in my 30s and he’s in his 60s.

While he was treating me, he’s complained over time about his wife and tells me when she’s away and he finally gets to be alone in the house, over time has said things like I’m beautiful and an incredible person. Then he kept asking about my divorce and the details of it like how expensive was it, who to use, any advice like that (he knows many people, don’t know why he had to ask me). Anyway, so back in June my boyfriend proposed and he gasped and his face sunk and he said he thought I was breaking up with him. Then I showed him how he accidentally went down on both knees without thinking and he joked saying who wouldn’t want to go on both knees for you. 

Fast forward a couple months, he seemed to back off a bit but the compliments still came sometimes. He mentions random stuff like he’s financially comfortable, the reason I’m stressed is because I “decided to get engaged”, shows off his assets but in a fun way, not annoying or anything lol. He knows now I’m having second thoughts about my fiancé because he has a dark side that doesn’t seem to be getting better. I asked about his divorce and he said he’s going through it now but I’m the only one he’s told about it. 

My friend is worried he’s just trying to get in my pants (says it doesn’t matter he’s in his early 60s), but I’ve been in denial for a while over how I feel about him and it sucks. I don’t know how I should approach him to see what his intentions are with me. What’s your advice with that? And do you think it sounds like he has legit feelings?

A few months after I got on. I have been back on for a while so thought I would share what I have learned. M50. Covid evaporated a bunch of time so it’s not really 2 years. 
Please remember I  am writing from the male perspective. I know it may not be the same as the female perspective In some regards though I think there will be overlap. 
I have been on about 45+ first dates. Lots of second and 3rd. 2, 3month relationships with really great people. 
 
Things I’ve learned

- need to be nimble in terms of dating sites. 
started with Ok and match. Now I find far more people on bumble and hinge. 
- other people are working their own program. Don’t be offended if you get dropped from conversation. It happens to everyone. Don’t unmatch. People try something serious for date 5,6,7 and then come back. It’s not personal. None of it is. 
- I have more success with women 43-46 versus women 48-51.  not sure why. I am not sure if motivation is as high. Even on dates older ladies seem to be more “whatever” like wondering why they have to do this.
-guys say you love dogs in your profile. I would say 80% of women post with their dogs. 
-this applies to everyone. Conversations can’t be one sided. I can’t be asking all the questions. I lose interest. I try to show interest but when I get nothing back, no matter how great you look in your profile I just move on. 
-I think the sooner a date happens it works to be a big advantage. Subsequent communication goes smoother if the date goes well. Call it a first mover advantage. 
- as much as it seems like a good idea don’t have sex on date 2. You don’t know if you like the person and you end up in instant commitment. Or it does with me…. Then on date 4 it’s not a match. 🤦🏻‍♂️
- people overstate in their profiles so don’t be intimated. A high percentage say they are fit/athletic. That doesn’t really match up with what we see in real life. Which is fine but people are putting their best foot forward. The same thing with travel, people make it sound like they travel six months of the year. The average person probably gets no more than three weeks paid time off.  My point is don’t be intimidated don’t sell yourself short because they are up selling.  
-One thing I have bumped up against is people who are are separated or very very recently divorced. They say that they have their life all sorted out but often times, especially with kids they don’t really. There is still drama trying to get things sorted out with the kids in the ex. It’s pretty normal I think. I went through it with my kids early days. Sometimes I didn’t wanna go to their moms so I had to take them which may dating really complicated an unpredictable so I think it’s fair someone’s only been separated for seven months to tell them that you’ll like them but maybe come back in another another7 months. 
- respond reasonably quick if messaged. I know it’s not always possible. However, the faster communication happens it’s just another fruit first mover advantage. People that takes six days to reply to your initial question or comment kind of fall off for one reason or the other. I appreciate you may be busy but honestly I don’t think it takes that long to send a quick message. 

Observations

-if you are taking photos in your bedroom please make your bed that applies both males and females. Same with the bathroom just make sure the countertops are clean and tidy not crap everywhere. I know that’s a bit judgy but I’m just being honest I’ve heard it from lots of other people as well that it’s gross if your place looks cluttered and messy
-if you are taking pictures and you’re using older ones make sure they don’t have a wedding ring on, it creates a lot of confusion.
-with some rare exceptions there may be an age where bathing suit photos don’t work unless you’re playing beach volleyball or some thing. Idk…..
-Guys, I hear women constantly tell me that they’re not interested in pictures of you with your fish or your latest kill hunting, just a thought. 
-I know it’s been discussed before. But putting what you don’t want in somebody comes across really negatively better to talk about the things that you do want. I know things like smoking drug use alcoholism or all non-negotiables however I’m not sure those need to be in your profile. It starts pointing to some of your past experiences which should be brought up I’m just not sure that’s the place for them. I could be entirely wrong on this but when I read profiles like this I usually move past them. Maybe it’s just me. 
-I think it’s important to remember that  career matters in terms of matches. I know it probably shouldn’t matter what we do for a profession but it’s interesting that I’ve never had anybody who’s not a professional swipe right on me. I don’t think it’s a coincidence I just think it’s a bit of fact of life, I think it goes both ways as well, just  an observation. 

This is long!  If any women (or men) have different observations or counter points to any of my points please feel free to add. I’m not here to start a fight or get an argument just my observations on having gone on several dates.

For context, I (48M) have been divorced and dating for three years. In that time, I have really liked 3 people (one was short-lived as she went back to her Ex) and the other two were relationships of some duration (6 mos. and 9 mos., respectively).

The two relationships and the two women both had a lot of similarities, an eery amount. Both experienced a significant amount of childhood trauma with turbulent upbringings, and had some Dad issues, both had challenging Ex situations that were allegedly the guys fault, both had moved about 45 minutes from a small town into the city, both had gotten to a reasonably objective level of professional success and stability for their kids,, both were very spiritual, Yoga/namaste/astrology types and very vested in personal improvement, both wanted to write a book to tell their story to empower other women, both were fresh out of their previous circumstances, both were very sexual and forthright about their appetite, etc., etc. The list goes on and on.

I just had a first lunch/brunch date with a 3rd woman that had childhood trauma, challenging Ex situation, reasonably successful, spiritual, that wants to write a book. 

Seriously, I am like what is happening here? Is there a glitch in the matrix? To be fair to the women, I am pretty high EQ for a man, an adult child of an alcoholic (which presents consistent patterns), and I present myself pretty well physically and conversationally.

We’re still living in the same house, wrapping up financial investments &amp; trying to be civil while we complete a joint business venture. We’ll be done with one of us moved out of our home by the end of September. This breakup has been a longtime in the works but we put it off and played family, as we were too tied up together and slowly separating things.

(Just giving context for the next part so I don’t sound like a cheater)

Completely by accident I met a man (46M) on an anonymous website. We spent months chatting here &amp; there and had endless things in common. He approached me with a private message and shared his photo. We started talking through text and on the phone, and after about 3 months we’ve logged hundreds of hours of talking &amp; chatting.

He knows my full real scenario. (So does the man I live with). I’m not lying or hiding anything. He told me at the outset that he wasn’t interested in rushing into anything &amp; had decided to be friends with the next woman he dated for months &amp; maybe even up to a year.

He has floated eventually meeting in a certain place, that we originally bonded over being interested in. Kind of a romantic thing I thought. I said probably not until next year so I can move on from my current life properly.

Things have gone faster than I thought and I’m going to be a free &amp; clear single woman soon. We’ve started talking about meeting for reals &amp; actually making plans for about 6wks from now.

But he’s started to seem distant. I notice I’m always texting first. He keeps talking about the trip we’ll take and saying “oh I’m always looking for an activity partner” and very clearly stated that he’s not interested in my looks (he’s seen dozens of photos of me, and when we’ve spoken on FaceTime he tells me I’m so gorgeous). And now he’s a bit less responsive and only wants to talk on the phone late at night when he’s high.

And I’ll think he’s not interested anymore, but then the next time we speak he will be very flirtatious again and I’m just confused.

I’ve never “dated” a man over 30. The “dating” phase of my last relationship, the guy was 27 when we got together.

He's always been my ABSOLUTE favorite celebrity chef and I was devastated when he committed suicide.  HBO is coming out with a new documentary called Roadrunner so I decided to finally read his book as I never read any of them.  One of the things I loved about him was what a fascinating and amazing storyteller he was.  I felt like I could die happy sitting happily at his feet listening to him just tell stories all day.

For the first time in my dating life (if you could call it that since I stopped during covid haha) it finally dawned on me that passionate people are really what make my heart sing because I felt truly happy reading his words and hearing his stories and realized I want more of that.  There are other things I like as well like intelligence and ambition but passion is REALLY where that inexplicable feeling of fascination comes from with me.  

I am a big believer that we have to be the type of person to attract those that we want.  Pre Covid I was.  I was flashy, sexy, passionate and filled with a natural curiosity.  Reading that book made me realize I no long am any of those things and kinda just go about my day and then go to sleep.  If you are passionate how do you keep that going through Covid?  If you used to be and have felt it wane how do you get your groove back so to speak?
