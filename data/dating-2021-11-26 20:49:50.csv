I'm just too empty and too disgusted. I always loathed this kind of life. It turns out it was easy to judge without getting my hands dirty.  I am starting to feel sluggish in the morning when I normally worked out, so this is starting to interfere with my life more deeply. Usually I line up matches before the week starts, I just malfunction and give in. I genuinely need someone to smack my face and remind me to not behave like a pig.

I keep in contact with the girls I sleep with, but only as friends. Suffice to say, I might be the worst friend there is.

4,r348kn,1637983868,"(18F) Bad at telling whether something is a red flag or normal, bad at telling whether I'm sensitive/reasonable, worried I won't fix my issues and I'll never find the ""right person""","I don't want to label my family as toxic because they've done a lot for me, and I wouldn't be where I am now because of them. My parents didn't grow up in the best conditions, and most of the things that my grandparents couldn't provide for my parents, my parents ended up providing for me and my brother. So I don't want to blame my parents for my problems.

I'm proud of who I've become because of them (holding high standards for myself, working hard, etc). But at the same time, there are some things about relationships (not just dating but in general) that I need to work on, mainly

* I panic when I see people express slight anger or displeasure and rush to defuse the situation with jokes, compliments, etc until they calm down
* I feel super uncomfortable expressing any form of displeasure, and I always feel like I have to apologize for my tone and lay on a bunch of good words about the person immediately afterwards just to appear nonthreatening. In my friend groups, it's normal for two people to have conflict, make up really quickly (within the same day), and go back to the way it was as if nothing happened. But when I make a complaint, people are shocked because it's ""not what I'm supposed to do"" and I'm ""the nice and sweet person, what happened?"" and there's an awkward atmosphere for the next few days despite me reassuring them that it's not a big deal.
* Sometimes, I can't tell casual ribbing from toxic jokes, but these days, I'm better at hinting to people that they've went too far rather than silently keeping it to myself like my younger self did
* When people volunteer to do kind things for me, I feel really uncomfortable, partly because I feel wrong receiving things without giving in return, partly because I'm scared it'll be held against me later on. There's a side of me that wonders whether it's to guilt-trip me or to manipulate me into doing something I don't want to do. I tell this side of me to shut up and accept the nice thing. In the past, my parents would tell me they'd give me something, I'd tell them I didn't need it, they'd go ahead and prepare it for me anyway, then use it as a reason to become upset with me when I didn't do something else for them later on
* Unless someone behaves outrageously (yelling, throwing things), I can't tell whether distancing myself from them is a reasonable move on my end or whether I'm just being too sensitive

Also, the stress of aligning what I'm looking for in a partner with what my family is looking for is difficult. My parents want me to find someone of the same race, same major, an academic superstar (like top 5% of the class) and at least X inches taller than me. I'm looking for someone who's honest, kind, and easygoing. That's literally it. I share some of my parents' standards, but not to the same extreme: same race and major might make the person more relatable, but I don't mind dating outside of my race/major as long as we respect each other's cultures and area of work. And as someone who is great at academics, I do like someone who takes their education seriously, but I really don't think it's necessary for them to be at the very top of the class as long as they're sound enough to figure out most real-world problems on their own, which a lot of people can. The height requirement frustrates me because it doesn't have anything to do with the person's character and is out of their control.

For now, I'm focused on building myself, my hobbies, and my career. I don't go out of my way to find romantic relationships; when people happen to ask me out and I think they're p cool too, I say yes and see where it goes.

I'm noticing a common pattern where I meet a guy who seems genuinely kind, we get close, and my gut starts telling me something is wrong (he starts criticizing me, he gives off controlling vibes, etc.), or any of the issues I listed above (me panicking when he seems angry, feeling uncomfortable about complaining, feeling taken aback by a joke that doesn't feel like friendly banter, feeling obligated to do something because I feel like he's done a lot for me). I'm constantly on watch, can't tell whether something is a red flag / abusive and I should leave, or whether it's normal and I should work through it.

Because of this, I haven't officially locked myself into a relationship with anyone yet, but I know that I want to settle down and raise a family somewhere down the line, so dating is something I need to get better at eventually. I really don't want to marry the wrong guy and repeat the emotional pain I went through in my childhood, but I also don't want to be the highly sensitive, picky person who ends up single forever because she can't accept other people's flaws. I know I'm young and it's early to be thinking about this, but again it's something I can't avoid forever.

I'm really at a loss of how I can get better? How can I tell whether someone is being reasonable, when to trust my judgement, etc? I get that these are really difficult questions that can't be easily answered which is why I put it under ""support needed"" instead of advice, haha I just need to vent thanks for listening",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r348kn/18f_bad_at_telling_whether_something_is_a_red/

15,r357yx,1637987054,Is it just entertainment for him?,"So a year ago a guy messaged me on a dating app. It turns out he was 10 years younger (he’s in his 30’s but of course his profile said he was older). I figured he was just playing around but he started phoning multiple times a week and FaceTiming (so I know he’s real).l was surprised by how many hours we talked so I figured maybe we would go on a date. We talked about all sorts of stuff and seemed to have some connection.

He talked about how busy he was and of course every meeting fell through (various reasons including covid). 

Eventually it tapered off and I stopped messaging as it seemed pointless because he never made the effort to meet and he started to fade away. I noticed he always seemed to be on the dating site so why waste my time if he doesn’t want to meet.

I would laugh because he messaged every 6 weeks. Every time I thought oh haven’t heard from him he would pop up with a low investment message.

So when he messaged last I asked if he wanted to meet for a FWB night. Figured I had nothing to lose. He phoned me right away for another hour long phone call catching up. He said he was totally down for that but is crazy busy and will message when he knows he can make it.

So today I sent a short and flirty message and he’s left me on read. It feels like he is playing games. 

Is it just the fantasy he’s after? It’s feeling like he just wants the validation.

I had thought it would be fun to have a night of passion but I am not sure it’s worth it as he does the hot/cold with messaging.

Before the date, he mentioned he liked seeing girls in yoga pants and that he wanted to see me do yoga. I was a little weirded out by that but gave him a cold reply to show my distaste about this topic.  

During the date, he again mentioned his goal was to see me in yoga pants, despite the topic being my life goals (wtf). He was also crossing boundaries and touched my hair and shoulders often. Again, I made it clear that we should start off seeing each other as friends. I wanted to get to know him as a person and it felt like he just wanted to objectify me instead of listening to me.

In addition, he talked shit about his ex, saying that she was hot but too wild for him. He boasted about how she couldn’t get over him for months after he told her that they should stop meeting. He also said mean things about a guy that used to like me, calling him short and a nerd. 

Overall, I finished the date feeling unappreciated and harassed. He never asked if I was okay with his touching and he was never actually listening, basically he talked about himself a lot. I couldn’t sleep that night and cried the next day knowing that I was basically on high alert because the entire date just felt so inappropriate and so distasteful.

31,r371zo,1637993529,I fell in love with the one who got away,"
While I was in grad school I immediately connected with a woman who befriended me early on in the program. We were on track to becoming really close until one night our relationship turned a little sour. 

From this point on, she became more defensive and so did I. But one night she revealed to me that she felt hurt by something that I did that night our relationship turned sour, but she didn’t want it to get in the way of our relationship because our friendship was important to her at the time. Unfortunately, I still acted defensive and our relationship remained contentious over the duration of our program. There were times where we clearly were close, but there was always tension. For example, she would stand by my side when we were out but maybe we wouldn’t really talk.

Anyway, we graduated and are on separate career paths. We still periodically talk (a life update or a “happy holidays”) but nothing that indicates a really close relationship. 

Looking back, I have come to understand that I had fallen in love with her, but at the time I did not know how to process all the ways she would make me feel and so I put up a guard against her and acted liked she didn’t impact me when she did. I recognize now that out of all the women I have had relationships with, she is the only one that has made me feel deeply and strongly.

I would like to tell her this, but have no idea how without being random or maybe being seen as “creepy” or delusional even.

I wish I could get over this, but I get so unmotivated and lonely that I just start to cease functioning right. I've been shouldering problems and giving advice to my friends for as long as I can remember, but nobody can ever solve mine. So please, help me. I'll even accept criticism.

I had someone I liked in middle school and I got a whole bunch of roses from my own flower shop and gave them to everyone. I was going to give my red rose to her, but this asshole did it instead. He gave a white and she gave it back and took a red one instead. It was beautiful, but I felt horrible. I tried to go with someone else instead when I reached high school, but this is where the weird stuff happens.

This new person already had someone, so I wanted to be friends instead because well... what else are you going to do? Well, she said yes, except she would always do weird stuff like caressing my face and stuff. Friends don't do that! Finally, before she graduates I write to her a letter saying that, ya, I like her. But I can't get in the way and I'm a problem to her friend circle so we should just say goodbye with no regrets. Well...

She tells me my letter was disgusting. Wtf? And just leaves. Then some girls pin me to a wall trying to hump me IN FRONT OF THE PAST GIRL I LIKED WTF?! Then tells me I liked it because I'm a man. Yep, double broken heart, molested and I'm the jerk apparently. My friends all reveal they want me too (including a guy friend) and I say no so they all leave me. I'm not making this shit up. It continues in college too! I try to get over my school trauma, and the next couple people I date either ignore me, take my valentines chocolate and run away never to be seen again, or bring their friends along to scope me out ON A DATE.

All of this happened, and I still don't even know what a kiss is like. People keep wanting to use me instead of love me. And no, please don't use my story for some man rights shit. That's not what this is about. I'm emotionally hungry, but I really don't feel comfortable with expressing myself to anyone now.

Women that are like 5'5 and under flock to me than anything and I ask them if they like guys that aren't tall, specifically guys that are short. They say no and they never are interested in them. I get A LOT of these women saying this. I personally find it a huge turn off and I actually like taller women myself like at least 5'7 cause it'd just way more comfortable. I have short friends that are guys and they're with taller women and very happy with each other. Also seen a few guy that was something like 5'2 and under with tall women, they seemed happy. The tall women I talk to say they also have competition with shorter women and they realize that guys like shorter women more, they say their cuter etc... so taller women are in the same boat and they can look past height whereas with short women, they can afford to be picky and a lot of them are obsessed with height. I've never really gotten this vibe from taller women, it's interesting. Shoot your shot bros.

37,r37et9,1637994814,Feeling a bit of mixed signals and unsure what to do.,"I matched with a girl several weeks ago, sorta hit it off via conversation and met up for dinner 2 weeks earlier. I think it went alright (prob not the best match for me personality wise but thought I’d give it more of a shot), wasn’t too sure if she felt the same, but she asked for a hug and we went our ways after. 

I did end up texting her later that night stating I had a great time and would love to take her to this squid game pop up pub, which she agreed to and said similar thoughts. But since the first date it sorta felt lackluster conversation wise and definitely was me that had to keep the conversation going, or initiate. Eventually she had to bail a few days before the 2nd date cause she got quite sick (thankfully tested negative for Covid). No biggie, sorta kept some convos up here and there but definitely wasn’t consistent.

The only time she initiated the convo since was on thanksgiving when she wished me a happy thanksgiving and all, but otherwise it feels quite one sided in terms of initiation.

Typically what do you guys normally do or feel when things kinda shifts one way. Do you slowly lose interest or just keep initiating until you’re sure?

I've known this girl for many... years (we almost had a thing when we met but then we drifted apart for years). I've been talking to her since February, first she was very interested, we planned trips, watched series at the same time, talked all day and every day. Then since August she started ghosting me a bit and one day as a joke I told her about that trip we planned and she basically told me that she probably won't save that kind of money in 2022, so everything was off. We have met a couple of times (she lives in another state) and sometimes I think she is interested in me because she wants to talk a lot but other times everything is fucked up, she barely responds and I of course get very angry. I think it's important to say that next year she's moving to Switzerland for a year for studies (she's really looking forward to going there) and I'm sure I won't see her in that period of time and of course this weird thing I've noticed (I'm not really a stalker), apparently some Swiss guy has been commenting on her pictures and I related it to something she said about a European guy she met online but didn't talk to her much. I'm starting to think she probably just wants to see this Swiss guy, they might be onto something or maybe I've been in the friendzone all this time.

Point is as I am in a relationship with her. She is totally affection less person. Always get angry. Like whenever you met her. She is mad! I tired to talk with her.

57,r38oyc,1637999771,I’m (23F) feeling down about myself after learning my bf (31M) follows a bunch of Instagram models,"Hi, I know this is a topic that comes up pretty frequently in this sub and I read all the posts but also wanted to get some feedback about my specific situation. So my boyfriend and I started dating around the end of August and things have been great. 

In the beginning I recall him mentioning I was different from his ex in that we openly discuss our sexual preferences and that I don’t care if he watches porn (which is true, and I watch porn myself). 

A few weeks ago I saw while he was scrolling next to me a few Instagram models on his feed in bikinis. I think I’d be less bothered if it was an account for something specific like a fitness page of a girl who just happens to also have a banging body, but most of them he follows it’s clear the one purpose is to just be sexy and basically soft core porn. 

When I told him I have 0 problem with watching porn, I meant it because to me porn is like a show with actors and actresses doing a performance. Also, people mostly watch porn while they’re actively masturbating and when they’re done, it gets put away until the next time that itch needs to be scratched.

Here’s why I think I’m bothered by the Instagram models: to me it seems more real since Instagram is also an outlet used for family and friends, so having the two mixed together makes real life and these sexy models intertwined, since in your feed you could have a picture of your baby niece and the next picture is of one of these models with perfect bodies, and it’s a constant stream of images as opposed to porn which has a time and a place. 

Because of this, while I can understand that porn is just a fantasy/entertainment and sometimes things we like sexually can be strange and not what we like outside of any other setting, the Instagram models make it seem like that is what he ACTUALLY likes in women since it’s a part of his everyday life/routine. And it makes me feel really shitty.

I had mentioned this somewhat casually because I wanted to gauge his reaction before diving into a serious convo about it, and he mentioned how one of his friends’ girlfriends made him unfollow the Instagram models and my bf said it seemed controlling. I forget exactly how the convo went but I do remember him saying “I’m not unfollowing them like he did” and “I followed them while I was single” I was like well that was great. I dropped it because it was clear that if I tried to continue it would turn into an argument at that time. 

Also I just want to make a note about how we met: we met on Reddit when he slid in my dms after I made a post in r/cuddle buddies but also had made more… risqué posts in a few local groups. So ever since then he’ll bring it up and be like “oh did you hang out with your Reddit boys today” or if I forget something we talked about he’ll say “you getting me and your other Reddit boyfriends mixed up again?” And these comments don’t really bug me because we poke fun at each other all the time, but what does bother me is I feel it’s in the same ballpark as me mentioning my discomfort with the insta models, but when I do it he gets actually upset annoyed about it. Also want to note since we’ve started dating I’ve never reached out to anyone else and deleted the posts. 

So all that being said, are my feelings justified? I was able to bring it up in a more serious light and I was able to express more directly that while I’m not going to make him unfollow them because he’s free to make his own choices, I did make it clear that it made me insecure. While he wasn’t argumentative this time we discussed it, he still couldn’t see why it bothered me and basically said “I don’t know what to say.” Later I brought up us watching porn together because it’s something we’ve done before and he said no it’s weird now because I’m weird about the Instagram models. I told him I wasn’t lying when I said I was totally fine about him watching porn and reiterated basically what I said above that they’re very different to me. He said “I guess in my man brain I just can’t see the difference and there’s nothing you can say that’ll make
me be able to see it differently” so once again I just dropped it.

Just want to add he’s very affectionate toward me and has never made me feel bad about myself or compared me to them. After some of these conversations he has made it clear that he likes my body the way it is and he finds me sexy and he absolutely is attracted to me, even though my body is definitely different from the insta models since I am much less filled out. These words helped but I still can’t help but be bothered by them, partly because based on what he said about his friend’s girlfriend, he sees it more as a control issue as well as not being able to see why I think it’s different from porn. Any and all advice is appreciated!

TL;DR: I’m insecure that my bf follows insta models because it seems far more “real” and closer to his everyday life, and he can’t see how it could make me insecure if I’m not bothered by him watching porn.

 I don’t necessarily need my family to “approve” of my relationship per se, and they would never stop me from following my heart, but they have expressed some concerns over our relationship. For instance, he is jobless and has no schooling under his belt. I have a degree and am extremely self motivated and at times have had three jobs at once, so my family worries we may be incompatible there. He also doesn’t like hanging out with my family and would prefer to spend time alone. Generally, I feel like my family is just unimpressed with my partner and think I deserve better. Their concerns are starting to make me doubt my relationship as well. I’ve brought up these things with my partner and he completely shuts down and acts like I’m being ridiculous for wanting him to care about impressing my family. He just doesn’t care.

I do have a tendency to fall in love quickly but I'd always need to fight for that affection back and it made love, and opening up about my feelings, very scary.

Things with my bf are different though, he gives back the same energy I give him, he cares about making me happy, and told me a few weeks ago that he feels safe with me. After a drinking a few glasses of wine, I just felt the need to tell him how I felt. I was less scared because of the wine but being with him makes me feel a lot less scared in general. He told me he loved me too and I just started bawling, I was just so overwhelmed with emotion. I just never thought this would happen for me.

He said ""everything is just so easy with you,"" and it is, falling for him and being with him just makes sense. We had a lot more gushy things to say but it was an incredible experience and I wanted to share it. Since it's a private moment, I don't really know how to explain it to others and because it's early it feels odd to share it with others.

But different cities and we never met. I asked her about this. But he didn't get the opportunity. Idk

Point is that I am in a relationship with her. She is an affection less person. Always get angry. Like whenever you met her. She is mad! I tried to talk with her. She told that in the past she spent hard times with her family and her last relationship was toxic that when she show her affection. her ex didn't respond to her well. So, she become rude now. ""It takes time to get me back to the old position,"" She said.

Because of her rudeness and her all-time bad behaviour with me. I blocked her from everywhere because it was too much for me to handle. But she called me from her friend social and all. She promised me that it will never happen again. She will change. But we are still in that position. 

As you guys have been in a relationship you will know that affection is a big part of the relationship. If I wrote something. I mean it and I want a good loveable response, not just a seen tick.

I've never date before in my entire life. So if u could compare ur experience to mine, that'd be appreciated. Fyi: i told him since the beginning i only looked for new people to talk too, and he said he's too.

Here goes:

First meet- lunch, he tried to put his arm around me on this first meet (was questioning his intention but i went with the flow anyways)

Second meet/date? - drinks at a bar then back to his place, we watched tv, made out, he tried to get into my pants, cuddled - I went back home when it got late

Later, I told him I'm not looking for just casual sex. I know he still see other girls because we aren't exclusive. But he said he wanted more than just sex from me. I thought he might wanna get into a relationship, but I also know he is a poly. 

Third meet- was gonna go out together but i was late so i met him at his place. I didnt plan to have sex with him, but we did have sex... He said i can sleepover but i didnt.

Fourth meet- we went out to have icecream then back to his place to chill. I told him i didnt wanna have sex. He instead blindfolded and handcuff me and used sex toys on me. We didnt have sex. But is this way too fast?? 

I know this really sounds like casual, he always tried to get me into bed. But I also like him so While i wanna end it with him, i also wanna continue to see where it goes.

A couple months later he randomly messaged me saying hi and we started to chat. It was a little hard at first because he isn't fluent in English, but we managed to chat in simple english/Hindi with a translator and got along quite well. We flirted a bit and it was clear that he liked me. Then about a week after he first messaged me, we were chatting and he asked me who I want to marry. I said I don't know, and asked who he wanted to marry, to which he replied ""you"". I didn't know what to say so I said I wanted to marry him, too (yes I know, dumb idea). We talked about it for a bit and I told him he should really think about if I was good enough to be his wife and if he was really sure he wanted to marry me. He said he would and the next time we chatted I asked if he thought about it. He said he had and that he was sure. I then reminded him that I'm Christian and he's Hindu, which would be difficult, but he didn't seem too concerned, and that we would have to wait at least a year until I'm 18, which he said was fine and that we had plenty of time. I asked if his family would hate me for being Christian (hoping to discourage him) and he said yes, but that there wasn't anything to do about it. Nothing seemed to discourage him. We talked more and the idea was that if we got married I would go to India, wear a saree and help him with his shop. I told him I was going on a trip (which I did) and that I would talk to him when I got home. That gave me time to think about all this, and I don't know what to do. I like him and maybe in the future would consider marrying him, but for heaven's sake after one week! I keep thinking he must have some ulterior motive here, but he's not at all interested in coming to America, so I don't think he has the ""green-card motive"", and every thing I said to try to discourage him did nothing. Even the thought of going against his parents wishes didn't change his mind. Is there something I'm overlooking here? Does he just want to marry me because I'm white?

So basically I (31m) met 30f online. We went out once for dinner, then drinks at the bar afterwards. It was a pretty good date and we were discussing setting up another. Long story short, I have Boost mobile and the cell towers I was on were shut down. They had to send me a new sim card which took FOREVER to get to me. In the meantime I was using the backup 3g network. It was slow, but it was still sending texts. Or so I thought.

Our planned 2nd date was to go to the aquarium. I told her that they only sell timed tickets and they need to be purchased in advanced. She okay'd this. Day of the date she calls and tells me she's sick and has been throwing up (she sounded terrible). We continued talking and everything seemed normal.

I didn't hear from her for a week so I assumed she lost interest. I sent her a text saying she can just have her aquarium ticket if she wants it. Still not response. A couple days later, I was kind of mad, feeling like she set me up to buy the ticket with no intention of going, so I confronted her about it. She responded in like 15 seconds, something like ""ummm I haven't heard from you in a week I thought we were going to go"". I apologized for my text and explained the situation, she was cool about it. I confirmed through my mom's phone that some texts weren't sent/received.

So...I realize this sounds like a lot of bs. Postponing a date, undelivered text messages, but all evidence points to this being true. I gave up on this girl when she wasn't responding and went out with somebody else from Hinge, we're also planning another date. I suck at dating multiple people at a time so I'm not sure what to do. The girl is currently out of state with her family for Thanksgiving, but she wants to go out when she gets back. **Is this situation just to complicated to fix at this point?**

I'm a thirty year old dude. I work at a tabletop game store - we sell board games, D&amp;D, Magic, stuff like that. In the last couple months, we've had a new customer, and I find her pretty interesting and attractive. She'll come in every once in a while with one of her friends, chat with us at the counter, and buy some stuff before they head out. I'd like to get to know her better, but I have some worries.  


See, game stores like mine have a somewhat justified reputation for being unfriendly or unwelcoming to women. Even my store, which has a better reputation in that regard, is a sausagefest on the best of days. I'd hate to chase away one of our few female regulars by coming on too strong.

It’s been respectively 9, and 7yrs for the charges. Should I give this guy a chance?","I know FML for being so dumb. And because I am dumb, I apologize. But if you can advise, I’d really appreciate it!! 

We hooked up and he wasn’t at all rough; he was kind and consensual, I was just curious about this person. I never in my life thought I would find out this when pulling him up. I know my parents and friends would freak out if they knew, hell I’m even freaking out now. But he seemed so normal in person and sweet😩. He never told me his last name and I didn’t ask, I think that was my mistake. Now I know! I am just really new to online dating and was being really dumb all la di da da, never thought this situation would happen to me especially cause he seemed super chill, but I could be seeing behind rose colored lens rn just cause I like him. 

I don’t feel comfortable being something serious with him but in the time we’ve spent together he’s genuinely a kind hearted guy. I’ve only spent my time in public places with him and hooked up once. I’m curious what you as guys think of this situation, what would you advise me? This happened when he was 18 and 20. He hasn’t brought it up, I found out, searched his first name and town out of curiosity. Idk what he will say if I bring it up. I also wanted to have kinky sex with him, bdsm, our first time was very generic and fun. I’ve talked about it openly and we were thinking of starting a fwb situation. Now I’m not so sure. He had a relationship before he says for 1 year and a half. Should I asked him what happened with that, before continuing or just cut my losses. 

I’m a very communicative person and so I’ve talked a lot about consent in things and what not and sex talk is an open book policy for me which he seems to respect. I don’t know what to think. I would like to see him again but I need to know the details of the charges of which are not available for me to see. I’m not looking to go into things fast with him either or anything serious, currently just dating people and am in the thought camp that people can change. 


I may be naive and that is why I am asking for your guy’s help in understanding what the best route is to take. I’m not looking to ever get serious with him but he seems an awesome dude, I’m also not the type to fall head over heels and get this guy to move in with me either. I know that is just trouble, over a long term I believe we could have a cool friendship. I’m really interested in people and do not shame people for their past, it seems he hasn’t been able to do normal couple activities because of this and have some sort of intimacy/emotional support which I think is really important to have for a while, he likes hanging out with me and I do too. 

I’d like to share that with him but I also don’t want him around my family, I have a little sister I am protective of and don’t plan on bringing him around them. Although I’m really open with my mom, so I will possibly tell her about it. 

I have definitely learned my lesson from online dating and will look up everyone from now on! 

Do you guys think, it is safe for me to give him a chance? I know I’m trying to rationalize my hooking up with him but I just am really in shock, I can’t believe I slept with him without him telling me. 

To be fair I wanted it and he was so sweet to me, I asked him if he has fantasies to use swear words for dirty talk in role play. He told me no, he thinks it’s degrading to women. 


Please tell me your thoughts. Do you have friends in this position what is their character like? Do you believe I can give this guy a chance or is it a lost cause? I’m dating other people I just can’t. Get over this situation. I know I can just forget about him, and move on but I mean I always have hope in people. 

He has not told me the above details at all, I found out myself.  He also says he’s a reformed alcoholic and past weed smoker but has stopped and looking to better himself. I’m not I that into those things and when we go out he doesn’t want to drink and acknowledges that drugs inhibit clear thinking and it’s something he wants to get away from. He wants to do things sober. I’m all for it because I’m straight edge. I applaud him for being honest with me on that front, I told him we could do lots of fun things sober and sexy things too. We discussed having a light and fun casual relationship because neither of us want long term. 


I’m not leading him on that I’d be in a long term exclusive relationship with him either ; but I feel I would and could be a friend to him.  I don’t know what constitutes indecent exposure either so there’s that, I’d have to ask him to explain. What advice would you give your sister in similar shoes? I have been known to be very kind, maybe I need to just step away, and take this as a learning experience to not be so naive.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r39wpw/need_advice_asap_found_out_the_guy_im_casually/
70,r39x2a,1638004818,I had a romantic moment with a stranger and not sure what to make of it?," TL;DR - Young lad had an intense romantic encounter with a stranger, needs help processing it.

Hi all

A little context about me: I (24/m) have been single for close to 9 months now. My last relationship, even though quite healthy, ended due to me not being over my first ex/attachment (of almost four years). In the last year, I have focused on building my habits, understanding what makes me happy and building friendships over time. I have been quite successful for the most part, except right now I don't feel the need to have a relationship with someone. I have this belief in my head that once I settle down into a better foundation for my life (career, health, etc.) I'll be ready to commit to someone. Anyway, let's come to the story now:

Few days ago, I was at the airport waiting for my flight. I was just coming from a wedding and felt the classic ""damn, I do miss being intimate with someone"" feeling. Right then, I saw one of the prettiest girls ever. I walked up to her and started talking. Soon, we were bonding over many things and she offered to sit next to me. I was delighted. It had been a while since I felt a little spark of sorts inside with someone I didn't know!

The flight took off and we started getting deeper into our pasts, aspirations, things that made us click. And then, there was the moment - she asked me what was I thinking. I smiled and told her in all honesty, ""it has been a while since I felt this attracted to anyone, let alone a stranger!""

She leaned in, and we kissed! I felt all the butterflies in the world, so high up in the sky. We held hands and talked more. Once we landed, she kept holding my hand and hugged me several times. Finally, it was time for us to leave. She looked me in the eye and said that next time when she thinks about marrying someone, I'll be someone she'll think of. ""You remind me of innocence"". We discussed how its probably not possible for us to have something in the future because of the distance, but would still like to keep in touch.

And like that, she left.

Now, I know this sounds like something straight out of a romantic novel but I swear all of this happened in those few hours and I'm still processing it. She's 3-4 years older to me and I know we will never meet again (due to the distance), but boy did I feel a lot of things. I couldn't stop smiling for the next day (and more!)

I'm not sure if this counts as something intimate or casual, since I have only had two strong intimate relationships in my life. I always 'liked' the idea of casual relationships but never knew if I am emotionally mature to hold those.

Going forward, I would like to have more such moments with people, even if we don't choose to commit. What do you guys think of this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r39x2a/i_had_a_romantic_moment_with_a_stranger_and_not/

78,r3aqda,1638008296,How to date with OCD and low IQ?,"Hello everyone, I was diagnosed with OCD a while back. If you don't know what that is I'll elaborate briefly, from my POV. Basically, I experience unwanted, recurring, and distressing thoughts almost constantly. To deal with this I preform mental and physical routines subconsciously. They are my way of self soothing, but they are usually problematic to varying degrees. For example, at night time, I used to obsessively fear that my mom was dead. I then would compulsively wake her up to make sure she was alive. If I didn't do that I would end up have panic attacks. The fear was irrational and recurring, and the compulsion was problematic. 

  My OCD is a major issue when it comes to talking to females. But to add to that issue, my IQ is considerably lower than average.(79).
So if you can envision this, I am an overly anxious, weird, idiot. Not a great recipe for getting a date. 
From my perspective, there is a huge disconnect between me, and women. Not that I'm cold or unloving, just blatantly different. Due to this I really have no experience with females. I have no idea how to talk to them, and no idea how to build a close relationship. 
I'm convinced a girlfriend is something I need. I believe a healthy and loving relationship would help my social, spiritual and physical health. But I need help to achieve this, I need to overcome some obstacles.

Somehow he took forever to reply back and set exact time/ date, we ended up seeing each other at a few more parties. He texted it was nice to see me and wanted to get to know me more next year.

He never texted all summer long except one time to check which group I am in and if I had signed up to his same group. 

During the school year, he wouldn't texted much, maybe once a week, but if he sees me at school he would ask what I was up to this weekend, but he wouldn't ask me out or anything. He did that like 3-4 times on different weeks. Eventually he asked me out over text. We had lunch and split the bill. He did express wanting to repeat this when we don't have many exams.

I bumped into him a couple times at school and would invite him to study with me.

So matched, we were talking to each but pretty chill, mostly just small talk. I told him it was sad he wasn’t it my city and he said he would have come one weekend for sure. We spoke seldomly but now and then but mostly just what we are up to. This Wednesday he hit me up saying that he had time to visit my city and we confirmed to have a dinner and a walk. 

He actually booked a restaurant, we had a very nice time, then we were walking down the streets, city is extremely romantic. Then we went to his place as it was late already and I live far and we hang out there just having a discussion, but discussion in real life was much more intense (work, educations, goals) . 

Then the sexual tension built up, we had some drinks and extremely romantic atmosphere and during second part of the night we slept together. Was very sensual and hot; we did several rounds. 

In the morning we spent some time together, was pretty good but a bit awkward from my side as I’ve never slept with anyone that soon. 

Should I just accept that if it’s the first date it will be a one night stand or might anything work from it? I liked him a lot. What should be the steps if I want to get to know him more?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3b68b/sex_on_the_first_date_should_i_forget_him/

My boyfriend recently failed a semester of school. This affected him mentally. He suffers from depression. We have been together one year. 

Now he does not care about his future or school and he has told me this.

I decided to ask him not too long ago what he’s planning on doing with his life - whether it’s getting a job, going to school, changing majors, anything. 

I asked because things like this are important to me. 

I’m already working full time and I plan on further advancing my career. I don’t want to be a sugar mama and I don’t want to date a man who stays home all day. 

He replied to me Angrily (it’s happened more than once) and said what I asked him was “disrespectful”. 

He then said that he doesn’t care about anything and doesn’t give a F about school. 

Am i wrong in asking my boyfriend things like this?

He doesn’t work, and is not in school for now. Honestly he does help his family with a company they own and he is very family oriented.. but most times he is home and has tons of free time. He has no stable income and has no plans on furthering his own life.

I get the feeling that since he does not really work or study - he makes it up by taking me on dates and giving me his full attention. This I always appreciate since I always come home from work wanting to vent and wanting a person to rely on and get love from. This is one of the few reasons why I haven’t left. He’s there for me..

TLDR; my bf has no goals and i get him upset when I ask nicely about what he’s planning on doing",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3bpzs/23_f_and_22_m_it_is_wrong_to_ask_my_boyfriend/
89,r3bqyo,1638012602,How do I improve my look?,"All my life, my mom has implied a lot I’m ugly or plain, and I’m inclined to think she’s right since I don’t rlly have any friends. It’s just super hard for me to make friends, and I’ve never had any sort of friend group. It doesn’t help that I’ve always been socially awkward. In public, I’m definitely seen as invisible, and in pictures I am not pretty. I tried getting into makeup and fashion, but I’ve come to realize that my face just isn’t the best. In the end, that’s what matters. Does anyone have tips on how to be more attractive other than plastic surgery?

97,r3clpz,1638016080,Why finding a signifcant other seems unattainable,"Basically just a vent and my thoughts on the whole dating thing.

If you want to get ripped, you go to the gym. If you want to read books you go to the library. If you want swim you go to the pool etc etc.

I can't think of anything like that if you want to find someone to spend your life with. It seems to be only luck and coincidence and waiting for it to happen, and I find that incredibly frustrating.

Then people say to me that there's more to life than finding someone to love and that I should enjoy life even when I'm alone. That is the most hurtful comment I can think of. Must be so terrible to have someone in your life.
