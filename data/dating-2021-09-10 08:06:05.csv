0,plkr47,1631279456,Reality VS Emotions (It Sucks) HELP,"Trying to keep a long story short. There is an instructor at the gym I go to whom I think is quite cute and has a great personality. It took me months to work up the courage, but I finally asked her out. She said yes at first, but hesitatingly, so I told her no pressure, just be honest. She back peddled and said no, but only because she doesn't date people in her workout classes due to a fairly recent past bad experience she had with doing that. So, I said how about letting me take you out for a social drink instead. She said yes to this.

Fast forward a week and a half and we just had that social drink. My hope was that she would see what a great guy I was and perhaps change her rule on dating guys from her class. The conversation seemed fine, we both had some good laughs, and nothing was really awkward. However, I noticed she did not really dress up to the occasion (which was one sign I was using to try and read non-verbal interest cues). She had limited, maybe no makeup, sandals, t-shirt, hair up in a bun etc. She only had one drink which was another cue I noticed and she seemed distracted and anxious to get going by the end (maybe my negative mind reading into it, she said she wasn't when I asked I she needed to go). She also made several comments that she just wasn't looking to date at this time and that she felt sticking to her no guys from class rule was important (I guess this is the sign right?). 

I am divorced for about a year and this is the first time I have actually felt this in to someone, probably more that I should be at this point, and I'm not really sure why. Not wanting to give up on my hope, at the end of our time together I asked her if she'd be interested in doing a social drink again or a hike or whatever (really open-ended). She said yes, but I've convinced myself it wasn't a wholehearted yes (maybe without any evident to do so). I'm probably in full denial based on what I've said above, but I just cant get my emotions to accept what reality appears to be and it's really bringing me down. 

Objectively, this is probably never going to go anywhere, but subjectively I feel like I'm into her and want to try more. There are legit stories where perseverance has paid off in the dating world. I guess if I knew if she just wasn't into me definitively (maybe my looks, the fact I have kids, whatever) it would make it easier than ""she has a no dating students"" policy (or is this her polite way of telling me she's not into me?!)

My question is this: do I give up and feel like shit for awhile, or do I struggle through emotionally and stay in contact to see if there really is any interest on her end in another social get together (whatever that may turnout to be and in the long run to see if that turns into anything). If I don't just give up, how long should I wait to make contact and what should I say? Would love to hear from both M and F with perspectives. I promise I'm not crazy, but we've all been there when emotions try and win over what reality seems to be :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/plkr47/reality_vs_emotions_it_sucks_help/

5,pllhwk,1631282025,Am i overthinking this?,"I (F24) met this guy(26) 3 weeks ago on a dating app. We  hit it off immediately and he made it clear that he’s looking for a long term relationship. 

It was nice to hear so we agreed to take things slowly so we don’t rush and burn out too early. After week 2 of talking and FaceTiming, he drove 2 hours to come see me. The date went welll, it was very relaxed and easy going. Nothing physical happened. 

He wanted to come back the next week but i had other plans so we’re hoping to see each other the weekend after. 

My problem is this…he doesn’t text me unless it’s to ask to FaceTime every other day. Should we not have more consistent communication by now or am I overthinking things?

Last night (Thursday), I initiated a video call but then told him he could call me back when he’s done. (he just came back from the gym and wanted to shower and get settled). I knew i wouldnt be available until Sunday for another call so that’s why I wanted to talk to him before my long weekend. He knew about that too so it rubbed me the wrong way. 

He never called me back or texted that he wouldn’t be able to call back. I would have been fine if he communicated that but now I’m on alert for any other red flags.

I need some advice concerning someone I’m trying to get over. So just a little background, I have liked her for almost a year now and finally got the boldness to ask her out to lunch on my birthday. Her initial reaction was great and we had a date set but the very next day, she said the beginning of the semester (She’s in her final semester of college) was busy for her so she’d let me know when she was free.

I replied in an understanding manner and let it be. After that, I began to consistently text her to check up on her and she’d often take hours to reply or not reply at all. She doesn’t respond or return my calls either. However, she would still watch my stories on social media and act like everything was fine when I saw her at church on Sundays. I have been trying to give her the benefit of doubt but now it’s clear as day that she isn’t interested. 

Therefore, I have decided to move on but seeing as we see each other weekly, I am unsure of how to get over her. We’ve been friends for a while and are not strangers to each other. We serve in many organizations together. I would greatly appreciate any and all advice. Thank you so much!

Hello, I've been wanting to talk to someone for quite a bit now but all the dating apps I've gone through always lead me to the same boring people. What I mean by boring is that I'm doing all the talking. I'm a bit special In the sense that I have autism / more specifically Asperger's, I only found out recently... So let's just say that visually, people can't tell the difference between me and a normal person. So to take it easy I think I would like to start by meeting before from other countries. I'm a decent-looking guy but for some reason, the only girls who seem to be attracted in me just simply have IQs of 5 year olds no offense to them but I'm looking for more sophisticated relationships.

9,pllz96,1631283551,Are there many masculine people that are attracted most to their partner?,"I hope this doesn't break rules by generalizing. 

In my experience, every man I have dated has still been sexually interested in other women, and made it obvious to me. This made me feel unsafe in my relationships!

Is this universal, or do some men maintain the most attraction for their partner? 

To be clear: I understand that attraction can't be helped, but steering my mind back to my partner has always been my solution, seeing them as my number 1, etc. But I feel like my partners entertained these thoughts more, and some may have even acted on them. 

It was hurtful, so as I get back into dating I'm just wondering if this experience is the standard? Or do some masculine people actually dedicate their romantic affection to one person?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pllz96/are_there_many_masculine_people_that_are/
10,plm200,1631283796,I asked a guy out who just lost his job and now he’s ignoring me,"I asked this guy out a week after he lost his job and was forced to move in with his family. We were neighbors and I’ve liked him for a long time, but I’m shy and felt like it’d be too weird to pursue anything. So after he moved out, I finally texted him asking if he’d like to get coffee or something sometime. I figured that it’d at least lift his spirits. He left me on delivered overnight and then left me on read the following evening. It’s been a little over a week and I still haven’t heard from him. 

I can completely understand why he wouldn’t feel like dating right now, but I guess I was hoping he’d appreciate that I was still interested in him and he’d be open to talking to me, at least. I know it shouldn’t, but it’s really messed with my head and hurt my self esteem. 

I really thought he liked me and even though I’m shy and quiet, I’ve always felt like I’m fairly attractive. Now I’m questioning everything and I feel like anytime I thought a guy was attracted to me, I was just being delusional. 

I feel like if I was actually attractive, he wouldn’t risk missing an opportunity to be with me, no matter how badly he might feel about himself. I mean, he knows I like him enough not to care - I still asked him out.

13,plmifq,1631285246,Incels are not wrong about dating,Incels are right about how women work. You just can’t see it cause you were lucky enough to have good genes and you were able to find women who like you. For the rest of us we know how cruel and shallow women all are and we have experienced it. Women are much more vain and picky than men. Their expectations for physical standards are beyond belief. They won’t date a man who is not tall and muscular. If you’re short might as well give up cause no women will date you know matter how great your personality is. Women don’t actually care about personality. It’s more of a pretend thing they do to seem less shallow and stupid. Women behave the same and we know this. I don’t need to have interacted with women to know how they view the world and ugly short men. God forbid they talk to someone who doesn’t have abs. They really are just mean “people”. They will gladly date an abuser as long as he is hot. Women are just not good people. I wish they were but they are clearly insane and I see that now. They hate all men who don’t meet the beauty standard. Or at least view them as undateable.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/plmifq/incels_are_not_wrong_about_dating/
14,plmowk,1631285830,What to Do??,"In my previous relationship I (21M) was unfaithful to my partner. We were together for 4 years and I think it stemmed from feeling pressured into a relationship that I didn’t entirely want to be in, but that’s not what this is about. I’ve moved on, grown up, and I understand how my actions affected her. 

I recently began talking to a girl and things were going really well. We had already planned multiple dates for different situations in the future and I was incredibly happy. I decided I needed to tell her about my last relationship because I didn’t want to hide anything from her and hurt her and potentially ruin what we had. After I told her she was taken aback but respected my honesty and said we should take some time to both consider what it is we’re actually looking for, and I agreed, because I respect her feelings and don’t want to rush her into anything she isn’t ready for. 

A few days pass and we talk briefly and she, basically, wanted to thank me for being so understanding with her and for being honest about the situation. She had also said she would “definitely reach out” and she “thinks we could get a fresh start once we’re ready”. 

I’ve been incredibly stressed because I don’t want her to just say that as a way to reassure me when in reality she has no intention of actually talking to me again or something, but also I don’t want to feel like I’m pressuring her into a relationship. I feel like the right girl is worth waiting for and, with the way things were going, I definitely felt like she was the right one. I feel like we’re not doing ourselves any favors in not speaking to each other about what our thoughts and feelings are on the situation, but I don’t want to force her to talk about it or seem absolutely insane. 

Should I just give her time to consider things herself? Do I text her and ask if we can talk about it together instead(even though a few days have passed since our previous conversation)?

21,plnjgr,1631288487,"I'm 18F, and consistently only attracted to men older than me.. like, substantially old. Should I be concerned?","I've pretty much always been attracted to older men, but as I've gotten older, so have they. 40-50 seems to be the general age, but they can sometimes be older or younger. 

I'm aiming to explore it through a more controlled setting such as online NSFW chatting, and I have *zero* intention of meeting up or starting a real intimate relationship with anyone significantly older until *minimum* mid-20s.

For clarification, I don't mean the suave, 'silver-fox' George Clooney types; I mean the (and no offence here) slightly overweight, cynical but intellectual and self-assured / confident types. 

Honestly, think individuals spanning PSH's role in the movie 'Charlie Wilson's War' to the cop Jim Hopper from 'Stranger Things', even to 1990s Quentin Tarantino.. and I don't know why?

I've considered possible 'daddy' / paternal issues, and I don't have an unusual or traumatic relationship with him - if anything, my relationship with my mother is the main source of my childhood issues, so that can't be a factor for me.

To add to this, I'm also disinterested in getting married at all, or having any kids (I'll stay the cool aunt, thank you!). I'm not looking to be dependent on another person if possible, and actively enjoy and pursue aims to remain independent and 'solo' wherever possible (if that's a relevant factor?).

I've tried to be attracted to younger individuals, but for whatever reason I find it substantially more difficult to be attracted to them. I'm not too concerned (as my profile intimates) - but I just thought I'd let it out. I hope this isn't too strange. :/

After a week or so of that we make plans to go on a date, and then she asks me to send her money for gas on cash app to get to the date. I found this odd because usually when I have been messaged by scammers on dating apps they ask for money within the first day or two at most. ""I need money I'm stuck in xxxx and can't get home"" etc. I work for a cybersec/antifraud company and we actually work with several dating apps so I'm familiar with the many scams on these apps. And scammers usually always ask for money very early on in the convo because it's a volume game: most people won't respond to their request for money so they have to phish as many people as possible in order to get the small percentage who will fall for it.

But I've never seen anything like this before, I even mentioned to this girl it sounded like she was scamming and she sent me a picture of her ID for some reason. And we're still chatting back and forth even after I mentioned this, because I am genuinely curious as to what's going on. I'm using a google voice number to text so she doesn't have my real #.

I was talking to this guy all day everyday for a little over a month and last weekend he was texting me drunk and saying really sweet things to me that he doesn’t usually say. A couple days later, I decided to ask if he really meant those things. And with the help of my friends, they all said drunk people usually tell the truth and that it seems like he likes me so I thought the answer to the question would be “yes, I meant those things”. Boy, was I wrong. He said he didn’t remember what he said (he told me he did remember that night the day before) and said he doesn’t have time to date right now due to work and starting school again. 

I am devastated. We never even met in person but I felt like we had good chemistry. I’m trying to move on but talking to other people feels so wrong. He asked me if I want to continue to talk and be friends and even though it’s wrong and I should’ve said no, I said yes but that I was still hurt so give me some time. It’s been 4 days and no contact from either one of us. I cant bring myself to make the first move. I don’t know what to say! I think he does like me but pointing out him being vulnerable scared him a lot which is probably a red flag I know but I really need some help. I need to know what I am supposed to say to him after 4 days of no contact.

So One week ago i (24M) asked this girl (21f) if She wanted to go out friday and got no answer. A few days later She Said sorry for not replying but someone had been Faster than me. So i Said, cool, then lets meet Next friday. She asked what i had in mind, i told her about a rooftop bar i wanted to go to. She replied ""you thought of a place already! Impressive"". Througout the week we talk on WhatsApp a bit, She sometimes disapears for a day and then replies or i send her another message and She apologizes. Shes not doing anything right now because university hasnt started, mind you.

And this brings us to today. I texted her this morning saying something along the lines of ""are you ready for today?"" And i happened to see She was online at that moment. No reply. Fine. The day went on and no reply. It is now almost 19h and the date is at 21. No reply and i Saw She had just been online, so i sent a question mark, perhaps She didnt noticed the message in a bunch of other ones. Thing is, still no reply.

36,plozjq,1631293007,I played a conversation card game with a date; Now we are a bit distant; has anyone experienced this?,"Hi everyone, so I had an interesting experience that I thought I would share; so I met this man on Tinder in July, and we had our first meeting in August, and it was simply a 2-hour brunch where we spoke. 

Everything was good, and we had good ""chemistry, I would say.

So subsequent dates were at his house where we watched a movie/kissed, and overall we had good physical chemistry, with no sex, so overall, I was pretty happy to have met my match.

&amp;#x200B;

About two weeks ago, we had a wine/card game night where we played a game I had bought on amazon named CONVO and CHILL, so it is a conversation card game with various topics that helps you get to know your partner/friends better. 

We played the game for approximately 2 hours, and it ranged from questions regarding gender roles to love/marriage and so forth.

&amp;#x200B;

As we played, I have to say I discovered so many things about him that were red flags, such as his views on gender roles and so forth.

With that been said, This card game lowered our overall chemistry as I realized how different we were when it came to fundamental topics and that it would undoubtedly be a battle of compromise and so forth if we were to be together.

&amp;#x200B;

I think he realized this as well as he had told me that if this did not work between us, he would love us to stay friends as we have a fantastic flow between us and can speak to hours non-stop in person/via facetime.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, im 24; he is 30, so I have never had a boyfriend but have been on a few dates over the years, so this is my first time utilizing a conversation game card to know a date better.

 It was very much efficient for us figuring out if we were compatible relatively earlier on, but I was also surprised at how this game helped me to truly dig out some things I would not have thought of asking on a 5th date.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ll appreciate any comment/help. Sorry for the lost message","I think it’s time to talk about it, and this seems like the best place. I’m a just turned 19yo male who was very quiet in beginning of hs (9th,10th) . Around that time, I talked to a couple girls from my school but never really talked to them in person because I was shy and just weird honestly . I always talked to them on Ig or Snapchat, but never really in person. Looking back at it, I feel like slapping myself. A couple of girls did like me, and did want to form friends but I was to shy and too stupid, and missed plenty opportunities. The girls I liked I never made a proper move, or I’ll just never get a chance, never opened their messages or just left me on seen. In my old hs days, I guess I wasn’t as “cool” or “acted hard” as the other kids around me, and me growing up in a small ghetto town around Philly I grew up all around different cultures and how kids around me were raised a little different from me, and I guess girls liked kids with that lifestyle compared to a more quiet kid in my city. 

I always been a good looking dude, curly hair, lean body, nice eyes dress good stuff ppl would say is attractive etc. I’ve had girls and guys compliment Me for my looks especially since 11th grade, but we’ll get into that soon. In 11th grade is where I really stepped my game up, talked to girls way more in person, ask them out, became more confident and just grew as a person, I always was a nice and funny person , so my personality grew too. I was at a new high school, so I had more ppl to meet too. But the same problem kept on going. There was many girls that I liked and thought were cute, but never batted me an eye. I slide in their dms, tried to contact them but kept taking Ls. I had girls who I did succeed in forming a relationship with or just talking to them, i had a gf for 3 months, but still couldn’t “pull” as many girls as people think I pull and just in general I got rejected a lot . 

I started wondering, what was wrong with me? How come most of the girls I want to attract and fw, ignore me? I was decently popular, good style, good looks, nice and wasn’t in drama. Am I actually ugly? I believed so many things, I compared myself to my brother when he was my age and he was WAY better with girls, and he even says I look better then he did and etc. was it my game? How could it be my game, 50% of the girls I tried to get in contact with in social media never even opened my first message OR follow me back.


Fast forward senior year, I started to work in my game, my social skills , I grew taller, grew a beard, became more confident but even worse luck. Lots of men have the ability to attract girls, but I guess I just couldn’t , I always had to make the move and by then, I was getting rejected left on read etc. Was it the lack of actually confronting girls in person? Does just dming girls not working for me? Would my charm actually work if I go up to a girl at the mall? Nothing ever matched up, fast forward to now I haven’t had a gf, I been through 3 talking stages but in general I still take so many Ls, the girls I wanna match with in tinder don’t match with me, I get left on sent when I dm a new girl 70% of time and when I do succeed with a girl whether it’s if I met them online or in person, it never works or they ghost me. I’m tired of trying to figure out what’s wrong with me, and feel like I’m a loser. I was raised near boys who were bagging chicks way more then me and if I don’t or if I take all these L’s I’m a loser. I guess now I just continue to only focus on getting money, working out and being alone. What if I am just a ugly person? There’s something wrong wit me and I can’t find it. Maybe the mild bullying in middle school affected me in someway. Being really positive doesn’t work, I try to convince myself I’m a good looking dude and that I do attract women but the results don’t show . Maybe the $ will save me. I do really try.

60,plrsgb,1631301817,Another Dating Success Story,"I am a 46F. My boyfriend is 45M. My marriage ended in May 2018 because of his severe chronic alcoholism. Exh moved an hour away shortly after he moved out.

I did not date anyone or do any dating for a year after that because i knew i had nothing to offer. I had to heal. So i stayed single and worked on getting divorced.

After my one year was up in May 2019, i started online dating for the first time in my life. What an eye opener. I'd rate the whole experience about 6/10. The only benefit to OLD is access. I am a busy professional in a rural area. So yeah.

I went on about 10 dates with 10 different people. Of hat 10, i dated one for 6 weeks, another for 3 weeks, and then one for 4 months. One ended up annoying me and was too intense, one wasn't over his ex, and the 4 month one, he simply didn't have the time for a relationship and I ended it because 1) he wouldn't and 2) i didn't care about him because of the lack of time investment.

So a year of online dating was up in May 2020. I reflected and decided that it was more toxic than healthy and adjusted accordingly. I got rid of all my profiles and started using ONLY Zoosk at the suggestion of colleague. It's not free so people have skin in the game, and it skews older. I got far less matches, but the ones i got were decent. And the platform requires you to answer questions, etc. 

so in May 2020, my only profile was on zoosk. The summer of 2020 i became disillusioned with it all and by September i was ready to delete that profile and cancel. The reason was that i created a fake profile to see how people lied about their intentions. And gosh, do people lie about their intentions. The abyss looked back at me.

During this time, a few people had messaged me. I did not reply because i was DONE with it after looking into the abyss. One night i was in bed, and this voice popped into my head. It said ""You aren't being fair"". So i logged back in and looked at the messages 2 men sent me. They were decent messages and they had clearly looked at my profile. I messaged both back. After talking to J for about a week, he took me out to nice restaurant and had a great time.

That was a year ago come October 1,and we have been happily together ever since.

The lesson i learned is that you and them, have to want the SAME thing, at the SAME time and WITH each other. Wow, talk about the star having to align. but that is exactly what has to happen.

Also, there are a lot of bad actors and people acting in bad faith- saying they want a relationship, but don't really.

We agreed to take things really slow as I’ve never done anything like this at all and he hasn’t dated since he was cheated on in a very serious relationship (2ish years ago). 
 
The issue is we seem to have hit a “brick wall”. He told me today that he is ‘broken’ and that he is confused and if he isn’t happy in himself he can’t make anyone else happy. 
I completely understand where he is coming from and I want to support him through this in any way that I can. However the anger that I’m now feeling towards his ex and what she’s made him feel is killing me. 

I just want some advice on what I can do to be there for him but also just an outside opinion on the whole situation. I’ve never been in a relationship or even just the ‘talking’ stage so I’m completely in over my head.

73,plsjl4,1631304227,I (29m) haven't dated in 6 years or so because I have been healing from trauma. How should I answer questions about how long it's been since I've dated?,"I had some trauma from my childhood, and I had a traumatic experience in my early 20s and then a bad break up. after that I had a few flings and then decided to take a break and to just work on myself. I've also had my 2 sisters die in the last 5 years, and now I am an only child. 

I also don't talk to my parents because they are partly responsible for my trauma, the trauma my sisters dealt with, and they are too immature to take any responsibility or acknowledge any of their childrens' realities (""hey mom this traumatic thing happened right in front of you and its why me and my sister are so mentally unstable' - 'no that didn't happen and you are a liar')...

I've done a lot of therapy (literally been in therapy of some sort for most of the last decade). I am also still in therapy. I feel pretty stable and emotionally mature now, and I love myself. I'm building a new,, stable family with my dog, and my house is where people's needs are met. I have money/my career settled,, I have interests and passions and I'm an interesting person, I also work out and am quite attractive...

and I've been trying to date most of 2021. (been on like 8 dates or something, with 7 girls). the only second date was with a young woman who has also been through trauma but was not ready to open up emotionally with me (or presumably anyone).

I am really worried that any woman who hears that I've been in trauma and therapy for it and single and working on myself for a while and not talking to my parents... just too many red flags. Like I worry my positives cannot overcome the damage that things out of my control caused.

I feel I can't really open myself up to women because I believe my true self (all the ""baggage"" if you will) is too much for them to handle. that I am permanently a broken human being...

I am not looking for a woman to take care of me, I can do that myself... I just expect them to walk away because... well because I've had friends stop talking to me after opening up to them. 

Anyways. advice on how to talk about this with women?  Is some of my thinking here wrong? is there things I need to still deal with that are visible to you?

75,plssyi,1631305070,Trying dating apps has made me realize how lucky I was to find my ex gf and has made it impossible to move on,"This is a long rant. And ranting is useless, but wondering if anyone else here can relate.

Had a mutual breakup under a year ago, I figured it was for the best, she did too. Learned a ton about myself and how to master my emotions, and how to be a better boyfriend. Was completely over it at first. After 6 months, decided I was interested in dating again and tried dating apps for the first time. I came into it convinced there are a ton of girls out there just as good or better than my ex. Now, after putting a lot of time and effort into these apps, I can’t help but realize how statistically rare my compatibility with my ex was, and it’s messing with me.


I’m very driven, take great care of my body, social (naturally extroverted), great career, have a lot of hobbies and usually do 2-3 hours of physical activity a day. I’m certainly not “hot”, but I’m average looking at least. My ex was just as driven, we really pushed each other to constantly be better athletically, professionally and learn new things together. We had the same views politically and shared a lot of hobbies. Both ate very healthy and liked teaching each other new things.
What was great, is I am in a male dominated career, and we were in the same profession. I liked dating someone who I could share my career with, and looking back, I was incredibly lucky, given the ratio.


Going on dating apps has made me realize I might never have this kind of compatibility ever again in my life, and it is really getting to me. It seems finding a woman I click with who shares my career is very rare as is, but throw in someone who has the same drive, love for health and athletics, and loves to grow and learn is pretty darn difficult. I had never done dating apps in my life because I had always really enjoyed being single, I find a lot of joy out of being with my friends. I think you shouldn’t be with someone that you’re merely content with. My “type” physically is actually a big nose, big forehead and plain looking, I’ve never been attracted to the california Instagram girl. My ex was exactly my type physically, instant attraction.

I came into OLD with a very optimistic view of the dating pool, and I now feel like I blew it with a one in a million type girl. Statistically, I’ll likely never find a girl in my career field ever again, and have be okay with keeping my vocational passion to myself for the rest of my love life. I’ve kept an open mind and have matched with people who I’m luke warm on but willing to give a shot. After going on 18+ first dates, it’s been disheartening to not have found any chemistry. 70% of the time: fun people, but little drive, different politics, they’re more religious than initially lead on, doesn’t like being active, no intellectual interests outside of politics or quiet/awkward (nothing wrong with that at all, some men love that, just not my type sexually). 30% of the time, I couldn’t find physical attraction

I know this post will rub some the wrong way, but I can’t be the only one here who wants a partner who pushes them to be better/smarter/healthier every day, and shares the same passions.

All of a sudden , I’m scared I’ll be that ex who can’t move on after way too long has passed by. I already am in fact. She is now dating someone new, that door is closed. I don’t even want to think of how great of a selection she must have had on these apps.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/plssyi/trying_dating_apps_has_made_me_realize_how_lucky/

I’m a 30 year old short Asian American working in healthcare. Sadly I am not a doctor or nurse, just a staff member that helps out in labs and research sometimes. 

I had sick parents for most of my life so I was never able to hang out a lot during my 20s. So I don’t have friends that I go out drink with etc. so I don’t really have anyone to introduce me to people either. 

 I’ve also never had a relationship though I guess I’ve been on a few dates. 

I was surprised at how little feedback I get from dating apps, and trying to hit of girls i real life… I just end up being cordial. I guess years of customer service has stuck onto me. 

Generally I like movies and video games, but I also enjoy working out and riding my motorcycles. I like coffee but I’ve noticed it may be to a ailing degree… 

My question is idk how to approach women now I’m in my 30s. I just feel like everyone knows what they want and have little patience for an amateur with my stats to come in. (And no I’m not blaming anyone, real talk idk if I would have the patience if I had more experience) I just need advice on how “strategize”",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pltffw/advice_on_how_to_approach/

81,pltsnr,1631308329,What do I do as I move into the the first stages of dating for the first time?,"I (M18) had been talking with this girl (F17) for a month or two and I decided last night (or better yet, very early this morning) to ask if she would be my girlfriend and she said yes. This was after a long night of talking and enjoying each other’s company. 

I have never dated a girl in earnest before and I’m kind of nervous on how to act. How should I engage with her differently now that we are “officially dating”? What type of physical relationship should I expect? 

My love languages are service and physical touch. I enjoy holding the door for her, or helping her with homework, or whatever she needs. I really care about her and I want to be able to show it. 

But as much as I desire to help her, I also at times want to embrace and hold her. Growing up that’s just how my family would show love and with my own friends growing up, we would often greet each other with fun handshakes or engage in some horseplay. It’s just how I learned to show love. 

We have both been clear that we fully intend on waiting until marriage, but aside from that, I don’t know what she wants and I don’t want to make her feel uncomfortable by asking her too straightforwardly. She might interpret it wrong and think that is the only reason I want to be with her.

So the date was Originally a walk n Ice cream.
It was meant to be like max n hour or two but its ended up like 5 hrs ;)
The time just flew like hell.After Ice cream n Slush she mentioned a place nearby so we just walked up there n had some cocktails eventually missed our trains so we had to wait a bit longer so we went for a wee walk around.Meanwhile we were waiting she kissed me out of blue....it was like heaven...I have not got kissed for yrs n yrs.Then she did  it again n we hold a bit of hand before we depart.But when she went thru the game she waved n said our bye n headed for her train.Never looked back.
So question....am I been tested to how im good in kissing n failed or its just the first date but she really wanted it.
When to text after the first date?
Im all new to dating at age 33 so its something sounds childish all these questions but im even more lost than before.

97,plvp28,1631314810,I'm scared.,"Ok this might not be a big deal but it's scary for me, would appreciate anyone who's had similar experiences to reassure me..
Matched with a guy on tinder a few weeks back, he seemed alright and asked for my WhatsApp, should've known this was a bad idea (I've learned my lesson now too late). He wanted some pictures of me so I sent them ... Eventually found out how much of a creep he is by stalking his social media (all his posts were of him basically praising himself for being such a good human/nice person wtf), so I decided to cancel the date nicely. I made it very clear I'm not interested in a relationship anymore and wished him well. He seemed compliant but then would send texts like ""I understand, I have no luck with girls because I'm such a nice guy etc .. sorry I won't bother you again etc.."" thought it would stop but then he still occasionally texts me. I'm actually a bit freaked out now cause it just feels like he might take his anger out on me somehow, he lives quite close I think and he has my photos and number. I don't know what to do or if I'm over reacting but his behaviour on social media and the way he talks just gives me the impression he isn't stable. 

Has anyone been in this situation before and what did you do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/plvp28/im_scared/
