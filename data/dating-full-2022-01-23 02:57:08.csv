This obese, Mexican lady, in her 50s some times tries to hit on me at work. She often times complements me and tells me that I look nice . She touched me twice. One time she told me ""you're invited to the party"" and touched my arm while giggling. Another time, she she said ""glad you made it"" and touched my leg. One time she made a joke about my pants fitting me nicely. Another time she made a joke about me getting married. She touches her hair often when interacting with me and has that ""flirty"" way of talking with me. (kind of like how girls in their teens and 20s talk to guys they like)  


Her husband recently died. I am 26, not overweight or obese, and she in her 50s and obese.  


It kind of makes me wonder tho. does she actually think that I will sleeo and date her or is she just joking(like a grandma calling her grandson handsome, or a teacher complementing a young student? )  


Maybe she's on too many online dating apps where she gets 100+ matches a day and watches too much fantasy porn , and does not understand the difference between that and real life. She could also be messing with omegle and other sex apps where females get a trillion billion times advantage over men.

I started casually dating a few girls starting winter 2021. But come November I started seeing someone I've become quite fond of. We've had numerous dates and slept together. All the signs &amp; signals have been positive, and she seems keen and interested. I've been cautious not to rush back into anything, but I guess sometimes you just can't help what the universe throws at you. 

But I've come to a roadblock in this 'purgatory' stage of talking/seeing each other. She's the first person where ideally I'd like to become exclusive with her, but maybe not become totally official or put any labels on anything quite yet. Just a mutually respected agreement of exclusivity. I wouldn't be put off if it turned out she wanted to get serious long term. 

So when's the right time to somehow ask? I don't want to rush and potentially scare her away too soon, but also don't want to take too long and make her think I'm taking her for a ride. Is there even a right time?

But im also a bit scared that i might be liying to myself about my feelings. We met the 4th of january, we got into a relationship the 10th. So we skipped the whole dating period, and we've been together the entire time since.

Reason is bcs we met in a psychiatric hospital, she was in for suicidal thoughts and i was in for panic attacks. I was already in there for a couple of days before she came in. She pretty much never left my side, fell asleep in the chair next to me (not allowed to sit close) wearing my sweater and jackets, which i found incredibly cute. A friend new she had feelings for me (she didnt know that i knew) and told me, the next two days i kinda teased her a bit. Bcs 1: i needed time to grasp the fact that a girl wanted me (never had that happen before) so it was kind of a strange feeling to me 2: i like teasing people in general and 3: a hospital isnt the most romantic place in the world. So ever since the 4th we were pretty much the entire time together, we are home now and we are basicly living together.

But now the struggle issue in my head. Bcs we were/are together all the time ever since we met, i havent had time to process what i feel exactly, and i fear that i went into a relationship with her because it was the easiest way to have someone by my side at all times and not be so lonley anymore. I havent had that tension with her (getting a good morning text or waiting till she finally responds,...). Dont get me wrong she is super cute and sweet and will do anything for me and i for her, i love spending time with her. She's super understanding, she is more experienced than me, i was a complete virgin (never even hugged a girl my age), and she agreed to follow my tempo. Turns out my tempo wasnt that slow. The first hug lead very quickly to the first kiss that lead to the first time frenching and so on. It all moved so fast bcs i feel really comfortabel with her, i never felt weird arround her, like ive been with her for years. But since this is my first relationship im still trying to figure out if this is a good feeling, like in love feeling or if its a fwb feeling, schouldnt the first time everything feel embarrasing? Or a tad bit unnatural? The first kiss felt like i was doing it for years. 

I cant really think about not having her here with me without getting a bit blue. But is it like wanting a friend arround or being in love? Im probably overthinking this way to hard but i dont want to lead her on if i dont feel the way she does. I have ADD and possible Autisme, so i never truly am in touch with my feelings, which can be anoying in analysing what i actually feel. 

One last thing, she thought she was pregnant, so we went to a GP to do a bloodtest. When she first mentioned it i got scared and stressed a ton, but two days past (waiting on the result), and i loosend up to the idea and wasnt opposed to raising a child with her. But the news came and the result was negatif, i felt relieved but sad at the same time. Which made me realize that if i ever have kids i would love to have them with her. But the question again: is it bcs i love her or bcs she is available.

One thing she loves to do is try and (french)kiss me in public spaces, lay her leg on mine (busses and stuff), touch my private area (to annoy me). I am a pretty shy person and also this is all very new to me, with holding hands and kisses i feel fine, but kissing for long periods of time or being to close as if we are at home make me feel a bit unneasy. So again is it bcs i might be lying to myself about my feelings that i dont want to be too touchy, isnt that what people that are in love do? I see other couples do it all the time, but i just dont want to, and i dont have a reffrence point to compare my feelings with, would this be me in all relationships or just not with her? Or will this change once im more used to it? 

I know im overthinking this, and that i should let it happen naturally, and just let my feelings do their thing. But im stressing about it all, i dont want to hurt her or lose her. So if anyone has a simular story or any advice or tips or questions please share them.

Have a great day everyone!

It's always a casual short hug that each of us go in for and expect.

Recently, I was on a first date with a 31F. You'd think a 31 year old woman would know the routine, or you know, be adult-like. We met online and decided to go out to a restaurant downtown. She's waiting outside and I walk up and we greet each other. I go in for the casual first date hug and she hesitantly hugs back and was like ""oh wow, you're a hugger."" I jokingly said ""haha you ever bin on a first date before?"" We have that awkward laugh and then we proceed to be seated. Instantly the conversation begins by her assuming I'm some fucboy and have ulterior motives. ""So how many dates have you been on in the last month? Are you sure you're looking for a relationship?? Do you hug all your dates? Do you invite all your dates over to your place for the first date?"" Then she said ""sorry maybe I don't know how this online dating thing works."" I again jokingly said, ""maybe this is why you're 31 and still single."" The date definitely could've ended right there but it didn't.

Things have been sort of ""off"" since this past November.

Tonight, I ended up having to stay at a relative's house a mile down from his place due to his mom showing up unannounced and inviting herself to sleep over. He felt really bad and apologized multiple times, saying I can stay an extra day to make up for it, which then lead to him saying we should cuddle for a bit, promptly leading to foreplay and sex before he dropped me off here.

I'm not really sure what to think. I have a feeling we'll just keep doing what we've been doing. His mood can fluctuate significantly due to him being diagnosed with/taking meds for severe depression, anxiety and ADHD.

We have a bit of a thing, but never took it seriously or progressed it until last year.

We’ve slowly worked up where we were going to make it sexual, which brings me to now:

The weekend before we agreed to hang out this weekend and sleep together. So during the week I made my plans to “do it right”.

I planned a meal with premium ingredients, and a 3 day prep. Found out her favourite drinks, and dessert.

Her son in law also works at the same company as us, and always asks her to babysit on Friday and Saturday nights; So I approached him and gave him $100 for a babysitter and/or other inconveniences (take note of this).

In the meantime I wanted to make a good impression as I’m a hairy mofo from taking testosterone for a deficiency, so decided to trim up a little.

While shaving I noticed a tiny skin tag on my leg and being self conscious thought “Uh-oh. This doesn’t look too good. She might get the wrong idea that it isn’t a skin tag”, so decided to cut it off.
First came the nail clippers, but it too spongy for them.
Next came the nail scissors, but they were too blunt.
Floss was next on the list, but I was out. Then it to me…. I’ll just flick it off with the razor!

So I threaded the skin tag through the razor held it in the fingers of one had and yanked the razor the razor down with the other hand to make it quick.
It was quick all right, but it also tore down my leg like a hangnail which left a long red line which soon started to pour out with blood.
Due to my lack of planning and medical supplies I ended up treating it with vodka  I brought for our date night and swabs.

Then for the actual date….
I asked if she would would like to come around Friday night.

The answer was no, she’s watching her grandkid. Ho-hum. Maybe it was her other grandkid, not the one from above? No worries, that’s out of my control.

“What about Saturday then?”
“No sorry. Since I don’t have any grandkids I’m going to the city clubbing”
- Going to the city clubbing here generally means to go to clubs looking to get laid.

I really need advice on this as I seriously have nowhere to turn.

I started speaking to this man (44) last year on the basis of a Dom and Sub relationship (it was mainly based on that and I did not plan on it becoming emotional). As time went on, I fell for him as we would chat daily on Telegram. The moment he said ""can we turn this into a relationship"" I instantly said yes and as much as we still mainly discussed our fantasies around sex and positions within our roles as Dom and Sub, I still had these feelings to discuss more. By the way, this is a long-distance situation as we are not in the same city. As I started asking him questions that required vulnerability, he would close up, take a really long time to reply (sometimes days), I would mention that and he would either say that he's ""going through a lot"" or that he's busy as he owns his own business.

One thing that he highlighted early on is that he is non-monogamous sexually, and I will be honest, even though I agreed to it as I know some people are able to separate sex from love, it did give me some discomfort as I was far away from him and still am, and our situation is not solid so for all I know I am a placeholder for someone he really wants.

&amp;#x200B;

He went silent for four months after agreeing to see me when I was in his city and now he has recently reconnected, the feelings have flooded back. We recently had a conversation about the future and how he wants kids with me, asked me for the ring size and stone that I wanted, but he hasn't wh even confirmed when he will fly me down to his city as he had promised me before he went silent. He said he went silent because he had a stroke and was comatose for 3 months, which I am having doubts about at the back of my mind. He just expressed a fantasy that he would like me to be a part of which is a foursome, which I had slight objections to mainly because I find that he is quickly able to discuss things like fantasies but when it comes to solidifying our bond and sexual compatibility in person first he goes silent. Maybe I am being insecure but I believe that before he ventures out into an open relationship, I would at least like to establish a strong connection with him first and know where I stand. He says that he is in love with me but has not shown that and part of me thinks he's taking advantage of my feelings for him to gain my trust and later use me.

It consisted of a daily good morning text followed by a couple of other text threads throughout the day. No dates or phone calls. There were some more provocative messages some of which I played into. I had the sense that this person may be a bit stuck on a previous partner or not over a break up because of a couple of songs he said he was listening to. He was very friendly, and his photos gave off really warm energy and he seemed very kind. I thought after some of his texts, that he seemed like an angel. He did look like a hornier person, which admittedly is part of the reason why I liked his profile. At first, I thought, I’m not sure about him, I will go on a date when he asks me when he gets back from visiting his parents, but I’m not sure it will go well. I also was crying a bit though when he would text me the first or second week because I think, I wanted more from him, like a call. Sometime during week 3 or 4 of texting I heard the “here comes the bride” theme song in my head, which I was surprised by. He attempted to jokingly invite me over to his place at a later date. To this I said, I probably would feel best doing that after some dates and a conversation. He responded positively. It was awkward the next couple of text threads.The following day another more sexual comment was made too which I said, I do want more than a winter man or some thing casual. He said same here. During another conversation he said please let me know if these comments make you feel uncomfortable because I don’t want to do that and will stop making them if that’s the case. I said well, I do like knowing that you have interest in me that way. The following day, in the morning, I said that I was still in bed and he said why don’t I join you there and we both skip work like that idea. I did say that it sounded like a nice idea. That was pretty much the text exchange. I felt turned on in the moment, but very uncomfortable later in the day and tense and anxious and not great for a couple of days afterwards. The conversations that we had following that exchange were more brief and awkward. I was contemplating just sending him a text letting him know that I felt uncomfortable and that I wanted to not text in that way now. Then I could see how he responded and how I felt afterwards. My friend called and I talked to her, and she pushed me to break things off with him. The text was as follows “So, I’ve been feeling sort of anxious and tense over the past couple of days. I think it’s because I went along with some of the sexual comments, but we’ve not yet met or had a phone call, and I don’t expect I’m the only woman being texted. Basically, I’m at a point in my life where I want to be married, and I want to be dating someone who is a potential future spouse, and is viewing me as a potential future spouse. I don’t think that’s what’s been happening here. Basically, I would just like to call it on this texting thing. I’ve enjoyed talking to you though, and I wish you all the best.” To which he said “ok, I understand. Good luck:) and thanks for being upfront and letting me know”. Then I said “thanks :)”, and he said “:)”. It has been more painful than I anticipated not receiving his texts. More painful than some actual breakups that were in person. I feel now that I could have just gone with my original plan of telling him how I felt, and maybe also, that I wanted a call, which I probably could have done sooner, but didn’t want to push. I really miss talking to him and wish that I had not sent a text that was so final. Wondering if I can get some input on the situation from a broader range of folks. He does seem like someone I could be compatible with energetically and based on photos, I think there would be chemistry. A lot of people are not meeting up right now because the omicron numbers are so high, and he expressed he has not been going out.

I (F26) went out recently with this guy (M28) on a first date. We met on hinge, and had been texting for like 2 weeks.

I didn’t necessarily have anything sexual in mind, it just seemed like the right thing to say? One thing lead to another and we started making out. It was super late at this point so he asked to sleepover. We hooked up again in the morning after waking up, before both getting dressed and leaving for work. He said he would text. I felt good about it the first day after, it was fun and I haven’t slept with anyone in so long. But now, it’s been a full day and I’ve heard nothing.

I've never had a girlfriend, I've never been on a date, I've never gotten laid, I've never kissed or have been anywhere close to a woman before. In high school, whenever I'd develop a new crush, either she had a boyfriend, didn't reciprocate my feelings, or there were a million other guys after her and I'd always lose the battle to some other guy. In college, I tried going on Tinder and using other dating apps, but they were ultimately a waste of time. I wasted about 4 years on apps and didn't land a single date. Hardly any matches, I'd just get ignored and randomly ghosted. I'd go out to bars and try to talk to women but usually got shot down right away. My friends would always get all the girls without having to lift a finger and I'd be left on the sidelines. I tried talking to a few girls from my college classes about things like homework, school, professors, etc. but they seemed uncomfortable that I was talking to them, and I could tell they just wanted to get away from me. After I graduated I successfully met a few women, but I always ended up friendzoned right away while I got to hear all about the guys they were **actually** interested in. Recently, I was talking to a girl and everything was going well. She'd tell me that she always thought about me, that she cared deeply for me, and that I was always in her heart. When I opened up about my feelings...she told me that she had a boyfriend. She never mentioned him once. At that point I lost all hope in ever finding a girlfriend.

Every girl I talk to these days either isn't attracted to me, sees me as just a friend, has a boyfriend, has a million other guys after her, or all of the above. It's so demoralizing watching some guy get unlimited and unconditional love and sexual attention from girls when I've been struggling with that very thing my whole life. I'm not even a bad looking guy. Maybe my worst physical flaw is that my face isn't the most chiseled or masculine looking but I'm in good shape and I don't even consider myself ugly. I've had girls tell me that I'm attractive and some even used the word ""hot"". People tell me that I'm kind and understanding and have a good heart. I don't come out guns blazing telling girls that I want to fuck them right away or some kind of creepy shit, I just try to be normal and be myself, I try to genuinely get to know them. I'm not saying that this means I'm owed attention from women but I don't want people to assume that I'm just some creepy bastard who lacks all forms of social skills. I feel that there's some deeper reason as to why I'm just not getting any attention from women...but I don't know what it is.

I've pretty much surrendered and accepted that I'll never find a relationship for the remainder of my life. Everybody around me is getting married and having kids, I'm still here without having been on a single date. Soon everybody my age will be married and settled down, and then I'll be too old to date and it will all be over.

I'm tired of torturing myself with unreciprocated feelings and unrequited loves. I hate that I've been programmed to naturally desire a relationship but never being able to find one. I always wanted to get married and settle down with someone, but I'm ready to give up completely on that whole idea. It just seems like a fantasy, a pipe dream at this point.

Two weeks pass after we talk every day and I ask her out. She says yes we go out and the date went well. 2 weeks later I hang out with her and her friends and nothing pretty much happened between us. The next day, schools started and our free time got reduced as you can imagine.

We were still chatting quite regularly and we hang out again with her friends after a month. (I should mention that before we hang out I had asked her twice out and she had some excuses not to go). Anyway, after that hang out I realise that I might be friendzoned. I sent her a message the following week telling her to tell me when she is available to go out because I wanted to say something to her in person. After that message she kept initiating conversation but never told me to hang out and she also said that lately she doesn't have time for anything other than school. I should also mention that she told to a mutual friend of ours that I wanted to tell her something in person and that friend even asked me about it.

A month later we chat and I asked her about what she did today and she told me she hang out that day. I then text her this message: ""instead of: I don't have time for anything other than school you could have told me: I don't have time for you"". The conversation we had pretty much didn't lead anywhere and it was something like a misunderstanding though I managed with the use of humor to make the situation more chilled so it would be considered as a fight.

A few days later I wish her happy birthday and we had a small talk. A few more days go by and she wishes me merry Christmas again leading to a small talk. We didn't talk for more than a week after that and that's where I decided that I had to figure things out. I sent her a voice message where I told her that I was kinda confused about what our relationship is like and I wanted to make sure we are on the same page

We have quite a conversation there and the main point is that she told me that she didn't have energy or time for anything more that friendly. I told her that we should find a field where our wants are aligned and that just friends isn't in that field. She then told me: So, I have to do something that I don't want, or cut off with you?
I reply with: same goes for me. It was kinda late when we had this convo and she told me that she had to to to bed. I told her: ok gn but we have to sort this out later. She replied: I know. Two weeks have passed including by birthday and i haven't received a text. I was thinking of sending her as I thought about it and staying friends wasn't that bad of an option for me after all but I didn't want to be the one to reach out once again, as I would be seen as needy if I wasn't already perceived like that.

I wonder what I did wrong about this. There are also some random things to mention here. She has really strict parents, she is pansexual and on the first hangout she told me she was more attracted to girls, the mutual friend I mentioned above told me that when he asked her if I had a chance she said:""he is handsome, plays 5 musical instruments and 3 sports. What do you think ?"" Anyway that's all I have to say.

So yesterday we met again and we went to a teahouse where we spent more time together.We stayed there and talked for about 4 hours but unfortunately because of COVID restrictions the place had to close and we had to leave. We couldn't stay outside because it was too cold so we decided to go home.

We still talked afterwards when we arrived home and I told her that I had a really good time and I am really looking forward to see her again and she said that she also had a great time and can't wait too meet again.

So my question is, when we will have our next date  do you think is the right time to finally kiss her? I had the intention to even kiss her last time but I wasn't too close to her , by that I mean to sit right next to her. I also thought maybe it is to soon and I didn't want to be akward.

From my point of view, she (18F) is a emotional person, soft-hearted and very nice to other people. Sometimes, she makes me want to be the person that’s going to be there for her to lean on whenever she’s sad.

We work at a boba shop and have worked together for 5 months already (prob more since we will have the same shift again) and the interactions between both of us is just off as if we had a cold war against each other* and it just makes me hesitate to talk to her. However, when we actually talk to each other, it goes normal but mostly just very short convos.

*I don’t know if it is just how I think but the reason is that, during my training days, I messed up a lot when working with her and that might have caused bad impressions toward her.

I understand that it’s generally a no no to date a coworker, but I magically sense a bit of hope in winning her heart.

The problem for me is that she have met this other guy for like over a year that she says she don’t even like hon buy she still meets him. She said to me that they are just friends and it takes a while for her to make someone exclusive.
I have only met her for like a week and I don’t really know what I can expect.

For example when I am at a night club I was getting numbers here and there or when I was on the street approaching I a was getting some numbers but the girls always play games and at the end they aren’t really interested. They do it because of the attention and validation. What I have noticed at a night club if a girl really likes she will come to you start dancing with etc… Otherwise most of the time you will just get played. I had girls coming to me and those girls in fact were easy to date because they actually Liked me. If I approach at the club the chances are she will give you the number just so you can fuck off then dance and leave with the guy she actually likes then she will either never reply to you block you or just reply and always telling you maybe when you ask her out. Which basically means yea if I am really bored and the guys that I actually LIKE aren’t available I may go out with you. Does anyone agree? I have been out and about and that’s my experience. I am 21 btw. Share your thoughts and let me know what do you think.
