After dwelling on it I am realizing that maybe she wasn't an ideal partner all along.

Maybe its the little things that matter, I will give an example. 

One the last date I took her to a Christmas lights thing.  I was basically a historic property owned by the state adorned with christmas lights and installations everywhere.  To make it fun for the kids they had this dorky thing, a reindeers scavenger hunt where you had to find the reindeer ornaments and punch a hole in a pamphlet for the reindeer that you found (eg dasher, cupid, etc ). I was kind of enthused by it and wanted to play it too but she would not have any of it.  After snapping one and then finding another one she insisted it was not worth it because we had to wait for the kids in front of us.  So I gave up on the game for the rest of the walk and I did not want to make a deal out of it since it wasn't important for me.

So maybe she was the type of person that took herself too seriously and I am more of a jovial type. 

Other than that she has a busier schedule than me.  I like to travel a lot and go on adventures and wish that she would join me.  Because she is in an MBA program part time, she has to study during her time off work.  So it presented an existential crisis for me. Prior to her breaking up with me I was holding myself back from planning travels in 2022.  With her out of the picture now I am back to thinking of trips.

My ideal partner is someone who can keep up with my travels.  I fly every month to a new state and run half marathons or hike.  She is not as athletic as me, she wouldn't have run races and as far as hikes maybe we would have had to find easier ones she would be able to do. So I wouldn't have held that against her but there is other things within travel like going to museum and checking out restaurants that would have been activities we'd done together.

Let me know what other folks think, I secretly envy couples like these ones that created Youtube channels of all the travels that went to:

basically ca. 2 Months ago I started talking to a guy on tinder who I found very attractive even though he told me he is pretty short. My initial intent was to just sleep with him because i was just feeling like having some fun.
To know where he stood with this I asked him from the geico what he was searching for. He said: to feel the vibe and see where it goes from there.  

I gave him my number and so began our messaging. Initially i thought he was kind of boring to text - he seemed geniuinly interested and asked me questions about myself - so I always re-directed our conversations to something sexual by making flirty texts. 

Soon however I realized he was quite a witty texter and always had good flirty come backs that even made me go weak in the knees. Im not exggagerating - on the night right before the day we where about to meet up, we sexted each other and boy, did he make me want him bad. It just seemed like he knew what I wanted to hear, what my fetishes where etc… 

We live about 1 hour away from each other and the reason he was in town was because he was visiting his friend, hence why he suggested to meet at my place after. Sadly though, he never showed up. His excuse was that he smoked one too many joints and fell asleep at his friends house..

My reaction to this was a bit needy - I told him it sounded like an excuse and that he should just be honest if he was on another date or just didnt feel like meeting up. He responded almost annoyed asking why it was so hard to believe that he could have fallen asleep

After this I was really growing genuine interest because he fascinated me. I honestly told him that I felt a genuine interest in him and wouldnt just want to hoock up immedietly etc… His response being that if he wanted sex with someone he is already somewhat intetested in them..

After this his texts became allot less and I was growing frustrated. I confronted him and he then said he just wants fun..

Anyways I told him that was ok and that I wanted fun too.

We arranged to meet up again but this time he invited me to his home because his parents where out of town. However on the day we planned to meet my period started and I told him we had to reschedule. We began snapchatting and sending more pictures (no nudes) of each other and out desire to have sex grew even more. He made it obvious that he wanted me bad and I also wanted him as well.

The next weekend we tried again but I wasnt able to make it to his place because i got sick…He seemed just as frustrated as me that we still werent able to meet and make our fantasies reality.

After this his parents where back in town and now i asked him why he couldnt just meet me at my place..

His responded by practically ignoring my question. I dont get it at all..seems like he only wants to have sex with me if i go to his place..he doesnt seem motivated to come to my place.. 

buuut whyy? hes getting sex either way and if he is as in to me as he makes it seem..why the heck wouldnt he come to my place??

Can a man please explain what the heck this guys deal is? This has never happened to me..if i offer a guy the chance to come to my place for sex they never turn that down…

I need some advice on a particular situation and I would like to hear the perspective of another person. So here it goes. 

There is this girl that I really adore. We met each other on Instagram about two years ago on Instagram. I actually replied to one of her stories that she posted on her birthday and we hit it off really well. After a couple of weeks, we both exchanged phone numbers. We kept on growing closer by chatting on WhatsApp and I became somewhat like a very close friend to her, which I do not mind at all, although some may say that I was friend zoned or whatever. So, sometimes I give her advice and help her with her schoolwork since we are both of the same age and we have a lot of similarities. She has a really friendly and humble attitude which helps in understanding why she has a lot of friends. Recently (around July 2021), she started used love-related stickers while we spoke. I had no problem with this because my feelings for her was and still is genuine, so of course, I reciprocated the actions. She also sends me a lot of pictures and videos that I cherish because in my opinion, she really is a gem of a person. 

The problem is, as much as I love her and would like to date her, I do not want to. This reason for this is because, at this point in my life, we both have some examinations coming up that will determine some of our future opportunities. I do not want her to be distracted and I do not want myself to be distracted. Since we are quite young, both sixteen years old, and we have a long while to go in terms of education and life as a whole, I really want to be there to support her when it is that she faces some real challenges in her life. I feel as if a relationship right now, would jeopardize our future together. I would really like to date her as I said before but, I would like to in about ten years, when we both get our degrees and so forth. By jeopardizing our future, I mean that, if we were to have a relationship now, the probability that one of us slips up and makes a mistake is very high since we are teenagers and I know from past experiences that, once you date some one and separate from them, you never feel the same love and affection towards them again and you never really connect as much anymore. It is almost as if you lost the person as a whole. 

The question to all you lovely people is, what should I do and how should I go about doing it? Should I confront the situation and tell her as it is that I do not want a relationship until we both successful (I believe that this would be a good idea but I am not sure as to how I should tell her.) Also keep in mind that she and her family is of the upper-class population while my family and myself on the other hand is more of the middle-class population moving towards the upper-class, nevertheless, she has dreams and aspirations and we both would like to go into the medical field and I wish to give her emotional, affirmational and whatever other support that she may need. 

I know that this was a long read and I would just like to thank everyone would read it out and everyone would be willing enough to give their point of view and advice. Thank you very much and have a great weekend. 

TL;DR   
I really like a girl a lot but I do not want to date her right now but it seems as if she wants a relationship by the type of chats, we have a daily basis. I need advice on how I should tell her, that I do not want to date her to preserve our friendship, so that I would not lose her.

I feel like spontaneity is KEY when keeping the inquantifiable 'magic' or 'spark' alive. But of course timing is so subjective that some may say a week is too short notice ... and a some might even be willing to drop their preliminary evening plans on any particular morning if inclined to do so.

I ask this because I kinda just wanna drop the following text to a girl...

&gt;*Hey if you’re not busy this evening, you wanna grab some drinks? x* 

And I just wanna be reassured that 

1. It's gonna be more likely than not to get a positive response
2. I time it well so that I don't let the girl sit on it for too long to give her the chance to ghost, yet allow for.

Some may argue that asking someone to meet up that same morning is tooo short notice BUT realistically people aren't actually as busy as they make out - and surely if they WANTED to do something, they would do more to work around.

I COULD lead with 'Wanna meet up some time?' - But the 'some time' part of that phrase leads too much uncertainty of whether that will ever happen.

So with that said, I’m trying to change myself so that I can get at least ONE woman to find me at least somewhat attractive to the point where she’ll like me. I don’t have anyone in particular, just someone random really. I don’t know a whole lot of women except for the ones I met in high school, and most of them are doing their own thing with their own lives since you know, we all graduated. I only had one relationship in high school but that girl hates my fucking guts so, there’s no getting that back. As much as I tried, there’s nothing I can do. She was the only one I loved, and to this day there’s STILL unresolved issues between us, which contributes a little bit to this whole problem. I pretty much moved on, but the fact that there’s unresolved issues and questions left unanswered definitely fucks with my dating life a bit. But with that aside, what do I do to make myself more attractive? I’m willing to change everything about myself just so that I can have someone. I’m about 5’6, 5’7, somewhere around there. I know I can’t do anything about my height, but I do know that I’m not too small, but not too tall either. I’m like medium. Societal standards say that’s short, but I think of it as if I was a drink at McDonald’s or something, I’d be like a medium size lol. I’m also pretty skinny. I definitely don’t look like I eat enough but I do. Maybe I need more iron? Like iron vitamins or something? I at least play beat saber for cardio so it’s not like I don’t work out at all, ya know? Uhh let’s see I don’t really have a job, but that’s because I’m still trying to figure out my career path. I worked at hot topic once but couldn’t handle it due to my anxiety. I don’t have a car YET, but I am getting one in the near future as I’m just now learning to drive, so that one’s not really a problem. I don’t really have a religion but my best friend did give me some advice and I’m starting to consider converting to christianity. My clothes are a little bit weird considering it’s composed of mostly black (black skinny jeans, black cargos, black/red/pink hoodies). It’s definitely a weird mix of emo and punk for sure. So I’m wondering, should I get more flashy and bright clothes? Is black a turn off maybe? Or do women like that and I should instead keep my existing wardrobe? Next is my hair. I’m not gonna lie my hair’s looking rough right now lol. It was originally shaved in the back and on the sides, with it being long in the front. It was definitely on the more punk side, but since then it grew out and it’s looking more rough for sure. I originally wanted like a crazy cool hairstyle to stand out from the crowd, but then I’d literally just look like everybody else because everybody’s dyeing their hair and all that nowadays anyways. So instead, I was thinking about doing the opposite and just getting a normal haircut instead. My two closest friends have normal haircuts and they have girlfriends so it makes sense wouldn’t it?

So I have a little dilemma right now. Next week will be my last week of work with my current employer. Friday is my last day. I’m going to be moving on to a new job.

I have a coworker who is incredibly gorgeous. Really confident, charismatic, smart. I would really love the chance to get to know her more.

I usually wouldn’t consider asking out a coworker, but given that I’m leaving, I’m now seriously considering it.

She has mentioned in the office that she is currently dating. I think she may be seeing another guy. I don’t think they’re particularly serious however. They’ve maybe only had a few dates - definitely not gf/bf.

We get on really well in person. We follow each other on insta and she always watches my stories, she’s complimented me a couple of times. Obvs these aren’t huge signs of attraction though.

I’m wondering what the best way to approach this is. Has anyone here been in a similar situation? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

It was mostly long-distance, sometimes in the same city during summers, but overall it was pretty toxic, on-again-off-again, lots of bickering and fighting, and we even went many months without speaking to each other during that 6-year period. Those periods of silence were always initiated by me telling her I couldn't talk to her anymore or I needed space, etc. We ""broke up"" many times and somehow always ended up on the slippery slope that led back to some kind of relationship. Very high highs and very low lows. It was a rollercoaster. We had insane chemistry but we were both in our early 20s and very insecure and that manifested in all the bickering and fighting. At a certain point in 2011 I told her I needed to take some space and I haven't talked to her since, even after she reached out a few more times - I didn't respond and she got the hint.

Over the last 10 years I've thought about her on and off, I've dated other people but no one has excited me as much as she did. I haven't felt that kind of chemistry since.

Today I was looking through an old laptop of mine (for other reasons) and inadvertently found an iMessage convo from 2008 that I saved to prove to myself that we could never be ""friends"" (something we tried to do a few times I guess). What the conversation really ended up proving to me was just how responsible I was for all the fights and stress that I used to blame entirely on her. I was pretty damn mean to her and it's all because of my own insecurities at the time and not setting healthy boundaries. The truth is, we probably shouldn't have dated at all after the first time we fought. I should have said, ""nope, not for me, I won't tolerate this, best of luck"" (at the time I WAS astounded at the reason she picked that first fight with me, but after she got over it I shrugged it off, despite finding it very stressful and confusing, and continued to see her).

For some additional background, she was going through some hard times back then, more than I even know. Divorced parents, stepfather becoming deathly ill and I think he passed away at that time, family cat died, body image issues, and all the rest of the coming-of-age issues a young woman has to deal with, issues finding the right fit for university and having enough credits to seamlessly transfer from one to another, prescription pill abuse...

After I stopped talking to her she had some odd outbursts where she even slapped my friend (whom she was living with at the time, just as roommates) but then claimed to others that it was he who slapped her! To be honest, he's probably a hard guy to live with (lol) but I also suspect there were some displaced feelings about me not talking to her anymore that led to that strange violent outburst.

Anyways, it's been a point of pride and discipline for me that I've held out for so long and haven't reached out to her over the years, but I wonder if it's completely justified. I've always felt that there's really nothing good that can come of me reaching out to her, but after reading that text convo I feel like I want her to know that I don't believe all the fighting and stress was all her fault. I've really worked on myself over the years, especially this year, and learned a lot about myself, setting and maintaining healthy boundaries, self-compassion, self-love, self-acceptance, and I've grown immensely. It's clear to me now that I didn't set healthy boundaries for myself and unfairly blamed HER. Considering all the trouble she's gone through and her mental health struggles, I think it could be very liberating and validating for her to hear that. I'm sure I'm also trying to justify ""breaking the line"" I've set of not talking to her for so long, and I'm curious if the chemistry is still there and how she's doing etc. But I honestly do think it could be quite therapeutic for her to hear a genuine apology from me and admission of my responsibility.

i'd like to know the opinion of both men and women, i don't know if this is the right sub. A little context: i am not asexual but i have low interest in women as partners and relationships ( i don't mind being single), so i don't have many experiences. 

I work as a shop assistent in a supermarket, the staff is mostly composed by women ( with few men), and i thought that every woman had an husband or a boyfriend. i wasn't dissapointed because i never try to date a coworker as a personal ethic. i started this job 1 month ago more or less. the coworkers are very informal to each others, joke a lot and are very friendly. i like joking but i am a bit shy/introvert, most of my coworkers noticed that i am a bit silent ( i don't like talking too much when i am working) and tried to make me feel like at home. i appreciated this. i am in my mid 20s

now here it comes my question. there is one coworker, let's call her Claire. Claire has my same age more or less. Claire is not from my country, she's east european. Claire has a similar approach to mine when she's working, she doesn't talk too much ( but i don't think she's shy) and try to be as professional as possible. 2 weeks ago she started behaving in an odd way. My interactions with her were almost 0 before 2 weeks ago because we work in different areas of the supermarket

\- she stared at me different times and in the instances where are our eyes met we both smiled. this happened a lot of times. at first i smiled because i was embarrassed but later i smiled because i enjoyed the attention

\- another coworker, let's call her Jasmine, said to me: "" i saw how Claire look at you, she promised you something ehehehe"" ( this happened 2 weeks ago more or less). i dismissed it as a joke.

\- claire call me with a cute nickname. almost every other coworker use it but she uses it with a different tone

\-claire occasionally called me ""honey"" ( it's not the direct translation but close to it)

\- claire used to call me with no reasons and smiling when she was working close to me.

\- claire has been touchy(touching my arm or my back) for no reason at all in few occasions.

i think i am old enough to understand if a woman is flirting or not and i think Claire was clearly flirting. At first i didn't want to accept it (again, my polacy is no dating between coworkers) but she clearly ignored my other male coworkers and doesn't talk a lot with the female ones. she was obviously different in my presence. and i had to admit to myself that i had a little crush on her

i reflected a lot on how to behave with her. she's a single mom and a coworker, both not an ideal situation for me, but she is good looking, very kind and funny. so i started to flirt back few days ago. i didn't want to ask her out immediatly because i knew she was very busy (she goes back to her daughter every time after work or during the launch break) and i wanted to make sure she was 100% into me before making an obvious move ( because it's my coworker after all). 

but 2 days ago she stopped the flirting. she isn't cold or distant but she doesn't treat me like before. maybe it's a good thing i avoided a potential relationship beetween coworkers, but i am a little dissapointed. did i wait too much or wasn't into me from the beginning?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1135489,public,self,What happened?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/re9dcj/what_happened/,no_ads,0.0,

I am getting a boob job on December 16th. I suffered from anorexia from 15-21 years old and have not relapsed in 5 years. I am so incredibly proud of my recovery it took me a while but with an incredible team of therapists, doctors and my family I got to where I am today. 
Anyways, during puberty, I never developed breasts due to anorexia (I don’t even have the fold of a natural breast). I’m pretty comfortable with my body but, I choose to do a boob job to actually have breasts/be more feminine. I choose silicone and a 240cc implant (so pretty small) with a moderate to low projection. I want my implant to look as natural as possible

Now that surgery is coming up, I’m worried about how men will be. Will men not want to date me due to this?

Yk, he just hates texting. He’s very dry when we do text. He’s not the type to send voice messages. 

I know that texting is not a legitimately realistic form of effective communication. I lack good communication even more so when it comes to him, because I’m forced to say what I’m feeling and why on the spot. Or when I would have to backtrack and give evidence of an action he took to back up why I feel a certain way, on the spot. 

And don’t let my point be explained incorrectly cause then there’s no going back on how I am now seen by him, or may sound to him. I get under pressure and end up being very silent. This is why he usually always has the upper hand in any discussion or disagreement we may have. 

I always let myself down but I do not do well with confrontation and I communicate so much better in my writing. I feel as though it’s best for me to be off something so that I don’t feel any anxiety when we’re talking or ‘arguing’. 

So it angers me that I can’t even have a halfway decent convo with him unless we’re on the phone. 

But can I be mad? I don’t think so.

I have been seeing a woman almost every week for the past 4 months but texting daily and recently calling her daily to wake her up. I met her at a singles event, so we are both looking for something. The reason why it has taken so long to become official is that our city was in lockdown so we could only do simple walking dates. But since we are out of lockdown, we have been going on proper dates together and have had fun together.  We have kissed once. 

About 6 weeks ago, we have spoken about what we want and how our relationship will progress into the future. We also told each other our ages. I am 25M and she’s 38F. We both agreed that we should take it slow and go on a few proper dates when lockdown was lifted. And since we are out of lockdown, we have been going out properly on fun dates. 

To be honest I thought she was thinking we were in a relationship because she has invited me to spend Christmas lunch with her family (I said no because I always spend Christmas with my Family), holding hands in movies and making plans about our financials. 

So tonight I asked her if she wanted to make it official and become my girlfriend. She said `Yeah sure’ but then had doubts about the age difference. We didn’t really talk about it any further and we continued about the night like nothing happened…
And then when we were saying goodbye I was expecting to kiss but all we did was a cheek kiss and a long hug. To be honest it was 2am and we were both tired but still…

This did not go the way I thought it would...

I am honestly so confused as to whether I have a girlfriend or a friend right now.

There was one guy who I had one uneventful date with who actually wanted to drag me into his messy custody battle over his kid, and sorry, but that sent me running for the hills. In my humble opinion, that's a lot to ask of somone *even in an established relationship*. You don't drop that on someone after only one date. That's just messed up.

Then there was this guy who absolutely begged for my attention like a neglected puppy almost constantly. One date and I pretty much got tossed out like garbage, because apparently, he was still pining for his ex girlfriend. Not cool to try to date other people and lead them on if you're still hung up on your ex... Not cool at all, but whatever.

Then there was a guy whose personal hygiene left a LOT to be desired... He was actually nice, but I think he must have had some untreated STI or something. I couldn't stomach the prospect of doing anything sexual with him, because the smells coming off him, from down there, were THAT bad. I'm actually pretty tolerant of gross things, but this just turned my stomach.

Not to bash online dating or everyone on the scene entirely though. I actually met my partner on one - we spent our first date spending like seven or eight hours walking around and just talking. At the end I was sunburned and had blisters all over my feet, but I wouldn't change a thing. It was perfect ❤️

I don’t really have a title, it’s whatever job I’m doing at the time before I quit and do something new. And before anyone reads all of this and tells me I need to work on my confidence, I know that. 

Im just surviving and trying to earn enough money so I can buy a home one day and have some luxurious vacations for time off (I have a bucket list). I don’t have plans to have kids or be a parent either, it has never appealed to me. Although being a housewife and lady of leisure doesn’t sound bad. 

I don’t worry about the future I live in the present. I have high school level education, didn’t get the grades to enter university directly so would’ve had to do something in college (which I started but dropped out) I’m from the UK btw. I didn’t enjoy school much (I was bullied here and there) which really knocked my confidence and trust and I developed a lot of anxiety too and started therapy. Other than that I just wanna be happier and healthy and remain by my loved ones. 

I’ve struggled finding a true passion and something I wish to do with my life. Some times I think about doing voluntary work abroad just to get out of the same routine and perhaps meet some people, whilst getting to see the world. But then I snap back into reality and realise I don’t have the courage for that and I really hate the travelling part. Plus going on vacation is one thing but working and living in another country would make me too home sick I think. 

I also feel like my hobbies aren’t interesting enough either and I’m pretty much a hermit. But I love being alone. I don’t mind doing things if my friends and family invite me to things but most of the time I don’t go out. I have few friends because I’m not very outgoing, I have social anxiety and struggle making friends with people I actually like. Friends will usually initiate plans and organise things for us to do but most of the time it’s just going for dinner and drinks or going to a bar on the weekend. Which is fun. A concert here and there too or shopping trip. 
But In my free time I’m usually tired from work (I have waves of depression which I’ve been in therapy for) so I’d rather chill and be by myself. I enjoy going on walks, eating and watching YouTube/reading forums too. 

I’m worried that when I try dating I won’t be good enough. Ive been on dating apps and so many people of my generation (20s) look like they have so much more going for them. A lot of university graduates with buzzing social life’s and dreams and goals. But why do i care about others? I enjoy the simple things I guess… and I don’t care enough to go and chase a career that I genuinely have no interest in. Sometimes I feel embarrassed telling people that I work in a warehouse picking and packing orders all day. And before that I worked in a care home doing jobs most people don’t wanna do, I’ve also done housekeeping. Sometimes I feel like people judge me and see my jobs as lower or something, or ask why a young thing like me is doing these jobs.

Every  relationship I've been in has started organically IRL, but that doesn't  seem like an easy thing to pursue anymore. Moving states recently has  kept me disconnected from my old friends, and I don't have a network to  mingle around anymore, or events to go to. So I really need to start  over from scratch and kind of ""learn to date"", probably mostly through  apps. Are there any especially useful resources on the current dating  landscape for our age groups? Outside of that, have any of you had luck  with IRL singles events? I've never been to one. Should I start up  social media again - and would you find it weird if your date wasn't on  IG/FB? (I keep a linkedin - that's it.)

I'm  also worried about starting to date again with my current lifestyle and  what I'm doing in life. My professional career is secure, but I'm in  college for the first time and as a result live just like I did when I  was 20 - roommates, shared bathroom - this is not normal for my age in  my area. I make above-average income and have nice things, but live like  this to ensure I can finish school without needing to gap semesters to  keep finances healthy. Between how I live and how busy I am I kind of  feel more like three raccoons in a trench coat than an adult, although I  keep my spaces tidy. I've been considering renting a studio or master  bedroom just to make dating easier. Would you see any of this as a  deal-breaker?

Do you like dogs? 
Do you believe in God?
How important is your family in your daily routine?

I felt like I was being interviewed for a position and kinda stayed quiet for a couple days, we started to talk later on and after a few days we agreed to meet. He lives 4 hours away from me and he is 38 years old (for context), I’m 34.

We agreed to meet on a Saturday but I had to cancel that morning since my dad was sick and I was taking care of him, he understood, I was a bit bummed since I wanted to meet him, and most importantly, go out and have a bit of a normal day for a chance.

That same day he called to find out how my day was and also mentioned he had bought a gift for me and will need my address to send it over or even deliver it himself if possible. He then admitted that even tho I cancelled, he drove all the way down just to hand me the gift and hopefully have coffee with me, I thought that was super sweet so I got ready and we went out for dinner.

However, something about this guy didn’t click for me, he is handsome, is a doctor, has several jobs, a very stable life and somehow he had only had one boyfriend and several attempts, there had to be a catch… 

During our dinner date he said - I need to tell you I’m a bit intense when it comes to relationships, I give it all and I want it all - I thought it was a bit too much for a first date but I told him I understand his position.

He kissed me on the way back home and he smelled soooooo freaking good (a major turn on for me), it was a nice day.

We continued to talk and later on I told him I had planned a trip abroad for over a month, he was shocked when I told him that and said - what am I going to do without you? - his friend was with us and she said - don’t be ridiculous, you’ll be fine -

We agreed on meeting before I left, he took me to a nice restaurant for birthday dinner and brought another gift (I’m not used to giving people lol), then we went home and things happened.

The day prior to my departure he came again and hugged me, but he started to cry, I asked why and he said he loves me, I mean, I know it takes a long time for me to tell someone I love them, but I just hugged him and avoided the extra details.

Now during the trip: 

We texted daily and even did video calls, however, one morning he called me freaking out and demanding details of the people I was staying with. It looks like he did major research overnight and thought I was the -type- of my friends and they would probably try to take advantage of that. I told him it was too early for a mess like that and that he should actually take some time for himself to get on track and feel better, I encouraged him to stop texting or talking and do something healthy instead, we didn’t talk for like 4 days until he sent audios crying and saying he was sorry about his attitude.

Worst part is what he understood as - do something healthy - to cope with his anxiety:

He asked his friend to create a chat group, name it - My gift from god + My name - she added him but immediately left the group so that it would only be him talking to an empty group, and he used it to pretend he was texting me, that actually scared me a lot.

So this is the thing, I really developed feelings for him since he is very sweet, but I’m also scared of the things he does, I have kept my distance and we text more under control now, but it’s only a matter of minutes for him to go crazy again and come up with something weird.

I(23F) am in a “situationship” with a guy I met on Hinge. We went on a first date about 2 months ago and it was the best I’ve ever had. We get along well, we have the same views and morals, we like the same things, and we are both Christian (this will become important later). We have continued to hang out on a regular basis since then. He’s met my friends and we’ve hung out and done a few activities together, but we often hang out at his house. 

I started out with some pretty solid boundaries. I said that I was not going to do anything on the first date and that I was very strictly not going to have sex with him for the foreseeable future. But as we hung out some more and things happened, we made out some and did a little bit more here and there. This was a pretty big thing for me, as I have never dated or done anything physical with a guy. After a few boundaries had been crossed (consensually), I wanted to have a conversation outlining some stricter boundaries for myself as I believe that certain things should wait until marriage, or at least a committed relationship. My boundaries stood for a while, which was easy for me. Mostly because, not only was it something I was planning to wait on, but I am also very nervous and somewhat insecure when it comes to sexual things. After quite a bit of waiting, which involved fooling around, I asked him what kind of relationship we had. The good old DTR…

He said he wants to wait on becoming a couple because he has screwed up in the past and he is hoping to marry the next person he dates and he wants fewer regrets. I am totally in the same boat, however, we are opposites in our expectations. His expectations involve becoming closer with me physically/sexually before he is comfortable opening up emotionally. My expectations involve becoming closer emotionally/spiritually before getting too involved physically/sexually. He didn’t wait until marriage (obviously) to have sex, so he knows what he’ll be missing if he chooses to stay with me. I have decided to wait (and he is aware that I will not have sex with him), not because I am a Christian, but because I have waited so long already and I think it would be best for me to wait until marriage. That’s not to say I won’t do some things. I am just struggling with the fact that we are basically at a standstill because neither of us want to give in to the other’s wishes in fear of getting hurt. (Oh, he also has a troubled past, which could be the reason he is also hesitant.)
Is that a guy thing or is he manipulating me? 

He is still being weird about us, but everything is there besides a label at this point. It also kind of stresses me out that I haven’t been invited to meet or hang out with his friends, but he has hung out with mine many times. Is that a bad sign?

We made plans to get dinner and then see a play at a local theater that our mutual friend was in. I know that’s a little bit of a strange first date since we can’t chat, but again we were friends before this.

Anyways, dinner was going FANTASTIC. She was dressed to impress or looked amazing in this little black dress. We chatted easily, flirted, she grabbed my arm on the way, it couldn’t have gone better. I did start need to use the bathroom at the restaurant, but figured there would be time to go at the theater before the play and didn’t think about it.

However, there was a massive crash on the highway and driving to the theater took 45 minutes instead of the 10 it was supposed. When we got to the theater the lights were blinking and they were already making a last call before the doors closed. I tried to say to her that I needed to run to the bathroom, but she grabbed my hand and ran with me to the door and I felt really awkward and embarrassed trying to break that off, and also didn’t want to get locked out of the theater.

Once the play started it took a good amount of my energy to not squirm constantly and embarrass myself with a “pee pee dance” but I figured I would be ok until intermission. Our seats were also in the middle of the aisle and this cute girl was holding my hand and I didn’t want to embarrass myself by jumping up in the middle of the play and running out of the theater. And then about an hour in I learned a fun surprise, there was no intermission. Awesome!

Once the play was finally over I was seriously dying. I was squeezing my leg muscles together and getting seriously worried I might leak in my pants. The theater was taking FOREVER to empty and I was standing up by my seat waiting for the people in front of us to clear out of the way. My date now decides it’s the perfect time to lean her hips into mine and whisper “don’t laugh but I seriously need to pee right now” I was so nervous at this point that I was stuttering and told her I needed to go too. 

I don’t know what the final straw was, but as we we waiting by our chairs I couldn’t hold it anymore and started to go. I don’t mean a small leak, I just started to full on wet my pants right there. She was still pressed up against me and I instinctively pushed her away and backed up and tried to hide what was happening with my hands. She looked confused and asked “what’s wrong” and then a second later her eyes drifted down and saw my jeans go from a quarter sized wet patch, to one the size of a large dinner plate. 

I’ll never forget the look on her face. Her beautiful brown eyes turned as wide as saucers and and gave an audible “oh” and then her hands covered her mouth. A few other people nearby started looking over and noticing what was happening. My dates face turned red and I think she was embarrassed to be with me. She then tucked her hair behind her ear and gave me a fake smile and said “just, push through the crowd” and sort of shewed me away. I was pushing my way through the sea of people trying to rush to the bathroom. I looked back at my date still standing by her chair and her she had her phone out and she was giggling to herself. 

I got to the bathroom finally and the damage was done. My jeans were wet past my knees and it was super obvious what happened. I had no idea what to do. I drove both of us there too and didn’t know what to do about the ride home. After about 10 minutes I decided to just leave the bathroom and play it by ear. As soon as I leave I see my date talking with our mutual friend who was in the play. My friend (a woman BTW) starts laughing as soon as she sees me. I think I see my date say to her “be nice and don’t say anything.” 

I walk over and my date keeps glancing at my crotch. Her face is beat red and embarrassed herself. She presses her lips together and asks “you doing ok?” As our friend continues to giggle. I am so humiliated that I can’t even spit out a coherent sentence but mutter “I’m good”. My date tells me she’ll get a ride home from our friend and I sort of just sulk back to my car.

I texted her the next day just saying “hopefully we can do it again soon” and she responded with a crying face emoji and “yeah maybe.” That was a few hours ago and I don’t know what to do from here and pretty sure I blew my chance with an amazing girl. Any advice on what to do?

He brought up the subject of friends and I just kind of awkwardly tried to avoid saying straight out I don't really have friends, but he noticed and said, ""Wait, do you not have ANY friends?!?!!""

He kept asking me questions about it and said he was just fascinated because he'd never known anyone like me that was so closed off from people before (fascinated in a very bad way, because his entire tone was like What the f\*ck is wrong with you??). He suggested I try Bumble BFF and go to therapy.

He pretty much tried to psychoanalyze me the entire time (when he wasn't too busy laughing at me), trying to figure out what happened to make me like this.

She always flirts with me. She comes up with reasons that I have to see her after school to work on stuff. We talk for hours sometimes. She flirts with me, laughs, touches my hands and arms when she talks. This has been going on for a month. I actually like her and developed a crush on her.

Then, after a month of this, yesterday during a convo about COVID and doing things for fun, she casually says she has a bf she met online during covid who lives an hour away. She then asks me if I'm dating anyone and I say not seriously. It floored me. Not this s#it again.

He entered into a long term relationship, and so did I.

Then when I was leaving, I hugged his parents and brothers, again thinking it would be for the best.

 I'm actually quite nerdy and really into intellectual discussion and exploring different perspectives. So quite often, I try to match with women who have / are working on graduate degrees. I'm a software engineer by profession, but I've met women working on other fields such as healthcare, finance, public policy and it's a cool way to explore different perspectives and broaden my horizons.

Of course there are hookups and the physical pleasure element too. That's always fun, I'll be honest, no need for further elaboration there.

Lastly, there is an implicit motivator to be more attractive. Like I'm already physically active and workout primarily for long term health and improved performance in sports. But I'll be honest in that wanting to be more physically attractive to women is another motivator for me to keep working out, eating healthy and being well rested consistently. 

Being more attractive isn't just about my body too. There's also my clothes and social skills which I have improved since using dating apps. I think we all know that being better dressed and having social skills are very beneficial.

I met a great girl on eHarmony. We talked for hours and wanted all the same things: to find a strong emotional bond that could have the potential to turn into marriage and starting a family one day.

We hung out. It was great. With out conversations, the chemistry was just instant. We gave each other kisses, smiled, laughed together. It was the first time in years I felt such a spark, and that includes actual relationships I was in.

After a few weeks, I invited her over. We hung out, cuddled, kissed. One thing led to another and we had sex. It was great and we were both out of breath afterward. We cuddled and talked of a future together. I wanted to ask her to be bf/gf but enjoyed the natural flow of things so much I decided not to push for it.

Fast forward a few days later and she said her ex texted her out of nowhere for the first time in months. She said she  was previously in a long term relationship and thought she was over him but now is confused and has to take a step back and figure things out.

We did an escape room in town, got some food, and we went back to her place. While we were there she didn't want to do anything intimate, but she was eager to arrange a second date and so was I. She's told me she wants to go very slowly, which is okay by me. We've bonded over a few weeks prior to this date. 

As a preface to this, I've been unsuccessful for dating for a few years. I've had plently of dates, but for one reason or another things haven't worked out. I'm liking that this is going well but I feel continually on edge as every time this has happened I get heart broken. I've been out of a relationship for 5 years, and haven't had sex for two.

With the second date coming up, an entirely alien situation's happened to me. A school sweetheart (Girl B) who'd I'd had a bit of a crush on and had been in a relationship for the better part of a decade has broken up several months ago, hit the gym in a BIG way, and flat out invited me to sleep with her (phrased in a more creative way). This is a complete fantasy made real. 

I like the girl I've started dating and it's going well, but it remains to be seen if this is going to continue (we haven't even discussed the 'big' dating questions like wanting kids, nor is there any hint if we're sexually compatible yet). She's heading back up to the netherlands in a few days after our upcoming second date to see family, so I'm probably not going to see her until new years. 

So reddit, what would be your opinion on taking up the offer of Girl B while I'm in the early stages of dating Girl A? Is this morally wrong? Should I try and buy some time with Girl B to see if things with Girl A is going to progress? Is there a way to articulate to Girl B that I want to, but I've just started seeing someone and want to see if it pans out, or would that make them feel completely inadquete? 

I have anxiety that there's a real path here that causes me to lose both opportunities, and return to the utter sheer hell of dating which I honestly can't bare anymore. I am deeply craving intitmacy at this point.
