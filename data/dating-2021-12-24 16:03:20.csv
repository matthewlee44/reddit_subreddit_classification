0,rnvxej,1640383437,My response to all the body count posts,"Sorry if this is the wrong group for this…

I’m seeing a heap of posts about people’s body count and how higher numbers and causing discomfort and wanted to share a quick story time.

When I was 21(f) I was seeing a guy for a while and when it started to get a bit more serious the body count discussion came up. 
He was super nervous and didn’t want to say anything but finally said “48” under his breath.
My response?
“Awww, it would have such a better ring to it if I were number 50”

To me the person and their personality is way more important than body count - sure it’s an aspect that can be taken into consideration but if you’re willing to throw away a good person because their body count seems “too high” for you, please let them go so they can find someone who will fully appreciate them xx",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rnvxej/my_response_to_all_the_body_count_posts/
1,rnw2v2,1640383955,Is my [22F] boyfriend [43M] too old for me?,"Hi, so these past couple of weeks, I'm starting to wonder if my boyfriend is in fact too old for me. I met him when I was 16 and lied about my age (Yes I know it's stupid and wrong I was really young...). We started dating when I was 17 and at the age of 18 I told him I lied and he was pretty mad but forgave me after a while. I love him a lot.
After nearly 6 years together, we're now engaged and we started talking about trying for a baby. I have my doubt, as I'm still studying. I see all my friends partying and having fun, while I'm at home with a guy twice my age. And of course I do these things too but way less. I love him to death and he always tells me I'm the love of his life, that he wants us to stay together ""until he dies"". I grew very attached and I love everything about him. He's loving, cares a lot, gives me a lot of love, spoils me, he is handsome, I'm super attracted to him, sex is really good, and he even pays for the integrality of university and all my stuffs. I am NOT with him because of money and I'm very grateful.
The age gap is kinda big so our interests are pretty different. We don't have a lot in common. Sometimes, it feels like hanging out with my dad. Even my own dad is younger than him (he's 41). I feel guilty as hell but a couple of months ago we were on a break. It lasted a month and I was seeing another guy. He was my age and it felt good to be with someone who understood a little. It feels like we're world away lol. I caught myself fantasizing about being with guys my age lately. He knows I saw this guy and it makes him feel bad about himself. He now tells me he's old and a young woman like me shouldn't be with an ""old man"" like him. He tells me he gets why I went for a younger guy. He kinda turns it as a joke but I know it hurts him.
I love him and I feel bad for even thinking about stuffs like that when I have an amazing boyfriend, who loves me and will always be here for me. I don't know what to do anymore. I wanna live my life like people my age do. But I love him and wanted to marry him. Is there any way to make a relationship works with a big age gap like that?
Edit: Everytime I talk about him, I receive a lot of PMs asking what kinda guy he is, if he's stable, has been married, have kids etc. And yes it could make a difference so here it is. He has a high-earning job (diplomatic work),has a condo but currently has a new house under construction. He's really stable. Been married 5 years with a woman his age in his 30's before meeting me...He doesn't have kids. I live with him since I'm 18. Also lots of people asked me about what my parents think. I saw my dad 2 times in my life. He's a genitor to me that's it. My mom didn't know about it until I turned 18. She didn't really care about where I was going, who I was with, etc as a kid. She keeps telling me he's too old but is happy he takes care of me and pays for uni as well as my other needs.
TL;DR: My boyfriend and I have different interests because of this big age gap, I kinda want to be with guys my age, I don't know how to make it work.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rnw2v2/is_my_22f_boyfriend_43m_too_old_for_me/
2,rnwi0w,1640385364,It's almost impossible to fall in love...,"I know this a rather ridiculous thing to complain about, but it genuinely feels like my love-compass is broken. Growing up, I'm not humbling myself when I say I was a real ugly duckling. I always fantasized about a life where people would notice me and think I'm pretty, and where I would get lots of attention of boys- typical girl stuff, I suppose.

Skip a few years, and those shooting stars seemed to have finally answered my calls. The irony of it all? I can barely fall in love. After my first breakup, it took around 1.5 years before I finally found someone who made me feel warm inside again. When that relationship ended, my recharge period lasted around the same time.

I don't understand *why* it's happening. It's like every 1.5 years, my heart finally opens back up again and focuses on the next best person it sees. My exes are so different from one another, it's hard for me to understand what it is that attracts me. 

The last time I fell in love was in summer this year. That ""relationship"" ended even before it really started, and in a way, that makes it suck so much more. In my head, it feels like I waited almost two years for that supernova of romance. And now, the timer has reset.

4,rnwpq2,1640386061,Taking a break from OLD and Dating in general. Any one else do this?,"I (27/f) am gonna take a break from online dating. For more context, my longest relationship of 2.5 years ended a couple months ago and after about 2 weeks I jumped right back into the online dating scene. That lasted a good month, I met two matches. Neither were really what I was looking for and in just that short amount of time I almost feel burnt out by swiping and trying to find “something”.

It hit me this weekend that I don’t know what that “something” is. I broke up with my ex because I knew he wasn’t my forever and I felt like I was wasting my time (long story short) but now I’m not sure what I actually want and I am not dating with intention.

So I’m gonna take a step back for 3 months (90 days exactly) and figure out what type of guy I’m looking for, work on my confidence and assertiveness/self esteem, save some money to feel more secure in dating, and to really sit with myself for 90 days as jumping back into online dating really f*king humbled me.

7,rnwyem,1640386875,I guess I’m getting ghosted? Hard to tell,"So a bit of backstory. I am aware that for some reason I always end up dating women who are emotionally unavailable to me. Idk why, it’s basically the only constant in my life, so I’m used to it but this most recent one has really messed me up. 

Met a women at a music festival in a state neither of us live in but we hit it off immediately. She was bartending when we met(we both had lived in the city of the festival) so she was helping an old employer out who was short staffed. I never bother bartenders trying to get numbers but she actually just gave me hers and told me to text her the next day. I do that, we had the following 2 days to hang then head back to our respective homes. 

I get home and I’m totally smitten and tell her to come visit me out west for a trip. She books the trip and actually makes sure she books it to spend her birthday with me! I feel blessed and we have a really great few days together and get pretty close. We realize we have way more in common than we thought. Total a hit of a wknd imo, and I’m just pumped. We continue to talk but it’s clearly going to be hard to continue through the holidays via FaceTime and text. So I say fuck it, I work remote and can fly to see her before the holidays. I make sure she is ok with it before I book the ticket and she is ecstatic that I’m coming to the east coast. I make sure she understands I am going to be in her space and that can be overwhelming etc. she says do it, because guys she’s been with even her ex’s would never do something like that. Im willing to send it for various  personal reasons but mostly I want to see if the flames are real. 

Everything leading up is good but once I arrive I can tell something is off. Now I acknowledge that she works 11 hr shifts and that sucks to come home to me being there. What I didn’t realize was she and I met 1 month after she had to pack up her car and drove across the country to get out of the last relationship. Bad timing, but she said that she didn’t realize how much she had to grow until I had arrived. It was like a freight train had hit her life and the fun of having a guy she could talk to was too real now that I was there. I even asked if I should change my flight and get out of her hair. I want to respect her space and emotions but she kept saying “no I want you here.” I’m more than happy to stay, I like being with her. 

Finally on the trip to the airport for me to leave we talk about us. It’s clear she likes me and wants me around. She says “I want to keep talking to you.” And “I don’t know when we are going to see each other again but I hope it’s soon!” I ask for a few days to breath the trip out and think, she says that’s reasonable gives me a big hug and a bunch of intimate kisses. 

I get home take a few days. I will admit my life is a mess rn and think I really shouldn’t try to push this, but I want her in my life in some fashion. Idk what that looks like or what I expect but I know I care for her. 

After a few days I shoot her a text just saying how I miss her and want to talk soon if she up for it… nothing back. I send a follow up text the next day just to do my personal due diligence and no response. Now I spiraling, we talked for a little over 3 months basically FaceTime everyday, we both visited each other, to me there is something there. 

I guess should I just move on knowing that this was probably only ever some post relationship fun? Should I give it more time and reach out? Should I send a text before the end of the year? Saying what I don’t know.  

I like this women, and everything she said is reassuring of her liking me and I can really see us together. Maybe I’m a hopeless romantic who already knows the answer but am to afraid to admit it to myself. Would love some internet thoughts.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rnwyem/i_guess_im_getting_ghosted_hard_to_tell/

I don’t know what he felt, but for me, it seemed like we hit it off and were both feeling it. We went to the bars and to a mini kickback where we drank, ate, and just chilled with mutual people we know from school. There was a lot of touching,  him being very close to me, and he saw who I really am with no filter, and outside of all the drama and petty rumors. He ended up inviting me to his place where one thing led to another and we hooked up. He told me that we didn't have to, but at that moment I was really feeling it so it happened.  He drove me home the next morning and as I was getting out of the car and saying thanks for everything, he basically said that if I want to hangout with him again to let him know, and that during the holidays it is a busy time, but to text him and he'll check his schedule and let me know (he's a athlete, mom passed away and has to take care of sibling, and spends time w his guy friends.) I wasn’t sure if he legit meant that hes interested in hanging out with me again or is just trying to be friendly so I  told him to text me when he’s free and we can figure something out. but im not even sure if he was saying that to be friendly or if he seriously meant that he wants to see me again and that he's interested.  if anyone can give their insight, it would be very helpful!!

Whenever I had any interactions with guys irl and they actually seemed sort of interested in me I would shut it down immediately and not want to continue stuff with them which would then make it weird and I never spoke to them again. I feel like I’m scared of failure and rejection tbh.

11,rnx7dg,1640387717,Advice: Try real life dating,"I see a lot of people on here who are trying to date exclusively online. I think often it's very hard to know whether you get on with someone online, and you're often basing opinions purely on appearance - which isn't ideal for many. 

My advice would be to try the real world. I know that a lot of men are afraid to approach women, and a lot of women don't want to be approached in their daily life. So here is a little advice: if you are looking to approach women, then don't ever do it in a place that they have to be (at work, grocery shopping, petrol station, etc). Instead try approaching them at places they choose to be (bars, sports clubs, other activities). As a general rule, you should get to know someone before you ask them out, but if you want to go straight into asking someone out then I suggest you say something along the lines of 'hey, would you like to go for a coffee/drink with me sometime?', and then be respectful of their answer - whatever it is! This is important, if someone rejects you, then respect this and don't suddenly stop talking to them or become cold (and definitely don't become angry or aggressive!!). The better everyone deals with rejection, the more relaxed people will become, and the easier it will be to ask people out (as they won't constantly be scared of someone going mad if they reject them).

12,rnx8ds,1640387813,Amazing chemistry and then radio silence,"My cousins(24) best friend (23) and I(23)hit it off at my cousins birthday last weekend. 

We spent the whole night talking and got on so well. He asked if he could add me on Snapchat and added himself on my phone. He added me back the next morning at 6am when he got home.

I had to leave without getting a chance to say goodbye so I sent him a text as I left and after adding me back he didn't open it for 15 hours and when he did he didn't reply. I am so confused! I really thought we hit it off :( 

I asked my cousin and he said not to worry and to play it by ear but I'm finding it hard to drop it because of how well we got on and the hours of chats we had. 

Everytime we got called to come dance to a song or would go to the bathroom we would find our way back together again. 

A mutual friend of ours who the guy doesn't know I am close with told me he said I was lovely and gorgeous but he had to take things slow because I am his friends cousin when I was in the bathroom at rhe party. Another friend of mine found him on tinder today where he was ""recently active"". 

He is definitely an awkward guy and I wouldn't think he gets many girls but I am definitely equally as awkward but just more outwardly confident. I usually think if he wanted to he would text but I just can't seem to drop this one. Any advice?

13,rnx8hx,1640387824,Confused by a convo with my new gf about religion,"So, I have a new gf. She’s atheist. I’m not religious. I grew up fundamentalist and then went through all the motions of deconversion, and now I’m probably agnostic or theist but Idt I’ll ever reconcile a particular religious view. 

Anyways, from some convos about fundamentalism, and how opposed we both are, I think she started to get the vibe I’m still kinda religious? I struggled with addiction and refused to let religion be a part of it (very against the philosophy of some addiction treatments that incorporate religion) I tried clarifying the above, and added one day I could be but it wouldn’t change my politics / worldview because it’s all subjective. I wouldn’t raise my family that way etc. it’s all personal and I’m not even religious now lol but I think it turned her off. Our Xmas Eve FaceTime ended soon after and clarifying via text after Idt helped. I’m really not religious and I can’t help but feel this is kinda odd. And it’s shitty to be confused on this holiday…

I feel like this shouldn’t affect our relationship since I’m not really religious. I do pray some out of OCD tendencies. Anyways, any thoughts ? I just feel kinda confused and shitty that this mattered. I feel kinda labeled and that’s what I hate about fundamentalism so I’m thrown off a non religious person is labeling me…

Anyways, like I said the explanation text after probably didn’t help so later I just said “I’m not religious, I really like you” and said I’d spend time with my family and hoped she’d have a good time with hers 🤷🏼‍♂️ I’m just very confused cause everything has been so great.

I am so vocal to him that I don't know about that stuff and I might ask him a lot of dumb questions.

He likes it. He likes talking to me about them even though I don't bring much on the table when it comes to this topic. When I asked him why he likes talking to me about them, he told me that it makes him happy that I am listening to him and seems like I am interested to what he's talking about.

I just really don't wanna blow it off. Earlier today I sent him a Michael Scott gif saying ""why don't you explain it to me like I am five?""

The issues i've found is I think when others see how I look they immediately project an image of me as a person and they aren't interested.

The reasoning behind this is i've matched with others through dating personals on sites such as reddit and really got into some interesting conversations and then as soon as I show a picture of myself i'm left in the dark and no one responds. This has happened twice now already.
The main response I get when someones does respond is that I look ""cute"" which is fine but that seems to be a by-word for either ""I see you as a friend"" or ""I'm going to stop talking to you now"".

I don't know if this is just me being self conscious but I was wondering if there is anything I can do about this.
To be honest I get way more men asking me out on dates than women which would be great if I was even a little bicurious, but i'm not.

15 minutes after the date, he texted me saying “I can't tell you how much I enjoyed dinner and our conversation and meeting you. I can't wait to hang out again.” And I reciprocated the sentiment. 

We didn’t speak until two days later though. He texted me a meme (relevant to one of our conversations). And I responded, thinking it’d open up a conversation, but it didn’t lead to one. So two days pass again, and I sent him a text, to which he responded - but not in a way that allowed for a conversation to start. Just an acknowledgment of the text. 

It’s been a few days since and we haven’t spoken. We have both traveled away from home for the holidays, so we won’t get the opportunity to see each other again until New Years. Though - the lack of communication has me wondering if he’s lost interest.

I've noticed in the past few months that nearly every guy I've went on more than one date with, doesn't seem to want me for more than anything beyond a hookup. I'm not one who does hookups and I tend to make this known early on in the talking phase. Some men have been honest and eventually told me that they were only looking for something casual, despite being on a couple of dates with me. This usually happens before I even consider putting out for them. And I appreciate these people for their honesty. But I also don't understand if I'm just not relationship material, or I'm meeting the wrong people

Two weeks ago, I got my heart broken by this guy who claimed that he was looking for something serious. There was a lot of chemistry and sexual tension and before he tried to take things to the bedroom, I told him ""I don't have sex outside of relationships."" He then said ""how about I call you my girlfriend then?"" I agreed and like a naive little girl, I had sex with him thinking that we were now exclusive. A few days later, his interest levels drop (he doesn't text or call me as often) and it's fairly obvious that he only wanted me for sex despite what he told me. Then 2 weeks later, I notice something is off since his enthusiasm levels drop. He doesn't even ask me how my day is going anymore. So I explained to him how I felt, and he took this as me being needy, but also reassured me that he wouldn't just break up with me/lose interest out of nowhere. To no one's surprise, he breaks up with me the very next day and blames it on my anxiety. Then proceeded to block me everywhere. I feel so distraught and used, especially since I place a lot of value on respecting my body. 

I've also been dumped in the past for simply refusing to have sex in the first month of the relationship, except the guy never admitted it nor did he claim that that's what he was after. I don't understand why a lot of guys lie about their intentions in order to get a girl in bed.

Among my people, there is an obsession with light features such as blue eyes, pale rosy skin and blonde hair.

Due to the increased demand for such appearance the women will go to great  lengths to bleach their hair, get nose jobs, avoid the sun and some even wear blue contacts. I have lived abroad previously and I was not considered attractive by the locals nor do I expect them to find me attractive.

Therefore there is no place where I can be attractive. How do I solve this problem for myself? I'm tired of hearing the men of my country talking about wanting to marry a german or swedish or latvian girlfriend and treating the local women as someone to have a night stand with at best.

32,rnybms,1640391482,Should I break up with my boyfriend because of his mom?,"Long story:

So I've dated my boyfriend for over 7 years now. Most of those years have been spent long distance while I was in university. My boyfriend lives by himself in my hometown. His mother insists on spending every holiday and birthday with him even though those are the only times I get to see him due to school. She often stays over at his house on those days and my boyfriend doesn't want me to stay over at the same time because he gives up his bed for his mother to sleep and he stays on the couch. I found this annoying but tolerated it because it's his mom.

This past year our relationship has been thrown a curve ball more or less. His mom said some horrible opinions about me saying that I'm taking advantage of him because I have less money then him and he often pays for our dates. She further got mad at me because I didn't automatically pay for everyone's movie theatre snacks because I thought I heard that she was going to pay. 

I found all of this very hurtful as I had to pay for my travel every time to come visit him which came out to roughly $500 round trip. I come down about 4 times a year making it about $2000 that I pay to go see him. He never came up to visit me while I was in school since I went to school in a small town and there wasn't much to do there. So I would always come down to see him. I just feel bad because my contribution isn't being seen and bad things are being said about me over $20. 

She's also made some strange comments wanting to know details of our sex life. She said that she plans on moving right next door to my boyfriend and I when we move in together. She also stated that when we have kids she'll be taking care of them all the time. To be honest those comments made me so uncomfortable that I  no longer wanted to marry my boyfriend or have kids with him.

I've talked with my boyfriend since that day about it all made me feel. I also said that I didn't feel comfortable with his mother staying over at his house especially since we were planning on moving in together. When he told his mother that she couldn't say those things about me. His mother in turn didn't speak to my boyfriend for a week because she got so mad. I am just moving in with my boyfriend now but I'm afraid that I will have to put up with more insults from his mom.

His mom lives alone and doesn't have a partner in life so I feel like she is overly possessive of her son. My boyfriend has grown up being her main support in life. He knows that what his mom is doing and saying is wrong but doesn't want to upset anyone. But I feel like now it's starting to drive a wedge between my boyfriend and I.

I'm not sure if I should break up with him over this. On one hand I don't know how this can work if we can't set boundaries between us and his mom. On the other it's not his fault that his mom is acting this way and I understand that I'm dating him not his mom. On the other hand, I don't deserve to have those comments said about me. I'm anxious about how I'm going to be treated over more real issue if my name is already being dragged through the mud over nothing. My boyfriend has said that he is on my side no matter what but I still  don't like how I'm being treated.what should I do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rnybms/should_i_break_up_with_my_boyfriend_because_of/

I worry that not having experience is going to attract people who want to take advantage of me and I won't know how to handle that.

I pay for tinder gold so I can at least have a chance at getting seen and I have infinite swipes. I also have my age range from 18 to 100, and my distance range at 100 miles. Once a day, I will spend an hour when I wake up and an hour before I go to bed swiping right. swiping right. I will use my super swipes on the first five shown and I’ll use a boost whenever I get. I know this sounds like a lot but it’s really not. And it’s the only time I use it.

I kind of got the vibe from his texts he was inexperienced honestly and thought it was so sweet. 

After our 1st date, he still would never let conversations die and give thoughtful responses, but he started limiting his responses to once daily. Even if I'd respond sooner, he would limit it. I still liked him though and found this pace much more manageable although the change in pattern bothered me a little and made me nervous. 

After our third date, I decided to initiate a text and ask him out again after the holidays.  He replied but this time didn't try to continue the conversation continually lile he normally does and let it end once I stopped trying to continue it. 

I actually deleted his number after this figuring he must have lost interest but then he did reach out a couple days ago after not hearing from him for three days to check in, but again let the conversation end and it was very brief. 

I am debating to reach out to him in a couple days to check in as well since he did last time, but part of me is hesitant because of the change in texting pattern. If he texted like this from the beginning it wouldn't have bothered me at all, but I just can't help but feel maybe he lost interest or something. I just feel like this guy maybe likes the chase and by initiating a date he feels like he has me and is now putting in less effort and by initiating I might scare him away for good.

39,rnz11a,1640393950,Not Ready to DTR,"Happy Holidays Everyone,

I’ve (M28) been seeing someone for about two and a half months. I really like this person and it Is definitely reciprocated.

I told this person that I was ready to take next steps and define the relationship (DTR) but I understood if she didn’t feel the same way (hints from an earlier conversation told me she wasn’t, but I wanted her to know how I feel).

She basically said with as little words that she was still processing how she felt. Weeks later, she said that she was still unpacking pain from her previous relationship that ended in April, not so much the relationship but being dumped over text after a seven month relationship. 

I knew about this pain from when I invited her to a friend’s birthday party and she started crying about opening back up again and bringing me into her life to meet friends/family. 

So clearly I don’t think she’s over her past relationship, but another flag went up recently when she was on her way to visit her parents for the holiday and her claddagh ring was flipped in the “not seeing anyone” direction when she had flipped it in the “seeing someone” direction for the last month.

This could have been a mistake that I’m reading into and I don’t really want to make it the center of the conversation I want to have on the subject, but I am just starting to feel a little emotionally wrung out and conscious that the person I’m seeing probably shouldn’t be dating.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rnz11a/not_ready_to_dtr/

I recently broke up with my bf “J” (19M) about a month ago. We didn’t date for long and honestly I may have been too emotionally invested but the way it ended really hurt me. Things were going literally perfect then he just ghosted me. He put my number on do not disturb and I’ve never heard from him again. I felt like I was on an emotional rollercoaster because I was genuinely worried if he was ok. I got to the point where I was ready to move on, then I got a bullshit text about him being in a car accident and didn’t have his phone. The text came from his “mom”. I still don’t know if that was even true because I never heard from him since. I felt helpless and cried a lot, pretty much everyday. I was in denial about the relationship being over because I wanted to believe so badly that he had enough respect for me to tell me straight up that things weren’t working out. 

The guy I was dating before him also ended things with me by ghosting me. We were never official so I just chalked it up him not wanting a relationship and moved on. The breakup with J felt way more emotionally draining. After realizing this was his cowardly way of ending things I felt pathetic for crying over someone who didn’t even care about me. I tried to better myself, I got therapy and started going to the gym and bettering myself. 

I have abandonment issues and I don’t have any friends. This didn’t by any means help my abandonment issues, I didn’t expect us to stay together forever. I just didn’t like how he chose to end things. I tried dating again, I hopped back on bumble but nothing feels the same. I’m not trying to say he was my soulmate or compare everyone to him but we clicked. We connected on literally everything. We could take for 6 hours straight without even taking a second to breathe. We even related on the weirdest stuff. We connected instantly since I messaged him on Bumble. It felt too good to be true and it was.

Everyone else in comparison seems dry. I started talking to a few guys but I genuinely don’t think it can be a relationship because it doesn’t feel the same. The conversations die off, I’m constantly trying to find something to say to keep it going. They’re not bad people it just doesn’t feel the same. It’s to the point where I’m about to just delete bumble, I know that may sound dramatic but I’m tired.

57,ro0la0,1640399733,Does she like me or is she just super friendly?,"So there’s this girl (18F) that I (18M) have grown to really like over the last few weeks. We’ve spoken a few times over text and she was really sweet and thankful and so nice to talk to. Ive noticed her look in my direction a few times before. I’ve only ever spoken to her once when she jumped into a conversation I was having with someone else though. I’d love to talk to her but right now our teacher has us in arranged seats and we’ve been nowhere near each other and won’t be until it changes after the holidays. There isn’t really time after our classes together to talk and I feel like it would be creepy to jump on her after class. One thing I did notice after out class once was that she was sat giggling with her friend who sometimes talks to me and actually got us 3 working together on something a few months ago. They were giggling and I think the friend was trying to encourage her to do something just before I walked past but neither of them were looking at me. I’m also really shy and awkward and awful at meeting new people so I would find it hard to ask that friend and talk a lot in person without knowing her well. I’ve written a list of everything I could think of that were signs she’s interested.

Signs over text:
- Initiated a few conversations.
- Constantly uses :)
- Came to me at midnight asking for help with class work. We were up until 2am helping each other.
- She tried relating to me on leaving our work last minute.
- She went to help me with something else I briefly brought up.
- Occasionally drops an X. I remember she accidentally did it to a guy in our class and she apologised to him.
- None of her replies are short unless it’s something that genuinely can’t be long
- Her replies are mostly within minutes
- She’s uses emojis like 😂😭😫 to me 
- Uses extra vowels a lot
- Types with capital letters sometimes
- She seems relatively easy to text
- Her texts are relatively long",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ro0la0/does_she_like_me_or_is_she_just_super_friendly/

From that point in time, I have made myself a better man, joined the military, learned discipline and respect, customs and courtesies, etc, and I still feel like something is missing.  


I don't know what it is truly, but I have tried to put myself out there over time, ever since my last relationship, which honestly scared me out of pursuing any further ones. I don't know if it's because I'm afraid I will be hurt again, or if they won't accept me for who I am, and what I have gone through but I have been unsuccessful as of now.  


Honestly, it's putting a bit of strain on how I look at myself, because when I'm ghosted, or removed randomly, it makes me wonder if there is something rather wrong with ME and not them, y'know?

63,ro0xjh,1640401072,Reflection on romantic relationships after watching 'It's A Wondsrful Life'.,"After going through years of insecurity because I never could generate a ""spark"" or ""romantic interest"" on dates. After spending time learning from POA and escalating quicker with women, I started focusing too much on physical aspects and not cultivating emotional/mental connections (my personal love language) my self esteem actually got worse off. I went on a date last week after spending time on myself and getting more confident, I decided I want something more than a physical connection. Well, I got the ""not feeling a romantic spark"" again. Spent this week a little down but I'm ok. Now I'm watching 'It's A Wonderful Life' with the fam and I'm seeing what it's like to have a partner that loves you for who you are and not ""a spark."" I'm seeing that that's what I need in my life, as I'd prefer to spend time getting to know someone and moving on the slower side, companionship- someone to build with that will have my back in the event I cant have sex anymore and vice versa

I want to get you guys' take because I notice a lot of single women lament about why they cant tie a guy down, getting ghosted after pseudo dating, etc. but they're sex life isn't lacking. And it seems like, to me, a lot of women now are more sex-focused. If that's what you want that's great, and I have the theory that is more-so how women fall in love. I could be wrong but i find it's much more often it's the women getting ghosted after consistent hookups/sex. I think if women took more time to find if a man was interested them for the people that they are, they'd find more success.

 I met this girl at a couple of BBQs over the summer during the semi finals and finals of European football championships. This was in a close friends’ garden which makes us mutual friends. He used to work with her but they still have a social group which includes my friends girlfriend who he lives with.

I only talked to her a little bit as we were busy watching the football, and after the final we left shortly after once we’d cleared up because England lost, plus we were in the garden and it was raining.

Obviously I developed a crush on her (I don’t often develop crushes) and it’s been over 5 months. I added her on Facebook a few weeks later but she didn’t respond so I then withdrew it. That makes this a far fetched approach. I’ve lost weight and get complimented by girls quite frequently but judging by Facebook don’t think she’s interested - or may have thought it was a but random.

I’m thinking of messaging her on Facebook to ask her out. Is it better to shoot my shot or wait to see if we ever cross paths again in the not too distant future (in spite of embarrassment over Facebook friend ignoring)?

But only one week later I saw that she is with that friend again and then it really hit me. Like f*cking never before. 

And today at Christmas eve I saw her again on IG stories that they already celebrating Christmas together. It is so freaking fucked up in my opinion to do that, especially that my ex was main priority in relationship was to not cheat on each other, which I totally understand and valued it. 

And only After single week she already with him. Why for us men's it starts only to hurt only after some time passed?

70,ro2a1i,1640406218,Mixed signals,"So i had been talking to (loosely)/ sexting this guy while my bf and I were on a break (i caught him cheating). We had reconnected after sexting each other for a while before i got together with said bf, then when we took a break, i reached out again. I never actually got to meet this guy in real life bc we were in different cities, but i ended up moving to the city he lives in for the summer. 

Ultimately we met up and had a great night at his house (talked a bit - hit it off, drank, hooked up), he was very into me. He still spoke to me after but i could tell he just wanted to keep the casual sexting relationship thing going, so i just went along as it was fun for me too. I end up seeing him again - we hook up almost immediately but he cums really fast (i was flattered, he was embarrassed). He was in and out my place in like 20min. He still spoke to me after but was different and clearly hesitant to see me in person again. I accepted that and let him go but then he reached out again. We sexted more and he would allude to wanting to see me but never tried to get to know me or make any kind of concrete plan. 

Fast forward a bit and i try to make things work with my bf who cheated. He ended up looking through my phone and finding out i had sexted this guy. He was upset and threatened to contact him. I didnt want to embarass myself or introduce drama into this poor guys life so i thought id tell him about the situation with my bf. I said we were on a break, and that i never told him bc we never really talked, it was clear he kept me at a distance and wanted something suuuuper casual anyway. He was very receptive to this and seemed like he didn’t care. I apologized for not being more transparent. Though he was surprised i had a bf he ultimately still wanted to sext me just the same as before. (I also secretly felt id leave my bf for this guy if he wasnt avoiding commitment as i was pretty into him)

I ultimately express to him that i really want to see him again, so when i was in the city next, we made it happen. I told him i broke up w my bf. After we each had a night out he invited me by at like 2am after his friends had left his place, i get there, we are both a little drunk and he introduces me to his best friend, and after he left, told me i should go to one of his hockey games, told me he thought he was in love w me(??) and then talked to me a but about his close family and proceeded to show me photos of his dad and niece whom he holds very close. I was drunk and had done half a tab of mdma and still felt that out of character considering how much of a distance he had kept me at up until that point. He also told me he has intimacy issues (??) which assume is why he keeps things so casual. Still a lot for me to digest. Anyway we hook up and it was great, and i sleep over. Cuddle all nigh. Wake up and have great *sober* sex. He messaged me a couple days later to check up on me, and i tried to initiate a convo or sext a couple tomes since and he has been kind but not entertained me the same as before. 

I know he clearly has his own set of issues, but i cant help but internalize his being so hot/cold. If he just wanted to hit and quit why see me multiple times? Why tell me things like you want to travel with me or show me pics of your fam and say you have intimacy issues?

71,ro2c8m,1640406463,"My advice/suggestion: DONT sleep around, even if you can, because most people find a high body count disgusting, here’s why","It suggests: 

1. You can’t form stable relationships 
2. You can’t form deep relationships 
3. You don’t care about investing in relationships 
4. You are unable to form deep emotional bonds with someone 
5. You are unable to commit to someone and stay loyal 
6. You are an emotionally undeveloped/superficial person with a lot of growing to do 


Note that I said SUGGESTS. It doesn’t matter if it applies to you or not, high quality partners will PERCEIVE it of you anyway, and most will be turned off massively by it. 

And then of course there are STD’s. gross. Whether you have them or not, many people will still feel disgusted by the knowledge you’ve been intimate with so many others. 



At the end of the day it’s your life, so what you want, I’m just adamantly suggesting you minimise sleeping around, because when the time comes to commit to a partner you want to spend the rest of your life with, you may find there are consequences to your careless past, and that most important person you love will turn away.

77,ro2yev,1640408846,Should I try again in a few months?,"So my wife moved out and served me divorce paperwork on the same day the week of Halloween this year after 10 years together and two young children. She told me in June she didn't love me anymore and it was all down hill from there. Cold blooded right? After working with a counselor and giving it time to sink in I've realized that I am not a terrible guy and that she has alot of emotional issues that come from an abusive mother that she never set boundaries for and never stood up for me while her mother treated me like dog shit. All this is to give some back story for myself and where I am at in life. Well around the start of November I went on Facebook and found this girl that I met last year while she was dating a friend of a friend. Her profile said single so I wanted to lay some early ground work like an idiot and personal messaged her some questions about my sons teeth since she is a dental something or another and we had already  talked in person the time we had met about them. I want to point out that my mental health provider I've been seeing through my divorce recommend i not try to date until i had my shit together which i clearly ignored like a fool. She was friendly and messaged me back and answered my questions and replied about how she remembered me and that she shares the same name with my children's mother/wife. I joked about that fact and thanked her for her time and made a joke about charging by the hour for consults because I'm smooth like that I guess. Anyways I waited a week or so and messaged her on Facebook again asking about what white strips she thought worked best. She hadn't messaged me back for a day or so so I messaged her again something short like ""you know the whiting kind."" Still no reply so I waited a few more days and replied something again like ""that whiten"" to try to keep up a cleaver image and attempt to make it look like I wanted an answer. After that still nothing after a couple days. So that weekend I went out with my friends and drank and did my thing and had a chance to ask the friend that was friends with the guy that used to date her. I showed him my messages and he reassured me that I wasn't getting creepy or anything, which by the way if I did let a guy know. So anyways he is aware of the divorce and supported me trying to ask her out. He shows me some trick that tells you when a person on Facebook reads your message (which is good because i guess ill have to know that kind of stuff for dating i suppose) which showed she had so I was super self conscious about my comming off as a creep. So the night progresses and I eventually end up back home in my bed. This of course leads to me opening up face book to see if she had responded as I assume an attractive women on a Saturday is too busy to check Facebook until late. So at 1am in the morning I decided It was a good idea to message her again basically telling her how my wife had left me and it had been long enough and I wanted to ask her out and that I'm a good guy and thought she was something special that the world needed more of or something along that lines. So I check for awhile and see that she has seen the message with the trick my friend showed me. No reply. I take a screen shot of what I sent her and sent it too my friend and he once again tells me what I sent isn't too much. The reply never came and I decided to move on with life.

     All this being said with the fact that at the time the divorce was only 6 weeks in or so and at this point isn't final, on said Facebook my profile says married and my profile pic is a picture of us and the kids still and also I'm still deeply in love with my soon to be ex wife and want it so badly to work out still since we only did 4 marriage counseling visits and there was still so much room for improvement. At this point I am now able to move forward and except that she wants the divorce and I have to keep moving forward. Sooooooo with all the being said do you guys think it would be a bad idea for me to attempt to reach out to dental chick again after everything in the divorce is final, I have emotionally moved on from my children's mother and updated Facebook to reflect that I am single? I am 31 with two kids under 5 and a soon to have ex-wife and she is 25/26 with no children or past marriage, could all that be the reason why she ghosted me to begin with I also ask myself. Did I already possibly scare her away anyways and just need to except it as a total loss?

78,ro30c8,1640409059,Getting Over Someone Off-Limits,"I met a girl recently that I have come to quite fancy.
(I, 21/She, 20)

 I've worked with father(let's call him Walter) for a few months, and he and I have built up a pretty good relationship. He unexpectedly called me his friend the other day, and he's always making remarks indicating our camaraderie, telling me often that I'm a ""good man"". He introduced me to his family, and particularly his daughter(let's call her Petra) shortly after he started working there. Granted, I did make an effort to help him during a time of need for him and his family.  Someone else ultimately was able to help him better than I, but I believe he appreciated my effort. 

I have had limited interactions with Petra during these few months, but she's recently starting working with me as well. I didn't pay much attention to her before, both out of respect for Walter and because I always assumed she was too young. Turns out she's only a year younger than me. The more we interacted these past few weeks, the more I have fallen for her. I'm not delusional, it's not love. That's ridiculous..but I can't get her out of my head. It turns out that we actually have some common interests. And she's been giving me a bunch of signals. 

I have put a significant amount of willpower into not falling for her. One of the semi-conscious strategies that I have employed, which hurts me the most is avoiding her where I can, ignoring her, which I know exactly how terrible that can feel, and this hurts me all the more. I want to be with her, and I know she, at least for a time, felt the same, at least wanting to get to know me better. Perhaps she does still, but I fear I have pushed her too far, which is perhaps for the better. The idea I had in mind, is that it would be easier to move on, if I could drive her to no longer feel for me..but I don't want her to hate me. I just feel that I am doing what needs to be done. Or I did, at least. I have a lot of respect for her father, for Walter. I do not want to ruin our relationship or cause issues at work by courting his daughter, who is simultaneously my coworker. My company has a pretty tightly-knit staff, and we're all close to the boss, particularly myself. I, again, do not wish to cause further issues for myself at work. Walter, may approve, considering his admiration of me, but if anything were to happen between Petra and I, there would likely be some issues at work. 

Nonetheless, I would like advice. 

How do I get over someone who I know, at least for a time, reciprocated feelings, someone who I perhaps could have been with, someone that I will see every day for the foreseeable future, and will, at times, be forced to work with? 

And ideally, don't tell me that there are ""other fish in the sea"", as I'm aware, and am comfortable being alone, particularly as my life situation does not currently support a relationship.

I thought wrong and not only does he see no wrong in this, his father has told him I’m wrong for not deleting all the males. I have limited my activity on there so I don’t see a point. He says I’m allowing men the opportunity to message me and hit on me….. 🥴. I don’t even post selfies anymore because I know it’ll bring men to my DM.

84,ro3lee,1640411413,How to end the cycle of being a rebound,"I need suggestions or advice. 

I tried dating apps and now I'm trying ""real life"" dating. I have come to the conclusion that most of the men I've attracted are all still hung up on their exes. My first experience at dating burned me badly as I was used as a rebound, and I've learned a lot since. But it seems that I'm a magnet to those that are still sad about their past relationships. I have stopped emotionally investing and consoling but still it doesn't seem to be enough. 

Have you shared the same experience as me? If yes, how did you go out of the cycle of being a free psychologist?  Don't get me wrong, I love helping people but I just don't want to be used and thrown away again and again.  

Thanks :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ro3lee/how_to_end_the_cycle_of_being_a_rebound/
85,ro3r69,1640412055,I want to get a loving girlfriend but I always get used by girls,"I always wanted a loving girlfriend but whenever I approach a girl. She use me for her favour, needs and leave me someone else. 
Recently I liked a girl but she only text/call me when she needed something and she ended up leaving me for someone else. I'm a good guy I never thought of any other girl infact when I was talking to her I barely talked to any other girl because I loved her but I always get end up like this. I'm sick of it. 
Should I accept that I'm never going to get a girl and love. If yes then How to make my mind. 
The girl I liked made me sad that girls are only gonna approach me when they need something. I'm always wanted best for that girl and always helped her in her hard times, I bought her MacBook for college because she broke her laptop, I wanted her to do best in College and a strong woman but she always took me for granted and she left me for a jerk who uses girls for sex and leave them whenever he finds someone better. I'm 22 and she is not a first girl that used me and lost my all of my hopes on girls and I guess I should stop looking for someone to love me. 
It seems girls don't want me for me and they talk to me because they knew that I'll never let them down.

87,ro3t5v,1640412255,I 22F feel humiliated by my friends (X) roommate (Y),"I have been friends with X for several years. We have been off and on in our friendship because of some of his actions. He would leave me every time he got a girlfriend, put me in countless awful situations, drinks 24/7 (has also driven drunk multiple time) smokes all the time and is extremely homophobic. X and Y literally just try to get at girls all day. I realized nowadays it is worse. Anyways, X hit me up about six months ago to be friends again because his girlfriend and him broke up. I don't know why I always forgive him I guess in my subconscious mind I think he will be different. He got a place with his friend, Y. Around thanksgiving I met Y and we got drunk and were supposed to meet X and his date at the bar but we got too drunk so decided to stay home. I ended up sleeping with him which is super unusual for me as I usually only have sex with people I am into. Everyday I have been there and I caught minor feelings for him. I told X I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep sleeping with him as I don't want to catch feelings. My friend told me not to Catch feelings because Y doesnt want a relationship. Of course, now I know he told Y about my private thoughts and I felt so hurt. I also found out that Y was telling my friend about the positions we did during sex and I felt so invaded. Y would text me all the time to hang with me and X. Y also asked me to come over and I declined and I told X about it and he basically told me I was Y's second choice to hit up. The big sign for me was when I had to park down the street from their place and it was pouring at like midnight, instead of making sure I got to my car okay or offering to walk with me he just said bye. I just started crying because it just hurt so bad because I just thought they would make sure I at least got home safe. When I hang with them, Y always tries to cuddle me, hold my hand, &amp; it just gives me mixed signals. Y talks about girls in front of me all the time and facetimes girls and it hurts so much. He talks about how he has had the best sex with this one girl and I feel as if he is just throwing it in my face. He has done this multiple times. I am doing everything in my power to ignore any phone calls.

I am almost done with college, have an internship, and have one or two good friends. I don't know why I bring myself to their level. All they do is stay home, get blacked out drunk, smoke and try to hit on girls. It is painful to hear about the girls Y talk about because it makes me feel like I just was not good enough. I guess I have such low self-esteem. My dad despises X, my mom does not like him or Y, my friends do not like him. They are not doing anything really with their life and only talk about themselves. I guess I just need to hear from other people because I do not know who to turn to.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ro3t5v/i_22f_feel_humiliated_by_my_friends_x_roommate_y/
88,ro3wdw,1640412639,I need advice :((,I'm (F25) dating this guy (27) since the last 6-8 months. We met on a dating app when we both were in different states didn't meet for the two months but spoke almost daily. Finally when we both were in the same city and started seeing each other. He was the first one to initiate the exclusivity 1/1.5 month into seeing each other. Everything has been great and he's a really sweet guy. We get along great and I feel like this is the most healthiest thing i have been in. We see each other 3-4 times a week and talk daily. I've asked him where he see this going around the two month mark and he said he likes me a lot and wants to see where it goes and doesn't want to put any pressure on it. His last relationship lasted almost a decade and he got cheated on so I understand his need to take things slow. But i feel like it's moving a little too slow? I haven't met his friends yet but i know that they know of me. He's going to move to another nearby city soon for a job and when I asked what happens then all he said was he'll visit regularly since his mother is really old and he will obviously need to be there to take care of her. So what i need advice on is if this thing is really going anywhere or are we just whiling out time because I can't figure out what he wants.,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ro3wdw/i_need_advice/

91,ro499q,1640414096,"I’m going to make getting a girlfriend one of my New Years Resolutions, I need some advice please.","So I’ve been trying to get a girlfriend since 2019 and have definitely learned a lot along the way and I think I know what I need to do now.

I’m going to go to places where I can easily find cute girls to talk to and ask them on dates.

Because at the moment I’m not really going to alot of places especially since I don’t drive and have a job yet.

Really the only places I’m going to right now is my house and my school, and about the school that I go to, I’m actually already graduated from high school but I’m attending a program that teaches me job skills, social skills, financial skills, and just life skills overall, and I’m taking that program at a high school and sure I could probably find some cute girls to talk to there but

1. There are only 2 girls in the program and I’m attracted to none of them, plus they would not be compatible with me.

And 2. Since it’s a high school, like 90% of the girls there are minors and I don’t want to be up on the sex offender list on accident.

However my teacher said that I’m eligible for going to a college to do some things so hey, maybe I’ll find myself a crap ton of choices there that I can talk to and ask on dates, I forgot what month that will happen though.

But yeah I won’t actually be signing up for a college, I’ll just be going to one everyday to do some stuff for the program that I’m taking but yeah.

Also I plan to get a job this upcoming year too but I’m going to work on getting my drivers license and a car first.

I think I will get a lot of chances to talk to girls this upcoming year and when I know that I have one, I’m 100% taking it.

So with all of that aside, I have 2 questions.

1. How would I know the perfect time to talk to a girl? because an issue that I’ve had in the past is that I could never find a good time to talk to a girl.

2. How exactly do I talk to her and ask her out without seeming desperate, pushy, clingy, and creepy?

And as a matter of fact I have 2 more questions.

1. Are there actually any GOOD dating apps/sites? because I absolutely loathe the ones that I’ve tried especially because I would get no matches plus I’ve heard other reviews from men and let’s just say that they aren’t good but they are probably right though.

2. For those of you women out there, what is your type? The reason why I’m asking is because I have brown hair, blue eyes, big feet, big hands, and definitely a big D.

I’m also 6,4 with a lean body.

I don’t really know my body or face shape though.

One last thing I will say though is that I do have a little bit of acne but it’s probably not going to be the first thing that you notice though.

Also when it comes to my personality I’m definitely a geek lol, I love action movies, super heroes, video games, Kaiju, memes etc.

The last things that I will say about my personality is if I do get a girlfriend sometime in which I’m hoping to this upcoming year, I will definitely plan dates often, lift the girl from her feet at times and definitely hold her like if I was Prince Charming😉, kiss a lot, play some video games together, go out to see movies, have sex, etc.

I could probably go on forever lol.

But yeah when it comes to my type, I really want someone who has some of the same interests that I do who will spend time with me often.

And when it comes to looks I’m kind of a variety person but I can really see myself being with a blond chick with blue eyes, slender body, decently sized breasts, small feet, small hands, and is alot shorter than I am but not under 5 feet.

So yeah when you can please look over my questions, answer them, and also overall give me your thoughts and also your best advice too please.

Also I get that I’m still really young and that I should try to focus a lot on other things too and I am, I’m working my ass off trying to achieve my dreams of being a game designer and along other things too, I’m hoping to take courses on programming and also digital art too.

Lastly just a side note, I have a foot fetish for some reason.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ro499q/im_going_to_make_getting_a_girlfriend_one_of_my/

Catching feelings is a mf when it’s not reciprocated back, especially when you REALLY like someone. Sucks even more when you both have this chemistry to where you’re almost convinced you could potentially get with them, only to be right back at square one.
