Met up for coffee Saturday, ended up talking for hours. She is really sweet, we get along great. We text a little Sunday, meet for dinner Monday. Afterward she discloses to me she has genital herpes. 

I feel so sick about this whole situation. I’m not someone who has sex early in a relationship, so it wouldn’t be any issue whatsoever for a while. But then it becomes an issue. From what I read, it’s really not that bad of a condition and is mostly controllable. Fairly low risk of getting it if you take precautions. It’s more the stigma of it, where to a lot of people you become a pariah.  So it seems like it’s not so bad actually getting it, it’s bad because other people think it's so bad.  But, the fact is people are afraid of it and it seriously impairs a person's ability to find relationships.  

I don’t know what to do. I’ve had some weird and downright bad experiences since I started dating, but this is honestly breaking my heart. Not because I’m magically in love with this woman I barely know, but because she was so scared to tell me. She tried to be strong and poised when she told me, but I know she feels so dirty and worthless and she’s terrified she’ll be alone her whole life now because of one rebound relationship.

The weird interrogation after a joke that they didn't get was so strange. I assumed that if I wasn't funny that people would recognize it as a joke... albit an unfunny one. I found it fascinating, I had never thought it possible.


Both came across as a bit tense and aggressive but to be honest most women do at first til they trust you although not to this extent. But the complete dead pannedness was really strange.

We both have 2 children, hers are older. I'm nearing the end of a marathon divorce proceeding, she's been a single mother for several years. We dated until early December, with her breaking it off (sort of) because my life situation as a dad with placement of his kids, and a marathon divorce proceeding, made her feel I wasn't ready. We still kept in touch though, we either of us initiating text conversations. In mid-March, we went on our first date together in months, and decided we'd give things another go.

Last Wednesday, she revealed to me by phone that she contracted herpes 2 years ago from a lying boyfriend, but has not had a flare up since. She was embarrassed and her voice trembled as she told me. I think she was afraid I'd run off, but I have feelings for her and the thought didn't cross my mind.  I told her I think highly of her and it would take more than something like this to scare me off. I'd just have to be careful when we have sex. It felt like a big step for her to tell me this, honestly. She's quite private and reserved.

This past weekend, she came to my place (albeit an hour or so late), we went to dinner (my treat), came back here and we had a blast. We made martinis, drank wine, played 3 games of pool with trash talk and kissing, before concluding with a great finish in bed (no intercourse, just foreplay). Here's the deal: I feel like I nice-guy'd myself into the lower-hand in the relationship and killed some attraction between Saturday and tonight.

First off, before she arrived, I asked what she was in the mood for, for food. Second, I got her a card congratulating her on her new house she got in February--writing I'm here if she needs any advice or help, as someone who has been a homeowner for a long time. Third, I lost to her in pool. Fourth, when we kissed goodbye next morning, I told her she's amazing. Fifth, I texted her to make sure she got home alright a couple of hours later (her drive is about 25 min). What troubles me is, Sunday night, Monday and today, I was the one to initiate the text conversations. I heard nothing from her Tuesday after I posted on FB a video of my son's complete game in his first ever LL start. I know she was on FB a few times after the post went up. Not a ""like"" or a text. 

Do you think I started to bury myself with the ""nice guy"" actions I took, or am I just over-thinking because she is, by far, the sexiest, wittiest, and most fun girl I've ever been with?

The relationship is not without its issues (different communication styles, I feel like I take on all the emotional work, ED issues that we’re working on), but nothing insurmountable. I feel great when I’m with him- at peace, loved, happy. But when I’m not with him, the relationship feels like a lot of work. 

10 months ago, I was over 1.5 years out from filing for divorce, the pandemic looked almost over, and life felt full and joyful. Now, I’m “balancing” being a mom/teacher/daycare with a new, intense job. My kiddo (7 yo) is struggling with clinical anxiety. My ex is stirring up trouble and using our daughter as a pawn.  I feel like I’m out of energy long before I get to being part of a relationship, let alone doing any of the hobbies (or chores) that make life so much more livable. I do see a therapist, but need to find a better fit. 

Part of me wants to batten down the hatches, dump the guy, and just focus on kiddo, work, and self. But every time I make up my mind to break it off, another part of me points to the value and love and support in this relationship, an end to the pandemic in sight, and my tendency to push people away when I need them most. And another part of me is whispering that I stayed in my last (violently abusive) relationship for at least 18 years too long and I’m doing the same thing here, that I don’t need people, and that life is safe and sane and secure only when it’s just my daughter and me.

During a brief period i activated Tinder earlier this year, around January IIRC.  I only made one match, but i was optimistic about them.  Male, not precisely my type - short hair while i prefer long, only a couple tattoos, but a decent punk-light aesthetic and a great smile and charisma, artist and teacher while i prefer STEM types, openly spiritual while i was raised without religion so i don't grok it very well. Nothing major, a few areas of concern but i figured the things we had in common - love of neonorse music, nerdy subcultures, etc, were enough to at least get a conversation going.  And we did chat for about 2 weeks, during which time we moved from Tinder to text, but being unvaccinated, we couldn't meet in person.  So i texted him after about 3 weeks of increasingly tepid texts, i hope respectfully, ""I think you're interesting and we have a ton in common, but i'm not feeling a spark.  Maybe post lockdown this might have legs, but text might not be the best medium to get to know each other."" And he replied, ""Ok cool.  Take care.""

So, in 12 days i WILL be fully antibodied up, and if he is too, we could meet in person.  If you were him and received a text with an invite to hang out in person because now it's safe, would you be offended or hurt or annoyed? I fully accept his right to say no, i'm more worried that extending the invite to begin with, would be unacceptable.

We basically grew up together. And before her I was pretty much self raised and forced to be an adult at an early age. Anyways enough of a back story. So here is my issue. I am fully divorced, yay!!! And have been on my own with full custody of my daughter. Now I haven’t had my own room in two decades and before it was pretty much just been a basic plain room. 

So anyways, I got the room to myself when my ex-wife ran away. And I went kind of crazy. I decorated it the way I wanted to. With stuff I like. So My daughter who comes to my room to use my apple Tv to watch her K-dramas recently said that my room does not look like an adult room. And she added that if I ever get a girlfriend she will think I am immature. I laughed, because I am mature in the sense that I handle my bills, work full time and take care of my family without anyones help. But technically I am still just in my enjoying life stage, not trying to be serious about life. So in my room I have several framed movie posters, some of my Funko Pop collection, my katanas, My TV, A big shoe rack, my wine, my guitar and my Archery collection.

So I have two questions. One is do women care what a mans room looks like? If I have my own place, and it is clean, does it matter how it is decorated?  

And second how should a newly single person decorate their room?

I’m a 42 year old woman who’s been married once and has no children, if you need a frame of reference for this post.

I decided to go back on one lousy dating app after my last relationship ended at the end of last year. That relationship was a tough one to get over, but I won’t get into that here because that’s not the point of this post. I may still have some things to work through regarding that relationship, but I’m not looking to get married tomorrow, and I figured some taking-it-slow dating couldn’t be too terrible. Yikes, I might have been wrong about that. Allow me to share...

I’m just going to skip talking about the annoying “hi” or “gm” messages to which I don’t even usually respond. I figure if you can’t put more effort into a first message than an abbreviation for good morning, I’m not guessing you’re gonna bend over backwards getting me off if we ever even make it to sex, so I’m already out. And I’m not going to get into the open relationship people looking for a third or an extra girlfriend or whatever. If that works for y’all, mazel tov, but it’s not my thing. The younger men, sorry, I’m not here to be your Mrs. Robinson. The older guys, ehhh I’m not ready to be a grandma to your kids’ kids yet, and the scammers pretending to be in the “USA Army”, well I come from a military family, so you’ve got the wrong one if you think I’m believing all that. So let’s get down to the actual conversations and/or dates, shall we?

1. The first guy I went out with was ok, but he was kind of gruff and not the most polite person, he definitely lied about his height because I think I was taller than him, and I’m 5’4, and when he mansplained me after the second date, I completely checked out. Thank God we only went out twice and got nowhere close to sex.

2. One guy I was having some decent conversations with, but it just fizzled out. I’m not sure why and figure he was talking to a few people and maybe started dating someone. Bummer, but I’ll live.

3. One guy I had some alright conversation with, nothing to write home about, but he was like an old man, set in his ways and kind of negative about a lot of things. He sent a lot of wink face emojis or just “lol”, it got kind of juvenile and annoying, and I was over it. He also was a bit of a drive away, and I can only get so enthusiastic about someone not in my area.

4. One guy who also wasn’t too close to my area seemed to get annoyed because I couldn’t meet up right away. Maybe I didn’t express myself well in this particular scenario, I’m not totally sure, so maybe it was my bad there. The point with this one is that unless we are just going for a quick meet-and-greet date, I’d kind of like to know a bit more about someone first. And even then, quite honestly, I can save myself the trouble of even the quick date if I chat enough with someone to know I’m not interested. Why do I need to put on a little makeup, straighten my hair, and drive 20 minutes to find out I’m not feeling it if I can find out with a bit more messaging?

5. One guy who wrote perfectly and was really nice to chat with, and then I found out that he had some kids he didn’t live near and wasn’t really helping raise. I can’t with that. On a superficial note, his idea of getting ready for church with his mother on Easter Sunday was wrinkled jeans that looked previously worn/dirty, and a jacket that was too big. I’m a Jewish girl from the Bible Belt who has been to church with friends plenty of times, and I know what a lot of y’all wear there, I believe in dressing appropriately for certain events, so geez Louise, no. The kid thing was the nail in the coffin though over and above anything else.

6. One guy who I cancelled on for a first meeting because well, he got on my nerves. Sue me. He knew nothing about me (again, more messaging might have been better for me personally), yet he told me that he was interested so many times that you know what happened? That’s right my friends, I was no longer interested! You know very little about me but are interested? Sounds like you ain’t picky and might just be looking for a warm body. How flattering.

7. One guy who seemed like an all around good catch, we met for a quick coffee, and sadly, he was quite feminine. I don’t care what people do, who they love, I support anything that makes people happy and doesn’t hurt anyone else, but I’m not personally physically attracted to men who have feminine qualities, not to mention he was pretty small (I’m slender), so he made me feel kind of like a whale next to him. He was definitely also fresh out of a divorce, and it was kind of cliche. He did not seem to relate well to anyone other than 9-5 types with kids, he had lived in bigger cities, I’m not a city girl, and he just didn’t get me I don’t think. Not a bad guy, just maybe not the guy for me. I could be friends with him, but nothing else.

8. And for the coup de grâce, we have the date I went on today. I can appreciate a southern gentleman who works hard if he’s well-rounded. This guy didn’t wear a mask, said he would never get a vaccine from the government (I’m waiting for my second dose), he thinks one of the vaccines makes people sterile (huh?), and he thinks he can’t get COVID because of his blood type. When the server asked if I wanted lemon for my iced tea, I said yes, but she forgot it. He told her I wanted it without me mentioning it (it wasn’t a big deal, and I would not have asked for it), he wasn’t that friendly to her, and I don’t think he tipped even 20%. As someone who tips well, that is a big no for me. Especially because I think she gave him his beer on the house since he didn’t like one part of his entree. I think I also caught him motion at her one time. Not like a come here motion, but a kind of hand wave of some sort. Oh and he was an interrupter. Rude, rude, rude. Ok, we are done here.

It was a really odd relationship. One like I’ve never had before. We also work together,  live about 45 min apart as well. I’m 42 and she is 29. So there’s a little background. Anyways... We started off normal for the first month or so. Sex a few times a week. Talking all the time etc etc. We work 2 days one week and 5 the next. Rotating every other week. 
     So I have been in many relationships. Was also married for 7 years. I know better than to fall hard and fast. Or at least know better than to show my hand so quickly if I do. But I could not help it with this girl. Won’t go on and on, but I’ve never found as many qualities that attract me in one single woman as I have in her. We communicated about where we wanted to be. We both agreed that this was monogamous. And I agreed to take it slow. Which is what she asked for from me. But I didn’t. And I basically pushed her away. She started responding less and less to my texts. Wouldn’t look at me at work. Wouldn’t smile etc. And yes, this hurt. I knew what was wrong, but at this point I just couldn’t let go. And the less I tried to be around (because I knew she needed a break or some distance) the less time we spent and harder it got for me. But she would go hang with her friends all the time and when it came time for us to hang, we would just stay at her house once or twice a week at night. She didn’t really take the time to get to know me as a person either. I just got so many mixed emotions from her. We talked several times and agreed that we’d still hang and set aside at least one night a week to stay together. But we would slow down. Basically me slow down. Also, we both have kids. Me, full time. She splits time with her ex. There’s a ton more to this, but I’m not gonna bore ya’ll. But we went from talking many times a day, and telling each other good night and good morning, to just small talk maybe 2-3 times a day. She stopped saying goodnight and it felt like I was the only one putting ANY effort into it. So it finally got to the point where I got really pissed at her for ignoring me and snapped and just unloaded all of my frustrations. The final straw was that she told me she was too tired to do our weekly night together. This is after she had been at the beach for 5 days with her friends. 
So after I snapped we had it out and both said we were done. I didn’t want it to end on an ugly note, so I went and talked to her about everything at her house. I told her that I really didn’t want things to be over, but I couldn’t do what we were doing anymore. I just needed more. Even a little. We agreed to try and be friends and not make things weird at work. Because it was really weird for a minute. So I got all my stuff and went home. But before leaving she said maybe if we got through this and things were ok, that we could possibly start hanging out again. But this time would have to take things slow from the start. 
I am really crushed Bc I knkw what I could have done in the beginning to prevent all this. Just laying back a little. I just screwed up. 
Bottom line.... any advice on how to go about handling this? I REALLY feel like if she knew me like she should then she would definitely fall for me. She says she just didn’t feel that spark, but that’s because we just never really got going. And little things like we kiss differently so it would be awkward while having sex. I should have fixed that by bringing it up and working on a way to make that work but I didn’t. I feel like kissing good is a very important factor in relationships. At least the sexual part. So what should I do to try and win her back? Please no negative shit. Ya’ll all know you’ve felt like this before. Obviously she doesn’t feel the same for me, but I KNOW if I had just a legit opportunity, I could win her over. If she went into it with totally open mind and just let go and let things happen without just looking at the negatives all the time.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,45846,public,self,Just broke up,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/mwpr1f/just_broke_up/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,b50cbf0c-3935-11e9-a609-0e217b8f2048,Seeking Advice,,,,

Me - early 40's, him - the same. 

I am thinking of asking him: ""If the opportunity presented itself right now - if you met someone that was interesting to you - would you go out on a date with her?""

If he says yes, then, I would say - ""Would you like to go with me to X.""

I feel a 100% confident that if there's no interest on his end, things will not be weird, at least, not for long. We are on the same co-ed sports team, but have now known him long enough to feel that he would definitely handle the situation with discretion and class.

He broke up with his live-in girlfriend (of 7 years) since January. I understand that a 7 year-relationship, even if it was on-and-off (he implied as much) is still very significant. Who knows, maybe they'll even get back together. However, I am clear that I am interested in getting to know him beyond just friends and feel like I should act sooner rather than later. I want to be careful, but I also want to be brave. I'm ultimately interested in something long-term, but for right now, I'd just like to see if there's a there there.

He asked me once whether I was interested in anyone in our sports league. He has asked me to hang out after games and mentioned on several occasions that we should hang out, but has never asked me to hang out with him on any specific day or time, but often pays for my drinks. He has mentioned several times specifically to me that it's good to see me. However, at some point it seemed like he was trying to set me up with someone else on league, too. He could be hesitant since he is the captain of our team, but he might just be friendly. All of this is neither here nor there. He for sure likes me, but I'm just not sure if he does ""in that way.""

My problem is...I can’t seem to find a quality man (has a job, can afford vacation, has his own car) to date. 
Someone told me men of higher value (not my words) absofuckinglutely won’t date a bigger girl. I’m not like my 600lb life or anything, I’m just not skinny. 
Am I destined to be alone forever? The best matches I get are 20 somethings who want to be with an “older woman” or a bunch of losers who want to be FWB but don’t know what the F stands for.

I was fishing and in addition to the locals there was a young (late 20's ?) Woman there. I could tell she was new to fishing but I didn't want to invade her personal space so I didn't make any advances.Besides, when I see a woman the last thing I'm gonna think is 'she wants me to come talk to her'.

At some point she got a tangle and I helped her free her line up. A short while later she asked me how to set up a trolley rig. I walked her through it , showing and explaining all the steps to her. Then I helped her cast out her line .not trying to make her sound inept, she was far from it. But when your not used to casting out 10 oz weights it can take a little practice. While waiting for her bait to swim out we chatted. We ended up standing there talking for almost 3 hours.

My friends were pressuring me to ask for her phone number, but I'm a little older than them and don't assume that any woman that talks to me is 'interested'.

But then we got onto the topic of targeting snakeheads (a fish).This is a fish i have never targeted or cought.She seemed very excited to share her experience. I suggested that maybe at some point she could teach me. Then she said that was a good idea and offered her phone number.

About an hour later my friends and I were packing up and she too was getting ready to leave. I was hoping to walk with her to the parking lot. But she left before my friends got packed up.

As we were loading the truck she came running over to give me a couple lures that we had talked about earlier. We all said out goodbyes and she said she would be fishing tomorrow and would see us there. More like a casual 'see you if your there ' than a planned date.

 When I got home I texted her that it was nice to meet her and I look forward to hanging out with her again.

I had planned on going fishing today , primarily to see her again. But when I woke up this morning I was aching too bad. I did text her asking what time she was going fishing, but got no response. I called about the time people usually pack up. Intending to ask if she went fishing and how it went but got no response. 

So at this point I'm not sure what to think. I'm gonna wait a couple days and try again. The one thing I'm not going to do is to make any assumptions. She might be only interested in me as a fishing companion.

He introduced me to his 5 year old daughter a month later and we went on a 2-week cross country trip—in a moving truck in late August!

We said ‘I love yous’ in November and deleted our dating apps together. We’ve discussed kids and I’m off birth control; he has said he wants to have a future with me and raise he daughter with me too. He shared that his dad asked if he was happy with me and he said yes.

And we recently spent a week for spring break in NYC with his kid; met the ex briefly as we returned the 5 year old. 

So after all this, is it weird I haven’t met his parents (whom he lives with because he takes care of them)? Or his twin brother and closest friends who are all local?  

Yes, I know COVID has made meeting hard but I’m responsible and tested negative more than once. I just got vaccine #2 and his parents have also been vaccinated.

When his dad was very sick, I offered to drop by and help out, or even drop off food and he refused. He says his mom is embarrassed of dad’s condition and not being himself.

I’ve introduced him to my best and closest friends (in my pod) and even spent my recent birthday with him plus my closest friends. I invited his twin and friends to the outing on a 630 acre winery but I don’t think he ever asked.

He said his BFF and college roommate invited him and his brother to visit this weekend (in my hometown, not too far from my parents) and said he wanted to see me on Sunday after he came back. 

Of course I want him to see his friends. They’re important but I’m also thoughtful to include and connect people who are important in my life.

I thought it was a guys only weekend but after I texted him to see how he was doing, he sends me a photo showing his twin’s and BFF’s wives there at the house “party.”

I feel left out. I get he hasn’t seen his friend for more than a year (they text every day) but is it weird that he didn’t invite me? He always says I’m too good for him, or that he’s not good enough for me; worried he’ll embarrass me in front of my friends. Then why does it feel like he wants to keep me separate from them?

I asked him about it in February and he said I’m the best, most beautiful, kind and smart woman that he’s proud to be with and that I would meet them soon. Nothing yet.

Note: one thing that happened was on my birthday last weekend, he Facetimed his daughter so she could sing me happy birthday. As she did, a message from “So and so HINGE” flashed on his phone. I didn’t say anything immediately but I was uncomfortable since my friends were just rolling up for our wine tasting. He noticed and I said just wonder who that was. On our way home, he said it was a woman he had talked to but never got anywhere with. It turns out his new hire’s girlfriend is best friends with that girl, and that she was messaging him because she and the gf wanted to surprise the employee at work this past Wednesday. They needed my bf to get them access to the building. I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt.

 building a career and raising 3 kids.  My husband was basically a second caretaker for the kids and nothing more to me.  I think we were incompatible from the start, and if I'm being honest, I think saw a great dad and childcare provider in him, someone who would allow me to continue in my career while deferring a lot of the childcare to him.  

About 10 years ago I saw how empty my life was and started to search for my happiness.  It's been a long, slow road, but i have finally separated from my husband and am starting a life on my own.  I own a duplex with my husband, and as a first step we have each taken a flat to live on our own.  It isn't much but it's a start.

I have literally one (1) friend who I can count on to tell me the truth.  Other than that, I spend my time working in my high pressure job or doing chores in the house.  Long story short, I am desperate for some companionship of the opposite sex, but I am terrified of the dating apps.

I don't want to rate myself, but I would call myself fit and cute for 59.  People say I've taken good care of myself relative to my late 50s peers. 

I would like to work in my job for a few more years and then retire somewhere warm, hopefully with someone nice to share it with.  Thankfully I have the means to do what I want in  retirement.

I feel like my life is at a crossroads.  Either accept eternal singlehood and get on my with my life, meager as it is, and learn to live in solitude.

OR

Build my confidence/thick skin/etc. and get on the dating apps to see what I can find.   

I am one of those quiet intellectual types who loves a witty conversation covering wide ranging topics, and I am pretty unsure I'll find what I am looking for on the dating apps.

I'm planning on moving forward in late spring and am considering hiring someone to help me put together my profile, take photos, etc.  Is this just a colossal waste of time that will only result in unhappiness?  If i base it on what I read on reddit, dating late in life is tough.  Would love your input.

Last year I was in a really bad place when I met this guy who was devastatingly handsome. I knew he was a player and he also lets on a lot of details about his dating life which normally is a major red flag for me (including sleeping with other girls while having a girlfriend) At the time I wasn’t really looking for a relationship at the time and saw him merely as a hook up / casual relationship person so the red flags didn’t bother me. Within 3 months the whirl wind of lust / sex ended for me. I decided I needed to stop seeing him before I got too involved. I started distancing myself and went no contact for a while. No matter how long I stopped texting him, he would somehow get back in touch with me via text. Initially I told myself that there was no reason to be rude and we could be friends. I would meet him for dinner etc but made it clear it wasn’t going to end up with us having sex ever again. He seemed happy to stay in touch even without sex. When I asked him explicitly why. He told me “sex is easy to get, but not everyone is worth keeping in touch with” ( English is not his first language, I got the gist of it as being I was worth keeping as a friend). After that I thought it would be easy just to stay friends but the regular texting and the meeting up regularly started getting to me. Although he has a ton of red flags , I find myself thinking about him romantically, I tried dating other guys but still inadvertently started comparing others to him. 
He tells me he has a rotation of 5 girls he sees regularly. I don’t see him giving that up for me so I don’t see a point talking to him about my feelings since I doubt he will say what I want to hear and the likelihood of being hurt inadvertently is very high. To date, we have known each other for close to a year, we even go to the same gym (I got the contact from him) . It feels much harder to go no contact suddenly without feeling more of a sense of loss. Should I take a chance and tell him how I feel?

We separated 2 years ago, and not long after I met my BF and we really hit it off. He was aware of my relationship with my ex and my feelings for him being platonic. We moved in together 1 year ago. I had two cats with my ex, both who I love dearly, but one clearly liked him better, so I took one and left the other. I still miss her greatly, and being great friends I would go over on weekends to visit, occasionally bringing my other cat, and boyfriend when he was up for it (we're both chronically ill). Last summer we had an issue where he felt I was going over too often and expecting him to go over too often. I didn't understand because I thought they liked each other and he knew I had totally platonic feelings for my ex. Over the winter the visits were less frequent, but since spring is coming I've wanted to go hang with my cat in the backyard and visit more. I hadn't been for over a month and then went over a few weekends in a row, and I guess this is an issue.

Full disclosure: I have difficulties with social cues and norms and have from a young age, relating a lot to autistic posts on the matter, and sometimes I don't see things clearly as others do, which is why I'm asking here if this is not okay.

Talking to my BF about it last night, I somewhat understand how it would upset him. I run errands on weekends when I'm not working after appointments and spend a few hours there with my cat on one day. My BF is more of a homebody though and doesn't always want to come, and I get lost shopping with a few hours passing by in the blink of an eye, so I'm not spending my full weekend with him, and as I miss him, I know he misses me too.

So I need to know, in your opinions, what is a reasonable frequency to visit my cat? I know she's not a human, but I feel a great deal for her. I've had her 8 years. I can go when my ex isn't there, but I appreciate being able to see him occasionally. So, what is appropriate? My BF doesn't like how intertwined our lives are still (we still are both on the mortgage), but honestly he feels like just a good friend. I've never looked at him like a lover, and that's why we shouldn't have been married. At the same time, I was with him almost 20 years, and I'm still trying to learn how to live a different life. How long does it take to make this change?

I am lost. I love my BF so much and I don't want him to feel like I'd rather be elsewhere, but I also love my fur baby. Our families are all so happy we are friends, and I care about him a lot, but I also very much care about my BF. I feel so torn, and I don't know if I'm doing a bad thing.

I'm 40 he's in his mid 30's. We're both single. I've been single two years, he got out of a serious LTR about a year and a half ago... I suspect he's still a little hung up on her. We've worked at the same place, but different departments, for the better half of a decade. I've always had a low key crush on him. He's flirted with me quite a bit in the last year or so.

We hooked up once about a month and a half before the new year, then he ghosted me (didn't respond to a text I sent a week after the hookup. Honestly, was just trying to start up a conversation, though we never texted before the hookup.) So... I avoided him for a couple weeks, and then he started blowing hot again. I had been casually seeing someone in the interim between the first hookup so I blew him off a little, until a couple months ago when that fizzled out, then I reciprocated. We hooked up a few more times over the course of 3 weeks, and then one night I was quite inebriated and asked some prodding questions.

He made it clear he's not looking for anything serious, but that he liked me more than a friend and felt close to me.

The sex was some of the best I've ever had, the cuddling intense and wonderful, I was high as a kite for a full day after seeing him.

Then the reality of the fact that his actions say he's not as into me as I would like would crash down on me, and my anxiety went through the roof.

The last time I stayed with him, I said to him I was thinking of ending things because I was not feeling as if I was being pursued in the way I like... and he implied that *he* felt like *I* was the one pursuing *him*, which made me leap out of bed (for whatever reason, I felt insulted), begin to get dressed, and mutter that he wouldn't have to worry about me ""pursuing"" him again. He got up and apologized and said that the way it sounded wasn't what he meant, that he had been pursuing me too, and he looked pained. We quickly switched topics and discussed lighter things before I left (it was morning) and he seemed to be trying to get me to stay longer. I felt uncomfortable but I think I hid it well.

Since then I've done nothing to try and seem interested in chatting more at work than is polite and professional. He seemed to try and strike up conversation for a few weeks, but now he mostly ignores me, two months later.

I hate this. I like this guy. I want to be with him. I don't know how to change this. I know he's terrible for me... the way I feel so infatuated with him sets off sirens in my gut.

if you prefer to listen. Let me know what you think about the message down here or preferably in the youtube comments.

**Introduction**

In the manosphere, the concept of ""You are the prize"" is often advocated for men who want to find success in many aspects of life, whether that is in dating, in social relationship or in a career. It is usually prescribed to men who are victims of a conditioning mindset, always prioritizing others needs and feelings before his own, which is often the cause of men perpetual exhibition of undesirable behaviours such as chasing and pedestalizing women that we see in the modern world today. In many sense, the prize mentality sets the foundation for an alternative and arguably, a better way of thinking for men about his roles within the external world, to get what he wants, and to achieve what he desires

**The Prize Mentality**

""Being the prize"", the modern man can think differently and have higher regards for himself, and by doing so, in theory, he is expected to translate those thoughts and beliefs into the manifestation of characteristics and actions that are psychologically perceived as more superior and of higher quality. This display of great self-esteem becomes his way of communicating to others, both on a conscious and subconscious level, giving a great impression of who he may be and what he might capable of. That is a powerful way of influencing how people view and treat you, as a prize that glows with greatness and potential. as a prize that demands respect and admiration. That is a prize to be competed for and chased after by others.

**Limitation of The Prize Mentality**

This is in accordance with law 34 in the 48th law of power: Be Royal in Your Own Fashion: Act Like a King to Be Treated Like One. ""You are the prize/I am the prize"" is a powerful mindset, and its effect is as real and undeniable by most. However, like many other guidances within the manosphere, the prize mentality is only advised as a tool, and it being a tool will require you to understand and more importantly, be skilful with it, that is to know its potential and its limitations. Knowing how to use a hammer does not make you a great builder, and likewise, having ""the prize"" mentality does not actually make you the prize, and with it failing to critically and objectively address if you are actually the prize or not is one of the biggest limitations that the advocate of the prize mentality experiences among men.

**Are You Really The Prize?**

Ask yourself the question: Are you really the prize? Perhaps in the short term, it does not matter, but for most men out there, the ability to give a definite answer will likely determine if they can truly internalize such a powerful mindset. Acting like the prize while not actually being the prize is no different than living in delusion, and while that does not defy its utility, the internalization process becomes a life long struggle when your set of beliefs and behaviours are backed up by nothing that reflects your true reality. Thinking ""You are the prize"" when you truly and deeply believe that you are not will either send you a ticket straight back to your miserable self or keep you in a state of delusional, never getting anywhere far or achieving anything meaningful.

**The Truth About The Prize Mentality**

No amount of repetition of ""You are the prize"" will make you the prize. No amount of encouragement of ""You are the prize"" from others will make you the prize. No amount of ""fake it til you make it"" will actually make you the prize. As a man living in a modern and feminized world, adopting something that is at the core of the way women think and believes is a disaster to a man's life and his success. Yes, unfairly, it works for women for many reasons, but not without consequences of course, yet this difference between how a man and a woman get to becomes the prize is the true harsh reality that most men can not comprehend nor accept coming into the space of the manosphere.

As a man, you can not just be the prize. You have to become the prize. To have the prize mentality embedded within you, to act like a prize, to think like a prize, to behave like a prize, consistently, continuously across all situations and over a period of a lifetime, you have to actually build yourself to a point where you are reinforced with progress and success to confidently believe that you are, always have been or can potentially become the prize. Just like how respect is earned and not given. The prize is never given to you. You have to go and chase it. You have to earn it. You have to become it. There is no shortcut for men to achieve what he wants, what he puts in life is what he gets.

**Conclusion**

If you don't want to put in the work, settle for mediocrity. If you don't want to be exceptional, settle for conformity. If you don't want to become great, settle for the lesser prize.

K for background I've always loved house, dance, edm, disco, jungle, etc going back to the 1990s. Since 2017 I've been listening to a more underground style of EDM called Future Funk/ Vaporwave. It's very experimental ala Avalanches meets Ceronne with J pop. 

My apprehension is that FF/WV fans tend to be young. Like my daughters (20s) age range. But the music is upbeat, fun and doesn't come off as the same old as Danny Tenaglia and other older DJs seem repetitive or old in their sound (IMHO). And I'm hooked.

I’ve had a handful of short-term relationships and one longer, more serious one that broke my heart pretty badly when it ended. Over the years, I’ve gone on quite a few first dates and I’ve found - especially since my big heartbreak - that I very rarely develop enough interest in someone to go on a second date. 

My dates aren’t bad. In fact, most of them are fun and I enjoy the company and conversation, but I walk away without any strong desire to see the person again, even though we had a good time for the 2-3 hours that we spent together (dinner/drinks). If I feel chemistry on the first date, I will go on a second, but at that point I’m still largely in the “feeling it out” stage to determine if I’m truly interested in someone romantically and I feel like the guy almost always interprets a second date as a sign that there is romantic interest and tries to progress things with a kiss, which totally kills the vibe for me because I like some desire to build before kissing. 

I’m guessing I’m in the minority here and I don’t know if this demisexuality or asexuality or just a personal preference, but it’s really making it hard for me to pursue a relationship. Pre-heartbreak, I developed romantic interest for people much more easily, so maybe I just have major walls up, but it’s been 3 years since that breakup and I’m definitely over the guy, so it’s frustrating to think that it might still be affecting me and impacting my ability to connect with someone new.
