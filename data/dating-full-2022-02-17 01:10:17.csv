For 5 years I have had a crush on this girl at my school. And I don't know what to do about it anymore. I think she likes me back, but I'm not sure if the signs are ""right"". 

**Some** signs (I guess) that happened this year:

\- She used to come to my class I had with her friends, even though she wasn't even enrolled into the class. She came in multiple times to talk to them, and I remember a time when she asked them if they ""liked her outfit"". Which I thought was implicitly meant for me (she was always right next to me when talking). After awhile though she stopped coming. Maybe because I never started a conversation with her, or because I simply leave half of the time. This is because I get anxiety when she's around, like my heart starts racing. So I just try play it off cool however, by looking ""uninterested"", since I do not want to get embarrassed.

\- I noticed quite recently, that whenever I come into her classrooms, she's the first to raise her hand and ask questions. And to me, I think it's quite an outlier? Because there was nothing being taught when I was around. And I feel like it's just her trying to catch my attention. And it's something I would do too.

\- I can feel that she's watching me whenever I walk by or when I'm in a room with her, like those quick glances towards me. I can't describe it well enough, but for some reason I have this strong feeling.

\- There was one time in the beginning of the school year, where I'm 90% sure she waved to me. I have a huge problem where I don't wave back to girls. Since I always feel like it's directed at their friends (who in my mind are behind me, when in reality they are not).

(One thing I forgot to mention is that we are not in any of the same classes, but I see her almost everyday.)

At this point I don't know what to do anymore. Should I try striking a conversation with her? And If I do how? I always try to act ""cool"" around her, by looking uninterested.

Seemed like such a genuine guy. I thought I had maybe found the one. But I think he maybe love bombed me a bit. I think we both got wrapped up in the potential of a fantasy situation.

He was planning to come visit me last month and it ended up not happening. He even told me that he took time off of work to plan for this. But he ended up ditching and didn’t try to reschedule. I think he is a bit lazy and that is probably why he’s not married or in a relationship at his age. Because he’s a very interesting guy, pretty charming, he wants kids and a wife. Nothing seems to be wrong with him. I think he just has trouble with commitment and likes to self isolate. Once things started to get real he stopped being so responsive to me. He stopped talking to me about the future. That entire week he’d leave me on read for hours, only giving one word responses most of the time. Whenever I tried to nail down specific dates, he’d be very vague. Once he had to go back to work and the discussed visiting period was over, he was more responsive.

Met through a mutual friend, didn't really start shooting my shot till the second time seeing her and didn't start talking until the third time which was about a week or two ago.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, we're still in the talking stages but we've made it clear that we like each other and that maybe we'll become a thing. She wants to take things slow, and so do I but it's hard when she sometimes does and says stuff that are far from slow.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, we had a big argument last week because her old FWB was texting her and she was replying. They met two months ago on her bday and she said he slid up on her DM's a month later and that's when they started being friends and hooking up every once in a while. I was upset she was still talking to him, maybe unreasonably because we did just start talking, and after some arguing she removed him and blocked him (which I realize might've been a little bit much for me to ask). But he did suggest something sexual even if it was only brief and jokingly, she did not entertain that and instead changed the subject.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, it came up again today because after that I was being a little insecure and questioning her. A female friend of mine drunkenly came up to me when we first started talking and warned me that she heard some stuff, but if I'm being honest I don't neccesarly have the highest confidence in that friends opinion and my other friends are good friends with her, so it only left a small linger of doubt.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, today when we're talking about what are we and stuff she says she doesn't like that I tried telling her who she can be friends with and to cut him off, that she still wants to be friends with him but with boundaries. Because he was a friend first and foremost. I told her that bothered me and she seemed to back off but my question, that I don't even want to ask her because I don't want to bring it up again so soon if ever is why this one month relationship, no matter what it was first is so important to fight for when she says she likes me and wants something with me. Should I not be worried that the idea of still talking to someone she met a month ago and hooked up with a few times is something she thought is okay? Is it?

&amp;#x200B;

I know he met him through a good mutual friend of hers on her birthday, and maybe that has to do with it (given she might not want things to be awkward between her good friends) but I just find it odd.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do about it.

This led me to be in a relationship with someone I wasn’t attracted to physically, because I was desperate and afraid of being lonely. That relationship lasted a few weeks because I came to realize I wasn’t being fair to her, but I had never been with anyone else before her and I want to be able to say I’ve had A girlfriend before. This was a year ago. I have not gone out on a single date with anyone since this happened because I was staying away from dating because I wasn’t doing well on dating apps (which is what led me to settle), and I think there’s another reason too.

When I want things, I want them as soon as possible. I can buy something from Amazon right now and wait for it to arrive, because I can track the package. I can know when it will arrive, or at least have a prediction of when it will happen. If I order food from a restaurant, I order what I want and I know it will come to me. If they’re out of something, I can settle for something else.

Relationships don’t work like that it seems. I cannot predict when I’m going to find someone (unlike Amazon where I can predict when a package is coming), I cannot settle for less than what I want (unlike at a restaurant where I’ll order something else if they’re out), and I don’t feel like I should have to wait months or even years for a girlfriend when I want one NOW, because everyone else has one. I feel like it’s time to quit dating permanently because there are so many factors that I don’t have any control over and I don’t like not having control over things. Also, I have autism. If that’s not a red flag for girls I don’t know what is.

Also, if a relationship is supposed to be “a cool bonus to life,” how is it any different than buying something on Amazon that’s not the color you wanted, but still liked? Isn’t the thing I bought from Amazon “a cool bonus to life” as well?

Dating is just so complicated. I don’t even know why I’m still doing it. I’m glad I had that one girlfriend for a few weeks a year ago that I wasn’t attracted to, because that may as well have been my only chance. At least I’ve had one girlfriend in my life.

Moving forward heading to week 3 of texting and calling each other almost everyday during a convo this guy ask me btw ""are you single?"" Now I'm confuse cause why would I be giving you my attention if I wasn't. 
I told him yes and reciprocated the question he replied Honestly, I have somebody, but I really like you and been wanting to talk to you in forever

I ask him why are talking to other people his reply it's just hard to be faithful..

I ditched him and told him I wasn't with it..
Mind you I didn't get upset or anything. I just said forget it, time wasted.

He aint texted me back for months. 
Now he's texting me out of the blue, asking me why I throw him to the side like that and why I treated him like that?

Seems pretty much like he's trying to guilt trip me.

I'm in a LTR now and my current gf is a lot more mild (I wouldn't say vanilla but just inexperienced).

How do I approach this without hurting her feelings? She's already sort of offended I won't explore it more...Or that I'm telling her ""who she is"". It's led to some fights/tension around the topic.

So me (f22) and my ex (m24) were together for 10 months (Nov2019-Aug2020). I was a bit of a late bloomer and he was my first real relationship at the ripe age of 20. despite my age i was still a bit naive and emotionally immature. some backstory about me, im very much the sensitive, empathetic type with a rocky childhood of divorced parent wars, isolation and lack of emotional support (fun ik) and my ex who actually experienced something similar except i came out emotionally demanding and he came out emotionally suppressed. now being the technical, realist type. pretty opposite of each other. 

Anyway, like most new relationships we had our “honeymoon phase” but once we got to around may-june i felt things start to shift. he became a lot less attentive and the relationship felt very one sided on my part. he felt so far away, like he wasn’t even there. but he had his moments when he was super sweet and it gave me reassurance. i could tell he was struggling though. he had a lot of issues externalizing everything inside and spent most of his time just feeling bleh. he was never mean to me, just absent. he was a really really great guy, he just struggled a lot with himself internally. 

since i struggle a lot with mental health it definitely took a toll on him. he wanted to help me but didn’t know how. he was a doer and a fixer and often mental illness doesn’t need a reason, it often just is (if that makes sense) so unless there was a prominent reason i was sad or anxious he just kinda froze. there was no clear solution for him to act on. 

eventually it came to a point where all we really did was bicker and i felt like i had to fight for his attention and affection. in august 2020 he decided to call it. 
he said he felt all he did was hurt me and i didn’t deserve that. Our breakup was super sad i still vividly remember two things he said. 
i apologized for crying so much and he said “its ok to cry, theres no enough emotion in the world” that hurt especially knowing how he struggled with expressing. 
and 
“you’re really special and you deserve someone who can fully appreciate and care for you”
we cut communication for a year and a half and deleted each other off everything besides facebook, not cutting ties completely. he told me he would always be around if i needed anything that he still cared. 

we tried really hard to make it work but we were simply just not right for each other…
he was truly a sweet and caring person and he really did try but struggled everyday. 
we both moved on but we still care about each other so much and im so grateful to have had him in my life. he was my first love as well as a majority of my other firsts even if he wasn’t perfect. i learned so much from him and grew so much as a person thanks to him

he ended up reconnecting with me on friday feb 11 a year and a half later seeing how i’ve been. we met up that sunday for lunch to catch up. seeing him again was definitely a surreal experience lol but it was actually nice. he told me how we would check up on me every now and then through facebook and i told him how i did the same. 

we sat at the diner we used to go to regularly and just talked about our lives for a few hours. i was really scared to go but i’m really glad i did. i can tell he’s really grown as a person and did a lot of self reflection during the time we spent apart and he kept apologizing saying he didn’t treat me and value me how he should’ve and how i deserved. that despite breaking up he never had intentions to completely cut me out of his life and is hoping we could still be friends, if it was ok with me. my issue is, idk if i can, im still trying to figure it out. the problem is theres this a piece of me that still and always will love him but im afraid if being active friends with him could cause me to fall for him again. 

now, when he first messaged me he didnt have “get back together” intentions, more just “i have a lot of care a respect for you and want to still keep you in my life” intentions. but i dont think he threw getting back together completely off the table, its not a spoken discussion but its not 100% gone. im aware getting back together with an ex is often not a good idea but theres always that rare “right person wrong time” situation. at the time of our relationship we were still very much figuring ourselves out as individuals which caused us to end up on different planes. 

It could still be too early and i need to maybe see him more to gauge the situation better but im still unsure what to do. should i be friends with him and keep it at that and sort out my own issues or should i allow in the possibilities of getting back together? 

obviously with that, itll be lead by a serious conversation between the two of us with the understanding that it could end the same way as before. along with the agreement that there will be no try number 3, no turning this into an on again off again thing. thatll just cause more unnecessary ache. 

im aware it’s a very dangerous game im playing rn. but im very stuck going back and forth with myself.

I've forever (since I was old enough to have crushes) been stuck terrified that guys just are not going to be attracted to me, and this fear has largely come true in the form of boys asking me out as a joke in grade school or making fun of my appearance, guys flirting with me and then forgetting about me once I ended up attached or just ignoring me altogether, men in my field (tech) condescending to me and generally showing themselves to not respect me, let alone be nice to me or interested in me. I've never been asked out or anything.

I never really wanted to try dating apps but I tried them reluctantly when the pandemic started. It took me a year+ to finally stop feeling panicky whenever I opened the app and since then I've been on a small handful of okay dates. I'm completely fine with making casual conversation with strangers, so I never have an issue of nerves or difficulty getting to know people - it's just the romantic component where part of my brain just short circuits. I find it so hard to have any confidence that a guy will like me or be attracted when my experiences so far have been purely negative. I feel like I'm always just waiting for the guy to start laughing at me like I'm a joke to him. I honestly feel like if this is something normal that everyone goes through then I just don't see how anyone ends up in a relationship because it feels so terrible.

I don't even know where these fears originated from, since I felt this way for as long as I could remember. The one factor is that I went through total hair loss as a young child and it never grew back, so that obviously impacted my body image, but I know other people with this condition who date just fine and have no issues. I thought exposing myself more through apps would help, but attempting to date more is making things worse instead of better. I've seen half a dozen therapists and no one seems to be able to help with dating in any real meaningful way, they just either tell me to keep persevering on the apps or get off the apps altogether.

I receive a lot of messages from black women and few from other minority women saying I was stereotyping her, I didn't want women of my own race so on and so forth. 

Well So let's dig deeper into this argument.  I don't know if it will cause me to be banned from this sub but read me my post until the end at least. 

Here the recent article written by a biracial black woman saying she now want to date black men after her preference (white men) dumped her for years. 
 
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/11/style/modern-love-black-boyfriend-applications.html

This article could be used to explain the type of black women I see everyday and what I deal with on a daily basis. So the black women saying I am a ""red flag"" because I don't date black women, I want to remind you that I am not your first choice . There is also something that the author said that I think is quite true. She said that back in the day, if a man were basic looking and white, he was her type. And this sentence reflect how many black women I know navigate in intraracial and interracial dating . 

Also currently we are in black month history, supposed to be the month where anything that empowers the black race is displayed. And one the key theme alongside generational wealth and economic reparations is the black family. But below the link of one the last trending on Twitter: White boyfriend reveal day .

Did I really need to develop on this one with the context that I just gave ? 

https://twitter.com/aaronmedwards/status/1493376064894259201?t=URLOWGuE0IEk9Rct9x4ANw&amp;s=19.

Another post. This time here on reddit, on r/BlackgGirlDiaries. In this post, OP explains why white men and black women seem guenine relationships and why she be support that . 

https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackGirlDiaries/comments/sl910g/anyone_else_find_themselves_supporting_black/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
 

I have ton and tons of example like that. But my favorite example on here is for black women who succeed on the professional level or insanely attractive. Modelling, lawyer, Financial analyst, dentist etc... I dare one of them to show me a black husband or one desesperate for a black man. If only one of them manage that, I will change my view on the topic. 

There are attributes to black men I never saw. I never see a black woman saying ""black men don't approach me. Maybe there are shy or are afraid of me. Maybe I should smile more, maybe I should give hints I am interested "".  You know these kind of good attributes which makes you understand that you have your chance .Or I never see a black man appreciation post( I never see that). The list is so long . I also didn't speak of movement such as divesting or swirling. Or I didn't speak of how black women can come and say to other black women :"" You are too attractive to date a black man ""  or ""How can you be successful and date a black woman ?"" or praising a black man for having a white lover/boyfriend/husband. 
  
I didn't speak of how on reddit or Tiktok black women feel low when they don't attract white men. I also have this video of black model in America's next Top Model (but I agree thag this show was overall cringe and had a lot of shitty situations ) crying after being said by a guy that he doesn't date black girl. 

(https://youtu.be/B-NdtcmxFkU) 

I  am not asking black women to fall over me. I am asking them if I am their first choice . You can accuse me of being colorist or don't like women who like me. But again here what I witnessed during my childhood, my teens years and now in my adulthood. 
So to the Ladies who asked me the last time why I don't date black women, I am going to answer you with this question.  Did you know a black woman who gueninely want a black man ? 

Because me I never see that and I doubt that I will see that one day. So yeah I am 21, I know nothing . I don't know how things work. But I have witnessed enough things to have my own opinion on some situations.  

Concerning minority women, yeah that's the same thing too. I have discussed with some indians or asian friends of mine and that's a mutual feeling. 


Edit 1: Feel free to answer. To discuss, I am all hears. Also to clean up things, I am not saying black woman dating black man is bad. If you want to fight me over this, please no. That's your right and don't come for me because of that. I am just saying I am not preference of black woman. Plain and simple. 

Edit 2: I forgot to mention something the last time when I say mixed race women. I was not thinking black mixed with non-black. I was thinking other type of persons. Mixed race women are, according to my experience stuck up towards black men and prefer strongly white men. This one is a non discussion.

My first message in short said “hey [name] if you’re ever in town and want to catch up my door is open”. She said she’d be in town most of February and agreed to meeting whenever she actually gets in town. I suggested 3 places, one was a chill kind of lunch place and the other two were bars. In my mind this was my way of determining if she was interested. She said she loved the two bars and was fine with either.

We broke up because he  didn't treat me right or value me, he was emotionally unavailable, we talked for a whole year before he actually kissed me and would push and pull with me along with gaslighting me most of the time,so I called it off and we have respect for each other and we stay friends...

So he asked me to hangout so I guess a first date, and said what do I wanna do. I'm an awkward person and have pretty bad social anxiety and nervousness, so I don't like dinner for thr first date. So I suggested stuff like maybe bowling, puttput, age throwing, etc. Some activity to help with my nerves. But he replied with ""how about we do lunch/dinner and see what ya wanna do from there?:)

So should I tell him straight up dinner/lunch dates for the first time make me nervous and anxious, and if so how do I do thst without sounded rude or snobby.

The first time was just a brief encounter but the second time he had offered to buy me a drink and after a little incident at the bar, I gave him my Instagram for him to update me on something. This was around mid-last year. 

Following this, occasionally he would reply to my Instagram stories. But unlike other guys who respond with heart eyes to my photos, his replies would be more to things like my posts of art galleries, restaurants etc., and asking general questions. He would sometimes drag it on and ask how my day was going etc. Eventually, he got my Snapchat too and we send a Snapchat almost every day  but they are of boring things like food etc. 

I recall in one of the earlier conversations I kind of nudged him to ask me on a date since he kept replying to my stories I assumed he was interested but he replied ""are you trying to get me to ask you on a date hahaha"" ""I'll consider it"" - a response I've never gotten so I was kind of shocked but I assumed it might be my age, after this he would still sometimes reply to my IG story about trivial things. 

Beginning of this year I posted a photo of a lookout I went to to which he replied to and asked where it was. I jokingly told him to ""take me"" and we ended up going on a 2-hour drive to the lookout. A few of my friends told me that he must like me considering he was willing to go for a long drive to watch the sunset and stargaze with someone he barely knew. I think this is true but the date was so platonic... he didn't pull any moves other than holding my hand when we were climbing a rock and a quick piggy back down ( some of my guy friends said they would do this for any girl so did not think much of it). 

We don't message regularly other than daily snaps of our lunch and random stuff. But **a** **month** **after** the drive, he asked me to lunch because he had a day off. I assumed it might be a date because he was willing to spend his entire day off on me but again, nothing happened on this date/lunch/hangout?. He paid for the lunch and I paid for the arcade, we had a fun time but I'm used to guys pulling moves on me whereas he seemed very platonic. I even offered him my drink and instead of drinking from the same straw, he poured it into his used cup? 

It's been 2 weeks since and no mention of a third date/hangout?. Honestly, I do kind of like him and I see potential. I have tried to send very direct flirty messages (before the lunch date) where he just replies ""ahahaha"" and says a very platonic joke.. It's just so platonic and I even asked him if he felt uncomfortable while I was flirting to which he replied ""no??"" 

Basically, I feel like he might be testing the waters with me, doesn't know how to date, or doesn't like me at all but doesn't know how to reject me? I'm not sure what to do, I can't even flat out ask him since it's not like we text every day but I do kind of like him. I'm used to guys being more proactive so I don't know if I should be taking this as rejection.

He initiated that conversation. Things were already pretty intense between us, but after we decided to commit, he started really expressing his intentions for a serious relationship (vocally affirming his deep feelings for me, making travel plans, talking about me meeting friends/family, he gave me a key so I could work from his place - I have an older post about that) and I was feeling very secure and safe with him. 

However, I very recently discovered (he just told me) that for those first two months that we dated, up until only a week or two before we had our exclusive talk, he was seeing another girl from out-of-state and from what it seems, they had a fairly intimate emotional connection. I honestly feel very blindsided and confused. For the past 3 months we have been texting throughout the day, every day, and I just feel so… betrayed in a way, because I had perceived that consistent communication to be something special between us two. Learning that that entire time he was sharing an emotional connection with someone else really hurts. 

He has been very reassuring that he is confident in his choice and only wants to be with me, but I feel so uncomfortable and honestly quite gross thinking about him with another woman. I want to talk to him and ask him about the nature of their relationship so badly but he’s away on an important work trip and it’s not fair or appropriate to have this conversation yet. So in the meantime I’m burning with sadness and anger and confusion, and just don’t know what to think or feel.

If he were anyone else, I probably would have walked away, but he is quite literally the man of my dreams. Two years ago in quarantine I wrote out a detailed checklist of what my ideal boyfriend would look like and he checks off every single box (and more). I am so attracted to him in so many ways and really want a future with him, but the timeline of it all feels so wrong… 

TL;DR: Been dating the man of my dreams, but I just learned that 6 weeks into us talking every single day, he has a girl come sleep in his bed for an entire week, has me come sleep on that same bed the week immediately after… and then 2 weeks later he’s asking me to be exclusive?? And then like 10 days later I have a key to his apartment? And three weeks after that is when I discover the truth. It all feels very fast, confusing, and strange.

First time being for coffee and second coffee again but I am honestly unsure if she just seems me as a friend or potentially something more than that.

There are no signs from her side she feels very neutral, neither do I show any, but am unsure if I should make a move. How do I make it clear that am seeking her romantically? I just hope she doesn’t think I dm’ed her trying to be friends, surely not?

I’m hind sight she was prob more surprised than anything. Then we went on this hang out prior to the date. Me, her, and a couple other friends. We played board games and we were having a blast, I was sneaking looks at her and she was doing the same back. Each with a smile when I caught her. After our final showing of the production we were working on, she texted ME and told me that I did a great job on the show, of course I replied and told her the same. All of this made me think she was at least interested in me, apparently not

The date went fine, it was a lot of fun. We went out to eat as planned, roads were icy and I was the one driving the group, we ended up deciding to go bowling rather than a movie, but when we got to the bowling alley, they said they were completely sold out due to a tournament happening that day, so we ended up going to the same friends house and played board games with for the hang out prior to the date, it was fun, had some laughs and that was that. To me, it wasn’t what I wanted when I asked her out on a date, I got to know her a bit better at dinner, and I got to learn some of her weird musical interests while playing board games and while we were driving around. And the time came where people’s cerfews were upon us and we wrapped it up. I was gonna drop her off last so we could have a talk before we said our good nights. But she said she needed to be home asap, so I dropped her off first and dropped every body off after, then I gave her a call.

When she picked up I asked her how she felt about the date, she said she thought it was fun, I proceeded to tell her that I was really into her and I wanted to keep going out with her, she gave me a reluctant yeah and gave me the rundown on why she can’t really go out on too many dates(really strict parents) I wanted to ask her if she like me at all back, but I already knew the answer and I didn’t feel like crying over the phone. So I wished her a good night and hung up, later I texted her saying I was really bad at talking about this sort of thing and I asked if she liked me back, and told her I completely respected her parents judgement.

She replied saying she respected my openness and honesty about it, but she only see’s me as a friend.

Idk man, it hurts so bad when you genuinely think something is there and it just isn’t. I just can’t stop crying and thinking I messed up somewhere, I don’t know how to move on within a reasonable time. The last time I was friend zoned it took me years to move on and have the confidence to open up to somebody in that way. Although the last time I did she accused me of rape and turned my entire friend group against me. That was pretty traumatizing happening at such a young age for me. So my confidence was already really fragile. Now it’s In shambles. I genuinely don’t know what to do, I just feel so hopeless. This is my last semester in highschool, if I can’t figure out dating here how am I expected to do it in the real world. How are other people so good at reading the signals. How the hell can anyone do that. Do I just have to hope to get lucky and find someone that miraculously finds me attractive. And then pray for another miracle that I pick up on it?

 I just recently started dating the most wonderful guy I’ve ever spoken to and I’m so excited but also afraid because of my past experiences with my ex’s.

Yet, I have moved on and healed quite a bit since then, and I finally caught feelings for someone after a fairly long time and eventually started dating them just this past weekend (we’ve known each other for around 6 months but we started seeing each other early 2022 &amp; confessed a few days ago) 
I feel so happy. I am genuinely attracted to him and it makes such a huge difference for me and my ability to receive and give affection, since in my last relationships I had difficulty doing both of those things since all I felt was uncomfortable and pressured to do things for the other person.  We held each other for such a long time and I didn’t feel unsafe when he touched me. I was just in shock that someone could actually make me feel the opposite of anxious when being intimate so I just held on to him and hugged him for as long as I could when I saw him last and he was okay with it. I get so emotional just thinking about it, I don’t know, is that weird? Is it too early to be thinking that I can feel safe around him?

I slept with this guy for the first time on the 2nd date. We watched a movie, hung out and I spent the night at his.

After sex he made it very clear that he wants us to do this again, constantly told me to come over again. 

After this, his communication changed drastically. He got very inconsistent with messaging and wasn’t anymore interested in how my day went etc. Earlier we chatted daily. 

After a week he finally asked do I wanna come over again. I definitely wanted to. We decided we’ll meet in a week or so and agreed to talk about it later. I messaged him later, he agreed again that we should meet, but didn’t show ANY enthusiasm to make the plans. I cut my losses and we didn’t meet unfortunately nor did he message me no more.

I didn’t expect him to message me anymore, I assumed he’s not interested, but he did contact me a month later after that last interaction. He just texted “how are you”. 

I didn’t respond because I value communication even from fuckbuddies, even though we hadn’t even decided if that’s what we are. And I felt like I was an option that he can treat however he wants, which isn’t fine with me. 

(He had set expectations that sex isn’t the only thing on his mind, but probably only to get me in bed?)

This guy is 23, very good looking, and obviously has also lots of options, but just like I do. We met on Tinder. He definitely pursued me; I told him I won’t come over on the 1st date, he definitely would’ve found someone else to do that, but still kept on trying and took me out on a date. 

I doubt it’s about me, because he still wanted to meet me more after sex and still tries to contact me, but **is it common for many good looking guys his age just enjoy the “hunting” process of getting a woman in their bed, and then they move on to the next girl?**

I’ve checked his social media stats and he definitely has slept with other beautiful girls too, but still his Tinder profile is constantly active, he adds new photos constantly and pays for the premium.

1. He said “I love stand-up comedians such as x,y, and Louis CK. People tried to cancel him but I think what he did in his personal life shouldn’t affect him professionally.”

2. He went to the same college as me and brought up a spreadsheet on Twitter that went viral when the #MeToo movement started. It had a list of guys that assaulted women at our college who were a part of the organization. 

He said his friend was on the list and definitely did not do anything. I think he was insinuating how girls will throw a guy under the bus just to get back at him. 

3. He said he’s made a lot of mistakes in dating, and sometimes he feels like he can’t move forward. Or that God is holding him back.

we met through friends and started talking and she ended up asking me out im 22M
shes 22F

little bit later she told me shes emotionally unavailable so she cant promise a relationship but shes interested yadda yadda so we keep dating  she then also recently told me she thinks she non monogamous but is not looking for anyone else etc rn 

fast forward we got intimate very fast, the fastest out of anyone shes said 

anyways ive stayed at her house twice, we have had sex multiple times to boot since apparently that matters

she tells me how happy she is that i turn her on etc.  but i feel i have been losing her and she iniates less and less..i feel like the bottom of the totem pole to her and mainly used for sex/attention really lately. 

the first time i stayed over it was awkward at first because she had lost a bunch of friends and was depressed but didnt want to cancel on me so i wasnt pushing anything
she ended up making the first move after we went on a date and got down with it 

thursday i stayed over, we had a great time she said how happy she is a whole bunch of shit and that she trusts me etc so i asked if we could see each other this week but she was busy so next week and said she will lmk

over the weekend i noticed shes been distant, so i gave her space and we caught up over voice tuesday.  she told me her kitchen is flooding her basement is destroyed theres lots of mold on the first floor and that she is going to have to move and probably get a job before she ends college in june.  

her kitchen was fine today and she had some friends over so i asked if late next week i could take her out and get her mind off things, to have a good day. 

she replied with she wants to take some time for a while to get her stuff together and feels overwhelmed  
we have went on a break before but she texted me like hours after she asked lol. 

i said thats fine asked about contact and such but she then said if i really want to contact her but sorry if she doesnt seem happy etc.  and she would like me to be patient etc 
i said ill let her be and she said thank u 
this didnt happen on our first break. 

we are seeing each other for a movie with friends in like 2 weeks and i dont want to sit around not knowing if shes interested still or what have u

i asked and she then went off and said she likes spending time whatever but shes not feeling a connection lately, that i dont seem comfortable around her, she doesnt feel seen or understood which i dont understand that it takes a lot of effort to disarm and slow down to be with her along with some other stuff she said 

part of this is all because with stuff in the pst im learning what i can and cant do with her because of her emotional unavailability and such and not wanting to make her uncomfortable. 

anyways tomorrow we are gonna talk over voice and see how it goes, i doubt shes gonna want to see each other the same but who knows. i will tell her if she decides this theres a strong chance we wont ever talk again, i cant just be strung and wait forever if shes unsure. 

im prepared to use a lot of i statements too however to make sure im not blaming her.  although i feel shes putting everything on me now too. and i hope this all just puts her into making a decision she may regret. 

any tips on what i should say/do?

thanks everyone

I always tried to be fully respectful towards women, back off when I think they're feeling uncomfortable, and not act like a creep. But recently, more and more girls I've talked with, tell me stories about the guys they met up with. It usually goes something like ""Well, he did try to take me to his room, so I thought he was a creep, but still talked to him. Then he hugged me, so I told him to back off and that I don't want to do it. But then he started kissing me and I realized I actually really like him, and we had an amazing time"". Or more extremely, one friend got drunk and a guy tried to slip his hand under her skirt on two separate occassions. She HATED it at first, but then she decided that he is nice and confident and that she wants to be with him. I couldn't push myself to do such things after getting rejected once, because I would feel like doing something bad.
