We had a great connection and there was undeniable chemistry. The eye contact, body language, and everything else made it obvious that it was a go. We also slept together that night/morning multiple times. 

Stupid me made an impulsive mistake pretty shortly after and ended up cutting contact for no reason, essentially ghosting him. I‚Äôm going to be honest: even though he was the one initiating with texts, etc., he didn‚Äôt move fast enough for me so that‚Äôs why I cut off contact. I was afraid of him rejecting me even though there were no signs that he would‚Äôve. 

Some background info: I have a history of childhood abuse/trauma that now manifests as intimacy issues/fears that cause me to destroy my romantic relationships. This guy changed me, though. It was different and fueled me to really do work on myself to recognize and overcome these issues. Sadly though, he isn‚Äôt around for me to prove myself.

Over the past year, we‚Äôve stayed ‚Äúconnected‚Äù by watching each other‚Äôs Instagram stories (him usually doing it first, then I‚Äôll look back‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt follow each other, so we have to go out of our ways to search our usernames) and recently he swiped right on me on a dating app. I also swiped right, so now we‚Äôre matched. I ended up sending a message through the app and he hasn‚Äôt responded. It‚Äôs been about 4 days. Note: I‚Äôve also reached out a couple times over the last year and he was understandably cold. I probably made it worse because I didn‚Äôt apologize and ended up being awkward due to nerves and feeling like an idiot. 

The only reason I messaged first now was because I‚Äôve been sensing he wants to connect, but feels apprehensive to reach out (looking at stories/swiping on me). I thought I‚Äôd break the ice with a casual message, then if he responded I‚Äôd send an apology for everything that‚Äôs happened in the last year.

I don‚Äôt get it: this guy prides himself on being upfront and honest. So why doesn‚Äôt he just tell me he doesn‚Äôt have an interest if he doesn‚Äôt? Why stay connected to me and now swipe on me (and no, I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúguys just swipe‚Äù and ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt realize it was me‚Äù - we have history and he obviously knows me)? Could he be trying to get me back for what I did?

My first relationship was when I was 23 and that went on for 5 years. After it ended I briefly dated two women in that time before I met someone last year. That went on for 6 months but ended fairly recently. She met someone very quickly which I found a bit tough because my go to processing was ""he's better looking/more confident etc"" (of course not healthy). Those are the only women I've ever been with - they were all attractive I think but feeling like 4 women isn't many, and a combination of little success in OLD and a lot of self confidence problems I've had since I was young (difficult childhood, but I guess that's many people) made me a bit of a late bloomer in the lady department has always made it hard to really feel totally at ease with myself as a person. 

I've been to therapy and read books and a lot of the advice is ""go on more dates and meet more people, it will make you more secure and confident that you will meet someone in the long run"". But what if you find it difficult to get dates/meet people especially during lockdown? I feel like I'm in a catch 22 here where I'm told to build confidence I need to date more, but I'm trapped not being able to secure dates to do that?

I'm literally in a country where I know nobody as I type this. I like to adventure on my own, read on subjects nobody around me likes to talk about, and spend a fairly good amount of my day alone. 

However, I've never had an issue with wanting to share this with someone. In fact, I think finding someone who is on my same wavelength, life vision, and attitude would be the most exciting thing ever. I've always been a hopeless romantic (I've written letters to a future hypothetical life partner). 

There's no way to say this without sounding pretentious, but I'm aware that my interests, adventurous attitude, and physical wellbeing/looks come to be attractive to a lot of women. I often go out on dates to see where things go. Sometimes its clear out of the gate, sometimes I need a couple weeks, but I never find anyone that I think would complement my life as I envision it. 

Until maybe 1 month ago, when I met someone who is almost exactly like me. She is adventurous, curious, knows all my favorite authors and scientists, and loved challening herself. 

Well, we hit it off, very well. She said in all her life she had never even considered dating someone seriously until she met me. She explained that she is aware of a lot of childhood trauma that doesn't allow her to open up to others, and therefore decided she wanted to live alone forever. 

After a couple weeks I noticed she wasn't all that excited to see me versus doing other things. Except when I did see her, she seemed very excited and didn't even want me leaving. We talked about some of this and she explained she was doubting her decisions because se truly wants to keep the priviledge of acting selfishly without having to consider others. However, she keeps me somewhat engaged by saying that her feelings are real.and that she is only afraid of losing her independence out of the feelings she have for me.

This makes me feel that one day she may realize its worth it, and dive in love with me. I hang on to this idea that is just in my head. 

This is hurting me, but I am unsure what to do, as she is probably one of the few people in this world (so far), whom I connected intellectually, physically, and emotionally.

On and off‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a bit complicated and there have been lots of different pulls and pushes with it. He 100% helped me get over my ex very quickly. But I got quite attached to him quick quickly too. I think one of the main reasons I wanted him so badly is because I knew I couldn‚Äôt have him. He was an ex JW and was coming out of his shell and I was the first person he‚Äôd been having regular sex with. And it was really fun! He‚Äôd always told me that he didn‚Äôt want a relationship, which at the start I was very happy with. But the more time we spent together (a week over the Xmas period), I wanted a bit more. I decided to stop talking to him and deleted his number. But knew his name so messaged him on FB ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è He was glad I‚Äôd got back in touch and was keen to see me. So we hooked back up, quite a few times‚Ä¶ and then I did the same and ended it, and again a third time. The wknd we decided would be our last, my step dad died and I had to rush off to my Mum‚Äôs and leave him at mine cos we‚Äôd been drinking. I asked him to leave me a note before he left and he wrote me the most beautiful letter. We do love each other but he just doesn‚Äôt want a relationship with me.

Ive been dating a girl for 1 month. We find our time together extremely fun and fulfilling. I really want to keep dating her for the long run. 

She explained she had dated before but I was the first person she has actually considered dating seriously. However, she knows she has a tendency to want to be able to act selfishly without hurting others. 

We set boundaries at being exclusive physically and emotionally. All good there. 

However, its been a few times where we ""agreed"" to focus in our own things for a few days and then agree to see each other in a specific day. Its been 3 times now that she cancels because something else she was excited to do, came up. We are both sporty and adventurous, we both are trying out free diving and bouldering, she practices parkour and I compete in brazilian jiujitsu. 

So I figured these would be very fun things to do together. But she decides she prefers to do them on her own, and that me coming along would somehow impede on her independence or sense of individuality. 

I dont mind having our own time. But I do feel hurt when I am looking forward to seeing her one day and she cancels last minute to do something else, that I would personally find interesting to do together. 

I try to not take it personally, but I am not sure if Im justifying her being too selfish to neglect my time and feelings. As well as a sense of me being ""safe"" and that it wont matter if we see each other because I will want to see her another day anyway.

I (M25) went through a breakup about a month ago and I've been in no contact with my ex for almost 30 days now. I want her back, and there are several breakup coaches that I've found on YouTube who offer varying viewpoints on who should reach out to who after a breakup. I was dumped (the details are below if you care for them), and some coaches say that the person who was dumped should reach out after 30 days while others say that the dumpee should wait for the dumper to reach out, regardless of how long it takes. I'm wondering if anyone has had success with getting an ex back. And if so, would you mind sharing your story? I'm trying to decide whether I should reach out to my ex this weekend after 30 days of not talking.

If you'd like more details on my breakup, they're below: 

We dated for about a year. She broke up with me, citing a lack of physical chemistry as the main cause of our breakup. The day it ended she asked me to meet her outside one of our favorite restaurants. I knew that it was coming. We sat down in her car. She was crying. She was also shaking and she had trouble meeting my eye at first. But she did look at me when she delivered the fatal blow. She told me that everything else was good, but she just felt like our physical connection had withered. I can't know for sure if that was the only reason, although the one she gave was true - I had a lot of things going on in my life at the time leading up to our breakup and I was mostly responsible for a decline in physical intimacy between us. Once it was done she said that she wanted to be friends. I told her no, and that I still wanted more. We talked for about an hour while she answered my questions. I don't remember all of my ""questions."" It was mostly just the two of us dreading me leaving the car. I do remember asking her if she was sure. She looked at me and nodded. She said that she didn't see us getting back together, and that she was sorry for hurting me. But she said that she was thankful for the time we spent together. I got out of the car, and saw her sobbing. So I went around to her door and gave her one last hug before leaving. 

Anyway without going into more details, I'll just say that I have decided that I want her back, and I have resolved to be more purposeful in showing the physical intimacy that I truly desire to give to her. If she'll have me back. I'm not sure if she will, and I know that she said she didn't see us getting back together.

As I have been ghosted by a woman who I have a lengthy history with and have instense feelings for. 
Me and her have known each other since high school in 2012 and were closely acquainted with one another through high school even until after high school. We shared quite a few intimate moments during high school as well.  While knowing her during that time i grew strong feelings for her and they only grew stronger as time went on. 

A few months after high school in 2017 we ran into each other at the mall and had a really fun spontaneous date which led to really passionate kisses in the parking lot, but then after our date, she disappeared out of my life for 4 years which devastated me. For a duration of that time I feared she had died and it has been confirmed through outside sources she had some really dark moments which severely damaged her hence why she‚Äôs the way she is today. 

About a month ago i found her facebook page and i couldn‚Äôt resist sending her a friend request because those old feelings came back,she accepted immediately. after a few failed attempts to get her to come on a date , the following week while me and other friends were at a vacation house, she hits me up asking me to hang out and actually shows up to hang for a while. While she was with us all she would not keep her hands off me, nor would she stop kissing me or holding my hand, all my friends saw and couldn‚Äôt believe it. We invited her to come to the club with us and she initially agreed but had to leave to get changed because her pants were ripped, she cancelled as well because she said she got her period but the next day she‚Äôs on snapchat kayaking with friends. 

After a few more failed attempts to get her on a date; she came over my place on wednesday july 7 after requesting to see me. When she came over we consummated our feelings and slept together. The next morning she didnt want to leave or stop cuddling.

 After she left she and I went back and forth until Monday last week when she stopped responding to me and started leaving me on opened. just like that she‚Äôs out of my life again and ive been sick the last week wondering what happened between us wondering if i‚Äôll ever see her again. 

The last week my mind has been wondering with so many unanswered questions. I suspect i may remind her too much of her ex boyfriend because he looks a lot like me. Or maybe i could‚Äôve said something or did something to make her go cold. I don‚Äôt exactly know, but I really need closure. I texted her the other morning asking her how she was but she didn‚Äôt respond.

Girls have had crushes on me or liked me but I've always turned them down. I'm a pretty decent looking guy I'd say or it's what I've been told anyways. I have also had groups of girls ask me if I wanted a girlfriend or what type of girls I like. I just ignore them or just sorta change the subject. I remember 3-4 different girls that asked ME out and I liked them but I turned them down. My family always ask if I'm talking to any girls and I usually just say something silly to ignore the subject.

The reason I think I do this is because I feel like I'm not good enough for them, not physically but wealth and popularity. I've always been poor, my family is poor and I don't have a big social media presence. My home is a horrible embarrassment I feel like that looks old and falling apart. I just don't feel like I'm in a position where I can offer a nice date or even a nice living to a girl in a relationship. All I have is me and the time I have to offer. I try to take care of myself physically, working out, skincare, etc. 

I have only ever tried to talk to 1 girl last year and it seemed to be going alright but then she ghosted me. She's the only girl I've ever messaged. I had a strong attraction towards her and she gave a lot of signs she was attracted to me but I looked at it as karma for rejecting all the girls I have. Got a taste of the rejection I had given I guess lol. It took a lot for me to even talk to her because I felt like I wasn't ready or wasn't good enough.

The only reason I messaged the girl last year is because I told someone about the deep attraction  I had towards her and they said I should shoot my shot because you may not be attracted to another girl like that for a long time and I figured it was sound logic. 

So I want a relationship but don't feel ready I guess. I feel like once a girl gets to know me she'd be no longer interested.

He is my first real boyfriend and mostly my first on every other aspect.

He works until late every day of the week and wants at leat one day to see his friends (which is completely normal) so I get to see him only on Saturday, he doesn't talk much on the phone, I tried at the beginning but seeing that he didn't want to I lied and said that I, too, didn't like it. At first, it didn't bother me because when we are together everything is perfect. He's always lovely to me, care for me and makes me feel like I am the only one in his eyes. 

But once we are apart is like he has forgotten about me. Twice already I was suppose to come to his house and sleep there but he canceled at the last minute to see his friends or friends of work. 
Like any other girl at my age I struggle with body image even though I pretty ""standard"" (whatever that means), seeding nudes or stuff like that is really hard for me. Yesterday I had the courage to do it, he opened the photo but simply didn't responded, I hasn't expecting a sea of complements but something would have been nice. I told him that it wasn't nice what he did, he saw the massage and didn't responded. A bit angry, I messaged him saying that if once again and he left me on the open I would block him everywhere 
Surprise surprise... He saw the message and didn't responded 

Like I said, he is my first relationship so everything is new to me and I don't know how to act in certain situations, for example he has a LOT of female friends. They often go to his apartment and stay there until late at night. I once confronted him about it and he assured me that they are all just friends, sisters even...
I let it go because didn't want to seem jealous or possessive but still bothers me a bit.  

Now I don't know what to do. Do it block like I say I would? 
It will definitely create a conflict but that is the last thing I want, I just want for him to be there for me, respond me

Well, this isn't the update I wanted to post, but it's one I'm coming to terms with. The first date went spectacularly, and the second was even better. Like with what I said in the original post, she wowed me in ways I had never experienced in my dating life‚Äîor with any of my previous girlfriends. I was beyond flattered. The second date ended with a pretty heavy makeout session, and she let me take home a few things to 'borrow' from her house. We kissed goodbye, and she told me, ""I'm free like most weeknights. See you in July.""

She was in and out of town for the better part of a month. Over that time, she introduced me to a friend of hers. Her friend gave me an AC unit for free I badly needed, and I took that as a good sign. Although this girl isn't a great texter, we'd still flirt and chat. We made plans for a third date at a beach.

That date was supposed to be today. I texted to confirm plans, and unfortunately, she said she got with a friend of hers and she wants to see where that will go. I'm not mad, just disappointed. Looking back I suppose I could see it was tailing off over the last week‚Äîaround the time she was with her friend‚Äîbut my point still stands: I am so grateful for what she did to my self-confidence. They remain the best dates I've ever been on.

She wants to be friends, and I believe her. I want to be her friend too. I let her know what I said in my initial post on r/dating; I wanted to let her know how much I appreciated her personality. Her response was kind and endearing. Honestly, I still can't believe someone as stunning inside and out was/is into me. Such a nice feeling.

I have no reason to be mad at her. I'm sad. But, you know what? This is the best I've handled a rejection‚Äîand it's the kindest way anyone's ever rejected me. Thank you to the universe for putting her in my life. Whether or not that's the end of the story doesn't matter, I'm happy she's in my life.

Due to ED and body dysmorphia I haven't felt able to date for some years now, I didnt feel like someone who looked like me (I'm fat) was deserving of pleasure, so I stayed hidden from the world.

 I finally feel ready to start dating again but feel scared and anxious. I'm at my recovery weight and I'm not small, I'm healthier than I've ever been though but I'm still so anxious about people potentially body shaming me. I also am a survivor of child sex trafficking, so intimacy in general feels terrifying. I've been in therapy and such for years and am significantly better, but there is still that anxiety of being hurt by someone else. 

I've been denying myself closeness with another person because of trauma and mental health issues, and I feel like I'm at a point in my recovery where It'll  be good for me to be close to someone in a romantic way.

That‚Äôs fine, he did give me a heads up about it. 


My issue is sometimes I text him and he‚Äôs an absolute delight, we have great conversations and it feels like no time has passed since we‚Äôve seen each other but other times I‚Äôll text him and he‚Äôll be very short to answer or come off super moody.

I was like ‚Äúi don‚Äôt care about the effort‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs surely worth it‚Äù. And i still think that way, but not for every relationship.

I‚Äôve been on 2 dates in my entire life. I knew the first girl on Instagram, but she was the exact opposite of her instagram posts. So i learnt a precious lesson: some people can REALLY look like models on instagram, and be way less attractive ( surely not ugly, tho ) in real life. 

The second girl was a girl i found cute. She wasn‚Äôt objectively looking too, but i felt something different when i first saw her ( we are classmates ). Our first date was cool, everything was nice, but then i saw a 30/35 yo woman behind that girl. She was STARING and SMILING at me every 5 seconds. And she was very beautiful. 

From that moment on, i realized how important looks are. Ofc, loving a person is not just loving her looks: it‚Äôs basically loving that person as a whole. But when i noticed how shallow i am, i realized i can‚Äôt have a relationship yet. I need to lower my standards, because i‚Äôm not model-tier too. I‚Äôm pretty average, i just got a nice physique and i‚Äôm tall. 

So, the problem is that i won‚Äôt be able to be loyal ti a girl if i‚Äôm not physically attracted to her. That‚Äôs the main thing, the most important one for me ( i know it‚Äôs shallow to say, but i can‚Äôt deny it anymore ).

I'm currently 25 and haven't dated anyone since the pandemic started in April last year and honestly, the idea of dating just seems exhausting. 

I like the idea of a relationship but at this point in time, I don't feel like I have a lot to offer other than my personality and it's really just not a major priority for me anymore I guess? 

I'm pretty solitary when it comes to recharging my batteries but I love a small group of 4-5 people. 

What I'm getting at is the last few times I've been in relationships it always takes me forever to readjust to having to take someone else's feelings into consideration.  

Friends and Family I'm great at but when it comes to romance and looking for partners it feels like it's difficult to find someone that doesn't waste your time or who isn't an emotional vampire

She comes from a traditional family and we are from two different countries that happen to not like each other, so when she told her parents they blew up, even theeatening to kick her out, and their relationship hasnt been the same since. This made it hard to see each other but we managed to have classes together plus enough gaps between classes to be able to go to restaurants and other little date type things in secret. The idea was to wait out the storm, let parents relax into the idea, and get ourselves into positions where the opinions of parents didnt matter.

Fast forward to the pandemic and now we couldn't see each other at all, both because of her parent's being controlling and both having family members with serious health risks. She also suffered from mental health issues, which up until this point wasn't anything that turned me away or made me reconsider the relationship. She relied on me for support and i was happy to be it, and she was happy to be mine when needed. But during quarantine, being constantly distanced from each other and her friends while being confined with abusive family members her mental health went downwards and she became severly depressed and suicidal. The long distance while not even being able to call each other as well as constant fighting over nonsensical things and her jealousy began, and it developed to the point where i found myself not wanting to talk to her for fear that something i would say would spark another fight. I would see my friend circle once in a while to workout or hike and such and she became very jealous of my female friends in the group which was heightened by her inability to see me. She believed that I would leave her for one of them once i got tired of waitinf for her, which was nonsense to me, but i couldnt convince her otherwise.

 This cycle ended up making me feel depressed and trapped. I wanted to leave but I knew that i was the only person she relied on for any form of ""normal"" human contact and to support her mental health. She had even mentioned a few times that if it wasn't for me she mightve already committed suicide. I know that sounds intentionally manipulative, but i do believe she meant it, and didn't realize how manipulative it came off. Even though i wanted out of the relationship I felt like i couldnt leave because I still cared about her as a person since she was a good person, and I was genuinely worried what she might do to herself if i did. So i stayed for 7 more months after that. During that time i became very depressed myself; my grades dropped, i gained a lot of weight from eating my feelings, i started distancing from friends, and losing sight of my own goals in life. 

Eventually i came to a breaking point and ended the relationship. I've been on the mend for a bit now and feeling, and looking, like myself again, but i still think back and regret how far i let myself slip and how many opportunities to advance in life, like scholarships, research opportunities, and more, that i lost during that time due to how far i had let my mental health slip. 

Im not advocating at all for anyone to abandon their SO if they have mental health struggles, just that you be aware of if you're sacrificing yourself too much mentally for another, because it can be slow and sutble.

I‚Äôm (F23) talking to a guy (M27). We‚Äôve been talking for 3 months, but honestly it feels like I barely know him that well because we talk maybe once a week. Even then, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt get past hey how are you doing/how‚Äôs your week.

Am I wrong to feel upset about this? I haven‚Äôt addressed this yet and I don‚Äôt know if I even should. I don‚Äôt want to sound needy or immature (he is a few years older so I don‚Äôt want to run the risk of looking childish)

In the beginning, he texted more often, and then I started initiating more over time. I once recently called him to ask for advice on something and that led to a 2 hr phone conversation, but after that I have not heard much.

I like him a lot but I really want more frequent communication. We often talk about getting serious with one another. 
In my opinion, if you‚Äôre serious about someone wouldn‚Äôt you wanna text them more than once a week?

On one hand I‚Äôm thinking that maybe he feels so secure in how things are going between us that he doesn‚Äôt feel the need to check up and textü§£üòÇ jk
No but maybe he's just older and might think it's silly to text often?

I tried stopping to text him first all the time and that just resulted in us barely talking in over a week. It seems to not bother him. He assures me that he wants to be with me but I feel so insecure (what if he's talking to someone else? What if he's literally in a relationship with someone? What if he slowly is losing interest?) (I don't mean to seem needy it's just that past relationships/experiences have made me want to feel more secure in communication)

So how often do people who are getting to know eachother talk/text?

How can I ask for more communication efforts?

We switched back and forth with Google translate just to fully understand each other.

But I had a ‚Äútemplate‚Äù flow of interaction that helped me genuinely connect with anyone I‚Äôm talking to. I've learned it over the years because I'm a normally introverted, shy guy.

**Without this template, we would‚Äôve just been two strangers who chatted over coffee and went our separate ways ‚Äî never knowing we could‚Äôve fallen in love.**

I've learned it‚Äôs easier to connect with someone on a date and have an amazing time when the interaction flows a *certain* way:

# Have a 3-Location Plan Ready

In my experience, going from one location to another, when done well, significantly increases the feeling of closeness. Like those cliche movie lines; ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôve known you forever. Even if we‚Äôve just met.‚Äù The closer you feel, the more at ease you become. And your best selves come out more naturally.

**Location 1: A place of Introduction**‚ÄîSomeplace you can have an easy conversation. Low pressure. Get-to-know. And don't talk about dry topics like work or hobbies. Probe on Conversation Themes and play some Games (see below).

**Location 2: A place of movement**‚ÄîGive your bodies the opportunity to communicate. Go for a stroll or a dance club. It gives contrast to the date. Connecting with someone isn't just limited to talking.

**Location 3: A place for Intimate Conversation**‚ÄîThis girl and I met at a Starbucks, transferred to a bar where I told her about different local drinks, had a stroll at a nearby park while listening and dancing to each other's ""guilty-pleasure music,"" and finally, we walk to a spot where we can watch the city lights. It's quiet, and above us, stars. We talk about our dreams and passions. Then we share our first kiss.

# Conversation Themes

I used to memorize scripts, lines, and PUA routines. But that won't get you far in the long run. I also don't want boring conversations about work and the usual stuff. If you have very similar interests, then that's great you can talk about that. Just be careful you don't trigger her friendzone radar. So instead, I focus on these. I found these themes bring more emotion into the convo, and I don't shoot myself in the foot by giving her ""buddy"" or ""best friend"" vibes.

**What drives your date**‚ÄîProbe how or why they choose to do their work or hobbies. Try to see where their drive and desire are coming from. And engage them there.

**What exhilarates your date**‚ÄîDon‚Äôt make the date too serious. Probe at fun things too. My usual go-to is music. Most people are passionate about certain music. And it's a great jump-off for flirtatious dancing or singing. And no, I'm a terrible dancer/singer. But that doesn't make it any less fun.

# Games

Never underestimate the activities you did for fun at age 10. They just might brighten your dates now.

Think of Games as an add-on to your conversation. Like intermissions or bridges to deeper connection. You can whip them out to break the ice, put on a certain mood (intellectual, playful, flirty, etc.), or even increase physical intimacy. You may use drinking games or Never-have-I-ever, anything fun, really.

# Final Thoughts

My last girlfriend and I were very different people. But with the template above, I learned we were actually in the same phase in life. She had just quit her job to travel abroad. And I had just quit my job to move to a different city. We both uprooted ourselves to go after what we want.

In my experience, being in the same phase in life affects a relationship more than we think.

It went really well (from my point of view) he even asked to see me again and if I would like to see him again, when we were on the date. The whole time he was saying how much fun he was having and made comments like ‚Äúwe should just get married already‚Äù 
So after the date, I didn‚Äôt contact him, but he messaged me the next day and since then he hasn‚Äôt stopped saying how much fun he had and how he would ‚Äúlove‚Äù to see me again. 
In between I did go on a holiday and the whole time I was away he was saying that he couldn‚Äôt wait for me to get back so we could see each other again. 
I‚Äôm just super confused as I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs keeping me at an arms length because on our first date he did mention he‚Äôs had a bad history with his relationships failing due to no independence and he just wants to focus on his job and studying? So I let him know I was very independent and learnt that was something I needed to maintain from my last relationship also failing due to that. After that he seemed way way more into the date and complimenting me the entire time.
Now there have been times where he has asked if I was free a Saturday to hang out and I‚Äôve told him I‚Äôd have to let him know, then he ends up being busy. I‚Äôll take it as him not being interested but he will keep up the interest in messaging me constantly and mentioning how much he wants to see me again? I‚Äôve even put myself out there and asked him if he was free and he‚Äôs said yes but when it comes to the night before or day of it just never happens? Again, I pull away but he starts talking again how much he wants to see me, sending funny videos or flirty stuff? Now I‚Äôve just started assuming he‚Äôs just waiting for a hookup opportunity, which I‚Äôm fine with so I‚Äôve moved to more flirty casual type of texts but now he‚Äôs going as far as saying ‚Äúwe should go see a movie together‚Äù asking how my weekend was and what I did or if I‚Äôm cooking and post it on my story he will reply ‚Äúyou should invite me over for dinner and cook for me and I‚Äôll do the same for you‚Äù 
We talk DAILY and if I don‚Äôt message him all day he will even go as far to double message me. 

What the hell is going on? Why is he acting so keen to see me STILL if he wasn‚Äôt interested? I‚Äôve had dates with other guys in between that I can tell weren‚Äôt going anywhere and none of them have had a problem with just ghosting me or slowing down the communication to the point where we don‚Äôt talk anymore? But he has continued to make the effort to keep it up but he‚Äôs not taking action??? I know actions speak louder than words but I do really think this guy would be so so fun to hang out with again as I had such a good time with him the first time, which is why it‚Äôs so hard to just stop talking to him. Why if he just wanted a booty call, has he not messaged me late at night to come over? He doesn‚Äôt do any of that? If he‚Äôs wanting to see me he will ask me a week in advance but either he will end up having an event he can‚Äôt get out of or I won‚Äôt be available!

I already know all the reasons why someone would cheat and stuff. Not enough affection, chronic depression, just plain out you're an @sshole, etc. But still, WHY!?!

And when the impact of the realization and this weird negative feeling hit, I feel as if I'm now disillusioned with the whole idea of love or the idea of a trustworthy partner in general.

A few examples of my behavior include :  
1. If they are holding a jacket or a bag, I offer to hold them. I don't offer to hold their purse.  
2. I pay for the food/ drinks.   
3. I offer to drive them home or pay for their cab or parking price.  
4. I don't initiate physical contacts when on dates. Never force a kiss..  
5. I am a bit concerned / anxious if they want to drive home past midnight - if they live 50+ kms away.  
6.  I keep asking them if they need anything.  
7. Try not to be pushy / dominating. I align to what they want. Vegan restaurant? Ok. A good bar? Ok. Coffee? Ok.  Whatever works best for them..   
8. When picking a point to meet, I ask them where they would be comfortable meeting and pick a spot that works best for them and not for me.   


What I am observing is that this behavior might be coming of as creepy / desperate in the modern dating situation... It is no longer romantic to be thinking about making life easier for a woman...  I know things change with time.. What was expected a few years ago is considered creepy now-a-days. I am wondering if there are any recommendations on what is considered ""gentleman behavior"" vs what's considered ""creepy"" in the current dating scenario.

We are both 26, both Capricorns, and I am black and he is white. I am queer and nonbinary, and he is straight. He told me he loved me on the very first date, which was also the first time we met in person. I assumed that was a red flag, but he seemed genuine and we DID hit it off pretty well right away. Within a month I found myself saying ""I love you"" back and realized that we were moving fast. To pump the brakes a bit we discussed our ""status"" and agreed that being in a relationship wasn't ideal for either of us right now, and that we should remain open and casual. The sex is bomb and we are genuinely very into each other which is amazing, so things have been going fairly¬†well as they are.

Howwwwwwever.

The problem is that this man also happens to get on my last damn nerves quite often with some of the things he does. In an effort to air out my grievances more concisely, here is a quick list:

He still sucks his thumb (a habit I am trying to get him to stop)

Despite having a decent job, he also regularly sells drugs on the side

He recently paid someone for their urine in order to pass a drug test for a promotion at work

Several of his friends are openly homophobic and also very into drugs

He farts around me a lot and laughs it off with halfhearted apology

He plays World of Warcraft almost everynight until 3 in the morning only to complain about being tired everyday

He doesn't know how to iron

And he likes to wear pajamas as actual clothing, IN PUBLIC

Worst of all though ---and my biggest problem with him--is that he is a sloth. We joke about it often, but it truly gets on my last damn nerves. Often, whenever I sleep over at his place or he sleeps over at mine, he will say ""wake me up early so we can go do XYZ"". Cool. I'm a morning person and I love to get up around 8 or 9 to start my day.¬†

So, I set the alarms. And, everytime without fail, he will groan, roll back over, and continue sleeping for an additional 2 hours, and wallow in bed FAR longer than he initially claimed he wanted to get up. His slothiness often ruins my plans for the day and, even though I¬†enjoy his company, I am still left feeling lazy/unproductive as soon as he leaves.

Aside from all of these issues, he is a very funny and kind soul who sincerely loves and adores me, with a big heart for his friends and family. He is super supportive of my gender identity and life aspirations.¬†

But all of these little things keep adding up!! I fight the urge to end what we have at least once a week. Is it wrong to feel so embarrassed by him in public? Or to say ""I love you"" while also feeling ashamed to claim him as anything beyond a fuck buddy and Netflix companion? Should I end whatever this is entirely (since it HAS only been a few months) and just walk away while it's still early?

Ever since she transferred to his department they have been very flirty with eachother and this has been going on for the past 7 months. She is playfully touchy with him sometimes at work where he has something she wants in her hand and she will start trying to take it away from him by holding his hands and wrapping herself around him. Or she would randomly hold his hand and would play around with his tattoos. She lets him touch her around the body without saying anything. She also gets very jealous if he talks to another girl. They seem to be flirty around throughout the work day.

Earlier today I ran into my ex for the first time since we broke up. 

Back story, we dated for 7 years. He bought a house last year and we planned on having children and getting married. Our break up was a shock to me. Completely blindsided we had just got back from vacation and he broke up with me two days later. He said he hadn‚Äôt loved me in 6 months and was ‚Äútrying‚Äù to get the feelings back and they just weren‚Äôt there. This was 3 months ago. 

We have talked twice on the phone briefly after the break up (two separate occasions) when I sadly begged him to not end the relationship and to see if it was salvageable but he brushed me off. Adding he wanted to be alone and not with anyone and that he‚Äôs not in love with me but has love for me. After that I stopped reaching out. 

I saw him today at a store we both go frequently but both had been avoiding since us ending. I walked in grabbed the items I needed and saw him sitting at the counter. I tapped him on the shoulder and he took a double look, shocked.. lol I asked how he was and he said he was good and talked about his job (he got when we broke up) I asked how our cats were and he joked saying still little s***s and then I proceeded to check out. We exchanged some more words very casual and then at the end I gave him a hug and told him happy early birthday since it‚Äôs in about a week. 

I feel great about the encounter, I actually looked good I‚Äôve also lost 30 pounds since the break up and I held myself together unaware of how our first encounter would go after no contact. I can‚Äôt deny I of course still love him, sad we are no longer together and wishing it could be different but I know I can not force someone to want me. I wonder how he felt about the encounter if he‚Äôs been thinking about it like I am? 

How strange to only hug and briefly catch up after we‚Äôve spent seven years together. I don‚Äôt know. I also don‚Äôt want to damage the progress I‚Äôve made healing during these three months.

More context below. 

My friend has been using dating apps and when she likes a guy a lot she wants to spend a ton of time with him which leads to dates that are 6+ hours. Two other guys from dating apps in the past have told her it‚Äôs too much/too fast, or that the dates don‚Äôt need to be too long. Yet, she continues to do it. What do y‚Äôall think of this? I‚Äôve hinted at her having dates that are too long and have told her to think about it/to take it slow, but maybe I just have a completely different style of dating than her.

The guy I‚Äôm newly seeing right now is very busy. He has a huge exam that he is taking for his career coming up this week (the most important test of his life). He‚Äôs been studying for 10 weeks at least 10 hours/day, 7 days a week he told me. We‚Äôve been on 3 dates  and have been seeing each other for only a little over week (I slept over his place the 3rd date). We have a lot of chemistry and feel very comfortable with each other, spend our time together laughing, discussing deep topics, make out constantly, and talk about our childhoods. We have not had sex, but have essentially done everything but. I told him I don‚Äôt have causal sex which he was understanding of but there is a strong mutual attraction which makes adhering to that personal rule very difficult. We talked about what we were looking for I said down the line a relationship and he said he wasn‚Äôt necessarily looking for a relationship but was open to one. We talked about what we want from a person he said independence, ambition, passion and I said communication and mirrored the traits he said. On our last date he said he was taking a trip during the 2nd week in august so won‚Äôt be available then (and said he wanted to communicate that to me since I said communication was very important to me). Idk whether or not I should take his recent poor texting habits personally as a lack of interest or chalk it up to him being incredibly busy. He takes several hours to respond and recently asked for a rain check for our next date which in person he said would need to be after his exam but never said what day his exam was. In response to his text I simply said sure, good luck with your exam and have a good week (as I assumed he would be too busy to talk this week). He didn‚Äôt respond to that text so I might be getting ghosted but it‚Äôs also not a text that I think requires a response and makes it clear I don‚Äôt plan on hearing from him until next week. Dating is rough I‚Äôm not sure where he stands but I‚Äôll see in a week if I‚Äôm ghosted.
