I really don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm suddenly gay or bisexual and what happened to me. 

The whole last year my love-life was a total mess, I was in love with my best friend *with benefits* (23/f) and suffered pretty much to the point I had huge depression. Till today I sometimes fell like I‚Äôm not over her. 

In addition to this I‚Äôm so confused right now with my sexuality and really don‚Äôt know what to do. The thing is, I didn‚Äôt felt in love with a man or had a crush on a specific man. It was out of the blue that I started thinking when I saw a cute man: ‚ÄûMaybe I‚Äôm gay.‚Äú It wasn‚Äôt like, I want to date that guy or make out with this guy it was really just: ‚ÄûMaybe I‚Äôm gay.‚Äú and it confuses me like hell. I really don‚Äôt know what I want, but I can‚Äôt get over that thought. Until this year my whole life, it wasn‚Äôt something that I thought about at all. I was in love with women and had pretty good relationships with women. I even don‚Äôt think that I get aroused by thinking of men or looking at hot men it‚Äôs more like that the thought ‚ÄûMaybe I‚Äôm gay.‚Äú is coming in my mind. But it comes in my mind so often and even while I look at man who clearly aren‚Äôt attractive. Like way too old man or really dirty ones. Persons I would never ever date trigger this thought.

I life in a community/country that is pretty open to queer people and I‚Äôve a group of friends that would totally be fine with me dating man so I could honestly just go for it. But I can‚Äôt and I don‚Äôt know why, I don‚Äôt even know if this is what I want or if my depressiv brain just messes with me.

I meet A and hit it off, then get rejected because Im looking for someone who is not dating around in the pandemic (dont want to get sick). She is crazy beautiful. She is also a huge flake we always make plans but will cancel last minute everytime. We have same tastes in everything, and talk consistently over the year, in which she has several shitty boyfriends. She might not gf material but I defintely want to casually date her. While she has a bf, she introduces me to B.

B

She is nice but not my type, good friend, study partner for my last semester.
We hit it off and date, and were sexually active, but I break it off before graduation, but we're still friends, all good.

 ok 

I graduate, very proud of myself. Afterwards we met up and celebrate, and I accidently eat an edamame A has already ate (I totally forget, Im an idiot lol). Everyone eventually leaves or went to gamble, but I go home for an hour.

A invites me to come over and we have a great night. The whole time she is keeping distance, says she doesn't want a boyfriend for a while, and we are we are talking about B.  She says she feels a fever coming on (!!!). I gotta wake up in 7 hours, for a family brunch, and prepare for a long road trip. Im not not expecting to kiss her becasue she might be sick, and the vibe was off after talking about B. Im also almost dead tired.

We have a moment to kiss, but I dont take it. I almost wanted to, but I was confused and tired and didn't to get sick, or make it awkard before I leave on a week trip. As she shows me to the door and under her breathe she says she was ""too horny""(?). We make plans to hangout and take roadtrip, after my trip, and take another flight to see a mutual friend.

I see my family all the next day (day 1: I wouldn't be contagious, thank god). A tests positive, I wont test positive for a week but I feel kind of ill and decide to stay. We talk in quarantine says she wishes we could see each other but I dont know if I am positive. Soon, I get REALLY sick, since I hadnt had my booster. I sleep for like 4 days straight. In whish I test positive. 

As soon as she tests negative, she meets someone online across the country and invites them over to stay the weekend. I feel like an idiot. I feel like shit, physically and mentally.

And it‚Äôs a long one so here‚Äôs your warning. Basically I am wanting to know should I call the date off because of how she isn‚Äôt replying, or should I wait things out because she could genuinely be too busy to text back. 

So yes it begins with a ONS, but that doesn‚Äôt matter because what matters, to me at least, was before and after that. I went to the bars with my roommate and ran into my brother out there. Hung out with him and his friends and at one point one of his best friends sisters, she‚Äôs a year younger than I am, either mentioned or something that she thought I was hot. Fast forward to the next bar we were at and her and I are just sitting there talking, and we had a phenomenal connection, like one I‚Äôve never had before with someone. Well we end up making out, and then as we leave she says to my brother ‚ÄúI love your brother‚Äù to which he replies ‚ÄúI know, I‚Äôll see y‚Äôall at the wedding.‚Äù As if he knows something I don‚Äôt or can see something I don‚Äôt. We get to her place and I would have been completely fine just staying the night w/o sex. But that happened anyway. The next morning I tell her I need to leave and as I‚Äôm trying to get up she pulls me back in to make out some more and sleep some more. A little while later I get dressed and she pulls me in again to make out some more before I leave and I get her number and I ask her on a date. She then walked me out and made out some more at the door. Clearly I did something right if she didn‚Äôt want me to leave. We then start texting and plan a date for a Friday three weeks from then because Christmas was the next week, and she works as a night nurse so her schedule changes a lot. Well I really began to like her, although she sucked at replying and taking a day to reply sometimes, but I understood that because we‚Äôre both adults with adult jobs. She apologized for not replying much to which I said it was fine because I knew she was busy but she even recognized she wasn‚Äôt great at talking. This week she is in a wedding and I haven‚Äôt talked to her for some time, again giving her some leeway because her friends are in town. But she can post on her story kinda regularly and not text me back which is confusing. I asked her earlier in the week if we could move our date up because I really just wanted to see her. I suggested some days and she was busy because of the wedding, Friday her friends are still in town so she ‚Äòmight be busy‚Äô and Saturday she said she would try to do something but doesn‚Äôt know if she will be sad from her college football team losing in their bowl game. What I don‚Äôt get is that clearly we had a great connection because others saw it too, she didn‚Äôt want me to leave and then she goes from replying kinda often to almost never. Our date is planned for next Friday and I‚Äôm considering only waiting until next Wednesday and if we don‚Äôt have some decent conversation between then then I‚Äôll call the date off because clearly something is wrong and she is showing no interest out of no where. Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking it because she‚Äôs just with friends and she just forgot to reply to my message, or maybe she genuinely lost interest. But if the latter were the case I‚Äôd want to know why so I don‚Äôt do that again. If someone could give some insight that would be great. 

TL:DR: Met a girl at a bar, had a GREAT connection, she didn‚Äôt want me to leave in the morning, we began texting and the time between replies became longer and longer.

TLDR included at the end.

Met this guy on a dating app. We were in different countries at the time, but we connected almost instantly. Really similar personalities, world views and niche interests; it was seriously uncanny. And I‚Äôm not kidding when I say we talked every single day for almost 3 months. I genuinely liked him.

He complimented me, flirted with me, called me pet names like ‚Äúbb‚Äù and ‚Äúdear‚Äù and we had several deep conversations. We also called, FaceTimed, and watched shows together, so we got to know each other really well for two people who‚Äôd never even met in person. Checking my phone in the morning and talking to him every day felt natural. He even suggested we make a joint playlist with songs that reminded us of each other.

We made a list of things we wanted to do together once we met up in person, which was starting to become a reality as I‚Äôd just moved to his country as an exchange student (not because of him, though, this has been planned in advance for months) so it was a great opportunity to finally meet up in person. He even talked about getting plane tickets to come visit, so I was thrilled. This screamed budding long distance relationship.

However (there‚Äôs always a however) during the fourth month, he started replying less and less often, which I chalked up to him starting a new job. He‚Äôd often take anywhere from 2 to 8+ hours to reply to my messages, and every once in a while he wouldn‚Äôt reply for 1-2 days. Mind you, his job wasn‚Äôt even THAT demanding or high-pressure, and people I talked to concluded that even an ER doctor would have the time to reply more often than he did. 

One day, he let me know he bought a plane ticket to visit his friend, something he‚Äôd told me he‚Äôd been wanting to do for a while, and I was excited because we‚Äôd be geographically closer than before, so he could just fly down to where I was later.

In the meantime, our long, amazing conversations started becoming less and less frequent, which I missed. We stopped calling or watching shows altogether.

At one point, the uncertainty and mixed signals were too much to handle, and I considered asking him what was up, and if he was interested in a relationship in the future (I hadn‚Äôt brought it up earlier before because I didn‚Äôt want to scare him away at the beginning, especially considering he‚Äôd never seen me in person, but 3.5 months of doing all the stuff I mentioned above couldn‚Äôt have made it more obvious) so I finally decided to ask.

His first reply was:

‚ÄúWait, relationship??‚Äù

I ended up finding out that he wasn‚Äôt looking for something long distance, and that he was confused I‚Äôd brought up the topic of a relationship despite all the signs pointing towards one (the flirting, the pet names, deep conversations, written plans for the future, etc)

He also claimed he‚Äôd be happy keeping things as they were before, which I reluctantly agreed to because I genuinely enjoyed talking to him, but then he ended up ghosting me after a while. No goodbye, nothing. 

And that‚Äôs how I got the closure I needed but not the closure I wanted.

If you‚Äôve read the whole thing, I appreciate it.

TLDR; Got really close to a guy I‚Äôd met on a dating app, talked almost every day for for 3 months only to find out that the thought of a relationship hadn‚Äôt even crossed his mind despite his words and actions saying otherwise.

Me and my bf has been online dating for almost a year now. Everything is going so well but the only thing that is bothering me is that he doesnt wanna show his face.

He did turn it once and showed me his face, for like 5 seconds and thats it. Everytime I talk to him about it, he would say he isnt ready to but idk how long should I wait. He said its not because he's uncomfy but he's just insecure. But to be insecure with your own gf that u you've been dating for almost a year is ridiculous if you ask me. And I don't see him making an effort to show me since I never forced him to show his face etc. Idk what to do.. Do I leave him or what T.T

That was in October and everything was fine. Ups and downs ofc but mostly I've felt like I'm really getting over them.

One of the people in our friend group is their best friend since kindergarten so I knew that our breakup meant I lose that friendship as well but I was okay with that. The weird thing is that today, almost 3 months after our breakup their best friend removed me from Instagram which I find very weird. Why this long after? My ex doesn't really open up so I figured maybe they just told her what happened until now but our fight was mostly them insulting me in the worst possible way and me crying.

But I also have a conscience, I dont want to just use her for sex. I had to cancel a date at her house for NYE because we talked about getting a bit freaky..I dont know if I got nervous, cold feet, or just didn't feel like using her for her body. Instead we talked and I said I feel it's too soon, let's get lunch first. 


Right now, if it's up to me, I want to prolong this experience even if I don't have any feelings for her just to experience.

Women my age I usually am instantly turned off by their immaturity and lack of morals. Not to toot my own horn but I'm very mature for my age so I have very little friends at all and mostly keep to myself. I am an empath so it's very difficult to be around people my age when they are usually pretty negative/selfish and or going through so much that it seeps in to my bubble. (not saying older people are perfect but they usually have boundaries).

Honestly I'd love to experience a fling with mature women of course, but I think I'm interested in maybe dating too. Either way... I have had no luck finding any that are SINGLE. Moms I meet (and I say moms because I haven't found an older girl without kids) are usually always married or have tons of kids. I may be interested to experiment but I'm not heartless and I don't want to ruin marriages. I've tried night clubs but I haven't really had any luck there as the ones I find are usually very wholesome and non sexual or non romantic. Ironically.

Some background info on me. I've only been in 4 relationships. My longest was 2 years. Shortest was about 4-5 months. I believe in soulmates. I have an average body, not unhealthy just average skinny look. I am goth and very punky. I'm feminine especially with my style. Easiest way to explain me is Im a goth femboy. I have a job at skyzone which ironically is a gold mine for moms, but they are always married or with a ton of kids so I feel bad asking them about dating. LOL. I am very kinky, and love to be, but I AM A VIRGIN. Saving it for marriage. Yes I have had plenty of opportunities and I turned them down (Previous gfs and one night stand type stuff). My favorite things to do are making videos/editing, streaming, gaming, fashion, shopping and collecting films or going on random spontaneous adventures and road trips!

Him: ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù

Me: ""Does it boost your ego to get me to say yes and then bail on me?""

Him: ""Wtf. No.""

This is when I started feeling like it‚Äôs just another way to bail out on me. Previously, he‚Äôs used a variety of ways. Out of anger, I blocked him right away but I can‚Äôt stop feeling bad and wondering what if he's really sick. The cases of omicron are really increasing where I live and I really like him but I just couldn't handle him bailing on me again. He seemed really excited when we were planning it on Tuesday. Did I do the right thing? Should I add him back? I really don't know what to do ;(""

Everyone in the comments made me feel so guilty to the point of me adding him back and saying sorry.

His response was ""Man. Please. I'm not feeling good."" So I felt really bad and suggested that it could be covid and I offered to drop a COVID test. He just said ""No. It's not COVID. Just not feeling it. Moody.""

I'm at a stage in my life that I know how I've been awkward and weird about wanting to be in a relationship, I honestly think I've obsessed over it in the past just because I've felt so lonely and want someone to spend time with. I'm trying to be better, And im trying to be more honest about it not just for the one's I want in my life but for myself too. The internet can be an amazing tool to find countless amounts of amazingly helpful information, but it can also be used to fuel unhealthy habits. 

I've sent my unrightful share of odd texts and such, All because of a some hormones that make me wanna feel good. My best advice to you guys is to either rub it out and be over with it or let it subside, But whatever you do DO NOT send dm's, texts, pictures, or whatever else you might be thinking about while you're in that mood. You very well may regret it and it doesn't take very long for it to build into a selfloathing pit in your stomach. You can also ruin friendships and even your reputation with just one untastful message.

I feel like I'm partly just venting here, But if anyone can take away from this i hope you get that it's okay to have those feelings and urges but you can't let them control or consume you, They aren't what you should want to be in a relationship for. Having a significant other has to start with polite and honest intentions. You should be looking for someone to get to know, to share in conversations with, to build a healthy relationship with and actually be able to love.

I M27 can't really complain about my life. I have good friends I can rely on, hobbies I enjoy, and a well-paying job in tech. 

But my resolution to finally find my first girlfriend didn't happen again in 2021. I have to watch two couples kissing at the New Year's Eve party tonight. I don't begrudge them their happiness, but as an unkissed virgin I also wish to be desired by a woman and to gain first sexual experiences. 

All I want is a girlfriend with whom I can spend time, go to the movies, theater or museum together, cook, discuss about the world and watch Netflix. Preferably of the nerdy introverted student next door type.

What I have tried to change in 2021:
My work environment, circle of friends and hobbies are unfortunately pretty male-dominated. So I need to look elsewhere.

So I signed up on Bumble and Tinder. I didn't think it would be hard at first. After all, I'm actually not a bad overall package and I don't have huge requirements when it comes to looks. But far from it as an average guy. With better photos and Tinder Premium I managed to get a few likes and matches. But everyone left me with ""the evening with you was nice, but I didn't feel the spark"" after the first or second date. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I tried asking the women for feedback but never got an honest answer. 

In real life, I have tried to go to more events despite the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. However, I continue to have a hard time approaching women as an introvert with slightly autistic traits. Especially since hardly anyone else seems to do that either? At parties and in the disco under the influence of alcohol it went a little better, although there I always have to screen for the type of woman who looks like she was dragged along by girlfriends. These events are actually not my passion.

Is anyone in a similar situation? Or have any more advice on what else I could try? Where can I find you nerdy introverted college girl next door in real life? Wishing you all a healthy new year!

I‚Äôve been in enough therapy for my anxious thought patterns to know it‚Äôs really not healthy to fill in other peoples thoughts like that, but I don‚Äôt know how to stop myself. It is driving me crazy and it causes me so much stress that a big part of me just wants to end things.

I didn‚Äôt even meet a potential friend that lasted. The goal was to find my first-ever relationship. Silly, I know when it comes to online dating. Idk why I thought I would get any luck when my efforts are just as bad in real life. 

For example, many of the guys I run into put on this dramatic facade in an attempt to get sexual pleasure from me. Knowing fully what my intentions are when I make them very clear. Then their lies catch up, and their true self starts to show. When it happens, it almost feels sinister; it‚Äôs kind of disturbing. I just needed a mental break. 

However, there is one guy [23M] I‚Äôm talking to who‚Äôs my last effort before I focus on myself. My hopes aren‚Äôt high bc like I stated before, his facade is showing. I caught feelings for him from the first phone call. We talked for hours and hours ever since. He‚Äôs a manager for a restaurant and never has time for me. When we chat, it‚Äôs always late at night. We canceled the first date I planned due to this. We both have busy lives, so I try not to take it as a red flag. 

He‚Äôs a sweetheart and takes note of every word I say. He‚Äôs a genuine Cancer guy of few words. He states he‚Äôs an introvert like me, doesn‚Äôt do much, and is at a stage of life where he‚Äôs only dating for potential marriage. However, when he talks about his past life, he‚Äôs far from introverted, in my opinion. He‚Äôs from a city up north that‚Äôs plagued with violence.
Consequently, he‚Äôs a product of his environment and made some bad decisions he regrets. Not bad enough for jail time and stuff. Noting how the people in his life at the time were bad influences, and he‚Äôs cut ties to become better. In our first phone chat, he felt comfortable enough to talk to me about his brother passing due to gun violence very recently and his failed relationship/engagement with his ex of 6+ yrs. He seems like a guy who is hurting, you know. 

I love hearing his voice, and we literally talk about our lives and anime all day. Just through the phone, I feel like I‚Äôm lying on his chest having a conversation. He‚Äôs very consistent, and I really like him. I liked him so much that when I first sensed we were distancing, I popped up at his job, lmao. I was so emotional about it to the point of tears! I was trying to give whatever we had going on my all, you know! He was like my last hoorah before I chilled out. I seriously desired a relationship. 
But, anywho, I confessed my feelings for him like a dummy! It hasn‚Äôt even been a flipping month yet. He gave me free food and reassurance that he liked me too, which was nice. 

Despite this, the phone call we had the next day made me regret all of that. The conversation was going well until he casually told me has a girl coming over that night bc of family troubles. Then he asks me how I feel about casual dating; if that doesn‚Äôt scream a red flag idk what does! Like, I just told him I have feelings for him, and he says that shit! I instantly lost interest and thought he did too. Fast forward two days later, he‚Äôs blasting my phone as if that convo never happened and asking when I‚Äôm available for a date. I told him the last convo rubbed me the wrong way, and he gave up trying to explain himself and said he‚Äôd call me back. My emotions are just on a roller coaster rn. Am I tripping that I feel hurt? Should I ignore the previous convo and go the date? Is he playing with me? I‚Äôm just so sick of the mental stress that ‚Äúdating‚Äù is putting me through. I am too sensitive for this crap.

If the pictures on my profile were of me doing what I do for a living, doing what I do as a hobby, doing what I do socially among friends, and doing what I do to relax, I'd have a profile with pictures of me sitting at the computer, sitting at the computer, sitting at the computer, and sitting on the couch (to spice things up a bit).

I have hobbies and passions that I'd be happy to share and talk about, but they all take place in front of a keyboard-- it's difficult to make that seem as exciting or glamorous as it is to me.

Me and this girl have been dating for about 6 months now. We‚Äôve had some on/off moments that have only lasted briefly however our relationship has been very intense and passionate during its course. We‚Äôve gone out on dates, have slept together numerous times. She‚Äôs even met a few of my friends and immediate family that I live with. Her friends and family know of me and have even been acquainted with me through FaceTime or over the phone.

Several issues that we‚Äôve run into in the past (almost) always involve my issues with trust in her. I always assume the worst in a relationship, either that she doesn‚Äôt love me as much as she says or she isn‚Äôt being faithful towards me.

This past week she‚Äôs been over my house with me spending the night and everything has been fine up until she was getting ready to leave. She stays an hour away from where I reside and she isn‚Äôt driving her vehicle at the moment so she asks one of her best friends to give her a ride home. Her friend is a straight male that she‚Äôs been friends with since high school. He‚Äôs been there during her previous relationship and according to her there hasn‚Äôt been any issues from her ex regarding their friendship.

The day after Christmas her and her friend went to go see the new Matrix film which she told me she was going to go see with her friend however it wasn‚Äôt until after she got home from being at my house this week that I find out that it‚Äôs her straight guy best friend that both took her out to the movies and dropped her off at home. She has three BFs apparently. One straight, one gay, and one bisexual. I was under the impression that it was her gay best friend being that she always mentions that person rather than her straight BF. 

She says that since HS this person (straight BF) has NEVER tried to hit on her or flirt NOT ONCE and the relationship is strictly platonic.

Right now I feel as though she is being deceptive and hiding stuff from the relationship and any time we try to talk about it it always devolves into an argument where either side has to be on defense. Right now I don‚Äôt know how to feel about her having a guy BF especially considering that I was unaware of his existence up until this point.

Should I confront him on New Years Eve?


I have been friends with my college friend, A, for 3 years. I'm not gonna lie I've always found him attractive but he is kind of out of my league looks wise. I'm thin but below average attractive facially, never had male attention in my life and when I go out with female friends I'm a ghost. My life has been full of urequited crushes for years and thats how its going to be for the rest of my life, I don't think I will ever settle down due to looks requirements most guys have for their GF/wife.

I also believe he is out of my league because he probably has a lot of experience with women in his life yadayada.

Beginning of this year, with distance education and everything being closed down, I started talking to him more. We would chat on Snapchat, he would help me with school assignments, we would play LoL and other games and talk on Discord etc. It was funny. We would also have talks about politics and other stuff that were deeper. Suddenly this summer he asks me out on lunch. I can't go but come up with another time and date, and another activity. We go out to play minigolf, I meet his friends, a couple of weeks later we go out and play pool and have drinks etc. None of this is labeled dates. Before we meet up for pool he sends me a Snapchat selfie with lots of heart emojis. I have a bad feeling of it and don't respond or mention it.

Come september, he starts working at a bar/resturant for students and asks me to come there at his shift. I went there and talked to him for a while, it felt like he wanted to show off his bartender knowledge or something. The next day later that night at around 11-12 PM he texts me asking me to come there again but I'm already in bed so I can't.

The following months we are still writing to each other regularly, but the texts are being more suggestive and more flirty in tone. I go on with it, because this is the first time a hot dude is giving me any attention. However, one thing happens in school that makes me freak out about his intentions. He sits next to his friend and I walk past them and can hear his friend whisper my name in a low tone, but he probably didn't realize I heard it. This is when I'm thinking holy shit they are discussing me as a sexual conquest behind my back and laughing at me, because why else would his friend tease me in front of him?

However I also notice he is starting to play games as I disengage and go cold on him and hang out with other male friends. He asks curiously who I'm with when he sees my Snapchat stories of me hanging out with other guys. He later sends a pic of him and some other girl in the bar (probably his coworker), when otherwise he NEVER mentions other women in front me, never ever. Not even if I ask him. He starts flirting by calling me sweetie but backtracks when I ask if he is joking. Once I told him he is on my best friend list on Snapchat and he responded by sending a pic of him doing a heart with his hands and writing under ""best friends ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"" like its funny and I'm a moron. 

He also mentioned he was at a bar event he knows I like saying he lost in a music quiz and I was like so you went without inviting me? :( And he was like hehe did you want to? And I was like yeah and he replied true, ill give you my exam notes as an apology.
So he knows I like him and is teasing me like this? Not funny

He acts cold and hot but ALWAYS reaches out through Snapchat if I don't write anything to him for 1-2 days. Like yesterday he sent a pic of his cat asking me what I thought of it, after I had not sent anything for days. Stuff like that.


I'm meeting up with him on New Years Eve because I have to get some notes for my exam and I'm planning to confront him about his behavior and then cut him off. What should I say and how should I frame it?

I (25m) matched online with a person (26F) a few days ago. Exchanged numbers and had vague plans to meet. I was exchanging banter and then I got the most unexpected reply. (See link to screenshot)

Was I way out of line or does she just have a fragile ego? I would have never expected somebody to take this so seriously or so personally. 

I followed up by stating that it was an honestly harmless joke and I obviously was never going actually do it (even if I did, it's pretty harmless).
