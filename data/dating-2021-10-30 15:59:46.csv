0,qjal1n,1635627899,Low body count because of the religious influence?,"Pretty much of all my romantic stuff happened in the military and university. Before and after, not much.

I was brainwashed by an evangelical cult when I was between 18~20. They emphasized the swift punishment of God. To make a long story short I lost mine at the age of 26 at a brothel not to far from where I was stationed. And girls jumped over me because they thought I was some sort of exotic stranger because I am a poc immigrant. 

And a couple of girls during my university years after military. Then...nothing except for at a local strip joint which has been a meeting point between professional girls and their clients. Yes, they pay off local cops. 

I managed to find some financial stability in 2016. But my social skill was severely atrophied partly due to my bipolar medication. Just about two weeks ago I switched to a different medication which boosted my motivation to socialize more.

Bur my body count beside hookers is in the single digit at the age of 45. I feel devastated, especially because I am in LA which is a dating war one.

I managed to get a connection to the entertainment industry gatherings held regularly. And I joined a hiking group to socialize. It's 5 years too late.

This makes me worried about all the retroactive jealousy and damaged self esteem.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qjal1n/low_body_count_because_of_the_religious_influence/
1,qjalts,1635627967,I can't get my head around extrovert women using OLD,"From time to time I get some dates from OLD and the woman seems to be extrovert.

They like to go out a lot, does not like work from home, have many friends, etc.

What I can't get my head off is why this woman single and why they use OLD.

Assuming OLD is a bad experience for women and real life meatings is favorable how come an extrovert woman who meets many people need OLD?

The statistics does not make sense to me. Given enough time and human interactions any extrovert woman should easily find a date without the need of OLD.

3,qjasbf,1635628530,Does it make sense for a guy to have standards anymore?,"When I say this I’m barring attractive guys that have a constant flow of women.

So for a guy like me who has never had a girl interested in him, does it make sense for me to have standards.

As much as everyone says you have to be happy alone, which isn’t wrong I know I’d be happier in a relationship than if I died never knowing what it’s like to experience romantic love. According to my track record of 20 years old and not even a single date, I’m likely going to die alone.

So when I’m looking for women to maybe get to know and date, is it even logical for me to have standards? I’m not just talking about appearance, I’m talking about the way they treat me. If I want to be with someone, it might be hard to find someone who will treat me well, and considering no girl wants me now, it might be impossible for me, so I would have to settle if I wanted someone and that’d be with someone who treats me bad.

Even with things like hygiene. Girls that have good hygiene and take care of their bodies and health don’t want me, so doesn’t it make more sense just to be with someone with and hygiene if I don’t want to die alone?

For me(20F), it took almost three months. I tried to break up once and we decided to try again but it made me die inside more. While I liked his company,I didn’t want him as my partner anymore and anything related to sexual stuff begun to seem like a chore.

Apparently lots of dudes think women are attracted to men who act like assholes, when girl A is actually attracted to the opposite (don't assume I am a /r/niceguy, I am brutally honest when it's required, and honest and straightforward when it's not. I 70 percent don't care about the possibility of ending up alone.). I also found out we are on the same page with love language; she's super big on physical touch, which I absolutely love. She's also super into science fiction movies, which I've never encountered before with a woman before, and she introduced me to a hardcore waitress at the club who is super into science fiction books and Renaissance Fair type stuff as well, so I may have not only scored a potential girlfriend, but a new friend as well. Still taking things one step at a time and being cautious with how I interact with girl A so as not to get overly optimistic, but we're planning to meet up again in a week and see what happens at a bar, and go to a drag show at some point as well since she's never been to one.  She also agreed to text me again outside the club and confirm plans for next week, and check in to see how I'm doing. I don't want to get my hopes up too much but I think I found the one y'all. I'm excited to see what happens in the future.

27,qjccbt,1635633562,Is this normal behaviour?,"Short background:

I knew this girl (f27) for a pretty long time online and we spoke alot but couldn't meet in a long time because of the distance. We used to flirt a little bit over phone and face time. When we finally decided to meet she wanted it not to be a traditional date setting, because of her previous bad dating experiences and her self proclaimed fear of intimacy and her need to take it slowly. I don't have lots of dating experience and also want to take it slowly to begin with, so we agreed on this. It felt good for both of us to lower the pressure.

Story:

I travelled far to a place close to hers where we met. We hung out for 8 hours and had the best of times. Given what we had agreed on, i did intentionally not make any attempts on her other than some small compliment. However as the hours past her behavior drifted away from our agreement and she started to become close and flirted the heck out of me. (This was not under alcohol). She was spinning around me, touching me, pushing me as she joked with me, put her fingers on my neck, leaning towards me, spontaneously throwing her arms around me hugging me very intensely, putting her arm around me as we walked, looking deeply into my eyes alot etc. I found it very nice but it also got me confused given what we had talked about before. I interpreted this as she was interested in me and liked me. When we left she once again hugged me intensely and for a long time.

Some days past by and i decided to call her. On the phone she was ice cold. She nervously ran on to talk about her job immediately and it felt like she didn’t even want to recognize that we had met. I tried to redirect the conversation as i was curious about how she perceived it. I thanked her for the time and said it was a pleasure meeting her. Her only reply was ”oh ok, how good”, and then proceeded to talk about the city we were in. I said that we would have to meet again to do all the things that we talked about this time but didn’t have time for. She didn’t really answer that. She then said that it was nice ”not being any different from speaking on the phone”. Like what!? She literally flirted the heck out of me and was very physical. I told her that i perceived some mixed signals referring to her behavior around me. She said that she was just experimenting to see if it was something there, but as soon as she got home she felt nothing. She stated that it probably had nothing to do with me. She told me that she had a crush on me some 2 months ago, but then had developed feelings for her ex and was recently rejected and heartbroken. However during our date she told me that she was going to her ex for a birthday party later the same weekend and that they had such a good friend relation now. I hadn’t heard anything about that story before either, during our plentiful calls. So i don’t know what to believe.

This got me kinda hurt as i started to really like her after our date. I also feel confused and upset as i think this was dishonest. Is this normal behaviour? Or why do people even act like this? Am i overreacting? Just some second opinion on this would be appreciated. I think i'm more confused than anything.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qjccbt/is_this_normal_behaviour/
28,qjcdkg,1635633668,A story about groceries,"So I was dating this person I met on tinder last summer, called a quits about two-ish weeks ago. So I go over to their apartment to hangout with them but then she tells me she needs to go and get groceries. I tell her we can take my car but she insist on walking. So we walk the mile to the store, which isn’t terrible but it’s also like 90 degrees, she starts filling the cart, even gets a watermelon and still believes walking was the best option. It’s not until we get outside that she says “maybe we should have taken your car”. I end up having to walk with the watermelon, my arms are on fire after carrying it along with 4 other bags a mile in this summer heat. We’re like 30 feet from her apartment door when my arms give out and drop the watermelon. What’s worse is she didn’t bother to clean it up and wanted to just leave it there in front of someone else’s yard. 

This was just one of many stupid ass things, like it wasn’t the worst but it was really stupid and I should have looked at a lot of shot as red flags but stuck it out.

29,qjcfd8,1635633834,I Had To Break Up With My Girlfriend,"I (22M) really loved this woman (F22) I've dated for nearly a year now. But, it's gotten too stressful to maintain and here's why. When I first got into a relationship with her, she'd told me about her past abuses from ex boyfriends and the molestation she received from her previous ex. I've listened to her, and comforted her as much as possible on this. We live over 100 miles apart, so it's a long distance relationship. We really liked each other when I first came over to her home back in last December after talking to her on the phone and on a dating app. We hit it off, and things are going very well. Then, when she came over to visit me and my brother over in our apartment in March, my brother immediately did not like her. He didn't say anything rude to her, but it was made obvious to her.  Then, she looked through my phone the next morning while I was showering and locked me out of my own room.

When she finally opened the door, she saw a long list of acquaintances and friends who were female and started accusing me of cheating. I told her that these were people I'm friends, acquaintances to, or hardly know them at all. Then, when she left the apartment, she kept asking what my younger brother really thought about her, and I spilled the beans because I'm a brutally honest person, I guess. She gets upset and a grudge forms between the two and her insecurities start to build up from her past significantly. She'd ask me constantly if I was going to leave her, or if I was just using her for sex, which I've explained many times to her that that is not how I feel. Those are things she'd even tell me well before she met my brother. I'd sometimes travel a couple of hours just to come sleep with her and spend time with her family during the school week and during the summer, she'd come over more often. Now, at this point in time, the feud had gotten so bad between her and my brother that she started asking personal questions about my brother, (18M), like why isn't he paying more in rent, or that her car was somehow better than his because hers was brand new and that his was a used car, stupid shit like that. She started saying that I loved my brother more than her, and I felt she'd cornered me into an awful scenario. Keep in mind that I'm on the autism spectrum, and I do not react well to stress or anxiety most of the time, and she understands this very well. This made me realize that no matter the fact I'd call and text her every day, and how I'd take her on dates, tell her she's amazing, come visit her when she's over 100 miles on days where I felt comfortable doing so, no matter how many times I'd convince her to seek therapy or other professional help for her sexual and relationship abuses, she never worked on herself and used me to distract herself from her emotional baggage. 

I couldn't take it any longer when I've got a part-time, on the autism spectrum, go to college as a physics, and have my own apartment. I just hope I'm not in the wrong here by breaking up with her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qjcfd8/i_had_to_break_up_with_my_girlfriend/

We didn’t text eachother for 2 days after that and I wanted to text him, so I did. I asked him how he was and that i’ve been thinking of him. He replied like 7 hours later, saying that everything is good, getting ready for halloween, and that he has been thinking of mee to, and said hope you are allright. I felt like the text was kind of dry, but answered if he was going out? It’s been almost a day and he didn’t text back yet. Im kind of confused, and I don’t know if I should wait a couple of days to see if he texts back or talks to me, or should I wait a few days and ask him how’s everything and see how’s his reaction. And should I ask him if everything is alright between us if he takes long to answer back and feel like his response is a bit dry? Mind, im a super anxious person, so maybe im just making my head. However, let me know what you guys think and maybe give me some advice? Thank you! :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qjci5v/im_kind_of_confused_and_not_sure_what_to_do/
31,qjcjsn,1635634265,Am I wrong or?,"So I will preface this by saying, I have OCD and it is triggered severely at times. This has caused me to be very untrusting of my partner (even though he’s given me no reason to not trust him). I’ve been recently just going through his phone and he allows it and normally doesn’t say anything. He’ll freely give it up. 

Today, I was triggered and walked in the house and he was doing something on the phone. I said “oh don’t delete anything” and he responded with “I’m not deleting anything” and I said “well let me see”. So he showed it to me but there was nothing. I kinda kept insinuating that there was something and he eventually said “you know what? Here” and shoved the phone into my hands/chest. (I was standing up and he was sitting)

Monday: We were talking about school back then, what we were up to now and then he sent over his number and said let’s text on there since he doesn’t check the dating app often.

Tuesday: So far so good! I thought the situation was so cute and I was excited. We texted a bit throughout the next day about what we do for work and other things we do during the day and I said to let me know if he’s ever free because it would be fun to catch up in person sometime.

Once again, so far so good, now I’m even more excited lol. We talk about our availability a little bit, he said he wasn’t sure if he would be around this weekend but that he’d know by Thursday. 

Friday evening: he texts me that he’s staying in town for the weekend and busy Saturday morning but free after that. I was a little annoyed about how long it took to get an answer but I was still excited regardless. I said that I also had something in the morning but I was free after 12pm.

33,qjcmfr,1635634517,Not sure I'm getting the timing right for asking a girl out,"For context, I'm a decently handsome dude but nothing crazy. I have room for improvement, specially in the physical and self-esteem area. My doubts refer to women I meet on a regular basis particularly, not to casual encounters with random people.

So, the matter is: despite being the general consensus, I feel that sometimes asking a girl out quickly can be mostly a 10-90 bet. I'm not the type who usually gets deep in conversation. I talk the small talk quite a bit before I get comfortable. What I try to say is that I don't tend to make a strong first impression rather than being well-dressed and classy.

On the other hand, being ""too pacient"" can easily fall into friendzone territory, and having ruined many good opportunities because of this approach, I'm not willing to do it again.

However, is there a middle ground to test the waters? Should I begin meeting her in group gatherings to break the ice and work from there?

For context, we only dated for 3 months but went on probably 17 or so dates. He was the one that broke up with me and it felt like it came out of nowhere - we had a great date night on a Saturday night, he stayed at my place and left Sunday afternoon after we made banana bread and had coffee. He had made plans for us for later that week and the following week then he called out of nowhere on Monday to say he decided we shouldn’t continue seeing each other because of the usual “I’ve decided I’m not in a place for a relationship”. I was gutted.

It’s been almost 4 weeks since we last spoke and we had a closure talk that ended ok. I noticed though that he didn’t unfollow/unadd me on Instagram which felt odd since he was the one doing the dumping. I didn’t unadd him myself as it felt a bit petty since we ended on ok terms I guess. Anyways, pretty much the week after the break up I tried to move on and start posting to my stories maybe twice a week. He’s always the first to watch. I noticed he didn’t start posting again until this week and I instantly muted because it’s still fresh and hurts. But what gives?! Why is he viewing my stories pretty much within the first 30mins of me posting. It feels so much more confusing and hurtful.

One time I told her like I thought she liked me bc she was touchy and stuff when we were at a party, but she said the alcohol just got to her.

I hadn’t seen her in like a year or so bc of covid and I saw her at the party, said hi, tried to play it cool, but once she came outside we somehow started talking and joking around. I honestly think she’s cute and she’s my type and I’m drunk snd at s party, so a little flirting and what not doesn’t hurt anybody.

We mostly just joked around and take videos of each other, it’s cool and all. She would try to make fun of me and I’d squeeze her thigh and she’d keep making fun of me, and I think it’s just fun teasing. 

When I was there she told me that she was actually really looking forward to see me and she went on about something but I forgot what she exactly said.

At the end of the night she walked me to my car and I gave her a hug goodbye and like even though she has a bf, and she said she didn’t like me, I’ll just take it for what it is, which is just maybe two people horsing around in the moment.

Why not admit something (however small) hurt you do we can resolve the issue and move past it or end things if we can’t come to an agreement?

For example, (I understand not everyone would agree) I have an *”active”* social life, if it bothers the person I’m dating, I want them to say something. I don’t drink but I do go out a lot and have fun. 

Nothing disrespectful but when me and my friends go out we don’t sit in the corner of the party/bar/club. We get dressed up, dance, socialise and someone ends up posting it. If you (as someone who’s interested in me) are bothered to that extent, is it that hard to tell me? 

I don’t understand how being moody and acting petty towards me would resolve anything. Sure your ego will hell but you’re still upset.

53,qjdtl1,1635638672,Sexual Intimacy Issues with Girlfriend,"I (24M) have been dating my girlfriend (19F) for a few months now. We met at our office. She had a crush on me. She asked me out. We went on a few dates and eventually got into a relationship.

Now, this is the first relationship for her. She's just had distant crushes before. Whereas I've been in both serious and casual relationships before. Our kiss was the first ever kiss for her of her life.

Initially she used to tell me after our first kiss that she was scared. Eventually she started trusting me more and felt safe with my touches.

We haven't had sex( and I've never forced or pressured her). We've just discussed it.

We've gone till the third base (fingering+oral) but we stopped afterwards due to various reasons (lack of time/circumstances etc)
But she used to tease me around that if we get enough time ""she'll know she'll end up wanting to have sex"" or she teases me like ""I thought you'll go further"".

She comes from a conservative family and our nation in general has a taboo attached to sex and women's virginity in general.

She has told her parents about me and they're fine with us dating. However, last week, her mother discussed with her ""Whether you've done something with your boyfriend"" and proceeded to give a talk about how ""it's not the right age, etc"".


Now frankly I've never made my girlfriend feel uncomfortable or do something which I know she doesn't feel comfortable.

However, I've gotten enough hints that she was sexually willing. However, after the talk with her mother she started having doubts. Not just for sex but even for things we've already done before (fingering etc).

She tells me she still loves it but she's trying to curb those thoughts.

I've been trying to tell her ""Do what makes you comfortable but also don't start thinking these are bad just because elders tell us"". I love her and have no intention to force her or ditch her.

However, the fear of Sexual Intimacy, if stretched, might cause issues. Specially if she has second thoughts on stuff we've already done. I'll be fine if she doesn't want to do it because she doesn't like it. However, forcing to not do it because parents think it's wrong causes issues.

How should I balance this issue? I want to make a fine between telling her to trust her gut on what she feels comfortable and not forcefully stop herself while not coming off as someone who is talking his way to get into the bed (because I'll always want something fun done consensually).

When she does meet me, she says she can't stop herself from touching me but her mother's thoughts start making her doubt her morals.  

Would time be able to sort things out?

I am actually new to Reddit and have never posted so please excuse any lack of decorum. I think I just need to vent and this is literally the only space I have…

I (28f) just got out of a three year relationship. I am trying so hard to get back out there but it feels like there is no good way to meet people anymore…so I turned to dating apps. 

Oh my goodness. Never in my life have I ever felt so worthless. I don’t think I’m unattractive. A solid 7 for sure, maybe even and 8 with the right style. But the girls on these apps are 12s (a male friend of mine let me see his account.) I am competing against literal models. Even when I do match and start a conversation, I have never once heard back…

I also feel like everyone is looking for a travel partner with major ambitions and an active lifestyle…I am absurdly normal. I want normal things. I want someone who will watch AFV under a fuzzy blanket and create a pro con list about pasta or tacos for dinner…

It’s just made me realize that I’m. I don’t know. I’m literally nothing. No one in their right mind would pick me in this context when they could swipe on a yoga instructor looking for a plus one on her trip to Spain next summer…

I know this post sounds so whiny and pathetic. Maybe that’s why this is the only place I felt comfortable putting it. But seriously. I’m gutted about my prospects and I’m suddenly and overwhelmingly aware of how uninteresting I am…I feel hopeless. Worthless.

I have been wanting to date seriously because I am about to turn 30 and want to get married. I’m aiming for a fulfilling relationship and intimacy is very important to me but also attracted to my partner. That’s all I’ve ever really asked for. 

I have noticed a lot of people saying, “What is going on with dating and why does it seem like no one is willing to be vulnerable enough to give a real relationship a try when they meet someone they click with. Then suddenly, you will notice they are into you one day and then the next day be distant. 

I have had enough of being the one who has to do all the work and always assumed that role when talking to someone new. I have always been met with no effort and been the one to have to keep the conversation going. 

Even in assuming that role, I always get people who do not give you anything. They will let you sit there and give all the effort like it’s some confidence booster to them. And then keep the conversation very dry. If I back off even just a little bit, I will never hear from them and the conversation will dry up. Most of the time, the conversation dries up after the first day of texting. 

All I do is ask about them. They never ask about me and don’t seem to care about me. They are just entertaining the thought and then seem to move on without any remorse. It’s every single person I have talked to. 

I stopped looking altogether because I have tried everything and in the end, I felt like I wasn’t being myself when I took advice from others. I have come on to forums like this and took their advice. I believed the problem was me because everything I asked advice for didn’t work and left me feeling like there was something wrong about me. 

And I would mention the fact that I only ever ask questions about the other person. I never double text. I try to give it time to get to know them and to try to come across as confident as possible. 

But apparently to Reddit, asking questions like: “What kind of hobbies do you enjoy” shows that I am too codependent, desperate, too easy, and ingenuine of me and I have to change every single thing of me to have better dating life. Okay??? Since when did asking questions become unattractive and so repelling to so many people? 

I see why so many people want to give up and have so many of the same issues. Dating is very tedious and I just find everyone are not worth my time.

67,qjenaz,1635641635,"30M, never had success at dating. Starting to realize I have an unapproachable aura.","ignore username, its a throwaway acc.

I'm your store bread virgin fresh wizard graduate guy who never had luck with women, but I also never really tried. I had grand total of two dates during university and later two from OLD, they were all the same deal, we chatted, talked, it was nice but zero romantic or intimate atmosphere, got ghosted afterwards. On OLD my luck comes and wanes but I pretty much never match with anyone I find truly attractive to me.

Frankly not there or anywhere else I felt anyone is interested me romantically. I get it you arent supposed to get married after the first, but I never felt a spark or deeper interest and the feeling was I assume mutual. But I also have a very low sample number (other people have this much dates in a month) so it'd be stupid for me to make wide judgements. But in general coming from my interactions with women, my impression has been that no one ever tries to get closer to me, and vice-versa I never try to approach women. This stems from long list of self esteem issues - but contrary to what some might judge just reading this, I'm a fairly social dude who made conscious effort to expand my circles during college and after, so I get invited out fairly often, I have plenty of friends, pretty close ones too, I have my share of hobbies, I live on my own from a decent income in a large city, I regularly exercise yadda yadda, from outside I have everything reasonable and I think (in fact, know) several of my friends don't quite get what am I'm missing that they never see me with girls.

This summer on two occasions at separate festivals I had good friends girlfriends come up to me and straight out ask why am I not approaching women? While I'm deeply insecure about how I look I'm apparently not ugly, and I even had people tell me I should be a radio host with my voice lol (on the contrary many many years ago a girl slipped out a less than nice remark on my voice which made me feel bad about it for years).

But it's all so pointless if you don't act right? And after a recent tinder profile review, plus other half-infos I picked up over the years and just introspection, I'm starting to accept I have a vibe thats just not attractive. Its not bad per se, but boringly neutral. Not just my look but my act too. You know those guys who sure, are there but not in the zone? Thats that like to talk and do stuff but it all just feels so forced or selfish? Who don't feel natural? Those that are loud and quickly feel too much?Yeah I think that's me. But where do I go now that I realized my whole emanation is so unattractive? When your very being is so-so? And it feeds back on you like a death spiral, you feel no connection so you feel like, why bother? All my effort would come off as forced, inexperienced, weak. Even if I try, they won't like me.

It feels so trapped. Like, it doesn't matter if you self improve so many 'stats', you think you too will change but you don't. Fuck, I felt exactly the same 10 years ago, I'm still at square one, amazing. It sadly neatly explains why despite putting myself out so much, I never had the numbers smile on me, since i'm constantly multiplying my chances with a big fucking zero.

But the burning desire for a relationship pushes me to try.,"I (m27) don’t know if this is a vent, a discussion or any other flair. I can’t imagine I’m the only person feeling this way. A few years ago I got my heart absolutely obliterated, I went through the depression, a couple meaningless flings, LOTS of booze and drugs. Today I’m in the best place I’ve been in awhile, I’m sober from drugs and the drinking isn’t a problem, a few beers on the weekend. 

Here’s the meat and potatoes of the post, the process is just so daunting. First you have to find someone who meets your standards that alone is a strenuous task, mind you my standards aren’t even *that* high. At 27 I know what I want, marriage and kids but I’m in that position where I know I can’t just jump into a step daddy role. I eventually want kids but know I couldn’t do it right away and I would never ask a woman to do the same if the roles were reversed. 

So, you find someone then you have to “run game.” The thing is I don’t have any game left, it’s just exhausting. People often say “they don’t feel anything” when I go out with them. I don’t know how to make someone feel something. Like what am I supposed to do? You tell me about yourself, I tell you about me. I don’t know what questions to ask. 

Just typing this I’m exhausted. I have one good relationship left in me and the process to even get there is so daunting I don’t even know if I’ll ever get there.

96,qjgmkl,1635648996,People please stop doing this,"I matched with this girl on Hinge a few weeks ago and we hit it off in our text convos. The only issue was that she kind of took a while to respond which can be annoying but I didn't have much of an issue with it cause she always responded. The only thing is that obviously when someone takes a while to respond it's hard to get a real text chain started.

Anyways long story short we were texting for a week. She got into some pretty personal stuff and overall we had a great convo. Normally I'd ask a girl out after a few days but in this case because of the long response times I thought I should give it some more time because I didn't want to rush into things if we've barely spoken to each other. I asked her out after a week and then she just never respond and I'm like wtf.

I've been ghosted before and this exact circumstance has happened to me before but I just don't understand why you just want to waste both of our time. Seriously, just don't match with me if you're going to talk to me for a while and then ghost me once I ask you out. The whole point of dating apps is for us to talk and then lead to one of us asking each other out. I understand you might not be interested but then just say that. People really need to stop hiding behind their phones instead of actually saying no. I don't care if you're afraid to hurt someone feelings by saying no, in my opinion it's much worse to just not answer because at the point your not even respecting the other person.

Like I said this has happened to me many times before. I've come to the realization that for whatever reason, majority of the girls I deal with can't answer a simple yes or no question (I'm sure that guys do this to girls too but it's so frustrating). For example, it annoys me when I ask a girl out and she never answers. Just have the courtesy to say no. It's so disrespectful to just ignore the other person when they built up the courage to ask you out. At least just say no.

Another case that was really bothersome to me was when the first girl I asked out said yes to a date and then I never heard from her again. I was so excited to be going on my first date and then nope! Again a simple yes or no question. I'm completely fine if a girl tells me sorry I don't like you or if they come up with some pretty obvious bs. That way I have my answer and I can move on. But when you either say yes and then don't follow through or don't respond at all it's just so frustrating and disrespectful. If I have the guts to ask you out then have the courtesy to tell me no.

Like for example this one girl I asked out told me I'm so flattered but I have a boyfriend. Long story short she didn't have a boyfriend she was actually trying to hook up with my friend. I had no problem with this because even though she lied she was straight to the point. Meanwhile, a lot of the other girls I ask out either lead me on or never respond. 

Anyways, this post is a lot longer than I expected it to be but long story short if someone has the courage to ask you out have the decency to actually say no to them.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qjgmkl/people_please_stop_doing_this/
