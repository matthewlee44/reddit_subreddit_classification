But there are a few things I‚Äôm concerned about.

1. She mentioned a few stories of guys hitting on her in the past (who she rejected) and talked a bit about her ex-boyfriend (not good things about him). Is this a bad sign she‚Äôs talking about other guys around me?

2. There wasn‚Äôt a lot of touching / real flirting during the date. We hugged at the start and end, but not a lot of touching from her or me during the date

3. I‚Äôm paranoid if she sees me as a friend and not a date. I never established at any point that it was a date before. I just said we should get coffee or food and we ended up 1-on-1 at a cafe.

4. There is a 3-4 year age gap between us. I‚Äôm a senior in college and she is a freshman. She said she loves going to bars and clubs, and I‚Äôm afraid it will be difficult to start a sustainable relationship since she‚Äôs a freshman in college and wants to explore and go out.

Any common hobbies?

I have many strengths, I am careful and conscientious, I don't let go of every little detail, I often help other children in my study life, and I am also a little helper to my teachers. I also have an understanding heart and always think of others. In addition to these strengths, I also have some weaknesses, such as I am not brave enough, a little timid, sometimes slow to do things.

I'm a bit shy and have had no single male friends in my friend groups, b. used to have issues with self confidence but am getting better due to therapy, and c. the few men I went on dates with I didn't really feel a spark for or vice versa.

Reasons being that I was very nose to the grindstone in college, started my career ASAP and hustled to pay off all my students loans (did so in a year), and am now still living at home but do all the home maintenance/yard work. I know how to replace a sump pump for example, woo! And I pay all my own expenses, big expenses for both of us like car repairs, and for all the groceries (my single mom is not working right now so that she can take care of my grandparents so I've been helping with costs).

I am currently not working after having saved up a big chunk of dough because I wanted to take time off to go to therapy so that I can be more confident / would be a better romantic partner for my future man among other reasons, and am working towards more education to make a slight career change after having worked a few years in IT. After that, I am continuing to work towards saving up for my own home and was nearly there until I desired a career change (and the housing market went bonkers in price).

I am not waiting for marriage for sex, have a libido/know I would enjoy sex, etc though I'm not into casual dating and because of my inexperience I might not be quite as fast to get into bed as other ladies my age, but I have no set time limit - when it feels right. I don't have picky ass requirements (e.g I don't give a crap how tall a guy is or how much he makes because I've got my own money).

Met online. We talked for a month (very engaging conversations) until I finally agreed to go on a date with him cause I barely ever go on dates and he seemed super genuine and looking for something serious. First date went well. We grabbed sushi for dinner and he texted me after saying he had fun with some flirting going on during the date and after as well. After a few days he asked for a second date the next up coming week cus that week he was busy starting a new super demanding job. 

Long story short, the date kept getting pushed either on my end or his cause he had a trip out of the province for about a week. When he got back he tried to schedule it in but I was sick then he was busy with important meetings to get adjusted to his new job. Then he got sick for a few days. Over text everything was good. We kept talking like we did before and conversations were engaging with genuine interest being shown. It just kept taking a while to set up the date cause life kept getting in the way which is understandable and when he was available I wasn't and vice versa. Just September was a busy month.

Anyways, the weekend before the week of our potential second date he texted me saying he's going through some family problems and has been in a hard situation and won't be able to text me for a while. He also unfollowed me on Ig and got me to unfollow him which really threw me off. I told him I hope things were okay and just asked for some honesty rather than be in a ghosting type of situation. He replied by telling me his family found out he was on dating apps and was in a sticky situation and apologized again. I replied by saying that I was still confused cause it felt like a 180 and mentioned he could just say I'm a friend but if not I guess do what you gotta do and take care with everything. He didn't respond. 

Also it's important to mention that we both come from more religious households where we aren't supposed to date before marriage and all so that's why he got into trouble and maybe lost trust with his parents.

For the past 3 weeks, she has been initiating texting almost every day. She'd send everything from 'good morning' to 'good night' texts.

Then we went on a date and it was AMAZING. Best date I've ever had, amazing chemistry, ended up having sex at her place before I left to let her sleep. She told me before I left what a nice time she had.

Next morning I woke up to find no 'good morning' text from her. So I texted her something about an inside joke. She texted me that day most of the day, although seemed more 'cold'. Then that afternoon I suggested to hang out again and she didn't even address that request, just texted back about something else.

Haven't heard from her in the last 24hrs+.

Any ideas why this could be the case?

I don't want to look needy and start initiating texts all of a sudden, but I don't know whether she might be turned off because I seemed needy by requesting to hang again, or because she's playing it cool.

Something a small and shy girl like her would almost never do. Well all three of us went to the movies, she didn‚Äôt talk much or like the movie at all. She wanted another date and promised it would be different, but this time she wanted to have sex because she never had it before. It had been a minute and I let her know that I wasn‚Äôt in love with her and that it would be strictly for pleasure. She said that she just wanted someone to lose it to, but she wanted that person to be a good person and willing to treat her right. So I found it as a win-win but still wasn‚Äôt sure if I was just taking advantage of a young lady like that. Then she sent me some nudes and I was game. I picked her up a few days later and I asked if she wanted to get some food or watch a movie before heading to my place. She said no and we went to my spot. The problem is that she was nervous and as much as I tried to work with her, she didn‚Äôt let me. She kept saying that I was too big and that it hurt but I was barely rubbing against her slit, not even going in. My initial approach was to be romantic, then I tried to be kinky, then Netflix and cuddles, then just stimulating the usual things (since I couldn‚Äôt stimulate her mind). Nothing was working for her and I could tell it was that she was scared. I told her that it was ok if we didn‚Äôt do it and that we could just watch something together. She picked Hulu and the Simpsons. She didn‚Äôt laugh in funny scenes, she didn‚Äôt try cuddling or holding hands. Luckily work called and said they needed me so I took her home but she was disappointed we didn‚Äôt hang out more. She also asked me how I could have a Long Distance Relationship‚Ä¶ What a train wreck tbh‚Ä¶ After I told her I didn't want an LDR with someone I don't know yet she wanted to stay as pen pals until she gets back.

Sorry if i have any typos, since english is not my main language and im currently using a phone.

There are some girls i like that live near me, but i never have balls to just go and talk with them or ask her out or whatever. I have never been in a relationship.
I used to go out with my old classmates back then, but after injurying my leg and not going out with them for a month they kicked me from the groupchat we had (one of the boys kicked me).

Since then i have lack of confidence when talking with pretty much anyone, but especially girls, since i automatically think what if they dont like me?

You are probably going to say to go to the gym and get fit or go get some hobbies, but for personal reasons, i cannot lose weight until next year summer. And i honestly dont know any hobbies also that would interest me. Most of the time i play csgo or watch netflix, and thats pretty much it.

What do you suggest me to do? How can i get rid of my lack of confidence and how could i possibly meet new friends or maybe someone special? Im gonna say honestly, thinking about making a tinder account is a big no from me, because i keep thinking if some of my friends see me there and start making jokes or something

So I've been talking to a girl I work with for the past month or so and we've met up this week outside of work for a coffee, which went really well. So far so good. 

When I first got her number I asked to meet up and she said she was happy to do that, but only as friends as she is recently out of a long term relationship. I was totally fine with that, however as time has passed and I've gotten to know her better I think I'm starting to have feelings for her. During our coffee it was really good, just got to chat for ages (like 4 hours nonstop) about ourselves and really got to know each other, there was a little flirting too, at least I think there was. After our coffee she seemed really keen to meet up again but instead go for dinner and/or drinks next week. I feel like two single people going for dinner and drinks is a date? Maybe that's just me.

I'm anxious about the whole thing because I do really like her but I feel like I shouldn't tell her because she might say she still only wants to be friends and then it would probably ruin the connection we have as friends. I feel like I'm moving too fast, as we have only met up once outside of work, but I can't help the way I feel.

To summarise; I'm beginning to like a girl I work with, however she's recently single, so I don't want to tell her how I feel as it might put her under pressure.

Last weekend I was at a bar with a friend and I posted a story of it, and she replied that she was also there. I didn't catch the message on time but she invited me to another bar where she went to. We talked there for an hour alone and there was some nice vibes (at least that was what I thought), and at the end before she took a taxi we kissed (I was the one who made the move but she followed and it wasn't just a kiss on the lips, more like a passionate kiss that lasted for a while).

Right after she got home she texted me if I also was back and everything was alright. I answered that yeah, everything's fine etc and that it was a nice night. And I said goodnight. The following morning she just liked that message without answering. And we didn't talk for the entire week. Last night I also posted a story of a bar I was out (yes, I go to bars and post stories apparently, that's what I do!), she reacted to it, I texted her that she also seemed to have fun as she was in a live gig and she replied that ""it was a nice show"". Just that.

I'm pretty sure that she is not interested at all but there are some stuff that I can't understand. What do you think about that? Should I just leave it there?

So first, I live in a very car-centric city in the U.S., but I don‚Äôt drive (and I don‚Äôt ever really plan on doing so).

There‚Äôs also the fact that while I am in college, I‚Äôm not working currently. anddd I live at home with a parent. So basically I‚Äôm a high schooler!

I can‚Äôt reasonably ask someone, who conceivably has their sh*t together, to lower their dating standards like that just for me. The dilemma is that any of these (genuine) reasons are just going to be interpreted as me not liking them and trying to let them down easy, but that isn‚Äôt the case at all. While I definitely really like them, I think I‚Äôm just going to end up looking very juvenile without a car/job and living at home with parent.

I wasn‚Äôt really expecting to hit it off well with anyone (I haven‚Äôt ever really done dating at all), so I‚Äôm realizing I need to let them know these things now while it‚Äôs still new and we haven‚Äôt developed anything deep.

I would like to tell her but feel like the situation is already complicated enough and that I shouldn't impose on her like that. 

Some context: Both me and my friend (24M), let's call him D, recently went through breakups after relationships of \~5 years. My gf left me and that wasn't easy for me, but it was not an ugly breakup. D on the other hand had been cheating on his gf, let's call her A, throughout their relationship, and now he had found himself a new gf, so he finally broke up with A in what became a very ugly breakup. A was heartbroken.

Now me and A had always gotten along well and I had always really liked her as a person. I have always felt bad about the way that D had treated her, and that I never had told her about him cheating on her. I was also pissed at D for his behavior. A and I began hanging out more, talking about our respective breakups, comforting each other and bonding over it. Before, I had only really known her as my friend's girlfriend, but I quickly felt that we were developing a bond of our own. Soon after I began crushing on her and I felt like it might be mutual, but I didn't want to tell her right away for several reasons: First, we had only recently become close, and I didn't want to give her the impression that I had only been hanging out with to her in order to get with her. Second, I didn't want to come off as D's horny friend that has always had the hots for her and has only been waiting for D and A to break up (Which wasn't the case, like stated above, I was also in a long term relationship previously. But somehow I was still worried about appearing as such). And third, and most importantly, A had just gone through a pretty bad breakup which she was still dealing with emotionally, so it just didn't feel right to inject my feelings for her into that situation of vulnerability. I figured I'll just give her some time to process and then I can tell her, no big deal.

Turns out though, that not everyone is considering these things. Another guy, a former friend of D's, let's call him M (24M), sees his chance and tells her that he has always had feelings for her. A tells me she doesn't have feelings for him and that she is not ready for a new relationship but she welcomes his affection anyway. They develop a sort-of-relationship. She doesn't have feelings for him and talks about ""being single"" when her and I hang out, but they spend a lot of time together, even vacation together. A and I still hang out and talk. I still have a crush on her and I'm still convinced the feeling might be mutual, I just feel it when I am with her. I get the feeling that her fling with M is not serious for her and that she is just happy not to be alone at this time. She is still processing the breakup with A and emotionally vulnerable.

I still want to tell her about my feelings, but I'm still worried about all the same stuff, especially now that M had come in and complicated the picture. At this point I have to move to a different city for work. When I say goodbye to A we promise each other to stay in close contact and to continue our newly developed bond. It was a strange moment, it almost felt like we were telling each other about our feelings between the lines of what we were actually saying. I move away, and A is constantly on my mind. My feelings for her are getting more intense. We exchange messages, but much less than what I hoped for. She is a busy girl who is still struggling emotionally, so I try not to read anything into it. I would like to tell her so many things, but I'm afraid of pushing her too hard.

My new city is not that far away, so I go home to visit after a couple weeks and I am really looking forward to seeing A again. When I finally see her it is great and she is also really happy to see me. I cringe internally at my crush-induced behavior and figure I should finally tell her, because I can't take it anymore and just want to know. Then I find out that A is now living with M because she lost her apartment, and my resolve to tell her is fading. But A makes sure to stress that they have separate rooms and that it is a temporary solution. I go home just as conflicted about the situation as before. 

I want to tell her, but it doesn't feel right to impose myself on her already complicated situation. She's still dealing with her breakup, and she has that thing with M going on. On top of that, I live in a different city for at least the next six months. She is also the ex of my friend D, who also hasn't properly processed their breakup yet. It's kind of selfish of me to want to tell her, I feel like. My heart tells me to just go for it, but I am worried that that might be pushing her too hard right now and that I might destroy our friendship.

We‚Äôve been dating for about 3 years now, and for almost that entire time we‚Äôve been dating long distance. Right now we live a state away from each other, and I should be moving back next year, but since I‚Äôm going to grad school next year I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll make it back there. The distance has been nice because it makes us focus on ourselves and develop our careers, but it‚Äôs also widened a gap between us and made me look objectively at myself, her, and our relationship. 

While she has a ton of redeeming qualities, like being smart, beautiful, witty, explorative and great at golf,I can‚Äôt help but notice some other things as well. She doesn‚Äôt seem all that concerned with the future, economically or educationally, she just knows she wants to travel and have money. While I too want to travel and have money, I know that there are certain steps you have to take to get those things, like going to school and getting a job that doesn‚Äôt pay minimum wage, and starting a side hustle. She‚Äôs just started a community college last semester, and honestly I‚Äôm so proud about that, but I‚Äôm afraid she‚Äôs going to use it to have fun instead of doing what she needs to do. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I want to her to have friends and hang out with other people besides me, I‚Äôm fine with that, I just know she gets distracted so easily. I‚Äôve also noticed how she just spends money left and right, even though I‚Äôve tried to help her set up a basic financial portfolio, and told her about the importance of a Roth IRA. 

Overall, it just seems like she‚Äôs really not thinking about her future long term, and that‚Äôs only one of the things. We haven‚Äôt gone all the way before, we‚Äôve only tried before she says it‚Äôs too painful and stops. Whenever I see her in pain I feel bad and don‚Äôt push the subject, even though it leaves me extremely frustrated. Am I being a an ass for expecting sex from my girlfriend? I don‚Äôt think I am, but I always end up feeling like one when I ask if we can try. She has a hormonal disorder where she doesn‚Äôt get horny and doesn‚Äôt get her period as well as a few other things, so I try to be understanding. But honestly sometimes it feels like she just doesn‚Äôt even try to think about it from my side. My frustration with her is getting to the point where I don‚Äôt even want to have sex with her, and I‚Äôm constantly looking at other girls. It makes me feel like such an asshole, and my friends tell me it‚Äôs not my fault, but having been cheated on before I feel grossed out by myself when I do. 

The last thing is probably compromise. I just feel like it‚Äôs always gotta be her way.  Thing is that we both have strong personalities, so we fight a bit when we disagree, and things only start moving if I compromise, and sometimes she does. Thing is, I don‚Äôt know how much of this
Is just in my head, and how much of it is reality. I know I‚Äôm not texting her as much as I should and that im not as enthusiastic about our relationship as I used to be, but that‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm getting what I want from this relationship.

You either like or dislike someone and in the very moment they ask you if you like them back you already know it, so why would this simple matter require receiving so much counseling from friends? 

I confessed my feelings for her 1 week ago, however She was already seeing it coming, because I made it clear in other ways that I liked her. Her friends knew about all the signals and special attentions I was giving her, long before I confessed.
It makes me confused as we guys won't spend so much time talking about a lady who's into us if don't like her back. 
Was it a heart-wrenching decision to put me in the friendzone so that She has to ponder it with her trusted friends? I heard rumors She is in a difficult relationship with a dude but She has never told me about it and, also, her behavior has cruelly strung me along.

I met up with a guy M22 I matched on tinder around two months ago we only met up yesterday as our schedules never really aligned, we‚Äôve been talking everyday. All was going great we have the exact same humour so a lot of jokes it was fun. Side note I make jewelery and a few weeks prior to this meet-up he said if I make him a necklace he‚Äôd buy me food and asked for restaurant recommendations and I gave him one. So he asked if I wanted to eat there, we get there I order just a starter cause I wasn‚Äôt that hungry he orders a starter, main and water. Food comes he asks me if I want to try his I declined and he kept offering so I said sure just to be polite I just took a tiny bit. I offered him mine and he took a big portion. I didn‚Äôt finish it and he ended up eating all my food leftovers. When the bill comes he asks to split it, I was a bit confused as prior he agreed to buy me food  for the necklace I made him. The waiter asked us to split it among our selves and he also makes me pay for the water he ordered? I just did because I wasn‚Äôt about to argue over money. Idk if I‚Äôm overreacting but it‚Äôs just weird to me. Lowkey feel like he used me for free jewellery. And throughout the whole entire date we never even had any serious conversation like he‚Äôs funny but he kind of over did it with the jokes and he can never be serious so it got a bit annoying.

Her friend told me that she likes me soo much, but also told me to not tell the girl I like about her friend telling me how she's obsessed with me. But recently, I unadded her on accident and she got pretty mad/pissed off at me, but she apparently was asking all her friends what to do, and all her friends literally contacted me asking me why (this is when one of her friends said she liked me so much), when it was all accidental, and I obviously added her back. But, although her friend put proof ( a screenshot) that she still likes me after I accidentally unadded her, do I still tell her I like her or what?

And how should I say it if I do, Like do i first talk about how her friends kindaaaaa exposed her, but it was in a good way because I like her back too, or the other way around",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1091773,public,self,Does this girl like me?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qe6q5l/does_this_girl_like_me/,all_ads,6,,,,,

I got this puzzly situation, and I am not too sure how to make my move. Maybe I can get a few good suggestions. 

So I met this Girl on Tinder about a week ago we met on Tuesday and had an ''okay date'' (not great), I frequently go on Tinders dates and usually have a better time, but this girl got me really intrigued. Before our first date, we were on the phone for 2 hours, and ever since we would text a lot every evening. She would never, and I mean never initiate contact first (which in my opinion is a sign of a low interest), yet she would reply instantly every time. 

So last time we spoke was this Friday, and she mentioned she got some games at home. I asked if that's an invitation and she said that she doesn't know, so after a few texts we agreed on meeting at her place on Monday, she said she'll be free for sure (she was busy Sunday).

Now since she never initiates contact, I need to confirm time and address but I want to do this the right way.  Any advice would be appreciated! (we have a lockdown here, so there is no other way we can meet).
