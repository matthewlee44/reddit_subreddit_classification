She's been in this on again off again relationship with Greg. The thing is though they aren't in a relationship. They never have been but it's been on again and off again. They've been doing the tango then they stopped for a minute then again. She wants a relationship and he does but also doesn't. Meaning he wants to but doesn't think he's ready mentally. He had a rough past or something. I don't know the details of it except he had an abusive ex. He keeps pushing her away but then pulling her back then again. He'll tell her ""You can date other guys"" to which she doesn't want to. Now recently he told her that he just wants to be friend. So more physical stuff. No more kissing, no more tango etc. But will call her hun sweetie, etc. Her birthday is coming up on the 5th. So he bought her apparently $100 worth of presents. To which a ""friend"" doesn't do for another friend. That's something a boyfriend would do. I've asked her when is enough enough? How far will she go before she says no more of back and forth. She never gave me an answer by the way. She told me that when she talks to Greg that if they want to be friends and just be friends with no outcome of it being romantic then it's needs to be that. Though I suspect that Greg might be too much of pansy to actually tell her that he doesn't want to be her boyfriend ever. I mean considering for the last 3 months he's been saying he's going to quit his corporate warehouse job. Though he won't. Anyway my friend and I call her Bella are just over it at this point. Bella was over it around December and they started talking in November. Cassie told me that her and Greg have had a few bumps in the road. I told her they were pot holes and happened twice a month. She argued and said they were bumps and it wasn't twice a month. I told her didn't he just ignore you for a fking week just last week and we have another issue? You aren't in a relationship yet. You shouldn't be having this many issues to begin with. They basically aren't meant to be despite how in love she is but they are just too much. I'm 90% sure that all of Cassie's friends are done with her and Greg. I'm just the only sucker willing to listen but most of it is me going hmm yeah oh man. Uh huh. I also tested a theory if she would asked about me and this girl I've talking to. It's been almost 2 months and she has yet to ask. Love her but god woman...

Any advice to get her away from this guy? Things to say to her without losing her as a friend or seeming mean. Question to ask that make her really think about her relationship and maybe really break it off with Greg. Or should I just keep going yeah uh huh. Ok darn. Yep until she just crashes from this stupid drama. I'm at loss at this point and just want it to be over but it's like talking to a brick wall.

I started dating this guy and we agreed he wouldn't add anymore provocative women. I got pissed when I saw he added a provocative co worker that ended up being a lot of drama. He told me he just considered her a friend and we fought about it for awhile cause he didn't think she was a problem (let's call her Margot) I ended up breaking up with him. He told her about our problems after we broke up and she used that info against him (he told her not to reach out to me) she ended up reaching out to me and telling me I'm fucked up and doesn't know how he could be into me.  He ended up deleting her after seeing she was a problem.

Fast forwarding about 3 months. He thought I should know about the recent drama at work. He told me Margot is now involved with some other male co worker, and he's married. Somehow his wife heard about what happened between my bf and Margot. She said she doesn't like my bf cause he cheated on me (he claims he never cheated) (shes never met my bf and he's never met this guy's wife) Idk why my bf is being involved in this when it's not his problem. It's his male co workers issue. And told me he doesn't like how there's gossip going around at work being called a cheater and is scared of losing me and thinks one of those people will reach out to me and tell me more of the gossip. 

But I'm confused and concerned why he's even involved in this gossip. I asked him if he's been talking to her again, he told me he's not and doesn't like Margot. And doesn't like the married male co worker. But he has him on his social media. Idk I'm confused about all this. Maybe it's all gossip. I kinda worry he was involved with her recently.

1. Focused on my studies more. Now I am doing a PhD, followed by medical school.
2. Volunteered more, especially in areas I have very little knowledge in so I can meet more people AND become more well rounded. 
3. Dress nicely. I spent quite a bit on revamping my wardrobe, especially for clothes that fit well and look great on my body type/skin tone.
4. Work out. I'm pretty luck as a dude to be 6 foot. However, I have transitioned from chubby to fit. Pretty proud of myself on that!
5. I took on lots of household responsibilities, such as owning a dog, having complex plants, and keeping a clean environment. Kinda shows that I am a responsible human being that can keep things alive. 
6. I've been joining more events on Zoom so I can start talking more smoothly and confidently.
7. IVE READ A LOT ON DIFFERENT TOPICS. so I guess, I'm trying to be well read. 
8. I think a lot of dudes miss this, but I'm more interested in getting to know someone rather than just a fling. 
9. Not the greatest looking dude, but I mean I'd say my personality is great though. 

I'm honestly just puzzled at how I can't rarely secure dates or just attract women in general. Honestly, I just feel so defeated as a 23 year old whose put so much effort to improve themselves. I'm not saying I am dependent on a partner to be happy, but it'd be nice addition to my life where I can enjoy hobbies and interests with someone I deeply care about. Also, it'd be nice for someone to be me support, and vice versa. After a terrible day, I can come home to an environment that'd instantly make me forget why I'm  down, and vice versa.

I asked her for her number and we went on our first date that week. Since then things have been going really well. We’ve now been on 6 dates, each of which have been fun and easy.  The only issue I could possibly have is that she, and me to a lesser extent, aren’t big texters and only text to set up our next date. While normally this wouldnt be an issue, at the beginning of dating texting is nice way to keep the momentum of the previous date going, even if its through a couple texts a day. 

However, by all accounts, things are progressing nicely. We continue to open up to each other, we make time to see each other and our dates all last 4+ hours because they’re that easy and fun.  We have also hooked up after/during our last three dates, and while she’s definitely taken things slow in the bedroom, I’ve got no complaints. I’m not a huge “dater” and have some insecurities that make it hard for me to find someone to commit to. For that reason, I have always kept things casual with ex flings and tend run away or get bored once things begin to get serious. For the first time in years though, this isn’t the case.  

I haven’t felt this way in years and finally have found myself in a position where I am ready to progress to more. For me this means a couple things. First, I would like to talk more for no other reason than I want to hear about her day and be in her life. Even if its just a text or two a day, I would like to talk more than once a week to set up her date. Next, I think hanging out once a week is good while getting to know someone, but after a month and 6 dates, I want to see her more. I know I want something more with her, maybe not at this second, and call me crazy but I want to spend more time with the person I like and love being with. That doesn’t mean everyday, but 2 - 3 days a week would be nice. Lastly, and this is big for me, I want our lives outside of each other to start to cross. I want to meet her friends and want her to meet mine. I want to go out with her and have fun on weekends rather than just seeing her one on one once during the week at dinner or whatever we’re doing. She has definitely shown some shy tendencies and has mentioned she wants to take things slow. The only tine we’ve discussed us was on our third date where we told each other how we feel about one another and talked about how we both are open to a relationship.  Since it’s been weeks since we had a relationship talk, I would like to open up with her more on our next date and see where we’re both at. 

Now for my questions:

She has communicated that she wants to take things slow and based on her actions and words, she seems happy with the minimal texting, hanging out every 5 -7 and keeping our lives separate. I’m ready for more and to start picking up the pace.  I dont want to keep going like this and waste my time. *Are these appropriate things to communicate at this point? If so, how? Do I just directly say everything I mentioned above? Do I tell her where I’m at and ask what she wants?* I don’t want to overwhelm her or scare her away, but after a month and 6 dates I feel like its a fair time to ask if she’s happy with where we’re at and where we’re going?

Secondary question:

Is it adnormal to want to see her more than once a week at this point? We live 5 minutes from each other and have super flexible schedules so its not a timing issue, it’s a willingness thing. In addition, is texting as little how we do as abnormal as I think it is? Are there any better alternatives or work arounds?

&amp;#x200B;

I can go on a date and have a really good time, but then I ghost the person regardless of how nice they may have been. I can look at people and say who I’m attracted to, but it’s very matter-of-factly and I don’t really feel an urge to go talk to them or do anything about it. Pretty much no one seems impressive or interesting enough to keep my attention. People have to be very persistent to get through my walls, and no one has that kind of patience. They just interpret my silence and passiveness as lack of interest.

Long time fwb (25m) and I (25f) had been wanting a threesome for a minute now but things took a wrong turn.

Backstory: He’s def more like a situationship bc I have feelings for him. We met about three years ago, while still in college. Didn’t attend same college but nearby so convenient. We have been semi long distance (opposite sides of LA) for about a year and half now since we each moved back home. See each other about every other week. Super close, tell each other EVERYTHING, not even exaggerating it’s true. 

Anyway, we had been wanting a threesome for a minute. I wanted a stranger bc I felt more comfortable kinda like a one time thing with that person. But last weekend I wanted to go out and get drinks with him and friends nothing sexy. He asked I he could bring over another one of his “friends” which was the girl he sees much more often bc she lives down the street for him. Lucky girl. However, she also has feelings for him and I know that bc he told me. He also told me that he doesn’t reciprocate those feelings. I felt bad for her bc I know how she feels. However my fwb doenst know I still harbor feelings for him (I lie and say I got over him) which is why he tells me everything. Anyway, he had to lie to this girl that we hadn’t seen each other in a long time (even tho we got a hotel room the weekend before) in order for her to feel comfortable. Even tho he’s been honest about him seeing other girls, she’s more sensitive so he twists some truths (which I see wrong and have pointed it out to him.)

Fast forward to last weekend. The three of us end up going out, drinking, laughing. Tbh I really liked her and thought we can make good friends. We got a room, more liquor, and started to fool around once we broke the ice between us. My fwb due to a mixture of liquor and insecurity, could t get it up. We just laid there, consoling him and making sure he didn’t feel emasculated. The girl heads to the bathroom, and I told my fwb to place his phone down bc I had seen him grab it multiple times due to work. I had been a bit bothered bc we had waited so long to have this moment at last (the threesome) and here he was working. Well he snapped and raised his voice at me.

Never in the years I met him did he do such a thing. With alcohol in my system I got emotional and started crying. The girl came out and tried to calm him down but he was still not having it. Then I decided to leave and he grabbed me and started hugging me, while apologizing. I told him we never ever fight like that and how could he do that to me. Next day, he texts me to say sorry, I forgive him, but he’s the one that says he needs distance to clear his head and he told both the girl and I that. 

My dilemma is:

1) should I really forgive him and/or keep seeing him? (I’d be fine to be strictly platonic friends in The future)
2) should I befriend the girl? (I really liked her but I know she will still see him)",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,691447,public,self,Situationship gone sour,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mhpb6b/situationship_gone_sour/,all_ads,6,,,,

In the beginning, I confess I started seeing him try to get over another guy that played me hard, the kinda guy that sends super expensive flowers to your house, takes you on trips, and great dinner finally gets sex, and then ignore you for a month, he uses the excuse he is always traveling for work and blah blah and sends more flowers to be forgiven, and 2 weeks later disappears again. I really reeeeeaaly liked the flowers guys and I wanted to make it work with him. I felt rejected and terrible when he disappeared so I blocked him in every form possible and decided I needed a distraction. I felt skeptical of putting my heart in the line so I decided I was only gonna date for fun, and I would do everything the opposite that I did with the flowers guy: not making myself too available, waiting to have sex, not hyper-focusing on him and let him take initiative.

I met this really cute guy on hinge we went on dates basically every week and we waited to have sex until a month and a half in, and even now we don't do it every time we see each other.  He asks me out for dinner, we have great conversations every time. We went ice skating and on walks and all that stuff. He messages me every day in my native language. I was really dating to pass the time but I ended up really liking this guy. He is a sweet and real gentleman when we hangout. He has that traditional charm to him you would expect an actor on an old movie to have. He has a great job, is finishing up college, and owns a property already at a very young age. He loves kids and plays the guitar, and has great smile. He is very supportive when I talk about projects and he is overall a great listener. He likes to go out with his friends and drink a little and I kinda like to do the same with my friends and none of us see it as a problem.  I really do think though that he gets confused with my actions sometimes because I try to be very diplomatic and I don't say what I feel/think, and I'm never the one setting up our dates or messaging first. Pure PTSD if you wanna know. Of course I show a lot of interest and make sure he knows i love spending time with him. 

I like him and I think that's the moment where I have to decide if I want to risk it (again) and let myself feel more. I really feel like I start falling for a guy once I start letting myself express more of what I feel for him. And I really don't want to get hurt again. I also don't want to directly ask him if he is looking for something serious or not because I feel like that puts pressure and I don't want to pressure anything. I just want to at least have an idea of his intentions and let it roll. 

Those are some indicators I got from him:

\*Our 2nd date was actually on valentine's day. He specifically invited me that day.

\*He introduced me to two of his friends.

\*He makes plans with me for the summer.

\*He takes me to his house and he told me last week I could come over whenever I wanted.

\*He invited me over to hang out with him on his birthday.

I know it seems pretty obvious, but my question really is: would any guys here say and do all of this to a girl they didn't themselves long term with?

so yesterday i told my bf that im supposed to get my period today (which i did) and were supposed to spend the whole weekend together (our first weekend together like this) - so id love to have sex with him all the time this weekend. so i told him about my period and asked him if hed care having sex on it (as i wouldnt) and he seemed a bit hesitant, so i felt hed rather not.

and now im having an inner dilemma - one part of me thinks that period should be really normalized and having sex on it should be ok, wed just extra clear ourselves before and after. so that part of me is a bit sad/annoyed that hes making a deal out of it. but the other part of me is really understanding, its just something hes obviously not comfortable with, so no prob, ill obviously not push him into anything and well just wait for a few days and enjoy the weekend doing something else than sex haha.

1) Match with a girl, we get chatting. 

2) Chat goes well! We arrange a date, we exchange numbers, move things onto whatsapp.

3) Keep the chat chill but engaging leading up to the date, ask them the day before if they're still up for it, always a yes.

4) Day of the date, no word, then when I message ""on my way see you soon"" I get a flaked on with ""ah sorry I can't make today, completely forgot I had plans, I'll let you know when I'm next free"" 

5) I begrudgingly respond with a ""no worries!"" and then move the chat to archive and just don't bother to chase them, because hey, someone who flakes at that short notice just isn't worth it.

6) Weeks, sometimes months later, I get an add from them on instagram, snapchat or whatever being like ""hey hows it going? remember me?"" Snapchat is the worst one because then they just plague me with selfie after selfie after selfie which you know is being sent to a mass of people, then I get accused of being ""quiet"" because I don't respond to them.

I understand that putting yourself out there is the only way to find a partner and rarely does it just fall in your lap, however I feel like we can all agree that it’s exhausting at times. 

I’m a 26F and have only experienced short term relationships. I’ve earned a masters degree, am very independent, love my friends and family, and have my own interests and hobbies. I only started dating in my early 20s and will admit that my own insecurities, unrealistic expectations, and avoidant tendencies make it even more difficult to date. However, I’m actively working on these things to ready myself for a healthy relationship.

Recently I’ve had an epiphany that really shifted my perspective and I’m hoping it may help some people. 

Since I’ve started dating I’ve approached it rather apathetically and carelessly even though I desire a long term partnership. I’ve always compared myself to others and equated my lack of a relationship to my worth. We all can agree that our worth is not determined by our relationship status and that everyone’s life path looks extremely different, even though many of the people around us are coupled up and in love. I’ve also witnessed a fair number of relationships that start out of desperation, which is something I don’t desire and would rather be single than with someone I feel lukewarm about but am with them for attention, comfort, etc. Always being the third wheel and experiencing everyone else entering into relationships stirred up quite a bit of bitterness in my own conscience. I always thought to myself “why them and not me? I’m dating and have been patient and have been single for a long time so why do they find what they’re looking for but I can’t?”

What I failed to realize was that I was so focused on idealizing the perfect partner/ relationship without taking into consideration the facets of a healthy relationship or looking for a potentially healthy partner. I would completely ignore red flags because he was “my type” or because I liked the way he made me feel (ego boosts suck). I’ve rejected guys that probably would have been ideal partners, but since they didn’t meet my “expectations” or make me feel a certain way, I didn’t want it. Another universal truth I’ve had a hard time accepting is that no one can make us happy - healthy relationships consist of two content people. The happier and more confident we are with ourselves will show when we’re dating. 

I’m committed to taking time away from dating and distractions to focus on a few things: 1. Who am I, really? I think I have an idea, but we evolve. 2. What/ who do I even want? 3. Realizing relationships don’t define our worth, who we are, and what we’ve accomplished so far. 4. Being at peace with my situation at all times, no matter what. 

I feel content and I’m peaceful since redirecting my train of thought in regards to dating and relationships. I no longer feel anxious about dating (or lack thereof) and have been focusing on how I can better myself and work on myself so that when the time does come, I can date with purpose. That doesn’t mean dating will get any easier, but shifting my perspective and remaining mindful of the process may allow me to eventually navigate the dating pool slightly more successfully.

Especially with the men in my university. I see a lot of them who are perceived as likeable and really cool amongst peers. Some of them are really popular and liked by everyone. The thing is, they're assholes. Or at least from what I can tell. They disregard other peoples feelings, and dont really give a shit about anything except what they want, and dont care who they hurt. It usually reels good results for them, i.e more friends, more of what they want, more hookups. They're more confrontational, mean and often sarcastic when it comes to picking on others. 

&amp;#x200B;

I dont really like the idea of hurting others just to get what I want, but it seems to workout for them, plus they get more rewards for it for some reason. Girls seem to just gravitate towards them and somehow they get more girls every week. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some are loud while others are just quiet and speak when they have something to say, the quiet types tend to get more girls than the loud ones for some reason but they still have that mean behavior. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me on the other hand, I'm more mild mannered. Im not really confrontational, when someone says something thats meant to insult me, It just...doesnt, I usually ignore it, I dont really know how to respond in a witty or sarcastic ways that the ""assholes"" at my university do so I just tend to ignore it, some of my friends think that I ignore it because im offended, but I just really dont have a way of responding thats funny or witty, and I cant really bother to spend energy to do that. If I do end up responding to something insulting i just say, ""Thank you' with a smile and thats about it. I have a small group of friends that I'm usually ok with being talkative, but I guess for some reason, girls from an outside perspective dont like guys who are too talkative. Like I'm a good listener, from what others tell me, but I guess me talking to much isnt masculine, or ""alpha"" idk. I guess I have a wierd hobby, I like spray painting in my free time, and I think Im really good at it, but girls at my university dont think too much of it, they tend to gravitate towards guys with musical talent like guitar or piano, which I wish but I really have no interest in  creating music. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really looking for a girlfriend, but Im open to one. But I just like hooking up, which I cant say ive done much of since it was only twice, and they only hooked up with me because the guys they wanted werent interested in them so they settled for me.

Well, I'm 29F and I had ""serious"" relationship 3 times. 6, 2 and 2 years. I received proposal 3 times. Said yes 3 times. And all 3 of them cheated. One of them used to cheat on me every single time he didn't like what and how I'm speaking or the tone of my voice.

I matched with him and he seemed very keen and talkative and we started messaging. He was messaging every day and this is boy something I’m used to but as we got on I soon started getting used to hearing from him every day. Also did a few calls and he would call me on the way home from work. 
I’m a take it slow type of gal as I’m looking for a genuine connection and try to take testing frequency as a pinch of salt. 
I met him twice and we had great dates where he seemed really interested in me. He was also suggesting road trips and possible things we can do in the future together. 
I had to go out of town recently for 2 weeks abs I explained this and said “it’s great getting to know you but as I’m out of town the next few weeks, if you are keen to get to know each other better when I’m back - I’ll let you know when I’m back but in the meantime we can do FaceTime. 
He seemed keen on this but as I’ve tried to keep in touch when I’m away I can feel the change and shift in how behaviour. I tried to suggest a FaceTime but he said it was late and messaging was dry so I stopped messaging but leaving it with a speak soon. 
I haven’t heard anything in almost a week and would now feel a bit silly messaging when I’m back considering his lack of interest now. 
Was he every genuine in the first place? I’ve also had a dating experience where the guy messaged every day and was overly keen and as soon as I slowed it down he admitted it was just for a hookup.

I recently met a girl through a dating app. We had a few video calls and one in-person date, and things were looking really great. However, the day after our in-person date she told me that she had thought she was a in a place to date someone, but didn't think she was ready for that (she's in a phase of big transition right now). She told me that made her sad because I had a lot of what she was looking for. I asked if she was open to discussing it and she said she just didn't think dating was wise for her right now. Everything ended amicably. This was a little less than 3 weeks ago.

The last thing I told her (via text) was that I promised she wouldn't hear from me again, I wished her the best, etc., including that I would delete her number so I couldn't contact her again. I also told her that if in the future she contacts me, I might be open to rekindling our relationship.

On one hand, I told her I wouldn't contact her again, and I take promises seriously. However, I think I've also done myself a disservice in saying I might be open to trying again and leaving that open-ended, as now I'm just hoping that in the future she contacts me (which could very well be never). Would it be okay to contact her explaining this and ask 1) is there a possibility of us dating again in the future? and 2) if so, can we set a timeline, for example, ""lets talk around the beginning of June"" or something?

TL;DR - Met a girl. Things were going well, but she decided she wasn't ready to date yet. Last text I sent her was saying I wouldn't contact her again, but if she contacted me I might be open to trying again. Would it be okay to contact her asking if that's even a possibility, and if so, if we could set a concrete time for us to talk about the possibility?

**Light, camera, queue juicy drama.**

Among our many conversations then, she said she's going to take at least a year until she starts dating again. The other day I found out via mutual friend that she already started though, doing every wrong thing. The classic why don't they call me back in the AM phase.

I didn't and don't want anything romantic with her, but the news stuck in my head. For most of the day it kept bothering me in some way I don't understand. Friend told me that's normal and I shouldn't worry about it. Eventually the thoughts morphed into a ""noooo person I know super well don't do that to yourself!"" This made sense, at least.

Being the dummy I am, at this point I decide to call her. Move our interactions to being friends instead of brief texts once in a blue moon. Encourage her to date smart, wish her the best, pure intentions only. Figured many years together and her saying before that she cares about me platonically would make this fine.

_Boy was I wrong_

In like my fifth sentence or something I got a smidge sarcastic with ""not going to date for a year? my ass!"", **in context of saying** she _can_ do whatever she wants, it's none of my business, but I just wanted to make sure she's ok and doing the right thing for herself. Saying that hit a nerve for her is an understatement. Latched onto my brief sarcasm, and I got yelled at for it indeed being none of my business and interrogated about who sold her out by telling me. Mmmmk.

That made me mad. I was trying to do something nice, but instead got yelled at for very briefly and in passing calling her out on being dishonest. Five minute call later, I said not so nicely that I don't need this and hung up. Sent an angry scoldy text asking for an apology afterwards, backhandedly wishing her the best otherwise.

Not a proud moment, pretty much the reverse of clear empathetic communication between human beings. But catharsis in its own right. Don't think we'll talk again, noticed she even took me off her social media as a result 🤷‍♂️

Now to the real issue.

The whole thing stirred some stuff up in me. Reminded me of that feeling of a friend turning away from me, kind of like what I felt in the few conversations we still had toward the end of dating. This was the closest person I had for years, now right off the cuff rejecting an attempt at basic friendship and in a not so hot way either.

Guess it's fine, I don't need those kinds of issues in my life. But still, seven years into nothing.. Didn't sleep much tonight. Brain keeps cycling on this, like it hasn't done for a month and a half now.

Idk if this is the really bad kind of baggage and means I should back off on myself starting to date yet. On the daily, I'm excited for trying something new with someone else and am clear of my past. But my strong emotional response tonight, even if not romantically oriented, makes me wonder if I'm really ready.

Your any and all thoughts?

So I had been going on dates with this person for a few weeks. Things had been going slowly but well, and we had planned on going a date this past Monday. I texted her on Friday trying to throw out some date ideas, and all of a sudden she stopped responding. She doesn't text all weekend, either.

Now I'd gotten the sense that her interest was waning so I thought that if her not texting back means she really isn't that interested she should tell me. So when Monday came along and she doesn't say anything, I'm thinking ""what the fuck"". It wasn't until I texted her two hours before we were supposed to meet that she calls me ""to be honest"" and say she ""wasn't feeling it.""

I'm not mad about the fact that things ended. What I am mad at was how it ended. I didn't get the sense that she was going to text me had I not said anything; maybe it's the cynic in me, but I feel she would have been more than fine ghosting if she could get away with it. Good riddance.

This one really hurts though because we had a lot in common and she seemed genuinely into me, but after that first night she flaked on me for a wine and cuddles night (only thing we could do because of lockdowns) and started being cold when I was talking about doing more things than just sex. I feel like i wasn't intimate withh her enough before having sex and was coming off as a person who just wants sex. I deleted her because it really hurt that she just completely lost interest in me and would barely text me back anymore or respond to stories and i couldnt handle seeing her stories at the time or her private stories. Flash forward 3 months to today, and i feel like ive gotten stronger about my emotions and been taking care of myself and my focus isnt on women. But now I really miss her aura/vibe and wanted to see how she was doing and made a new snapchat to text her which is bad enough i assume. She added me last night and i texted her this morning a couple jokey texts about how the $1400 stimulus check reminded me of 1400 lies i told her and how i wish i was the irs so i could tax them back. She was responding well and asked who it is, and i sent her pictures and told her she didnt have to respond.. and that i hope all is well with this little emoji❄️
She then said Lmaooo😂 You're too much
I didnt expect it to be you
Im good lol
That hit me hard asf and i assumed she meant shes good on talking to me again, but looking at our convo I think she migjt have meant she's doing good but i guess ill never know because I left her on read so as not to be even more annoying and viewed her most recent stories, and about an hour later I was deleted. Atleast not blocked this time, but it seems as though she never wants me to contact her again. Should I have given her more time or just moved on when i had the chance.. It's been 3 months and i still think about her atleast once a day even when I try my hardest not to, it just seems like I'll never be able to get over her and even if i did find a new girl it just seems like it'll be to fill the void she left. I wasn't looking for anything at all before she added me on snapchat back in september of 2020, was completely happy by myself, and now my chest hurts and it feels like im just going to guard myself from ever loving someone after going through this talking stage and fucking up by having a sort of soul bond with someone who considered me a quick fling.

She told me she is changing her mind every 5 seconds between staying with me or leaving me. We were madly in love and i havent felt these feelings for someone ever.

Now ive told her sorry multiple times and ive taken action to proof her i can change. I deleted all other girls on social media, broke all contact with the fwb girl and shared my fb and instagram pw. Im doing all these things but not getting anyfeedback wether we are still going for this or if she is going to leave me. Her explenation is , we are in a grey zone. 

Last night she told me we just had to talk face to face because it is way better than on social media. Which is true because we had some calls and during those calls we can laugh and she tells me she still loves me and we both cry etc.. when on social media she is just acting really mad.

I don't know how to put this, but at first i didn't see any appeal to her but as time went on, her personality, attitude, hardworking nature and positivity drew me closer and closer to her. 
She is 5 years younger than me and we text almost daily.

 Although she doesn't reply to some texts and just abruptly end conversations out of the blue, I believe we have meaningful conversations. I am pretty sure that she might not see me the same way I see her, my assumption is that she thinks of me as a friend almost like a brother. I really don't want to mess the friendship I have with her up so I won't be confessing anything atleast for the time being.

 Is it okay for me to go forward this relationship romantically??  Should I??  
Is the lack of replies a sign of ""she's not that into you?""
Am I overthinking things? 
The language classes ends in 6 months so I am waiting to see how things turn out from here.
