1. He just went on vacation with a few friends…including his ex who he is very good friends with. The ex is married. I’m mostly indifferent to this but she is in every photo/video …around him.

2. He is very eager to be in a relationship with me. I had a habit of rushing into things but I’m trying to take it slow and not jump into being exclusive without assessing the person properly. But he tries to woo me with attention/calls/messages and has made it clear that he would like to be exclusive.

His brother is regularly a dick, but today he was trying to take him outside to physically fight, and even said something to me.

After describing a fever he said he stood up and felt dizzy, keeps saying he doesn't feel well, and suggested I shouldn't go to my grandparents in case he has covid or something. 

So I said I'd give it a few hours to see whether he got worse, and told my grandparents, and now we're waiting when he says he needs to use the restroom.

He's in the restroom for a long while, so I'm not sure if he's having tummy issues or not, but he usually sits on his phone for a long while. Comes back and he's acting more sick, says he's very cold, and is now shivering? But they very honestly seem fake, and I only say that because I have had a lot of people just fake random sickness to me for various reasons.

She did end up having internet and she started messaging me and sending me photos of her trip each day. She even video called me one night. All of our exchanges felt a little awkward though - she very clearly wanted to talk but was very busy with the trip. I struggled this past week with how much to engage.

The frequency of messages aside, we also usually have very deep conversations and this all felt very surface level as we rushed to squeeze conversations in.

We got coffee. I came in with no expectations with how it would go because a) I did not want to disappoint myself and b) I act differently from my normal self if I have an idea of how things ""should"" go (which just comes off as really forced and not fun). So we're chatting over our coffee. Our little get together started at 2. Well..... after chatting for what seemed like not very long it was already 6p.m and the coffee shop was closing. He and I continued talking outside for a little bit. His body language was relaxed which was nice. Me being me, I like to ask the ""invasive"" question to EVERYONE, nobody is sacred or left out with ""What are you thinking?"" Not because I am an invasive person (I don't think I am) but he seemed like he wanted to ask me something, which as a fellow introvert, for me it's easier if someone catches my body language and gives me a way to tell what is on my mind without being super forced and crammed into the conversation. 
So I asked him what he was thinking. He told me he was surprised with how much we had in common, how it didn't seem like 4 hours we were talking, and he was wondering if it would be alright if he hugged me. I could tell just how hesitant he seemed to ask that if it was alright, just how nervous he was. Which I sorta understand the nervousness of that, I mean asking the opposite sex a question can be pretty scary. I did accept, I do like him. We did hug, it wasn't awkward (surprisingly) but the kind of hug you could just melt into the other person with. We did end up kissing and talking for an additional two hours, we both vocalized how much of a nice time we had (he said it first) and gave a kiss goodnight. When I got home, I had a message from him of how much of a nice time he had. 
My question is now what? I was the one who asked if he wanted to get coffee. Personally yes, I would like there to be a second date, but I don't know if I should ask him or wait to see if he asks.

She doesn't just think I keep stuff from her and don't communicate. She calls me a full blown liar about different issues. There are things I have a hard time talking about, things that have nothing to do with her. I'm just not an open person.

I’m (f26) am dating a guy (m30) and we have been dating for almost a month. And the connection is really there and has been since the first date. There is a lot of communication and everything feels very ”open”. It almost feels like we have known each other a very long time. And when we spend time together I feel very comfortable, which feels a bit strange since it’s so new. 

So to my concern. We have lived very different lives up til now. Today we both have fulltime jobs and I have my own apartment but he currently lives with his mom because he’s been living back and forth between Sweden and the US. He is now in Sweden, as am I. However he has been quite open about his life he had before in the US, which has been a bit gang related and violent. He’s been in jail a few times for having guns on him and getting dui’s. He also has a 10 year old son that lives in the US.

So I’m okay with everyone having a different past and that people can change. But he occasionally still uses drugs (weed, sometimes cocaine). But since we are very communicative I’ve said that I dont feel super comfortable with that. And he is open that he is in a process of letting that old stuff go and that he is working on himself. 

I just cant get my head around if I’m taking a huge risk by proceeding dating this guy because of all his past and that he is still working on not dealing with that type of life anymore.

This is more than the 10th time I’m sure, I have expressed my boundaries and reinforced rules, and even told him how horrible it makes me (F19) feel. He says it’s not me, but I can’t get over the fact that it must be me. Like I’m not enough, I know we are still teens..but let me continue 

He thinks I’m so damn naive and says he’s “protecting my feelings” and it’s normal and if we went to counseling they would tell us to watch porn and it’s normal. Okay, it’s normal. But it’s not normal to be happening frequently (1-3 a week) in a 8 year relationship. Not to mention the females he’s spoke to and gotten pictures from. Lord knows what else he’s hiding.

Our relationship is definitely built off trauma bond, as I was left alone as a child and he was my parental guidance, my best friend, and then my boyfriend, everything. I feel like nobody would understanding basically looking my entire family when I’m without him, yes he cheated but because I see him as a parental guidance I’ll never see the true problems behind what he’s doing to me and has done in the past. Last night I explained to him our trauma bond, because he never understood why I am the way I am.

I broke up with him but still enjoy his every being but it hurts knowing hers looking and talking and seeking others. I want him to take care of me as he promised as kids. Lots of trauma behind my own self, and he knows that so I didn’t dump this on him at all, he knows what he’s with !! (8 year relationship!) do I continue to be with him...or what?

&amp;#x200B;

I reach out to ask for your advice and/or your opinion regarding what would be the best approach to keep in touch with someone that I have started to go out it.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, a bit of background. The other person, let's use the fake name Yamile, is a colleague that works in a distant department than mine. We, normally, don't see nor interact with each other during office hours. However, we have started to chat on a daily basis for topics that are beyond our roles and responsibilities (aka chit-chat) and our average conversations have escalated into (hints to) tasting the waters and borderline coquetry in a smooth way.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, we met this week for the first time outside work. We were, initially, going to have a meal. However, due to the covid-19 situation, she kindly asked me to avoid a restaurant. The good thing is that instead of canceling met, she insisted to replace it with a walk around a mall. Which ended up lasting 2 hours of perambulating and visiting the average groceries store of the mall (she was looking for 1 or 2 things in each place) and getting to know each other a bit deeper on the go. So far, the overall experience was ok. The only downside is that she came 30 minutes late, due to a justifiable personal issue. And we left taking the same public transport.

&amp;#x200B;

Third of all: Gifts. One of the excuses of our gathering was that I had to gave her (let's call it) a peculiar mug that I managed to obtain for her overseas while I was on vacation. Truth is that, she could've got it anywhere else, but she asked me to bought one for her (volunteering to pay for it, but ended up not doing). And this is one of my arguments about why I think is getting more intimate.

&amp;#x200B;

The other excuse of this pseudo-first-date was that I've asked her to keep a box for me as ,arguing that (the Plushie that is inside a discrete box with a note ""For Yamile"") is a environmental initiative that needs to be done in the city that this story is taking place, and I need her to kept for me given that I might be travelling/moving. And also, it was hinted as a favor to pay back due to getting her the peculiar mug.

&amp;#x200B;

So far, I will acknowledge that, from my point of view, both the peculiar mug and the Plushie inside the average box were supposed to be gifts. And I will also say that two gifts on the first ""date"" might be an overkill for a ""first date"". I will also say that, the initial plan, was to ask her to open the discrete box soon, just to make her realize that the box contains a gif for her. However, at the moment, I am not entirely sure when should I ask her to open the box/plushie gif. She already has a hint that It might be something like what I have described inside. I think that she might like it, because she already has lots of stuff from the same brand. Hence I would like to know your opinion about it. What would be the best next move?

&amp;#x200B;

We are expected to met again this weekend to have our postponed meal. Also, as a excuse to use the peculiar mug, we might also have a coffee.

Pretty often I, M24 nerdy &amp; geeky guy, start to think I’m not worth dating &amp; I wouldn’t find a cute girl which will like me.

I don’t feel «cool» enough. I don’t feel self-worth and confidence.

I had two girlfriends in the past, but that was mostly like some coincidence.

By my head, I understand that my achievements are great. 

I speak 2 foreign languages.

I work in IT and get salary a few times bigger most people get in my country and I can save money.

I got master’s degree (pretty common in my country) and started to study on PhD. 

I traveled a lot before pandemic and visited more than 10 countries. My look is ok, maybe an average.

I’m determined, silent and calm person, which can mark &amp; achieve my goals.

But there are a few things which make all these not worth in my eyes.

I’m M24 and still living with my mother. Also, she has anxiety, maybe a little controlling &amp; not confident in herself too. 

And that frustrates me very much.

When I see pretty girl, I start to think she’ll view me as broken because I live with mother &amp; got in contact with her every few hours. And as a result I don’t have self-worth &amp; confidence.

And even if girl is ok with that, I just don’t have a place to have sex with her during 1-3 months of dating. And I think most of girls won’t wait for this for so long and just will continue to scroll Tinder or something.

I don’t want to rent a flat now, I feel bad in foreign apartments &amp; pay big money every month for it, I feel ok at home now . 

I want to buy apartments in the future, I have this goal &amp; making it step by step. But it can take a few years.

But years are passing by, and it looks like I’m just wasting my best years.   
Meanwhile other people are dating, or at least gaining experience in it.

What can I do?

Sarah goes on Vacation and magically meets drake in the Club, Drake is pursuing her and he wants to date her. 

In my opinion, Sarah nearly always will dump brad for Drake. Why? 

Drake has more status, looks better, Money etc. Drake just has more VALUE then Brad.

Because many of you think i am talking absolute bullshit, i am even giving you a living proof.

Austin dunham is a Fitness youtuber with 100k on instagram, he looks very good, has social status, and is rich. 

He made a test video where followers can send him the instagram of theyre girlfriends, he will then send them a message, and will see if they will cheat on theyre boyfriend. 

The video series is ""i dm'd my subscribers girlfriends""

She’s one of my best friend’s sister. I know her whole family and they love me. The only problem is that she (28f) has been done wrong by men her entire life. Her ex-husband (3 years together, married for 1 of them) was a heroin addict and a drug dealer. He was manipulative and verbally abusive and definitely hurt her several times. Her step father molested her when she was 5 years old. Im sure a lot of other things have happened, but we’ve only recently started having these really personal conversations. I’m a very cool headed person, I really care about her, and I’ve had a crush on her since we first met. But, I tried not to make much of it because a rocky relationship would mean that I’d lose several friends. But, she called me out of the blue and initiated the dating. I was pumped about it! With that said, she’s been very cautious about opening up to me for obvious reasons. Im not sure how she feels about sex as it seems to be something that hasn’t always been fun for her. Im not going to make my physical needs her responsibility. Im perfectly fine with taking care of myself should the need arise. Id be mortified if I ever found out that she was having sex with me just to please me. We have had sex once, but we were a little drunk. I would hate to think that her fears might make her feel the need to loosen up before being comfortable enough for intimacy. What would you do to help someone know that you’re not there to take anything from them or use them like others had done in the past? This is the first woman that I’ve ever felt completely relaxed around and I’m able to be myself. I want this to progress into something long lasting. I want her to be as excited as I am about it. I know I’m going to need to be patient and let her move at her own speed. Are there questions I should/shouldn’t ask to get a healthy conversation going? She’s my date for NYE and we’re probably having a nice hungover NYD together. So I should get a chance to have some good talks with her.

This is because she's been working at the gym I go too and we'd make small talk every now and then. Things only got serious after I got a job there too, 3 months ago, and we decided to start working out together. Around that same time we started ""dating"", we both agreed to keep things between us since we didn't want anyone else we both worked with knowing. I thought this was a good choice because after one of our dates she accidentally gave me a hickey and the whole staff clowned me for it.

We continued talking every day non stop while working out together and occasionally getting food and stopping by to say hi when each other worked. A couple weeks in she started calling me her boyfriend around her friends and said that we were dating out of nowhere. I took this as a sign that she wanted to make things official. She also bought me a #1 Dad hat so I thought I'd shoot my shot. When I found time to go on another date (we both have really hectic schedules) I asked if she wanted to go to the lake after we worked out. While we were cuddling by the lake I asked if she was comfortable with me calling her my girlfriend and telling my friends (not the critters at work) that we were dating, she said yeah with no hesitation. A small note is that I have a hard time forming relationships and attachment. My therapist says I have EAD (emotional attachment disorder) and severe depression, but I think if you wanted to you can slap a disorder or a mental illness on a lot of things so I never really bring it up. Since really the only times it affects me is with my parents, idk why but I don't love them or my brother for that matter. I have no idea why, I talk to my friends about it and they think I'm a psychopath and I constantly feel guilty for not appreciating the people who are the reason Im alive.

This is only relevant because a week after I popped the question, she asked If I was mad at her. And I explained the situation and told her it'll just take some time for me. She graduated early so on the last day of school (that we both got to skip cause were seniors and exempted out of finals), she invited me over to her house to spend the evening. We made a movie list and so we got through G-force and a couple episodes of clone wars before she asked me to come to her room. I don't think I have to explain what happened, but after we both were sitting in her parent's hot tub and talking and she told me she was bi. I have no problem with this, but I kinda got weirded out when she told me that I was probably her last guy that she'll ever date. Also side note I didn't nut, idk why but after like 3-4 hours of trying I told her that I was done and she was kinda sad cause she thought it was her fault or something stupid.

Today Im working out since Im off, and its second time this week she told me that she wanted to work out with her friend. I have no problem with this since she presented a valid reason that she hasn't talked or hung out with her in months. What I didn't like is that she didn't bother saying hi or shit or even approach me, just acted like I didn't exist or some shit. Also I was pissed today cause I went for a 450 deadlift pr and stopped an inch of the ground, like wtf what happened to the easiest part was getting it of the ground. Anyways, Im at the corner of the gym where all the racks are and I haven't been paying attention to her since I wanted to get my main lifts out of the way before I start getting distracted. One of my good friends that I consistently lift with, tells me that she keeps staring at me. I tell him I'm ignoring her rn cause I have to finish this main set. She comes up to me and asks if her friend can borrow some chalk. I asked what for and she said for lat pull downs, I told her that's a waste of chalk you don't need it for a machine. She walks away kinda mad. I continue lifting and finish up and start my accessory work. While Im putting away my weights, one the guys that I've seen there a while and grew up with (we went to the same elementary, middle, and high) comes up to me. He told me that he broke up with his girlfriend yesterday. I told him that sucks dude shit happens. He continues talking and was like yeah these two girls walked up to me while I was in the middle of lifting and asked for my snap. Im like oh shit that's kinda fucked since you just broke up with your girl, but I didn't care to much. He's a D1 football player that's like 6'4"" 250lbs, so I rationalize that he doesn't have to much trouble in the market. He keeps talking though, and he tells me one of my friends told him that my girl and her friend that were working out together were the ones that asked and he told me that he ought to tell me out of respect.

Thats when alarm bells start to ring in my head, so I asked her which one asked. He said the one with curly black hair with leggings and a crop top. I was like ah fuck, so he pulls up his snap to confirm and there she is. All my friends that were working out stop what they were doing to come talk to me about it. I didn't mind it cause I needed the outside thoughts to rationalize what to do next. Out of all the talking they came to a conclusion, she had the audacity to ask for another guys snap while I was working out at the same time. I'm pissed, but I don't wanna be impulsive so I go downstairs where she's eating with her friend and I ask if she can talk in private. I asked her why she asked my friend for his snap. I didn't want to jump to conclusions since it could have been harmless, maybe she was getting it for one of her friends or some bullshit like that. She asked me why is it a problem. I told her that I thought we were dating. In her words, "" I didn't know it was an exclusive type thing."" I didn't react, Im numb as fuck so I told her, ""What did you think it was your that one that said we were dating"". She replied, "" I should have been more clear about what I said, I'm sorry. "" I summarized with, ""Ok, well I don't think we should continue with whatever this is anymore"". She counters, ""So are we still a thing or do you wanna be mutual friends."" I told her, ""Sorry I don't think I wanna maintain a relationship with you. She says, ""Oh ok, I don't know what to say. Im sorry."" I decide I didn't wanna prolong this conversation so I said, ""Its fine you can leave now, also I want my hoodie and shorts that; Bring it to the gym whenever your working and give it to Conner (One of my friends that works with me and is aware of the situation). She walks away, and I decide to go back upstairs and continue working out. My friends asked me if there's any news, and I told them that I ended things. She came back upstairs to look for me, but I avoided her in the restroom. So I have no idea what she wanted.

Im home now dreading the tmw since we both work together. Which comes to the actual question. How do I make things not weird? How do I help her move on, so that it's not weird ? Also for further reference I have since blocked her on all forms of digital communication, deleted any pictures I have of her. Kept the cologne she bought me, cause its kinda nice. She apparently asked a mutual friend that works with us to see how I was doing, and the mutual friend told me that she still wants to be together. I kinda feel bad dropping her so quickly (not really), but I don't tolerate anything of that sort.

I’ve heard this from a few friends. That this is real. I’ve also been told sometimes I need to settle and that it’s not going to be easy out there for me because I keep getting older.

I took risks with them and obviously didn’t work for the better. I don’t see anything to question about this person. 

I remember talking to a guy friend years ago about the girl he was dating and he told me he was going to marry her but she didn’t know it yet. That he knew he was going to marry her 4 months in and prior to that her always liked/been attracted to people but never felt that “holy shit,” feeling. I’ve had a friend move halfway across the country for someone they met one weekend while on a business trip “because he knew.” So I’ve heard this happening, I want to hear your stories!

(before this whole encounter, i was a virgin. never dated a girl nor kissed one)

eventually she comes over and we are just talking (i’m being very awkward bc i’m very new to this) and eventually she asks me if i’m a virgin and if i’ve had my first kiss. i replied saying yes and no and we started talking about random stuff around my apartment and eventually she says she wants to watch a movie. we go to the living room and i put on a stand up show from netflix and she calls me over to the couch where she is laying and i have my first kiss. eventually, things start to progress and i lose my virginity to her. since then, we’ve met up twice in a parking lot close to both of our homes bc i’m back at my parents house and we just cuddle and talk and have done oral stuff. 

i’m really started to like this person but i’m not sure where we stand. i’ve watched videos on youtube about this and some have said you should ‘date’ a girl for a couple of months and more or less, if the sex is good, ask her to be your girlfriend 3 months into dating her.

I don’t know but the whole thing threw me off then i later find out from a mutual friend she is really into me but has her guard up and it takes time for her to open up but she never said this to me. 

We kept in contact and continued to talk everyday like normal other than making plans to meet up. 

We bumped into eachother a couple of months after the awkward conversation and ended up going on a date and she stayed over and we slept together again but the next day when she left her texts came across i don’t know short and not trying to make conversation just a bland “was good to see you” that was it even after a great night. So I became short with her and took a while to reply to the point she double texted me then when I replied she ghosted me for a month. 

A month later she came back around trying to make plans to meet up, then one night she was in my town but I already had plans with a group of friends so I told her I would meet up if I was free and she text me later that night to meet her at a bar and I ghosted her i felt bad I couldn’t leave my friends so rather than it be awkward I ignored her text. 

Anyway she text me again a couple of days later I replied and she basically ended the conversation. 

So I contacted her on Christmas just wishing her merry Christmas and she just said merry Christmas back and we haven’t spoke since.

I am just here to see what outsiders think of this situation I know we both chat to other people but she seems to always be around but it’s always confusing as I Imagine it must be for her with how things get handled. 

When we was dating our connection was crazy I had never felt this with anyone and she agreed she hadn’t to so I am thinking is there something between us pulling us back together or is the situation effed up.
