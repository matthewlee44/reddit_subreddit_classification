There is so much info out there about what to do and what not to do.

For context: I'm in university. 

When I initially meet a girl I like, say in a dining hall or something, should I be flirting with her/complimenting her immediately? To what extent? 

Also typically if the converstaiin went okay, I try to get the girl's number at the end by just asking ""are you down to hangout sometimes?"" And if they say yes I usually follow up by asking for their number. Is this how I should be doing it? Or am I supposed to be more direct and say something like ""can I take you out to dinner sometime?""

Then typically after I get her number I text her often like you would a friend (soft/casual flirt maybe too). And after a bit i ask if she wants to get dinner. I dont frame it as a date or anything. Other times mabye its to boba or bowling or something random. In all cases I don't frame it as a date. Should I be? I'm worried if I frame it as a date, they would say no - after all we probably have met like only once before.

Then after a bit of that I ask her out by saying something like ""do you want to go out?"" In person.

Is this a good way of doing things? My success is 0% but I know this dating thing is rough so idk if it's related to the way I apporach dating (outlined in this post) or if its just being unlucky (in the sense that maybe she's just not into me).",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162696,public,self,What steps do you follow when dating/what do you do when you see a girl you want to date?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t5eapk/what_steps_do_you_follow_when_datingwhat_do_you/,no_ads,0.0,,,

I’m 22 met a girl 18. She’s about to be 19 in a couple weeks. 

I’ve been single for about a year and a half. Last relationship was 3 years long, so I took my time to heal and started to meet girls around 7 months after my break up. During the time I was meeting around no girl really caught my attention to take it to the next level. It’d only last a bit and I wouldn’t really care or it’d just be quick hookup. Couple weeks ago I met a girl. We’ll call her madison, I saw her profile randomly on Facebook and just shot my shot. We agreed to a movie date and it was amazing from the second I saw her. She was beautiful, funny, energetic I finally found something I thought tbh I wouldn’t feel again. 

Last weekend, we went out to a dance that was in our city. We originally just agreed that if we see eachother cool if not then oh well. Since the dance was big. So I didn’t really consider it a date. However as soon I got there she asked where I was she told me to meet her up. And I hung out with her the whole night. We danced, talked, ate food, kissed it was like she was my girlfriend. 

Towards the end of the night about the last 40mins of the night we were getting tired and we just sat down at the stands. But she felt off, not as flirty, wouldn’t hold my hand, on her phone. Etc. I asked her what was wrong but she said she was just tired. I kinda understood it was 1am and we been dancing all night. 

She leaves before I do and all she does is shake my hand at the door and leaves with her friends and family. I didn’t wanna over think so I let it be. She still texts me on her way home and so that made me feel like everything was good. 

She even texts me first in the morning but I ask her again if everything was okay. She confesses that at the end of the night she started thinking of the memories in that same location she was at with her ex. Mainly the bad ones and how tbh she feels she isn’t ready for a relationship but she had a good time. At times I almost felt she wasnt over her ex. She would at times mention her past relationship and say how she doesn’t want it to be like that. We even talked about not talking about ex’s too but at times she’d do it anyways. 

My response to her was that I’m sorry she felt that way and I thought we had a good time but I can’t keep going on either if she can’t move on from her past. 

Her reply was that she’s trying to move on past that but she hasn’t and wants to fully recover when she dates again. And that she did have a good time with me and did enjoy me. I left that on read and never replied it’s been 4 days. I was too hurt and just felt like arguing to stay with me even if she can’t move on from her ex would just make me look dumb. 

She’s posting sad songs and posts on social media. Lots that reflect about specifically me. 
Was I wrong, I’ve screwed up relationships before but I felt I had to get out of this one. I thought we were both on the same page since we actually talked about how we did wanna potentially date if all goes well. So I felt I wasn’t just some dude to pass time with.

I'm 25 (Arab) and i've been dating my bf (White) for 2.5 years and before that we were Bestfriends for about 6 years. 
I'm originally from a country where you don't mingle with foreigner. My parents have been living in Germany for 30 years (and i was born there)..but since they kept the aspect about not mingling with ""foreigners"" they've never met my boyfriend (even if we've know each other for more than 8 years). 

On to the problem: 
In my culture it's still kind of normal for parents to mingle in your personal affairs even as an adult.. for example Marriage. 

My extendet Family has been asking my parents about getting me married because i'm almost 26. My parents now told me to try and find an arab guy .. because i've still got time till i'm 26. And they always tell me that i'll only be happy with an arab guy and that they'll only be able to have a strong bond with an arab family because of cultural diffrences. 

Sooo... They're basically telling me to keep dating my bf if i rrally want to .. but still search for an arab guy who suits my parente taste...which i'm quitr sure is cheating and morally extreamly wrong. 

Now I dont plan on breaking up with my bf.. i'm actually wuote sure that i'll end up marrying that guy. 

But what should i do with my parents ?
They're not going to stop &amp; i dont want to go low contact with them because of my younger siblings who still live with them. 
And i know that now that i'm 25 i'll be having this conversation at least oncr a week and will only get worse.

Body? Check. I've been weightlifting for the past 18 years 5 days a week. Very fit and muscular.

Height? Okay, I'm average height and maybe this is where it all goes to shit... but it shouldn't!

Dick size? Check. Trust me ;)

Personality? Check. I enjoy talking to and meeting new people, am always complimented on my sense of humor, and am not a douchebag especially when it comes to my treatment of others. I put the effort in to engage in conversation as well.

So, in 2019 i moved from my city to another one to study journalism (i moved from Salvador-Bahia to Porto Alegre-RS). It was a awful city, economically broke, full of racists and xenophobes (they hate people from my region of Brazil), and most young people wanted to leave. I was making my mind about leaving, then i met this girl. She was 4 years older than me, doing a masters degree on literature (while i was still in my bachelors, since i had to stop school to do a liver transplant); so she was really smart, sexy, gorgeous and even good in bed. Needles to say she was my type; i remember saying this to her, and she said i wasn't her type but that she liked me a lot. 

But i didn't think straight at that time, and left because the racism and xenophobia was turning me into an angry person, and also because i thought i was never going to get a job in that economy. Now i'm at a better city but i'm almost finising my graduation without a internship. We tried to make it work, i visited her and she visited me once, but then pandemy came. We facetimed a lot but eventually we endend up having some fights because of jealousy (she to me and me to her) and also because we missed each other a lot (we were long distance). I did ended up trying to get back with her but she refused; i dreamt of her for 4 months. I don't know now if i still miss her, or if i'm just sad because i think i'm never going to meet someone like her again, and if i do, she will not like me.

Please help me, what do i do?

The first night we hooked up, we saw each other and slept in each other's rooms for the rest of the semester. We did not know each other before we hooked up for the first time. I had gotten out of a relationship a month prior, and my intention wasn't to get back into a relationship for a while. That being said, within two weeks of hooking up and seeing each other almost everyday, I had made out with another guy for 1 minute, on two separate occasions. When I realized that I started to like my boyfriend, I never hooked up with the second guy again. My boyfriend recently asked me if I had done anything with anyone since the first time we hooked up, and because I felt like I had nothing to hide, I straight up told him about the other guy. He broke up with me. 

I argued that because it was so soon into us hooking up, and since we never had a ""talk"" about being exclusive, I thought I was free to do what I wanted to do. And because of that, I didn't think I had to tell him about the other guy. He said that because we were automatically hanging out everyday, that a ""psychological contract"" was made between the two of us that we were exclusive. If he had communicated that to me instead of assuming, I would have told him that at that point I was not ready to be in a relationship and that I cannot be exclusive with someone at that point, and we would've gone our separate ways. But he never communicated with me, he only assumed that we were exclusive, which I do not think is fair to me. He came off as a f\*ck boy to me, so I had assumed that we were just friends with benefits at that point. 

He is also upset about the fact that after kissing the other guy, I slept over in his room the same night. I understand that was scummy of me and I apologized, but other than that, it does not feel fair that I am being punished for something that wasn't even bad. And side note, I wasn't hooking up with the guy on his own. Me and my best friend at the time were drunk and were flirting with him together, and made out with him together. My boyfriend has never cared about me kissing my girl friends, and I wasn't hooking up with the guy for the guy, I was doing it because me and my girl friend liked to be devious together. 

Might I add that last year, we were broken up for a month. However, he was leading me on to think that we were going to get back together (telling me his parents were getting me a gift for christmas, talking about what we were going to get each other, still hanging out and talking all the time, etc.). One night, he disappeared for hours and long story short, after pressing him about the details for hours on end, he went over to a girls house, they watched a movie together, she was a little cuddly, and then she tried to kiss him. He didn't kiss her back and left shortly after. I had to threaten him to tell me the whole story, and he continuously kept saying that he was telling me the full story, before he would cave and tell me more details. 

That was 10 months after being in a committed relationship with each other, and I forgave him for that but he can't forgive me for something I did two weeks into us hooking up. I am not looking for the ""you dont deserve him"" and ""let him go"" comments, but when I searched up other posts about ""are we exclusive if we didn't have the talk"" and showed him that people agree that it is something that needs to be communicated and agreed on, he said that ""our situation is different, no one knows it like us so we cant use random opinions like that"" so here I am, explaining the situation so I can get actual feedback.

I have been in two major relationships in my life - the first with a friend of mine from high school who I have been on and off with since junior year, and the second (lasted about a year) with a guy I met off of Tinder during one of my “off” periods with my high school ex. Needless to say, both of these relationships were unhealthy in their own ways; the first lacking any sort of commitment or stability and the second rife with mistrust due to the fact that my high school ex is in my friend group. In all honesty, I can’t even say for sure if I’ve ever been in love. As of about a month ago, I decided that if I want to be successful in dating I need to change my situation. So, even though my ex has always been a good friend of mine and remains in my friend group, I needed to cut him out of my life for good. I blocked him (after breaking things off in person) and left the friend group chat. I have hung out with some of my friends in this group since then and they are aware of the situation, and for now I only plan to hang with them as long as my ex is not there. 

Fast forward to today. I still have days where I miss my ex, mainly because we really were just such good friends and he encompassed so much of my life, but also partly because I think I enjoy being with someone in general to stave off loneliness/boredom. I initially had the goal of remaining single for a while - I’ve been focusing on school, work, working out, and spending time doing activities I enjoy. In general I would say I’ve been happy. So then here comes the confusing part. I recently (actually prior to breaking things off with my FWB) reconnected with a guy who, funnily enough, went to my middle school. I didn’t really know him back then and the only reason we found each other now is because I happened to see him at a local event in our hometown. I had always found him attractive, and the brief interaction was so lovely I ended up asking for his number through a friend of a friend later that week. There wasn’t any intention behind it, I just enjoyed talking to him and wanted to keep the conversation going, although in retrospect I think part of me saw the potential for more there. Ultimately, texting turned into him asking me out for an unofficial date.

We’ve hung out four times now and at this point I just don’t know what to do.  From the beginning, I made it clear I don’t really know if I’m looking to be in a relationship and he was okay with that; I even told him about my high school ex still being in my current friend group and he didn’t appear phased, he just asked if I planned on going back to my ex again and after I said no he told me he wasn’t worried. I am assuming the reason for his quick-to-trust nature is that he has never been in a relationship, and hasn’t really had much experience with women in general from what he’s disclosed to me. It’s really shocking to me that he hasn’t pursued anyone seriously yet as I would say he is definitely conventionally attractive. He has even told me stories of girls blatantly trying to flirt with him in public, but he just wasn’t into them. And to top it off, he is probably one of the sweetest guys I’ve met - he’s just gone above and beyond to make me feel special in the short time we’ve been talking. Our dates have been fun and pretty easy going; we talk and laugh the whole time, although he does make me really nervous - moreso than I’ve ever been with a guy before. I find myself thinking about him randomly throughout the day. And I already feel so secure in knowing that he’s interested in me, so there is no guessing. Our last date he kissed me goodbye and it left me feeling giddy. I haven’t had a crush this bad on anyone in years, not even at the start of my second relationship.

But, even though I may feel this way right now, I also recognize that I may not be mentally ready to jump into another relationship, let alone with someone like him. I am afraid his naivety to dating is blinding him from seeing the baggage I would be bringing into a potential relationship. Part of me is also afraid I only feel this way as a coping mechanism to stay away from my ex. My past dating experience in general has sort of cultivated a mindset in which I really struggle to open up, both romantically and intimately. I am not really used to receiving or giving sweet things, and cutesy gestures, even in private, have always been hard for me, even if I picture these things in my “dream” relationship. Meanwhile, this guy took the time out of his day to leave a single rose outside my door on Valentine’s day while I was out drinking with my friends. Basically, I just don’t want to fuck up this guy’s first dating experience as he seems like such a good, kind-hearted person. I honestly don’t feel good enough for him. I also don’t want to depend on being in a relationship to be happy, and I am afraid not taking some time to just be single will prevent me from growing as a person.  Finally, since I have cut things off with my longterm FWB so recently, I almost feel guilty pursuing anything with this new guy. Should I end things before it gets more serious? 

TLDR; I have really struggled in past relationships and I don’t know if I’m ready to be in a new one. I really like this guy, but he’s new to dating and I feel like I’m gonna ruin this if I pursue it further.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162707,public,self,I feel like I’m going to mess this up and I really really don’t want to,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t5hxsf/i_feel_like_im_going_to_mess_this_up_and_i_really/,no_ads,0.0,,,

I'm a 27 yo gay guy. For some reason, I think that everyone is better than me. To be blunt, if I'm alone, I honestly believe I'm attractive, nice, smart, but that all goes out the window when I'm amongst other people. I have a huge inferiority complex where I automatically elevate people above myself. When I meet someone, I think I have to prove myself to them. I never look at us as equals.

It hurts me in many aspects of life, but the most when it comes to flirting. I never, *ever* flirt with anyone because I'm too petrified they'll reject me--why would they want to be flirted with by me when they're so cool/hot/smart/etc? It's wild because the person can legit not even be that cool/hot/smart/etc, but my brain will just amplify them to put them above myself. There are times when I'll look back, months later, on an interaction I had with someone and be like ""wait...I'm *way* cooler than them, but I was literally trying so hard to prove myself back then.""

From the time I came home to a female in my bed to most recently him on a dating site. Hes not just you're normal cheater thou. Being honest hes not all that attractive. He cheats buy paying women $ or targeting less diserable women. Everytime it's the same story, I'm sorry. Of course I know that's not sincere.

I (19) My boyfriend (21) of 5 years has had a female friend who he’s always been close to. He’s worked with her, went to school with her, and they have mutual friends. In the past my boyfriend would ditch or hang up on me if let’s call her Leslie would call him while we were on the phone. He would also always talk about her and even gave her random little gifts for her birthday and holidays. I never thought much of it, but somewhat grew a bit of jealousy since he would hangout with her behind my back. They stopped texting each other in 2020 however I never got the courage to check his phone because I always felt like I didn’t have a reason to and I didn’t want to invade his privacy. However, last summer I decided to check messages between them and I found so many pictures that they would send to each other from growing up, present pictures, two pictures of them at a restaurant. I also looked through their messages and came across a private note! I tried getting into it however, I couldn’t access it at all. I tried so many passwords but nothing worked. We did have an issue whenever we would talk about how I didn’t feel comfortable with him and Leslie texting each other back in 2020 however, he didn’t say much about it. Yesterday I met with a friend and she told me how her parents have been having an issue bc to her dad has been talking to a lady behind her mother’s back. This made me reflect on my relationship and I thought of how communication and trust is important. It also made me realize that I don’t want to go through a similar situation like her parents. Would I be the ass hole for bringing up the private note to my boyfriend? It’s always been lingering at the back of my head I trust him but not fully because of that reason. Moreover, I’ve been meaning to bring it up ever since I confronted him about messages between him and Leslie but I was just too afraid to find out and I didn’t want him to think that I don’t trust him. So reddit, I’m hoping the best since I’ve always seen this man as my true love and have always pictured a future with him.

I didn’t want to get into a relationship or even really connect with anyone until I met someone I thought was perfect. Well, after a very long and toxic relationship, i am single once again.  


I really loved my ex, but she was very cruel to me and to give an example of the sorta stuff I’m talking about: on many occasions if she didn’t get her way (for example, if I refused to buy her a vape pen cartridge) she would kick the passenger side door open and just plant her leg to where the door would stay wide open, even if we were going like 70 mph on the highway. She was sick and needed help, but i spent many years protecting her from very self destructive behavior. She would cut herself, burn herself with cigarettes, and hit herself, hit me scream bloody murder till 430am and then fake a seizure at the end of the episode and then pretend nothing had happened. I only say fake a seizure after being the one person in her life vouching for the validity for her ailments, often times this created conflict between me and her family and friends.  


The relationship finally ended after I saved her once again from a very dangerous living situation, letting her move in with me (after I had a few months to get my life somewhat normal. Fixed my credit got a new car etc.) all her stuff started up again and I decided not to react but she kept going. I felt trapped but like I had a responsibility to protect her. I had almost become homeless before getting into my latest apartment because I was paying her rent and not my own for about two years. Her father is very wealthy yet refused to financially support her. He was very familiar with her episodes. I was doing everything I could to keep her from becoming one of those people on the side of the road living in a tent or a car. I felt like I had to protect her from herself, really.  


Well in October, she went to stay at her dads who lives about 45 min from me. I really liked her dad but over the last few years, I realized that being on good terms with her father meant that he would at times side with me in conflicts when it was apparent that she was abusing the situation. This just made her hate me, obviously. I purposefully cut her family out of my life so that she could have them solely on her side. This is important for the next part.  


She then went to stay with him and her two siblings for the last bit of October until thanks giving. I was very supportive of this. I wanted her to grow closer to her family and build that support mechanism. Eventually she called and said she would be staying through Christmas, I told her it was a great idea, and that I hope things between her and her family were getting better.  


A week later she called and said that she got a job at a movie theatre. She hadn’t worked a single day we were together, due to her apparent illness. I asked what was going on and she gave no real response. She told me we had already been broken up for several months and that she was in another state. Her father just a few weeks ago picked up all her things at my place. I was a little nervous as I had no idea how she had been portraying me to her family, who I respect greatly. A tear came to his eye and he gave me a hug. We got lunch and he eventually told me that he had only seen her for one or two days throughout the last four months. This was the last piece of the puzzle, I realized that she had been cheating on me with someone she met online. That was the only thing I couldn’t find a way to forgive. I finally began to let go of the flawed vision I had of who she was. I am not a woman hater. Every time I bring up this situation to my own father or people I look up to I get “that’s how woman are” but that’s just not true. She had issues that at times were extremely dangerous.  


I honestly don’t really want to dive any deeper into thinking about this, it makes me feel shitty.  I just want to give a decent picture of what I’m used to at this point.  


I decided that I want to try dating. I know it’s kind of early after such a long and tumultuous relationship, but after realizing she had manipulated me in such a way, I grew desperate to reclaim my life. I don’t want to lose anymore time from this stuff. There’s only one problem.  


I have no idea how to meet women. I attract women at my job, or when I play gigs, and am apparently seen as handsome(I don’t see it). I just don’t know how to connect with people beyond initial contact. I get opportunity after opportunity with beautiful women, but my self image is just so low at this point that I push people away, and sabotage any chance I have at further connecting with anyone.  


I’ve never been to a bar I didn’t play music at. I don’t go out unless it’s a gig. Due to Covid, I haven't had that avenue of meeting people for a little while. There are a few women who are very interested in me, but they are between 18-20 and I think that’s just to big of an age gap.

Anyways, I've posted on here before, revealing that I wanna get back on the dating scene. But there's one thing holding me back that ISN'T Omicron. It's my height. I'm 5'6/167 cm, so I'm a short man. And as some of us know, most women prefer tall guys. I'm not bitter about my height, but knowing the fact that I stated earlier makes me anxious as all fuck about dating and trying to find someone. And seeing some videos on YouTube about male height and dating really didn't help with that. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I can understand why height is important for women. Being with a tall man makes women feel small, feminine, and protected. Short girls feel small and protected, while tall girls who insecure about their bodies get to feel feminine. The latter isn't all--probably not even most--tall women, but still. Add to that the conflicting advice people give out: ""Just go for short gals!"" and ""Taller gals don't care as much if the guy is short."" and that makes things a bit confusing.

&amp;#x200B;

But what makes this so damn ironic for me is my type is either (physically) strong women and tomboys/masculine women--so I'm not even looking to be a protector in the first place! I'm not even looking for someone who I can ""throw around"" and dominate. I'm looking for a girl who's masculine/boyish and/or physically capable! So I feel anxious AND stupid.

Long story short, we were very good friends years ago but the timing wasn’t right. Our connection never died and we’re not giving it a shot. 

He has a set 8 hour job and I’m self employed so I’m able to set my own hours. Prior to us dating, I’d split my work between some hours during midday and the rest in the evening giving me free time to have a productive morning, decent lunch break as well as free time for personal errands/leisures. Since we’ve began dating, I’ve somewhat adjusted my hours to better suit his schedule as his is a set schedule. All in all, it works out but I have cut back a few hours in the evening meaning a slight curve to my income. Although it is not a problem for me and my personal finances, he is aware of this. 

Today while chatting on the phone, we were joking about “allowances” and I mentioned I needed an allowance to get my nails done. His response was “If you want an allowance, then give yourself one.” Like I said, we were both joking but to be honest, his response did irritate me. He is aware that I’ve accommodated my schedule to allow us more time together and that this means I have slightly less free spending money. Now don’t get me wrong, I am not expecting him to give me an allowance but I think his immediate response just rubbed me the wrong way. 

So, I was thinking about how I should continue working my routine schedule and perhaps only adjust it 1-2 days a week. Now, I will have to have this conversation with him as he is aware that I am able to set my own hours. I want to be firm about my schedule while explaining that this is my income to be able to keep up with my lifestyle, however I don’t want to come off as petty. I know this stems from the nails conversation but I general it just made me reflect on my time and expectations. Like I mentioned, I’m not expecting him to pay for me to treat myself but the comment just stung given that he knows I’ve tailored my schedule for us.

I didn’t say anything to him throughout the semester, until our last class. I gave him a small compliment on his group project the day of our final presentation. He just smiled and thanked me, and I left thinking I’ll never see him again. 

Few weeks later my friends and I stumbled upon a restaurant by chance, and to my very big surprise, we found him working there as a waiter. We ate there twice. The first time, I was too shy to say anything(I’ve also never approached a guy before and am a generally shy person when it comes to meeting someone new.) The second time was a couple months later… and this time, I somehow found the guts to go up to him. The restaurant was almost closing and he was the only one at the cashier, so after I payed, I asked him if he remembers me from the class we had together, and he replied saying he remembers seeing a face familiar to mine. He also smiled at me before I scurried away with my heart in my throat.

I don’t know if he finds me attractive or creepy. I wouldn’t say I’m the prettiest girl out there, he might even be a little out of my league, but dammit he’s cute. And from what I observed he’s a really sweet guy as well. I know that he’s single (a friend of a friend told me, but we’re not close enough to use the connection for help.)

My friends are planning to eat at that restaurant again soon, any advice on what I should do? I’d like to be friends, if anything, I want to get to know him better as a person. 
Should I not say anything anymore to not come off as creepy? Should I say something? Should I back off if he won’t approach me because he’s not interested?

Last year back in November we matched no Tinder, but I only messaged her last week. At first she didn't recognise me but as I started talking she started remembering. 

Anyway, she told me she works a few blocks from where I live, so we planned to meet her after her shift on Friday. Everything went so well I asked if she wanted to see me again on Saturday, to which she replied yes. We met again on Sunday. Sometimes we were at her place, sometimes at the mall, at sometimes my place and sometimes just walking around. We had some deep conversations about our views on politics, science, the state of the world and stuff, we had A LOT in common (like we both had just started studying German), she's just so goddamn pretty and cuddling with her was awesome. Our dates would last for many hours and stuff. Naturally, I just wanted to keep doing that. 

We had it all planned to do the same thing on Monday (or so I thought) until she texted me saying she had been invited to smoke with a friend of mine she had just met on Saturday (note: I wasn't invited but probably because I don't smoke. I found it weird tho). I asked what she wanted to do but she would't give me a straight answer, so I kept asking because not knowing what to expect makes me anxious. Also, I was at a mall in the other side of the city (I live in a big city), so I was cool not seeing her as long as made her mind before it was late.

A few our hours later she agreed to meet me. I took with me the yearbook of the year we were into each other because she looked so pretty that day and because she couldn't remember much about that year. We met at a bus stop. The conversation lasted around 20 minutes and revolved almost entirely about the yearbook. She told me she didn't like when people invaded her personal space. I apologised and said promptly explained that her action had made me extremely anxious for hours and asked her to be more transparent. I think a straight ""not today"" is better than no answer at all. Right after that she called and Uber and went home.

On Tuesday, she greeted me with a cute good morning, I asked her if she wanted to meet after her job but I was ok if she didn't because the British part of my family is here and I was going to have dinner with them. After that we didn't talk much.

Yesterday/today (Wednesday) I woke up with a wall of text on my DM. She basically said that even though I'm cute, handsome and all that stuff I invaded her personal space so that's not gonna work, she's sorry but she doesn't wanna talk to me anymore. I instinctively tried to message back, changed my mind, deleted my messages and then messaged her again, to which I got no response. I just basically apologised and even humiliated myself a little.

I kinda freaked out and started messaging some friends almost begging them to come and see me because I was feeling terrible. I managed to speak to 3 different friends (all girls) about the situation, explained everything with as much detail as I could and asked them to be as honest as possible if I did something wrong. None of them could see how I could be wrong and tried to reassure me it's not my fault, but I can't help but feel like shit.

Usually if a girl loses interest in me I just move on and don't pay much attention to it. This time I'm feeling devastated and I don't know exactly why. I kinda feel like I've found the perfect girl but I fucked it all up even though everyone keep saying it's not my fault.

I would have hard time believing these stories of someone told them to me. 

Anyway, my friend is 32, lives in a small town with mom, low income. He looks above average and is tall (184 cm id say), unfortunately his personality is a bit tame. He's kind, 'soft', quite boring. He's a good guy and person but there's no spark in him. Last time he was in a relationship was probably 2012. 


But in the last 3 months he had 2 girlfriends which is very prolific. 

Girl #1. 32 on tinder, 36 in real life. One day he sends me a link to twitch stream and says to watch it. I do and wow - the stream is about streamer's tinder adventures. And one of the girls he's chatting to is my friend's tomorrow date. They weren't officially together yet but it was going to be their 3rd or 4th date, so the interest was there. And with some insane coincidence my friend is a follower of a streamer who matched with the same girl. Like wow, what are the odds?? And he tortured himself by watching it. They spent a couple of months officially dating (doubt they even kissed) and broke it off. 

Girl #2. Just 3-4 weeks after he became single again he said he started dating with a girl from his town (they bonded over dog ownership). He was happy, she seemed like a better person and match for him. That was just about 10 days ago. When he said she was a fan of my favorite team something clicked (fan of my team, black and white photos, from small town where my friend lives) and I went to my screenshots folder and sent him one from 2017 where I matched with her lol (he sent me her profile back then to show her profile pic - she was at my team's stadium), she was far away so I swiped just to express my respect. Anyway, just another case of a small world. 

Yesterday suddenly she messaged him asking what he expected from their relationship etc. Told him she couldn't give him anything serious and dumped him. 30 minutes later he found her on tinder. He then time me that 2 days ago she posted on her Instagram stories something like ""installing tinder wish me luck""! I was appalled. Your boyfriend is following you and you post shit like this? It's sociopathic, id go nuclear on her but my soft friend just chewed it up.

Longtime lurker, first time poster. 
This post was sparked in my head by one complaining about men holding fish or stuff they’ve hunted in online dating profiles.

Speaking as a guy, I don’t have very many pictures of myself (at least nice ones). The ones I do are taken by other people at events and get togethers and such. Most guys have probably heard the negative feedback about pictures of them holding up big fish but often, it’s their only good picture! 
The one that they’re genuinely smiling in, that it’s ok to not look great in cause it’s outdoors in the muck. And it shows a hobby that they enjoy!
Advice:don’t skip over them JUST because of that big ol’ bass.

We had talked about going to play pool the next time we see each other, which was going to be today. He texted me that he’d be free tonight &amp; I was like sweet are we still playing pool. He response to that was that he was really tired, so then I proceeded to ask what he wanted to do then, while also sending a message saying no sex- which sent in a playful manner on my part, but I was also just letting him know beforehand. He then got really mad and said that just because he’s tired, I think he wants to have sex with me. Then went on to tell me to have a good night. I was super confused &amp; sent him a text affirming that I was only setting my boundaries beforehand to avoid any sticky situations &amp; I didn’t mean it in a rude way at all.

But I’m really confused as to why he would take my comment so seriously, and if it’s a red flag from him or not. I really like him so that’s the only reason why I’m so tripped up over it. I feel bad because maybe he thinks I just assumed he only wanted me for sex, but if he didn’t want that then why would he be so mad at me for letting him know? It sucks because I thought I was doing the right thing by just shooting a playful text letting him know beforehand, because I’ve been in some ugly situations where guys tried to get more out of me than I wanted and I kind of have trauma around it.

We have a daughter who is 2 year old.I take full responsibility of cleaning diapers of our daughter as my partner is not keen on doing this which i understand as he takes care of other aspects of parenting where i lack.
When my daughter 2as around 1 year old,my partner suggested me to get a pet which i wasn't comfortable with as i am not a fan of pets but he assured me that he will take full responsibility of pet.So i agreed half heartedly for his happiness and we got persian cat.
When the cat came initially it was potty trained,so there wasn't anyissud between us but now from few months she poops and pees anywhere in the house and then cleaning responsibility comes to me which grosses me out like anything  
I have asked my partner multiple times to find a solution, either get the cat operated or give it to someone.he doesnt agree on get it operated as it is against his morals. He suggested having another cat for few days for breeding to which i agreed but then when we brought another cat for few days,they weren't potty trained and my house smelled like a public washroom which irritated me alot as it's me who had to clean all the mess which makes me pukish all the time i clean.Every time cat pees which happens 3-4 times in a day we have fights and then he labels me as a nahging partner

Shes hides her phone when she's around me and usually gets calls from different guys she claims are just friends 
Sometimes these calls come as late as 10:30pm

Shes lies about her location sometimes and even refuses to pinpoint exactly what she's going to do at wherever she is going
I ve found myself stalking her and playing detective all the time for some months now
Gaslighting is her ultimate weapon... i fall for it very often 
I broke up with her for like 3 weeks (Last 3 weeks in January)
Then we called to meet up with me and showed me a positive pregnancy test report
A week later she said she has aborted the baby which makes we feel as though the whole pregnancy story was forged
Honestly i feel like don't trust her (Words, Actions, Feelings )

What should i do?

I have been crushing on hil for a while and did a good job keeping it just kinda in my friend group, until today. My seat in the lunch room gives me a clear shot at him and I spend a lot of time just kinda watching him (I know I know). Today at lunch I was doing just that, and he smiled which melted my heart so I turned to my friend and said "" {*REDACTED*} is so cute."" And then his best friend walks by. So I freak out a bit as his friend goes right to him and they both look at me and laugh and smile. So I'm upset but the day goes on right? 

We had an assembly later that day and at the end I had to use the bathroom so I just left my bags up in the bleachers. I came back to get them and his whole friend group was still sitting there. I ignored it and grabbed my stuff and go to leave, and he follows me. So I freak out but I'm thinking, 'it's okay you walk really fast you're ahead of him.' But nope, I look over and he is right next to me. So now I feel akward and make conversation and we part ways into our classes that are next door to eachother. 

Well my class that hour wanted to go outside and I did not so I went over to the class he was in (his teacher is the theater teacher and I hang out in her room a lot). So I sit down to do my math and the whole time he smiles at me and makes eye contact with me, and I felt like it was more than normal. 

Now I'm asking, does he like me or am I just reading this wrong or is he flirting with me for kicks?
