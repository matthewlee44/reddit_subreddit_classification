1,oj3efb,1626133141,Date With Coworker,"Hey all,

I went on a date with a 18F (I am 19M) yesterday. We are both FOH at a restaurant and work alongside each other a couple times a week and have good chemistry. After a month of working together I ask her out and we have a good time I'm sure. I pick her up and her parents wanted to meet me (because she has spoken highly of me to them I inferred from her). During the date we just sat on a park bench and talked for a couple hours and she seems to be really open and honest, letting me know things you'd let a person you really trust/respect/like know. It was seriously a nice time and great memory, it felt like we were sharing a moment together.

During the second-half of the date she leaned her head against my shoulder, got cozy next to me and out her legs on my thighs, and held my hand while we were chatting. The type of stuff a girl who likes her man a lot would do. She was very forward with the getting closer together, it seemed like she really wanted to. We even made-out and got handsy a couple times (she wanted to go for longer but I am/was a little weird about PDA so I pulled away). All in all, it was a super sweet time and when I drop her off she says with a smile: ""Text me whenever."" 

She leaves to college in 6 weeks to play soccer.

I called that night and left a voicemail telling her I had a good time and would like to see her again. I texted her this morning basically saying the same thing to no response....makes me think of the song the Same Ol Situation by Motley Crue, I've been on many good dates that resulted in me being ghosted, so SOS. But this was, by far, the best one to lead to a ghosting.

I actually like her a lot and want to get to know her better. Fuck. Part of me wants to send another message, but I know deep down I walked away with a great memory from that day and not much more.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oj3efb/date_with_coworker/

3,oj3is6,1626133555,"[Serious] Ladies of reddit, would you date a guy with acne scarring? (Pics included)","This might just be one of the most important questions I've ever asked.

I struggled with moderate severity acne for awhile, the acne itself is completely gone now since about a year back but it left scarring behind, which has affected me way more than I'd like to admit. I was at absolute rock bottom not too long ago. Luckily, I began treatment for the scarring last year, and I'm being treated by the very best doctor in this area and so far got good results which I am happy with!

Now when things have improved by quite a lot I would like to get back into dating, and it's huge for me since I never thought I would be able to get this far again after how bad the scarring was. I love/like absolutely everything else about myself but this scarring is weighing me down so much and is making me feel like I don't stand a chance in the dating world.

So ladies, would you date someone with scarring like mine or is it a complete turn off? 

Incredibly grateful for any input!

We went on our first date and it wasn‚Äôt anything ‚Ä¶special (I guess?). It felt regular and I didn‚Äôt feel any sparks. I ended up telling him I think we should be friends. At first he asked if he did something wrong and seemed upset about it, then all of a sudden seemed to be 100% in agreement and told me that I‚Äôm great but I‚Äôm not the one for him and went on to say how sorry he is that he doesn‚Äôt have an explanation for me. 

After thinking about it for sometime, I think I made a mistake. I think I was just nervous and awkward cause I was scared and felt a lot of pressure and I want another date to see if things are any different. He made it clear to me that he wants a future and I feel like I didn‚Äôt give it a fair chance. We‚Äôve still been keeping in touch but I have no idea what to do or if I should even tell him how I feel. He really is a great guy and such a catch and I genuinely feel like we could be together but I feel like I ruined it cause I was being impulsive when I told him I want to be friends.

I'm 5'7-5'8ish, in decent shape, run several times weekly (and enjoy it). I'm a good guy, I dont think I have any glaring personality issues (other than maybe some self esteem issues resulting from trying to date), I have friends, male and female.

7,oj3wk7,1626134840,Is this normal on dating? (possibly NSFW but no mention of anything explicit),"I'm 27, I haven't dated never. I'm no virgin either, prostitution is legal here and I used to constantly go to brothels, talk to women with no anxiety, drink, do my thing with the lady, then leave. Untill I was 23, when I got bored of sex. So sex has been a sexual transaction to me, which I no longer care about. No love involved.

So fast forward 27 I'm openly bisexual and I'm dating a dude, my first serious dating. Things feel expectacular to me, but since I've never dated and my big group of friends either don't date or don't have partners, I don't know how to compare myself. 

Basically first day we were on one of our apartments and we slept the night, no sex, had a great time. Second time it was even better, tried to have sex but we weren't in the mood half of it (I don't do ""A"" in case you're wondering) 

So things are going great very fast. The person is way more open to me everyday that it passess. Straight out tells me the person is thinking about me and feeling nervous and I've never experienced anything like this in all my life. Honestly I don't know what to do, feel or process. Deep down, I prefer a straight relationship and have a regular family and I can't be honest about that. I want this to be serious but at the same time it feels like I'm fooling everybody.

9,oj3zko,1626135121,Miss the man I rejected months later. Need advice.,"The story starts when we started seeing each other at the very beginning of last year. We had come across eachother on tinder and matched but we had mutual friends in the past so we had already somewhat known of eachother. We went on a couple dates and it was fun, he was a nice guy, but I wasn‚Äôt fully into him for some reason. I don‚Äôt know. But we did have a damn good bond. After a couple months he had essentially asked about what we were and I pretty much rejected him. I told him that he‚Äôs nice and all and I enjoy his company but I don‚Äôt see a relationship because I wasn‚Äôt fully into him if that makes sense. I also felt like we had some differentiating goals in life that could be a problem later on (he wants to stay here in the state we are currently in but I plan to graduate and move to NYC which he hates). I told him I still want to be his friend though. And so after some time he told me that he was too into me that it hurt him just being friends and that the only way to get over it is if he cut me off completely. I still wanted to be his friend but I respected his decision.
A couple months went by and I saw him around town and asked him about an event he was a part of because I was interested in going. He invited me to come so I went then afterwards I said that I still only see him as a friend. He said he was also over me and just wants to be friends. We became friends with benefits if that‚Äôs what you wanna call it, and he swore to me that he was over me and all. Then months later the cycle repeated and he said he actually still likes me and that he can‚Äôt do it so he cut me off again. 4 months have gone by since we stopped talking and.. I miss him a lot. Sometimes I can‚Äôt sleep because I‚Äôm up late thinking about him. It‚Äôs like I feel like I‚Äôm in love with him. But I‚Äôm very confused. Because I was the one who rejected him.
My dilemma is that basically I don‚Äôt know if I miss him as a friend or if I miss him as something more. He treated me better than anyone ever has before and sometimes I can‚Äôt stop thinking about that. And we had such a good bond. But I‚Äôm scared to reach out because since I‚Äôm so unsure, i don‚Äôt want to reach out and then get the feeling again that I only see him as a friend and the cycle continues. That would make both of us feel horrible. But I also feel like I won‚Äôt be able to tell if I miss him as something more unless I do reach out to him. Another factor that makes me unsure is the fact that I recently grew apart from my best friend and now I feel very lonely. I also don‚Äôt know if the sexual thoughts I have about him are from my lack of sex these past couple months. So maybe I just want someone to talk to every night again? Or maybe I do want to pursue a relationship? Maybe I‚Äôm just horny? I don‚Äôt know. I need some advice.
And yes, I know it was wrong of me to lead him on like that in the beginning.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oj3zko/miss_the_man_i_rejected_months_later_need_advice/

A week before he was leaving everything changed between us. He was distant, dry, and every convo was pretty much surface level. I confronted him about it and he said he was talking to me less/being distant because he was going away for so long and didnt want to be serious right now. 

I agreed even though it took me by surprised &amp; he was relieved/ temporarily acting like he‚Äôs normal self but just not romantic. 
We saw each other the next day and it was like how we always are. We were flirty, he said he wanted to FaceTime me while he was gone / called me beautiful and I could see that he still liked me.

Essentially I had been seeing a FWB on and off for a while now. Initially she would come over, and her departure was dependent on her (not me) as I rarely said you have to leave now. The average time spent together was 2-3 hours. 

Later situations changed and I was coming to her place. I had a set time to leave as I didn't want to drive home to tired from the day. I averaged around 4-5 (does not include the drive) hours at their place. Sad part was, I was constantly told that I was leaving too early and it did hurt a bit because I thought I spent a significant amount of time with them. 

I changed when I came and left and then averaged around 6-7 hours (not including the drive). Thankfully, the leaving to early comment had almost disappeared. 

But it happened again with somebody else. I had gone on a date and spent morning to evening with this person and when I said I was ready to go home and I was constantly being guilt tripped into staying. 

Am I doing something wrong? Not approaching it correctly? Am I leaving too early? 

Why am I leaving? For the FWB I was just tired and had to keep things in the FWB realm. I feel like that responsibility just fell on me, so I was actively always trying to maintain that perfect balance (we all know that is never really possible). However, for the new date, I was just done for the day, tired, and wanted to retreat back home to my ""safe"" place.

25,oj521e,1626138951,Bars; optimized for minimum rejection.,"So, where I live, bars will soon be fully open for the first time in over a year. Which is, obviously, lovely. 

It also means the simplest dating option is back on the menu, and the best alternative for those of us for whom OLD does not play to our advantages.

Now, I know what you're thinking: ""I can't just go up to girls/guys and flirt with them! If I had that sort of self confidence I wouldn't be sitting here reading r/dating!"" 

Fear not my shy friends, this plan is far more laid back and inefficient than that, I too share your crippling fear of rejection.

First, you must find a bar/bars that you like, someplace where you want to hang out. Decor that's your style, plays your kinda music, and has at least one drink on offer that you really enjoy, it's better if it's at least a touch eccentric. If you don't already have a place, do some bar hopping and find somewhere that fits these criteria. 

You're going to become a regular here. Start by going in the afternoons/early evenings when there aren't many folks around and the bartenders are bored. Chat with them get to know their names and make sure they know yours. Do not try to get in their pants. They are going to be your wingmen, tip them well and consistently.

Once you know a good chunk of the barstaff, start coming/staying into the evenings when more people come out. If you're already sitting by yourself at the bar when the cute single girl/boy walks in, they're going to spot you and sit accordingly. If they're attracted to you, they'll sit near you or in your line of sight, if they're not, they won't. (This applies less and less the more full the place is, hence you want to arrive early) 

Most days, this won't happen, you'll chill at your bar, have a bit of chit chat with the bartenders and the other regulars, enjoy your beverages, and head home. 

But, once in a while, they'll sit down next to you. 

When they do, start a chat. Easy topics include the bar's menu, the weather and any sports games being broadcast on the televisions. If they smile at you while responding, escalate to offering to buy them a drink when their current one is getting low. (For women, I suggest ""So, are you gonna buy us a shot or should I?"") From there, you're basically on a date, and proceed as usual.


Now, obviously, this is horribly inefficient on both money and time; but where it maximizes efficiency is in rejections; with this method your initial rejection rate is going to be less than a tenth of what it is with OLD. 

The obvious twin to this strategy is to bar hop looking for the other people doing exactly this. You may wish to mix and match them depending on how outgoing you feel that day.  

I'm offering this as advice that is, admittedly, not terribly efficient. But is the best method I've found that doesn't feel soul crushing.

28,oj59k6,1626139710,How to date (deeper question inside),"Male, 30's.  So I think I get it overall...

Is the way to date nowadays as a male to go on multiple dates with multiple women, sleep with some of them if we're both interested, and ""take it from there""?  

In a way, seems a bit sleazy to me and I'd rather just find one great girl... but maybe this is the way to find her... by meeting many women.  

I'm not naive... I know that many many women on these dating sites, modernized women, are going on dates with multiple guys, sometimes sleeping with a bunch of them.  So I know it's not just a guy thing.  

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess the questions are... is this the way to go about dating nowadays, and at what point when you decide you don't want a relationship do you tell the woman?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oj59k6/how_to_date_deeper_question_inside/
29,oj5ixx,1626140657,"She Ended Thing Ms After the First Date, and I Have So Many Questions. Can I Follow Up?","Hey everyone. NSFW tag as this story does briefly cover a sexual encounter. 
I had a situation happen recently, and I can't stop thinking about it. Curious to know your thoughts.
 
I (M23) have not been on a date since January of 2020, as Covid very much put a halt on my desire to meet new people. 

For the couple weeks or so, I've been swiping on Bumble as I'm now vaccinated and things are finally starting to look fairly safe in my part of the world. I matched with someone on Tuesday (F25) and we had chatted for a few days before I asked to her to go out for drinks the following Saturday. She agreed, with the condition that we could have a video call prior as she had negative experiences with catfishing in the past. The call went very well (held a solid 20+ minute convo without any real awkward pauses) and we ended up going out.

The date went exceptional, and probably one of the best first ones I've ever been on. We spent around 3 1/2 hours at the bar. The entire time, we really got to know each other. We clicked on alot of the same things. We had similar family backgrounds and similar political/religious views (which she mentioned is important). We both laughed ALOT. We also mentioned to each other several times that we were both attracted to each other, and she mentioned numerous times that she wanted to go out on a 2nd, even mentioning suggestions like some movies she wanted me to watch w/ her and and that she wanted me to cook for her. 

After we left, we started walking around, and shared a few kisses. Things were feeling very natural, so I asked her if she wanted to come back to my place, and she accepted. On the walk home, I asked her if she minded if I vaped. She kinda jokingly laughed and said she didn't care for it, and I explained to her that I had quit smoking for almost 2 years and this was my cope, and that was it. I didn't think much of it. 

Wh got to my place and ended up hooking up. It wasn't like a drunk (we both only had 2 drinks), one night stand type thing though. It felt very romantic, and we had alot of very sensual flirting during, complimenting each others appearances and what not, with lots of smiling and laughing. She went home afterwards (on her own admission), and texted me on the way back saying she had a great time and would like to do something again asap. The next day (yesterday) , we exchanged a few texts basically saying it was a good night. 

Today, during work, I got a paragraph from her, which basically said ""you're a great guy and I had good time, but nicotine is a deal breaker and I don't wanna waste your time"". I let her know, that I was a little bummed since I thought things had went really, but didn't want to force her into something she wasn't uncomfortable with. We wished each other well and that's pretty much it

Am I wrong for wanting more of an explanation from her? She obviously doesn't own me anything, but I'm so confused and emotionally distraught. I really just want some closure. On one hand, I really thought there was something between us. On the other, I struggle alot with insecurities, and I really want to know if I did something that hurt her. 

I'm thinking about letting her sit and collect her thoughts for a few days, as will I. Do you think after then, it is appropriate for me to question it in a professional/non confrontational way? I don't want to press her/force to do something she's not comfortable with like I said before. I just really want to ensure that going forward, I'm not doing anything to detriment my ability have meaningful relationships, or worse, cause any wrong doings to the people I date.

42,oj6exm,1626143855,Need help Getting a girl,"So I met this girl on tinder a week ago and told her I was just down to fuck and she seems cool with that but it was very late at night so I just FaceTime to her instead and she seemed really freaking cool and so we talked for a while and then the next day we talked again and schedule to see each other the next day. She seems really interested in getting to know me and so when we got together in person I treated it like a date. During it she told me how she was coming off of a relationship that was a long-term relationship and it just ended weeks ago. She was really hesitant to tell me that but regardless it struck me as a red flag but I carried on with the date acting as if it was no big deal and so as the day went on she grew towards me a lot more even making out with me at the end for 10 minutes. She seemed interested in my personal life asking me some questions about my family hobbies work etc. and after that she continue to text me a lot the following days. I came on really strong to her until I started watching some videos on how to behave and I backed off a lot but when she reached out I asked her to see me again and she was reluctant to do so but she continue to text me but I would just tell her hey I gotta go or being nice about it. She texted me again and I asked her again to get together and she told me she had work. I really liked this girl but I knew that she came with red flags and I had to make sure I wasn‚Äôt putting myself in a bad position. So today I saw on her Instagram that she followed her ex back and I haven‚Äôt spoken to her in the last two days but now of course I imagine they‚Äôre trying to make things work again. This of course makes me extremely upset but not surprised but at the same time I have some optimism knowing myself that I can maybe make things work out down the road. Firstly she has kept me on her social media and hasn‚Äôt followed any new other guys even though I met her on tinder so I imagine she talk to other guys as well which tells me I made some type of impression even if it was minor. I also have not chased after her so from everything I hear and even putting myself in her shoes, I imagine that she at least respects me a lot and being really cool about everything. I don‚Äôt know the details of her past relationship but I think it‚Äôs only a matter of time before things don‚Äôt work out again and I really do get the signs that she does have at least very minor interest in me at the moment but she might know that if she gets past her feelings for her ex that I‚Äôm an option that she would like to explore so she‚Äôs keeping me around which I‚Äôm OK with because I can do things in the meantime that won‚Äôt affect me knowing that I‚Äôm just a back up. I‚Äôm not going to talk to her unless she reaches out to me bud I was thinking about the time when I ended a relationship with a girl and if I just wanted to hook up with a girl I would never care to know anything about her personal life and as soon as my ex hit me back up I will delete that girl off my social media because she no longer serve any purpose or benefit in my life. The only girls that I kept were the ones that I genuinely had some interest in in the ones that I really really liked were the ones that had such a busy social life and had other things going on in their life that made me want to get to know them better if things didn‚Äôt work out with my ex. Again since I‚Äôm the only guy that she is kept on her social media and I have not expressed myself as just a friend to her I think that she might have some interest in me just because if I put myself in her shoes I would only keep somebody around if I had some interest. At the same time though I‚Äôm very biased right now and I hope that‚Äôs the case but if anybody would like to share some insight and help me understand the situation better from an outside perspective and help me know exactly what I should do that would be amazing.

43,oj6frs,1626143937,"How to ""play it cool"" with a girl I'm dating?","Hello all. Ive posted about this before and want some insight for one more thing.

 I am 23, and I'm dating a 20 year old girl. We aren't exclusive and we have been on 3 dates. Our last date we played mini golf and then got smoothies. She paid for my smoothie. We went back to my place, danced in my living room, and then cuddled and watched a movie. We ended the date with a long intimate make out sesh. We made out after our first date as well. 

When we were planning this date, she told me she was down to go back to my place but wasn't ready for sex and I completely understand. The thing is, I'm getting to a point where I'm noticing that I am thinking about her more, and starting to overanalyze and overthink which I didn't used to do. 

We talked a couple days after our date. She told me that she isn't looking for anything serious, but is totally fine going on more dates and seeing me. She explicitly said that she isn't friendzoning me and wants to see me again. 

I haven't ever double texted or anything like that, I haven't shown her any signs of neediness, which is why I'm on here venting about it. 

I'm not ready to commit 100% to someone either, for I am still working on myself. I don't want to hold her to this expectation to commit to me when I'm not ready to commit either. I'm just getting excited and realizing that there is chemistry between us. 

She texts me in the morning sometimes when she knows I am stressed. She wishes me a good day and has done this multiple times. She's shown me that she cares despite not wanting to commit right now. 

I told her that what I think we're doing is great, and that id like to continue is she did. She told me ""yes i would love that"" and has hinted a wanting to take a trip with me to Austin Texas. 

I want to keep playing it cool. We don't text everyday and usually have small talk on Snapchat. We have a long streak anyway. Just basic small talk and occasional flirting. 

How can I play this cool and not screw this up? What is your insight on her thought process based off this situation?

44,oj6guj,1626144047,Dating apps have drastically lowered my self esteem.,"First and foremost, I'd like to clarify that the purpose of this post is to vent frustrations in a healthy manner and to hopefully see some hope from a helpful comment.

So I am a 22 year old man that has never been in a real relationship throughout his whole life. I've been trying online dating on and off since I turned 18. These attempts have always disappointed me since I haven't been able to have more than a two message exchange with anybody. I used to think I was ok looking but now I believe I was just deluding myself in order to feel better about myself. I get no matches at all and while I have some standards (swiping left on people who only look for hookups), I don't think said standards are that high. 

I've read some of the posts here and I have come to realize that a lot of my pictures are not good at all, but I feel bad taking pictures of myself as of recently and I'm too embarrassed to ask a friend to take a picture of me. Even if I were to get better pictures I feel like it would barely make a difference. 

I struggle to meet new people in real life as I mostly go out only to work and I'm not in college or anything. 

I have to admit that I feel somewhat bitter and angry at myself, like I'm not worth enough. That feeling of worthlessness has bled into other aspects of my life like work and family;  it is making me feel terrible. I'm young, why does meeting someone and having a connection feel like an unachievable task?

I‚Äôm still getting used to the dating scene, and talking to other girls again.  I‚Äôm talking to a few girls on Tinder and I have a date next week with a girl I used to work with.  

On Friday night, I went to a party at a neighbours house and met a girl (F22).  The funniest part is even though she was very attractive, when I started talking to her I wasn‚Äôt even thinking about trying to run game or come onto the her, I was just making friendly conversation because I‚Äôd been stood next to her without realising for over 10 minutes and I didn‚Äôt wanna seem rude.  It wasn‚Äôt until talking to her for 20 minutes or so that I realised she seemed like the type of girl I‚Äôd date. 

I asked her if she would wanna do something soon, she said she would be game and gave me her number.  

We carried on talking on and off throughout the night, then not long after the party had ended and most people were leaving, I did something that upon reflection seems incredibly stupid.  I went outside with her and basically just told her straight up that I wanted to kiss her to see if we had chemistry üòÇ  I‚Äôm never usually this forward, but like pretty much everyone at the party, I was quite drunk and I thought I‚Äôd take a shot. 

She told me that she wasn‚Äôt that type of girl and that she was staying at a friend‚Äôs house anyway.  I realised straight away that this could be interpreted as me just wanting to have sex, and I felt stupid and kind of like an asshole for proposing it.  I told her immediately that I wasn‚Äôt trying to have sex with her, and she said it was fine, but we didn‚Äôt talk again and didn‚Äôt say goodbye to each other when we left. 

I texted her the next day, said it was nice to meet her and asked if she was still interested in doing something. I also reiterated that I wasn‚Äôt trying to have sex with her and apologised for coming across as disrespectful. 

She came back to me and said that she‚Äôs really busy with university assignments and that she isn‚Äôt looking to date at the moment and was just drunk, then said sorry. 

I can‚Äôt tell if either she wasn‚Äôt interested in the first place but just didn‚Äôt want to reject me at the party... or if I had a genuine chance but screwed it up at the end. 

I don‚Äôt know why but I felt really low after receiving her reply.  She wasn‚Äôt my only option in terms of dating, and I do tend to get quite a lot of attention from girls when I go out.  I know there‚Äôs plenty of fish in the sea as they say, so I‚Äôm not sure why I was so let down at being rejected by one girl that I barely know. 

I texted her back and told her no worries and not to apologise, and wished her well with her college work and everything. 

I‚Äôm sort of tempted to message her again and ask if there‚Äôs anything that would change her mind, or if we could try just getting to know each other as friends, but my head is telling me to just suck it up and move on.  Like I said, I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm fussing so much over a girl a met at a party and barely know, but I feel like there could be something more there, maybe. 

Does anyone have any feedback on what my next move should be, and does this seem likes it‚Äôs perhaps still salvageable?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oj6ut4/rejected_over_text_after_getting_number/

I met a guy about 7 months ago and we were talking for a bit. These past two months we have been talking every day and even was able to meet up a couple of times. We flirt with each other, have chemistry, he‚Äôs even sexual towards me which I don‚Äôt mind. He FaceTimes me every night, when we hang out we cuddle and it‚Äôs always really fun spending time with him. He‚Äôs really nice and I like him. 

However we are not exclusively dating. We definitely want to take things slow and I still have trust issues from a relationship I had over a year ago. I feel like I‚Äôve been starting to get attached to this guy and possibly catching feelings but I really don‚Äôt want to be heartbroken which is also why I‚Äôve been taking things slow. I think he likes me but I‚Äôm not sure (could be just infatuation). Once we talked about talking about family if we ended up in relationships. I said that I would tell them if we eventually ended up being exclusive and he said that he wouldn‚Äôt tell his family unless he knew that person was ‚Äúthe one‚Äù. Or something like that. But that statement kind of threw me off because I think he‚Äôs unsure of me. We‚Äôve been kind of sexual but I don‚Äôt want to be a FWB and get attached to him without being in a relationship. 

I was wondering if you all think I should cut things off before I get more attached and catch more feelings for him? I really don‚Äôt want to end up being hurt and have something one-sided. Or should I wait till something like a relationship develops?

Dude is BUSY. I‚Äôm not going to get into his details, but genuinely a busy, and doesn‚Äôt have time to commit to a relationship. I stopped seeing him for a few weeks to shake off the feelings I was getting but I went back. 

Due to my job I kept getting second hand exposed to covid, so I‚Äôd take a test and get back to him. I ended up getting in a car accident and he came over that night to give me a massage and offered to help me out anyway he could. 

Around the holidays we decided not to see each other until we were both vaccinated, and I told him I didn‚Äôt want to talk during this because I‚Äôll just develop feelings. After getting vaccinated we ended up matching on tinder and getting back to it in June. 

We see each other once or twice a week and he hangs out for usually 4 hours or more and we talk about a lot. I still don‚Äôt have his number. But he‚Äôs been very sweet this whole time. 

Is it worth asking if we‚Äôre exclusive? I‚Äôm not pushing for a relationship, but if he‚Äôs sleeping with other people I want to too. I just have a strong feeling he‚Äôs not due to his schedule. He did ask me to stop giving hickies and he‚Äôs still on tinder.

""Hey baby!! wyd? i miss you, and can't wait to see you next week! What time do you get off work? :))&lt;3""

""Me too. 5pm.""

it's the usual dry ""Ok""s and ""Hey""s and stuff like that. i don't think he's uninterested in me, since he was the first to ask me out and has crushed on me for years. I also don't think he's becoming disinterested in me because our relationship has only been growing since we started dating. He still tells me he loves or misses me over text, even if its just a simple ""I love you."" He's a very shy person, but isn't so dry when he's speaking over the phone or in person (at least to me- he doesn't speak much to anyone else he doesn't know well)

But recently a stomach bug has gone around his work and he got sick. His throat has been sore, so we've been strictly texting so it didn't hurt his throat, and didn't go out on the date we had planned for today. So since we've only been texting the past few days, the way he texts has really caught my attention.

i know its a bit petty to be like this, but i wish he could keep a conversation more. Honestly, i do like that he gets straight to the point though. i showed him a little drawing i did of us the other night and asked if he liked it, and he replied with ""I like it"". nothing more, nothing less.

I do think it's helpful that he's honest and doesn't beat around the bush. And that might just be how he is. Some people are blunt, some people aren't- and that's okay. it's not a bad thing to be like that, just how people are. so i guess i shouldn't really be complaining.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oj8k0k/dry_texter_boyfriend/
64,oj8qru,1626152803,Feel like I lost any flirtatious bone in my body,"    So lately I've been growing increasingly frustrated at how much I've completely lost tge ability to flirt or even talk to someone I find attractive. I start finding people unapproachable or I catch myself fumbling to figure out how to even converse.
    Just two years ago I was able to be a very flirty person without any anxiety or worry that I'm coming off weird/creepy/a bit much. I was able to go on decent dates left and right. I was able to walk up to any girl I saw, sit with them, and just have a perfectly natural conversation without any issue.
    Over the past two years however I've basically lost this and it's finally getting to me. Before I get into this  part both my partner and I are polyamorous by nature. They have a girlfriend and multiple people they're currently romancing. I hate to say it but it's hard to watch. I love my partner with all my heart but it's hard watching them be able to do everything I lost the ability to do.
   I want to relearn how to get that back. I wanna be able to walk up to a girl and be able to just talk again. I'm grasping at how to relearn this but it feels like I've reached a point where I don't know if it'll come back any time soon.

I haven‚Äôt heard from her since then, so my question is should I initiate and send her a message through Whatsapp (we have not texted there before but I see that she is online) to check up because I cannot send international text messages if she is still abroad, or should I just wait and see whether she messages by herself at some point or not?

lemme explain.

&amp;#x200B;

Internet research has revealed that it is relatively easy to get people banned on Hinge, out of spite, jealousy, envy, showed too much douchey muscle, or too much boob, or whatever fucked up reason, and without proof. 

Yes, there are legit reasons too, but there have been countless examples where users have done nothing wrong, only to discover they've been permabanned.

if someone wanted gratification from inflicting pain..... oh man, this is the way.

And when you are banned, it is not uncommon for your appeal to be rejected.

But that is not all. 

When you are banned, Hinge lets you create a new account. A shadowbanned voyeur account; you can look, but you can't touch. Your new Hinge account will be shown an endless line of hotties, as if you were a hottie yourself. But you will be invisible. You can click the Like button, but recipients will never know.

Speaking of hotties, Hinge keeps this endless line of hotties at the front of the line, so that when you run out of your 5 Likes per day, your impatience might get you to part ways with your hard earned cash.

So for context and just my life story please go read my previous post from a few days ago and like because it's too long, you can start at the part where it says ""So here is my issue"". Just do it. I'll appreciate it for life.

And then continue here :))

So here is what happened ... he dm'd me. I responded, we exchanged 3-4 messages then he asked me out for drinks. I took like a day and a half to respond to him (because like my cultural thoughts and potential comments/judgments from my parents got in my head). So anyways, as I was saying, he asked me out for drinks and I took too long to open his message but I ended up responding by saying this ""yeah we can do that"". And he hearted it. Not just the double tap red heart, he went and looked up the pink heart with the starsss loll. Okay, that was 2 weeks ago. We haven't gone out for drinks yet. Like a part of me is thinking that the ball is in my court and I should message him... but then... I asked others what they think... 

My BFF disagrees with me. She thinks the ball is in his court since he asked me out and then didn't follow through. 

But then... I told the whole thing to my therapist. Keep in my mind though, she is my age but has a master's degree and is licensed and is also from a similar background/culture so gets all my complexities and so she told me, well you pursued this guy HARD then took too long to open his message asking you out and then responded very dry.... 

What do I do?? I can't stop thinking about him. Like I want him so baddd. AGAIN, for context, you have to read my previous post. This guy is soo my type and after adding him on ig, I see that we are definitely into the same things (art, fashion, creativity) and this is not very 'like-me' to be going after guys like this. I tend to honestly just stick to online dating or occasionally meeting a guy through family and/or family friends and find them (for lack of a better word) kind of boring but they are usually the type of guys that my mom and dad would approve of but I just feel meh about. But idk with this guy, I feel different, like obviously idk for sure what's going to happen because idk him on a personal level yet but so far - from what I see - I'm interested. More interested than I've been in any of the other guys I've met online or through family and friends. 

So umm for TLDR lol.... should I just dm him? and per title, I am 2.5 glasses of Chianti deep :)  

And what I was thinking of sending was like very forward like ""ok so when are you taking me out"".

79,ojax90,1626162881,"Not attracted to a girl, should i break it off?","Hi guys and gals and everyone between!

I've been on two dates with this girl that my buddie set me up with a blind date with.

Got to give to my friends credit that her personality is so much like mine, we're both huge introverts and we also have so much in common, like hobbies and interests and that stuff.

But she isin't my type physically, and i'm not totally attracted to her. I got this feeling already on the first date, but thought that maybe attraction isin't that important bc we are some much alike. Or that the attraction comes later.
But now after date #2, i still feel the same about it, and only stronger. 

I find myself going on her facebook to look at her profile pictures and trying to get attracted to her, but no use it seems.

I feel like a picky douche and i hate it haha.

Also if i would break it off, would it be bad to do it via a phone call since we live somewhat far from each other and she has a car and i don't, so i don't want to make her drive here for that. By bus, which i travel with mostly, takes about 2 hours there and back. So even that is not a  big issue, so if you guys think a phone call is bad, i'll just have to go to her.

What would you do? And have any of you had this sort of experience yourselves?

Thanks! Peace and love!


Edit:

The ""not my type"" situation is that she is a bit ""bigger"" than that i usually go for. How would you bring it up and not hurt her feelings?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ojax90/not_attracted_to_a_girl_should_i_break_it_off/

81,ojb1jr,1626163445,How can I finally get over the hump and start having some success with online dating?,"I‚Äôve been trying to study the tinder/bumble/hinge game for a while now. I completely understand that online dating is not for everyone and you have to be someone who follows rules 1 and 2. But I believe that I have at least the potential to succeed on OLD but I need some advice on how to capitalize.

I‚Äôve probably been on more dates from OLD than I can even recall but none of them have ever transitioned into a relationship, a fwb, or even a hookup. From sources and stuff I‚Äôve seen online from tinder experts, they explain how women have 100s of options on dating apps so you don‚Äôt really have many chances to wow her before she ghosts you for the next guy. Which probably explains why I often get ghosted after 1-2 dates. Originally my approach has been to take things slow, going on normal ‚Äúdates‚Äù and taking things slow. 

I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of stories of people even hooking up on the first date and I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm going wrong? But I‚Äôm unsure on how to make that happen. Obviously I could invite a girl over for wine or to watch something but that just seems too soon for a first date and I have a hard time believing a girl will be comfortable with that.  Does it make more sense to go to a nearby bar and then just try to bring her back after? Normally I would‚Äôve thought girls prefer to take things a bit slower but I figured that I needed to change my approach bc obviously it wasn‚Äôt working.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ojb1jr/how_can_i_finally_get_over_the_hump_and_start/

91,ojbjvd,1626166095,How to save long distance relationship? Is it even possible anymore?,"my girlfriend and i have been together since we were 16/17 for over 2 years now. we are now both studying in different cities both in our second semester.

the first semester was easy on us, because of covid and no in person lectures, and so we could meet (we were still allowed to, don't worry) much more often and also just spent more time in everyday life together that way.

but now things don't look as good anymore. this second semester she spent way more time in her city and there were a few weeks where we both had a lot to do and didn't interact as much online as usual.  she has another guy there, which she befriended pretty early on in her studies. they spent a lot of time together and now it looks like it could become more than just friends and i could just be replaced.

i really want her to have friends there and not only have me to spend time with, but that just really hurts and i have the feeling that i should have done something earlier on to prevent that. then again i cannot be too possesive. after all she is an independent human being and i don't own her.

when we were seperated longer than usual the first time and also haven't had as much online interaction as before, i of course had some bad thoughts and feared that something is up, but i told myself that everything is gonna be fine and just trusted that she still loves me and wouldn't replace me so easily.

now she has to decide with whom she wants to go on with. either the guy living 5 mins away from her, who from what i can tell is similar enough to me that it apparently does not make that much difference, or me who lives 100km away from her, with who she has 2 years of history and memories with.

we have about two weeks of exams now so there will be a bit of time for both of us to think about things, but there has to be a descision at some point. we cannot go on like this with her liking me more again after spending some time together but then being seperated again and it slowly going away again.

i know that descision is also not easy for her, bc she ofc knows how much history we have and that many beautiful things would just be ruined were we to break up. the last few days i have been thinking about if i should just end it to make her descision a bit easier and ""just"" make me the one drinking the koolaid more or less. but even just thinking about that is so heart and gut wrenching.

there is so much connected to our relationship that i really don't want to give up, but i really don't know if there is a better choice (for me at least) right now. the thought of her giving the amazing love that i received for so long from her to someone other than me and potentially even having sex with someone else is just so terrifying to me. i also cannot imagine ever opening up to someone else to the point that i did with her. and i know relationships aren't just about sex, but i really cannot imagine having it with someone else in the world but her. that is not just because i am an introvert, but because she is that special with me.

i have also been thinking and we talked about it a bit, if we should take a break, but at the time it didn't look like that was even in the realm of possibility, because if we were to do that she should also not have contact with the other guy, she needs him to help her with her exams and studies (and i can't just deny that for her). right now it looks to me like it could technically be possible during the summer break, but even if it is possible, is that even a good idea?

now at the end i'm just going to lay out what *i* think went wrong:

i think it was really nice for her to have someone similar to me, to spend time with while im a long distance away from her. the problem i think is that she should have talked to me earlier if she thought something could go wrong or that she fears that our relationship could be at stake, and not wait a week or longer to tell me what really is up, just so it can be done in person. i know talking irl is way better than texting or on the phone, but if there is something wrong i really would have liked a heads up a bit earlier.

also i know that everything is easier in theory than in the real world and i don't want to say she is completely at fault here, but i cannot imagine how it can even happen that you develop feelings for someone else like that. maybe it's also just my introverted self, but if i had a girl in my city who is similar to her or that i just feel a bit attracted to, i feel i (at least hopefully) would stop and constantly try to remind myself that i am happy with my girlfriend and don't need someone else or just reevaluate if i am happy and talk to her if i feel something might go wrong. after all the love she had for me i also don't understand how there could be a ""the grass is always greener"" situation now all of a sudden.

now after all of that is there even the *slightest* chance that this could be fixed somehow??

by now i get the feeling that her feelings are way too far developed or at least way too scrambled that our relationship could survive. i just really really don't want what we have or have had till now to go under, just because we weren't able to study in the same city. i know things change and i need to get used to not being the only person in her life, but i just cannot imagine us breaking up, especially not like this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ojbjvd/how_to_save_long_distance_relationship_is_it_even/
