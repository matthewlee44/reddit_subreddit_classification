We have been dating for about a month.

I am well-educated and am able to support myself, but I don't have the means to support her. I am a low-value man according to the sub, and now I'm worried that she deserves better.

Unfortunately, I chose a career as a mental health therapist working with low-income individuals with severe mental illness, and it doesn't pay much.

I stumbled across the Female Dating Strategies sub-reddit, and unfortunately, I'd be classified as a low-value male due to my inability to provide for her and the fact that she makes significantly more than I do. We are also equitable with expenditures, and I have never truly pampered her or taken care of her financially. We are about even on who pays for food, etc., and I haven't planned any extravagant dates for her.

I feel that I must be a low-value male also because while I cook for her and say/do nice things for her, I am not truly courting her, and we were intimate early on. A low-value man does this. A high-value man waits for intimacy.

I'm not sure what I can do because I can't just magically make more money, and I can't really take risks (stock market, etc.) because I need the money I have for myself and my daughter (I'm also divorced with a kid which makes me more of a low-value man).

Hi everyone,

I am friend with a girl since some times and late this night she asked me out of the blue if I was aware that everyone in and out of our circle think we are in a couple.

It is weird to me that she asked me that out of nowhere as we regularly joke about that fact. 
Recently, she got in a relationship with a guy but as she would tell me, I didn’t know it until I asked her current boyfriend if they were, and when I asked her, her answer was not nearly as enthusiastic as she is everyday. What I find weird is that she came to my place a couple of days before I knew it ( she asked me if we could spend the afternoon together and spent time coming from another city to mine ), and we were pretty close as we are every time we are together without anybody around.

I searched for signs if she could be interested but hiding it and she checked a lot of points, I am not fully onto her but I wouldn’t mind dating her as she is attractive and really kind, but I want to make sure it is not me being biased by the way I maybe would like to see signs.

If you have something bad to say to me please say it. If you want me to change my thinking please help me.

Ok so let’s say i am ready to get married but i am single. How do i get myself married? I have never “dated” in a stable mental condition. The only relationships i have had were very short and all in a psychotic state + delusional (erotomania, overall a mess that lasted maximum 2 months, hidden from family/sexually abused and hypersexual). Since getting medicated i haven’t had a relationship (and i am high functioning stable person on meds). I am traumatized by brown men/culture and i am a brown muslim woman. I am not traumatized because of all those men but traumatized because of the first one and what i did with the rest and the way it all happened (reminds me of bad sexual encounters, sexual abuse, and overall shame/guilt/traumas/psychosis).

I know this sounds very stupid, but i am a muslim and a brown woman but i want to marry a white guy (who would accept islam for me otherwise the wedding will not be religiously valid and i will not be comfortable with it if it is not accepted in the eyes of God). I know this sounds very racist and probably double-faced and sh\*t but listen to me fully please. I have been told that i am very very beautiful (i agree) and that ""guys will line up for me"", BUT my personality is sh\*t because i have no confidence and brown men reject me because English is not my first language and i have an accent so it is not acceptable to them. My mom says i am very kind hearted (i agree) BUT i don’t show it to guys because i never get to know them past simple ""hi"" ""hello"" ""how are you"" ""bye"". On top of all this, my English is sh\*t. I can't participate in group discussions in English; i think in English and speak like a 12 year old, but in group discussions it just goes over my head and i feel like i don't belong where there are native English speakers. There was this really cute white guy who showed interest in me once, but most of the stuff he spoke just went over my head and caused me a lot of anxiety because i had to be alert non-stop to understand him properly so i got rid of him and felt extremely sad but relieved.

People ask me why not black men or asian men. That’s because my “society” (brown sub-culture in canada) will not accept it and when i have kids with black or asian men my community will not accept them as ""brown."" I know someone who is mixed brown and black and she had to go through hell in a brown society growing up, and i also know people who are mixed brown and white and they are considered ""cute"" and there's no discrimination against them no bullying, in fact they are ""desired"" as potential daughter-in-law or son-in-law. (I hate this culture but i have this compulsion to be a part of it....this is why i want marriage and not just dating thing, i want commitment i don't want breakups, i don't care if he divorces me, i accept divorce over break-up, my thinking is weird i don't know how to change it).

Why white man? Because i have this belief that they are modern and more accepting of illness/past sexual history. I would want to share my stories with my husband and not feel judged. It's in my head that a white man will not judge me. I want to feel 100% comfortable with a man and i can only trust a white man (i know i might be wrong but that's just how my mind is thinking right now) + i think brown women and white men create really good looking babies.

Why are looks so important to me? I was considered an ugly duckling as a teenager (really dark, really bad/awkward hair style, baggy oversized clothes, hated shopping, had no makeup not even a proper moisturizer, so many weird/awkward things about my posture and the way i walked/talked etc, awkward short social media presence where i just embarrassed myself in front of the entire world in so many ways), after university i started improving little by little. First i joined gym, then deleted my social media but kept accounts to follow fashion and makeup, got into makeup and decent clothes, started using sunscreen and stopped going out in the sun and went from dark to light in 1 summer (literally 3 shades lighter in foundation), grew out hair or cut it very short (basically stylish and not awkward), overall i changed 90degrees (still not 180, i am looking to improve the way i express myself, the way i speak so that i can improve my social standing especially on social media and make more friends, be active and be extrovert (i am an introvert right now, deep down i'll always stay an introvert but i want to appear an extrovert, maybe i have too many insecurities? i do.))",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1152097,public,self,"Need some dating/life advice.

Bios that just say something completely uninformative like ""Hi"" or ""INJF"" or ""IDK what to write message me"" or a series of 3-4 emoji's that's somehow supposed to convey who you are. Bios that are super generic and don't make people stand out (yes, you love cats, wine, and the office. You and the last 10 people i've seen.) 

Aside from bios, I've seen pictures with blurred faces, pictures taken from like 30 feet away, profiles that exclusively have group photos, photo's taken in the worst possible lighting/angles imaginable, night time pictures, pictures where the person's face isn't even showing because they're looking away from the camera, and even a literal drawing instead of a profile picture.

Aside from bios and pictures, there are also a ton of people who are just flat out lying ""Oh, I'm not actually in city x, I'm in city Y, I just put city x on my profile because I wasn't having luck in my city y."" etc.

It feels like only 1 in 10 profiles seem to have totally accurate, detailed information on who you are and what you're looking for, and it's driving me crazy. I've never felt more isolated from people than since I started online dating, and passed over like 60 people in a row because there's just nothing there and I can only assume they're just looking for random hookups based on their profile picture or something.

I’m in this aisle where the mac and cheese boxes are and mid-grab of some Amy’s Shells and White Cheddar I notice that this woman, I assume fairly younger than I am, is looking straight at me with a tilted head. I feel heavily judged, “Oh shit… maybe I shouldn’t be getting four boxes of this” I was thinking as I just returned the stare.

Instead of a judgy question as expected, she actually asks me if I’m Hispanic in Spanish. Confused, I just said “Si…?”, me now thinking that maybe she just needs some help and she can’t speak English. No, what she starts talking about is family lineages, how I look European, possibly Dutch, how our skin complexion is exactly the same in how we sunburn easily, how she’s Mexican/Spanish and how her family is white-skin despite being Mexican because of marriage, and a bunch of other things that pretty much funneled down to what I felt was eugenics and genealogy. She’s speaking as if it’s a long rant with no entry point for myself to speak and I start getting suspicious, just responding with “ah” and “si” most of the time. She’s also speaking to me in Spanish but she speaks in such a way where she has a gringo-ish accent, so I suspected she knew English and tried speaking some English to her as well (tbh my Spanish isn’t all that strong). My suspicion ended up being correct because, in her long rant about marriage she actually couldn’t say matrimonio and just said “marriage.”

At this point I feel like a mark, like she’s working with someone to pick my wallet as she speaks to me, so I face my back against the shelving, because who talks about these things randomly to a stranger in the middle of a Walmart? I had the mind to ask her exactly this, ask her what compelled her to talk to a stranger holding four boxes of mac and cheese about Latino bloodlines and skin complexion. It didn’t come out that way, as when I started to speak I felt that it was fairly mean, so it ended up being “So how can you tell all this by just looking at someone?” She tells me that she can tell by facial features and whatnot, then an awkward silence permeated into the conversation so she says her goodbye and kind of power-walks away. About 30 minutes later as I start paying at the self-checkout, she walks into the lane directly in front of mine so now we’re again meeting face to face but I’m kind of doing my thing and don’t look at her as I pay.

The thing about this encounter that made me suspicious and fearful about her wasn’t even the topic at hand or that I may have been a mark. Conversations like that happen sometimes here in Miami (what nationality are you, etc.) and it’s a really normal question and conversation to have, just not to the extent that she took it and certainly not without context. Instead, she just reminded me a lot of my ex in the most negative ways. My ex was a mousey, soft spoken type but she was really emotionally abusive and knew how to get under my skin. Both were physically petite women with cute faces, socially awkward, and spoke in the same matter. I know realistically that this woman is not my ex, she could have been different, but there were too many similarities between them and I bailed on asking for her name and number.

I’ve since asked friends and family about their opinions over this encounter. Friends are pretty sure she’s weird and to avoid her simply because of the genealogy talk. My mom says I fucked up and to get with the program, that I should have asked for her number because supermarkets are good meetup places. My dad says the opposite, stay far far away from this girl because that’s creepy behavior. My cousin took the middle ground and thinks she was trying to flirt with me but was socially awkward and didn’t know how. At the time I thought that she might be some stalker especially after the self-checkout encounter but now I think my cousin is the more correct out of the bunch, and to be honest I don’t know if I’m feeling FOMO over a lost connection or for not having asked her why she’s talking about the things she spoke about to the extent that she took it to.

And outside of our common things she was really interesting as well. Oh, and she was really pretty and fit as fuck (we're both gym rats).


So, we had an amazing first date with reciprocated immediate sympathy. Then we had an amazing second date with a lot of physical contact and cuddling, blablabla, you know the drill... The third date went really great as well and we had sex. After the sex she seemed a bit more distant but we watched Netflix and cuddled for some more time until I had to go because it was getting late and she'd need to get up very early for work.


The next few days, I felt like something was off and I tried to give her space, so we barely texted. Well, just a few days ago I wanted to ask for another date, but she told me that she thinks that she's not ready for another relationship (on the 2nd date she mentioned that she had recently broken up from a LTR).


I was like: ""alright, I can understand why you feel like that, I'm not mad."" And it's true, I am not mad at her at all. I really like her as a person, and I actually believe her reasoning although ultimately it does not matter. I am mad because I live in a bumfuck 25k town in Austria with a shitty OLD scene and finding someone that matches myself that well is so fucking frustrating. And I don't have any social hobbies: I go to the gym alone and I do martial arts (very few women). Other than that, all my hobbies are inside at home.


This was the first dating experience for 9 years (I'm 29) because I didn't really want to put in the effort to date during that time as I was doing my engineering degree and focusing on my career. And I came to the conclusion that I hate dating. Well...time to move forward and activate my Tinder account again and let the roller coaster ride continue. And maybe I can find some other activities that I like that aren't a sausage-fest ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

We've been friends for around 4 months. We're on the same university course and we pretty much instantly connected and have been best friends since. 

Before Christmas I was starting to see her as more than a friend. We had assignment deadlines due and so we both studied together (just us). One of the days we'd spent almost 7 hours together, which was crazy. 

Around this same time though she was out drinking with her friends. She asked me to come meet her and to come out with her friends, which I did. Her friends are mostly her flatmates, who I've met before but I'm not entirely comfortable with them on my own (important). It's all good for a few hours but we get to the club and she gets with someone else. I felt as if she just left me to dry and we did have a conversation about it the day after. Both apologised and made up, but after this I thought it was pretty clear she only wanted to be friends. 

We both went home over Christmas so we didn't see each other for 3-4 weeks but we still talked almost daily.

She came back this week. We saw each other in uni but she was late so we didn't manage to talk. On Tuesday I went over to her flat (we live in the same building) to 'study' but we literally just talked for a few hours. I mention a party that night and she asks to come. I go over hers that night as she gets ready and then we walk to the party together. 

Afterwards we go home together and she asks me to come to hers to hangout. We're both drunk, obviously. Once we're there we talk for an hour and she says I can sleep in her bed *as friends* if I want (remember we literally live in the same building). I just reply something like 'yeah sounds good' but she then jumps next to me, wraps her arms and legs around me and says 'tell me you want to stay'. Obviously I did that but before anything can happen she falls asleep in my arms.

Sounds good but then in the morning (we talk again for a few hours) she talks about her ex, how she wants a relationship, and some of the guys she's talking to. My friends who I've asked mostly say it's a test to see how I react? but I don't see why she would have to do that?

TLDR at end to skip date story

Situation. 4th date. I wont go into too many details, but I didnt make a move and wished I had. I communicated to her that I knew things were moving a bit slow, but that I really have been enjoying spending time with her and made it obvious that I wanted to still see her. She said that she is fine with things moving slow. I honestly showed some insecurity and Im worried that is going to backfire on me.   


It was the first date where we didnt plan our next date in person. up till then it just felt natural to figure things out becuase we where having such a good time. She has crazy hours and doesnt always know what her week will look like. Last thing she said was that she would let me know when she has a better idea of when she will be free. She has some stuff going on this weekend, plus work and has a friend that is going through something so she said she wanted to be there for her.   


All of this seems genuine, but 24hrs went by from last thing I said. Basically I told her that I hope that she gets the sense that she is helping her friend by being there for her, because she admitted to me that she didnt know how to help. And I think listening and being present in the situation was already a lot of help even if you cant fix the issue.   


Becuase I think she was giving some signals for a kiss possibly and I didnt take it and that I said some things that showed insecurity (like admitting I didnt have a lot of experience dating) I am honestly nervous that she lost interest. And after the date I was a bit tipsy and texted her saying she looked great that night and that I really enjoyed spending time with her. the next day I sort of cringed at my text and some of things I had said.  But she seemed to react well to the text and I did say in the text that I was a bit tipsy lol  


TLDR:  


How can I decipher whether someone is blowing me off or if they really need to figure out their next week? If they say they will let me know should I wait maybe 4 days and ask or what? Or should I let them get back with me? It's basically a waiting game I guess right?

Every time I tried to open up and become more transparent, the girl never found interest. ""Oh, I just see you as a friend."" ""I love talking with you because you're so open."" etc etc.

This is just stuff that I learned from dating, from seeing my friends dating. And the odds always ended up more in my favor when I wasn't so transparent and open.

But I'm older now. I'm at an age where my heart just wants to be transparent. Fighting this back and forth isn't working for me anymore. I want to find a wife. I want to find my best friend. Someone I can tell everything to. Someone who won't just turn away because I open myself up.

I don't just want a ""hey you're hot"" and have a one night stand. After, I felt so empty. I always wanted more. But I was afraid. I was afraid to open up.

I love to sing. I love pouring out my emotions when I sing. One of my dreams is to sing for the woman that I love. Just me and her. I just want to express how much I love her in the best way I know how - singing.

Now I've finally established myself in a stable position and starting to try to connect with people more. Anyway since I have no dating experience I thought it will be easier to try and make friends first rather than dive into the deep end of relationships. I usually attend group meetups since everyone there has come to socialize, instead of cold approaching strangers. 

I've found it's much easier to talk to men - they are more open, show enthusiasm, can carry conversations. Women on the other hand are aloof, give one word answers or just stay quiet. 

Initially I thought I'm doing something to make them uncomfortable but I approach them the same way I do with the guys, keep a friendly distance, same conversation topics, share something funny to relax the situation but no success...

We went to university to the same city, but at that time we still had online classes, so we agreed to meetup when we had live classes again (neither of us live in the city when we dont have classes). 

We talked from april and to september weekly. She had this weird style of texting back where she would only reply once between 5-7days, but she would write me a whole essay(not just 1liners) and ask me a lot of questions about myself and she also mentioned multiple times about how excited she was to meet me when uni was live again. I mentioned it twice that I dont  particularly like her 5-7days texting, and she kept apologizing but it never got better. Uni classes were due to start live in October and since we lived 4hours apart from each other during the lockdown, we agreed to meet in October.

She once asked me when my birthday is and I told her its in September. I didnt really expect or want any gift from her for my birthday, but I did expect a happy birthday text  or call and something along those lines. But she forgot about my birthday completely(I just wanted a happy birthday wish from her) and it kinda made me bitter, so I told her ""our communiction styles are way too different, I think we should stop this"". She never gave me a reply after that. 

Now I still keep thinking about her every day and I kinda miss talking to her, since I connected with her on a level that I never did with anyone else before (apart from the lacking communaction).

About 2-3 months ago, my high school year students had a 15-year reunion.

Even though the reunion got people together physically, almost all of us kept in fairly close contact. We're all between 32-34, right now, so in the last 5 years, a lot of us got married. Many of the single ones still dating and so we got talking about dating and relationships (regarding the given context, hetero ones in particular.)

A few people were in open or polyamorous relationships in the fairly large group. When the ""mono"" people were asked about it, with the exception of a few, all the guys pretty much said that the idea of the woman they love fucking other men would make them nauseous. On the other hand, a few women said they'd wanna do poly, a few said they'd stick to only monogamy, while the majority said that open or poly relationships are not what they're looking for, but are somewhat ""open to"" but to different extents for different people. Most of the women felt that it wouldn't matter too much to them if the man they're with is sleeping with other people as long as no emotions are involved, but recognized that there are gonna be issues with sexual health and time-related logistical issues in general. They never quoted any sort of jealousy or whatever, while the vast majority of the men did.

I've been watching and reading work by Esther Perel and Wednesday Martin recently and both of them (the latter more strongly) concur that women find it harder with long-term monogamy, compared to men. Also, according to many surveys, women are twice as likely to ask for an open relationship. In my adult life, the numbers are even more skewed.

Now she was in a bad/toxic, 6 year , relationship. Long story short she left him and we started a life , got an apartment, we both got new jobs in our area. She is her age, no children but the man she was with, had children(2) she helped raise for six years! i understand you are going to have a tie to those children, you were their mother you know. That’s how i seen it from the beginning, like it was brought to my attention. she still wanted to keep in contact with her ex but he would msg her really inappropriate msgs and she would always shoot him down bc it made him less attractive when they weren’t together and she’s trying to talk to him for the childrens sake. 
That being said time has gone on since this, he pressed charges on her for breaking his apt window when his baby’s mother smashed her car window &amp; windshield. Very Toxic
We’ve had our ups and downs sure but every argument we have is insued by her. Like she will do all the dishes then complain about doing them. i tell her just ask me whenever they are needed to get done and i’m there no hesitation but she thinks she shouldn’t have to tell me. i able to agree but i do not go in the kitchen , i’m hardly home if i’m in the kitchen is to get her wine refilled or to throw stuff away.
this being said we have drifted apart the beginning of December all month until 3 days ago. however way before those 3 days i’ve made plans to move because she made it clear to me she was single and it got to the point where i felt uncomfortable in this house we were supposed to make a home. i packed all my items, transferred my job , plane ticket &amp; have a roof over my head. however 3 days ago we took a shot and she said to new beginnings and i didn’t understand why but i think it’s because she is realizing i’m serious about not feeling comfortable. but when we get in arguments she is so quick to tell me then leave if you don’t feel comfortable. i feel like if you wanted a new start to things you would at least try to comfort me but will ignore me and sit on the phone with a friends after just complaining i’m never home to spend time with her “god forbid you have to spend time with me “ but that’s what i wa saying that whole time we were drifting apart because she would stay out till 4 am and not text but i leave for 3 hours and it’s hell. 
the pint is i have already committed to leaving and starting new somewhere else but i haven’t spoken a word about this to here and not sure how or if i should. i will always have love for her but she has put me in really bad mental states and i should never have to have felt that way. i also do feel taken advantage of, she has never had an apt or house or anything like that in her name. this is the first time she lease and that was with me co-signing. like that was mine too and i’m 10 years younger like. i feel like i was way more mentally stable and and a mature at the end of the day! i had some complications with my hours at work so rent became a problem but never more then a moths behind.

I got very drunk and drunk texted a lot of women that I had crushes on. I met them at past meetups but haven’t seen them for a while so I drunkenly asked them out.

I usually said something like “Hey Name, how’ve you been? I’ll be honest I was pretty nervous last time but I’d love to get coffee with you. Are you down to grab coffee around Day at time at location on street”?

Some other women, I texted them saying “Hey! I really enjoyed talking to you  at the past meetup and would love to get to know you more! Are you free at time on day? I'm going to go grab some coffee at location on street. So if you're free come along!”

Most of the women haven’t responded, but one of them said that she’s busy for the next 2 weeks with getting all graduate applications by the deadline”. Is that a sign of no interest?

Hell, I even drunk messaged my HR Business Rep and had a friendly conversation with her and she later mentioned her boyfriend who’s in the military ( I did NOT ask her out, she just told me)

Here’s where the concern is. 
He doesn’t want me to help him with anything. He is extremely hell bent on being independent. He won’t let me cook for him or clean for him. He is going through some health stuff and it’s causing him to withdraw from me emotionally. He won’t really let me help with that either. 
I’ve talked to him about it and asked him what could I do for him he says nothing. It’s not my responsibility. 
I don’t know what else I can do. I’m feeling like I can’t help him and this is now a burden on the relationship. This is both of our first serious relationship since divorce so we are both just learning about what works together. I don’t want to go anywhere but I’m starting to wonder if he will ever let me truly become part of his life.

People may hate what I’m gonna say,     but so be it. 

Let’s stop lying to ourselves. Like seriously. Sure, we can always do things to improve ourselves, but single people who are looking to date / find a relationship, try to improve themselves in order for the opposite gender / someone to like them romantically. 

I can see why any person would feel frustrated when they try so hard to improve themselves and yet no one notices them in a romantic manner. 

A lot of the things I’ve read almost comes across as toxic positivity. Truth be told once and for all, ONLINE // DATING SUCKS. Unless you’re having easy game getting matches and going on dates. A huge proportion of people (I really do not need to cite a percentage) struggle with online dating. 

Dating apps don’t give a fuck about you. In fact most of these apps DO NOT want you to find someone. They are there for your money. I used to think apps like Coffee Meets Bagel, Hinge and Bumble care about their users, but THEY DONT. They’re just like Tinder and OkCupid, they want your money, THATS IT. 

Being upset that you worked so hard to achieve a body that you want, yet somehow still struggle with dating, is a completely valid reason to get upset.

You don’t need to be someone learning science to realise that the reason why most of us humans care so much about our body, is simply because of biology. When we ourselves look unattractive, that lowers the chances of finding a partner **physically** attracted to you. 

You could achieve a body you like, but the end goal is for someone to like you because of physical attraction. The whole point of view about how physical looks don’t matter as much is complete bullshit. 

People who don’t take care of their physical bodies and get significant others, are rare. Its case by case. 
One other reason it’s because they’re already in scenarios that landed them to be able to find someone interested in them. [eg: being friends with that person for a certain period of time, and both parties don’t mind dating each other] 

Try being ‘a fat, ugly person’ on OkCupid, and you’ll be struggling to even get a match on the app, let alone a date.

I don’t wanna go into details but basically a guy (who I have known for years through mutual friends) that was super interested in me and told me I was the only one for him after just a couple of weeks, who showered me with affection, love, and gifts just broke things off yesterday. I will add that I met up with him on holiday break in my hometown where he lives, and before I left he told me he would love to do long-distance when I return to my city, which I did this past weekend. Then yesterday, he texted me saying he didn’t know what he wanted and he isn’t sure about exclusivity or a relationship at this time. That he wasn’t thinking things through when he told me he wanted something serious and doesn’t even know if things would be different if we were in the same town. OUCH. But also- wth?

I’m very blindsided but I guess I should’ve seen it coming, like a firework just destined to fizzle out, or a tidal wave that’s about to crash. I just keep thinking of how things were a couple weeks ago when he made me feel like the most special girl in the world. Telling me he’s had a crush on me for years and how spectacular we would look together. And talking about the future and all the things we would do and the dates he had planned. Telling me how badly he wanted to see me and picking me up from my house and taking me to nice dinners. Spending hours just talking. He told me he thought we would make an amazing couple. That we should get tattoos together one day. And go on a trip to a faraway country when he gets his bonus this year.

I just feel so hurt and confused. I feel stupid as well. He has messaged me almost every single year wanting to date but I have always been in a relationship up until recently. I regret giving him a chance now because I feel so used. I thought nothing could possibly go wrong because he seemed so incredibly interested and made me feel special. I also thought nothing to go wrong because I met him through mutual friends. I fell for him so fast and didn’t see it coming.

He wants to continue talking but I don’t see the point in this, although I would like to continue messaging him because of how lonely I am. Just looking for some support and advice if you have been through something similar. I really thought that he was different because of how he talked about me and to me and treated me when we were in person and he made it seem like the distance was nothing… and then everything changed..

He is the only guy I have ever been with intimately. From the beginning he has always had a lot going on from still dealing with the death of his mom, his best friend overdosing, living with his grandfather in their big house that had no running water or working bathroom due to his grandfather being a hoarder, finding out his father wasn't his real dad, then his grandfather dying who was like his real father from covid in 2020. 

He ended up staying with his aunt after his grandfather died who was so cruel to him. He’s living in his car now ( sometimes he sleeps at his cousin house) he lost his job recently because he kept calling out n doing Lyft instead. He has been thru so much I know he is tired mentally n emotionally. I have always been there for him to the point if taking on his problems. Giving him money. Most of our relationship I always had a car n even drove my car. I feel like most of our relationship I have supported him more emotionally and physically. When he is in a good mood he will even admit it. 

Last year was tough for me it's the first time I have really needed him n he hasn't been there in the smallest ways.  But he's living in his car so I gave him a break. But recently my mom n I got covid. He knows how scared I have been because I have bad asthma. He didn't even respond to my text messages when I told him. For days he didn't even check on me ( I did block him after he didn't answer my calls or text for 24 hours when I told him) I ended up texting him a week later to buy some edibles for me and I paid him to leave it at my door. He responded to that message fast n never reached out to me afterward.

I feel hurt n I'm wondering if he has been using me. I know things are tough for him right now but I have been his rock for yrs even when I had my own problems. I pay him had money to do things for me n I'm.not even working but I know his situation is worse. Over the years I have done so.much for him n never charged a dime. 

I understand that some ppl just aren't able to be there for u like u are for them.
