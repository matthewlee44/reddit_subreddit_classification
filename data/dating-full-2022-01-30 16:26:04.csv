So I've been on two dates with this guy (38M) and from the beginning it was hard for me to tell if he actually wanted to date me or if he was just looking for a fwb. I actually didn't care either way since I'm still in a weird place since my last breakup. So when things started to get heated last night I was like...sure why the fuck not.

We were in my bed watching movies and smoking pot. He kept reaching over and rubbing my boobs in the most unsexy way. I was trying to get into it but it literally felt like he was kneading a pair of tits for the first time. Then he started fingering me which was less than exciting. He then proceeded to practically shove his dick in my face expecting me to suck it. Guys, if a girl wants to suck your dick she will. No need to baseball bat her in the face with your dong to make it happen.

Well then he put a condom on and proceeded to literally jackhammer my vagina for a whopping two minutes before he finished and rolled over to fall asleep. I'm just laying there disappointed.

So, I probably have my answer. I'd thing if a guy was actually interested he would put on his A game for the first performance. I don't even want to retain him as a fuck buddy because the sex was so bad. This wasn't even awkward first time sex, he literally did not know what he was doing and seemed like he just wanted to get off as quickly as possible. No thanks, I'll pass.

And to think I haven't had sex in four months (by choice) I ended my streak with extremely disappointing sex.

1. He cant text during the week.  He says he is up for a promotion so upfront he told me he was terrible at texting.

2. He pushes for early weekend dates.  Was worried about how late we were last date even though he didnt check the time the whole date.  

3. Has No time to plan dates.  i kind of resorted to making the plans

4.  Said he is living in a substituted apartment that his ex’s job got them— who moved away- got in because of her job… why is he still living there? I asked and he said he stayed when she left.  I guess that could be true.

5. Only on tinder— seems like a casual place since this guy says he is looking for a relationship.

Recently I became sexually active and I found that during doggy style sex, in the specific spot [around 1 inch up and to the left of the place where penis connects to the body](https://i.imgur.com/kfyTwB8.png) (from my perspective) every single time I start to feel pain that begins as just slight discomfort every time my partner's bottom hits my genital area but then gets progressively more unpleasant until after merely a minute or two it's painful enough to steal my attention completely and feel as if I kept pressing on a bruise in that spot.

I never felt this cause any problems in my life beforehand. I don't experience this discomfort in other sex positions either. Even when I want to deliberately cause it now, I need to press pretty hard on that specific spot so it seems weird to me that a mere clap of my partner's bottom after every thrust would be enough to trigger it, let alone make it painful enough for me to stop enjoying the position. 

Is it because of some muscle there? I'm an avid runner and run aroung 40km a week while being rather heavy (90kgs/180cm) so maybe this can be putting some strain on that spot?

I(22F) met this guy (25M) at a party through mutual acquaintances back in early november. i followed him on instagram, and he asked me out 2 days later. he took me to dinner+bar and we ended up at his place. I met him 5 days later bc he was going to tattoo me (for free lol) but he asked me if i wanted to hang out first and we went to an exhibition. 
i was not looking for anything serious so for someone to take me out i was feeling a bit confused since usually i don’t do this with ppl i hookup with. 
a week later he invited me to an event in a bar where he introduced me to many of his friends and it made me even more confused since i thought it would just be us 2 going for a drink and going back to his place, however we hanged out with his friends until 5am :’ and when another guy tried to talk to me he sat in between us. 
whenever i asked him what he was looking for he always turned the question around so that i’d have to answer first —  i told him i was not looking for something serious but was not against a fwb relationship but i preferred to keep things private as i feel awkward meeting his friends. 
we don’t text each other (except when we want to meet) and often leave each other on delivered. he gives me a lot of mixed signals and at the beginning i must admit i got a bit attached. 

why would a guy introduce a random girl he hooked up with to his friends? and why wouldn’t he tell me what he’s looking for?

So  me and my ex-gf were together for  almost 7 months. We broke up because  I felt kind of insecure and because  she spends 16h a day working so  thinks were kind of not happening the  best way it could be between us.

We   broke up last November and she said that she expects to suddenly feel   the urge to kiss and hug me and so on and that she expects change both   in me and herself. I started going to therapy and I believe there's a   positive change in myself.

Beginning   of January, she caught COVID so for the entire quarantine (2 weeks) we   spoke pretty much 24/7 even when we were asleep, we were still on a   call. She said I'm the reason why her quarantine went so well and that   she has never relied on someone else as much as she relied to me. While   in quarantine, she asked me a few times to show myself on video so she   could feel happy.

Last saturday,   her quarantine ended. We went out but I realized I dont exactly feel  the  same excitement towards here. Despite of that, she asked me to  spend  the night over at her place (nothing happened) and the next day  asked me  to go out with her and a few friends of her. While we were  out, my ex  mentioned she wants to celebrate her upcoming birthday in a  non-standard  way and one of her friends said that she should be careful  because she  did something similar and it costed her an 8 year long  relationship. My  ex said it doesnt really matter because she is not in a  relationship so I  kind of realized that maybe we won't end up  together.

Today,  she finally got  my things back and she eventually asked why I behave  like I'm mad at  her. I said I'm keeping my distance and that my feelings  are slowly  fading away and that I can't keep waiting for her. I could  see in her  expression that she felt sad and told me that she THINKS we  should be  together but doesn't really feel the ""wow effect"" anymore. I  eventually  decided to kiss her to see how both of us are going to feel  and I  could say that I still have feelings for her. She kissed me back,   however, but after that she said ""how is this going to help us?"" She   asked how I felt after the kiss and told her I believe we could make it   work, however she said she still feels something, she THINKS we can  make  it work, but doesn't believe she is going to FEEL the same way.  Also  she said that we waited too much for this talk and that we  eventually   had to define it. I tried to bring this topic a few times,  but she  didn't want to think about it or discuss it so I don't blame  myself on  that.

Well, yeah, I  believe thats a  firm 'no', but then why she would ask ME how I feel and  tell me she  THINKS it could work out but doesn't FEEL so? I'm really  confused how  you can spent so much time with someone and still not feel  like you  could make it work... It feels like she wasn't entirely sure  but then  again, why would you say a firm 'no' if you doubt it...",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1155876,public,self,What is going on?

After just over a week of talking, he asked for my number and a few days after we met up for drinks in the city. He paid for most of the rounds, but I offered and managed to pay for the last one. Since then, we’ve been seeing each other approx. twice a week. It’s been around 3 months now. I’ve met some of his friends, he’s met some of mine, we’ve been on two double dates, as well as lots of 1-1 dates. He always holds my hand around his and my friends. Over Christmas we both went back to our family homes, but we messaged everyday (albeit not much throughout the days). He said he mentioned me to his family over Christmas. We have a lot of fun together, but also talk about deep topics and he has confined in me about the personal stuff he has had going on recently. 

Here’s where it gets confusing for me. After a month, I told him I liked him and that I’m only interested in getting to know him. He said he felt the same, and we haven’t spoke about it again until earlier this week. The other day, I messaged him saying that I like him and am interested in only him, but that I’m confused as to what this is. He said that he likes me and has only been seeing me, and that he considers us to be seeing each other, and asked what I want out of this. To which I said that I can see this going somewhere / would like it to. He said that he’d like to think it’s going somewhere but that he’s not there yet. I was a bit disappointed by his response and wanted to clarify whether he means that 1) provided things continue to go well, he would be keen to take the next step when he feels ready, or 2) whether he’s yet to decide whether he would ever want to take the next step. He said it’s “definitely the former”  and that he “likes where things are atm”. He arranged to see me a few days later and it was really good but we didn’t bring up this convo. 

Here’s my dilemma: I really like him and don’t mind taking things slow (it took me 6 months to get into my last two relationships), but I feel like I put in more effort to arrange things and I worry that a few more months will go by and nothing will have changed. 

Truthfully I just feel a bit down bc it has made me feel like I’m not good enough.

So around the 16th of December I was at a family friends house I was 22 I just turned 23 I January and there is a girl who is 18, I pulled up to the house to take my family friend to the chemist and he has known this girl for years she calls him dad because they are close and because of her family situation.

So as I was driving he shows me a text from his partners phone and this girl was asking to get my number so I said yeah we talked on facebook and then met in person on like the 23rd of December here is where it gets tricky.

I got told by my family friend that she doesn't have a boyfriend that she said she isn't really with him and he is abusive so I thought ok as long as she isn't with him and I felt kind of bad because if he's abusive I felt like I could help her get out of that situation, so I meet her at my family friends house for the first time it's going well then her boyfriend shows up! So the next day I'm there she comes over (cutting out alot of the story) we talk I ask her what's the go with her having a boyfriend because I could be with her but not when she has a boyfriend. She says she has tried leaving before but it's hard so yeah she kisses me that night and the next day she pashes me (I didn't initiate) and then asked me if I wanted to lose my virginity the day after that on xmas eve, I said I would if she was my girlfriend but she isn't.

I'm not going to make out I'm perfect because honestly I was kind of gullible and thought in a way I could be her way out of a abusive relationship and I had never full on kissed a girl before, only on the lips but no pashed so I did pash her but I wasn't going to sleep with her. Then on Xmas day I was there again and she was too it was a good night but she was writing I love you on my arm and that a friend (girl) of mine told me that was childish when I told her, then an argument happened between a few of my family friends and she went home at like midnight and then ghosted me for.a week and that was out of the blue I didn't do anything wrong and also earlier that night her boyfriend hit her in the jaw when we weren't around and ran off. I was kinda pissed but anyway so yeah fast forward, just after new year after her ignoring me for a week I see her at the motorplex where my family friend works on weekends chilled with her out there till night time long story short she is with her boyfriend he tells me he respects me but that his girlfriend was just being a ho* and she tells me we can be best friends and that she's sorry for being a ho* their words not mine! Later that night he chokes her and throws her up against the car and takes off leaving her at the motorplex she is crying hugging me  I have to drop her off her house where her boyfriend is she tells.me she meant everything she said to me.and would be with me if she wasn't with him, now she just watches all my stories on fb but we haven't spoken since and she's with her boyfriend everyday.. 

The reason I'm asking for help is im fairy new to like a this ocd kept me back alot and still does I finally meet a girl who likes me and asks for my number but this is the situation my mind is stuck on her because I know if I see her in person again she'll be all loving on me because she likes me but it's probably not good for me any help would be amazing 

TL;DR girl asked for my number, kissed me, but she had a boyfriend who is abusive and told me she likes me but can't leave him, ghosted me then told me we are best friends",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1155883,public,self,Really need some help 🥴 (long story) but any advice would be appreciated ❤,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sgggd4/really_need_some_help_long_story_but_any_advice/,,,,,,

We currently live at the same apartment complex, just different apartments.  After some hesitancy he agreed.  I however want to buy a house and have been wanting to buy a house for some time and he would rather rent.  

I told him I would claim the mortgage and it would be my house and if he didn’t want to live with me then he could get an apartment but I told him I was tired of throwing money away in rent.  The houses I want to buy are based solely on my own income and what I can afford individually.  To him it’s not about living in the house that is the problem, it’s the commitment of me buying the house in the chance that he doesn’t like his job and wants to move.  In the last few months we had discussed possibly moving cities however he signed a job in our current one.  I would love to move however since we are still here I would like to start investing in a house.  My family and friends are here so if we stay I wouldn’t mind either.  I told him that in the neighborhood I want to buy, selling wouldn’t be an issue due to it being a very sought after neighborhood but he still insists we rent.  He told me that if I bought a house that we are essentially done.

He keeps looking for homes to rent where the rent is so expensive even if we split it I could literally pay for a mortgage on a house in my budget.

Should I just throw the thought of buying a house away for the time being and rent another year?  Or do I invest in my future and buy a house like I want at the risk of ending this relationship?  Am I being irrational?  My mom told me that I should invest in my future but right now it looks like those are conflicting interests.

Went on three very proper dates with a guy (I’m 35, he’s 40); I certainly wouldn’t say he was love bombing (I didn’t get any red flags ever), but very gentleman-ly, and was very traditionally courted- it felt really refreshing to be courted like that.  No pressure for anything, ever, no creepy comments, just a very kind man and took the lead in planning all our dates.  Third date was dinner at his house and we had sex- it was the first time I had first-time sex with someone and felt so comfortable and not self-conscious, and it was something I wanted to do (before anyone assumes he pressured me).  Afterwards, he really got to me, because he became very open and told me how I could set the pace of this relationship, how he always wanted me to be open and always feel comfortable communicating to him about anything.  I thought wow, this guy is great. There was nothing that made me feel his words were not genuine, and even now, my gut tells me that he was being kind and honest, but maybe a little ahead of himself.

Well fast forward a few days after that night, and crickets.  I finally texted him four days later and he said he wanted to see me again, that he had been busy; but he still never set plans…very unkind him.  I didn’t want to keep bugging him but my instinct told me he was not interested anymore.  Low and behold, the day before we were supposed to meet, he sent me a very long text message saying how he loved getting to know me, how great he thinks I am, but how he has been dating other people too (but only had sex with me), and found someone else most compatible and how he wants to pursue a relationship with her.  I was completely dumbfounded, even though I was expecting a “we’re not compatible” message.  He wrote that he was sorry if he hurt me, and that if I wanted to talk to him in person I could (the day we were supposed to meet, haha so convenient). 

I’m hurt, but I’m also kind of confused about how to read what he said.  When I first read it, I was shocked, but thought it was kind he was being very honest; when I read it again, though, I thought, wait, is he maybe actually trying to hurt me more?  Why even share that there was someone else he wanted?  If you’re being that honest, why wait all week and the day before we were supposed to hang out to tell me he can’t see me, when clearly he felt this way at the beginning of the week (he basically stopped texting).  Was him sharing that there was someone else sort of like a backhanded way to hurt me more, in the name of being honest?  Also, maybe it’s just me, but I find it slightly hard to believe he would dump me and all of a sudden dive head first to another relationship, and supposedly hasn’t slept with her yet (esp for a guy).

I've noticed that with drinks there's a slightly more romantic setting and I tend to get somewhar further with the girl I'm with. 
And this is usually one drink before making out/sex. I don't like drinking.


Coffee dates (mostly cause of the pandemic) I've found to be 100% failure rate. It's difficult to escalate intention.
But honestly I prefer this as I don't really like kissing or escalating on first dates. I just like to take it easy, get to know each other.
I wonder if this is because there's none of the romantic setting so it creates a friends atmos, or that they are just not sexually attracted to me.

In this scenario women text me and say they feel more of a friendship vibe.

This is the oxymoron as I see a lot of women saying they want to date someone who feels like their best friends on these dating profiles so when they come back with ""I enjoyed our chats but I got  friendship vibes"" thing I'm just amused cause I expected it.
Maybe there's some truth to not listening to female dating advice.

I'll try to explain it as best and short as possible. I know there is no answer to what i experienced but i hope i reach people who maybe experienced something similar and how they have dealt with it

# The Story

I met a girl on reddit trough an art subreddit, messaged her and we exchanged discord. We have been texting a bit about the subreddit topic and we quickly picked up a similar vibe between us. Since then we texted daily about our lives, hobbies and exchanged some pictures of us, played games together and generally had a good time.

As the texting progressed we started to catch feelings for each other, compliments started to end with heart emojis - the usual stuff. She said she always smiles when i text her something or send a pic, and vice verca. I started to catch feelings and i believe so did she. We share some distance between where we live and i suggested that we could meet up in the near future and she was very positive and happy that i asked about it.

As of today i was texting her during the day while i was studying and she replied as usual, sweet and flirty while she was playing games with her friends when suddenly my messages didn't reach her on discord cause she blocked me. I tried to text her on snapchat if something is wrong but blocked there aswell. In fact on every platform we shared. She didn't say anything, didn't leave a reason.

Now i'm really down and confused why she did it. It kinda hurts not knowing why. In my head i believe it was not voluntarily and she got forced to do it by someone i didn't know. I'm sure she wasn't in a relationship but you never know. It doesn't feel right that she went from ""Love you talk to you later"" to a silent block all by herself...

I still have her phone number to which i could send an SMS but i don't wanna invade her after trying 2 times already. 

# Conclusion

As i said earlier i'm not looking for an answer but maybe look for people who had something similar happen to them. Did you eventually find out why? How did you cope with it?

It might sound weird that i got attached so quick after only 1-2 weeks but i had a genuine experience with her so it hurts more than i'd like to admit...",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1155893,public,self,Randomly blocked after texting for a while?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sgi10d/randomly_blocked_after_texting_for_a_while/,no_ads,0.0,,,,

I totally agree, but I think I may have a satisfying answer.

Apologies if someone has already posted this.

Following some events from yesterday, I re-learned a lesson. Some people don’t take rejection well!!!!!

I’ve never had an issues with just sending that closure message of “hey sorry I’m not feeling it let’s leave it here, all the best.” But yesterday, when explaining to an OLD match that my feeling was to move on, he started attacking my character and saying quite hurtful things. Even though I didn’t know this person, and only talked to them for half a day, it hurt me and made me feel crappy.

Then I imagined how it must feel to have experienced that maybe twice in a row…three times….every time you reject someone, what if they reacted this way?! What would you learn?? You would develop a mindset that it’s easier just to ghost.

So I’ve drawn the conclusion that I’d someone ghosts you, they have learnt to be very conflict-avoidant and do not possess the tools to handle conflict well. This means that you have dodged a bullet early on, because all healthy relationships need conflict, and the person who ghosted you will struggle immensely with the growth that comes from confrontation &amp; conflict.

2) She is able to stay with my while I am in the other state (note. she said, if she is not able to make it work financially with her savings or her having a job, that puck falls on me)

I put my foot down and said, I am not going to take a financial repsonibility like that especially when the easy route of a Long distance relationship for 2 years exists. So i broke it off.

I told her, its great she is fine, and I am ok with our relationship, but I am not going to get married soon now because we are clearly on edge and we have had arguments like this in the past and a marriage at this volatile point is not wise.

We've been together for a year and half. Lately I've been losing feelings for him, due to the fact that ever since we started dating I barely ever see him get a job, we're
both in college, I work part time and take classes full time. Because of Covid he hasn't been in school since 2020, he also doesn't get a job, or if he did he'd work for 1 month or 2 and then quit. 

I used to blame this on the pandemic but I can't take it anymore. I may sound ignorant but I feel like I'm doing everything better than he is and he's dragging me down. My grades are better, I put efforts in looking for jobs, I've just finished an internship, I'm graduating in a few months and I already got a job
secured. My boyfriend in the other hand is still spending his mom's money. He's a guitarist and is in a band, he spends most of his days playing guitar and hanging out with his guys. Everytime I tried to convince him to get a job while he's not in school he'd say ""I'm busy with band practice and working
doesn't fulfill me, playing guitar does and that's what matters to me the most"". he sometimes thinks I'm too materialistic but I've never asked for gifts and fancy things. 

We did talk about getting married
in the near future but I just don't see his effort. Again he's a very good guy when it comes to treating me and is faithful. Ever since I noticed this I've been trying to lie to myself that once the pandemic is over he will get his life together and thing's gonna be fine, but it's been almost 2 years, while I've been trying so hard to work on self-

so much better than me, I should probably put some efforts in developing myself"", he thinks it is OK and literally says to me ""I think it's fine that (once we get married) we live with what we have (in term of $$),
what's important is that we love each other"". Like he literally says this so many times and I'm fed up, it is nice to have a soft and affectionate boyfriend but this is just not... realistic. Also, he doesn't know how
to cook or clean so I can't really buy myself another excuse such as girl bossing where I'd be the provider and he'd be the home maker. What do I do?

She has ""couple like"" pictures with him from this past fall on her social media, he does a lot of errands for her (i.e., walk her dog sometimes and fix things in her apartment), tags him occasionally in her social media posts thanking him for a recipe, went skiing together one times a couple of weeks back, and seemed to hide him from me until I brought him up a couple of days ago. There was also a time where she called off plans (i.e., ""I'm really tired after work let's raincheck today"") and later unintentionally implied that she hung out with him instead (i.e., ""My one friend came over really late on Wednesday and he...."").

When I finally asked her who he was she described him as a ""wonderful person who cares about her a lot and she would probably date but just can't at this time."" She also told me that they were casually dating in the past. I was honest that based off the fact that they have prior history it does make me uncomfortable if she is seeing/talking to him so much which she said that she understood and would stop if it did.

Even if she does ""stop"" I just still feel kind of weird about everything; especially the fact that she bailed that one time and hung out with him instead.

I met this guy online who lovebombed me, convinced me he really liked me for more, disclosed he had herpes, I stupidly gave him a chance because I liked him, he gave me herpes and then bailed. This person was not who I thought he was.

I know I had my part in the situation, I should have been more careful. He was very persistent and convincing. This lovebombing thing has even been in the news, so I will do my part to spread the awareness of it.

Since I can’t reveal anyone’s name here, here are some warnings about this man in case anyone runs into him or anyone like him:

- He'll text you non-stop with gifs and lovey dovey emojis at first. He didn't dive straight into sexual talk immediately, but he will be very charming. He told me he deleted his dating apps after meeting me (this was a week in). I hadn't even thought about deleting mine, so I thought he really liked me. 

- He will talk about trips and places he wants to take you one day. Talked about showing me the big Rocket in Huntsville, Alabama. Also talked about going camping, we talked about what we wanted in the future. He mentioned he wanted to start a business SEVERAL times, but could never speak to any ideas. 

- He’s divorced with 2 sons (one is transgender) Said he couldn’t wait for me to meet them (very early in).

- He’ll talk non-stop about his transgender son and appear very supportive despite the fact he’s currently planning to evade paying child support. In the beginning I bought this side of him and actually found it attractive that he supported his son, but now I know he only uses it to get laid. The dude literally NEVER talked about his other son! He had actually planned for only his transgender son to come with him to Alabama (never even mentioned his other son), but his son decided not to. I am only telling you what he told me, but based on that, I’d say there might be something far worse going on. He mentioned something about his transgendered son running away once as well…

- He’s from Huntsville, AL which is where he lived before he moved to Middleton, Wisconsin. We met in Wisconsin and then he moved back.

- He moved back to Alabama recently and had told me he plans to travel the country doing small side jobs to  “Visit people he cares about” and conveniently “never received his child support notice”. In other words, he’s planning to evade child support by traveling to country and probably fucking anything in sight.

- He has a masters in Biochemistry (or at least that’s what he claims on his LinkedIn). He’s unemployed and I have never known him to even have a job. He fired from his last chemist job for some “bullshit”. Also, he kept talking about how he had projects, but he could never speak to them. I’m also in a field of science, which was part of the initial attraction, and I talked about my ideas and projects. At first I thought maybe he had something big and exciting that he couldn’t talk about. Lol oh my, that couldn’t be further from the truth. I learned eventually that this guy was a talker, and not the real deal. Not by a long shot.

- He has a smell… like motor oil? Also his breath smelt like he had a tooth rotting. He wasn’t that hygienic. He almost never showers, he only did maybe twice out of all the times I saw him. He showered at my place because I suggested he do so because he smelled horrible sometimes. I’m not sure if he was just like that, didn’t notice it or what, but either way, it was really bad.

- He drove a beat up whitish gray Toyota with a black door that he claimed he crashed at some point while driving back from Alabama? He was always fixing it when it would break down, that have been the only true skill I saw from him. Now I don’t know what he drives. He drove his mom’s vehicle last time I saw him and he said something about putting her in a nursing home. So I suspect he’s taking her car. Otherwise he mentioned a broken down suburban. He also said he is going to take a dog with. Not sure how he plans to take care of it with no money. I doubt he'll be able to live off assistance and unemployment while evading child support but then again we do live in ‘Murica.

-6’3”, gray/white/dark hair. Probably buzzed with a beard. Just turned 44 in November.  

- When we did talk about science he just repeated the same dribble about how we live in the matrix. He talked a lot about how everything is a simulation and nothing is real. I understand there have been theories, but he made it sound like his life’s work. He had very minimal substance to speak on the subject. It made me question his credentials, especially when he tried to talk about my field of science. He really sounded like he skated his way through college learning only the minimum and then promptly forgot it all. Which I think explains why he was fired.

- Loves the band “Here come the mummies.” 

- He claimed he loved Doctor Who, but who knows if that’s true. I’m a life long fan, so I’m sure he mirrored that to get me sucked in.

- Tries to be modest and says he has imposter syndrome. To be honest, I don’t think he realizes how much of an imposter he actually is. He doesn’t belong in the field of science, he seems to merely bullshit his way through things, I can’t imagine him being very credible. He even tried to tell me he found the cure for AIDS but his work was mysteriously was stolen from his desk. This 2 years ago… still waiting to hear about that cure.

All in all, this guy is a real piece of shit. He talked so much about us doing things together and how much he liked me. Then disclosed a herpes and bailed. I know this shit happens and herpes isn’t a death sentence but god fucking damn it this fucking hurts. It wasn’t fucking right and I am writing this out because I need to get it out.

Sorry for language or anyone just thinks I’m stupid. I know I’m stupid for letting this happen to me. I’m upset and have been dealing with the aftermath for months now. I tried therapy and dating other people, but it’s been hard. I now have to disclose herpes to everyone I want to be serious with which puts a whole new level of anxiety and difficulty into dating. I just don’t know where to go from here, but I'm writing this here to warn people and for my own healing.

A few weeks before Xmas I went to a mates party, his partner had a few of her friends there. I ended up talking to one of them for a few hours, it was a big night so didn’t remember too much of it. Woke up the next day seen we had added each other of FB, I messaged her a few days later but the vibe I got from that was that she didn’t seem that keen so I just left it. 

Fast forward to this weekend. They have just got married, there was about 15-20 of us that stayed at the beach house they rented for the weekend, this girl being one of them too. I didn’t really bother attempting to talk to her thinking she probably wasn’t that keen until later on in the night, few more drinks etc and one of the boys said she was.

Honestly my memory is pretty hazy but I do remember initially talking to her, then us dancing together, then hooking up with her down on the front lawn (which apparently everyone got a good view of ha). After that though I remember us talking and her going on about not wanting anything serious as she’s travelling in 5-6 months, and then me talking to a mate later on saying i didn’t think she was keen (but not really knowing why I’d say that)

I didn’t really get a chance to see her the next morning before having to shoot off. The boys said we were all over each other which I do remember in parts but I swear we had a convo at some point. 

I guess my question to you guys is how do I proceed from here? I actually think she’s a really cool chick and bloody stunning, but I don’t want to push something that isn’t there potentially if that makes sense. How would you go about messaging her?

I told myself I’d never be a hookup/strictly casual guy but that’s where I’m at, and I’m headed towards becoming jaded about the whole concept. 

I also have quite a high libido, I’d have sex several times a day if I could. The result is I drive myself into chatting with/hooking up with chicks only for it to pan out poorly/become unsatisfying/end up being a massive time waste/getting emotionally hurt and further closing off. 

What do I do? I’d switch off my libido if I could but it doesn’t seem possible. I feel doomed to becoming a sex zombie and never getting back to having a healthy emotional committed relationship again 😣",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1155920,public,self,My heart is a tattered mess and I’m becoming emotionally unavailable / jaded.

Each of those seven would express very early on how strongly they felt about the potential for a relationship. However, without fail, each of them did not want to go forward. One of them said they lacked time and did mention that she felt I was very attentive to her needs. For example, she mentioned she liked waffles for breakfast so I bought some for the next time she would sleep over. However, she seemed to think it was too much. One other said she was not ready to be dating again, in the end. Another said we were maybe not as affectionate. Most of them mentioned something like time or not being ready.

When they told me they would not pursue a relationship, I thanked them for their honesty and bid them farewell. I also invited them to let me know if there was anything I did or said that turned them off, to which they all responded no and that I was a great guy. 

But I can't help but think that after 7 people, there must be something I do wrong. But I'm never told what it is.

.

I had two long relationships before. One lasted for 3 years (my high school years) and the other was really more deep and meaningful, and lasted 4 and a half years. 

The last relationship was over on July of 2021 (it's been 6 months) and I haven't dated no one yet. No hook ups, nothing. 

And basically due to the long lasting relationship (4,5 years), I feel kind of a little rusty, and trying to relearn how to flirt and these kind of stuff, all over again. 

The help I need is regarding that, right now, I'm starting to like someone again. She's younger (20, and I'm 24), but way more swaggier than me. And also, way more confident with herself than me. Tbh, I don't have a low self-esteem, but I don't have a high one also. 

Still, I'm feeling really hard to get all these rustiness and how-to-flirt-inability aside and I feel that, for me to really to have a chance with her, my flirtness and swagness should be way higher. 

The only advantage that I really have is that beside the age (I feel she respects/admires me a little more due the age gap) is that I'm kind of a nerdy and all the years on study and college paid off and feels like it's an advantage with the talks and stuff. It feels like she's interested not because of my physical appearence but actually because I'm a funny and talk-interesting-stuff type of guy. 

And also, I'm clearly not his type. I'm a normal guy, not ugly but not an 6-pack gym pass dude rat. Her type before of guys were always a more 6-pack style rather than guys like me, nerdy and average level of atractiveness. That's why sometimes I feel like I'm just wondering stuff when I think she's into me. 

Any tips on someone who was in the same place before? Or tips of ""how-to-flirt-with-someone-really-confident"" type of stuff?
