So I've never experienced what it's like to be on a first date but from what I've read on here and chatting to people, Kissing/Making out seems to be really common (If the date is good of course) but how many dates or how long before you decide to initiate sex with them? Or is this something that just happens in the moment and you see where it goes?

Dating is definitely something I would like to maybe dip I to but I want to go about it the right way and just be myself which is a nice kind caring and genuine guy looking for someone special to be a good man for them but also best friend!

We've went on two dates and we would have had sex the second date except I had to pull an all nighter for work after dinner, so we're doing good chemistry wise.

I told her already I have no idea what to do at a club, and I've never been to one, and I don't know how to dance. She said not to worry it'll be okay, and I'll be dancing because I'll be high on party drugs that she's going to be bringing (I only drink and do a bit of weed myself so that's a new thing too but I'm chill about that). It's just her and me going.

So anyway, I'm not self conscious about looking like an idiot and I also don't think she'll judge me on anything, but just so I have SOME kind of direction...what the hell do I do at a club? She was incredibly nonplussed about the situation like it would be not a big deal at all, so beyond establishing with her I don't know what the hell I'm doing I didn't ask a lot of questions. She is a party girl so I assumed she knows what she's doing bringing me.

But still...is there something I can be doing between now and then to prepare? I'm a big nerd FWIW. For work I'm a game designer, and my usual saturdays are doing something at home like playing video games with my circle of friends (all nerds too), so this is a bit outside of my comfort zone and really outside my knowledge zone.

Some random Qs:

What do I wear?

Should I watch some videos on dancing?

As a couple, are there things I should do or things I'm not supposed to do? Do I stay with her all night?

She says the place opens at 11:30, so should I take a nap in the afternoon or what?

He then tells me a week or two after the breakup he is talking to his ex he dated for the same time as me but they never saw each other bc she lives far. A day after he blocks me on everything after promising to always be there for me as friends. It was a pleasant breakup even though I was hurt he had stayed on ft while I cried(always been sweet). But now i had recently asked him after a week of being blocked if he could unblocked me just bc I don’t like to be blocked and that he promised he’d always be there for me. He said the reason is that it was easier for him. He would only unblock my number (i texted him through a friends number) but not social media whatsoever(he doesn’t even post) even tho i said I wouldn’t add him anyways. After unblocking me he says *There. Now leave me alone*. I don’t understand why he changed so much. Idc that he doesn’t talk to me much but he is now rude.

He claims his ex was toxic and that I’m not so he’d keep me blocked which doesn’t make sense. He said she would nag him everytime he blocked her to unblock her.

Ive worked on it over the years but what’s helped the most is fitness and lifting weights. Recently I’ve gotten very serious about the gym and I’m approaching personal long time goals. I’m bulkier and more attractive “in my eyes” and it’s causing this shift in my attitude towards myself.

In the past I’ve always felt I needed to be on the same physical level as the women I would dream about dating. Now that I’m at that level, I have the confidence to really put myself out there and go after the type of women I’ve never had the confidence to talk to.

Ive never had trouble getting dates in the past but I do think, how I felt myself influenced the type of women I would approach and settle for. But the reality is women are women, looks don’t determine their taste. It won’t be any different. The only difference is how i feel about myself. 

Anyway. Ive never had this amount of confidence and self-worth and I have this fear that there’s this part of me that was never able to present itself, that being a skirt chaser. I love women. 

But I’m currently in a long distance relationship with a girl that I’m on the fence about. She’s really nice and I love her company but physically, I’d prefer someone more attractive. Part of me doesn’t want to mess up a possibility good thing but the other part of me that’s been hidden for most of my life feels like it’s missing out. 

I feel like I can truly find a woman I’d be mesmerized on all levels while at the same time don’t want to mess up something that might be great with the girl I’m seeing now

So one of them I basically made plans with and that was it. Not much more than a few texts here and there confirming and planning the date and then all set.

The other though, we have been texting non stop and have hit it off quite a bit. 

So with that, I'm super anxious. I've never been big in to dating and am not sure what the protocol is with all this. 2 people I have never met, 2 first dates in the same week, one I haven't talked to much and one I have had some great conversation with.

However, the main problem is, she is slow at replying. When I say slow, I mean really really slow. For example; In January this year, I only received 3 messages from her, on average 1 message every 10 days. There were also times when her replies were after 2 weeks. On other hand, I know she is studying, working a part-time job, and pursuing a hobby, all together, so she doesn't want to spend the remaining time she has on mobile.

I even confronted her about this 3 times, but every time she apologized. She said she is just slow at responding in general, not just to me, and said she will try to reply sooner.

Now I am confused, considering I told her about how I feel and she also said the same. I am also scared to confront her again, thinking I might lose her (*or lose anything that we have going right now*).

She also opened to me about her personal life, that she has never been in a relationship before and that she was assaulted a couple of years ago. I told her I was sorry and it wasn't her fault.

For the last 4 months I've been dating this girl ""Shira"". Shira and I met online, we weren't looking for a relationship. However, we had a unique spark and began spending a lot of time together.

Shira is not the type of girl I would normally feel comfortable dating. On our second date she asked me my thoughts on ""ethical non-monogamy"" and I said I wasn't interested. She's a very talented and accomplished artist and I'm a high-level business professional, so her lifestyle and social circle is much more liberal than mine. For example, most of her friends have open relationships/swing, she drinks and parties way more frequently than I do and she will do things like go to a guy from a bar's apartment with her friend, meet with her last longterm ex while on a trip, or sleep over at her male coworkers place.

Shira's always been very transparent with me though. I don't pry too much into her life, so most of the ""boundary pushing"" things I know about her are things that she tells me directly. At first I extended my boundaries because, well, we hadn't had a conversation about exclusivity so it wasn't my place. As time went on I realized that, honestly, I trust her. If she was sleeping with other people I'm sure she would tell me and our relationship wouldn't have grown in the way it did.

However, at the beginning of the month we were lying in bed and Shira asked me ""what we were"". I responded that we were dating, I was exclusive with her and would like her to tell me if she was sleeping with anyone else. I expected us to be ""in a serious relationship soon, but it's a little early for that right now"". I asked her, multiple times, if she was comfortable with this answer and she said yes.

The reason I wanted to wait to move forward is because Shira is very sure she wants kids and seems to think it's getting ""too late"" for her to get pregnant (I disagree), so she's planned on adopting in the future. I'm not sure if I want kids, but I don't want them soon. If I don't have kids of my own, I definitely don't want to adopt. It's a big conversation and I didn't think either of us knew each other well enough to decide how we wanted to compromise.

After this conversation we go on a valentines day trip. It's amazing, we both have so much fun. I planned on continuing our relationship conversation when we got back - and then one of my best friend's and business partner got diagnosed with terminal cancer. I'm fucking broken.

Shira has to go to Philly for a convention. While we're texting and looking at her social media I see a guy I know she has a deep emotional connection with pop up \*alot\*...my friends do too and ask me about it. I begin to realize, from her SM and texts, that they may be living together. I ask her ""hows her hotel"" in one text message and she doesn't address my question. I ask her again and she texts me that she ""forgot"" to tell me she's living in this guys place, says he was very sweet and bought an air mattress just for her. She sends me a picture of a bare air mattress with no sheets or covers on it. My friends think this is super fucking weird, I do too. I tell her I don't think she forgot to tell me, that she just wanted to avoid drama. She tells me I'm wrong, for many reasons, but she's at a bar so she can't send me a voice memo to explain. We fight a bit, she says we'll discuss this in person when she gets back - I basically say no need because I want to end our relationship.

We fight for the next two days. She says I'm being ""nonsensical and demanding"" meanwhile my friends are convinced she's sleeping with this dude and I'm not respecting myself by even entertaining staying with her. She keeps posting stories on SM with this dude partying while we're fighting, she tells me he has a girlfriend - but I never see her in any pictures she's posting (it's always her next to this dude). She's adamant though that they have a completely platonic relationship.

My friends are incredibly surprised I'm putting up with this, since usually I'm strong willed with my boundaries and am able to endure a lot of emotional pain. But Shira has a tendency to have too close emotional relationships with other men - it's another one of the reasons I was hesitant to date her. I'm pretty sure she's not fucking this guy because who would be dumb enough to tell me they're living together and post about him on social media?

Saturday night we both worked, Sunday every time I called her she was with this dude and then she went to party all night so we can't talk in private. We initially agree to talk Tuesday - but I change my mind and tell her ""I'm uncomfortable and will take space until she can make time to have this conversation"". She immediately moves up our conversation to as soon as I'm available Monday.

Our conversation was very emotional. I asked Shira many questions. She's still adamant that her relationship with this guy is completely platonic and they've never been physical (in fact she tells me she's feeling shitty because he agrees with me). She agrees that she's been very callous with my trust and that she's asking for a lot of it. She says she didn't tell me her living arrangements because ""I never asked"". I ask her, if I trusted her, why would I think that I need to ask her questions like that? This seems to make her begin to realize what she's done.

She finally admits that she was standoff-ish because I didn't agree to be ""official"". I tell her I wanted to wait until after the valentines day trip, and then remind her right when we got back my friend started fucking dying. She begins to cry and, when I ask her if she was my friend what would she tell me to do, she says she would tell me not to date her.

Last night I got a brief text from her. The text says everything she should have said the first night I asked her about her living arrangements. She's invested in me, this guy is just a friend and that he has a girlfriend, they sleep in separate rooms. I didn't deserve what she's done, she didn't think this through but after our conversation and she feels awful.

I don't know how to move forward. Knowing Shira, I do believe she's just massively fucked up because she was frustrated by the slow(er) pace of our relationship. She didn't need to tell me about living with this guy and I've seen her have these platonic but deep emotional relationships with other men.

On the other hand, she just sent me a 2 paragraph text and I don't even know what the fuck to do with that. Nothing about the situation or her actions has changed (she's still living with this guy, just posted with him again on social media).

TLDR: Girl I'm seeing went to Philadelphia to live with another guy for 8 days without telling me beforehand. She's adamant it's platonic and I'm not sure whether to trust her.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162639,public,self,Is Her Staying With Another Guy Right Before We Start A Relationship Ok?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t4kzni/is_her_staying_with_another_guy_right_before_we/,no_ads,0.0,,,

Woman posts something on social media and gets 30+ DMs that day showering her with compliments and attention, in hopes that she will reply to and maybe even flirt/go out with one of them. Spoiler alert, she doesn't. 

What this does is give this woman the illusion of being wanted, it bloats her ego thinking she can get any man she wants

The end result is:

You'll end up 30 years old and single, wondering why none of the women want you. You gave them the attention they craved but they never reciprocated. You'll feel jaded and maybe even bitter.

Her ego was bloated and she thought she could do much better than the average normal guys that were trying to get her attention. Result is she slept around or ""casually dated"" up until she was 30. The attention has now dried up, she is no longer in her prime and getting the same kind of attention anymore, and it only gets worse unless she gets lucky.

Generally I just do not believe he is husband material despite him suggesting he would like something serious ""but wouldn't rule out anything else"".

I'm 33 years old and I have permanent erectile dysfunction from a med I took when I was younger. This pretty much destroyed my sexual confidence, and I freeze up with any sort of intimacy.

I matched with this woman on Hinge. First date we clicked perfectly. We went out on 3 other days, but I would always get super caught up in my own head. We did nothing but pecks here and there.

We were supposed to go out on a 5th date, but we both had to reschedule twice. The day of our 5th date, she sent me a message saying:

""I feel like we're not moving in a romantic direction. I truly enjoyed spending time with you, but I just look at you as a friend.""

I wrote back saying I do want to move in a romantic direction, and told her how much I cared about her. I left a voice mail, and she called me and said she meant everything she said.

I said if I had to do it all over again, I would have kissed you more. I think I just friend zoned myself is all. She said ""it wouldn't have made a difference and there was nothing you could have done differently.""

In my guy brain, I think she's just unaware that it would have made a difference. Going on pleasant dates with nothing happening she just lost interest is all. We didn't make out once, and when she tried, I froze up and backed off. I'm sure my sexual unconfidence painted me with ick.

This was 3 months ago. I just can't get over her. I have went out on six other first dates, and this sounds bad, but it's just trash. Low interest, ghosting, clunky conversation. Every bad date I go on just reminds me of how great she is, and how interested she was initially. She gave me sooo many opportunities for make outs to happen.

I hired a therapist, but the therapist is kind of useless.

Should I message her on the app and ask ""How have you been?""

This sounds bad, but I'm just in so much pain every single day, and I just can't get over it. To use a bad analogy, it's a woman who had sexual trauma in her life, and she finally meets a guy who she likes, but she freezes up a lot and the dude just moves on and now she's heart broke. That's kind of what happened to me.

Recently I have decided after a 6 year hiatus (focusing on my professional life) to get back into dating. It’s been a bit difficult and overwhelming navigating the territory and I’d appreciate honest thoughts on the following below:

- What is the age range where you think I’d find the most success in today’s dating pool? My preference is typically younger versus older (like mid 20’s versus early 30’s) but I’ve always dated older in the past (1-2 years) so I don’t have a reference point on what’s acceptable and works in a serious relationship with larger age gaps.

- Where are the best places for me to focus my efforts in meeting and connecting with single women? I’d describe myself as a more reserved academic type of personality.

- Is online dating worth my time as an option? If so which apps or services?

Additional information: I’m from the NE USA moving to the south, I am fairly introverted but can be conversational or outspoken when I feel comfortable and I’m looking for long term dating/ultimate marriage as my goal.

As the title says I am a person with a form of Alopecia (scarring caused by living with untreated Trichotillomania for over a decade) and I am now looking to begin dating (woohoo). Problem is: I have scarring alopecia and I am kinda chubby. With those 2 things combined I have found out a few things:

1. I do not get a lot of matches in general which is apparently uncommon for my sex
2. The matches I do get usually people who seem to be very desperate for a relationship and do not actually care about me and my interests. And the very few that are not that first catagory usually do not stick around long
3. It is VERY HARD to find other people with alopecia (of any form) which sucks because even though my case is kinda self inflicted, I still would prefer to be with a person who gets my struggle to some degree. 

I have have read through a lot of advice online regarding the problem of not getting matches but none of it seems to really help. Like my profile is already pretty good as far as dating profiles go. It has flattering current pictures of me (I am wearing a head covering but I did not think that would be an issue). It talks about my hobbies which are unique but are not anything that would raise red flags. And I try to reach out to people in a way that usually refrences something we both have in common on our profiles (like shared interests or musical taste). But so far I am doing pretty terrible as far as matches and conversations are concerned. And I am not going to lie: I am starting to think it is because of how I look and not because of anything I said or did. 

I wanted to see if there were any alopecia exclusive/focused dating sites but those do not really seem to be a thing that exist. There is ONE site that caters to people with hairloss but it is hard to use from a technical standpoint and most of the people who use it are men several decades older than me (I am 19 and most were 35 and up). 

I am not going to lie I am getting very frustrated with how things are going. The people I have dated before were nice enough but I do not think many of them truly understood what I go through living with hairloss as... well... not a man. A big point of contention in those relationships was my disorder and them not understanding their advice of ""just fix it"" does not help. And I honestly feel just trying to online date the traditional way being a person with alopecia just is going to lead to more disappointment on my end. I have come to terms with the fact I will not look like the instagram model most dudes look for. The fact I have a form of hairloss does not bother me in that sense. But I am also frustrated with the fact that I cannot find more people like me out there both online or in person that I can better relate to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am really at a loss about what to really do from here. Even though my case is not as bad as other cases of alopecia I feel like its still fucking up my dating chances. And I honestly hate how hard it is to find other people like me that are my age.
