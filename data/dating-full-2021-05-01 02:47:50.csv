The only reason we headed to Starbucks is because I recently got a new dog, and she really loves dogs so we both agreed to take him along. We got him a puppuccino, Sandra and I just got a few drinks and left. We went to a dog park to play with Leo a little. After that we took Leo (my husky) back home and we started to spend the rest of the time like a real date. We went to this fancy restaurant and enjoyed or time! Then we went to a basketball court and started playing (we both love basketball). And me being the nice gentleman I payed for everything my ps5 savings all gone.... Anyways I might buy Sandra a new phone she uses her phones mom, so she doesn't have a real one since we didn't spend all my ps5 savings, we went to a mall, I had to go to the ""restroom"" but I went to the apple store and bought her a Iphone X. I had my dad's credit card. I use that card to store all the money I make from online jobs  (like making games for people).

I just want to check that I’m not reacting solely out of pride (I would say I have a healthy-sized ego, and I have enough very close friends who work as doctors to know that maybe he’s actually busy, but, lol, my ego doesn’t care about the facts) and that most people would say my initial message is enough for him to not feel discouraged from reaching back out.

Now I have had a crush on Chloe for a while now. I guess i have just always felt close to her.

Anyway lately Ben has been shipping me and Chloe and we have been trying to figure out his goal. Well I found out what his goal is.

Ben likes Chloe too. He has been shipping us to hide the fact that he likes her. Now I have been planning to ask her out for quite a while now. Now I wouldn't feel right if I did.

Ben has been picked on by people his whole life. His parents have looked at him and told him he will never have a girlfriend because he is too much of an asshole (which yeah he can be at times) Part of me wants to be with Chloe, but another part of me wants to prove his dick head parents wrong and let him have a win for once.

I don't know what to do. I don't know if i should ask her out still or If i should let my best friend in the whole world go for her first. I'm not sure what to do. I have never loved anyone like I love Chloe, but I feel like If I go for her I am betraying my bestfriend.

Now me and Ben have talked about the situation and we pretty much just agreed to the terms of who goes for her first. He also told me he feels intimidated by me because of how much me and Chloe hangout lately.

He was a regular customer at my job and we had been flirting a bit before and the last time he came in he gave me his number. He wanted to meet up for dinner but I was busy preparing for a vacation. During my trip we texted and FaceTimed and we had planned to meet up when I got back. I returned Thursday night and told him my plane landed. He texted me a few hours later asking if I made it home safely. I didn’t answer until the next morning and told him I made it to work safely. I didn’t get an answer. In the afternoon I texted him again asking him what he was doing. No answer and he didn’t even open the message. 

It’s only been about 24 hours since we last spoke but we went from messaging or FaceTiming a little bit everyday to nothing. He travels a lot for his job so that could be the reason he hasn’t responded. Should I call him after I sent 2 back to back texts? Did I get ghosted or is he just going through something personal? 

I have other guys I’m talking to on dating apps who want to take me out but I wanted to meet this guy first since I already know what he looks like and we had a bit of chemistry. He’s tall and attractive IMO. So I could be just getting ghosted. I’m stereotyping here of course. 

I’m just not sure if I should call him or wait for him to answer me. Should I respond back immediately if he texts me? I’m not sure what to do in this situation.

He had to move back home to the east coast (I live on the west) for a while and has been gone for about 2 months now. We text daily and have been planning a trip for my birthday. Recently he's been having family issues (his cousin committed suicide, his aunt died, his mom &amp; other aunt have him in the middle of issues regarding selling their grandma's house, etc.) So he's back and forth from where he lives and his hometown. Recently we haven't been talking as much and I've felt him distracted. 

So yesterday I brought it up and told him I felt like his attention was elsewhere, and if he felt like it was not a good time to try and build something together. He said maybe. I told him I understood and asked if he wanted to break it off. 
He said ""Before I lose you 100% do you think it's responsible? Before you get totally turned off let's back up and take a break before I lose you as a friend and girlfriend."" I was hesitant because I don't really believe in breaks. He said it's worked for him in the past. So I ask how long does he want it to be and he says he can't answer because it's no specific date. He's just had a lot going on unexpectedly and wants to clear the air mentally.

So I thought about it, and since I feel like he's serious, I opt in to consider a break with some boundaries. I ask him if he considered us both still exclusive or single, and to discuss a realistic time frame so that no time is wasted. He said he wanted to remain exclusive, and that he would be back in my city within a month, so we could revisit the situation within that time. 

Do you think this is viable? Am I wasting my time, should I move on? Or should I respect him and let him deal with his family issues and revisit in a month? Thanks!

I’m sitting at work one day minding my own business, when I get an email from a client. They’d like to get a user set up with an account on the domain and ready to work remotely. Sounds good, I can handle that.

I call the user and I’m met with a soothing, friendly female voice. I had set up some pieces of her profile on the backend before calling, but there was plenty of other stuff that needed to be set up on her device, requiring us to be on the phone together for some time. Normal work business-casual conversation to start. There are folders of travel photos all over her desktop, I mention something about it and she excitedly opens one up and starts showing me one of her trips as if I’ve know her for.. well, more than 20 minutes. She's laughing at all my stupid jokes and even her laugh is pleasant, infectious and keeping a smile on my face. At one point I mention something about Hakuna Matata and without missing a beat she breaks into song with the confidence of someone singing in the shower. Consider me intrigued. Throughout the course of this conversation I’m struck at how every response makes me smile a little bit more, with that magnetic voice reeling me in. Who is this unabashed stranger? I type her name into Facebook and find her moments later. Damn. She’s beautiful. She's smiling in every photo and it's warm, genuine, these aren't filtered selfies for attention, it's a woman living her best life. I ask if she minds if I add her on Facebook, she says she doesn’t mind at all.

Still, let's be reasonable. I'm just a guy on the phone working on her computer, there’s no reason to think she’s flirting with me. What I'm wishfully interpreting as a little chemistry is probably just her unshakably positive attitude and she likely makes a lot of people feel this way by nature of that positivit-- DID SHE JUST ASK ME OUT FOR DRINKS WHEN THINGS OPEN UP? Oh shit.

Okay okay still- she's just being friendly. Don't be lame and read into things. Right? She's sending me winky faces and HAHA's, goes out of her way to tell me that she's gonna have to be professional for a while since she’s in the office now, gotta reign in being so playful ;-)

Damn this sure feels like attraction. Dad catches her snickling even! And cat memes, already? Woah woah girl slow down, we barely know each other. That's like stage 4 relationship chatter. I'm officially interested, I know what I like. It's her, it's definitely her, I feel that youthful excitment for even the slim possibility of something special.

Now she's responding to some of my messages with heart-eyes emojis, she's flirting with me, there's no way I'm misinterpreting all of these signs. Just accept it man, she's into you! Yes!!! I check with a couple of my closest lady friends to make sure I’m not going crazy, the signs I’m seeing are legitimate. I'm reassured. I'm patient and in absoutely no rush, and for the moment I'm on cloud nine. It might be nothing, I might be imaginining it all, but regardless it feels good to feel this way about somebody.

But oh man what terrible timing. The ultimate irony is that without COVID-19 I wouldn't even know who this person is. The pandemic was the catalyst for getting her set up on the network so I accept my blessings, the good with the bad. I know I'm not going to get the chance to see her in person anytime soon, and the last thing I want to do is try to insert myself into somebody elses life. She's a full-grown adult, she has 24 hours a day full of her own cares and concerns. And we really still barely know each other. All I want is the chance to get to know her, to meet in person so I can figure out if this connection is real and mutual, or in my head. I have to be patient. No problem.

But I know timing is important in life and relationships. My fear at this point is that the spark we have is going to extinguish from lack of oxygen long before I ever get the chance to meet her. I have to stay on her radar but again I can't force myself into her life. Just be friendly, try to help feed her smiles, not that she needs it, and let things happen naturally.

Okay well she’s gone MIA, it’s been a week since I sent a message, no reply. Did I say something wrong? Nah man she’s just busy, doing her own thing, hell it’s clear she’s not about being on social media all the time, which is great, she probably hasn’t even seen the message yet. Relax, enjoy the ride.

See, she responded, still friendly and playful :) Be patient.

I would like to talk to her though. That voice.. I could use a little more of it in my life. Ask her for a phone call. She responded, not a fan of phone calls I guess but she invited me to a zoom meeting with her friends! I have to, no question. Oh and hey! She’s sending me voice messages now :-) That smile the first time I listened to that message- there it is. Can’t fake that smile. Damn son, you’re enamored. This is getting dangerous, don’t forget what happens when you allow yourself to feel. Cool it, be guarded. That’s how you date these days anyway, apparently. Definitely can’t show the other person you’re interested, gotta act like you don’t care. That’s what I’m told.

Zoom meeting was fun! It’s hard not to stare at her. Cool it. Ugh okay she sent three of the smiley-surrounded-by-hearts emojis. Be cool. Be cool.

Another group zoom invite? I’m in for sure. We’re transitioning from one activity to the next and I step away for a few minutes. I come back and the group is down to four people, her and I included, but everybody had stepped away from their computers. I turn off my video momentarily. She comes back, don’t be creepy turn the video back on. Wait, she’s reading the last couple private messages I sent her! “You look really nice”, I said. “Especially in that hat”, I said. [she was wearing a funny hat] She reads, lets out a brief but ear-to-ear smile before speaking “especially in that hat” quietly to herself &lt;3 &lt;3 I wonder if she sees that those messages were sent 15 minutes apart?.. Favorite part of the entire evening, by far.

Sleeping on cloud nine again tonight, the littlist things can mean so much sometimes.

More voice messages. I love it, can't get enough.

I gotta meet her. This spark won't survive forever in a vacuum. Outdoor movie night, let's do this. She says she'd love to join! Hmm... how do I clearly let her know I'm interested while social distancing? Hard to have a meaningful conversation about it from six feet away with friends around. And do I hug her when we meet? If she's not okay with it, would be a quick and easy way to ruin the evening, should probably ask to be clear...

She didn't like that. Another week between responses. She's busy, man, it's nothing personal...

Try to be playful. Hmpf well she didn't appear to like that either.

Maybe I was wrong. Maybe I misread everything. Maybe something I said upset her. Maybe someone else caught her attention. Maybe she was never interested and I mistook her friendly demeanor to mean something more, because I wanted to. Regardless, it’s the third time she's gone a week without reading or responding to my messages. I’m not angry in the slightest, just a little disappointed. 

Mostly in myself. Let it go.

The end.

I was going to send this the following day when she finally responded to my latest message, still playful and seemingly flirty. She did end up coming over for two outdoor movie nights at my place.

Worried that I'm going to eff up another one with a girl I'm going out with soon.

&amp;#x200B;

I (21M) haven't really dated that much ever. I had a girlfriend right after high school and I lost interest in her really fast. I attributed this to not being in a good place mentally (I was very depressed back then and didn't really feel like interacting with people that much). Then I began college and for the first 3 years, I must have been on 2 dates in total, and sometimes it bothered me that I didn't have a significant other, but even then, the primary reason for this was that I wasn't quite interested in anyone around me. I had occasional hookups but I never quite maintained a relationship with the person.

I was stuck at home for about 6 months during the pandemic in 2020, which gave me a lot of time to work on myself and I came out of it a much better person IMO. So when I returned to college, I noticed that I was getting a lot of attention from women around me, which felt quite empowering. Still, even with a better chance with a lot of women that I never really thought were in my league, I felt like I wasn't quite interested in them that much to ask them out or keep going out with them. This is strange, as some of my closest friends are women - I love them so much and never feel like I'm losing any interest in them, but as soon as I start dating somebody it takes 2-3 dates and I don't really know what to talk about anymore.

So November 2020, I said ""Fuck it, I have to put myself out there otherwise I will die single"". Using dating apps, being introduced to people by my friends and just randomly bumping into nice strangers, I started going out a lot more. I knew that at least in the beginning, especially with strangers, I was going to have a tough time vibing with someone hard enough to keep going out with them, and my end goal was to get serious with somebody rather than hooking up casually. I knew it was going to be a bit of trial and error. I met some amazing women - smart, independent and driven, just my type. But for one reason or another, I found myself being detached from them after a few dates, even though they were clearly into me.

At this point, I have ended as many of my budding relationships as I've tried to start. I don't think I'm bad at dating - I always excitedly go into second and third dates with more to look forward to, but once I feel like I have successfully been able to get someone interested in me, I lose my interest in them. I am really disturbed by this honestly, because it feels super problematic to me. Something deep inside me says that it's because I am always looking for somebody better, which is a terrible thought process.

At the moment, I've been going out with this amazing lady I met off Bumble for about a month now. For the longest time I felt like this could be it, but last Friday, after a few drinks at a bar, I felt kind of uncomfortable around her. Felt like I was faking my interest in her. I didn't feel like kissing her when she went for it. It kinda scared me. So, I ended things with her as well.

Over the last few days, I met someone else off Bumble again, and the energy is just different between us. She is such a kind soul and any of our conversations feel so natural. I don't feel like I have to act like somebody else when I'm around her. I'm meeting her for the first time on Monday to study together, and I know it's going to be really fun and we'll probably end up meeting again. But I am so afraid that I'll end up losing my interest in her and break her heart too.

I have considered the possibility that I may be aromantic, one of my friends is and our experiences seem to be similar, but the thought of being with somebody and building experiences together is still quite enticing to me. I am also bisexual, so I have tried going out with men as well, but those experiences feel very similar to this.

So I just wanted to ask any of you with more experience dating than I do if this was something normal or if I should stop trying to date for a while and work on myself a little bit more. Any advice is much appreciated.

Thanks to everybody who ends up reading this huge wall of text. I'm sorry if some things I may have mentioned feel a bit problematic.

I told her that I've haven't been in a relationship and that I've only been on one date, and she had only been in one relationship for around 7 months before things ended badly. She had been on a couple of dates since then, but was also messed around on.  

We ended up planning a date for Sunday and added each other on Facebook and Instagram.  

We messaged all day for a couple of days and she mentioned that she couldn't pay her car insurance, so I offered to help her out with it. She said thanks for the offer but she'll be alright so I just said to her, if you need to borrow money then you doesn't have to feel bad or embarrassed about asking.  

Day later we're messaging and she just did she sorry for asking but could she borrow £120 for insurance to go get shopping and see her grandad. I sent her £150 to help her out in case she needed anything else. She was very appreciative about it and asked if we could meet up once I had finished work, which we did.  

We had a drive down to the town next to ours and walked her dog along the seafront for a while and decided to get a McDonald's. We just sat in the car park chatting and listening to music while feeding her dog, then had long and slow drive back singing and chatting. We parked up just down the road from mine. We had a long hug, resting our heads on each others shoulders. We broke away and said thank you for a really enjoyable night out, then we made out for a while.  

Texted some more and another couple of days later we went on another date after I finished work, done the same thing and had a drink outside a pub as well and ended up the same way as the previous night.   Tomorrow will be our third date and I'm pretty sure the plan is to just to go round to her place and watch a film while cuddling.  

We've been pretty open, honest, caring and genuinely interested in each other. The other day when I said I haven't sold anything at the place I work at (was a quiet and slow day), she offered to come down and buy something so I made a sale. I told her how much it means to me that she would do that.

I've pretty much reached the end of my emotional line with dating. Online dating is my only option during the pandemic I find it soul destroying for all the typical reasons.

I had been trying to get some clarity on where we were heading prior to that to which she was vague but insisted she liked me. I was kind of stung by it, but it wasn't devastating by any means.

I want to ask this girl if she would be down for trying something casual, with no expectations of it going anywhere. I would honestly not be going into it with any sort of hope of it developing into anything more. I find her really attractive and I enjoyed the sex, plus we click on a lot of things personality wise.

There's a small voice in the back of my head wondering if this is a good idea. I am fairly confident she'd say yes, but the way I was 'broken up' with wasn't super respectful. That was well over half a year ago, though. Since then we chat fairly reguarly in small doses, maybe once a week or so.

Ok so i've been seeing this girl for a time now, like 3 months or more. We already had 5 dates and everything ok, those dates have been great. However she almost never starts texting and sometimes she doesn't respond at all.

I never had feelings for him and I never wanted our relationship to become anything more than it was.

The thing is that I wanted him to be in love with me and I don't really know why. I can't explain it. I was aware that him having any feelings for me would only ruin our whole thing. I knew I couldn't reciprocate those feelings and I didn't want him to be hurt either. It was just a need that I had.

We were both very clear about the nature of our relationship. He doesn't like commitment and he never really had a girlfriend, except when he was like 16. In fact, I was the only person he slept with more than once, he would usually just hook up with girls for one night. I liked to be in relationships, but he just wasn't someone that I would ever wanna be with. 

We would go out only when we wanted to have sex. Later on, he wanted to hang out with me more. He would say that we don't have to have sex always, that we can just hang out sometimes. That seemed really weird to me because we would never usually do that and I didn't want to.

At one point I was over that whole thing with him and I didn't like having casual sex anymore, so I stopped seeing him. We didn't hear from each other for a year. I had a boyfriend (23M) and the relationship with that guy was really bad and toxic, so I broke up with him. I wanted something casual again, so I contacted my former fuck buddy. We went out to have sex a couple of times, but I just wasn't feeling it anymore, so I was thinking about not seeing him anymore.

Then one day he asked me out and I said I don't feel like having sex. He said that he's really horny, that I can just suck his dick, but I said I'm not in the mood. Turns out that was just an excuse to spend time with me, so he said he's bored and has nowhere to go and asked if I wanted to just hang out. That was another excuse and I realised what was really going on, but I felt bad, so I said yes.

We drove to this beach and the whole thing looked really romantic. He joked about how romantic it was and that we look like a couple (he would always make fun of anything romantic or anything related to relationships). He even jokingly put his arm around me and we both felt so awkward and embarrassed when he did that. Being there with him was really weird and I didn't know what to do and neither did he.

We knew each other for so long and I was always comfortable around him, but at that moment I couldn't be more uncomfortable. I knew him longer than I knew any of my boyfriends, but he didn't really know the real me. I never opened up to him and he perceived me as this cold and distant person, which I'm not, but I was like that forwards him. I always thought of him as this emotionless person that isn't capable of being in love, but then I realised I was just perceiving him the same way he was percieving me.

He never confessed his feelings and I acted like I didn't notice anything, but I know that my wish came true: he was in love with me.  I felt so bad about ever wishing that. When it really happened, it was the last thing I ever wanted. I feel like a bad person for ever wishing that and I still think about that whole situation.

Texted her and she seemed less interested. Not that we’re back at school we are talking more often. Recently she looked up how far our post school holiday destinations are from each other and said that we should meet up.

—————————

I’ve known this girl for a few years through school, but had never really spoken to her until a party earlier this year (our last year of high school) where she started talking to me. I’m normally pretty shy and find it kind of hard to hold a conversation with someone I don’t know, but with her it was (and still is) easy. We have a lot in common and I feel like she’s relatively perfect for me. We talked for a couple of hours, still hanging around our mutual friends but having a conversation between just the two of us. It was straight after this that I started to like her. She approached me again at another party a few weeks later and we talked until the end of the party again.

In both of these conversations we talked a lot about movies, which is a shared interest of ours. A few days after the party, I watched a movie she recommended and texted her on Snapchat about it. Initially she responded quickly, but over time it took longer and longer for her to reply, leaving me waiting for a few hours at times. While this is clearly a bit of a bad sign, she told me recently that she doesn’t have Snapchat notifications on, so I’m hoping that can explain this. But do you think this is a big deal?

Now that we’re back at school we’ve been talking a little bit every day. Just small conversations, usually about the classes we have together. 
A few days ago we both stayed after school to get some homework done (we didn’t arrange to do this it was just a coincidence that we were both there). We sat together and talked for a couple of hours while doing work, and in this conversation a couple of things happened that I’m hoping are signs she likes me. 

First, she asked if I’d ever been to this old cinema in our city. At first I thought it was a kind of random thing to bring up. But looking back, there’s a part of me that feels like it was a hint to ask her out, or at least a subtle suggestion for where we could go if I ask her out later on.

Second, we were talking about where we will be going for schoolies (a post high school celebration in my country). After I told her where I was going SHE LOOKED UP HOW FAR IT WAS FROM WHERE SHE WOULD BE, AND SAID THAT WE SHOULD MEET UP. She is a very friendly person, but I feel like above everything else, this has to be a sign of something.

I’m just looking for an outside opinion on this, because I’ve been overthinking everything we’ve said to each other.

I was expecting him to walk me home, like up to my door or check on me afterwards but nothing. He just said we can see each other when he is back after the weekend. I said ‘see you around’. I just felt like I came across so arrogant and wish I took the time to get him know better. I don’t think he is going to contact me again, obvs he is away now and I don’t want to come across too desperate, in fact I don’t even know if we were a good match because I couldn’t be fully present on the date - I was thinking about dropping him a msg just to say I was a little nervous because he is so beautiful and bit stressed from work but either way I had a good time?!

So around 6 weeks ago, a girl [20] messaged me [24,M] on tinder and we hit it off really well.. My favourite thing about her was just generally how excited she seemed to talk to me, like the constant flirting and some of the things she would say just indicated she was really interested in me. She told her family and friends and colleagues all about me, literally every little detail she knew. 

We met up after 2 weeks and we hit it off really well, to the point where 5 minutes after she left, she already messaged me asking to meet up a few days later.

We live in the UK so you essentially have to book a table for food and drinks at the minute. The day before we met, I asked if she'd done it (she lives in a village i have never been to) she said no because she wanted me to chill at her house instead. I explained I thought it was a little too soon as I wasn't her boyfriend yet and it's too early for me to meet her family etc but eventually I agreed. But even before this, she seemed to stop with the cute messages and I was getting alot more blunt replies when I was genuinely keeping the conversation going as normal, asking questions, flirting etc. 

The morning of our meet, she was complaining about stomach cramps and I continuously let her know throughout the day that we could always rearrange. But she insisted I come and I did.

She seemed generally happy to see me, I got on well with her parents and we had a good time... Until around 8pm...she randomly looked at me and asked when I was getting the train home.. I told her that she told me to get the 9:50pm train and she looked at me again and asked if there was an earlier train....i was really taken back by this as she clearly wanted me to leave. I told her there wasn't but I could always wait at the train station until one arrived but then she said she didn't mean for it to sound bad and after alot of backwards and forwardsxi stayed until the agreed time.

5 minutes after I left, she text me as normal and after a few messages, I said ""I had a good night, thank you"" and she replied with ""aww"" which once again kinda hurt so I tested the waters again by saying ""thanks for making me feel comfortable in your own home, I'm looking forward to seeing you again"" and once again she said ""aww""

The messages only got more blunt after the weekend... But here's where things got worse... Every single morning she would message me saying good morning and I would message her at 12pm (on my lunch break) saying good afternoon and ask how her day was. So on Monday that still happened... However after my message she replied with ""Hi, u ok?"" and I was just... ""what is going on in my head""

So I got really annoyed and politely asked if I was annoying her and she said no and I explained everything that had happend and I was just feeling like I was annoying her.

She replied telling me I wasn't but she was going through alot of personal issues and that I've really hurt her feelinfs by asking that.

I Appologised as I didn't know she was going though anything and after some back and forth, I said it would be a good idea if we took a break that night and she could message me whenever she felt comfortable again or never again if I hurt her that much...

She replied exactly 24 hours later... To the second... Saying she was sorry she didn't message me sooner but she was having issues etc and I said it was okay. We kept talking and she told me again I really hurt her etc but I let her know if she was going through a bad time I'd still be there for her and she said ""if I wasn't interested, I'd let you know instead of leading you on""

The rest of the week has kinda been the same blunt one sided messages and I really don't wanna do it anymore... I liked her when we first started talking so I don't know what's happened... She was getting really jealous of me meeting my best friend today who she knows is a lesbian and to calm her down I told her I only had eyes for her and she just put ""yeah I know"" so I'm kinda thinking thats the last straw but I'm looking for any advice... Like I think she's clearly not interested but she's the one who will message me every single morning without fail, and if I take too long to reply... She asks where I am etc so I just can't get a read on her...",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,748391,public,self,Shall I cut her off?

I have confidence issues when it comes to girls because of my lack of success and if I'm being honest I'm also pretty desperate. I always try my hardest to hide these feeling which I think I'm good at since I don't show a lot of emotion by nature. But people say girls can see through it no matter how much someone tries to hide it but idk how true that is. Look at it from my perspective and think if you would really be confident of you were put into my shoes. 

There are plenty of great things that I can bring to the table in a relationship. I try to go through life treating everyone with the kindness and respect they deserve. I'm not claiming to be a saint and I certainly am capable of getting mad an slipping up but I try my absolute hardest to be a positive person. I am very introverted by nature but because of this I've been called a great listener according to my female friends. I always remember minor details from conversations that happened weeks ago. I'm a very active person as well and I always go on runs/walks or play some basketball everyday. I'm actually confident in the way I look and the shape I'm in so I actually have confidence in some areas of my life but girls and relationships are certainly not one of them.

I know a ton of girls that have self esteem and confidence issues but it doesn't stop them from finding people but god forbid a guy has confidence issues then all the good things about him will be ignored and that one small issue will be put under a magnifying glass. It just seems hypocritical that tons of girls demand their partner has confidence coming out of their ass when they have the exact same self confidence issues I have. The point I'm trying to make is that there are plenty of good things that I can bring into a relationship but just cause I have confidence issues all the good things get thrown out and don't matter. Why is that? I've never understood that logic Nobody is perfect and everyone has their demons that they fight. We have to accept the bad parts of people along with the good.
