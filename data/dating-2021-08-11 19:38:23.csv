A month and a half ago I met a girl at a university I attend she is also from the same town as me so we kick it off pretty good and when I admit that I like her she says that she only sees me as a friend and I was ok with that not the first one certainly not the last one with that reply but throughout the next few days after my confession she played around me in a seductive kind of way to at some point she says that she wants me to kiss her, and on and on every other day sometimes it was from my own initiative sometimes from hers, but still she refused a relationship so she goes home to our town she constantly messaged me how she misses me and how she can't wait to see me. I come back a couple of days after her and we do some pretty intimate things together(you know what it is) and I was feeling that it was a step in the right direction, up until a couple of days ago when she said that we should not kiss anymore and that she again doesn't want a relationship. So a week passes while I was out on vacation and I realize that i have fallen deeply in love and that staying just as friends will not cut it as it will provide situations that provoke both of us and will anger us both, so i tell her that we should stop chatting and seeing each other for a while she said ok whatever would make you feel better. However today she sent a message congratulating my birthday and subsequently started saying that I was a lie and a deceit a trippy experience in her brain and she asked me how I feel and I said much better and she replied that she was sickened by me by the fact that i could disconnect her from my life in such a short time span. All I asked was a little bit of space between us until I can at least feel either significantly less towards her or even nothing in a romantic way because I did need that space because I have a job to fullfil and places to be present at and thinking about her and our status was taking a toll on my mental state.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p2q733/girl_i_liked_didnt_want_a_relationship_but_got/

3,p2qbiw,1628729621,My back hurts from carrying these boring conversations.,"This is just a mini rant but does anyone else struggle finding people that can hold a decent conversation on dating apps?
Like it‚Äôs hard enough for me to actually match with someone but usually when I do‚Ä¶I‚Äôm the one constantly carrying the conversation. There‚Äôs only so many ‚ÄúHow was your day‚Äùs or ‚ÄúWyd‚Äùs I can handle before I lose my freaking mind. 
Like normally I can hold a conversation with almost anyone. I‚Äôm very bubbly and empathetic (and I have ADHD which means I can talk for hours about a random topic), but I find most people I match with are so‚Ä¶boring? I usually ask questions and try to get to know folks and try to have conversations of substance but I can only do so much when it‚Äôs one-sided. 
Example: I started talking to a person for the last two week off a dating app. We exchanged snapchat and numbers but like‚Ä¶they‚Äôre so B O R I N G. I don‚Äôt expect not want to talk to them 24/7, but when we do, he just asks me ‚Äúwyd‚Äù or ‚Äúhow was your day‚Äù 15 freaking million times. I try so hard to hold an actual conversation with him but it‚Äôs like trying to talk to a sack of potatoes. 

I‚Äôm just really frustrated and disheartened. I‚Äôm trying to be intentional about dating bc I want to build a healthy, committed relationship but there‚Äôs so many barriers. I barely get any matched and when I do, the communication is non existent. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúspark‚Äù. 
And before you ask, I‚Äôm a qpoc living in a LARGE metropolitan city. You think it‚Äôd be easier for me but alas. üòîüòî

Another was ""I'm tryna get rich so don't be suprised if I choose my job over texting you back lol"" Like these are bios these days? But as men we get grilled on having a good profile?

Of course you also have the really good ones ""If your height starts with 5 swipe left and don't waste my time, sorry not sorry"" (says the 5ft woman smh)

Then I came across a female bisexual couple who actually shot me a like, I looked at the profile and seen the BLM tag so I knew why I was swiped ( I'm a black male) both of them look Hispanic and they were both pretty cute so I entertained the idea out of curiosity, went through the profile some more and found out they were interested in a third partner for some fun, but most of the pictures were strap ons and dildos smh nah fam, not about that life.

Then there's a girl I was actually getting ready to go meet up with, and when I said I was on my way, she asked me was I bringing her any money, smh this is crazy.

Am I overthinking the follow request? I'm not attracted to him physically or personality wise anymore and I wish him well so I'm not sitting here gushing about his follow request. I just find  it really odd after all these years I guess.

8,p2qo2p,1628730904,How do I ask my boyfriend to spend longer on foreplay? (Late 20s),"I‚Äôm 26F and have been dating 27M for about 3 months now. Most things are going pretty well but I have been wondering about sex and not sure how to talk about it.

I come from a pretty conservative background and as such, have only really had sex with 3 serious boyfriends in the past. First one was really bad, I didn‚Äôt enjoy it and would try to avoid it when possible. With the second ex, we rarely went all the way and were mostly doing foreplay/ oral stuff, but it was fun and he was very giving. With the last ex, it was the most regular sex I‚Äôve had, our sessions are usually really long, we did a lot of foreplay, I found out that I really enjoyed being touched, and the actual sex was also good but not as much as the foreplay. 

So I‚Äôm not super experienced, I haven‚Äôt tried a lot of things and it‚Äôs really difficult for me to orgasm. I think I‚Äôve only orgasmed 2x with my last ex (and none before him) from fingers and oral. I find it super awkward to talk about this topic.

My current boyfriend (we became official a month ago) likes sex a lot more than I do and also likes to talk about it (and has been understanding when I‚Äôm uncomfortable talking about this topic). He‚Äôs had a lot more partners (~20?) but mostly casual sex, with 3-4 exes, and he has admitted to watching a lot of porn in the past. He would always give me oral first when we have sex, and go down on me during sex too, but this is usually pretty short (~2-3min). I‚Äôm used to men spending much longer down there but I‚Äôm also so awkward about asking him to take his time more because it feels selfish. We have sex 2x a week and I‚Äôve never orgasmed with him. He also doesn‚Äôt touch me as much and jump very quickly to actual sex.

I‚Äôve brought this up once and it maybe changed for the next 1-2x we had sex before it went back to normal (and even those times I still felt it wasn‚Äôt long enough). How do I talk about this without sounding selfish? I also don‚Äôt know why he‚Äôs not spending more time even though I asked - maybe he thinks it‚Äôs enough already? He‚Äôs been very communicative during sex and always asked if I‚Äôm OK when we do new things so I feel like he does care. Do I bring this up before sex? After sex? Randomly? 

Also, I do enjoy penetrative sex, but foreplay does feel better for me. I guess the other hesitation is also that I know I won‚Äôt necessarily orgasm from foreplay either so it‚Äôs not like I can tell him that‚Äôs what I need in order to orgasm.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p2qo2p/how_do_i_ask_my_boyfriend_to_spend_longer_on/

About a year ago I met a really great lady (25) at a party who displayed a high level of interest.

She said she wasn‚Äôt sure (she‚Äôs a busy body) but perhaps over the weekend. I say I have Friday, does that work. She says yes, but she has to be at a night club at 1am-ish.

36,p2tdh8,1628745791,Meeting someone ‚Äúorganically‚Äù still happens- I promise,"I never thought I‚Äôd be the one to say that after trial and MANY errors of OLD for 3+ years.

I met someone who happened to be living in my apartment building, he always caught my attention. We never exchanged more than causal small talk, but the day he moved out, in early June, we managed to catch each other in the lobby (by chance or partial calculation on his part, who knows). In that moment, we finally spoke in depth and he asked for my number after months of only brief dialogue. 


It‚Äôs only been a couple of months- still so fresh and for that, exciting, but we‚Äôve been seeing each other consistently ever since.

I started to feel that I could comfortably go out there and date again. So I chat with a gal whom I‚Äôm enjoying messaging with. I ask if she wanted to meet and we agreed on a location.

I had a talk with a friend this morning about how the pandemic has been getting worse all of a sudden. After that, I started to feel that it might not be the best time to go out and meet new people, so I decided to tell her that maybe we don‚Äôt yet. I wanted to better assess the state of things before doing so, especially with how unpredictable it‚Äôs been.

It helps that she is fine with that, but a part of me felt upset as soon as I informed her that I changed my mind. I was actually excited to meet this person and potentially hit it off with someone new. I also think not meeting sooner can make a connection stagnant and nothing can really develop, so I did want to go. On the other hand, even though I‚Äôm vaccinated, I don‚Äôt want to take this lightly and am still aware that we‚Äôre not out of the woods yet. I want to do my part.

51,p2vbpu,1628755115,I‚Äôm (M20) very conflicted about how i‚Äôm feeling towards girl (F21) i‚Äôve seen for 2+ months,"
So this girl and i have been seeing each other for a while now, and she‚Äôs extremely sweet. She make me food and cookies, give me gifts and what not. She was also gone for a week and left me the Housekeys to use the apartment as i want. I‚Äôve also recently met her family and extended family. Idk what she introduced me as tho.

Lately we have been questioned A LOT while going to bars n stuff, if we‚Äôre together (by the bartender). Yesterday, she began laughing and crying and spitted her whole drink out, could barely breath. Quite extreme reaction when you just need to say no lol. Then she asked me multiple times later on ‚Äúwhat would you say if they asked you‚Äù and i would just tease her with ‚Äùher? I‚Äôm way out of her league‚Äù. That was funny in the moment but idk what sort of response she wanted, if she wanted me to ask her or something.

Anyway, i also know i‚Äôm the sort of guy that‚Äôs probably never in doubt. If i want to be with a girl i‚Äôd ask her to be my gf‚Ä¶.

So maybe what i‚Äôm asking is, when is weird to still be dating, while not being sure? I like her as a person, i like having sex with her as Well. But i dont see a future with her, she‚Äôs not wifey potential imo, more sort of a good College gf maybe. Idk, now i just Sound mean tbh.

53,p2voop,1628756991,Even Sonic Doesn‚Äôt Move This Fast,"TLDR; Married mother of 2 is divorcing after dating me for a few weeks.

So I‚Äôve met this woman almost 2 months ago. She‚Äôs new at work and a lot of things happened very quickly. 

Eventually, after fooling around for the first 2 weeks, we started dating. Right after we had sex she finally shared her secret; she‚Äôs married with 2 kids, 2 and 7.

The situation was kind of funny but also sad because the way she explained everything made me realize that the dude doesn‚Äôt even understand how of a terrible husband he is nor that things aren‚Äôt going well. He‚Äôs like her 3rd child. 

Just so we‚Äôre clear, he‚Äôs the one who ruined everything and I made myself clear to her that I can‚Äôt promise her we‚Äôd be together forever. It‚Äôs also obvious that she would be better alone since she has to pay for everything and takes care of everything. She won‚Äôt get a return of 1:1 since she always paid the house and he gets 50% and also his parents gave them the down payment in exchange for equity so really the sooner she leaves the better. She‚Äôs literally in a sunk cost fallacy situation. It‚Äôs better for her financially, mentally and for her happiness to leave him whether I‚Äôm in the picture or not, she‚Äôs miserable.

So we‚Äôve been dating for a few weeks and I‚Äôve met her kids. Somehow they love me just because I enjoy gaming lol. 

This is my first time dating a married woman so obviously all I know comes from movies but usually the cheater never divorces even when it makes sense and she‚Äôs a very nice person which is the only reason why she let that leech take everything from her for a decade but also why she never left him. Well, she fucking did it. Of course, since he truly is a complete doofus he didn‚Äôt understand the first time and pretended like she didn‚Äôt just told him that it was over. He tried cuddling with her even though she had pushed him away for weeks already and also tried to kiss her so she just repeated herself the next day (yesterday) and now apparently the vibe is tense at home.

I‚Äôm seeing her today and I guess we‚Äôre going to talk about it. She‚Äôs already looking at places even though her house might not sell that quickly. I wonder how they‚Äôre going to make it work for the upcoming months. As I said earlier, she pays for everything and it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs an irresponsible and immature idiot that pays his debts 1k per months and spends the rest on his car and weed. She has to feed him. He‚Äôll most likely have to move back to his crazy antivax mom‚Äôs for now. 

Despite how logical it all is, I feel some pressure from the situation. Almost like I married her. It‚Äôs only been weeks. What if I don‚Äôt like her anymore when the divorce is finalized? Even though she doesn‚Äôt drive, she‚Äôs making sure the places she looking up have a garage for me. She really includes me in all her important decisions and seem to think that we‚Äôre going to move in together. It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs been frustrated for so long that she lost her mind.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p2voop/even_sonic_doesnt_move_this_fast/
54,p2vvyp,1628758056,How to tell a girl gently to f*** off,"So I (24M) met this girl (22F) in class a few months ago, we started talking (as friends) and we really hit it off, I started to like her more but I knew that she has a bf (from 3 years) so I wouldn't do anything, she led me on to share my feelings with her and she reciprocated them, thanking me because as she said it would ""clear the air between us""  (So hinting that she wasn't gonna do anything about it).

Ofcourse I was badly hurt because the feelings I had for her were genuine and I never experienced them before, she kept telling me that I was her best friend and I just couldn't stand this (and nicknaming and teasing me which she knew that I liked), My mistake was that I should've cut ties with her from the beginning in order to avoid the heart break, so eventually I told her that I wish no longer to speak to her because my feelings were very strong and I can never see her as a friend.

She was very hurt after this but I told her that if she really sees me a friend she would accept it, seeing how bad she felt afterwards I told her I'll check up on you after a while (because she made me feel bad about me cutting the ties), and she told me that'll she be here waiting for years if I wanna talk.

I went through the recovery period (post heart-break) for about 5 weeks and I started working on myself feeling better (though not fully recovered), so I said I'll check up on her just casually, and since then, the conversation never stopped, she always keeps texting me, asking me questions, just saying random stuff, telling me that she's happy we're talking again, telling me that she was depressed for not seeing me all through summer, and all that kind of stuff, when I don't respond quickly or just try to ghost her, she sends multiple messages and sends messages on other platforms to tell me to go respond to her. 

I'm afraid that her behavior is leading me down a slippery slope, it's interfering with my recovery as though I'm thinking about her more and this will eventually prolong the heart break and end up hurting me even more. How can I set some boundaries with her?

P.S. : 1- We never did anything, it was only platonic, I can't and I don't accept being with someone involved in a relationship. If you have any thoughts about the whole situation please just share them as it will help give me clarity.

2 - She never talks about her bf with me, if you're someone's best friend don't you mention your bf to him?

I was fully aware of that, and want a second chance.
So i did my best and all, after i found out she had a casual date.
I was done i didnt want anything to do with her.
I realized she moved on.
So did i, i had a lot of feelings so i just deleted her.
After a few days i told her on facebook or something i have a few shirts of you let me bring it.
I did we didnt connect nothing.
And the next day she told me can we meet just for 1 time again
I wasnt shure if i should come.
But i did and i meet her, she told me how she was in love with me and if we could try it again.
The day before i saw her returing her stuff and my head was already spinning.
Now she droped the bom on me if i wanted to go on a holiday with her as i did.
We want for a week on holiday, we liked it.
We both had to prove things or something like that.
We came back from the holliday and i saw her once or twice its been a few weeks now from the holliday.
Before a few days, she took a tattoo.
Me as a religious person i dont like no tats no nothing.
I didnt say nothing just she is doing such reckless stuff.
I dont know what to say of do.
She keeps me off the grid of everything.
Living her own life, but talking about moving together and stuff.
I dont know what i should do.
We didnt talk from the day she took her tat.
I understand that its her life and her body, but i didnt like it she didnt tell me a damn thing.
Or asked something just maybe my opinion.
She just dont care atleast that is the way it feels.

58,p2we18,1628760602,Do I have the 'ick' because of my attachment style / dating history / papa problems - or is he just not for me?,"  

Hi everyone - thanks for reading this, it‚Äôs a bit of a long one!  
 

I‚Äôm F soon to be 31. I‚Äôve been dating a guy for two months and this is my first serious, committed relationship in 8 years. Prior to this, my dating timeline has been filled with non-committed, confusing and somewhat irresponsible long term flings that have usually left me feeling depressed, hopeless and yearning after the chap quite simply because I can‚Äôt have them. I‚Äôve done lots of self reflection and psychoanalysis over the years and I fully understand why I try and pursue these chaps, mostly related to daddy issues or what I like to call ‚Äòpapa problems‚Äô and also related to not being subject to healthy, stable relationships within the family. I‚Äôm scared of commitment just as much as the guys I claim to fall for are.  
 

I met a guy earlier this year who is 36, has been married before, works hard and is initially was very charming and kind. I was a little shallow at first admittedly, thinking he wasn‚Äôt funny, not my usual ‚Äòtype‚Äô (as in not as dangerously good looking as some of the men I have tried to convince to commit to me prior - always tricky if someone is ‚Äòtoo‚Äô good looking) but we started dating after getting on well at a mutual friends bbq and things moved pretty quickly. I got on well with him, he bought me flowers and text me all day, and calls morning, lunchtime and after work.  
 

I started to feel really claustrophobic and overwhelmed after a couple of weeks, I became emotional about this and for the first time in my life, openly spoke to him about it. He was patient and understanding and told me he was happy to slow things down, and that he wasn‚Äôt going anywhere.  
 

I picked apart my feelings and put them down to not being used to this sort of attention and assertiveness. I had a strong word with myself - I didn‚Äôt want to run away just because I had found something genuine and ‚Äònice.‚Äô  
 

Things didn't really change though, communication was still pretty intense and we spent lots of time together. I did feel that on the nights I wasn't with him, texts would be more and he was always quite inquisitive about what I was up to. If I was with friends, he'd say 'say hello to them from me.' Again, rather than reading into this too much - I told myself this was because he was genuinely interested in what I was up to, and he never failed to tell me he missed me on the nights we spent apart.

I went away for two weeks and as they say - distance makes the heart grow fonder. We FaceTimed every day. He said he missed me and although very early on, I began telling friends and family how well it was going.  
 

There‚Äôs an additional pressure in this respect as friends and family have seen me spiral into deep states of depression when I get my heart broken by another non-commitee. They want to believe and trust in the fact (as much  as I do) that I have finally found the ‚Äòreal deal.‚Äô  
 

After my trip, he came to stay with me at a friends house and I started to felt strange again. I also didn‚Äôt feel like being intimate with him on the second or third night. I felt guilty as it couldn‚Äôt have been nice for him either but I have a low sex drive at the best of times (possibly meds related) but also because we were in a friends home on a blow up mattress. The next morning he seemed angry and snapped slightly and became very moody. I apologised and explained more the reasons which seemed to bring us closer.  
 

On our drive back to our home town that day, he told me he was in love with me. I felt uncomfortable with this as we‚Äôd been dating for a month and two of those weeks I was away but paradoxically I also felt goosebumps and content that someone had fallen for me. When I got home - I felt confused and in limbo, I wasn‚Äôt sure how or what to feel and wished it could be simple.  
 

We went camping the following week and it was great. It was fun and easy and we were more intimate than the preceding weeks - I felt I was starting to fall for him. We laughed a lot, the sun was shining and I can't tell you what we talked about all that time, bit it felt very easy.  
 

Seven weeks later, one of my best friends is getting married and asked if I wanted to bring him. He has at this stage met many of my friends and family and so came along - it was the first time we drunk quite heavily together and so both felt the after effects in the morning. He‚Äôd also done some cocaine at the wedding which I thought was a little off, I don‚Äôt judge people take drugs but he lied about it and I had told him that the bride to be had hoped people wouldn‚Äôt bring them any of our friends do partake recreation-ally, so again I‚Äôd like to stress non judgement but I didn‚Äôt understand the fib.)  
 

In the evening, the small tent and the sell of alcoholic breath made me feel agitated, overwhelmed and claustrophobic. My mind didn't settle in to sleep, so in the morning I was quiet, over think-y and feeling low. I asked how we were getting home - he sarcastically replied 'I'll look into my crystal ball shall I,' and although I am fully aware that a restless sleep and a wine induced hangover made me take this to heart more than it would have done before - I felt shut down and stupid. I lent over to give him a jokey 'nipple cripple' (again upon reflection, not the best move on somone feeling the after affects of the night before and he snapped at me. He shoved my hand away at something that on a normal morning would have been playful and innocent.  It deteriorated from there, I shut down when people are angry or aggressive (and I use the word aggressive lightly as I must stress, I do not feel that he would be physically aggressive) but he was certainly mentally aggressive that morning. We disagreed some more (I am not someone that shouts, rather just gets quite emotional), he swore at me and told me to grow up. 

I‚Äôm quite a sensitive person as you may be able to tell, and any form of aggression, conflict, cursing or angry behaviour makes me panic and withdraw. I left the room and was stood outside with my brother. He came over after and put his hand on my head and asked ‚Äòhow‚Äôs your head?‚Äô  
 

I shrugged him off as I didnt want to be touched and felt strange that he was being so nice after how he had just been. I told him I didn‚Äôt have a headache to which he snapped again. This time in front of my friend and brother. ‚ÄòI‚Äôll leave you alone as you‚Äôre in a f\*cking shitty mood.‚Äô He stormed off, thunder faced.  
 

My brother said to me ‚Äòthat was pretty gross‚Äô and I tried hard not to sob. On the way home there was more shouting, something about not wanting to deal with playground behaviour, I was told to grow up. I‚Äôm really bad at articulating when I am upset and I shut down, I can‚Äôt remember much of what i said but I want to ask advice on whether I am over reacting here.  
 

This is where I need your help. Perhaps he snapped because I am not giving him what he wants, and he is frustrated I‚Äôm not instigating intimacy. I don‚Äôt know if I am pushing him away for all the wrong reasons or whether there is something I am picking up on that doesn‚Äôt feel right.  
 

I want to give some more context here.  
 

Many of the guys I have dated in the past have emotional issues and usually mask their mental challenges by smoking weed. He smokes weed and I don‚Äôt and I‚Äôd never try to change anyone but have him down as a ‚Äòfunctional stoner.‚Äô However, that being said - when we stayed with a friend he was desperate to source weed, so we had to sort that out for him. The weekend we were staying with my friend he had ran out of cash, so I paid for our meals out but yet he did give enough to get stoned.  
 

He used to be in the army and he said this helped his ‚Äòtemper,‚Äô and ‚Äòanger issues‚Äô but there have been a couple of times (wedding weekend included) where I‚Äôve seen this and felt threatened by this.  
 

His previous marriage ended because he was cheated on by his wife, he told me a story once about how his ex wives brothers were out to get him because she had claimed he used to ‚Äòbeat her about.‚Äô  
 

I am so confused at the moment and I am not sure whether I am clutching at things because stability is foreign to me. Because I want to flee not fight, because all the uncertainty is so overwhelming, the easier route is to just get out.  
 

Last night I bought us a meal to try and make amends and forget about it all - I paid for this (again, not all about money) but I feel like I ended up being more sorry for him because he told me that things aren‚Äôt going to be perfect all the time, couples fight and make up. But I feel like he is treating me as though I‚Äôve never had a relationship before and I am naive to what they are all about.  
 

I didn‚Äôt want to kiss him yesterday or this morning, I did - but it didn‚Äôt feel right. He told me he was horny and that I didn‚Äôt care.  
 

We had a couple of days apart and last night I met with him again. I wanted so desperately to see his face and feel positive feelings, but I didn't. I tried to explain everything to him as calmly and clearly as I could and he went through fleeting stages of being pissed off saying 'why invite me to your friends wedding,' 'this is crazy, you are doing this just because of Sunday,' 'you will regret not trying to make this work,' almost telling me how I should be feeling. When I became upset he was more empathetic,' I want to help you through the ups and downs,' but then told me to leave the car because he was being made out to be a monster.

&amp;#x200B;

It isn't a cop out - but I struggle mentally, and this seems to be mentally draining me. I want to work more on myself to understand this struggle but I am not sure if I am doing the right thing by forcing something that I am not sure is there. It was there, believe me, it was genuinely there. I was looking at his face the other night, feeling like I was falling for him, but now I feel intimated, like I am being subconciously controlled to be with someone because he thinks it is right. I am not sure I do.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is greatly received.

59,p2whxq,1628761210,"Why ""changing who you are"" is the best choice if you want to have a successful love life! (The pillars of developing your self-esteem)","Have you ever thought ""I am not going to change myself, I want to be loved for who I really am""?

Do you often struggle thinking ""why I always end up with women I don't really deserve""?

Have you ever thought ""I don't want to settle down anymore, but I want the best relationship with a woman I truly deserve""?


Well, I was in that same situation some years ago, and in this post, I am going to share my journey from being lonely, needy and depressed, to having a successful dating life and helping people do the same! I hope you'll be inspired by my short story 

The starting point!

Of course, I wasn't always this dating coach who showed people how to date and have more confidence in themselves. But originally I was someone who felt lonely most of the time, I was getting older and I had no real relationships yet and of course, I was the classic nice guy who couldn‚Äôt even get on a second date. I was thinking ""why dating is so hard??"", ""I have so much to give and no-one wants to be in a relationship with me"". I was watching everybody around me having great relationships and I was getting more and more frustrated.

Soon enough, I realized what was holding me back: I had the FEAR of getting rejected. I wasn't able to accept myself for who I am and I didn't want to change. I didn't want to LOSE important WORK TIME, but soon enough I realized that this was just an EXCUSE of giving up on the dating game because I wasn't feeling good enough.

Taking Action!

I had to take action. As Albert Einstein said, doing the same thing over and over again is the definition of insanity. The first step was to understand who I am, by living consciously in every social interaction I had, without judgment of what is good or bad. This is the first pillar of developing your self-esteem:¬†THE PRACTICE OF LIVING CONSCIOUSLY

The second step was to accept myself for who I am, with all the pros and cons of my character. This is the second pillar of developing your self-esteem:¬†THE PRACTICE OF SELF ACCEPTANCE.

The third, and maybe the most important step, was to take REAL ACTION. It's quite easy to just wait for miracles to happen. I took myself seriously and I've changed what I did not like in myself anymore. I wanted to grow and the only way to do it is to ""CHANGE WHO YOU ARE"".

But please, do NOT misunderstand me: The phrase ""changing who you are"" means BECOMING THE BEST VERSION OF YOURSELF. Life always invites you to grow! I changed my style and my haircut, I practiced my social skills and my body language, and of course, I got rejected hundreds of times by girls. I received help from mentors and I was able to approach on the street, in bars, and in my daily life. That made me grow. These are the third&amp;fourth pillars of developing your self-esteem:¬†THE PRACTICE OF SELF RESPONSIBILITY &amp; THE PRACTICE OF SELF-CONFIDENCE.No more excuses, take action.

Reaping the fruits of my labor!

I had great experiences with women (not bragging, sex is something natural like eating) and I also made some relationships on the way. But again something was missing. I caught myself getting into relationships just for the sake of having someone by my side. That's exactly what 90% of men do. They settle down for the second-best option, even if they want a more beautiful woman or someone who understands their busy schedule, respects and supports them.

I was that guy, but I moved on. I wrote down my goals and dreams in life and the kind of woman I truly deserve, in detail. I had a clear picture of what I wanted and I wasn't going to settle down for the second-best option again. This is the fifth pillar of developing your self-esteem:¬†THE PRACTICE OF LIVING PURPOSEFULLY.

Lastly, I had to make few more changes in my situation. I had to put into practice my goals and dreams, either personal or professional. ""I do, exactly as I say"". This is the last pillar of developing your self-esteem:¬†THE PRACTICE OF PERSONAL INTEGRITY.

Now I have my dream partner by my side and I am truly fulfilled, happy and abundant when I share my everyday life with her.

The purpose!

After understanding how to have an abundant and fulfilled dating life, I chose to help other guys who are in the same situation I was, some years ago. Through my journey, I understood that helping people is my purpose in life. I am not the classic PUA guy who will help you seduce women. I hate that. I am helping people have great experiences, understand what women truly deserve, and eventually find their dream partner.

60,p2wib1,1628761265,"Women and the ""Art of Playing Hard To Get"". Needs to stop......","You can't really get a boyfriend or a date if you really think you can reply to their messages after 2-3 days of them texting you. I understand that you have your own career, I'm not taking your careers into consideration here, obviously when it's your professional life it's obviously very hard to reply or have a conversation.

But dating is a very emotionally expensive thing for Men, especially. I'd say majority of the Men go through this when it comes to dating. And almost all the time, Women are taught to be ""very hard to get"".

The question is, can you do it for an eternity? Obviously there's an end for that isn't it? A lot of guys give up on dating when Women ignore a Guy intentionally. Like do y'all think it's going to make him chase you more? Don't you think we don't have a life? A lot of Guys literally give a part of their time for this, yet you think it's ok to ignore him intentionally?

Especially Women give this advice to other Women saying: ""Ignore him a bit more, that'll make him chase you more"", some shit like that, I just hate to be a shallow person but you'll be the one at loss when he leaves you and finds another person. You can't do this shit when you're fucking 35+ that age of ignoring and playing games in a relationship fucking ends in your 20's lmao.

61,p2wjzn,1628761508,Feel like my childhood hurts my date life (M 20),"So I had a pretty rough time growing up. My mother passed away when I was young and my father was either negligent or absent. I had some major self esteem issues that made me turn towards drug and alcohol abuse. I still struggle with drinking (it is much better though) but I no longer use drugs. 

I managed to get to college, and I‚Äôm doing surprisingly well. My grades are good, I‚Äôve made multiple friends, and I  even had a somewhat long term relationship (my first one!) since that ended though, I‚Äôve had a hard time finding another one, and even that one was unhealthy.

I‚Äôve been told by one of my friends that‚Äôs a girl that I can come off as intimidating because I‚Äôm confident and sort of quiet, she said it also had something to do with the fact that I‚Äôm a ‚Äúgrown man‚Äù, which I thought was desirable. I honestly don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm that scary of a guy once you get to know me (this girl has also described me as ‚Äúadorable‚Äù, so that‚Äôs a dub I guess).

Nevertheless, whenever I try to talk to girls my age I can have a hard time relating to them. My ex had an amazing family, and when I met them I felt really anxious, like I didn‚Äôt belong or something. I get a similar feeling when I talk to girls now. I feel like my past before college keeps me from having really any common ground with a lot of women.

But today she dropped a bomb by telling me she wants to date other people.
I mean she only does what we‚Äôve agreed upon but now that she does it, I am afraid of losing her, like lose her completely. I opened up to her about a couple of things, emotional stuff.
I always got along with her, had a great time but there are some things which are keeping me from taking the risk of the relationship, as I said.
Her dating other guys is fair and I told her that, because I don‚Äôt want to waste her time. I feel kinda hurt because I am afraid of that day she says: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a bf now, we can‚Äôt stay in contact because of our sexual past‚Äù 
But at the same time I am almost sure that I don‚Äôt l want her as my gf.

I don‚Äôt now how to feel about that. I would be happy if she finds someone but I am also afraid that she vanishes out of my life for good.

75,p2zejh,1628773410,I‚Äôm so far behind in life,"I (23F) went out to dinner with my girlfriends (early-mid 20s F) recently, and it made me so incredibly depressed. All are in happy healthy long term relationships. I realized how far behind I am in life. One friend recently moved in with her boyfriend and everyone was asking her about it. Everyone started talking about their plans to move in with their boyfriends. About how happy they were and all the cute stuff their boyfriends did. I just sat there, and scrolled through stuff on my phone because I had absolutely nothing to contribute to the conversation. 

A few months ago I was one of them, but my ex bf (23M) of 6 months dumped me. I was blindsided, I was so happy and in love with him, and I thought it was a great relationship. He told me I did nothing wrong but that he just ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt as invested‚Äù as he should be, and wasn‚Äôt falling in love with me. I had no idea. I asked him to reconsider and offered to work on things, but he said there was nothing to work on, and never contacted me again, even to say happy birthday. I was so happy with him and tried to be the best girlfriend. I always made fun plans, listened to his complaints or stories about work and his roommates, never minded if he wanted a night with the boys, spent hours picking the best birthday and Christmas gifts for him, never argued, just did random nice things. But it wasn‚Äôt enough. And like he said, there‚Äôs not anything I did wrong, apparently I‚Äôm just inherently unlovable. There‚Äôs nothing to fix. It‚Äôs just who I am.

My ex contacted me to tell me that he would never be in a relationship with me again (bc I am just that bad apparently), but wanted to hook up with me. I agreed to hookup but afterwards realized it was a mistake. When I told him it made me really sad because I missed our relationship he didn‚Äôt respond. This is the same guy who was so excited when we started dating, and now he couldn‚Äôt care less about me. 

After a barrage of mediocre online dates. After trying so hard to be a good girlfriend and getting rejected again. I think some people just aren‚Äôt meant to be with someone, and I am slowly realizing I am one of them.

He is so creepy and awkward. I need to get out of here... even a guy seemingly asking you for the time or directions can somehow turn into him asking for your phone number.

Note that this is NOT the case when women meet women. Please, forget abut how that awful, toxic media portrays women relationships. Women actually love and admire each other. Why do you think any women's movements is so successful? On a ladies' night out, they go out in groups and got each other's back. There is a sense of union and sisterhood among them. Observe them, they genuinely enjoy each other's company.

Observe how women are with their female friends, they bond naturally and get along so well like you'd think they are in a relationship except without the sex component. Yes, whenever I see women socializing, I cannot tell if they are they all are in a loving relationship because of the affection and cordiality they show to each other.

95,p30yht,1628778503,Offline vs Online,"Hey, it seems that guys should have a higher chance offline than in Tinder. 

Let me explain, as soon as a girl joins Tinder she is flooded with guys, and some of the guys are extremely attractive (I doubt that she will have a grasp of attention from them in real life). As a result, girls are extremely selective, as they don't experience any cost with swiping left. Meanwhile, in real life, no one likes to reject somebody. Additionally, girls in real life are quite shy and they are approached less frequently (unlike tinder bombardment). 

To sum up, the behaviour of girls online is different to their behaviour offline. Average and above-average guys should have a lot more leverage offline. 

Could someone please share their experience with me? And do you agree?

You should have a much better outcome with girls in real life if you just try to pay attention or indicate that you like them. 

For example, you had liked a barista and you had a small chitchat with her (how are you? do you like your job? are studying? ), said a couple of compliments like: 'i like the way you tie your hair' or 'i like you nails' and so on. She will recognise you and you can just leave your phone number on a receipt. 

Congratulations, you had approached her and you did it in a non-embarrassing manner. She will have a choice to call or not, but at the same time, you had to approach her in a nice non-threatening environment. If you approach 10 girls in the same way, there will be a chance that one or two will call you. Also, I think the attractiveness of a barista will be higher than your average tinder match.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p30yht/offline_vs_online/

He's responsible, intelligent, clever, interesting, and when we initially started talking things really seemed to line up in a way they haven't with others (communication, effort, honesty, respect/consideration, committed to goals, and shared values).

As time's gone on though I've come to realize he doesn't meet the standards I've set for myself. We don't share a similar lifestyle (he's 28 and spends nearly every weekend getting drunk going out with friends or weekdays he'll go out drinking and consistently tells me ""I didn't even realize or intend to get so drunk"" which is ???).

Our goals don't really line up and getting together would be overcomplicated. We don't even have an easy time talking to one another - he wears me out sometimes. Additionally, some of the things he says are jarring and off putting to me (generalizing people, can be super caustic and visceral in some of his remarks). He also makes fun of my dad for being ignorant (differing political views) and has shared some outlandish stories with me about parties he's gone to or wild nights out and how he's treated/spoken to other people. He frames it as funny, but I can't imagine how mortifying it was for the workers/individuals he was interacting with.

Things are tapering off now. I can sense it, and I don't really want to fight it because I just don't think it's a right fit.

So, we've been seeing each other only when I came to visit but texted/video-chatted for almost a year. Last time I came back in March I asked if we can end the FWB as I was not feeling comfortable in the situation and long-distance is not an option. I also proposed to remain friends/keep the contact but not so often (as I wasn't sure of his response I though of it as a nice way to end things, tbh). He agreed that he didn't like the relationship lately as well, and fast forward 1 month after this conversation he texted me again and we have been texting once a week briefly for the last 4 months until I came back from abroad.

Last time he sent me lovely message was 3 weeks ago, and while now I am now back in my country and texted him asking how's life and that I decided to return from abroad. I also asked him for a small advice just to keep the conversation going (advice on how to train for a specific race in a month). He congratulated me with the return and sounded a bit nervous in the beginning of a voice memo he sent as a reply to the advice I asked. He also said that ""it looks like he also has a new life stage and began dating some girl 2 weeks ago"", but simultaneously offered to train me for the race I'm preparing for the next 5 weeks (create training plan, give advice etc). I replied that relationship is a smart decision of him and agreed to be trained. I now send him the summary of my every training 4 times per week (as he asked to do it), but unsure of his reasoning for this whole training thing.

From my side, I would like to meet with him just to see how he is doing, but don't want it to be romantic/intervene with his brand new relationship.
