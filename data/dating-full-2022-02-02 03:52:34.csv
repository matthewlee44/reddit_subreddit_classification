So on the second day, after the proposal, the girl who has one of the beds to herself offers to let me sleep in it about 3 times during the day. I took the offer and said we could have a divider of pillows between us, but she declined and said it was fine. Slept like shit, but we were pretty much shoulder to shoulder with like 3 inches of space between us the whole night with just some random non cuddling limb interaction (hot!), normal sleeping stuff.

We meet up at downtown Palm Springs at this smoothie place. Her eye really is messed up, she wasn't lying about that. She's very cute.

I'm 33 and she's 26. She's definitely eccentric personality wise...kind of in her own little world in a way. Definitely a different kind of person. Our conversation flows...okay.

I greeted her with a hug. I held hands with her for a bit. Downtown Palm Springs was packed. And we bounced around from place to place. It was hectic.

I awkwardly kissed her head goodbye when hugging her goodbye. I said ""I want to see you again. If you don't it's totally okay."" She said for me to text her.

When texted me first. She asked if I got home okay, and then asked me if I was nervous. ""Did I scare you? You seemed to frightened.""

There's this girl I really like. She's the daughter of a family friend. Very beautiful. She's 15 years old and I'm 16 years old. I live in California, and she lives in Massachusetts. She lives with her father while her mother lives in the same city and neighborhood as me, here in Cali. Her parents are divorced and not on good terms at all. Her mother has the legal rights to her older brother (same age as me), and she is now married and has a child with her new husband. My family used to own a daycare and we'll watch the mother's new daughter, (who just turned 8 years old on Saturday). That's how I met this girl. I met her through her little sister and family when she came to Cali visit back in 2019.

On Saturday, I went to her little sister's birthday party. Obviously, this girl can't attend the party   
 because she lives on the other side of the country. Anyways, she snapped me a selfie of her that afternoon and followed up with a picture of the snow outside of her house. And talked about how it's snowing heavily where she's at. I replied back to her snap with a text. She never bothered to even open it. No big deal. As the day went on, she posted a story saying, ""happy birthday little sister"".  I also posted a story with me and her little sister taking a selfie and I also put happy birthday and posted other pictures from the party on my snap. When I saw her happy birthday story post, I replied back saying ""aww, that's sweet."" but she never even opened my text. I noticed she viewed all of my stories that same day during the party. The next day, I decided to send her another text, she never even bothers to open it. Yet, she kept viewing my stories on Sunday. I mean, she'll watch every single one that I posted. The next day, Monday, I posted more stories, yet there she is again, viewing my stories. 

It's Tuesday now, and she never replied to any of my text or even got back to me. I don't understand why she is even acting like this all of sudden when she was snapping me back on Saturday at noon. I know I didn't do anything wrong or bad to her. Is this a weird tactic that girls play? 

Some people called this orbiting or haunting. But I really do not understand why she's giving me the cold shoulder all of sudden. I did nothing wrong at all. I really like her, yeah, she lives far away from me, but I just don't wanna lose our friendship over this. And she was active on snapchat today. I'm just very confused.

We spent a bit more time together doing stuff, and all seemed well. Kept talking, kinda flirting, asked her on a couple more dates (using the word) and she said yes to all of them.

Recently I thought it'd be fun to have a cooking date together, so I've been asking her about it. She's gotten pretty busy this upcoming week, so she's had trouble finding space in her schedule for it but tonight we talked about it and tried to schedule it for this weekend. 

As we talked about it I figured it'd be a good time to communicate and ask her about how she is feeling with this stuff. I told her I enjoyed spending this time with her and that I liked her.

She then said 'Oh, sorry but I'm not interested. I have my mind somewhere else right now, but I've enjoyed hanging out with you as a friend'.

So basically I (23F) asked my friend out (31M) via text and he responded saying he feels the same and he likes me too. But then he added there were a few things because of which he was putting his foot back ,so let's go for lunch and discuss that.

Ofcourse I was really curious about what those things were because of which he was putting his foot back. I was thinking it must be the age gap, the fact that he just started his own patisserie a year back and also that we both come from different cultures . ( We are from India ,and specifically I am from the south part of India and he is from the north part. So in our country love marriages are still not a very common thing and there are many hurdles when you want to marry someone who is from another culture, relegion or caste . )

Anyhow,the next day he got free early in the evening and he asked me if i wanted to go for a walk and we went for a walk that lasted two hours.

So as I had thought , some of the reasons he was keeping his foot back was one due to our age gap and the culture thing. 

But the biggest reason was he still has feelings for his ex. He told me that he does like me and he wishes he could be with me but right now he won't be able to commit to me fully because of his feelings for his ex and it would be better if we stay friends.

I was wondering how you’d go about this situation if you were in my shoes. 

Growing up I have success picking up girls. At school I hooked up with a handful of 8s 9s and a 10. 

The 10 in particular I’m planning on seeing and catching up with. I messaged her to catch up + see each other, next time she was in town. 

I’m 25 and she’s a 1/2 years older for context. 

She lives in LA + works in that Hollywood scene with hair salons. I live in the NorthEast. 

Right or wrong, I believe in the saying that men fall in love with their eyes. She’s so so so pretty and excuse my language but we made great love but nothing longterm in it.. 

I’m going to grad school soon + focused on myself, but I want to see if she’d ever want more. I’m confident in myself, but I’m struggling to settle down. 

I have successful young girls with careers and graduate degrees throwing choosing signals, but most are like 7/7.5s. 

The 10 is the one that people say could be once in a lifetime unless you’re an athlete or artist etc.

B should be out pursuing a woman who will be able to give him the type of family he wants one day, and out of respect for his time I have to call it quits.

I would appreciate advice on how to have that conversation with B.

So story time: I recently moved to a new city. Prior to officially moving, I went on a month+ long vacation to visit my family in South America for the holiday season. While I was there, I was super bored and decided to use the Passport Tinder feature because I was curious to see the people in my new city. I put in my bio I was new and would be back next month and was looking for mostly friends (in all caps) and then dates/romance (I’m queer btw). I wasn’t expecting anything at all and was just curious to see who was out here. 

Well I end up matching with this super cute and cool guy and he messages me. I wasn’t expecting anything out of that initially either because I never message/text people on there for too long or tend to have super complex conversations with matches on there either. We strike up a conversation, he knows I’m not coming back for 5-6 weeks, and we somehow keep talking … (he gives me his number and Instagram). We end up texting almost every single day for the month of December and early January, getting to know each other, flirting a looot, sending each other voice notes, videos, and selfies, and talking about how we are gonna hang when I come back and he’s gonna show me around. A couple times it gets kind of hot, not full on sexting or anything but talking about how we’ve been thinking about each other sexually and are really ready to meet. And i say, I hope you still wanna hang out with me in three weeks and he says, duh of course. We keep talking the next couple weeks, some days more than others, about random things, but always at least some flirting. 

This is all kind of wild and unexpected to me cuz I never ever text anyone everyday without being annoyed and we’re finding we have stuff in common and get along well and etc. Toward the end of my trip, we end up Facetiming too and afterward he texts me that he was too shy to say it on FaceTime but that I’m so cute and he loves my smile and just wants to tell me in person. While I’m traveling and recovering from jet lag, we kind of stop texting so much and eventually I say something about getting to hang out and that I’ve honestly still been thinking about kissing him and he says, “oh wow 😳 well i’m just going with the flow as usual with whatever happens :) i’m excited to meet though, it has felt like years” and i was kinda like, ok… but said, “for sure for sure, lol same,” trying to be chill. I think I don’t end up replying to his last message to me. 

Well, I finally get to the new city and he knows, also via my IG story. He doesn’t reach out so after a few days I do. He says he would love to hang and that’s he’s gonna be in my area on this day and yeah. He says, how about we make plans to go to this city lake area, go to the grocery store for snacks, and then go to a bar later. When we meet up he says, he’s gonna skip the bar today because he has work in the morning and the train back to his house has been running really unreliably at night. We go to the store, have a picnic, and have good conversations and jokes. It feels pretty natural but we don’t flirt at all. It’s friendly. I give him a small gift of a specific alcohol that I talked to him about while I was in my country and he was really happy. We watch the sunset and it gets dark and we end up saying good ye and thanks for hanging out. 

He texts me a couple hours later saying thanks for hanging out, it was so great to meet in person. That he hopes I get home safe and have a great night and thank you again for the gift, that he really really appreciated it. I text back, same to you, thank you, and to let me know how he ends up liking it. He doesn’t end up texting back ever or asking to hang out again or anything and that was almost two weeks ago.

 I’m confused cuz now I don’t know how he feels about me. I feel like — If he’s seeing someone else, why he would he say he’s excited to meet me and ask to go on a picnic at sunset? If I didn’t like someone anymore but felt forced to meet them, I would pick something more boring. If he just doesn’t like me, why wouldn’t he just say he sees me more as a friend and clarify that? And then, I’m like, is he just shy? I just feel like if a guy wants to hang out with you, he’ll ask you right? Especially since I pretty much reached out first when I got here and he knows I’m new here. It just feels dumb because why spend so much time texting me for nothing (it’s not he ever asked for nudes or sexting stuff ever) and be romantic and say you have a crush and make plans to show me around and then do nothing once we meet?

I am wondering if I should continue to pursue this woman. I've know her about 3 mo. We've hung out about 4 times and they were all amazing, 6+ hours; the third time we ended up sleeping with each other. She doesn't shy away when I kiss her. There is a lot of physical contact, and a great amount of  ""down to earth"" comfort when we are together--like the type of comfort you have with a really good friend or a partner you've been with for a while.

The thing is that when we are apart she never contacts me 1st and takes a while to respond. She eventually does, but I feel like I'm bothering her because she doesn't reach out first and takes a while to respond. (Sometimes she does respond fast though and we'll have a quick, light convo). I haven't asked her if she's interested because I don't know how, and don't feel the need to when we are together because things go so well. We started out as just friends. I had no intention of us doing anything. 

Are things just moving slow, or is the lack of contact and effort when we are away on her part indicate a lack of interest or a sign that she is keeping me at bay because she isn't interested in the way that I am? I don't want to get to serious fast either she's still young and so am I. But I would like to know if there's potential there like if what we are doing could develop into more. Just feel like asking her would seem out of the blue since the dynamic has been like this since I met her...besides the cuddling, sleeping together, etc. Perhaps, I'm just being jumpy wanting things to move faster?

We click really well and they are great people who I have a lot in common with. Unfortunately when he begins showing interest in me beyond friendship, something in my mind switches and I start noticing all the flaws in this guy, with many of the flaws being tied to his appearance.

Even though I don’t intend on getting physical with someone until I trust them and know them better as a romantic partner, my mind immediately jumps to “Would I be okay being intimate with this guy?” Always the answer in “no” and in fact, the idea of being intimate with this person ends up disgusting me. These men would probably be below average at best when considering conventional attractive traits, but I’m of the idea that attraction can grow with a relationship. 

I try to suppress my issue with their “looks” because their personalities are great, but it always gets to a point where I can’t get over how I feel absolutely no attraction to this person. Sometimes I get romantic interests, but everything disappears when sex comes into the conversation. 

I feel shallow because usually looks are the breaking point and they fade overtime anyway, so why should they matter to this extent? I also can’t tell if I’m on the asexual spectrum, but I’m thinking not since I can imagine sex with some guys on occasion (but never the ones I’m dating). Simultaneously, I’m not sure if I’m using appearance as a scape goat to cover something like an underlying fear of intimacy or the one-time scenarios where these guys didn’t respect a boundary. 

In any case, has anyone been in a relationship where they weren’t attracted at all to their SO? If you’re still in it, how did you make it work out?

At the moment, I am working on finishing up college before beginning to study for law school, searching for internships, and looking into getting into modeling, as I have been encouraged to do it before. In my free time, when I am not concentrating on schoolwork, I enjoy writing, hiking, photography, dabbling in investing, biking, and traveling.

I wish girls liked me enough to commit.

there’s a girl I used to work with and I used to take her home at night and we would chill after work at night before I took her home we would sit in the car and talk or go eat. Overtime I started developing a crush on her and everyone at work kept asking me if we were dating but we weren’t. One day she quit and I was sad but it was whatever I hit her up a couple months later and started asking if she wanted to hang out she was ok with it but then asked me if it was because I liked her and I took this as a chance to finally just let it out and admit that I liked her so I said yes and well she told me she doesn’t see me that way and she has a boyfriend so her boyfriend wouldn’t want her hanging out with a guy who likes her so I just said my bad didn’t know you had a boyfriend its cool and kept it at that we never texted each other after that. 

Present Day 
It’s been like 5 1/2 months since that happened
and I’ve been cool stopped thinking about her and basically moved on thinking I would never hear from her again and I was fine with that I thought maybe it just wasn’t to be. She texted me out the blue one night around 2am asking me how I’ve been and how she hasn’t spoken to me in forever. . I’m not going to lie I texted back and we’ve been texting each other for a couple of days but normal conversation and making jokes like nothing happened before like I didn’t just tell her i had a crush on her couple months ago and she said we can’t be. which is weird for me because I still feel like I kind of like her and it’s killing me because it gives me like a sense of hope that maybe she likes me but at the same time I feel like this is just pointless conversation and kind of mad that she texted me just when I was forgetting about her and now all my old feelings towards her is coming back. Idk what to do at this point because I just don’t see the reason why we should be texting anymore if I haven’t seen her in person for a long time and I really doubt we will see each other again in person because it wouldn’t be right her knowing I have feelings for her and I can’t do anything.

I walk to another aisle a couple aisles down basically hiding till she leaves, and about 30-40 seconds later, she walks to that aisle and looks down that aisle (where i was hiding) for a few seconds, presumably to look for something, then leaves. Then according to my manager, she left without buying anything and before she left, she was standing near the doors, and looking in the direction of the aisle i was hiding in, then left without buying anything.

This girl had a crush on me in school, and i was shy and ignored her. she’s currently engaged to the boyfriend she’s been with for 10 years and is set to marry him next Fall i think. Even in high school, when she was dating her current fiancé, she would constantly be trying to flirt with me or get my attention and her friends knew she had a thing for me because anytime she and her friends saw me, they would giggle or call out my name. In middle school she asked me out and i rejected. She looked sad or even angry when i was ignoring her in high school.

That is, until we hit a rough patch as his mental health wasn't doing the best and I tried to be as understanding and supportive as I could, even saying we could pick it up again once he had figured himself out. I thought I had successfully ended contact on good terms, until he shows up a week later saying how much he missed me, how much he likes me and claimed he was only being distant due to stressful factors (such as work) in his life. 

I let myself believe this, thinking he truly meant it when he said he likes me, and we decided to take things slower this time. Then yesterday he told me has feelings for his best friend (20F). The same best friend he had previously told me he had a crush on last summer, explaining how he had confessed already and was friendzoned so he had moved on since then (which all turned out to be a lie because yesterday he didn't recall having told me this early on to reassure me there was nothing between them).  
I know this isn't necessarily my fault, but I am feeling like shit. I feel responsible. I have all these questions in my head about my own self worth, whether or not I will ever find someone who genuinely likes me and means it, and the scariest of them all is the thought that I let myself believe someone was truly capable of liking me - because why would that ever be true? Did I deserve this? I gave him every opportunity to be honest with me, yet he chose to lie again and again.

I want to hear some opinions to get a grasp if I'm controlling or out of touch.

So my (28M) girlfriend (25F) is not that communicative and I would consider myself very talkative which is fine, it's just the way we are.

But what keeps bugging me out is that she doesn't tell me when e.g. her best friend is with her or she got plans with her mother when we are not spending time together.

Before you go apeshit: I'm not demanding that she tells me every single detail, that she asks for permission or that she has to tell me with whom or what she is doing.

I just would like to know it, when we are texting, so I know that she's busy and I don't need to write her and/or expect a quick response with her (because she's busy).

When im out with my best friend I always shoot her a text so she knows what im up to, that she knows that I'm busy and can't chat for hours and hours.
I'm not telling this to her so she can approve it, but just to keep her in the loop and I would expect the same from her.

Is this unreasonable? Is this controlling? We didn't discuss this yet and I'm not sure if I even should discuss this because she has this tendency to feel smothered but I think that I'm not asking much.

How is it some people can be best friends with someone else and be physically intimate with them (cuddling and being physically close, and in some cases have a sexual  connection/hookup/fwb) but still be friends and not in a relationship?

The person I'm discussing this with believes that this type of close physical intimate connection with someone is wrong because it's what happens in a relationship, and I explained how I believe there is no right or wrong answer, only what you can feel comfortable with. I believe that there is nothing wrong in having an intimate connection with someone as it doesn't necessarily become a relationship which in principal is how I understand fwbs work.

What are your opinions on this matter? 

For some extra background, this person is sitting on the fence right now and has vocally expressed interest in such a physical connection but says she thinks it's wrong and disloyal of her. I explained that there is no right or wrong answer but for her to follow her gut. She said if I could explain to her how a relationship differs from a friendship when being physical then it may help her make her mind up so I'm just seeing what are differences here.

To me, we live in a „me-first“ culture and it is very prevalent in dating. When I’m speaking of this I’m talking about how in every interaction, we think in the back of our minds that „if this doesn’t look like it’s instantly benefitting me, I’ll move on and find something/someone who will“.

Im not saying to deal with harmful behaviours in the name of trying to overcome obstacles in building a relationship, but it genuinely does seem like the vast majority of us give up so easily, myself included. We will throw around words like „red flags“, „gaslighting“, „toxic“, „lovebombing“, etc. when we have an issue as simple as miscommunication or lack of understanding. Of course these things exist and are not to be taken lightly, but if it seems like *everyone* is throwing these words around to describe what the other party did to them, maybe we need to think more about how we are using these terms.

And servers like these seem to throw gasoline on the Fire at times. The second something goes wrong the first thing someone will tell you is to leave and find someone else; Theres plenty of Fish in the sea. While this isn’t necessarily wrong or poor advice at times, it removes the chance of actual constructive dialogue and accountability.

We’ll speak about how we’re simply putting ourselves or our mental health first when we avoid confrontation and communication, but are we really or are we just going the easy route?

Before you judge me, here's a quick recap of events :-

1. Me and this friend which I did wanted to know more about were supposed to hang out. I never said it was a date and told her to bring friends along if she'd like. My buddy cancelled on me the last minute too so we ended up just going to grab lunch and have a quick chat. I quickly realized it was best to stay friends (this was during first year of university where you wanna be popular). That was the only time we went out like that and we stayed friends because we were working on a project. 


2. Met my current girlfriend a couple of weeks later and we've been together for the last 2 years. 


3. I've told my gf that I have went out with her friend, whom she actually met because i introduced them (now they're closer, I've kept my distance for obvious reasons) from the beginning.


4. So here's what happened that made us fight. I went to pass something to them one night, and I kept my distance from the friend. I found out she ended up saying to my girlfriend that I was being weird, should have gotten closer for a hug or something. Mind you, I'm naturally a conservative guy and we haven't even met in person for 2 years because of COVID. 

5. During their sleepover, she brought up the fact that I was going after her, and I asked her out on a date in one of their girl talks, in front of my girlfriend.


I have kept my limits with her even before this because my gf is more important. I don't hang around with her, don't casually talk. She's more of a hi-hello acquaintance. But still my gf thinks its my fault for giving her the opportunity to even say things like that. I told my gf I will put an end to this disrespect by talking with her friend directly, but she says she would leave me if i humiliated her that way. 

*note i have also sent screenshots to my girl showing my texts with her friend, and how I really wasn't going after her. I did admit to my girlfriend I was just into the hype of being a freshman and wanted to be popular, but when I met my gf she became everything to me.

All my past romantic situations have just happened - you know, meeting a person in real life, getting to know each other etc.

I downloaded a couple of apps and it makes me a bit overwhelmed already. I am a bit of a weirdo, I have some very specific passions in my life that I am working towards and I also happen to be a Christian. It's like in the other hand I'm the kind of artsy hippie type that does not necessarily get along with people who are not the same, but I also have some very conservative values by modern standards (that artsy hippie people often do not have) and I'm only looking for very serious, long term dating. So I think this makes it a bit awkward already. I'm not sure which side to highlight (or if I should avoid dating apps overall if I'm hesitant). I have tried to be as straightforward on my profile as I can.

I'm generally pretty shy and I have a fear of leading people on. So can you guys tell me a bit about how this stuff usually works, what is normal and acceptable etc? I don't really hold back with people I like (as in I feel like it's nice to chat with them), I find it easy to dive into conversations right away, I always reply to stuff being said to me and I generally try to please the person I'm talking to. Like I naturally tend to match their style of texting, react positively to whatever they say and so on. But is this the kind of behavior people on dating apps expect and want, or do they assume you're super nice to them only when you're 100% sure you're interested in them? Even if someone has ""looking for friends too"" or ""just wanting to connect"" on their profile, is it okay to talk to them even if you know you're not going to make a good couple romantically or is it better to skip them to not waste anyone's time? 

And what about when you talk to someone and it's going well, but you start to feel like they wouldn't be the right partner for you. Should you cut off the conversation or is it okay to talk about stuff even when you're not sure it would lead anywhere? Is it better to give it a try anyway or sort of like ""play it safe""? I also wonder is it sensible to match with a lot of people, or simply  stick to someone you already matched with and only keep looking when it dies out?

We finally met up on Sunday and it feels like it went  great. The conversation flowed non stop, there was a little witty  banter, and we never ran out of conversations to talk about. Around 1.5  hours in she said she needed to go, because she had an early morning ski  trip the next day. When the check came, she offered to pay, but I  insisted. Walked her to her car and she initiated a hug, told her to  text me when she got home. 15 minutes later she texts something like  ""thanks for the fun time, when you are free lmk if you want to do it  again"". I responded ""It was my pleasure, will do and have fun tomorrow"".

So  now it's Wednesday. Aside from one date related inside-joke text and  hearing about her ski trip, the last thing she sent was the dreaded ""how  is your week"". I don't blame her, seems like she wants to keep the  conversation going. But that gets stale fast and I can't see her again  until next weekend (two weeks after date 1).

Really liked her, got on well, found her interesting smart, kind etc.

She was struggling with a lot of stuff in her life recently, had someone close die, felt guilty about being so far from her family, considering moving back, work etc.

She said to me, after 4 months dating, that she wasn't emotionally ready for a relationship right now. She told me she liked me, if she was ready it would be with me, there was no one else, she doesn't want to lose me, but she is not ready right now and it is not fair to me.

I told her I understood and she had to do what is right for her.

After about 2 weeks, I casually checked in on her, she responds quickly and starts talking with me, in the end she says she misses me. I tell her that, if she ever wants to talk, she should text me.

A week later, she initiates a conversation with me, she is asking how I am and about an upcoming trip I told her about. At the end she asks me to go to dinner next week.

Day of the date, I ask if we are still on. Radio silence that day. Obviously date never happened.

Next day, I text her asking if something happened. She said she feels guilty about it, but she found out her dad had cancer that day and blocked all her messages. I tell her that I will move on if I need to. I said I understand she is going through a hard time right now, so don't worry about me.

I did end up telling her that I love her which is true, she said it means a lot to her, and that we can maybe be together if she stays where she is after she sorts this stuff out. I end it by saying I'll give her space.

I feel like I should probably try move on, because I don't think realistically she is going to come back to me, especially after getting ghosted. Problem is I do love her, so I'm kinda fooling myself into thinking it can happen. I feel like I'm just setting myself up for pain, but it is hard not to. I'm not really interested in seeing anyone else right now. I don't even know how much her choice to not see me is based out of circumstance or loss of interest (and not wanting to be blunt) realistically, I can never know that, so should I assume the latter for my own sake?

Should I ever text her again? Should I just try forget about the whole thing and move on? Realistically, I've heard that in situations like this, where you are waiting around for a girl, it never works out.

She had a male coworker who is kind of her boss he’s been on the scene for around 6 months and kind of coached her into applying for a promotion which she got and has been helping her with that. They hung out on Saturdays maybe 6 times for a few hours and I was always cool with it as he’s married with kids although I haven’t met him. 

Monday this week I finished work and called to see if she wanted a lift home and she said nah I’m in the zone it’s all good ps if I see Steve we might get some food see you later and I was like ok. Then it’s like 9:30pm and I call her like hey where are you and she replied “I had dinner” ok? Where are you “ohh we’re just out at a restaurant” you and people from work? “Just Steve, we’re nearly done I’ll be home soon”. 

Then she gets in at half past midnight and I’m like wtf happened and she said that after dinner they just walked around for 2.5 hours. This is not normal in my city on a Monday night as it’s dead and the only people on the street at that time are people you don’t want to meet. 

I had a very weird feeling about it and so I check her messages and find that he asked her the day before if she wanted to go for dinner after work so she decided not to tell me that the day before and omitted it when I talked to her after work. Then when I called her out on that she said that she didn’t know they would go for dinner and it wasn’t organised prior and I said well I know it was. 

The 2.5 hours walking around the cbd is the hardest bit to understand but she’s definitely lied to me about it. I told her I want to break up.

For context, I am not a big texter at all so I told him right away that I don't enjoy constant text conversations and wakeup/goodnight texts put me off and he said he was the same and not to think something was wrong if we haven't talked in a few days.

We were not seriously dating and never discussed being exclusive or calling it a relationship, though he did mention several times that he was not seeing other people. He often remarked on how surprised he was to actually enjoy talking to me, which wasn’t as flattering as I think he thought it was.  In fact it was actually pretty hard to get him to leave most nights without just straight up telling him ‘it’s 1 am you need to go home now you can’t sleep here’ directly. Not to sound like a chump but he did seem to genuinely really like me.

Our last date I met his parents for dinner, after which he canceled several dates we had planned before I left for a 2 week trip, radio silence two days before I left. Meeting them didn't go horribly but it wasn't super great. He's kind of a mommas boy so I can assume that probably his mom didn’t like me (she kept making jokes about how 'weird' I was and he said nothing) and that influenced his sudden disinterest in me. Our last conversation he kept making excuses, albeit pretty good and reasonable excuses, for why he couldn't see me and I sent the last text in our history so I feel like the ball was in his court and he just decided to never respond?

the ignoring stings a bit but it’s not really a big deal, I think we disagreed on quite a few things and did not have humor or interests that meshed completely, he definitely was attentive, fun company, a giving lover, and was respectful, but still I'm definitely ready to never see him again whether I have to inform him I'm done or not.

I haven't reached out at all since he just stopped responding mid conversation, but with all the cancellation I feel it's safe to say he weaned then ghosted me and I can just move on? I’m still kind of new at dating and don't want to step on any toes.

When I asked my friends for advice they talked about how cold and distant my general demeanor is and how its possible he thought I somehow blew him off and is saving face for himself by not responding. I don't personally feel like this is the case but it is possible.

He unmatched me on tinder though he kind of seems like the type to have deleted it and I just didn't notice until now. He is still following me on some other social media.
