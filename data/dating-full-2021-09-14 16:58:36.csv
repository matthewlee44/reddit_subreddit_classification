I met him during his vacation in my city. He es 54 and I'm 27. So, we met on a date app, he's a handsome and very interesting man, we had a great night and talk about lots of stuff. I was impressed. 
So after we leaves he didn't want to keep contact, but I insisted to stay as friends. 
Somehow the friendship evolve quickly into something else and everything was just great beside the distance and age difference. 
After a couple months we confece he is married to a man of his same age and have been together for 12 years or so. 
My hearth was broken, he gave me 100 reasons, and I was so hung up on what we had created in very little time and from one night stand. So I decided to put my values and all my beliefs apart just because of him.

As an overthinker I realize the lack of consistency in his words and acts. They still their normal marry life. And I can't help feeling apart. I always priorize him and he talks to me when he has the chance (when his husband is not around or when they are not doing anything together I believe).  He sent me picks of his plans an all happy but he does this stuff with him.

He is coming again this year, to ""know me"" and proof if our thing it's real and maybe do ""a life together"". 

There's certain situations that makes me doubt of his words, his husband lives with him and needs him to stay on the country. 

I never ask what's the plan because I don't want to push. 

I'm afraid that he's just playing and I'm only a distraction of his routine. 

I'm fighting between my mind, the facts and my feelings.

I am a pretty friendly and outgoing person and can honestly talk to most people. It’s very hard for me to not get along with someone and have lasting conversations. 

My problem is that when I go on these dates and they go subjectively “well”, I’m like... did it go well because I shared a genuine romantic connection with them or because I could hold a conversation with them for 2 hours?

I always hear about how people feel this “spark” when they meet someone and I have never felt that in any of my relationships, platonic or romantic. Even all my closest friends are people I built shared experiences with and are now my best friends because of it, not because I felt a spark when I first met them.

My bf (23M) and I (22F) have been together for a while (friends to lovers). Two weeks ago he told me about this girl and her friends he met when he was out with his friends. I got a really bad feeling about that girl as soon as he told me. I felt like something was going on and he wasn’t telling me that. Not the feeling that he was cheating on me with her, but that there is something more to it.

Last night, he told me about that night and told me what they were talking about and my mind was instantly like “why did you talk like that with a person you just met”. When I was about to go home he said that has to tell me something. He told me that he knew that girl from highschool and that they didn’t meet that night as he told me. I asked why he didn’t tell me that before and he said that he didn’t want to tell me that through text since there was a possibility I could get it wrong. I believed him without questioning it more.

As soon as he told me that, I felt relieved. The stomach pain, nausea, anxiety, all of that was gone. I feel more calm now that I know the truth. I felt so uncomfortable before because I knew there was something else and I didn’t know what exactly.

 I don't do well alone and finding a partner in a world where meeting people in real life seems impossible without being rude(especially due to my horrible awkwardness and lack of natural social skills) and the fact that online dating feels worse is really rough.

Hi everyone,
So, last year while working at Asda, I met a girl who I fell for hard pretty much instantly. I liked pretty much everything about her, but unfortunately I waited to long to ask her out and another one of our co workers beat me to it. This obviously really sucked but I accepted it,and  thought maybe in the future when I’m no longer working with them and if she became single I could try  reach out on Instagram and maybe go from there (obviously not straight away after she became single though). I didn’t have a proper Instagram account at this point, just a blank one that I use to follow pages I like which is why I didn’t follow her then and she doesn’t have Facebook.

I ended up leaving the job in April and haven’t spoken to anyone there since then, at this point they were still together. I do have a proper Instagram account now. However, I’m pretty sure she knew I fancied her at the time, so I’m worried that following her now will just seem weird to her, especially if she’s still with her boyfriend. We never spoke outside work and I’ve not kept in touch with anyone there. I also kinda left the store on bad terms after getting fed up with management, so this might also make it a bit awkward to try and get back in touch with her. 
Just want to clarify as well that I’ve not just been sitting around waiting for her to become single, but I’ve not had anything serious since then and she came up again in my thoughts and I was wondering how she’s been.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1007013,public,self,Reaching out to a old crush/co worker,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/po8hay/reaching_out_to_a_old_crushco_worker/,all_ads,6,,,

We really get along, we make a good team when it comes to stuff that matters to both of us; we can cook together nicely, plan trips with no hassle, we like the same sort of activity, etc. 

But there is one major issue for me: I'm an insecure guy, and I tend to anxiously attach, and she is quite the opposite; trusting, secure in herself and in her looks, knows what she wants. This becomes hard for me to deal with mixed with her much-greater-than-mine sex life. Over the first few dates she was very open about having a super active sex life for a while in the past, which included quite a few ON,S and some open relationships.

Knowing all of the above brings thoughts like ""am I ever going to be enough?"", or ""is she just going to find some other dude"", even though she has explicitly told me that she hasn't felt like she does about me in years, and that she doesn't need nor want to see other people.

I notice myself becoming uncomfortable over unreasonable stuff — for instance she usually tells me when she finds people on TV attractive, and it makes me squirm... What the hell, dude?

I feel like the disparity in our levels of confidence, self esteem, and experience could pile up into a big ball of anxiety for me, and result in self-sabotage. I don't know how do deal with her, or my feelings about her experiences. She tries to be reassuring, but I feel so dumb and little :(

As a guy: do you prefer that someone you are vibing with let you know if shes continuing to actively date in this situ? Or does that still feel like a pressure-crazy-text thhis early?  

PS. I once went out with a guy I initially felt lukewarm about and i think he felt it. By the time i realized i wanted to actually pursue him, and asked him to meet again (i admittedly waited a week), he said “hey sorry i got serious about someone else.” And i felt major regret. I know that if he had given me the chance to decide, id have been less lukewarm.

Online dating is the easiest way to meet amazing women and get 2-3 even 4 dates per week, ONLY IF you follow some rules 👇

If your thoughts of online dating are these:

❌ There is no one serious on these apps
❌ Women ghost me and disappear 
❌ There is too much competition
❌Only attractive guys get matches

Then you seriously need to change the way you approach the online dating.

✅ First and foremost, UPLOAD QUALITY PICTURES. 

It's so simple yet, so many guys wonder why they are not getting responses. If you don't have good pictures, hire a photographer for a very small amount of money.

✅ STOP SENDING ""HI"" AND ""HOW ARE YOU"" OR EVEN ""YOU ARE HOT"".

These messages are huge turn off for women, simply because it shows that you are just another typical guy who doesn't really know how to communicate properly. Be different, send something funny or ""weird"" so it catches her attention.

✅ Stop being so overly excited about your matches.

Of course, it's great when you get matches. The serotonin levels are high at the moment. But, you don't even know her. Qualify her first, before you dive into arranging a date. And most importantly STOP being needy.

✅ Check how invested she is.

Check the length of her messages, and always match them with the length of your messages. Stop asking questions all the time, make positive assumptions about her. Also, convey a bit of your personality, so she can trust you before asking for a date.

There’s a lot of context — sorry!

Last November, I broke up with the guy I’d been dating since I was 12. All through high school, college, most of university — regardless of whether or not you can call it a ‘relationship’ at 12, it was a long 7.5 years in which we basically grew up together. 

The breaking point was the final time he ghosted me; not replying to any calls and texts for a week whilst I was away at uni (likely would have gone on longer, but I text him to say I would be ending it), and it was the third time he’d done so. The second time (around six months prior), it was three weeks with no response and I never got a full explanation — I told him at the time that if he needed mental health support I’d help him get it, but that I wouldn’t be put through it again. 

There were other issues in the relationship; I didn’t like that he was aimless in life, disagreements about what we’d do once I graduated (he wanted to stay in our home village, I wanted to move away), I felt like I had to ‘look after him’ and do all the cooking, make all the decisions, we had less than ideal communication — a good handful of things. But ultimately, I think we were both more content than we were happy, and it couldn’t have survived as an adult relationship. So I ended it. And after 8-9 months of *constant* texts and calls from him (I blocked him in March, he went as far as contacting my family etc until I set some boundaries with them in June), I finally have some peace.

But I keep getting bursts of just *missing* him. 

Or maybe just missing the comfort of the relationship? I don’t know. I had a short thing with somebody else for a few months before breaking it off because I just couldn’t feel ready to commit to someone new. It feels wrong to think about *trying* to get that close with another person, and it’s as though I can’t just relax and feel that way about someone else.

It’s been almost a year now, and I know for sure that things with my ex couldn’t work — nor do I want to try them again. But, God, does this feeling ever stop? He was the one person I felt fully at ease around, and I’m scared I’m never going to be that comfortable around somebody again. I don’t want to date, because I don’t want to be constantly comparing somebody to him; that wouldn’t be fair. And I feel guilty about feeling that way, because I’m the one who ended it in the first place. 

Has anybody had a similar situation? Have you managed to feel at ease in another relationship?

So, almost a year later, I went on a few dates before my birthday, managed about 5 in a couple of months just before I turned 40.

Then it happened, I was officially middle aged. I got rid of the apps because I was fed up with the quality of matches, some of the strange behaviour on dates and it was bringing me down.

I assumed I may run into someone, I might get a look thrown my way I could act on, or even a random conversation in a coffee shop.

I wasn't expecting the earth but honestly, it feels like I've lost my mojo, it's almost like I have a a neon sign with 40 blinking above my head. I don't know if it's mental, or I'm looking too hard into things but I feel a bit invisible to women if I'm honest.

I'm at the gym 6 days a week, I'm in good shape, always look smart and keep my hair well groomed.

Now I don't expect anyone to solve this, and personally, I feel like I may be putting out some sort of negative energy or maybe my lack of confidence is outwardly perceivable.

I'd just like someone to say, oh yeah, been there, it will come good, you're over thinking it. It's because of the lunar cycle etc.

we did have sex once but I told him I don’t want something casual; he said he doesn’t want that either, so I said I want to get to know him better before we jump into anything. Last time we hung out he told me he sees something in me, mentioned getting into a relationship in the future, that he would wait until I was “ready.” But keep in mind.. this is in the context of me saying no to sex almost every time because again, I don’t want something casual and he knows that. 

fast forward to now, we talk literally every day, but it’s gotten a little dry and we haven’t hung out in about a week. I don’t want to initiate “hanging out” because I’d rather go on a date, and I’ve said no to a few of his offers to hang for the same reason. Basically I’ve been waiting for him to step up and actually ask me on a 2nd date because I’ve told him that’s what I want. so he hasn’t asked me to hang in a while even when he knows I’m free. 

my overthinking ass (was it obvious) thinks there are two possible conclusions… 1) he just wanted me for sex/casual and was just saying those things, but now realizes I won’t give him that until he puts his words (wanting to be serious) into actions so he is giving up; or 2) he thinks I’m not interested anymore and/or thinks I’m being wishy washy because I won’t initiate anything and have turned down hanging out, so he doesn’t want to try….

We would hold hands, make out, feel each other around. I felt like there was real chemistry between us. Then she started going back and forth coming home and to that other town. We were talking and went out a couple of times, but she started replying to my messages like once a day or less. I felt as if she lost interest. We stopped talking. I was pretty disappointed but oh well.

And now, about a month ago I did a bad thing. I kind of have a boyfriend now, nothing serious, but still, quite a disrespectful act. I was at my friend's house, we were drinking, smoking etc. and her sister (HER) comes home. Drunk/high me follows her to the bathroom and kisses her. The next day she messages me saying how shes glad I did that. We start talking again and go to this festival together in separate friend groups. We shared a tent and spent every night together. We even discussed the possibility of us actually being a couple. When we got back home we went on 2 dates and slept together. We continued messaging every day and then she went back to college town (most of her friends are there). For some reason when she's in college town her replies are much rarer but I can see she's active on social media. I'm not the best replier so I don't really mind. She comes back home again and starts replying actively. Goes back to college town and the slow replies are back again. It took her over 24h to reply to my last message and I just don't feel like talking anymore. Getting one message a day makes me feel like she lost interest again and I am again left disappointed. I cheated on the guy I'm seeing for what. I have been planning on ending things with him romantically (and will do it soon) since we are more like friends than lovers, but that doesn't make it alright. But that is a whole other story now.

(I’ve never had a girlfriend before so I’m pretty oblivious about such cues.) And by flirty I mean: she will sometimes hug me (I have not seen her do this with any other guy at the workplace), she usually calls me nicknames, she asks me to come over to where she is sometimes and usually chats me up a little or asks me a random quick question, occasionally asks what I’m doing on a weekend and suggests drinking or other kind of outing, she also rarely suggests her giving me her phone number but her friends/female coworkers have pretty much always stopped or interrupted thinking that i’m being bothered by her (I’m a very passive, laid back person so I understand them acting that way lol).

At first I thought she just liked messing with me like in a platonic/friendly way, but now I’m starting to believe she’s possibly romantically interested in me. And her general “warmth” has begun making me kind of like her a lot. 

I think I would totally date this girl if she asked me out in a way that wasn’t too subtle for me to understand or if I knew for sure she was into me in this way and that I had the perfect opportunity to ask her. I just don’t know how to approach this being a total relationship virgin. 

And yes, I’m aware of the risks that are involved with dating a coworker, I think she is cool enough that I’m willing to take those risks!

Everything was going great we had this crazy connection and bond and agreed we’re both so alike. I never felt this deep for someone before it was an amazing feeling.

He didn’t explain why he just said he’s not ready right now and wants to take things slow. Although he was always calling me babe and telling me everyday he missed me etc. When we were together he would hold my hand and always be very affectionate. I asked him if he was talking to anyone else and he said no he is only interested in me and I said the same. This past weekend we were spending time together and he then told me he doesn’t think he’s over his ex and that if she were to reach out to him he’s unsure if he would want to try things again with her as they had spent years together. I felt totally blindsided and hurt because he told me prior that it wasn’t a good relationship and that they mutually ended it. I was really starting to fall for this guy and we talked about always spending weekends together and then this came up out of nowhere I instantly started crying. He apologized and told he he still really likes me and has feelings for me and said he’s just really confused and needs to think. He hasn’t messaged me since. Is it over?

Needless to say, I got super excited about this and got my hopes up (doh!).  Well, it’s been a few days and I haven’t received a single message from him.  I know that he’s swamped with his job but I have to admit I’m a bit hurt that I haven’t heard back from him yet.  I keep overthinking things (for example, if he were really genuinely interested he’d find time to reach out; maybe he’s really not interested in me; he’s talking to other women, etc.).  I’ve gone back and forth with myself about sending him a message first but the thought of a delayed/no response would send my anxiety through the roof.

My boyfriend (29M) end our relationship on sunday, he say that he didnt feel comfortable with the last things that happen between us and he wasn't feeling as much as I do, and that makes him feel uncomfortable and frustrated, those were the reasons. We were dating for 7 months and I things were really good, i feel in love with him and i felt that he could be the person to spent the rest of my life.   But he think I took things a little fast for his taste, he is a more self contained person and im more relax.

I admit my fault in the things, i know, make him uncomfortable, and apologize for it. He only say: "" I forgive you"". The things that make him uncomfortable:

\- Told him my family want to meet him, and invited him to a carnita asada party.  He felt pressure and scared of that, I only mentioned twice, when they gave the invitation and confirming if he will go. 

\- Wearing a ring in my anular finger that he gave me (cause i like it and he gave it, after i ask if i could keep it, just that, it didnt symbolize anything deeper, for me it was just a reminder of him that I can have daily).

\- One day I got mad due work stuff , he showed me a ring that he use to have and I ask the really dumb question of who he gave it, and he answer with the truth (ex-girlfriend) and I got jealous, and he got uncomfortable due my jelousy ( I admit I was wrong and apologize for it at the moment). Later it got really late and he live far from where we were and I told him I drove him near his house, he didnt want to cause he feels it should be even and that wasnt, I didnt care and drove him near his house, he got really mad, I cry and apologize for my tamtrum of leaving him near. This was the end of the road.

On sunday I feel insecure and sad, and after the evening together i just pull the trigger and ask if he wanted to dump me, his answer was yes and he told me all this stuff, and that he wanted to end it after the reunion with my family (which I think he wasnt coming but thats the date he puts in his agenda to dump me) and he tols me that we should keep the plans for the weekend and talk more deeply about it ...

We have been talking almost like normal, I just talk as if he was friend no cheesy stuff or cute emojis, sending him hugs like I do with all my friends, and he has been sending cute emojis and been a little more caring ... now I feel im the cold one ... I dont know what to think.

I dont know how to feel, I dont know if I should see him on the weekend (I want to, but if all things are going to the end why I should go, thats the questioning).  I dont know if it still worth it?

I went on two great dates with a new guy and we went back to his place after the second and hooked up.  He's nice, funny, has a good job, we share interests, want similar things, and there's mutual attraction, but his place was kind of a mess and it's killing the vibe for me. He basically had no furniture, just a mattress on the floor, boxes and clutter everywhere, etc. The bathroom was the worst by far, toilet was gross and there was hair all over the counter.

Both of us have depression and the pandemic has been weird so I can empathize, but we're at an age where I expect people to put in a certain amount of effort for a good impression and to make sure I'm comfortable (the lack of consideration is the main issue and bothers me more than the mess itself).

I'm conflicted because I'm really excited about the potential and he seems seriously interested too, but if we're going to keep seeing each other I need him to like... clean.

Attractive girl approached me at the gym and started talking to me.

I didn't see her next until about a week later at the gym, and she approached me again teasing and flirting with me. I thought this was a clear sign that she was interested, so I asked for her number saying we could plan a workout together or something casual. 

The second I asked for her number I could see her mood change , and she hesitated before giving me her number. I knew immediately this was an L, and she did in fact end up ghosting me or just gave me a fake number.

So for context I’m 23, a virgin, never been in a relationship or on a date or anything . As far as I’m aware no girl has ever been interested in me in that way beyond one or two drunken makeouts over the years. I think it’s a mix of having been an ugly duckling growing up, having self/esteem and confidence issues, overthinking and being a nervous wreck around people I like, just being unlucky in falling for unavailable people, not acting on feelings, etc. Over the years I’ve worked on my looks, I’m a bit more confident with girls I’m into, I try not to overthink so much, and I’ve just in general worked on myself a lot and naturally come into my own a little more.

At the weekend there I was out at a party with some friends and was kind of joking around with a bunch of the girls I’ve been friends with for years who we met there, and in particular jokingly flirting with one of them, and while we were both laughing together she, in the most genuine way, asked in the middle of our conversation ‘how the fuck are you still single after all this time? It makes no sense.’

All of our other friends instantly agreed and started going on about me and kind of just giving me compliments. Usually I’d think it’s just people being nice; people always say that kind of thing when my whole romantic life comes up and it feels empty. But this was different. This was just a bunch of girls I’ve been friends with, who are able to look  at me from the point of view of straight women, having such a good time and a good laugh with me that they were just genuinely baffled by the fact I’ve remained single this long. It had nothing to do with our conversation beyond the fact I was jokingly flirting and it probably made them think along the lines of me and relationships. This isn’t the first time either; another girl I’m friends with thought I was lying to her when the fact I’m still a virgin came up, and outright refused to believe it for the longest time.

It was a big confidence boost and I feel like I’m on the right track these days in regards to all that, but like, what is the answer here? Like why have I remained single for so long? I just laughed and had no answer for them, but it did get me thinking. They seemed completely genuine, truly baffled by the fact I have never had a girlfriend. I’ve always assumed there MUST be something wrong with me and people were just being kind, but more and more often people really do seem like they can’t understand. The thing is, if they’re right and I’m not some kind of undateable guy like I always thought growing up, then I must be missing chances, or not doing something right, or just being the most unlucky dude on the planet.

It’s just left me more confused. I kind of accepted over the years I’m unattractive, I came to terms with it and honestly just kind of didn’t try so much outside of when I really fell for someone and couldn’t ignore it, but now it’s like I’m wondering am I actually kind of attractive and I’ve just been doing something fundamentally wrong for a long time? I honestly just plain, straight up do not understand what the hell I should be doing lmfao, I’m 23 but I feel like the way I approach relationships is the same way a 14 year old boy does.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1007515,public,self,"A few friends told me, in the most genuine way, that they have no idea why I’ve been single my whole life, and it’s something I cannot seem to answer",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pog65x/a_few_friends_told_me_in_the_most_genuine_way/,all_ads,6,,,

Although we work at the same place (National Park) we wouldn't see eachothwr throughout the day, maybe for brief moment. ( before I go too deep in, I should say, she just broke up with her BF of 2 years. I would say about a week in to us talking) So we started talking on Snapchat for about a week and it was going well. she invited me over to her house and we just hanged out and she invited me over again the next day. That night, we kinda cuddled and made out but nothing more. Now a couple weeks passes and we are still talking on snapchat every single day, I would send goodmorning text, she would send good night text, stuff like that. We were flirting pretty hard with eachother by now, I made it clear that I really liked her and I think she liked me too. She would send me suggestive tiktoks everyday and she would talk about wanting kids and how handsome my kids would be. She came over to my place and stayed the night for 2 nights in a row. Those nights, stuff happend and it was a really good time. now it was about the end of August and we were both going back to Uni. we go to different Universities about 2 hours away and it was clear we weren't gonna be able to see eachother often. we kept talking for about a week and we called eachother at night and we would go to sleep on thr call and wake up with thr call still active, this happened a few times. Now, the night before our first classes began (both our classes started on the same day) she said she just wanted to be friends, that this whole thing was too fast and that she wasn't ready for a relationship. I was devastated, i thought we both liked eachother and things would of picked up but no. I was nice in responding, I said that I understood and it was fine and we both wished good luck in our classes. But, I felt horrible, ive probably cried more in the 3 days after that she said she wanted to be friends than i have in my entire life. She is still constantly on my mind. Now it's been a week since that day , and we haven't talked since than except for once where she texted me asking me if I was ""safe"" due to a campus evacuation due to a bomb threat. I just replied that I was safe and we only texted for about 5 minutes. Now I checked snapchat today and i saw that she has removed me from it. we still follow eachtoher on Instagram however. So I was wondering why this is? Did I get played, lead on? I can't help but think that I was just there for attention after her breakup and she actually didn't feel anything toward me.
