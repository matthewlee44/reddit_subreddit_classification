We hung out this past weekend. I slept over friday night after picking her up from her friend's place where she was basically blacked out drunk and brought her back to her place. I slept on the couch that night. Next morning i went out, got us some food and her some electrolytes to help her get over the hangover. We spent the rest of the day going out for a walk and grabbing some food, enjoying each other's company. 

I followed up on monday with a call that went well. We talked for close to an hour and felt like things were clicking again and back on track. Fast-forward to tonight. I notice she hasnt texted much the previous night or all of today. I call her to see how she's doing. Found out she took an edible yesterday (which idc) to get over some stress/anxiety she's having. We talk for like \~17 minutes but i notice she's not really feeling it and then she just says ""i dont really feel like talking right now. i just want to watch tv."" and im like ""yea ok no problem. have a good night."" and she hangs up. Almost immedietly she follows up with a text saying sorry and realized how bad that sounded and then says she doesnt know how she feels emotionally and whatnot.

I basically send a text saying it's ok and that if we're not compatible, it is what it is. That's just life. I do like her and care about her but if she's not ready or isnt feeling it or isnt into me then no reason to force it and that we can take a break or just be friends.

Me: Female: 24 (25 in May) 
So last year I came out as Bisexual. Since then I’ve been getting out there in the dating would with just girls. It has been somewhat and somewhat not successful. I met a girl we will call her Sara. Sara and I’ve been taking for months and I mean month since mod October. She made it clear in her bio she’s only look for friends and if she finds the right girl, she will see where it goes. I did ask her out in December she said not right now because it was going to be a hectic month. I figured but had to try. January I asked again as she had finished her class portion into becoming a nurse. She had covid and then tested positive then 3 weeks later tested negative so I ask her out. She said yes and we actually FaceTime for the first time. Yes months and months later. We had Snapchat previously so it wasn’t like I knew she wasn’t cat fishing me. I find out on our second FT she has a son. I told her that’s fine I didn’t care. We went on a date few weeks later. Nothing happened because it was my first date. It was also very and I mean short a little over an hour. She wanted to be home to put her kid down. 2-3 weeks later we were FaceTiming and she asked me if I was interested in dating. I said yes of course. 2 weeks later she texts me telling me she not ready to pursues a relationship with anyone. I was surprised to be honest that wanted to at the time. She was starting a new job in less then a month, she was trying to move from her dads house into her own apartment on top of a kid. I was initially annoyed of course cause 1. She did on the day  I was going to come over. 2. It felt like she kind of set up me but at the same time I’m not that made.  We ended up having to cancel because her son call him John got sick. We went out 2 weeks later. 
So here we are the end of April nothing has happened. She’s planning to move by June as she found a couple places but won’t be ready until June. I already know that nothing romantic will happen until at least maybe July which sucks. By then it will be what are least 8 months? I haven’t talked to anyone else and she hasn’t either. At least that’s what she saying but I believe her in some sense. In the last month however I feel like things have just taking a turn into the friend zone. 2 months ago we were talking about multiple future dates. Kissing, sex a bunch of well dating things. Even me seeing/sleeping over at her’s at least 2-3 times a month (we are about 1 1/2 from each other). She has unofficial full custody of her son. So zero to no chance of her ever come over and sleeping at my place. I’m aware and accepted that. 
Now? It feels like it just friends. I mean I also feel like it more one sided (mine). I text her first all the time. She use to call me first but now it like I feel I’m annoying when I call her. I mean she said a month ago when I asked if she was still interested “yes I still am or I wouldn’t be talking to” she’s mentioned to be shes bad at texting and could sometimes go a week without texting anyone. 
Now I’ve acknowledged I need to talk to her but the reality is that I know I’m not going to get an answer until at least mid May when she gets closer to settling in. I don’t want to ask each month I would be annoyed. I’m just think things have different because she just started her job 2 weeks ago. But part of me is slowly letting go of the idea of it going anywhere. So that if by July she no longer wants to pursues it as romantic I won’t be as hurt. Part of me says she won’t do that. That she wants to give it a try. But part of me thinks maybe she changed her mind. Which of course she has every right to. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation. How long were you friends? If both parties knew what they wanted but 1 party wasn’t ready yet so you decided to be friends. How long? Was it worth it? Am I just wasting my time? If she have suggestion on how to not overthink it? I’ve had bad past relationship and trying not to fall off the deep end. 
I’m currently not looking for anything new with a new girl at this time because my life with working two jobs is going to far to busy to handle anything new. 
I apologize that it was long but I felt like it needed all of that.

At first, everything was great, we’re both sending paragraphs, keeping the conversation alive without ever dipping into small talk, etc..
But then starting a couple days ago, the time it took him to open my messages really shot up. At first, he would respond within an hour 98% of the time. Monday was 5-6 hours. Tuesday was 13. However, after both of those big gaps he would answer my messages within 10-30 mins and we could still have a conversation. But today it took him 20 hours to open my message, I messaged back a couple hours later, he hasn’t opened it. So that was it for today 

His responses are still engaging, as in still putting effort into his responses/not killing the conversation but he hasn’t said anything about being busy or given any reason for the delay. Also no talk of a date still.

I’m really new to dating and I just am lost on what to do. We were flirting and having a great conversation Sunday, and he was even saying stuff like hoping I don’t end up hating/blocking him but I can’t think of any other reason for this lack of effort in the conversation except him losing interest. It sucks because over the last couple weeks I’ve grown to really like this guy and I don’t want to just give up because he seems really cool. I’ve been trying to get advice from my friend but she’s been getting really annoyed with me, so I figured I would just turn here. 

What should I do in this situation? Is the conversation dead and should I just leave it be? Should I try to keep it alive until the weekend in the hopes he hasn’t been answering cause he was busy and will have more time then? Should I just message him and address it directly that I feel like he’s lost interest? I know this sounds stupid but I have social anxiety and the in-between are really hard for me. The time gaps says he isn’t interested but the messages say he is. My friend says I shouldn’t put effort into someone that obviously doesn’t like me, but I don’t want to just give up without knowing it’s that for sure. I feel really embarrassed and kind of stupid answering within a couple hours when it takes him 20 hours to reply to me but I don’t know what else to do.

“I’m afraid to catch feelings for so and so.” 
It’s a phrase that has always confused me, especially for people who are already intimately involved. Rejection is natural and often, it’s not all about you. When you’re doing couple like things, couple like emotions are going to form because you two are already a couple with official establishment. Intimacy, good vibes and a good connection are things that cannot be easily faked or held back. 

When I was dating casually before my current bf, I “caught feelings” for guys I viewed as a potential partner because I liked them more than I initially intended. I could either have unrequited love and never tell them or just tell them to get it over with: rejection or becoming official. I’ve actually had casual arrangements break things off with me because they claimed they caught feelings but don’t want to commit. It just made me confused because if you’re catching feelings for me, then I must have relationship qualities but you don’t want to be locked down. 

Maybe because it’s my personality to be happy go lucky and not taking things to heart. I have had friends, both male and female, fall apart while using my as their free therapist telling me that they caught feelings as if they caught a sickness.

I was in love with a girl in high school and after we went to college, she got married to a guy, got a baby boy and settled down. We broke up in good terms because we both knew we couldn't make it work. After this I got so emotional and never really recovered from it, even though i pat myself for forgetting her and moving on but whenever I go by the place she once lived, my mind automatically searches for her face. I couldn't control this. 

  
After graduation I got a job with decent pay just enough to stand out and survive in a city. I really took serious moves to date a girl and share everything i have in my life. Idk why. Maybe it's the looks or status or way of talking IDK man, I don't get to know what the other side expects from me.   
I tried all sorts of way of dating like going out and meeting a girl, exchange numbers and chat for months just to get ghosted. Dating apps are full of clout chasers and till date i didn't get any match in spite of wasting hours upon hours just swiping and scrolling. 

  
Eventually I tried reddit for this, I now changed my plan, getting a friend and becoming a close friend to get to know whether we are suitable for a relationship or not. I did this couple of times and made good friends(But yeah i don't like dating them). 

  
As far as i know friendships sometimes leads to a healthy relationship since the compatibility factor is very high when compared to a random stranger. That's why I tried this thing. But soon i realized this is not the right way, because all the men competing here(subreddits for dating) knows the game in an out. they know how to get attention, flex, etc etc but am not that type of guy, am like the guy who will give 100 percent in whatever am doing even if idk what I am doing. am the type of person who cares and expects nothing in return except loyalty. 

  
So, I would like to ask the people here what the fuck am i doing wrong. Should I make myself look dateable material online? or Try to hit every girl who is looking for the same as me? or Try to improve my humour? or The pick up lines should be more catchy? am fed up man, all the people around irl are awesome with what they have in relationship wise. Will I be single till i hit 30? IDK.

I’ve had guys (I’m 26F) basically just open with what’s your Snapchat. I don’t have Snapchat, I’m not cool with sending boob pics and sexting. A lot of them usually drop off here which sucks.

I just want to make sure the guy isn’t a creep, he actually looks like his pics (run into a few of those bad ones when romantic dating), and then go have a good time.

probably like my sophomore year of highschool I followed her dating “rules” to a T with her help lol. she was like an expert on that stuff. and i ended up getting the guy of my highschool dreams. so pOpUlAr and cute and all around good guy. i know it probably wasn’t because of following all her steps but they definitely helped, it was still really fun, and in a nice way, not manipulative. to this day he is still great, we dated for 5 years until college we went our separate ways.

Tldr; I’m getting tired of this misconception that because I’m frustrated sexually and romantically that makes me entitled.

I’m 22 years old. I have never held hands, hugged, (unless another guy initiated a girl to do so out of pity), kissed, or had sex with a a girl *authentically*.

Getting told no and told you are ugly throughout your entire life is *going* to take a toll on your psyche. You cannot be rejected and still go “I’m the shit”. It doesn’t work like that.

If it affects my self esteem and I’m constantly searching for answers, going through relentless amounts of therapy (*apparently* me being the problem after relentless years of bullying and mistreatment) is it entitlement? I’m the one with the suffering self esteem and made to feel bad whenever I complain about having never experienced *anything*.

If anyone’s self entitled here it’s the good looking people who automatically feel deserving of a relationship just because they are good looking. Or act like they earned it because they were blessed with their genetics the same way *anyone* else in their lives were.

I’ve always put myself out there. I’ve always been brave enough to tell a girl how I feel as soon as I’ve built up enough of a rapport or friendly relationship with them. I don’t ‘hang out’ with them like friends or treat women like friends. Only if it’s in a professional environment or I *genuinely feel like they earned my friendship* which is a title I don’t take lightly.

Like I said. I’m suffering badly with deprived of touch, sexual experiences and love because I truly believe that women pose extremely high standards that end up making some men just become invisible. At times I will watch girls glance at me walking by and then the hot guy will walk in and it’s all eyes on him.

I’m sorry I’m just describing what I’ve been experiencing *IN REAL LIFE*. It’s never been different.

I am working *so hard* now more than ever on my jobs, hobbies, passions, with my family, friends people that actually deserve my time and attention because they are willing to give something in return a reward for my hard work.

I went on a first date and it really knocked my socks of. My date seemed to really have a good time and it's been one of the best dates in a while. A few days later we went on a lunch date during the week. I was really stressed about work and that specific day was rough. I went to lunch with her and I acted a bit aloof and uninterested and I also had to take several work calls and and I just wasn't there. I was not completely myself  It just wasn't a fun meetup and I didn't give off the best impression. I figured I messed it all up. I didn't hear anything from her after that date. Fast forward a few days I called her. She texted me late that evening apologizing for missing the call and that she had been helping her mom after a procedure. We texted a bit and I ended up telling her I had a rough day on the lunch date and said sorry if I had come off as uninterested or rude. I told her if she was still feeling it we could try again the following week. Didn't hear anything back. Fast forward a bit more. I get a text out of the blue with her apologizing for being distant and that she hasn't been in the best mood and she has been hanging out with her mom. I told her I understood and I hope things get better with her mom. She said thank you and then back to not hearing anything. Should I just drop this completely?

I showed Up to his place and he decided to let me stay over. I've been here for almost 3 weeks and I have started to fall in love with him, we were drinking     And playing video games when I asked letan if he's ever been with someone, he said no. Me being drunk let out a sigh of relief he then said he didn't buy into the whole concept of love. 

This shocked me he doesn't believe in love I was there for like 4 minutes trying to recover from what he said I asked him why he said. ""Love isnt real, thats its just the brain tricking you.""

The date was perfect for what we were able to do during lockdown, and we shared the same feelings for each other as it turned out. Unfortunately, she had to step away rather suddenly towards the end of our date when she received a call telling her her grandad had been rushed to the hospital and she came to me saying how sorry she was and that she really enjoyed her time with me and we should pick this up again some other time. So after the exchanging of numbers and a prolonged, passionate first kiss, we parted ways and I messaged her later telling her I had a really good time and I hope everything’s going ok, to which she replied with how she really enjoyed it too and we’ll see where things go between us.

That was five weeks ago, and in that time, both of us have gone through some rather trying times that have made it difficult for us to maintain the mental capacity for a second date, her perhaps more so. She was let go from our workplace after taking too many days off and not attending her scheduled shifts and I have no idea what’s going on because she hasn’t told me anything except she’s going through a lot right now and she’ll return my calls when she’s ready to talk. I checked in with her again a couple weeks ago, and she pleaded with me to not stress too much about the whole thing and she’ll be over it soon with two little Xs at the end of the message, but since then, nothing. And I’m not entirely sure if I should close the distance by giving her a call to see what kind of headspace she’s at now and arrange a time and place to talk about our communication during this whole ordeal or if I need to wait for her call. Either way, I don’t want to screw things up between us by waiting too long or being too hasty to arrange a second meet and it’s only been a day after the funeral for my late grandad so realistically, I also want to be careful of bringing that on her.

We started texting for a day and had really nice banter, the same interest in social justice theory, and shared aspirations of finding a committed relationship. 

We had our first date 4 days ago, and had our second planned for today. We’ve been texting every night, and within a texting convo I told him last night that I went out to dinner. He asked me if it was a date. I was surprised by the question I said yes because I didn’t want to lie. 

He responded: “But hey I’m not like upset or anything, but I’m looking for something a little more serious. And maybe I’m a dinosaur for this, but taking turns w other men just isn’t the situation for me. So I don’t think we should pursue this further. You seem great though, so if you wanna keep in touch, feel free to add me on social media or shoot me a text whenever :)”

He’s yet to explicitly cancel our date tonight (even though I’ve asked him if we’re still on). I went on to affirm my desire for a committed relationship and pushed back on the idea of me “taking turns w men.” I don’t sleep around (no judgment to those who do). And this date I had planned before I met M27. He just said he was “an old soul” and that “this wasn’t his fairytale.”

He also added “btw I had the a total fantasy about u while at the gym earlier 😂”
🥴🥴🥴

I just feel gaslight by the idea that me going on multiple first dates (not hookups) and deciding if I want to pursue someone further is “taking turns w men”. I want a committed relationship, but I believe that I can’t know enough about someone from a dating app to commit/be exclusive after one date. Later (like after 3+ dates or a month), I think that that’s a reasonable conversation to have because I’ve learned enough about this person.

But then she went back home for break, so I guess we turned to pen pals, but in that time where we talked a lot for a few months I really got to know her and I know it might be weird but I think I developed some feelings for her, we related a lot on hard times that we’ve both experienced and we had a lot of common interests. But it wasn’t always easy bc sometimes we’d go through periods where she would be kinda distant and she would later say she’s going through something. Then it looked like she moved to a different state, and she ended up ghosting me so I figured that was it and she’s gone forever.

Well fast forward to a few weeks ago, and I saw from social media that she came back to school. I did think about her quite a bit before but then when she came back I couldn’t get her out of my mind. So last night I was going out to some bar, and then I get tapped on the shoulder by someone, low and behold it’s her. So then we talked for a long time, danced and made out a lot. Then I walked her home and she said she was still dealing with the same issues as before but didn’t want to get into it. Then when we got there she invited me in and I stayed the night with her.

So when I was there, I kinda was telling her that I was glad I ran into her and that I thought about her a lot when she was gone and that I really like her. Then she just started crying, then she started explaining how she was raped when she lost her virginity and the other two times she had sex the guys didn’t care about her. She was saying that the reason she ghosted me was because of those past experiences have made her feel like no one gives a shit about her and that it’s very hard for her to trust a guy again. So I guess what I’m asking is, does anyone have any advice on how to handle this situation?

I’m F20. I feel like nothing ever works out regarding dating for me. I tried Tinder, I went on a few dates but the guys turned out to be only after sex too quickly for me. 

In high school, I never really had a friend group that contained guys - I always hung out with girls. I did chat to people in clubs and bars, but it never went beyond that.

College started 6 months ago, we had our Syllabus Weeks and a few parties, I did, again, chat to many guys there too but we 1) either only had small talks and that’s it OR 2) they don’t remember anything the next day. Heck, I exchanged Snapchats with one of the guys and turned out he’s engaged!

After syllabus weeks I didn’t really find my friend group yet, and got to know only a few girls better. I’d be lying if I said it doesn’t concern me when I see others somehow formed bigger friend groups and spend time together even in this lockdown and remote teaching.

I’m just scared that all my experience in dating won’t increase.. I don’t know if it’s bad luck that I haven’t got to know the right guys, but I really wouldn’t want to only hookup with some Tinder guy just to get some experience in dating.

The problem is, if I spend a minute reading through a profile and decide to swipe left, that's a minute down the drain with no return on that time invested. Likewise, if I spend a minute reading through a profile and decide to swipe right but ultimately don't get a match, that's another minute wasted. The only time when my minute invested pays off is when I swipe right and get a match. The problem is, I could have gotten the same result spending much less than a minute on her profile. If I was on a serious dating site where I get to start things off with a message, spending some time reading her bio could help me come up with a thoughtful message to get things started, and spending more time reading and thinking about what I'm going to say could increase my chances of getting a response, but it doesn't work that way on Tinder. There, no matter how much time I spend thinking about it beforehand, the only thing I can do is swipe right. No amount of forethought or planning can make that swipe better or worse, and she won't even know about it unless she too decides to swipe right. So with that in mind, the best thing to do is come up with a way to decide whether to swipe right or left as fast as possible, and pictures make that easy to do. All I have to do is swipe right on everyone who looks attractive and swipe left on everyone who doesn't. With that strategy, getting through all my free swipes for the day takes 5 minutes instead of an hour. It's not like I'm missing out on anyone cool by running out of swipes before I get to them either; by the time I get to the end of my allotted swipes I'm swiping on girls who are 75 miles away or more.

I’ve (26F) just moved to study in a different country and recently this guy (27M) started talking to me. We have a few lessons together and the ones on zoom he would privately message me and we would chat the whole time, mostly him initiating the conversations. One of the first things that made me think he might like me is when I said I was struggling with something he said he could come round and help me (we live in the same building). I decided to to message him after having some drinks with friends and he ended up coming round (it was like 2am) but we just hung out and it wasn’t super flirty. 

We’ve hung out since quite a lot just me and him, and a few times he’s come round mine for dinner which has been really nice. There was a recent time when we were hanging out and he was super flirty and touchy, and another time when he said I looked beautiful in a photo amongst some other stuff. So I feel like there’s quite a few positive nice things that makes me think he likes me....

However, there’s other times where I feel like I’ve got it wrong? Sometimes around pals he’s a bit awkward around me and he also doesn’t really instigate much or message me. There’s also times where he doesn’t want to hang out. He’s also been having a not so great time recently due to corona stress etc, so he is flying back to his home country in a couple of days for a few weeks. We made lose plans to have dinner before. 

Basically, I have no idea if he actually likes me or if I’m just making this all up in my head. I know that he got out of a relationship too a few months ago so I’m not sure. I also feel like I don’t want to be too intense or needy, so I’m not even sure if I should mention about dinner before he goes.

In full honesty, do you think they’ll care that I’m not fully white? Are biracial girls common over there? I’d just like to know what to expect.

Also, will most white men see me as a « second choice »? As in, they prefer to date the white blonde but are mildly okay settling for the dark haired mixed girl?

Ever since I can remember, most of my crushes never liked me back and usually they go after either a good friend of mine or a good friend of his. As it goes on, I don't really care much up until I finally got into relationships. In my previous relationships, I was emotionally cheated by my then-boyfriends with either a good friend of mine or a good friend of his.

It's safe to say that I definitely developed trust issues. I am now with my current boyfriend (20m) and during the earlier parts of our relationship I noticed that he was texting a girl he used to have a crush on and she was also a good friend of his. My insecurities got the best of me and I went through his phone to check what they talked about. He then notices that I went through his phone and got really upset to the point he cried because I didn't trust him. I felt awful about it and promised to never snoop on his phone again. A few weeks later, I don't really remember what we talked about before but he mentioned that he stopped texting her and I was RELIEVED that they stopped talking.

But recently, when he was texting beside me, I saw they were talking again. At first I didn't want to mention it and I tried to just pretend I didn't see it. It bothered me but not to an extent where I want to cause any issues between us. A couple days later, he was on his computer and I saw that the girl texted him again(his text messages were connected to his computer). So, I pointed it out to him with a displeased look and all he said to me 'I love you, don't think too much into it'. But I'm an overthinker, so I came up with the wildest theories and basically just wondering what they talked about that they often text each other. 

A couple of nights ago, I asked what he looks for in a partner and he replied with ""comfortability and humour"". Then, I asked him who has same sense of humour as him, he then listed out all this guy friends and her (note: she wasn't the only girl here. there's another girl but the other girl is madly in love with her boyfriend, so I am not as 'threathened'). After that, I asked him if he finds me funny, he said that maybe I am funny to other people but to him, I'm not. I was sad and this just made me think that he doesn't find my conversations as entertaining than hers.

I told him that I'm not comfortable that he's talking to her again and he then just laughed it off saying I don't have anything to worry about because he loved me. All I'm thinking is if he loved me so much why can't he just stop talking to her? But I didn't wanna say it because I didn't want to control him. I asked him what they talked about most of the time, he said mostly just inside jokes, drawings she made, tiktoks, clothes, school and other things. I pointed out that I sent him tiktoks and he rarely watch them. Hell, he doesn't even send me tiktoks but HE'S SENDING IT TO HER? He said she does this to everyone (I don't believe that's a good excuse though, she doesn't send them to me)

At this point, I was visibly frustrated and upset about it. He promised to talk to her less often now. He also started bombarding me with tiktok videos (which he rarely does), I personally think it's just his way of reassuring me. But this morning when I was with him, he opened his messages and who did he texted last night? Her. I literally just told him the night before that I don't like that they were still talking but he still does it anyway! I pointed it out to him and he tried to laugh it off and said I was cute for being jealous  as if that makes me feel better! He apologized and tried to be affectionate with me, it calmed me down for awhile. But looking back, it made me more sad and frustrated that he doesn't respect my opinion. 

A few hours ago, I told him I need a break from him for a couple of days because I was just exhausted feeling insecure. I think he was very confused because he felt like me taking a break from him was out of nowhere and he felt like our relationship have been very smooth together. I obviously don't feel that way but I felt bad that I think I leaded him to think I was okay when in fact I'm not. I do believe that he loves me, it's just that my insecurities lead this to happen and I don't know what to do with myself or how handle them.
