I became more friendly too i asked her why she didn‚Äôt finish her food and she told me she was full and stuff like that.

One day they paid the bill and went out minutes later she came back alone while her friends were waiting outside and she asked me if there‚Äôs an internet cafe nearby i gave her directions and she went out.

Just went through a really bad dating experience with a guy who said he wanted to be in a relationship only to get laid. He also ended up having a shady criminal past. I deleted all dating apps and then someone randomly hit me up on social media. Acted super sweet for a month then ghosted me and acted completely different. I feel like it‚Äôs gotten much worse than maybe 5 years ago. I feel like people expect hookups to work even if they don‚Äôt tell people that‚Äôs what they want at first. Not to mention we live in the age of being ghosted. People say I‚Äôm getting much older and I‚Äôve been wanting to find a life partner for a long time.

I understand that this is really stupid and quite sad but i genuinely just need to get it off my chest.

I have been talking to a man for a few months now. It has been very flirty and he seems to be very interested in me. I only recently became interested in him; he was definitely in pursuit before me. I even told my friends about him and it looked like it was really going to happen this time. Everything was totally fine and smooth sailing up until today.

I saw a picture of a cake on his story that had writing on it saying ""thanks for bomb d*ck"". (Keep in mind I said this was stupid, but hear me out.) When i saw it my heart really dropped into my butt, no exaggeration. I dont think ive felt this dread in a really long time. I asked him what it was, and he said simply ""its a cake :)"". 

Now he isnt responding, but i want clarification now rather than later. I dont want to wait to find out who its from or if its serious. I thought we were supposed to be exclusive and I was genuinely excited because I have very bad luck in dating.


I feel like I want to cry, but nothing is coming out. Why do people do this? Why not just tell me the truth? He asked me previously if i had a man, and was happy when I said i dont. Now I find out hes having sex with other women while I've been talking to him exclusively. We havent even had sex yet, I'm not rich, so I haven't been used in any capacity. He just lied to me for months for absolutely no reason. I don't understand why he couldnt just disagree with my terms and be friends with me instead.

First of all I want to apologize for making this a bit long. I would really appreciate getting your thoughts on this.

I‚Äôm in college and there is a girl that I‚Äôm very very interested in, I‚Äôve never been this interested in somebody like this before since she‚Äôs one of the last left pure girls. The reason for this, she checks off the physical attraction right way (she‚Äôs my type). This is not the reason why I‚Äôm so intrigued in her though. We have a mutual friend, and he told me a lot about her. She‚Äôs very humble, comes from a good family, hard worker, good student, only has one social media page instagram, doesn‚Äôt post pics of herself, she‚Äôs not self centered, she doesn‚Äôt like the spotlight, doesn‚Äôt wear flashy cloths, doesn‚Äôt care about the newest things, everything you can say about a good girl. My friend describes her as a gem, and I can see why.

Last September was the first time I saw her. She works at the schools student gym with my friend. First time we talked, there wasn‚Äôt much to it, just straight business about me forgetting my student card and her giving me a pass. That same day a friend and I saw her crossing the street and my friend pointed at her and started teasing me about her, I think she saw that. Next time I saw her, as soon she saw me walking in the building she stared at me and adjusted her hair while looking at me (this might be me being delusional and reading into it to much). Then the next time I saw her when I was checking into the campus gym, she was talking to a co worker and as soon she saw me walking towards her, she completely dismissed her co worker and looked at me and said hi as I was checking in, looked me deep in the eyes as I was reaching for my card, then was very friendly and happy and gave me a thumbs up (I might be all in my head here too). 

Then, I would see her a few times out the week, one time I was talking to our mutual friend at the gym desk, I noticed she saw us talking and came near us and sat behind him to listen to what we were talking about. She didn‚Äôt say anything, she was just observing. I thought this was weird cause she did it right after she saw me talking to my friend and went out her way to sit behind him after I started talking to him.

There's a guy who she knows for years who is in love with her, but I didn't see her flirting with him. There were some signs she might be interested in me like I am interested in her. So I thought I'd just ask her out. It wasn't smooth, she initially said no then yes. She was afraid I only wanted to date her for romantic purposes, she wants to date with friendship purposes with a potential romantic outcome. After discussing for a few mins, we came to the conclusion that was my intention as well.

My friends contacted me a couple of days ago and told me they saw her flirting with him a lot (I was there as well, I never noticed it) and they told me she's just using me to take advantage of me and she wants to boost her ego. She's not open for anything but friendship, especially since it was hard to get a date (she works every single weekend). We rarely text as well, her messages aren't open enough for me to start a chat. She was pretty sick last week, so I sent her a message asking how she's doing like every 3 days.

Now I want to cancel the date because I am afraid someone is going to use me again. I've had it twice before; first was to make someone else jealous, second time was because she loved the attention. I don't want this to happen again. If I'm going out, I am afraid I'm going to ruin it because I THINK she may not be interested at all so I won't be able to have a normal conversation. My friends don't know her better than I do, in matter affect, I know her better than they do. But I may be blinded.

How to ignore these insecurities and feelings and just go out with her and see where it goes? I don't mind her seeing more guys if we date, that's pretty normal. I want to have a good time with her and find out if there is a mutual chemistry. But my 'prejudgement' is going to ruin it all even though I know very well it's bullshit.

**tl;dr**I feel like canceling a date with someone I am interested in because my friends told me this wasn't going smooth at the start and that she's flirting with another dude who is in love with her. I am scared someone is taking advantage of me for the third time, so I can't go on a date with her without worrying she is doing the same.

M20, im just going to give a short back story
Me and this girl(F20) had met, at a wedding, both had something for each other (based on how we were together at the venue) , only thing is, we're very far off from each others hometown.
I'm not those who straight up wants a relationship w the person, but atleast, I'd like to talk to her, get to know her,  because honestly, when distance is the issue, the game of patience really kicks in. This girl had shown her interest from time to time, whenever our convos got serious. It showed i mean. 
But the thing is, she is dry as hell, i get that you're bad at texting (which she mentioned) , but one can always try mending ways right? Ask how im doing, what did i do today, but nothing.

Im not a call person, yet managed to do it two three times, where there too, one time we spoke for an hour, the longest, she spoke 90% on her pets and the last 10% her friends plus got to know she believes shes an ""old school"" love types, never to mention/ask anything about me which i dont mind. 
Like dude i want to know you, and what your hobbies are and kinda expect you to ask me back, as a conversation.
other two times she said she was busy and since then i never asked her for calls.

Yes she did talk about how her dating life never moves past the ""talking stage"" to which i used our example as to why you  gotta change your ways sometimes to make things work,  and then we started to call each other but to no avail later, so thats one plus i think. 
But one can only put efforts to a limit, today i felt really frustrated that i finally liked someone after so long and genuinely wanted something out of it (dating is still far off because im yet to meet her alone and und who she is) 
I've run out of patience, and kinda losing interest. 
Idek if she's shy, thinks this is moving too fast and that shes not comfortable, which idt i even pushed her for anything like creeps do, i just dont know anything.


So my question is, 
Should i just text her today, whenever we speak about how things are just not moving ahead, how dissapointed i am for how things have come to, And that lets end this on a good note and not drag a dead conversation.
Or should i ignore the next time she texts me and ignore till its another DM thats just forgotten?
Or keep it low till we finally get to meet and clear up the air?


To summarise,
Should i text the girl after weeks of conversations w not much output out of it, slow and no excitement that its better to end this and that im sad this has come that way, plus no point carrying on a dead conversation, should i leave her next text ignored and forget about it or wait till we meet physically and clear things up.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1158900,public,self,Is the right approach?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ss896f/is_the_right_approach/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

 On the other hand, like I said, she's a great girl, she's my best friend, and my first love.  We've been dating for about 2 and a half years.  I also think about what she would suffer, because she made the mistake of telling her crazy mother that she lost her virginity to me, and her mother is doing psychological terrorism with the poor thing.  I've done things before, things like I buy her a snack, and she goes to say to her mother, all happy, and her mother says: ‚Äúgood for you to get fatter‚Äù.  And it almost always like this.  The mother has tried to kill herself before because she found out that her son is gay and was dating.
 My graduation is quite demanding, at least if I want to be a good professional (dentistry) and I don't want to be frustrated and suffering because of a relationship, as it will get in the way.

The vacation ended, I returned home from Italy, and I pretty much  knew I would never speak to this person again for several reasons,  including the fact that we live on different continents.

I  didn't contact him again and he didn't contact me either for five years  until recently. I had long deleted this guy's number. Randomly out of  the blue I got text saying ""Yes, this Tuesday at the beach.""

I recognized who it was because of the profile picture. He texted again saying it was an accident. I simply didn't reply.

Look,  it may well be that it truly was accidental. But I'm more fascinated by  why some people would keep the contact details of a random foreign  fling from years ago.

We met during high school, while I was dating one of her friends, and we got along. The relationship I had with her friend ended and then, by chance, we joined the same college, in the same city. We got really close, as we were some sort of a comfort zone for each other, and we stayed great friends throughout college. We even lived together for a year.

During that time,  I saw her as a friend with who I could have interesting conversations and feel understood. She was, and still is, really pretty and hot, but I just didn't care about that. However, things changed.

I started noticing her and her body in a night out. And now I can't stand not looking at her lips, or admire her beauty in some way while we're talking. Sometimes I lose my focus just looking into her eyes and imagining what sex would be like with her. She sends me a selfie and my heart starts beating faster.  This has been going on for a month and I'm turned on in a way that I haven't been before.

A relationship with her would be difficult, since we have very different life goals and principles. I can't realistically imagine anything other than sex with her. Plus, I don't think she's interested like that.

This makes me feel guilty, since I haven't been a great friend. When we talk, I'm picturing her undressing, and not being able to be perfectly honest with her is killing me. I just feel so inevitably attracted to her, and I don't know how this even happened. I've never dealt with such a physical crush.

How would you handle this situation? Should I tell her and ask her on a date, or ignore that it's a thing and act like nothing's happening?

TL;DR: I have an amazing friendship with a platonic friend, and suddenly I find myself very attracted towards her, but I know that a relationship isn't realistic. Should I be honest with her and tell her I have a crush or hide it and expect it goes away? Should I ask her on a date?

My past exes might have had a preference for a younger age group and i'm afraid of meeting similar people again.

Hi, I (24M) was broken up with a few years ago. I haven't had a real relationship since then and I live alone and work long hours alone as well. I can hardly find a reason to get out of bed most of the time if not for work or food. I've been in a depressive slump for the longest time and I'd like to eventually get back out there. Issue is my appearance. 

A little bit of context, me and my ex (32M) had a very simple relationship. Hardly ever went on dates, pretty much just locked ourselves in his room all day. Never really talked to eachother despite spending every moment possible with eachother. When he finally broke up with me it was because of something I had done and I accept that as a fact and I dont let that bother me too much.

I started to miss the simplicity of our relationship because I'm not really the type to be ""lovey dovey"" and what not. As i reminisced, i started to realize a weird trend with the nicknames he'd call me or the things he'd say. Always reffering to me with nicknames of childlike nature. Thinking back to past relationships, similar things were happening. Always being talked down to, patronized, given young-ish nicknames. Idk maybe i'm crazy but it was enough to get me out of the dating game for a good three years and send me to isolation.

I've always dated older men and women because i havent really started dating until college. It wasn't something I noticed until recently looking back at my exes. My relationships with people my age never advanced past hook-ups or hangouts. Also, people my age also have had no romantic interest in me, ever. So i'm afraid i attract a certain ""crowd."" 

If it puts it into perspective, pre-covid, I always got ID'd for video games and energy drinks. I'm trying to look older. Bulking and working out but my wardrobe consists of shapeless bulky clothes because I live in a colder area. The face masks helps. I've taken longer shifts at work and i've gotten a tad bit sleep deprived and the eyebags help me look older but i unfortunately still look ""14,"" according to friends, once the mask is off.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1158922,public,self,Im afraid to start dating because of my looks,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ssbxkk/im_afraid_to_start_dating_because_of_my_looks/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,

I've been his +1 to things, we've gone to dinner, we banter a lot and I have quite a flirty sense of humour, and he usually gives it back. We've done quite a lot of ""date"" activities, but as friends.

However I know he is scared of commitment. We're both very open about our dating lives and our struggles to find people- he meets up with lots of girls but doesn't feel any connection, I have had some bad experiences so struggle with hookup culture which seems to be the main way people at uni meet each other.

He's not the type I usually go for but over the last few weeks I realised I find him really quite attractive. He makes me laugh loads and even though we have very different interests, we have similar values and mindsets. So I could see us working as a couple.

He's my best friend here at uni though and I don't have that many friends... If he says no it'll probably be awkward and mess up our friendship. And I also feel like he might find wanting to risk our friendship a reason to say no... he's never dated a friend before. So I don't know if it's worth risking it.

For me I imagine that when your dating around it can take time to really get to know someone. There was maybe once within the last year where I really felt an immediate strong excitement for the person. However after so many dates they backed off and we are hardly talking. I moved on, but she hasnt closed the door, just doesnt know how she feels. Well after 6 dates and barely any communication from her for over a week I am kind of done. That would be hesitation part of it. If there was no hesitation I could have seen things taking off. But its not off the table. I dont see why maybe there are instances where people did hesitate and came back around, but her hesitation and lack of communication is enough for me to be over it. Im using that as an example I guess.   


But people describe it as an immediate first date feeling. Or first time meeting. They just  ""knew"". That kind of talk makes people less willing to go on 2nd dates maybe? Becuase I have been very willing to for 2nd or even 3rd dates even when I didnt know if I was feeling it, while many women have shot me down for not feeling a connection. to me a connection takes time to build.  


To me its sounds like a fairytale and not grounded in reality, but people say it all the time. People who are happily married. Should I really expect that?  


 I think while you might not know on the first date, or even the after 2months, at some point you will know. If not then why get married? But the immediate expectation that you will both be swept off your feet and that they'll be no hesitations seems fake to me.   


I feel like it negatively impacts the dating scene to have those type of expectations floating around.   


what are your opinions on that? Should I be more picky and hold out for more of a strong connection upfront, or are plenty of couples who took more time to feel that way?  


I had a 3hr first date with someone this weekend and really enjoyed it. I did feel chemisty and look forward to seeing her again, but at one point I thought she had ghosted me and I was able to move on without much heartbreak.

He did it again for valentines. And I stupidly fell for it. He told me almost 2 months in advance(!!) that he had already started planning for valentines.

Well. Now I‚Äôm sad because I haven‚Äôt even gotten flowers and the days almost over.

Note: he does and has gotten me flowers and stuff on regular days and isn‚Äôt a bad bf but this over-selling thing sucks.

My ex did the same thing and he was hiding the fact that he was still using tinder during our entire relationship.
