1,odw69l,1625444108,How to start dating again,"Hi all,

I had a relationship which lasted for 5 years. Unfortunately, it failed. We broke up in May 2019. 

I am ready to move on. So, I started using dating app - coffee and bagel. So far, all the dates I have gotten is just brings me to nowhere. Typically, the dates that I have gotten just seems uninterested.

Maybe I am doing something wrong. Any advice?

Should I try to meet people at places where my interests are? Or should I just pay for some professional matchmaker?

So i (20f) had a fwb situation with this guy (24m) i went on a date with a couple months back. We had been seeing each other regularly-ish for the past few weeks.

So recently he tells me he has two dates lines up which we agreed was fine and he told me he had a good feeling about one of them and he could potentially date this girl.

So my issue is that we haven‚Äôt talked in almost a week and so I‚Äôm unsure how these dates have gone and therefore unsure of where i stand as a fwb. When he mentioned going on this date, he said if it went well we would obviously stop seeing each other, which sucks but I‚Äôm prepared for it.

I need advice on how to initiate a conversation asking if we‚Äôre not seeing each other anymore as I assumed he would message me but I haven‚Äôt heard anything. I appreciate being informed and hate when I have no clue whats going on ahah (bit impatient). So how should I proceed in messaging him?

5,odwen8,1625445062,Well that was disappointing,"Went to the city last night for a couple brews. Did some axe throwing, bar hopped. 
One of the bars I went to I saw a couple girls that caught my eye. I walked up to them and started talking. My friends and I.
The first half hour it was us as a group talking, then it splintered off into one of them just talking to me. At first, I could tell she was nervous (facing perpendicular to me when talking, a lot of preening). But was able to carry a conversation.
Throughout we discovered similarities, and there were quite a few which made for really interesting and prolonged conversation, and after a while she started to warm up to me. Her body language changed, she started smiling more, asking questions about me. It began to feel less and less akin to an interview and more like genuine interest.
My one buddy took notice and I could see him giving me the thumbs up from the back of the bar.
This continued until the better part of 2am (3 hours).
Once it was time to go (I had to catch the last train) I got her number and sent her a text, telling her it was a pleasure getting to know her. She replied in kind. As a follow up, I asked if she would be interested in meeting up again. 
To which she never gave a straight answer, and from there the text conversation flatlined. 
Overall a small victory. I was able to approach women at a bar without fear of rejection, but ultimately a pretty disappointing end. Not looking to throw a pity party but Christ that was a lot of work for it to flatline so soon.

Some additional background: 

I‚Äôm looking for a relationship, not a fling.
She‚Äôs from another city approx a couple hours away and was here visiting her cousin. I not sure if that really factored into her response.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/odwen8/well_that_was_disappointing/
6,odwja5,1625445600,Ethnic/non-Caucasian men are racist toward their own women.,"I‚Äôm middle eastern (Persian) and almost all the Persian guys I find attractive and within my league, are into white American girls. All their exes are white, their current gfs are white and future gfs and maybe possible wives will also be white. I‚Äôm talking very attractive LA model-like white girls. 

A (Persian) gf of mine has had the same experience. One guy straight up even told her on a date ‚ÄúI‚Äôm into blondes‚Äù. She‚Äôs not a blonde....

The type of Persian men that like to date and marry Persian women are the ones that recently moved to the US - like after graduating college or if they came here for an advanced degree or something. They‚Äôre still SUPER cultured and would prefer to date within because they wouldn‚Äôt have much in common with a non-Persian. The problem is that I DON‚ÄôT have much in common with those men. Because, yes, although I am Persian myself and speak Farsi, I was born and raised here and grew up pretty American but of course I don‚Äôt identify as a full blown American either, like I for sure have some traditional ways that relate to my culture. So I always viewed my ideal match as someone who‚Äôs the same as me. Persian-American, born and raised here and has a good balance of both sides, but like I said, those guys are into American white girls. 

Now I‚Äôve seen this in other cultures too. I dated a Punjabi guy for a few years. He was very handsome but this guy had such a bizarre prejudice toward Indian women, like he almost despised them and I never understood why. He had never dated or even entertained the idea of being with an Indian women. And when I would ask him why, he‚Äôd say I‚Äôm just not attracted to them. He would say I‚Äôm into Persian/Lebanese girls for dating and serious relationships and white girls for casual hook ups. 

He also creepily idolized ‚Äúfamous‚Äù Persian women on social media, women like Leyla Milani. Like that was his idea of a perfect wife. 

So this experience made me think well.... damn this all makes sense. This is why all the Persian guys I‚Äôm into like white girls. It seems like these types of guys just want to go west from themselves. It‚Äôs like an ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù. And it‚Äôs all for superficial AND RACIST reasons. 

Oh I almost forgot I have another example. I have another gf who is from Azerbaijan and she has the same problem with Azeri men. Apparently they‚Äôre really into Russian girls (because of the invasion and all). She was telling me all about her problems with dating Azeri men because they prefer the typical blonde haired, blue eyed Russian look (again superficial reasons) and I was like hah! I can relate. 

I‚Äôm not sure if this applies to other cultures/races as well. But if yes, please share. 

Some cultures I DONT see this in often include: Jewish communities, Armenians, and Christian Arabs. These cultures actually prefer to date and marry within and keep their lineage going, and as someone who‚Äôs a minority in the US I really admire that mentality.

PS: if any white women are reading this, please don‚Äôt take this wrong way, but if you‚Äôre dating a middle eastern/south asian man, chances are he‚Äôs with you for the wrong reasons. Obviously not all, but definitely most. I cannot comment on men of other ethnicities (for ex. Black, Hispanic, East Asian, etc.) however, and their motives as I am not familiar.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/odwja5/ethnicnoncaucasian_men_are_racist_toward_their/

his heart was beating so fast, his palms were all sweaty, and he was breathing hard so i knew he was nervous haha. i loved stroking his neck or jaw or playing with his hair to hear his heart beat faster, it was so cute!

at the mall, we got some sushi and chicken teriyaki at the food court and then walked around the mall for a while. eventually, we decided to go to the arcade and spent about $20 on coins without getting any tickets haha. it was still a lot of fun hanging out together, and trying to get each other a stuffed animal from the claw machines! he also kept saying how glad he was that he asked me out :)

we also went into barnes&amp;noble to look at some books and figurines. any time we were away from people, he would pull me aside and hug me... my heart exploded! he's absolutely the cutest! at some point, walking past the food court- some teenagers were sitting together and a boy pointed at one of his girl friends and said ""hey, she wants your number!"" and he pointed to either me or the guy i was on the date with (probably him)- so we just laughed it off and walked away.

anyways, after we both head home, im talking to him on the phone and he suddenly says ""i love you, my beautiful boy"" (he still insists on telling me he loves me and is okay with me not being ready to say it back yet) AND THIS ALMOST MADE ME CRYYY- for those who didnt see my previous post, i met him about 3 years ago in a club at our local library and he said he's had a crush on me ever since we met, but hadnt made any moves up until now. and im a trans guy who came out to him recently after finding out he was straight. well, about an hour or two ago he told me he's actually bi! i dont know if he just lied that he was straight (which i dont know why he would, because he already knew i was pan so i obviously support LGBT people) or if he started calling himself bi after i came out as a guy. either way, im so lucky to be with him!

tuesday, he's gonna come hang out at my house, and then we're going to a meeting together at our nerd club around 6:30. if all goes well, ill post about that too! ahh, im so excited!!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/odwu2b/amazing_second_date/
11,odwx3y,1625447177,[19] bad string of events led me to 0 self confidence,"Ok so this is going to be long but I just want to let some things out:

So it all started when I was 17, I was in a relationship with this girl for a year and a few months, when we broke up it really broke my ego if thats a good way to put it. She was super loving, obsessed with me, absolutely crazy for me always calling me handsome, cute, etc etc. But when we broke up I tried getting her back and she switched her whole personality on me. And it really messed me up mentally. After that I got onto nofap, quit vaping, started working out, got a really nice physique, a job, and a healthy lifestyle. But ever since that relationship I feel like I've lost my spunk if you will. I've gotten more awkward talking to girls, I overthink things, and I almost try to win them over. After my breakup this resulted in having hookups with pretty much any girl I could get, and a few of them I do regret to a certain degree. Fast forward I turned 19 and met this girl on a day out in town and I got her number and we hit it off. She was the first girl to really show interest after my ex and I was enthralled. We hung out every other day, watched movies, went on walks, even slept over at both our places (I still live with my mom, don't know why I added that but I feel as if it's necessary). But I knew in the back of my mind I was never 100% comfortable with her... Like I felt like she was going to leave me because of a certain flaw and I always tried to be more funny then I am, tried to act a certain way... Idk. We've known eachother for about a month and she progressively lost interest and she said we could end it if i wanted so I did to preserve any little bit of dignity I had left. That was 2 months ago. But what I'm trying to say is that really messed with my confidence. I feel like I just come off as too strong with every girl I meet and I know i'm doing it and I know it's cringey when I see others doing it but I can't help it I always do it.

13,odx6vm,1625448372,Maintaining contact before meeting this girl?,"Ok so I asked a question about this situation several days ago about possibly meeting up with this girl. Below is the background:

***

Been in the program since the start of the year and there‚Äôs this girl I met that seems really cool.

She initially reached out months ago for help on an assignment and since then we‚Äôve kept close contact. We‚Äôve talked about assignments and even had our own zoom sessions just one on one talking for an hour. We talk about school, future plans, personal interests etc.

Normally we messaged through our programs slack channel but two weeks ago she asked for my number, saying she doesn‚Äôt get slack notifications sometimes.

***

Now, the program is over but our class will be meeting up in about two weeks. However, I‚Äôm left wondering if I should still text her/call her during this time? I‚Äôm still unsure if she likes me. 

She doesn‚Äôt initiate contact that much(which is why I‚Äôm unsure if she likes me), only when she needed help. On the contrary, whenever I did/do reach out, she always responds either right away or in a reasonable time. The few times I‚Äôve called her, we talked for a bit. She did seem excited to meet me, so there‚Äôs that.

Should I call her/text her randomly or just not make any contact at all and wait for that meetup?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/odx6vm/maintaining_contact_before_meeting_this_girl/

22,odxlor,1625450190,I'm thinking of changing my name to Franky Friend-zone. Anyone else find themselves in a similar situation more often than not?,"[Here are my two most recent submissions!](https://imgur.com/a/Ow1cmd5)

I'll preface this by saying that I do appreciate when a woman I've been seeing casually let's me know they don't see potential for a romantic connection sooner rather than later; however, I find myself more and more wondering what sort relationship killing vibe am I giving off?

Even when the offer for feedback is given, and I take them up on it, it just boils down to 'lack of chemistry'. Which is totally valid, but also almost completely unhelpful. I'm apparently a wicked awesome guy and fun enough to be around that being friends appears to be a genuine offer on the table (I mean, hopefully that's not used as a conciliation prize and there's an actual interest in enjoying my company).

I think the hardest part for me is that the two examples I've posted represent months of getting to know someone and genuinely putting in real effort. I'm interesting on paper enough to match. And interesting enough to see in person a few times; however, it just doesn't lead anywhere. Which ultimately is fine, I know I'm (obviously) not going to click with every woman I talk to, but damn! It definitely gets a bit disheartening, especially because I have a busy schedule and really can't make plans with more than one woman at a time and actually give them my full attention. 

And these are the woman I actually manage to make in person contact with, haha. There are dozens of dead chats littering my inboxes where it never made it past a handful of messages not to mention probably hundreds of 'likes' and intros I've made that don't even get a response.

Anyway, now my thoughts are wandering.

Anyone else with similar experiences? Do you dust yourselves off and try again, and again?

So I was so so lonely when I moved here. I have no friends anywhere near me. I have no family. I was pretty depressed. And she basically gets upset with me about it and goes ""it's not all about you. We are all dealing with stuff"" because I wasn't chipper and positive. 
So since then I've done every stupid thing in my power to be positive and nice and not behave in a way that shows I'm sad or anything around her.

29,ody1p2,1625452126,Dating advice from my bad experiences,"Feel free to ignore any or all of this, but I was thinking in the car earlier and figured I might share some advice. So, here is some random advice I feel like I could have used years ago:  


* If someone doesn't make themselves available, they do not reply, they do not message you first, they do not make attempts to see you, they are simply not interested enough to make them worth your time. If a girl wants to see you once a week, run away. 
* If a girl tells you, it's not going to work, do not try to reason with her. Logic will never work in this realm, as most of the time the person isn't working off logic. Just walk away. Don't beg, don't plead, don't try to change yourself to be ""better"" for them or their situation, as it will never work long term. If a girl is wishy-washy, cannot make her mind up if she wants to be with you, she does not. Be nice and tell her you are worthy of someone who isn't all over the map. If it's her past that has her messed up on this, you're not going to fix her anyhow, so it's not going to work long term. 
* Always have your own self-respect. Don't tell a girl how much you love her or need her if she suddenly isn't sure about your rship. You don't want to look back and read old texts and think, ""why was I so weak? Being this way got me nowhere with her, and she can look back and think about what a beta male you were."" I say this as a sappy, romantic, sentimental dude who always makes this mistake. I look back, and I am grossed out by this ""man"" acting like a wimp.
* There will literally always be more fish in the sea. If a girl isn't all about you, move onto a girl who will be. Do not think of staying with someone because you'd rather be with a C+ than a lone. In the long run, you will only hate yourself for being a wimp and not standing up for yourself. It will affect your self-esteem long term if you can't stand up for you. You are worthy of someone cool unless you're a total asshole, but you're not, so don't let her treat you like one.
* Do not spend a ton of money on a girl early on. If she bails when the funds run dry, you are left with heartbreak and a hell of a lot less money than before. 
* Do not be overly nice. Your heart will tell you you want to say sweet things to her, make her feel like a queen, but most girls will take advantage of that, know you are likely a sentimental sucker and use that to hurt you. Be aloof sometimes. Do not overshare what is in your heart too early. And do NOT say I love you until you are 100% sure...this will almost surely take numerous months to build legit, and saying I love you too early (before she does) will scare her, or if she says it first and you reply, it will mean she knows she can use that to her advantage. Guys have it worse...a girl can go out and easily find 10 men tomorrow. A dude has to be suave as shit and addled with confidence to maybe find 1 woman a week from now. 
* If a girl breaks up with you via text, she's an asshole. If she comes back later that day saying she misses you, has been crying all day, etc. tell her to go to hell. Well, don't. Just politely tell her that dumping you via text is what a terrible person does, and you want to meet someone who isn't terrible. You had fun, and you are sorry she made this decision, but it WAS her decision ultimately. Just walk away. 
* If a girl is casually attacking stuff like your clothes, your hair, your skin, etc. tell her to cut it out or walk away. Especially if you aren't finding faults in her. Someone who truly loves you isn't going to attack these things, and sometimes a woman will attack these things because you have shown her you will take it and she knows she can mess with you that way.

Just some general advice. Mostly stuff I came away with from my last rship with a selfish, self-centered, very confused lady who ultimately did not care about me and knew she could do whatever she wanted and I would take it. Don't be like me, basically :) 

I thought myself unworthy of love because of some of the stuff she said, the way she treated me, her constantly being wishy-washy from day-to-day. Until I talked to her ex and found out she basically did all the same stuff to him, and it was not me, but rather it was her with the issue. There are other women out there (or men), and you have to be confident in your own view of yourself. You cannot have a good view of your own self if you are letting a girl walk all over you, or if you so easily let her come back over and over again when she can't decide if you are worthy of her love or not. If she cannot decide now if you are worthy, she definitely won't know a year from now. This is someone who will walk away at some point in the future, why fall deeper for her knowing that? 

Hopefully, these generic pieces of advice are helpful. They sound so easy, but your heart will not see them when you are in the thick of it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ody1p2/dating_advice_from_my_bad_experiences/

34,ody895,1625452895,Be honest in dating and relationship," We go on a date, we get to know each other by communicating with each other so that we know who they are and the other person knows who we are. But if we hide our real self about what we want, what we believe, what we think just for the sake of the other person's expectation or attraction toward us- we will create a mistake that we might unable to avoid in the future with them. We create a false image of ourselves in front of the other person because we think they may not accept the real us, and so we keep on becoming the illusion that they see and think about us. But that would damage us when we realize we cannot continue in a relationship with the other person without being ourselves. We realize that we cannot maintain living up to their expectation about ourselves. And it was too late when we realize, they are not the right ones for us all along.   
We should be true to ourselves rather than chasing the idea of getting attraction from others by not being true to ourselves. Putting ourselves first is not necessarily selfish; it is self-love.   
There is a difference between being true to yourself and being selfish. Being selfish is about focusing on yourself and not caring about others. Everything that you do is only for your own good for the purpose of receiving, not giving. On the other hand, being true to yourself is knowing, understanding, accepting who you really are, and what you desire/want for yourself while at the same time caring for others. You can be true to yourself without being selfish. You can be giving and receiving. There will always be a compromise in a relationship where people accept each other for their true colors, and at the same time, accept to help and improve each other on some parts of themselves that can be changed.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ody895/be_honest_in_dating_and_relationship/

We never had the talk about what were looking for in tinder, but I know that many people use the app to make friends during the pandemic and I have the feeling that he might be one of those guys. (Unfortunately, I‚Äôm not)

Despite the fact of not knowing his intentions, I developed a crush for him, but at the same time, his behavior is so erratic that I get mixed signals all the time. I usually feel anxious and disappointed when this happens. I‚Äôm tired of feeling like this so I‚Äôve been thinking about being honest about my feelings.

I do not want to persue a romantic relationship with him, but at the same time, I like his company and I would definitely enjoy and appreciate his presence as a friend.

39,odyjq4,1625454266,I found my person!,"I just wanted to share that my boyfriend (32m) and I (28f) of 6 months, while spending the holiday weekend with all our favorite friends smoking weed, playing volleyball, cornhole, swimming, camping and drinking around the fire, said we love each other! The moment felt so right and perfect and both of us wanted to say it for a while but wanted it to feel like the right time.

I dated someone for 2 years back when I was 19-20 and then another guy for 3.5 years when I was 22-25. I felt what I thought was love for them at the time because I didn't know myself well enough to know what kind of partner was right for me or what love should feel like. I broke it off with both of them because neither of them felt... right or like someone I wanted to be with forever despite both of them wanting to marry me.

I didn't realize what I felt before with my exes wasn't actual love, just a desire to be with someone... until I met my current boyfriend. He is definitely my person, soulmate, best friend, the love of my life and he feels the same way towards me. He makes me laugh constantly with his dumb ass hilarious dad jokes (and raunchy jokes), cares about my life, wants to take care of me, makes sure I'm safe, gives me the corniest and best compliments all of the time while reminding me how lucky he is to have me and how sexy he thinks I am, is so physically affectionate towards me in all the right ways (tender or rough when I need it), doesn't care who sees us being silly with our dorky inside jokes or pda, shows me off to all his friends and family, has met mine and LOVES them! He's active and wants to go do stuff, so positive, such a genuine person, a massive dork, has so many of the same hobbies plus is teaching me new ones and putting interest in mine! 

Ugh I am so smitten with this guy. I just wanted to share because after I dated my first two exes when I was younger, I spent a lot of time struggling to find someone that I really connected with. I did the whole online dating thing, had friends set me up with people and I just honestly felt like I would never feel ""love"" again and might have to settle for someone. It just felt so forced and fake and I felt numb inside constantly thinking about finding someone... so I took a step back from dating to be single and find myself.

I picked up a few new social hobbies that I'm obsessed with now and that's when I found him. I had a massive crush on this guy from the beginning, I don't know how it happened because I don't get crushes often but his personality is so fucking attractive. Way too much confidence in himself, in a cocky way but you can tell he's just trying to be funny. It was like a wave hit me and I even told my best friend about him early on. Of course I'm dumb and didn't act on it right away so we got to become friends, with the whole fun, flirty banter. I knew he was into me because he took time to ask me about myself and flirt with me any and every time I saw him. Fuck I was so into him but it took him 4 months before he told me he had a massive crush on me from the beginning too and knew if we dated he'd fall for me hard (like a puppy dog). Of course I said yes to going out with him and he's been the best decision. Jesus I know, I'm almost 30 and giddy writing this. He makes me feel like we are the only people in a crowded room. I don't even notice other guys anymore...

I do believe that you can find someone from online dating, my brother did and he's in a great marriage with a kid and another on the way. But what I wanted was a best friend that I could do everything with, someone that is as obsessed with me as I am with him (not in a clingy way but in a fun, loving, I'll always have your back way). I wasn't going to settle for someone random I met online or through friends just because they also wanted to settle down and get married or just because I wanted a companion. We trust each other and want the best for each other, encourage and cheer each other on. I know being single can be tough and I'm sure someone will comment and say ""must be nice"" or whatever which I get because I was there for the last 4 years... but don't just pick the first person that says yes to you. Find someone that likes you just as as much as you like them because even though it took me 28 years to get to him and a lot of rough dates, crying and questioning myself and if I was even good enough for my ""perfect"" person, I found him and I'm not letting him go!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/odyjq4/i_found_my_person/

42,odymac,1625454570,Meeting older women?,"Hi, unconventional post here, but hear me out. After all, this is the most populated (relevant) sub and I'd like some specific advice.

18 (M) and been thinking about this after some abysmal ordeals with women in my age group. I'd like to bury all of that in the past for now and divert myself with something different. I'm regarded as a sensible and reasonably mature person for my age and have few problems holding meaningful conversations with those older than myself, other than perhaps being on the introverted side. I have varied interests so I can generally find something to talk about.

I tried Tinder in the recent past (for a week or so) and found it to be incredibly oversaturated with men on the whole. There seems to be a consensus among other men online that with the staggering ratio of men to women on most major OLD platforms (particularly Tinder) that without being Adonis in the flesh, you stand very little chance of being successful. Indeed, I had no matches on Tinder and only two on Bumble, where the girls never seem interested in making advances (I got a 'Hi' from one and that was it).

I'd say my photos are reasonable (good lighting and dress, inconspicuous backgrounds) and I have detailed and accurate bios. I work to strike a balance between an outgoing and thoughtful persona. Particularly, my openings in conversations are nearly always as imaginative as possible (with some wit) to distinguish myself from the hordes of insipid one-liners these women doubtless receive. This has made no difference, and I'm not convinced clearing these hurdles does much in general.

I've heard OkCupid is quite favourable for meeting mature women, but I still had 0 matches and only a couple likes in the few days I was active, even though I answered dozens of questions. I have since uninstalled the app, although my profile is still up, and I receive alerts by email, so I can confirm there has been no progress since then.

My suspicion is that young(ish) women, in general, prefer to date older men, rather than younger or even those of the same age, and generally won't touch teenagers. To worsen matters, OLD provides an unrealistic degree of choice, so I'd expect them to become even more selective. I have heard it directly that they find teens and early-twenties suitors either too ""immature"", or that there isn't enough common ground to warrant the effort. In all honesty, I can understand the perspective despite (naturally) disagreeing.

Obviously though, it would be disappointing to have never had a chance, essentially because of a stereotype. I think I could make a case for myself despite my relatively ordinary looks (at best) if I were able to scale this wall.

Unfortunately, I'm beginning to think this may not be possible, particularly within my preferred age group (26-35, roughly). Does anyone have any ideas, outside the usual tips? To clarify, I'm not looking for a hookup, I'd prefer a relationship, although obviously I'm not very likely to be settling down. I don't drink so I'd be pretty out of place in a bar/pub. Also, moving off OLD isn't really practical for several reasons, at least for now.

On the whole, I'd say I'm quite serious about giving this a shot. Honestly, I'm not at all interested in putting myself out there for girls my age, it just doesn't appeal anymore. I strongly doubt this will change in the near future. Personally, the idea of coming across someone who actually knows their way around these things, can make the other person feel at ease, and stimulate some more interesting dialogue, seems too good to turn down. I'm sure someone somewhere else has felt the same way.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/odymac/meeting_older_women/

(you can check my post history, mental health issues, abusive psychopath parents, abandoned as child etc etc I got dealt a very shitty card at birth)

I was all over the apps any app that exist out there I betcha I have tried it!

&amp;#x200B;

all I kept getting were people who wanted casual sex. And I grew so frustrated and upset! and sometimes I gave in and had casual  sex, actually most of the times because I thought sex was love in my traumatized ptsd brain!  


my friends and mentors suggested the same advice over and over - forget about dating LOVE YOURSELF FIRST - I lurked here for years and saw you guys repeat the same advice ad nauseaum to many people who sounded like me LOVE YOURSELF FORGET ABOUT DATING YOU NEED TO LOVE YOURSELF FIRST!  


I did not get that at all. I hated everyone who told me that advice it was meaningless and frustrating to me!!! How dare you tell me I am not normal for not wanting to be lonely and alone and isolated! Humans need connection and love to feel okay! how dare you tell me I am not worthy of that because I dont love myself enough!

So frustrated so tired. And I kept trying and trying and trying to date and date till I just broke and gave up.   


That was the turning point. I went out one night at 3 am for a drink and while walking back it was a full moon night and the stars were out (which is very weird for a north american big city with light pollution let me tell you) and Just threw my hands up and looked at the sky and said ""F-CK YOU GOD. IF you want me to die alone then I accept and I am no longer am Afraid  of it. I will die alone man. I will marry my own goddamn self if I have to I am so tired of looking and searching for the one and I am not even sure he exist!""

So I gave up and quit dating cold turkey like everyone who loved me was suggesting even though I was salty about it. 

I realized I am my number one priority if I dont love me then nothing really matters. 

It was covid and it was very easy to isolate so I intentionally did so and boy did I cry and scream and sob and kick things in my empty apartment!  


I attened two therapy sessions a week for one year. And talked to no one else for months and months on an end. 

I picked up new skills relearned my passion for reading and writing. Attended support groups on zoom whenever I could. Started meditating and deep diving into spirituality and read spiritual books and self help books as much as I could! 

I went hiking alone, meditated in the forrest or park alone. I ordered uber eats from a fancy restaurant put on netflix and some candles and flowers and took myself to dates! I bought nice gifts to myself from amazon! I even bought myself a nice white gold ring with amethyst and diamons and put it on my ring finger and imagined and affirmed I was married to myself!

&amp;#x200B;

I picked up new skills and certificates through online school!  


And then slowly lockdown lifted a bit and I eventually started hanging out with people again. Not in dating settings just socially!

I always remembered many of my mentors saying get off the apps try to meet someone organically! And I wasnt interested in meeting anyone yet but I kept that in mind and started going out and chilling with people!

I met my current partner in a random tantra class he was hosting as a facilitator that I got invited to. He introduced himself as a gay man but said hes been considering being with women and he's been with women before and liked it and he's open to it now. and I didnt think of it much really. I am bisexual myself so I didnt care what his orientation was. I wasnt exactly attracted to him right away. I thought he was gay so I didnt really consider him an option. But he was leading people into guided tantra exercises and what not and we hung out and chilled and as a facilitator of a workshop that is very emotional for some people he offered free therapy basically to the clients and I took him up. And he gave me very nice hugs and I stayed over the centre where it was being held and he made sure I was comfortable. But I noticed all night he was making very sexual pointed jokes with me. Which was interesting coming from a ""gay"" man I should say now...  


anyway fast forwards six months later we got very close friends and regularly slept over at each others houses with no sex involved. Still thought he was gay honestly.....anyway he admits one night hes attracted to me physically. I fell from the sky and had a heart attack. But truth be told I had always found him attractive too.  


we took it very slow waited a long time to have sex and got to know each other carefully!  


Sexual connection turned out to be amazing ( I mean he teaches people tantric sex professionally lol I got very lucky) and we are now very committed to each other and engaged and have introduced each other to our families and are buying a house together soon etc etc!

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I just got lucky! I feel very lucky!

&amp;#x200B;

but I listened to the advice often given on this sub and it worked! WORK ON YOUR FUCKING SELF LEARN TO BE ALONE WITH YOURSELF AND LOVE YOURSELF BEFORE YOU START DATING!

&amp;#x200B;

# TL: DR:  Read this sub for years noticed the advice was to always learn to love yourself before you start dating I didnt believe you guys and I suffered for a few more years till I fucking gave up and tried to do it and it kinda worked and I got engaged very soon after later!

48,odyvh2,1625455667,Is she into me or is she just being nice?,"Phase 1: So there's this girl that I know in person and she's usually shy around me when I see her or talk with her. So I haven't seen this girl in about a year and I saw her on instagram and followed her. She gave me her number because she said it's easier to communicate through there than on snap chat for her. And every time I hit her up she was usually to busy to hangout. 

Phase 2: I wasn't too much into her at first initially, but I just wanted to check up on an old friend. I invited her to a lot of group stuff to hang and she usually wasn't able too. Her brother kept telling me she wants to hang out at my place to swim and to get together, but she was usually busy....which sounds legit. After a month of not hanging out with me and a group of people. I came over too her house after a workout with her brother. First off I am good friends with her brother and he didn't seem to mind us going out or liking each other in the past. I've known her for a while and we had a thing in the past, but never hit it off until a bit now. Anyways my friend left us two at the dinner table and it was a bit awkward because it was the first time seeing each other after a year. She gave me every sign in the book that she liked me. Maintaining eye contact, doing the shy smile, and etc. After we talked a bit, we went inside to put the dishes away, and she would do little things like poking me in the back or placing her hand on mine. 

Her brother was getting a shower and  I decided to walk up to his door and say good bye before I left. After I did, she wanted to show me her room and we peaked in there and laughed. We talked a bit longer and then she walked me out and it seemed like everything went well and that we had really good chemistry together. 

Phase 3: Later that week my friend and I wanted to go to an amusement park, but apparently no one could go and we couldn't get a group. I told her the plans were cancelled, but decided to say to her that her and I can go together still. She took a good while to respond and didn't really respond until the next day. She said, ""okiee dokiee."" and I was pretty excited that she said so. The day before we were supposed to go, I told her I would pick her up around 5 to 5:15. She responded after an hour or two and said okay, but seconds later her brother texts me and says he's coming to the park with us now. I was kind of shocked and starting laughing about it and he told me to bring my brother and sister so it isn't awkward. 

So we went to the park and we all had a good time except for the girl and her brother who kept fighting, I just made sure to keep my distance. And she was annoyed with her brother a lot because he would poke her and say you should sit with him on the ride and her brothers friend said the same thing. So they knew she liked me a bit and I decided to keep my distance a lot because I could tell things were not going to well. Later after she calmed down and her brother and his friend went a different path in the park, she kept finding ways to touch me and I gave her signal by touching her on the back and talking in her ear and she seemed cool about it. After the whole park thing it seemed like everything went well. 

Phase 4: I know I keep blabbering and I'm almost to the point and problem, just a bit further. The next day I told her that I'm having a party in a day and I hope to see her there. And her brother was supposed to come as well with many others. She told me she couldn't make it because she was going to another party with her friends, but said we should plan something soon. 

The Problem: She never texts me first and always takes a long time to respond to anything I say. Before when I asked her to hang in a group she would respond within the ten minutes to an hour. But ever since I came over to eat for dinner, she started taking longer to respond and where she wouldn't respond for a day. But she always did respond, but not in the time that I may hope for. She also only uses her phone 3 hours a day because she said she wants to live in the real world which is a great thing! I'm always the one to text first and the one to see if she wants to hang and I don't really care for texting on the phone. 

The main problem is that I've seen girls do this with me in the past, where they are flirty and trying to get closer to me. But in the end it was just for validation for the girls to make them feel good. 

Am I wasting my time here? Are these good signs she likes me? Did she invite her brother to the park with us because she felt awkward? Or did he come because he found out some how? Is it a good sign she wants to get together again, or is she just being nice? And why doesn't she text me first?

Sorry for such a long story, but it wasn't something you couldn't sum up lol. Please give me some tips on if I should keep pursuing or if I should wait for her to text me or to text her to hangout again.

Ok so when I was 16 I saw this girl at a huge church activity, she was talking to someone and we locked eyes, I knew she was looking directly at me.

After that I never got her name or anything for about 4 years but a couple months ago by chance of fate, I saw her profile on Instagram and I added her. She is truly one of the prettiest girls I've ever seen. Never talked to her until yesterday.

Today I Finally asked her out: nothing fancy, just some ice cream to start getting to know each other. Does any of you have any advice?

Just wanted to post here bc I have no one else to share this with. She hasn't seen her IG in 4 hours so she hasn't heard my voice note, but honestly, I'm just glad I finally had the balls to ask her out.

55,odzgeu,1625458158,I know this is long but please read:,"I (26F) met this guy (32M) on bumble. Even talking to him within the first few days I noticed there were some pink flags (he was calling me baby girl, laying it on thick, etc) but I brushed it off. We started texting and I almost let it fizzle out before he hit me back up with a smooth text. It was my mom who convinced me to give him a shot (ha!). So we text a bit and I agree to go on this date with him at a mexican joint, but it wasn‚Äôt even until 9pm. Again I notice pink flags but I‚Äôm simultaneously digging him. We agree to go out again. Second date is great. He‚Äôs an aspiring musician here is Nashville so he takes me to this place he sometimes plays at and gives me my very own concert in the parking lot where people are coming out and listening, clapping. It was like a scene from a movie! But‚Ä¶ here is where a red flag occurs: he convinced me to go back to his place where he says he‚Äôs gonna make us a fire in his fire pit out back- none of that happens lol he falls asleep on me. I leave and the next morning he texts me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry I understand if you never want to talk to me again etc.‚Äù But something left me forgiving him. So we progress in our dating. Next few months are great. He calls me every day, multiple times a day. Lots of texts. Seems very attentive. But there was one weird thing.. He didn‚Äôt want me following him on instagram? He said he would follow me when ‚ÄúHe knows I‚Äôm the right one‚Äù. But he has over 4,000 followers and isn‚Äôt even private so Im like?? wtf. I also start to notice sometimes he can be a little harsh. I chalk it up to long days at work and these health issues he‚Äôs going through. He even had a surgery which he told the hospital I was his girlfriend and they called me to come help with his discharge. Everything felt like we were headed in the right direction. About a month ago I was feeling like I didn‚Äôt know what we were. I was getting asked out at the gym so I had a conversation about if we were seeing other people. He said no, he only wants to be with me, etc. I was thrilled thinking I had a boyfriend. I added him on instagram even though he wasn‚Äôt keen on it because- don‚Äôt be a weirdo now we are exclusive so why can‚Äôt I follow you on instagram? He follows me back and we joke about it. But last Sunday we go on a date and he cuts it short after about 30 min. Weird dinner, he didn‚Äôt even eat, acted super off, etc. I call him after I get home to see if he was okay because he seemed off. He popped off saying of course he wasn‚Äôt okay because he was going through so many medical issues and I should have known that, blah blah blah. Then he said that‚Äôs why he was so bad at relationships right now and he could end it with me right then and there if he wanted/he didn‚Äôt care. He said I wasn‚Äôt understanding of his last few relationships not working out (which he says is in part due to social media and me following him on instagram was me not being understanding). I was crushed. Then he hangs up. I noticed though it sounded like he was driving somewhere during that call. And I remember on bumble you can see a match‚Äôs location (granted they‚Äôre using the app). I noticed his location said he was downtown all night. Which means 1. He was using the app still, and 2. He was somewhere downtown. Fast forward to this weekend: Friday night and Saturday are amazing. We flirt, laugh, have a great time. But tonight it‚Äôs freaking 4th of July and I‚Äôm home alone writing all this out. Because he calls me and says he‚Äôs ‚Äúwriting music tonight‚Äù but of course I check the bumble app and his location says he‚Äôs downtown. Am I tripping? Should I trust bumble location as much as I do? Or do I give him the benefit of the doubt and believe he‚Äôs actually working on music. Maybe he is? But then again, he‚Äôs also still clearly using the bumble app lmao and it‚Äôs not like I can even approach him about that. What would you do in this situation? And be kind. I just want to find my Mr. Right. And I think I know the answer as much as you do.

We text somewhat regularly but after a while it seems forced, and ends up being the same ""how's your day going"" kind of convo. Our convos irl are always smooth flowing but over text it never really feels the same (both of us aren't the best texters to be fair)

I really like him and I had years to feel like this for someone and spend so much time with time. The only thing that I‚Äôve noticed is that he has some trust issues and insecurities. We live in a town that most ppl know each other and about their lives and from the start he wanted to know with which guys I‚Äôve dated from our town specifically. I don‚Äôt know why but he has an issue with that. 

I‚Äôve never had a lot of relationships and dates here but the only guy that I feel bad for dating is one specific guy , that I was dating like 6 years ago. He is a bad person in many ways and an idiot. I was younger and I made a mistake . So I told him about everyone else but not about him bc I felt kind of ashamed for that , even though I have nothing to do with this guy anymore. 

Today during a convo he referred to him , because his brother‚Äôs girlfriend had also a relationship with this guy and this guy and his friends have spread lies about her and they reached his brother ears and now everyone is upset. And when I heard about him I don‚Äôt know what came over me and I told him that we have a past. At first I told him that we just had went on a date but after some pressure I told him that I also had sex with him. And that‚Äôs when he broke down. 

He told me that something broke inside him bc I lied to him about the guys that I‚Äôve dated and had sex from our town and also this guy is a horrible person that spreads lies about everyone and treats women horribly and bad and a lot of my bfs friends hang out with him and they will talk about me and he will feel like an idiot now. He cares about his image and he is a serious guy and he told me that now he feels that I broke his trust and he is going to have serious trust issues. He feels betrayed and that I lied to him all this time and that I told him the hard way the truth.

I had a serious breakdown and I feel ashamed that he saw me breakdown in front of him and cry like a baby bc I didn‚Äôt know how to react. He also spoke a bit harsh to me out of the blue. I called my mother in the middle of the night that this happened literally in tears and she came with my father to pick me up without me telling them . They told me to not lose my dignity and stay there crying and beg him. I spoke to him on the phone right now and he told me the same thing .

This girl I've been dating (not exclusively but 3 dates now) has been contradicting herself and it's making my head spin. We had our last date Friday and it was great. The more time I spend with her, the most chemistry I think we have. She's fun to be around and I see potential with her. 

She commented heart faces on my most recent Instagram post, FaceTimes me, texts me wishing a good day in the morning when she knows I'm stressed or have a lot in my mind, and has gone the extra mile to show she cares about me. 

I made another post earlier in the day outlining something she did the night after or date friday. Basically she posted a video of her grinding on another guy &amp; when I saw it I replied and she said ""wya"". 

She told me Friday that she was bored of drinking and yet she goes out continuously and get sh*tcanned almost every day of the weekend from dusk to dawn. This doesn't bother me, I just find it off that she blatantly contradicts herself like that. She talks a lot of trash about the people she hangs out with (guys and girls), yet still hangs with the same crowd who apparently drag her down and do things that she doesn't like. 

I know this because she told me on Friday. Yeah, she not my exclusive girlfriend but I worry about this sometimes. Her friend group is definitely not my crowd and one concern I have is if we dated how I would mesh with her people.

The grinding video definitely made me a little upset. Not that she did something wrong (we aren't exclusive), but after seeing that literally the night after going on a date with her, was not a good feeling. 

I plan on messaging her tomorrow, I have a message typed out. It basically outlines how i enjoyed our last date, want to continue to feel this out and see where it goes, but seeing that video made me question what's going on and how she feels. I also just want to ask to hear her out from her perspective. Is this a good game plan?

77,oe1sgm,1625468611,Privileged date gets to take a bus.,"Went on a date, thought I'd try something a bit different. Saw that we were having a renaissance festival, figured that was different. I had never been to one so kinda thought would be like that restaurant in texas where medieval knights fight. It wasnt exactly that thought they did have cool jousting.

   The entire time my date complains, ""it's too hot ( it was 80 degrees Fahrenheit and had a cool breeze.), why would you take me here, this is stupid, etc etc. So I offered to go elsewhere and asked what she would like to do instead. Of course the answer i got was , I Don't know.  So decided would go to a local mall, get tickets for a movie and then play at the arcade or mini golf to kill time till starts. 

  Instead of playing air hockey or racing me or something while we waited. She sat and texted, and ignored me. Eventually the movie was about to start and I said I was going to use the restroom. Now to be specific this restroom has entrances on both sides, so one can enter on one side and exit on the other. I walked in and walked out the other side, then walked to my car and drove away.

   I'm sure I'm going to get flack for this post so heres my rebuttals before hand.

Yes I could have done something more expensive and romantic, but this is a first date. I'm judge gauging our compatibility, not trying to seduce you. If we cant have a good time together doing small things, then I'm not wasting my time on you.

Also yes it was warm that day but it wasnt anywhere near hot, I live in the midwest and 100+¬∞f with 80-90% humidity is normal in the summer. So 80¬∞f and low humidity plus a breeze feels pretty good. To top it off other than walking to the food stalls or whatever we were in the shade as well.

Lastly did I have to leave her there, no i didnt have to. I did it for a few reasons, one was I was angry, two I didnt want to deal with her being condescending the drive home. three I wanted to burn that bridge completely, because I'm a nice guy and after my anger wore off I would most likely forgive and forget. So doing what I did made it less likely she would attempt to contact me again and me in turn less likely to attempt a second date.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oe1sgm/privileged_date_gets_to_take_a_bus/

81,oe2ega,1625471668,How can I contact her again(I really like the girl)?,"  

**My Beginning**

It has been quite some time, but she has the power to linger in my thoughts till now. The first meet was when I was on 9th standard in school. I was overweight. It was not that much but was quite observable. My school had a bad reputation for abusive teachers and staff members and, it was well deserved. Teachers made comments on me being overweight. And, when they did it, what would I expect from my classmates? When I told my parents that I wanted to lose weight, they thought that I was going on the wrong tracks, trying to get female attention which would divert me from my academics.

They changed my diet to more carbs, I started to gain more weight, school started to make even more fun of me, everything was a massacre, I was a massacre, bizarre ass. I was thrown to a private coaching center which featured extra small batches and a ""good 1st, worse when you get to know"" tutor. And after getting wrecked there for 3 years, being even more of a destroyed, overweight, unhealthy, negative garbage, I met the girl, my 1st crush.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY SCHOOL**

The school was, a problem. It had such a bad reputation, that a candidate from the school would literally struggle to make friends outside its boundaries. And I was a train-wreck itself.

There were no sports, no extra-curriculars, no care for student‚Äôs wellbeing in anyway. The only thing that mattered was it was a school, and it provided education. The candidates were bad, used to talk in ill-mannered ways outside the school building which was another reason of school's bad reputation. Teachers made fun of the student's parents if they were poor, or if the candidates scored bad marks, they would be ridiculed by the teachers in front of everyone. Any complaints against them would inflict damage on your reports. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TUITION**

The batches in the tuition was small, but the impact on me was strong. Others were from reputed and expensive schools. They always made me aware of the kind of crap I was. I was quite similar to them in academic performance, but they toppled me in all the other fields. Their way to talk, walk, react to situation was quite alienating. But, I managed to hold my ground given for the persistent idiot I was. But I thought they wouldn't be the same. I was never more wrong.

Well, 2 years passed, I told my parents I wanted to go to a different tutor, but they were reluctant. The kids were of the same nature, I didn't even know how to tackle these situations, I didn't even know how to talk properly. I was so shy, a little contact with any girl crippled me. Anyways, after 1 more year, every one of them left due to some issues with the professor. 

At that point, I became silent. I talked to no one, showed no emotions, made no friends, sat at a corner in a room. I entered 1 day, saw a new boy. He was from rich family, was bad at academics, was talkative, smoked, drank, and everything. Another girl joined from the same school as the boy. She was bad at academics too, but was better than the boy. They didn't talk to me. I looked like garbage, smelled like garbage, but now excelled at academics.

**HER(Beginning)**

One day, I arrive at the tuition, and I see the girl. Sitting at the corner I sat in, so I had to opt for another one. She looked quite basic, was cute, and had an even cuter smile. **But**, I was garbage. She ""seemed"" polar opposite of the kinds I met till now. First time in years, I wanted to look and talk to someone. I got to know that she was from the same school as some of the previous kids and was deliberately heart-broken. And seeing myself, I had no hope.

That boy, started to tinker around her, flirting with her, and at sight, it seemed that he was good at it. I was in pain. Alcohol would've helped. Death even more so, but I wasn't that weak. Neither I had the guts to talk to her, nor I had the power to do something about the boy flirting. I took it all as a tank but, started to feel even more depressed. Good thing, the girl didn't like the flirts, so she straight cut told him to stop. He didn't listen, she complained the professor. 

The other day, still one of the best days of my life, I arrived a little late with my jiggly belly and she was early. She looked and smiled at me. It felt warm, and I gave her a smile back with the disgusting round face I had and with all the strength, I picked myself up and instead of a sly corner, I decided to sit beside her. There was distance, but it was shorter. I still didn't have the power to initiate a conversation.  She, decided to make it easy for me and greeted me with a ""Hi!"". I fainted for a brief moment of excitement and with my crippling voice, I said a weak ""Hello!"". She didn't think much of it and asked me my school's name. I knew it would have a bad sting, but I had no option. I said the name. The sting was strong. As was the reputation of my school, and she tried to hide it but, I saw it. I thought it was over, but then, she started to talk more. She asked about my favorite subject, my hobbies, etc. It was like the ocean of happiness for me that day. I had one advantage. I was better than her at academics. I thought that, that was the reason she talked. She wanted help with her hOmeWoRks. I was partially right, but at least, she talked.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY EXCITEMENT**

I was excited as hell. For a brief time, I just forgot that I was thrash. I even told my parents to buy me smartphone. I told them I needed it to communicate with my school and my teachers easily. Ofcourse I lied. I just wanted it so I could exchange texts with her. It was like, I had butterflies in my tummy, tickling me to talk to her. But I kept that to a limit.  

**THE OTHER BOY AND GIRL** 

The boy, started to talk to me too. He was not a nuisance anymore, talked to everyone except the girl I liked. I was happy about it. The other girl however, held her initial impressions and didn't initiate any conversation. However, I didn't care. 

  It was strange, but, both of them left the tuition. I partially liked it, but I still have no idea what happened. But now, for some time, it was only me and my crush in the batch. However, after sometime, it went all downhill.

**THE TUTOR**

He was a ***strange*** man. At first, he was bothersome about the way he talked, but the problem was, he brought up my previous history a lot. It almost seemed like he took pleasure from it. My parents, are quite dumb. They trust anyone quite quick and then, start to share things about family, the things that should stay inside the family. It included my previous deeds, my parent's expectations from me, and everything else. It was quite evident to see how reluctant they were when I wanted to leave this tuition.

This man, after sometime, started to bring all the things he knew about me and some about my family in front of the girl. These things don't matter when making friends, but we were young. I was 15, she was 16, we were dumb. It all started with a mistake I did in some problem like while solving questions. He first ridiculed me, and then, started to the girl like ""You know, his parents are expecting too much from him"" and a lot after that. She listened, looked at me, I felt embarrassed, and the cycle continued. This was everyday now.

**HER(MIDWAY)**

She talked to me for some time after that. Everything seemed normal. But after that, it all went bad. She came and acted like she didn't know me. Stopped initiating any conversation. I wouldn't say it completely due to the things the tutor said, but it must have played some part. Maybe she wasn't just interested in talking to me anymore. But, it was not her fault. I mean, the way I was, even I wouldn't talk to me. But, she talked when she needed help with some questions which was, not a surprise.

**MY STATE**

I was sad. Like a plant which didn't receive sunlight. It was all a massacre. a wreck. I wanted these times to end. I wanted my school years to end. I wanted to know what happened. I wanted to know what was in her mind. But most probably, she didn't even care about it. Maybe I was thinking too much. Maybe, I took her, talking to me, a little too seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE NEW BOY**

He wasn't completely new. I did see him quite some times on another batch. Some members of that batch left so he was merged with us. He became my friend quite quick. He was funny, talked nicely. Yes. It was a threat. It was easy for him too as I was thrash. He was fit, looked nice, and the tutor never ridiculed him like he did me. Maybe he paid more money(I don't know). The tutor would compare me with him and find more reasons to pick against me, its comical now but, was miserable back then. The girl would laugh, the boy would feel proud, I would like for the session to end, and I have no idea what kind of fetish the tutor had. 

**HER TO HIM**

The peculiarity was, she didn't initiate any conversation with him too. So, I thought, maybe, there was some problem I didn't even know about. Anyways, it was sad.

**THE PICNIC**

The tutor, decided to arrange a picnic where his students and their family could join. All 3 of us went there. My family too. Here was a problem. She talked to everyone. Except me. I had no idea why. The picnic was supposed to be fun. I was an idiot who really thought it could be fun.

**SESSION ENDED**

10th standard was the last year the tutor taught. It was quite a miserable journey. I was partially sad about it as I probably wouldn't see the girl. But I was glad that it ended. ***I still had her number***.

**ME BEING AN ASS**

I texted her. That in itself wasn't a problem because she was casual about it too. But you do need a topic to talk about when you don't see each other anymore. I thought I was smart. I asked her to send me some of her math book's exercise as our high school affiliations were different. She sent twice, and probably saw through it, or just didn't want to send anything, and said texted **""I have much more works to do, and, cannot keep sending you exercises""**. 

   I didn't stop there. I kept finding ways to talk to her to which, after some time, she texted **""Kindly stop texting and irritating me""**. So I Stopped. ***For sometime***. I was addicted to her. I wanted more of it.

**AN NGO PROGRAM**

That tutor, arranged a helping for orphans. And, that was the only reason(other than that that I was an idiot) I joined him. When I got there, to my both pleasant and hurtful surprise, I wasn't the only one invited to join. There were many others including the **new boy** I previously talked about, and ***HER***. She sat right at a corner, and I was **SHIVERING**. Not because the texting incident, but because I remembered ***the picnic***. 

It all went as expected. She, talking to everyone except me, me being hurt. The cycle continued.

**TEXTING AGAIN**

I was sure an idiot. But, I denied my loss. I texted her again. She did do the formality of asking about me, but it was cold as it was supposed to be. This time, I directly asked her why did she get irritated. As if it wasn't obvious. She said she didn't remember. Must be that she didn't want to talk about it. Or she was least bothered. Anyways, I have no idea what crossed into my mind, I asked her to meet.

The girl didn't even want to talk me and I, and I asked her to meet. Well, she refused. And after a text or two, it was all over we never contacted each other ever since.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oe2ega/how_can_i_contact_her_againi_really_like_the_girl/
