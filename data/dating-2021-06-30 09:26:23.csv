0,oayfej,1625063190,Why am I [23F] still attracted to someone I used to date [28M]?,"So I met this guy on tinder and he had a lot of red flags like having a preference for women of my race. He’s been online dating for like years as well. He told me he’s has 2 girlfriends in the past, both lasting about 2 months, specifically his first one cheated on him and his second one didn’t want to do long distance with him.

We dated for 2-3 months and I got intimate with him but never had sex. I told him I don’t have sex unless I love that person. He asked three times and I never caved in and he was frustrated. I asked him what was going on. He told me he felt like seeing other women so we stopped seeing each other but the reason he didnt was because he knew that if he left me, he would regret it and that he would lose me. He contacted me after a week like everything was normal but I knew it was because he couldn’t get any matches online and was such an asshole thing to do. It really irritates me.

We got to know each other really well and we both admitted that we missed each other. I know he just wanted me for sex and I’m not sure if he actually misses me or not.

I miss him because he gave me advice and supported me like none of my friends have done in the past.

He said he will have to return to his own country and that’s one reason why he couldn’t commit. He also likes women that wear makeup and knows he has dated a lot of women. I feel that he has an inability to form deep relationships (maybe it’s a man thing or personal and thing). That’s why he enjoys the thrill and excitement of going on dates and impressing girls.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oayfej/why_am_i_23f_still_attracted_to_someone_i_used_to/

2,oayq57,1625064132,should i be concerned or just not sweat it,"so this guy (m23) that I (f24) met via OLD and i have been talking everyday with no pause to our convo for the past 3 weeks. We matched, talked, met up and then talked for about 2 weeks (the convo fizzled out, he left me on read, and I did not want to force anything so i just kind of let it go. I was super bummed about this).\* 

We didn't talk for an entire month and he even started avoiding my snapstories but one day, out of nowhere he hits me up again and we have been talking ever since. This time around, we exchange messages more frequently and have been having much more in depth conversation with both of us doing about equal work to maintain it. He doesn't ask for nudes and doesn't even come close to broaching the topic- never has even in our previous string of conversation. He also has not asked if my plans for the fall have fully materialized yet. And even in the past few days he's been doing more work/showing more interest/asking more questions/and went on a trip and told me about it kind of as a heads up that he won't be around that much. In these past few days we've even been snapping each other closer to bedtime/waking up despite our time difference (i'm 3 hours ahead). So at least, in my eyes, we have definitely been getting closer and things are potentially moving forward?

But i was on the app that we matched on to show one of my coworkers his profile and saw that he had recently updated it...uhh... help? what does this mean? I thought things were going well? what should i do?? 

\*I guess it might be important to note that we met while he was here for school and graduated. He's currently back home for a little before moving to a different state for work- (i am potentially going to be in that state too for more grad school; he knows this but also knows that it's such a slim chance that this will happen)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oayq57/should_i_be_concerned_or_just_not_sweat_it/
3,oayq8o,1625064141,There are billions of women out there and I can't even find one...,"I feel as if the only thing preventing me from finding love is my appearance.

I'm approaching my mid 20s and have a respectable job, yet I've never even managed to get so much as a date.

I've made dozens of online dating profiles over the years. Implementing online strategies ""guaranteed"" to get me matches but nothing. I've burned hundreds of dollars on subscriptions, boosters and even a professional photographer when people tried telling me that it was the selfies. Yet nothing worked.

As much as I was against it. I even went out of my element and tried going out to local clubs/bars to meet women but it's slower and just as ineffective. It's a very awkward environment to meet people when many are there with friends as is. And when you feel like you've struck success after getting a number. You simply end up being ghosted because some people can't manage to turn you down without leading you on.

I'm not even overly picky when it comes to appearance. Yet I can not even get a date much less anything that has the potential to turn into a relationship. It's so frustrating knowing that there are billions of women out there and not even being able to find a single one willing to give me a chance.

6,oaz4kf,1625065342,"I(M30) reconnected with a girl (F25) after months, last time she didn't want to speak with me","Im very embarrassed to post this. But on pandemic Ive dating people in and out, had a couple of ""gfs"" . At some point I didn't want to try to find someone else because I feel like its too much effort with little return.

So I just went into tinder global to see how I would do abroad. I matched with a girl from Russia. It was smooth and we just got along instantly. The next 3 months we spent videocalling (this involved ""sex"") talking and basically she treated me like her bf. Always talking to me 24/7... and this illusioned me so much because she has already been in my country before we started talking so she was planning on come back again.


At some point she mentioned she had bipolar and that she tends to isolate from everyone and feel bad. At some point, she went cold and stopped talking to me. It played on my insecurity and kept asking her if she was ok and if she still liked me but all she said was ""im depressed""

At some point she stopped talking to me all together. Didn't block me or anything. Then I tried talking to her and she just said ""I dont wanna talk to you"" but I was angry so I wrote ""I wish we could've met in real life"" and blocked her when she was replying back. After she saw I blocked her , she also blocked me.

Two months passed and I couldn't stand it anymore. I unblocked her but didn't talk to her at all. She also unblocked me soon after but didn't say a word either. 

Last time I was stalking her ig profile and find a story of someone else taking a pic of her, she was in mexico … my country is in south America.

I couldn't hold it and talked to her "" Hello, are you dating someone?"" - She inmediatly called me, said she was having a panic attack, she was in mexico and told me that she couldn't stand being away from her family. That she was going back to Russia next week. I told her I didn't stop thinking about her and she said that she was sorry, that she wa depressive and treated me bad, and I said I sorry for not understanding. She also said that she had a ticket for my country but her friends here advised her not to come because of political situation (which is true and impresses me that shes being honest about this)

Then we laughed, we had a good conversation, she said ""stay with me please until my friend comes to take me to the store"" and she clearly noted my reaction so she said ""don't be jealous, hes a nerd"" 

Then I went to sleep and next day I found her a message that said"" Hey I just wanted to tell you that im very glad to hear you again and im happy youre doing  great"" 

After that I asked how she was but she didn't respond. I tried the next day and she said ""sorry im on very busy mood"" … well yes, her flight was in a couple of days so that might be true..

Now she arrived to Russia, but she hasn't talk to me. I cant wait and I wanna talk to her but im guessing its out of my reach. I just cant stop overthinking and overanalyzing our last interaction, word by word, trying to see if there might be a clue about how she feels about me... Im going crazy please help me

At the end when her friend arrived, she send me a voice message telling me ""Im glade to hear you again",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oaz4kf/im30_reconnected_with_a_girl_f25_after_months/

We hung out last Wednesday, I texted him Thursday and then by the following Tuesday he still didn’t respond. 

I had a feeling I was being ghosted, and I wasn’t about to let that happen, so I texted him saying something like “Hey not sure if your busy/have something going on but I haven’t heard from you in a while, and it’s ok if you wanna end things if you’re not feeling it, but I just don’t want to be ghosted”. He responded saying he’s sorry and didn’t intend to ghost, but he also wasn’t sure if he saw us ever getting into a relationship, however he still wanted to hang and get to know me better. 

I took this as him politely telling me he wants a FWB, so I told him we had to end things or else I would probably get hurt.

But never knew how to capitalize on it and so decided to do nothing instead. So I do relatively well with interest IRL, but online dating just aint it.

I’ve (23m) been training BJJ for 6 months and have had a blast doing it. About 2 months ago a teammate of mine invited his daughter (18f) to come train with us and she’s since become a regular there.

Usually I only socialize when other people approach me since I’m lacking in the social department but whenever me and this girl talk I find myself very relaxed and able to keep the conversation flowing well between the two of us.

I’m a little hesitant to pursue her since her dad trains there and her mom drops in sometimes as well and I don’t want any bad blood between us if things go south. There’s also the six year age gap between us so there’s that as well. Despite all this, I’ve found my self developing feelings for her.

Any ideas how I can ask her for her number without making things awkward and looking like a creep? Does the age gape between us make a relationship impossible?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ob1huk/introvert_needs_dating_advice/

36,ob1lo9,1625072634,"Subtle, light, playful touch is crucial in building attraction and reinforcing the idea that you are more than a platonic friend","During the first initial stages of dating and getting to know someone, it is important to establish that you are viewed in a romantic/sexual manner, not simply as a friend.

Sometimes, there will be a great conversation and personalities will gel, yet a spark of sexual tension fails to ignite, because the dynamic of the interaction skews more towards friendship.

A key component of ensuring that things progress in a manner that promotes a sexual tension and playfulness is touch.

This can be tricky, because if you are unsure of yourself, or become too eager and rushed, it will backfire and appear creepy or needy. You need to pay attention to how she is interacting with you, and the context of the situation.

For instance, if you immediately try to touch her hands as you sit down on your first date, it will appear desperate and unnatural. Or if she is displaying a low level of attraction or interest, it will likely repel her even further.

A good way to establish a natural, yet subtle touch is hugging when you initially greet each other. The initially hug is light anyway, never a full bear hug or embrace. If you place your hand LIGHTLY on the side of her hip or lower back as you hug, it will subtly reinforce that you are comfortable and confident being close to her without being a creep. Don’t make it a big deal.

As the night (nighttime dates are always better for first initial dates to establish a romantic dynamic) progresses, if you have good chemistry and have a playful vibe, continue with light hand touching. Authentically compliment her on her nails or jewelry, as you lightly put your hands under hers.

There a several other examples. If you are crossing the street, you can gently lead by placing your hand on her lower back. If things progress and the chemistry is there, hand holding, more intimate or playful hugging, and kissing. Paying attention to her body language and mannerisms are key. If she is maintaining eye contact, is talkative, or orienting her body in a manner to get closer, these are typical indicators that you are on the right path

The key is to be natural, light and subtle initially, and of course respectful. You also want her to feel comfortable and safe around you. If done correctly, along with a fun, flirtatious attitude, touch will help establish her perception of you as a potential romantic partner, not a buddy who is fun to talk to.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ob1lo9/subtle_light_playful_touch_is_crucial_in_building/

I've never had short dates - regardless of the time of evening we meet they always seem to last late into the night. The person I'm on a date with usually talks to me a lot and opens up and we often leave thinking there's a real bond, but they never last super long. My friends say it's because I'm easy to talk to and have a calm and non-judgemental aura.

Last night specifically, we met around 5 and I got home from the bar past midnight. I heard about so many of his life experiences and most traumatic events, family tree, regrets, hopes for the future, values. To say it got deep would be an understatement. 

Does this happen to anyone else? Do you take it as a good sign or a red flag? I like honesty and value openness and confidence so it's hard for me to read how appropriate it is.

Just wanted to rant/vent a bit...honestly from all my dating experience and looking at other people it feels like finding someone you could share you life (or at least some long part of it) kind of impossible. I am not talking about finding someone for a shorter relationship, that isn't hard - dating apps, friends circle and clubs are perfect for that. But all my(27m) relationships and situationships ended sooner or later due to growing numbers of incompatibilities. Just think about it - to find a partner who is going to be with you for a long time and especially if you plan to create a family you need to have a romantic connection, similar life goals and be one the same page on religion, politics, finances, sex, have at least some common interests...that feels like one in a million chance, not something that could happen fairly often. How do people stay together even for 5-10 years? I am not even asking for a whole life. Are most people more tolerable to incompatibilities than I think?

49,ob2v4m,1625076280,does this feeling ever go away?,"Never really wrote down all the things bothering me, but here I go!

Why do I feel so alone! I shouldn’t! I have such a loving family around me, I have a lot of friend who would drop everything if I called them, but I just can’t shake this feeling! It’s the worst!

Out of all my friend groups I’m literally the only single one left… everyone from my high school crew… married with kids. Everyone from college crew… married or engaged. Everyone one from my family friend crew… married and in LTR about to be engaged. Everywhere I go, if it’s not a boys night it’s all couples… and I can’t even complain because whether it was a boy or girl that married into the friend group I got along with them great and see them as family!

Dating is so hard… why?! I’m on the apps and I’ve made it known, please swipe of serious… I’m in my mid-30s now… why the text games? I would think females that I match with who are close to my age might be over games too…. So many dates/flings just fizzle out… I try to put myself out there, and never super aggressively… go with the flow, communicate, etc… my biggest question... when we're reaching our mid-30s, why are we running into people of similar age who still like playing games/ghosting etc.

I just want to feel that happiness again… that happiness you get from a simple “good morning 😊” text from a significant other… the happiness you get after the first kiss with someone you’re really connected and vibing with… the happiness you get when you’re being hugged…. I don’t even know when’s the last time I was just hugged, like really hugged!

It’s so dumb but the three happiest moments that have stuck out in my life…. When I was 18 and I asked my crush out to prom and the way her face lit up and how she hugged me…. I still rmbr that feeling of happiness i had. The second moment was when I had my first kiss with the first love of my life and best friend, where we then got into a 6 year relationship…. Third was, when my entire extended family came to my town for my brothers wedding, not even mine, but just having everyone there at the same time… was so happy… just wished I had that special someone with me too.

Am I ever going to feel that happiness again? The butterflies in my stomach when I find that one.

I have a great family, great extended family and awesome sets of friends… yet I feel so lonely.

I hate this feeling! Why do I feel like I’m always getting this feeling… if I find a girl I’m remotely interested in, I feel like I’m always the one initiating. Am I just not likable? I’ve always been very respectful, kind, positive and outgoing… give off good vibes... i know I'm not bad-looking by any means either.  just shit luck I guess!

Anytime I run into elders (grandparents or aunts/uncles) of my family they all say, out of all our grandchildren we are waiting for your wedding the most and have the best wishes in our heart for you! It brings tears to my eyes everytime I think of it!

I’ve been hurt so many time yet every date I’m like, nah, let’s go in to this positively… there’s at least one person out there for everyone… I’m starting to think that’s not true.

Recently its just been hard to even get out of bed, and when I do, I just go about my day with no excitement.. i work, eat, try and go for a walk all to pass the time so I can get back into bed.

I'm just waiting for the day where I can go on a walk around the neighborhood or town, just holding that specials someone's hand and just know everything will be alright... maybe ill be waiting for that feeling forever... who knows.

Man… I don’t even know anymore. Anyway, if you’re reading this, I only hope the best wishes for you and hope whatever you’re going through fades away soon and you live a life of full happiness!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ob2v4m/does_this_feeling_ever_go_away/
50,ob2wly,1625076402,Should she have mentioned her boyfriend earlier or was I too naive ?,"I (21M) met a girl (24) while enrolling at my new university, in the same course as her. We just had a small talk there. We live in two different countries and the university is in a third one. Our lectures were all in distance learning for the whole year and being in first year, there wasn't much interaction between students.
 We started talking via text messages, like for a few days every 3-4 weeks and it mostly revolved around classed. After a few months, we talked more about personal stuff and I started to really like her since I felt we could be a good match. I was moving to the country where our university is and told her that I would love to take her to dinner or a drink when she arrived in the same city. She responded enthusiastically and we kept on texting as before, regularly but not daily but this time on varied topics. This continued for a few months, I started the conversations a little bit more often than her ( something like 60/40) and I probably showed a bit more attention than before. I was in the city of our university and she was supposed to move there in a few monthes
But recently, I brought back the topic of the dinner invitation and called it a date without much thought and she then told me she had a boyfriend.
I felt surprised, as I thought I made my intentions pretty clear, even though I never asked her directly if she was single, and she never mentioned him to me.
I complimented only once or twice and never mentioned my feelings towards her, I didn't want to be too invasive and it seemed absurd since we almost never saw each other in person yet ( but we were supposed to in the next monthes ). 
I feel quite disappointed, I had started to get attached ( probably too fast I admit ). It left me with two questions: Have I been too naive or Could she have mentioned her boyfriend earlier ?

52,ob2ykf,1625076549,What am I supposed to do when I’m never the guy she ultimately chooses to date?,"I’m a 21M trying to date in college and I’ve been having a really hard time. It seems like every girl I start talking to or dating ends up ghosting me because there is always a guy they like better and it seems like I’m just the placeholder for a date or 2 until he arrives. And before I get the “work on myself and it’ll happen” comments, I have been doing that for years. I’m very driven with my career, I have been working out and dieting for a long time now (went from very frail and skinny to muscular), I’m very confident in my appearance and I like the way I look, and I put myself out there and socialize a lot. I know I’m not ugly either, I’m 6’3 and able to get hundreds of matches on dating apps and I often have girls approach me when I go out to bars/clubs. 

But even with all that I’m always the guy they fizzle out after a couple of dates. I’m starting to think with the rise of online dating and with how many guys compared to girls there are on those apps (considering men swipe on almost everything and are much less picky than women on there), I’m never going to be anyone’s #1 option, so I feel like this is always going to keep happening. I’ve also never been in a relationship or had sex, so obviously at 21 I’m really feeling the anxiety right now.

Like is the only solution to this, is to date someone I’m not attracted to so I can finally be someone’s #1 option? I’ve had mixed feelings about this bc some people say you can fall in love with someone’s personality and physical attraction can build over time, but I also hear that if you’re not physically attracted it will never happen. So I’m just unsure of what to do.

It’s just unfortunate because I’m dating a girl right now where everything seems great. We have so much in common and many of the same interests, and I’m very physically attracted to her, but I just fear that the same thing will happen with her. The second she meets a guy who’s more attractive than me then it’ll be another kick in the nuts for me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ob2ykf/what_am_i_supposed_to_do_when_im_never_the_guy/

55,ob3fye,1625077939,I am 31 years old and I need advice.,"I am writing this post to seek advice, guidance, and emotional support on an obvious issue that I can longer ignore, which is that I am 31 years old and I have never had a girlfriend. I am of East Indian descent; however, I grew up in California. I have been told numerous times that I am a good-looking guy, and some people are even shocked to find that I have never had a girlfriend before. Throughout much of my adult life, I have been overlooked by girls. I have seen Indian guys score girls, yet I would be left with nothing and it often makes me think just ""What exactly is it about these guys that make them particularly appealing?"" ""What exactly do these guys have that I do not?"" I have a fair complexion for an Indian so I am quite often told that I do not ""look Indian"" but rather Hispanic or middle eastern, which irritates me. I am very insecure about my figure, as I believe that it is the sole reason that people have never respected me- I am 5'8"" with a slender build, which makes me look a lot younger than my actual age; I could very easily pass for 22. Many of these Indian guys may be taller than me-6'1"", however, they are not exactly the most refined of people- they are very callous and rude. Many times, where girls have expressed interest in me, there has always been some jealous male that has ruined it for me. I have tried using dating sites, such as Tinder, and much to my chagrin, I have never matched even once in the past two years that I have been using the app. For a while, I stopped caring by reassuring myself that I can live without a girlfriend, but unfortunately, I am reaching an age where I need to find someone. 

I ought to mention that I would prefer to date a girl outside of my ethnicity. I must profess that anytime I see a brown guy with a white girl, I become infuriated with jealousy because I often think that if that brown guy can score a white girl, why can't I? What exactly does that brown guy have that I don't? I wouldn't feel the same way if the guy were White, Yellow, or Black, but only Brown. 

One could contend that there may be something about myself that I could change, and I completely agree; however, one attribute about the physique that I have not been able to change is my height, and I know that women do care about that- they are lying if they tell you that it is not important. Consequently, I am strongly considering undergoing cosmetic limb lengthening surgery, which would essentially make me 5 inches taller, and put me at 6'1"", and not to mention people wouldn't bully me and women would be more likely to express interest in me. 

If I were a brown guy standing at 6'1"" and not 5'8"", I would be respected and not bullied as much as I have throughout my life. I am constantly told by women that I look like a little boy and not like a grown man simply because of my small build. 

It is my misfortune to have been dealt with a very bad genetic hand at birth; however, I do plan to redeem by making myself taller to improve the quality of my life and ultimately ensure my happiness.

58,ob3l7h,1625078366,Playing games or interested?,"Hey everyone, 

I made the rookie mistake of falling for 1 chick, and I have a hard time focusing on other girls because she’s all I really think about now. 

To preface:
I’m in the military and In an area where there’s not a lot of women in general, so I feel women out here have inflated sense of egos from being hit on. She is also in the military, so that amplifies that (we’re both officers). 

I dm’d her on IG, just commenting on a story , she responded and I left it at that. Fast forward, and we meet at a house party. Pretended not to remember her (forgot her name honesty), she was Iike you remember me. We go out in a group that night, and I tell her I’m not sorry for DM’ing her because I thought she was attractive. She takes her friend home, and we leave it at that. 

We start snapping more, and she agrees to get tacos after work. But the day of she flakes because she gets off work and is tired and wants to go to bed. I try to reschedule for lunch at work, she says yes but she needs to work thru lunch and can’t come. 

I stop responding to all her continued thirst trap snaps, or send Random things back to her unrelated to her snaps. One day I comment on her IG story and ask her to do a 5k the next day, she agrees. Next day it starts pouring and she says she doesn’t wanna do it. 

She invites me to a concert, but stays at the beach too long with her friends so I go out somewhere else. I reschedule to get sushi the next day, she flakes before saying she needs to get a confirmation slide done. 

This weekend we meet up in a group sending at some bars. We flirt the whole night and dance/grind together. I go for the make out and she smiles/blushes and dodges it. The end of the night, the group is outside and she starts asking for random dudes for rides home because we were just talking and I guess she wanted to get home for her field op monday. Of course we’re like wtf, I go to get her back and she says “I’m not going home with you tonight” I talk to her alone and tell her that if she’s not interested in me I’ll leave her alone. I joke and say I know you’re not into brown dudes and she laughs. 

She then asks some other drunk dude who she rejected earlier for a ride and gets in. My whole group is like go get her. I stop the car and basically threatened the two dudes if they did anything to her, called one ugly and a POG lol. She says it’s okay and leaves. 

Next morning I apologize over text and she says “you’re good”. I say we should get coffee and she says another day because she’s busy packing. While she’s in the field her friend dies, I text her the next day if she’s doing okay and no response. 

She always views my stories and is one of the first ones to see them.

61,ob3uo5,1625079121,OLD has made me depressed. What are my options?,"Just went on another dud last night, one of those where they don’t feel it quite as much as you do and it’s obvious by the time the date is over. The kind that makes you question what’s wrong with you that you can’t close when you know they already think you’re attractive, have texted with you for a week, seen your Instagram, etc. 

It was the fifth dud in a row. 

I’ve had dozens of “successes” with dating apps over the years, plenty of FWB’s and (unfortunately) ONS’s. Lots of times I’ve felt a budding romance that could be special, only to get “you’re handsome and charming, but the spark isn’t there…” or “I’m looking for a certain kind of connection and I’m not feeling it with you.”

The worst part is knowing that I do have a vibrant personality because it’s all that got me through my ugly duckling phase in my teens. But maybe it isn’t a sexy personality, maybe it’s too quirky. I think this because I ended up becoming handsome by almost any standard and a good bit over six feet tall—yet I went on 6 dates last week and 5 of them made me hate myself after. I started to wonder how it’s possible that I used to succeed on 80-90% of my dates only to now suddenly flatline almost completely for weeks on end. 

I’m super depressed about my recent streak. Self-hatred is pouring in. My best friend, confidant and former wingman (who now lives 3000 miles away) told me last night that it’s obvious I need to be meeting friends of friends and going to house parties and whatever, but… I don’t have social friends anymore. They’re married or moved away. I’m not sure I believe in a dating world outside of apps. My worldview is fucked. Who doesn’t use apps these days?

I was told I should start going to bars by myself and mope around until someone thinks I look interesting and talks to me. Then I can find a new friend group at 28 years old.

I’m 20 now and I’m so bad with girls that u haven’t even had my first kiss yet. I just suck at it and I’m weird looking so that makes it a decent bit harder.

I have a lot of fomo regarding relationships, love, and sex. I know people are going to try to tell me I’m so young and I have all the time to do this stuff but I really don’t. Time goes by fast and I know that if I don’t get that experience soon I’ll miss out.

I don’t want to never experience young love, I already know that I’ll never get to be someone’s first love but I still can experience young love. I don’t want for my first relationship to be when I’m 27 and with a woman who understands what she wants in life while I’m still making the mistakes a high schooler would make in a relationship.

I also don’t want to be with only one person my entire life. I want a chance to explore sexually and that should be now while I’m young but I don’t know if I can get a chance like that. Everyone gets a chance to sow their wild oats most people do it in high school, college, and their early 20s and how my life’s going, I doubt I’ll get a chance.

 my second ex fiancée left again when she couldn't get past my views on things something tells me  she wasn't all that happy living with me as it was    


sense then iv had a bunch of rather intense but short lived relationships  that usually end with her not being able to commit ""im too nervous"" ""im not ready"" ect in some ways i feel bad there must be something wrong with me not being able to find someone who is willing to commit  

iv opened my self to dating new types (is saying types or kinds of women better i don't want to be accused of being xyz... again)of women including feminists and the genderfluid (did not go all that well) but maybe i learned something useful  


but on the other hand i hear things like ""i know what i want and i wont settle for less"" enough to think saying it my self is only fair only to be told...... its not?

people say im too clingy i call it craving closeness and intimacy they say i come on too strong i call it being honest and not wanting to waist time yes i like and want sex i don't see why saying that is a problem  


no im not just looking for friends  i don't understand why so many people will go on dating sights looking for friends  ...that's not what they are for ... but with so many people telling me im wrong i must be wrong    


im not here just to give you money i may be a bit of a clown but its not my job to entertain you

We shared everything, had common friends and interests. I was looking up to him as he was three years older than me, ambitious and smart. Only after the break up and taking my distance I started realising we were co-dependent. I tried to stay in touch with him but he ghosted me. I was devastated, had to start building my own life and circle of friends. Staying single again has been my best period. Gradually, I started laughing again, meeting with guys, making friends. All this time, he was stalking me from social media but didn't contact me. So I decided to unfriend and unfollow him and delete his number but I did it for me. I started looking back realising he was toxic and not a good influence for me but kept also good memories cause there was a period he has been there for me (he cared about me and helped me a lot but he was also trying to cut me off my friends and my social life or trying to change my personality which he later missed as he said). After a year, he contacted me on social media. I was still in love with him, couldn't let go completely was scared to lose something that was so close to me and familiar. I felt flattered couldn't believe it. We started talking again and it felt like yesterday. But something wasn't feeling right. After a while, I started feeling suffocated, whereas in the past I couldn't get enough at that moment I started to despise him, couldn't care less about him and that shocked me.

He couldn't accept that I was growing and was a different person and he couldn't manipulate me anymore. But he kept appealing on our friendship until he started telling me he couldn't date others or sleep because of me. I freaked out and told him I don't want be responsible for his happiness. I decided to block him delete contact and never look back. He managed to contact me on the only platform we were connected and ask me for another chance. I blocked him there too. Felt was the right thing to do to help him move on.

As the title suggests i kind of need some advice for dating and even meeting people.

I have unfortunately found it hard to date and meet people at all in the past few years since i met a woman by pure chance in my teens, as such my confidence has been non existent in terms of social ability and self confidence.

I have found being on the spectrum and dating really hard, especially on dating apps, as sadly people i have met see ""autism"" and nope out of there, however i have tried speaking to few people who didnt mind the autism but i found conversations went stale rather quick.

I struggle with socialisation due to ostracism as a child to young adult meaning i had no chance to develop socially, but on top of that reading body language and understanding tone is hard, i saw a post about approaching women, but sometimes i find it hard to as i feel i may come across as creepy, especially since its hard to pick up body language.

Does anyone have any advice or experience they can share which can help me take a right turn.

I do have other issues than autism such as being a dwarf at 5ft 3 and also overweight, which the weight im slowly working on.

I will join a site, get some really odd messages and I leave the sites usually within a week.

The reason why I ask is that while I could just rip the proverbial bandaid off, strike up a conversation, and ask them out, I’m not sure if this will put them off since I’ve never really had a conversation with them before. Yes, I’ve heard a lot of people talking about “cold approaches” and talking to people in public, but something about that has always seemed odd to me, I feel it would be a bit weird to be asked out by someone you didn’t even know existed beforehand.

Recently me and my friends met some tourist girls in the beach, we made really good company and proceeded later that night with couple of drinks and we walked around the city until 4am. The girls was very cultivated and smart people with humor. Honestly it was the best company I had for a year or more. I really loved their vibes and I have on my mind only one girl. We had some great conversations and shared ideas, goals and we all exchanged instagram's. The problem is she lives in France while I live in south Europe. They are travel addicts and I like travelling as well (my friends aren't). So I want to visit France (for her) and when I go there, you think I should let her know that I am in France or she could see an instagram post.. and maybe she could show me around, hang out together etc. that would be natural or weird? I know I could replace her by getting to know other girls but I loved this vibe and I don't want to erase it by forgetting her and moving forward.

93,ob7hnv,1625089924,Red flag or nah?,"Can’t post a screenshot but this is the text I got from my partner “Just saying you rather be on a lower level and argue. I rather level up learn more and run w it. Which I thought I had someone to do it with. But it’s just you want respect and equality but that’s what I give my friends not my girlfriend”


For context,
He (M22) is the oldest child in his family, 3 siblings and a single mother. He’s basically the financial supporter of the home. I said I couldn’t go on vacation w them bc I spent too much money this month (I do what I can to help my family financially too). My family grew up very poor and it took them a long time for them to be financially stable like they are now. His family had wealth and went homeless and are working their way up again this time he is the main one providing, so he says. I understand what it’s like to be poor and I tried to console by sharing our story. We ended up arguing bc he assumed I was trying to one up him. That I always want to be better or have something better to say.

Tbh I wouldn’t brag about being poor and then say I have x amount of money now. I also wouldn’t share the things my family had to go through just to anyone. Some of those things are just hard to share with just anybody. 

Anyways the whole point of me saying all that was to demonstrate how much time it took them to be able to have what we currently do. (My parents are in their late 50s btw)

He always makes me sound privileged. I hate being seen that way bc there was times I had nothing too and I work hard for what I have. 

I don’t know I feel like all the weird animosity he thinks he sense from me is really his inner thoughts about me. There’s a lot of other things he said and I wish I could put screenshots for better context. 

Also when I said it took my parents x amount of years to even make x amount of money he said “I’m not trying to be your parents I wanna be better than them” I understood his feelings but did feel disrespected about everything he was saying  and how he reacted.


Also is there like a therapist on here who can analyze these texts? I’m tired of feeling like I’m crazy I wanna know if I was really out of line with what I said",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ob7hnv/red_flag_or_nah/
94,ob7hxc,1625089948,Should I make a move?,"So I've been seeing this girl for a while and we aren't shy of getting physical with eachother. My problem comes in where she's told me before that she's saving herself for marriage, now I don't want to openly defy that but sometimes things get really hot between us and she says a lot of really suggestive things that imply she wants sex. I'm not sure if in a moment of passion where she starts getting physical if I should make the move or not. I obviously respect consent and her morals 100% but sometimes I really wonder if she wants to make the decision to move forward and I'm not sure how to approach it, would really appreciate some advice",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ob7hxc/should_i_make_a_move/

I’m the first person he’s dated since the end of that relationship.ñ my We’re really enjoying each other company and see each other multiple times a week. I have a toothbrush at his house and he’s even given me keys to come by after I get off work. He’s very monogamous and only wants to see me, but the thing is I want him to date other people. I don’t want our relationship to end up failing because he was just rebounding. I want to be a choice, THE choice. I think it bothers him that I am also seeing other people so I don’t get caught up too quickly.  We are not having sex until things are official, and I am not having sex with other people either, so there’s no worries there. I’m just so confused because I’m falling in love with him, but I don’t think he’s explored his options enough after being single again.

98,ob7vrb,1625091121,"As much as I want to keep trying with online dating, it's not worth it.","As a guy who wants to find a real relationship, with all the wholesome things like cuddling and just enjoying being together, long term thinking, and of course when the times right, the fun stuff, it's impossible to find someone online. 

I feel drowned out nowadays online. I've seen some of my female friends apps and they have hundreds of matches, while I do get a steady 1-2 per day, they never go anywhere and nobody seems to want to try and hold a conversation. 

It's harder too when you're stronger at holding conversations in person, and online you need to try and guess what might get the person interested as everyone's different. 

I hate pick up lines, I just want to know how they are doing and getting to know them, then go on a date instead of wasting weeks occasionally messaging each other. 

It feels like everyone just doesn't want to put the effort out, and and they can't ever give the benefit of the doubt to at least try a conversation. I can always guarantee the more we talk to better the conversations get, but it's so rare for that to happen. 

While I know I'm not perfect, I know I'm not bad looking, I have a decently interesting life, and I'm really into a wide variety of things, so it's not like I'm boring or a disrespectful as I actively make sure to not be that kind of person (I appreciate my parents for making sure I turned out as a decent person) 

I don't know, the dating scene feels set up to fail from my perspective unless you have lots of money or you're a model, but even then it's not a real connection.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ob7vrb/as_much_as_i_want_to_keep_trying_with_online/
99,ob7wfp,1625091184,How do you deal with the feelings of jealousy or envy of everyone around you,"I’m in college and I have a pretty big friend group. According to a few rude girls, I’m the ugly friend. Im also very shy and I have a pretty difficult time talking to women due to previous bullying and mocking because of my appearance. 

I’m the only virgin in my friend group and the only guy that’s never even been on a date. All of my friends are confident and attractive and either have girlfriends or able to pull pretty much any girl they want.

I feel so fucking jealous of all of them. I wish I could be like them but unfortunately it’s just not something I think I’m able to. I don’t want to be jealous of them. But I can’t help it and I think I resent them on some level for it.
