Here‚Äôs the situation: I‚Äôve been talking to this guy on Snapchat for almost two months now. We used to work together five years ago but were never friends then and he had a girlfriend at the time. Never told him this, but I had a crush on him then and hated seeing them together. If he hadn‚Äôt been in a relationship I might‚Äôve made a move. He moved to Denver maybe four years ago but was back in town for a wedding and we matched on tinder. He was the one that asked me for my snap and started snapping me to begin with. It hasn‚Äôt really been much, we really only talk about music, tv shows, and movies because we have a lot of the same taste and interests there. I know that just because you share common interests with someone it doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre your ‚Äúsoulmate‚Äù or something. But I‚Äôve never experienced this with any other guy. 

I was planning on moving by next fall and really considering Denver, not because he lives there but because I‚Äôve wanted to live there for a while. Found out yesterday he might be moving to Boston. Pathetically, finding that out made me feel some type of way. I don‚Äôt really know why we‚Äôve kept talking every day. Does he just want to feel better about himself that an attractive girl wants to talk to him? He apparently must‚Äôve liked me then. I know I should just ask him but does anyone have any advice or input? I spent a lot of time wanting a guy to ‚Äúsave‚Äù me, but I know that I have to save myself. Maybe I‚Äôm just an idiot and should stop talking to him since nothing‚Äôs going to happen there.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1128594,public,self,What is the point?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qzc6x7/what_is_the_point/,no_ads,0,,,,,,

He is my absolute ride or die, just gets me on a level almost no one has, always supports me, helped me prepare for really hectic job interviews for his company and therefore assisted me to get the job of my dreams, is the best sex I‚Äôve ever had and is just the most fun I‚Äôve ever had. Even watching tv with him is wonderful. I‚Äôm at peace when I‚Äôm with him and love every minute. 

We know each other better than anyone else and know each other‚Äôs deepest, darkest secrets.

However early on, we discovered that we both sit on opposing fence of family planning and neither of us will ever be willing to budge.

Since finding this out 1 month in, we tried going our separate ways and ended up getting in more deep by hanging out with each other‚Äôs friends and being sure that we could just entertain this as a casual thing.

2 months on he broke up with me since there was just no point in being together. Except the break up didn‚Äôt really stick and we wound up dating again.

From then on it became a series of breaking up and slowly getting back together. We tried everything. Not talking, blocking, trying to be casual, unfollowing each other everywhere, but nothing has worked. Anytime there is emotional turmoil or the like, one of us breaks the staying apart pact and the cycle starts over.

Our friends don‚Äôt even know that we are hanging out anymore, as there‚Äôs just no point in frustrating them with our endless cycle, so we see each other in secret.

Each break up has produced such bad anxiety that I can‚Äôt breathe and can‚Äôt function, producing this insane up down rollercoaster and this absolutely irrational relationship restart and addiction to him. I‚Äôve never felt bereft without another person before, but it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm on top of the world when I‚Äôm with him and crash down to earth when it‚Äôs over.

This past weekend we talked about it and he asked what I wanted to do. I said I genuinely didn‚Äôt know as we‚Äôve tried everything and just can‚Äôt seem to stay away from each other. He said, ‚ÄúI know. my head says this isn‚Äôt right. But my heart says something else‚Äù.

I just have no idea what to do anymore and was hoping someone else has experienced similar.

I used to think I was hideous and disgusting. I couldn‚Äôt even fathom the idea of someone finding me attractive. As I‚Äôm sure you can imagine, I was also terrified of rejection, so never put myself out there. But at the start of 2021 I decided I was sick of feeling this way and put in a lot of work to change my mindset. Now I‚Äôm in a far better place. I even went on my first date a month ago, and even though he rejected me, I was actually okay afterwards!

Anyway, to get to the point, I had my first kiss/somewhat sexual experience last night, and my head is still spinning thinking about it. I went clubbing with my best friend, and I knew I looked really damn good. We went outside to the smoking area (we don‚Äôt smoke but we just wanted to take a breather) and I noticed that the guy standing next to us was extremely attractive and pretty much the definition of my type. I made eye contact with him briefly and glanced away when he saw. But he then started talking to us. He said I was gorgeous, and asked me if I was single, but because I assume that no one is ever attracted to me, I didn‚Äôt think anything of it. But then my friend went to the restroom and he asked me to stand closer to him. He put his arm around me and next thing I knew we were making out. 

We then went back inside to dance and started kissing again. His hands were roaming all over me: my cheek, my waist, my thigh, and then he grabbed and squeezed my ass. And I fucking loved it. I was feeling things I had never felt before and I literally felt dizzy. He whispered in my ear ‚Äúyou‚Äôre sexy as fuck‚Äù and ‚ÄúI want to fuck you so bad‚Äù. Given that I‚Äôm a virgin with zero experience I obviously wasn‚Äôt going to have sex with him that night, but man, there aren‚Äôt even words for how turned on I was. Someone saying ‚ÄúI want to fuck you‚Äù to me has been one of my fantasises for years. He asked me to go home with him, which I politely declined, and he respected my wishes without seeming annoyed or entitled. My friend and I had to leave not long after but before we did he said ‚Äúcan I kiss you again?‚Äù, and just the fact that he asked was so hot. The kiss was even more intense that time: we practically had our tongues down each other‚Äôs throats. When I got home, I could barely sleep because I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about him.

Today he texted me saying he had a great night and that I‚Äôm a ‚Äúgreat kisser‚Äù, which I‚Äôm shocked by considering I had no clue what I was doing üòÇ. We‚Äôve now arranged to go for drinks on Friday, and he says he‚Äôs going to show me a ‚Äúgood night‚Äù. I can‚Äôt wait.

Actually lol originally we matched on bumble but it said he wasn't sure what he was looking for and he was \*really\* hot (far out of my league) so I think I chickened out before we were going to hang out and said I couldn't and bailed (assumed it would be a one-night stand situation which I don't do). 

Later I switched to hinge and it had us as most compatible so he messaged me, I explained why I'd originally bailed, discovered he actually was looking for a relationship, and wound up planning a new date. I actually almost didn't go because the night before I had had a horrible date with a different man who lowkey sexually assaulted me and who was really awful and just- a ton of red flags. I was up until 1am, got 5 hours of sleep, and had to chug an iced chai tea to have the energy for the date. But I went and it was wonderful. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then I saw him again and again and like I still thought he was out of my league in many ways and so I tried to suppress my hopes a bit but I did start crushing and like long story short we made it an official exclusive relationship tonight and I'm just really really happy about it :). I think we are so well suited and I just feel so comfortable and happy with him and we are both a little weird in the same way and I really think we are good people for each other.

This is probably more of like a rant and should probably go in that group instead. What I guess I am looking for is emotional support. Please. 

In short: I find it impossible to get a girlfriend and girls either dump me after 1-2 dates or they just use me for attention in varying constellations. 

I am 29M and I never had a girlfriend and I am still a virgin. I had my first kiss and first (semi)sexual experience last year at 28 with a girl whom I met on Tinder and I was dating for year. But long story short she was leading me on. She was just 20 when we met and she had (other people suggested this as well based on my accounts) some covert emotional problems probably due to growing up with a mentally ill and alcoholic single mom. I never went all the way with this girl with whom I fell in love even though I suggested having sex more than once and she didn't want to meet up often - a red flag I know. She eventually just wanted to be friends but this was not possible I told her and broke of all contact with her months ago. Even though I do really care about her and worry about her on the other hand I think I did dodge a bullet. 

However, I can't help feeling bad about my situation. I know you can't change the past and that I should really take pride in making progress. I suffered from servere loneliness in my teens with no friends and my dad is an alcoholic. I tested as an ISFP and I really appreciated the answer a guy gave me about how as an INFP/ISFP it's pretty normal that I was just mainly observing girls and maybe talking to the ones I knew but I certainly was not approaching girls and/or making out with any back then.

But I still feel bad about it being so hard for me to just meet a girl and make her my girlfriend. These things have to happen naturally and I don't want to be a player. But the fact that Tinder is just mainly giving me likes from girls I don't find that physically appealing but I did try to just text them anyway and when I go on dates which I do pretty regularly when I am not taking a break from dating it usually ends with a cup of coffee and then it just ends there.

I am thinking about joining a regular group activity to meet girls. when I meet girls online I sometimes just text girls for the hell of it and it seems sometimes they just want my attention and I have a hard time breaking it off even though I solely have a platonic interest in them.

I am a fairly good looking guy, I am smart and have been described as intelligent, funny and charming by girls.

I (30f) started talking to this guy (let's call him guy A - m37) a little over a month ago. Things have been going great for the most part. We've hung out pretty much every weekend up until the last two because he's out of the country visiting family. We end up staying up until 6 or 7 am because we never run out of things to talk about and he's mostly been very gentlemanly. My dog passed away before two days before he left for his trip and I was an utter mess and he invited me to come stay with him those next two nights and I dropped him off at the airport. We haven't talked about exclusivity but we've had many deep conversations about family and our past in general and I can't emphasize how much him comforting me after my dog passing means. 

However, there have also been a couple of (imho) red flags. He has mentioned that he tends to have a temper and little patience. I got upset one night when I met his friends for the first time and two of the girls kept grabbing his butt for an hour and a half. I tried to not spiral and let it get to me but I finally pulled him aside and told him I hated watching it happen for that long and how I had to talk to him for it to stop instead of him stopping it himself. 

There was another night when we went to his friend's house (just us 3) when his friend and I started talking about video games/movies and things that I guess he doesn't relate to. He blurted out that maybe his friend and I should be talking instead of him and I. After we went back to his place, he got angry with me for interrupting him at one point and then said he didn't see any potential in me long-term. We were drunk so I started crying and gathered myself in the bathroom and when I went back, he was really confused. Seems like he may have blacked out for those 10 minutes but I let it go for the time being. He's been on his vacation this past week and will be this upcoming week and we talked on the phone once so far (but still text a lot in general). We both have tough family lives and I know he's with his parents. Seems like he had a rough day with them but didn't want to give me details so I let it go. I changed the subtext and was telling him about a podcast I love which narrates short horror stories and he knows true crime/spooky things are a big interest of mine. He totally snapped and started saying his mom lives in fear all of the time because of things like that and how he doesn't get enjoyment from being scared and all of it is ""so so so dumb"". His overall tone just sounded angry and like he wanted to be mean/take out his frustration on me. He also said that I shouldn't bother getting him from the airport if he's not the last person I kissed which i get to an extent but to talk exclusivity when he's gone already felt kind of...controlling and possibly manipulative? He texted after that call apologizing and saying I didn't deserve it. I explained to him my sentiments from above and also that I'm hurting from losing my dog since it'd only been a week and i haven't been able to sleep in my bed since my dog was always my cuddle bug. He also knows my parents can be emotionally abusive so I don't feel like I have support at home which makes his anger feel even more palpable. I told him it makes me question the longevity of dating him if this is how he normally reacts and wants to put people down when he's feeling down.  

Historically speaking, I have made awful choices in men who mostly cheat and my home situation doesn't make me confident in many areas of my life (also I am in the process of looking for a new therapist). Because of that, I'm trying not to hyperfocus on one guy and instead, at least go on more dates so I can learn more about myself and what kind of person I can see myself with in the future. 

Fast forward to this past Thursday, I went on a date with a different guy (let's call him guy B, m33). I felt guilty even going based on what guy A had said but I talked to my friends and they said I don't owe him anything if we hadn't hashed it out already and I should be selfish in this scenario.. The date with guy B went very well and we have a lottt more in common than myself and guy A but I still feel strongly for guy A. Guy B ended up staying this weekend just to spend more time with me so we went to an event together. Thing is, I met them both the same night at a similar event a while back and thought I avoided running into guy A's friends but one was still there and took notice of guy B. I ended up telling guy A's friend the gist of the situation and how I'm not ready to stop talking to his friend but it seems more likely than not that he will stop talking to me altogether once I tell him. His friend agreed and that he hopes that's not the case because he was telling him to keep me around because the two of us seemed promising. To top it all off, I still ended up having a really great time with guy B that night and did text guy A saying I have to talk to him about something soon but again, he doesn't come back for another week. 

So my question essentially is how should I approach this with guy A? Do I tell him over the phone before he comes back since he said he didn't want me getting him from the airport if I did anything with anyone else or do I wait to discuss until he comes back? Do you guys think I did anything wrong...? I'm having a lot of anxiety over all of this.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1128622,public,self,Help please - Did I do something wrong/how should I approach this?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qzdpf7/help_please_did_i_do_something_wronghow_should_i/,no_ads,0,,,,,,

He is my junior and is a newcomer to this lab. He is a shy guy, quite reserved but can be funny at times.

Anyway, I've been going my way to approach him so that I can get to know him more, such as talking to him (he really enjoys talking to me) and making cookies together. Since he's very well-reserved, none of his friends and classmates know if he likes guys or girls. Just recently, I noticed that he was in a bad mood and he didn't really want to speak out on the subject. Yesterday, after making cookies together, we had a long chat, and for some reason we brought up the talk about his bad mood. Surprisingly, he told me that he likes guys and he had a crush on one of my labmates, but his crush was not reciprocating. The bad mood was actually caused by his inability to approach his crush and also jealousy on his crush. I was surprised that he's being so honest about the subject, as he seemed reluctant to talk about it before.

We tend to have very meaningful and deep conversation with each other that doesn't really happen for other labmates. I do wonder if he really just gonna treat me like a friend, that's why he talks a lot more with me and get friend-zoned by him. I'm that kind of guy who only want to date someone I really know well. Right now my plan is kinda waiting him to get over his feeling on his crush, while also spending more time with him hanging out and doing some pastry together in the weekend. After some time, I wanna ask him out for a dinner on Christmas. I really don't know if I really stand a chance. At least now I don't have to worry that he likes girls, which would be a very dead-end for me.

Anyway, I really don't know what to do. Please give me some advice and kindly share your thoughts.

Recently, she began dating someone else but has made clear that the relationship isn‚Äôt permanent, that she is emotionally unavailable and that she is emotionally invested in our relationship and that he knows about this. She‚Äôa talked about how dating this person will help her trust her instincts again and work towards us getting back together after everything I did to her in our relationship, and that it will show her how to properly be treated by me. I personally feel like this is an excuse, and is her pushing me to the side as an option or second choice for when she eventually comes home. We have both talked about the fact that we would not be compatible together in an LDR, and that is fine, but I feel like this opens the door for her to move on from me entirely, even though she has consistently stated it isn‚Äôt permanent and that she wants to be with me when she gets back. I asked her if she was only reaching out because the relationship with him was not going well, but she stated that it in fact is and she stays over his place and works together with him, but that he is ‚Äúnot me‚Äù and cannot compare.

Recently, she had talked about the possibility of extending her internship to another half a year. I told her this makes me uncomfortable, especially with her dating someone else, and to compromise. She eventually did, and stated she took a demotion so that she could come back in two months and be together with me, but that she still wants to see who she is seeing for the reasons stated above. I don‚Äôt really know wha to do, nor have I heard of this situation before. She has talked about it being common for people to break up and date other people before getting back together, but this feels different and makes me feel inadequate as well, regardless of our past. At the same time, it‚Äôs only a two month wait (she declined to extend). I definitely feel like an option or like I was pushed to the side though. I told her how I felt replaceable and how her choice hurt me especially as she had talked about wanting to get back with me this entire time, and she told me she could not believe me for saying that, and that if she felt that way she would have blocked me and never spoke to me again, and that she wants to come home to be with me and to try to understand how she feels for once. Since then, she‚Äôs ignored me anytime I try to reach out.

I‚Äôm doing my best to, but this situation feels like a mess, and while I appreciate her being transparent and openly communicating with me, I don‚Äôt know how to feel about any of this. It feels like any day I can get a message from her between now and the next two months telling me she wants to seriously commit to him. I don‚Äôt know how to feel. I‚Äôve had my life on hold for months at this point hung up over our relationship and these developments, and I feel like this has only created a more toxic situation. She says to wait until then, but I can feel my resolve waning each day thinking about her spending time with someone who isn‚Äôt me. I don‚Äôt know if this is a rebound or not, and I worry that every day I‚Äôm another step closer to being forgotten or things falling apart.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1128646,public,self,In a toxic situation with my ex,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qzg39k/in_a_toxic_situation_with_my_ex/,no_ads,0,,,,,,

In the beginning of this year I made a post in r4r that blew up. I lost access to the account and never saw all the messages I received. 

Now:
A month ago I received a message request on my main account from a guy that used details from my original post and found my main account,since I never responded on the alt acc. 

He texted me he is sorry he is contacting me this way and understands if I didn't want to respond,but he couldn't stop thinking of that post. He has sent his letter to the alt. account two months ago, then texted the account a month later saying he read the book I mentioned in my post, then weeks later found my main account. Even though the way he found me is  technically stalking, I asked him to send me the letter he sent on the alt acc. 

To keep it short, what he wrote is the best thing I've ever read. I loved his responses, the amount of effort was insane, he was really funny, witty, thoughtful and we have too many things in common. Just everything I could wish for. We started texting and have been for the last month. 

I think he is great, except that he always screenshots all the pictures he is sending me and I find it really weird. He said it is because he doesn't want his location on the internet. 

He also says he is ""nervous af"" for a video call date (long distance). Which I don't understand because he is beautiful and hot af. He keeps saying ""I'm not saying never, but for now I don't feel comfortable"". I am starting to think he is in a living situation and is hiding me, or he is not the person from the pictures he sent me. We got into an argument over it and he said it's an insecurity of his, he is afraid he will forget a word in English and would look like a fool. I reassured him multiple times if he forgets we'll laugh it out and google it. 

Am I overreacting and being too suspicious?

Feels pretty strange still to be honest. But, I really need some honest 3rd party opinions. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being irrational/crazy or if I need to stand up for myself. Thanks in advance!

Here‚Äôs the situation. I‚Äôve been doing long distance with a girl for the last year and a half. We live far away, so we only see other like once a month. We love each other a lot. We‚Äôre both 23, and we‚Äôve discussed marriage and moving in together. We both want it a lot!

We talk every day. We text FaceTime/ call / Snapchat / or whatever social media stuff throughout the day. Probably 6 months in, we started falling asleep on FaceTime together. Kinda cool to end each day just us. 

I don‚Äôt want to make this post long, but here‚Äôs the issue. When we first started talking, we talked a lot, and had a lot to say. To me, the effort was 50 - 50. I asked about her, she asked about me, and it was just blatantly obvious we both wanted to keep talking. As things have progressed throughout the months, things slowly changed. Our texts became kinda dry, and our phone calls / FaceTime started getting more comfortable. She would be on instagram or texting her friends, and I‚Äôd be hanging out myself.

I started worrying that she was losing interest. I have a single point of trauma from a girl leaving me in the past, and I started getting really worried I was losing this girl too. And I knew I couldn‚Äôt lose her. 

So I talked to her about it. I told her like hey, we aren‚Äôt taking as much anymore.. I acknowledged that the honey moon phase needs to end and that I‚Äôm not trying to be needy, but just wanting to check in to make sure that your still happy and that I‚Äôm not losing you..  

She told me that she is just quiet. She loves me so much, and loves how easy our relationship is. She said she knows I‚Äôm the right one because of how easy it is, and how comfortable she is around me. She likes being on FaceTime ‚Äújust hanging out‚Äù and that she isn‚Äôt going anywhere. 

I felt great. I was like, ‚Äúwell that went great!‚Äù Until a few weeks later. I started worrying again. We talked, she tried to say the same thing, a little frustrated that I was bringing it up again, but all good. 

Then again, and again. It‚Äôs been probably 4 or 5 times now and she gets really pissed when I bring it up. 

I‚Äôm writing this (unfortunately long) post because I don‚Äôt know what to do. Am I being unfair to her? Is she being unfair to me? I just want to know she loves me, and wants to be with me. I want her to flirt and be sweet. Like duh? Who the fuck doesn‚Äôt want their girlfriend to do that. I feel like I don‚Äôt need her to be a legit radio, but like you can‚Äôt ask me how I am or how my day is? Sometimes I feel like I just ramble on and she sits there. It‚Äôs like, do you like me, or do you just not want to be alone?

I tell her this and she doesn‚Äôt get it. She refuses to take any fault and thinks that ‚Äúit‚Äôs all in my head.‚Äù She thinks that she‚Äôs been the same ‚Äúlevel of quiet‚Äù this entire time and ‚Äúis super sweet and nice to you all the time‚Äù and keeps dropping the whole BS line of like ‚Äúseems like you should date someone else because I‚Äôm not ever going to change. I‚Äôm just no talkative so‚Äù

Some part of me feels like I‚Äôm being gaslit. Like she‚Äôs not taking any responsibility, not caring about how I feel, and not putting effort in. Another part of me thinks, that‚Äôs just how she is. It‚Äôs your problem, you need to realize she does love you, always has, AND even though it may be dry and different convos now, she texts you ever day and FaceTimes you every night. So stop being needy, and get your fucking head on straight. 

I try to do that, and it never works. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve had this talk and now fight over and over again. I don‚Äôt want to break up. I don‚Äôt think she does either. We love each other a lot, but this is obviously a big deal to me. I mean come on, I‚Äôm writing an essay on Reddit!

Ever since my first day, he has always been helpful to me. He helped me, reminded me of my break times, asking to walk to punch out for going home together. This is a big deal as I didn't expect this treatment because its opposite gender helping me and his aisle is actually very far from mine. So he had to walk all the way to do all those.

I find him good-looking but found out he has a girlfriend. Our other colleagues also knows he has a girlfriend. Despite of this, our colleagues have been teasing for us to get together because I'm single and they don't take his relationship w/ his girlfriend seriously. The latter is because the girlfriend is a person he knew from online and they only started dating during COVID time - therefore, they haven't met eachother irl. 

However, since our colleagues have just started teasing us together, he has been way more approachable (?) to me. For example, when he's done with his work, he walked to my aisle and had a 1-1 conversation. Before this, it was just one sentence or walking together. But since the teasing, we talked longer. I also reciprocated to avoid awkwardness and walked to his aisle to have his conversation.

The teasing started one month ago and we got closer since. Today is his birthday. I greeted him in advance yesterday because today is our offday. I do not have his number just because we haven't had any reason to exchange numbers. When I greeted him, he jokingly said where's my present? and when I asked him his plans, he didn't have any. I didn't have the courage to schedule a hangout together and celebrate his birthday. 

My question is should I buy him a birthday gift - nothing major, just like a chocolate he likes and a handwritten birthday greet?

Why I'm questioning is because I feel like giving him present would signal more. I don't actually want to pursue us into a relationship because I don't see myself staying at this job for long. I don't see us together because his status (like education, financial) is not to my stability standard. But I feel bad for not buying him gift. Plus, if he's still together with his girlfriend and they broke up for me, I would feel bad to break up with him and now he's alone.

One of my friends found out and when I confronted her she denied it but I found out it was true after seeing him on her social media so I deleted her off everything even though she tried messaging me just before her wedding.

She eventually ended up getting divorced a year in to her marriage, that was around 5 years ago.

Around last year we got back in touch and we got back together as she seemed to have changed a lot, but a while in to the relationship she revealed that she did have quite a few boyfriends before then and that she had slept with a few.

I was understanding and things seemed to be going fine after and we even planned for marriage, but then I noticed how much of a rush she was in to get married and how she said she always misses me. But lately we have argued a lot and she has really wound me up to the point where I didn't want to speak to her, she knew I wanted my space but to get my attention she ended up blocking me off everything.

When I asked why she blocked me she said she didn't want me to have access to her if I can't commit to her, even though she has a lot of random guys on there! She eventually unblocked me.

My own family wasn't happy about my relationship as my mother wasn't keen on her but I eventually persuaded her to accept (I realise now how stupid I was).

A few months later, I noticed her being open again about other guys but instead of saying anything I stayed quiet. When she asked why I was quiet, she insisted that I can talk to her about anything so I told her that I wasn't happy with how open she is with other guys, she then went on to say how she didn't want to be with someone that is insecure as her ex husband was the same.

I was quite annoyed at this point as she has said herself in the past that she is insecure too and she always had mood swings and emotional issues due to her endometriosis which I was always understanding of, it hurt that she couldn't be understanding of my mental health. So then she went on to complain about me not committing to her, at this point I had enough of it and said that if she wants to end it she should do it now so she went ahead and blocked me off social media.

She didn't block my number but now I have blocked hers so she can't get in touch with me. I told my mother that we had broken up so she shouldn't get in touch with her mother to sort wedding arrangements, at that point my mom informed me that she rang her mom a couple of weeks ago but she said that she was busy and and that she would ring back later which she never did.

I was tempted to unblock her and have a go at her for saying that I was the reason things weren't progressing. But I though forget it, I no longer want anything to do with her anymore.

I dated a guy for several years and thought it was forever: love, children, family‚Ä¶

It all started in early June, when I bought a test. And... two stripes. The next morning ‚Äì the same result. My hands began to shake, tears welled up in my eyes, and my stomach ached sharply. I sat down on the floor and cried, not understanding whether it was tears of joy or great grief for me then. One thing was spinning in my head: ""What should I do?

When I informed my lover about the pregnancy, he said that he didn't care whether it was an abortion or ""you're going to give birth."" Will you!? Why not ""we will""? There was indifference in his eyes.

The next day I went to the clinic. A gynecologist met me and performed an ultrasound with undisguised disgust‚Ä¶ I was told to come back in a week and bring the money. During this time, my beloved turned away from me, only gave the announced amount and left.

This week dragged on like an eternity. I couldn't sleep at night, and in the morning I was so sick of worries that I couldn't get out of bed. I didn 't want to eat at all‚Ä¶

During the second ultrasound, I was shown a small ""speck"" on the screen. I heard the words of a gynecologist that I will never forget: ""Look, this is your baby, it's developing so well and growing fast."" I was afraid‚Ä¶

After 10 minutes I took a pill, and the next morning I was told to go back to the clinic. When I got home, I called my boyfriend and, sobbing, told him everything, but I didn't hear any reaction on the phone. It was very insulting to me, because I would never have thought that our child would change it so much.

The next day my gynecologist was already waiting for me with a bunch of pills. I drank them, and they took me to the operating room. An hour later, my blood began to run so that I didn't have time to change the pads. I was afraid to tell the doctor and kept hoping that the blood would stop. Then the doctor came in and saw a mountain of pads, quickly put me on a chair and let me shove something into the uterus so that it opens. I screamed at the whole department in pain. And the doctor only covered my mouth with his hand and constantly said: ""Shut up, you fool, she agreed."" Then he made me jump with all my might so that the fetus would come out by itself.

My eyes couldn't see anything from crying, my legs were giving way, I was tired, I couldn't do it anymore. And suddenly I felt something fall out of me and blood flowed down my legs with terrible force. The doctor was delighted and took me to his office.

This is where the most terrible thing began: he took tweezers, opened the pouch and took out my baby from there. I lost consciousness‚Ä¶

It was very far for me to get home, I had the last money in my pocket for a minibus and one gasket, which would obviously not be enough for me, since I changed them every five minutes. I dialed the number of my beloved and said: ""Dimochka, pick me up, I can't get there myself, I'm bleeding."" ""Yana, I'm working,"" he cut me off.

I beg everyone who reads my story, believe me and everyone else who has experienced it for themselves‚Ä¶ Do not take the life of your baby!

We were never official and we never really considered each other boyfriend and girlfriend but we acted like we were in a relationship. 
We met on tinder and we told each other how unexpected it was that we will find someone we have such a strong connection with on a dating app. 
He was always so cute, sent me cute texts, told me he liked me, I was exactly what he needed in his life, and basically I was just the perfect woman he could have met. 
I sent him a text to ask him if we could see each other soon to which he replied ¬´¬†No¬†¬ª and he then said ¬´¬†I didn‚Äôt miss you so I guess it is what it is¬†¬ª. 
Keep in mind that he told me a week before that that he was excited to see me again.
My heart shattered. I really fell in love with him and had a lot of my first times with him, I gave him my whole and right now I just feel like what I did wasn‚Äôt good enough and I could have kept him closer even if I know I did nothing wrong. 
I put a lot of efforts in this relationship and he pretty much knew he had me in the palm of his hands, I always was more invested than him in some way. 
I can‚Äôt stop thinking about him. I keep waking up at night, I can‚Äôt eat, I can‚Äôt imagine myself doing anything except lying in bed. 
He was what occupied my mind for the last couple of months and now I just feel so empty because I can‚Äôt think about him without hurting but also I don‚Äôt know what else to think about.

In december i called her out of the blue when she was in a relationship and she didn t respond. After some time i saw that she isn t in a relationship anymore so i had to release my guilt of me ignoring her so i can move on in peace. I called her again and i said that i don t want to lose her, she is a very special person to me and in case something bad happens, to reach out for support but she didn t said that she wants it too, she was in silence, we just had a friendly conversation.. that was at the end of april this year. And the thing is i always have the assumption, idk why, that i didn t fight for her to keep her in my life at least, cuz i know that we shouldn t be together now because of the circumstances. This thought that i didn t do enough to keep her in my life it stresses me like hell guys.

How can i move on completely with the feeling  that she reached out multiple times when i ignored her and i just reached out once in return, the feeling that 3,4 times vs 1 time is not enough??

We are both Uni students. Had a call that night (Friday) and met up with her and her friend for dinner the day after (Saturday) and held hands when going back home. That night we called and she said we wanted to focus on me and told me that she messaged her other days saying to be friends cuz she doesn't wanna hold hands with someone and see other people. And I said I wanted to focus only on her as well. Then met up with her on Monday (kissed in a park that night) + Thursday + Saturday (she invited me to go picnic with her friends).

In the week we basically acted as if we were in a relationship, messaging a whole lot, using heart emojis, FaceTiming, saying I miss you but never I love you. We bonded over the fact we both broke up in July (got dumped), devastating heartbreak, and now knows how a healthy relationship should be, both christians. When we met up she said she liked my company, really liked me, said I was brave and cute. She also told me she was really afraid to fall in love and get serious cuz of her past relationship so she might be a bit slow (1 day after we matched), and I told her I totally understand cuz thats me as well and she said she will do her best to not hurt me and says there's something special with us. But then she was the one who took the lead in setting the fast pace (she initiated all the meet ups, asked to pin her chat on WhatsApp with heart emojis beside my name and be romantic in chatting).

But this morning she messaged me saying she was overwhelmed, saying we were moving too fast, she wants to take things slow. Asked me we are just friends right? Wants to keep our options open, not settle and meet new people and get to know each other and see what happens, but also wants to keep meeting up and everything. She then said lets delete our WhatsApp chats and restart from scratch which we did. Cuz in her previous relationship (4 years + engagement ring) they got together within a week, and her mum and bro said she needs to play hard to get, that we were moving too fast. (My gut feeling was that during our FaceTime last night my mum came in pissed that I was FaceTiming so late and she said it scared her and she hates confrontation (maybe that's why she says this?)

But earlier last week she was asking me am I the type of person of waits months to ask to be official, and when I said I take couple weeks and do you want me to ask she said its up to you cuz your the boy. She suggested to have sex in a hotel on thurs saying it would connect us more, but then the next day say she changed her mind and wanted to wait until we were in a relationship. She also asked if she was going to be my rebound, but when I asked her if I was her rebound she says no cuz she's completely over her ex now, never wants him back and happy he's not in her life (blocked) and sees me as an upgrade for him.

So basically, I don't know what to do, should I back off and no contact until she comes back? HELP

In my area at least, it is full of copy/paste people who have no personality beyond what alcohol they like and mostly tend to match and ignore. I don't doubt there are decent people using it still, but it's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

I migrated over to Hinge a few months back, and I'm finding the quality of people on that app and their willingness to put effort in to making conversation yields much better results than Tinder, with the trade-off being it's a little bit slower paced. Also it shows you who likes you and allows you to match them without needing a premium account, and the recommend profiles section somehow actually shows me women I like the style of (boho girls, geeks, house plant lovers). 

Just for context: I have a very specific type. I am an introverted and boho type of guy with long hair who doesn't drink, smoke, do drugs, or want kids. I have a LOT going against me for meeting somebody likeminded as most people want kids and love going out where I'm from, not to mention that my appearance and style isn't what the majority of women are into (and I'm okay with that). I've had decent success so far meeting people I click with on there, can't say the same for Tinder.

Anybody here struggling on dating apps who is a little more on the introverted or alternative side, I recommend trying it out. You'll get less likes or matches and it'll take longer, but from my experience as somebody who has failed on Tinder for years, Hinge has gotten me results. I've managed to meet somebody who ticks all of my very specific and weird boxes, so I recommend people make a profile that's honest and unapologetically themselves instead of playing it safe for mass appeal or the dopamine hit of ""you have a new like"" that tinder has gotten people addicted to.
