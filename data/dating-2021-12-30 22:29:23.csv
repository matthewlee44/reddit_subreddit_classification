I live in Aus, and It's full of tall fit handsome guys, and even average/below average girls have tall fit handsome guys lining up to date them, It's good for the women but It sucks for me here, and don't tell me It's in my head because I see it all the time. There's no hope for me here, my cousin meanwhile he looks exactly like me, It's pretty crazy actually lol, but he lives in Scotland and has a GF so It seems moving to the UK is my only chance at having a relationship. I'm about to complete my nursing qualification but the problem is most places require 2-3 years of experience minimum which means I'll be 26 when I'm able to date.

2,rsllh2,1640925654,Should I regret not kissing her?,"A

I meet A and hit it off, then get rejected because Im looking for someone who is not dating around in the pandemic (dont want to get sick). She is crazy beautiful. She is also a huge flake we always make plans but will cancel last minute everytime. We have same tastes in everything, and talk consistently over the year, in which she has several shitty boyfriends. She might not gf material but I defintely want to casually date her. While she has a bf, she introduces me to B.

B

She is nice but not my type, good friend, study partner for my last semester.
We hit it off and date, and were sexually active, but I break it off before graduation, but we're still friends, all good.

 ok 

I graduate, very proud of myself. Afterwards we met up and celebrate, and I accidently eat an edamame A has already ate (I totally forget, Im an idiot lol). Everyone eventually leaves or went to gamble, but I go home for an hour.

A invites me to come over and we have a great night. The whole time she is keeping distance, says she doesn't want a boyfriend for a while, and we are we are talking about B.  She says she feels a fever coming on (!!!). I gotta wake up in 7 hours, for a family brunch, and prepare for a long road trip. Im not not expecting to kiss her becasue she might be sick, and the vibe was off after talking about B. Im also almost dead tired.

We have a moment to kiss, but I dont take it. I almost wanted to, but I was confused and tired and didn't to get sick, or make it awkard before I leave on a week trip. As she shows me to the door and under her breathe she says she was ""too horny""(?). We make plans to hangout and take roadtrip, after my trip, and take another flight to see a mutual friend.

I see my family all the next day (day 1: I wouldn't be contagious, thank god). A tests positive, I wont test positive for a week but I feel kind of ill and decide to stay. We talk in quarantine says she wishes we could see each other but I dont know if I am positive. Soon, I get REALLY sick, since I hadnt had my booster. I sleep for like 4 days straight. In whish I test positive. 

As soon as she tests negative, she meets someone online across the country and invites them over to stay the weekend. I feel like an idiot. I feel like shit, physically and mentally. I have a huge pang of regret. There is so many details and I feel like I failed in everyway.

8,rsm1po,1640927165,"Made a great connection with someone, planned a date and am getting ghosted. Need advice","Here’s the story. And it’s a long one so here’s your warning. Basically I am wanting to know should I call the date off because of how she isn’t replying, or should I wait things out because she could genuinely be too busy to text back. 

So yes it begins with a ONS, but that doesn’t matter because what matters, to me at least, was before and after that. I went to the bars with my roommate and ran into my brother out there. Hung out with him and his friends and at one point one of his best friends sisters, she’s a year younger than I am, either mentioned or something that she thought I was hot. Fast forward to the next bar we were at and her and I are just sitting there talking, and we had a phenomenal connection, like one I’ve never had before with someone. Well we end up making out, and then as we leave she says to my brother “I love your brother” to which he replies “I know, I’ll see y’all at the wedding.” As if he knows something I don’t or can see something I don’t. We get to her place and I would have been completely fine just staying the night w/o sex. But that happened anyway. The next morning I tell her I need to leave and as I’m trying to get up she pulls me back in to make out some more and sleep some more. A little while later I get dressed and she pulls me in again to make out some more before I leave and I get her number and I ask her on a date. She then walked me out and made out some more at the door. Clearly I did something right if she didn’t want me to leave. We then start texting and plan a date for a Friday three weeks from then because Christmas was the next week, and she works as a night nurse so her schedule changes a lot. Well I really began to like her, although she sucked at replying and taking a day to reply sometimes, but I understood that because we’re both adults with adult jobs. She apologized for not replying much to which I said it was fine because I knew she was busy but she even recognized she wasn’t great at talking. This week she is in a wedding and I haven’t talked to her for some time, again giving her some leeway because her friends are in town. But she can post on her story kinda regularly and not text me back which is confusing. I asked her earlier in the week if we could move our date up because I really just wanted to see her. I suggested some days and she was busy because of the wedding, Friday her friends are still in town so she ‘might be busy’ and Saturday she said she would try to do something but doesn’t know if she will be sad from her college football team losing in their bowl game. What I don’t get is that clearly we had a great connection because others saw it too, she didn’t want me to leave and then she goes from replying kinda often to almost never. Our date is planned for next Friday and I’m considering only waiting until next Wednesday and if we don’t have some decent conversation between then then I’ll call the date off because clearly something is wrong and she is showing no interest out of no where. Maybe I’m overthinking it because she’s just with friends and she just forgot to reply to my message, or maybe she genuinely lost interest. But if the latter were the case I’d want to know why so I don’t do that again. If someone could give some insight that would be great. 

TL:DR: Met a girl at a bar, had a GREAT connection, she didn’t want me to leave in the morning, we began texting and the time between replies became longer and longer. I only understand because of her work schedule and her friends are in town for a wedding she’s in and her dad was in town for Christmas. But now it seems as if she’s uninterested.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rsm1po/made_a_great_connection_with_someone_planned_a/

LDR,"Me (23F) and my ex boyfriend (24M) had been in a LDR for around 8 months after being together for around 1.5 years together irl, and recently broke up around 2 weeks ago, we decided things weren’t going as planned, we barely talked to each other since we have an 7 hour difference, and it was more worrying than satisfying. There had also been problems between us and with our own selves, we’ve been both depressed and not in our best. We still love each other, but we think it might be best if we keep some time apart to grow separately, get into our hobbies, and just do better in life in order to have a better relationship and be able to get back together. 
I’m still not sure this is the best decision but we’re desperate to feel better. We still talk sometimes about “important” stuff in our days, we’re thinking this genuine interest might be able to make us closer. 

I miss him so much and the pain of not being able to be together is unbearable. He feels the same way but doesn’t think we should be back together right away as time needs to heal some wounds between us. He wants me to be at my best, do things I enjoy and just be myself. We’re eager to feel better and have the chance to be together again but it’s not as easy. 

Is this a good decision?
Does anyone have any recommendations in order to make this work? Has anyone had the same experience?

19,rsnd5t,1640931791,Talked with a guy for more than 3 months only to get sucker punched in the soul,"Sorry for the long post, but I think this requires a good explanation. TLDR included at the end.

Met this guy on a dating app. We were in different countries at the time, but we connected almost instantly. Really similar personalities, world views and niche interests; it was seriously uncanny. And I’m not kidding when I say we talked every single day for almost 3 months. I genuinely liked him.

He complimented me, flirted with me, called me pet names like “bb” and “dear” and we had several deep conversations. We also called, FaceTimed, and watched shows together, so we got to know each other really well for two people who’d never even met in person. Checking my phone in the morning and talking to him every day felt natural. He even suggested we make a joint playlist with songs that reminded us of each other.

We made a list of things we wanted to do together once we met up in person, which was starting to become a reality as I’d just moved to his country as an exchange student (not because of him, though, this has been planned in advance for months) so it was a great opportunity to finally meet up in person. He even talked about getting plane tickets to come visit, so I was thrilled. This screamed budding long distance relationship.

However (there’s always a however) during the fourth month, he started replying less and less often, which I chalked up to him starting a new job. He’d often take anywhere from 2 to 8+ hours to reply to my messages, and every once in a while he wouldn’t reply for 1-2 days. Mind you, his job wasn’t even THAT demanding or high-pressure, and people I talked to concluded that even an ER doctor would have the time to reply more often than he did. 

One day, he let me know he bought a plane ticket to visit his friend, something he’d told me he’d been wanting to do for a while, and I was excited because we’d be geographically closer than before, so he could just fly down to where I was later.

In the meantime, our long, amazing conversations started becoming less and less frequent, which I missed. We stopped calling or watching shows altogether.

At one point, the uncertainty and mixed signals were too much to handle, and I considered asking him what was up, and if he was interested in a relationship in the future (I hadn’t brought it up earlier before because I didn’t want to scare him away at the beginning, especially considering he’d never seen me in person, but 3.5 months of doing all the stuff I mentioned above couldn’t have made it more obvious) so I finally decided to ask.

His first reply was:

“Wait, relationship??”

I ended up finding out that he wasn’t looking for something long distance, and that he was confused I’d brought up the topic of a relationship despite all the signs pointing towards one (the flirting, the pet names, deep conversations, written plans for the future, etc)

He also claimed he’d be happy keeping things as they were before, which I reluctantly agreed to because I genuinely enjoyed talking to him, but then he ended up ghosting me after a while. No goodbye, nothing. 

And that’s how I got the closure I needed but not the closure I wanted.

If you’ve read the whole thing, I appreciate it.

TLDR; Got really close to a guy I’d met on a dating app, talked almost every day for for 3 months only to find out that the thought of a relationship hadn’t even crossed his mind despite his words and actions saying otherwise.

Me and my bf has been online dating for almost a year now. Everything is going so well but the only thing that is bothering me is that he doesnt wanna show his face. He sent me pics of him when he was a kid and a pic that barely showed his face (I could only see his eyes and hair). Everytime we video call, I am the only one who will turn on the camera. He did turn it once and showed me his face, for like 5 seconds and thats it. Everytime I talk to him about it, he would say he isnt ready to but idk how long should I wait. He said its not because he's uncomfy but he's just insecure. But to be insecure with your own gf that u you've been dating for almost a year is ridiculous if you ask me. And I don't see him making an effort to show me since I never forced him to show his face etc. Idk what to do.. Do I leave him or what T.T

p/s I can assure you guys he isn't a predator or catfishing. I enjoy his personality and he treats me nicely.

21,rsnkq7,1640932573,Should I lose our mutual friends after our breakup?,"Okay so my ex and I were friends before anything else happened, we met abroad and we have a group of friends from different parts of the world. We broke up last March but things were complicated and we kept talking for a bit, then stopped from two months and they contacted me again in a really toxic way (crying telling me they kissed someone) after all of that we had a huge fight on my birthday which ended up with them blocking me and I decided I didn't want anything to do with them ever again and deleted their number. That was in October and everything was fine. Ups and downs ofc but mostly I've felt like I'm really getting over them.

One of the people in our friend group is their best friend since kindergarten so I knew that our breakup meant I lose that friendship as well but I was okay with that. The weird thing is that today, almost 3 months after our breakup their best friend removed me from Instagram which I find very weird. Why this long after? My ex doesn't really open up so I figured maybe they just told her what happened until now but our fight was mostly them insulting me in the worst possible way and me crying. Now I can't stop thinking what did they say about me since back in March their best friend didn't remove me. My ex is closer to most people on our friend group than I am and even though no one but her best friend knew we were a couple they knew we were close so I'm scared they are making up stuff and making me look bad. 

We both made mistakes in our relationship but I've always been of the idea of not talking bad about my exes specially not to friends we have in common since my relationship with them has nothing to do with theirs. I don't feel comfortable now with the rest of my friends and since we just have a group chat we occasionally talk in I'm thinking of just deleting it.

So basically, I've never touched a woman's body..Now, I have a career, I have money for Uber, I'm kinda confident in myself now that I have money and good clothes..I still feel mentally and emotional stunted because I've never had a GF.  


I met an older woman on Hinge. She is kinda interested in me..I kinda feel like a sociopath because I'm telling her what she wants to hear so I can get what I want - sex. But I also have a conscience, I dont want to just use her for sex.

Instead we talked and I said I feel it's too soon, let's get lunch first. 


Right now, if it's up to me, I want to prolong this experience even if I don't have any feelings for her just to experience. We chat over facetime but I really get any sparks from her..if it's up to me, she will end things because I'm also too scared to say hey, I'm not getting any sparks, do you want to just be friends?

Where and how could I meet single ones interested in someone so young?"," I have more natural conversations with them and feel safer. Women my age I usually am instantly turned off by their immaturity and lack of morals. Not to toot my own horn but I'm very mature for my age so I have very little friends at all and mostly keep to myself. I am an empath so it's very difficult to be around people my age when they are usually pretty negative/selfish and or going through so much that it seeps in to my bubble. (not saying older people are perfect but they usually have boundaries).

Honestly I'd love to experience a fling with mature women of course, but I think I'm interested in maybe dating too. Either way... I have had no luck finding any that are SINGLE. Moms I meet (and I say moms because I haven't found an older girl without kids) are usually always married or have tons of kids. I may be interested to experiment but I'm not heartless and I don't want to ruin marriages. I've tried night clubs but I haven't really had any luck there as the ones I find are usually very wholesome and non sexual or non romantic. Ironically.

Some background info on me. I've only been in 4 relationships. My longest was 2 years. Shortest was about 4-5 months. I believe in soulmates. I have an average body, not unhealthy just average skinny look. I am goth and very punky. I'm feminine especially with my style. Easiest way to explain me is Im a goth femboy. I have a job at skyzone which ironically is a gold mine for moms, but they are always married or with a ton of kids so I feel bad asking them about dating. LOL. I am very kinky, and love to be, but I AM A VIRGIN. Saving it for marriage. Yes I have had plenty of opportunities and I turned them down (Previous gfs and one night stand type stuff). My favorite things to do are making videos/editing, streaming, gaming, fashion, shopping and collecting films or going on random spontaneous adventures and road trips!

So I'm hoping their might be some milfy women on here who could perhaps give me some pointers, tips and tricks please and thank you!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rso3js/im_21_and_like_milfs_not_just_sexually_but/
30,rsoben,1640935418,I don't know what to reply.....,"I posted this a few hours ago.

""I was supposed to meet up with my fwb, who I have seen only three times over the past year, mainly due to him cancelling all the time. About two hours before our scheduled meet up, I asked him how he was feeling (just wanted to check if he had covid symptoms). He didn’t reply. Twenty minutes before, I asked if I should start getting ready. He finally replied with, “No. I’m not feeling well.” Here's how the conversation went,

Me: ”was it so hard to text me an hour ago?.”

Him: “I haven’t been feeing well. Sorry.”

Me: “is it covid? do you need a rapid test?”

Him: “No, I don’t think so.”

Me: ""Does it boost your ego to get me to say yes and then bail on me?""

Him: ""Wtf. No.""

This is when I started feeling like it’s just another way to bail out on me. Previously, he’s used a variety of ways. Out of anger, I blocked him right away but I can’t stop feeling bad and wondering what if he's really sick. The cases of omicron are really increasing where I live and I really like him but I just couldn't handle him bailing on me again. He seemed really excited when we were planning it on Tuesday. Did I do the right thing? Should I add him back? I really don't know what to do ;(""

Everyone in the comments made me feel so guilty to the point of me adding him back and saying sorry.

His response was ""Man. Please. I'm not feeling good."" So I felt really bad and suggested that it could be covid and I offered to drop a COVID test. He just said ""No. It's not COVID. Just not feeling it. Moody.""

When he asked about my ethnicity I lied and didn't tell him the truth after a few months we were talking. Growing up I was always embarrassed about my ethnicity because of the negative stereotypes about it. I did lie to him again before we met about my address. I didn't feel comfortable giving him my address on the first date so I gave him my old address. I was worried about him stalking me. I know I had the choice not to tell him. I apologized.

40,rspd52,1640939556,"Guys, Just be honest (slight nsfw)","(NSFW because of mentions of arousal &amp; masterbation)

I'm at a stage in my life that I know how I've been awkward and weird about wanting to be in a relationship, I honestly think I've obsessed over it in the past just because I've felt so lonely and want someone to spend time with. I'm trying to be better, And im trying to be more honest about it not just for the one's I want in my life but for myself too. The internet can be an amazing tool to find countless amounts of amazingly helpful information, but it can also be used to fuel unhealthy habits. 

I've sent my unrightful share of odd texts and such, All because of a some hormones that make me wanna feel good. My best advice to you guys is to either rub it out and be over with it or let it subside, But whatever you do DO NOT send dm's, texts, pictures, or whatever else you might be thinking about while you're in that mood. You very well may regret it and it doesn't take very long for it to build into a selfloathing pit in your stomach. You can also ruin friendships and even your reputation with just one untastful message.

I feel like I'm partly just venting here, But if anyone can take away from this i hope you get that it's okay to have those feelings and urges but you can't let them control or consume you, They aren't what you should want to be in a relationship for. Having a significant other has to start with polite and honest intentions. You should be looking for someone to get to know, to share in conversations with, to build a healthy relationship with and actually be able to love.

But my resolution to finally find my first girlfriend didn't happen again in 2021. I have to watch two couples kissing at the New Year's Eve party tonight. I don't begrudge them their happiness, but as an unkissed virgin I also wish to be desired by a woman and to gain first sexual experiences. 

All I want is a girlfriend with whom I can spend time, go to the movies, theater or museum together, cook, discuss about the world and watch Netflix. Preferably of the nerdy introverted student next door type.

What I have tried to change in 2021:
My work environment, circle of friends and hobbies are unfortunately pretty male-dominated. So I need to look elsewhere.

So I signed up on Bumble and Tinder. I didn't think it would be hard at first. After all, I'm actually not a bad overall package and I don't have huge requirements when it comes to looks. But far from it as an average guy. With better photos and Tinder Premium I managed to get a few likes and matches. But everyone left me with ""the evening with you was nice, but I didn't feel the spark"" after the first or second date. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I tried asking the women for feedback but never got an honest answer. 

In real life, I have tried to go to more events despite the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. However, I continue to have a hard time approaching women as an introvert with slightly autistic traits. Especially since hardly anyone else seems to do that either? At parties and in the disco under the influence of alcohol it went a little better, although there I always have to screen for the type of woman who looks like she was dragged along by girlfriends. These events are actually not my passion.

Is anyone in a similar situation? Or have any more advice on what else I could try? Where can I find you nerdy introverted college girl next door in real life? Wishing you all a healthy new year!

I have also been in a relationship with a gaslighter who claimed he loved me one day and the next day he acted like he did not even like or respect me depending on his mood, so I have trouble trusting potential partners. That relationship ended 2 years ago and I have only recently started dating again because I was really scared to put myself out there again. 

A few weeks ago I met this great guy and we’ve been spending a lot of time together. When I am actually with him I barely feel anxious anymore and two days ago we had sex for the first time, which was really nice. Afterwards though, I kept replaying everything in my head and picking it apart. Mostly just convincing myself that everything I said and did was wrong and weird and everything he said and did was a lie and he was faking being into me, etc. 
I’ve been in enough therapy for my anxious thought patterns to know it’s really not healthy to fill in other peoples thoughts like that, but I don’t know how to stop myself. It is driving me crazy and it causes me so much stress that a big part of me just wants to end things. 

I also think I’m having a hard time getting used to being treated well by a partner (which is pretty sad to admit honestly). This guy is constantly checking in with how I am feeling and stuff like that and he’s very cuddly.

I didn’t even meet a potential friend that lasted. The goal was to find my first-ever relationship. Silly, I know when it comes to online dating. Idk why I thought I would get any luck when my efforts are just as bad in real life. 

For example, many of the guys I run into put on this dramatic facade in an attempt to get sexual pleasure from me. Knowing fully what my intentions are when I make them very clear. Then their lies catch up, and their true self starts to show. When it happens, it almost feels sinister; it’s kind of disturbing. I just needed a mental break. 

However, there is one guy [23M] I’m talking to who’s my last effort before I focus on myself. My hopes aren’t high bc like I stated before, his facade is showing. I caught feelings for him from the first phone call. We talked for hours and hours ever since. He’s a manager for a restaurant and never has time for me. When we chat, it’s always late at night. We canceled the first date I planned due to this. We both have busy lives, so I try not to take it as a red flag. 

He’s a sweetheart and takes note of every word I say. He’s a genuine Cancer guy of few words. He states he’s an introvert like me, doesn’t do much, and is at a stage of life where he’s only dating for potential marriage. However, when he talks about his past life, he’s far from introverted, in my opinion. He’s from a city up north that’s plagued with violence.
Consequently, he’s a product of his environment and made some bad decisions he regrets. Not bad enough for jail time and stuff. Noting how the people in his life at the time were bad influences, and he’s cut ties to become better. In our first phone chat, he felt comfortable enough to talk to me about his brother passing due to gun violence very recently and his failed relationship/engagement with his ex of 6+ yrs. He seems like a guy who is hurting, you know. 

I love hearing his voice, and we literally talk about our lives and anime all day. Just through the phone, I feel like I’m lying on his chest having a conversation. He’s very consistent, and I really like him. I liked him so much that when I first sensed we were distancing, I popped up at his job, lmao. I was so emotional about it to the point of tears! I was trying to give whatever we had going on my all, you know! He was like my last hoorah before I chilled out. I seriously desired a relationship. 
But, anywho, I confessed my feelings for him like a dummy! It hasn’t even been a flipping month yet. He gave me free food and reassurance that he liked me too, which was nice. 

Despite this, the phone call we had the next day made me regret all of that. The conversation was going well until he casually told me has a girl coming over that night bc of family troubles. Then he asks me how I feel about casual dating; if that doesn’t scream a red flag idk what does! Like, I just told him I have feelings for him, and he says that shit! I instantly lost interest and thought he did too. Fast forward two days later, he’s blasting my phone as if that convo never happened and asking when I’m available for a date. I told him the last convo rubbed me the wrong way, and he gave up trying to explain himself and said he’d call me back. My emotions are just on a roller coaster rn. Am I tripping that I feel hurt? Should I ignore the previous convo and go the date? Is he playing with me? I’m just so sick of the mental stress that “dating” is putting me through. I am too sensitive for this crap.

Had the what do you want from dating talk after date 3 and where do you see this going after date 5 ...both went terribly, I brought up the topic and he was very much like let's just enjoy each others company, why do we have to put labels on it, what would change if we did? When I asked if I got with someone else he said I was free to but he wouldn't because he doesn't have time to. And he asked do I want him to care if I was seeing other people alongside? Is what I want commitment? He also said he's trying to find himself. Ngl this conversation realllllyyyyy put me off.

Im leaving the city soon so it would have been a LDR for a little bit anyway, I do enjoy my time with him a lot despite this. But I know I need to distance myself emotionally otherwise it will really hurt. I'm not going to bring up the topic again. 

In fairness to him, it's been 4 years since his last relationship which was toxic and he's not really dated since ...

The problem is I cannot find any reason to be with these women. I just can’t make myself attracted to them.

Like I’ve been on 4 dates with this one girl and she has a cool personality but I just cannot find her physically attractive. Like so much so, the first time we tried to have sex I had to fake like I had something because I couldn’t get excited by her.

Another girl I hooked up with afterward just made me feel gross. She had bad hygiene and grooming and it was just overwhelming. 

I’m trying my best to be able to like them physically, but I just cannot.

This one girl I had to end things with was honestly just completely physically unattractive to me and I had to force myself to go on dates with her since I didn’t want to see her.

Long story short: I'm far too shy to initiate or to flirt with others, and whenever somebody initiates or flirts with me, it goes straight over my head because I'm dense as a brick and I don't realise until my friends point it out to me later.

I've realised that I should take a more active role in finding romance, so I've decided to sign up for Hinge. I don't have enough pictures of myself offhand to fill out the profile, so I need to take more. The problem is that, without being misleading or disingenuous, I can't think of any good pictures to take that actually represent me.

If the pictures on my profile were of me doing what I do for a living, doing what I do as a hobby, doing what I do socially among friends, and doing what I do to relax, I'd have a profile with pictures of me sitting at the computer, sitting at the computer, sitting at the computer, and sitting on the couch (to spice things up a bit).

I have hobbies and passions that I'd be happy to share and talk about, but they all take place in front of a keyboard-- it's difficult to make that seem as exciting or glamorous as it is to me.

67,rsuhhg,1640959167,She has a straight guy best friend?,"Long story short (this is my first ever reddit post so please bear with me)

Me and this girl have been dating for about 6 months now. We’ve had some on/off moments that have only lasted briefly however our relationship has been very intense and passionate during its course. We’ve gone out on dates, have slept together numerous times. She’s even met a few of my friends and immediate family that I live with. Her friends and family know of me and have even been acquainted with me through FaceTime or over the phone.

Several issues that we’ve run into in the past (almost) always involve my issues with trust in her. I always assume the worst in a relationship, either that she doesn’t love me as much as she says or she isn’t being faithful towards me.

This past week she’s been over my house with me spending the night and everything has been fine up until she was getting ready to leave. She stays an hour away from where I reside and she isn’t driving her vehicle at the moment so she asks one of her best friends to give her a ride home. Her friend is a straight male that she’s been friends with since high school. He’s been there during her previous relationship and according to her there hasn’t been any issues from her ex regarding their friendship.

The day after Christmas her and her friend went to go see the new Matrix film which she told me she was going to go see with her friend however it wasn’t until after she got home from being at my house this week that I find out that it’s her straight guy best friend that both took her out to the movies and dropped her off at home. She has three BFs apparently. One straight, one gay, and one bisexual. I was under the impression that it was her gay best friend being that she always mentions that person rather than her straight BF. 

She says that since HS this person (straight BF) has NEVER tried to hit on her or flirt NOT ONCE and the relationship is strictly platonic.

Right now I feel as though she is being deceptive and hiding stuff from the relationship and any time we try to talk about it it always devolves into an argument where either side has to be on defense. Right now I don’t know how to feel about her having a guy BF especially considering that I was unaware of his existence up until this point.

74,rsw3js,1640964016,Is my college friend of 3 years faking interest in me?,"My friend (M26) has been faking interest in me (F23) for a couple of months. Should I confront him on New Years Eve?


I have been friends with my college friend, A, for 3 years. I'm not gonna lie I've always found him attractive but he is kind of out of my league looks wise. I'm thin but below average attractive facially, never had male attention in my life and when I go out with female friends I'm a ghost. My life has been full of urequited crushes for years and thats how its going to be for the rest of my life, I don't think I will ever settle down due to looks requirements most guys have for their GF/wife.

I also believe he is out of my league because he probably has a lot of experience with women in his life yadayada.

Beginning of this year, with distance education and everything being closed down, I started talking to him more. We would chat on Snapchat, he would help me with school assignments, we would play LoL and other games and talk on Discord etc. It was funny. We would also have talks about politics and other stuff that were deeper. Suddenly this summer he asks me out on lunch. I can't go but come up with another time and date, and another activity. We go out to play minigolf, I meet his friends, a couple of weeks later we go out and play pool and have drinks etc. None of this is labeled dates. Before we meet up for pool he sends me a Snapchat selfie with lots of heart emojis. I have a bad feeling of it and don't respond or mention it.

Come september, he starts working at a bar/resturant for students and asks me to come there at his shift. I went there and talked to him for a while, it felt like he wanted to show off his bartender knowledge or something. The next day later that night at around 11-12 PM he texts me asking me to come there again but I'm already in bed so I can't.

The following months we are still writing to each other regularly, but the texts are being more suggestive and more flirty in tone. I go on with it, because this is the first time a hot dude is giving me any attention. However, one thing happens in school that makes me freak out about his intentions. He sits next to his friend and I walk past them and can hear his friend whisper my name in a low tone, but he probably didn't realize I heard it. This is when I'm thinking holy shit they are discussing me as a sexual conquest behind my back and laughing at me, because why else would his friend tease me in front of him?

However I also notice he is starting to play games as I disengage and go cold on him and hang out with other male friends. He asks curiously who I'm with when he sees my Snapchat stories of me hanging out with other guys. He later sends a pic of him and some other girl in the bar (probably his coworker), when otherwise he NEVER mentions other women in front me, never ever. Not even if I ask him. He starts flirting by calling me sweetie but backtracks when I ask if he is joking. Once I told him he is on my best friend list on Snapchat and he responded by sending a pic of him doing a heart with his hands and writing under ""best friends ❤️❤️❤️"" like its funny and I'm a moron. 

He also mentioned he was at a bar event he knows I like saying he lost in a music quiz and I was like so you went without inviting me? :( And he was like hehe did you want to? And I was like yeah and he replied true, ill give you my exam notes as an apology.
So he knows I like him and is teasing me like this? Not funny

He acts cold and hot but ALWAYS reaches out through Snapchat if I don't write anything to him for 1-2 days. Like yesterday he sent a pic of his cat asking me what I thought of it, after I had not sent anything for days. Stuff like that.


I'm meeting up with him on New Years Eve because I have to get some notes for my exam and I'm planning to confront him about his behavior and then cut him off. What should I say and how should I frame it?

I have a lot of girl friends and I was talking to them and one was talking about how she went on a few with a guy but ditched him when she found out he was a virgin at 22. 

She stated it was weird because if he couldn’t get a girl to have sex with him at before them it implied he had a lot wrong with him. I thought someone would say something but all the other girls there agreed. They all said they wouldn’t date someone who was really old virgin.

I’m the only virgin I know and I don’t want to make that public knowledge so I couldn’t question them on why they thought that, but I know it’s not an uncommon view. Being a virgin at my age is objectively considered weird.

Virgin is still a go to insult I see being used by my peers. And enough girls I know and see online are uncomfortable with being with guys that are virgins that it seems like I’m in a bad position.

going out to clubs /bars - i might be able to get a causal fling AT BEST, but most people in this settling aren't out for long term and more or less not the quality people you'd want to go into a long term relationship with

groups/meetup - i tried this as a last resort, but it sort of ties in with work. you dont want to mix in relationship. why? because if she rejects you, she'll let everyone know and then if you ask someone else , it'll just get messy. you'd be the guy hitting up every girl in the group instead of just being there to meet people and have a good time.

so with that said WHERE ELSE CAN I MEET PEOPLE? it seems online dating is the only viable option since the intentions are clear from the getgo, but i also have my reservations...",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rsxkg0/seems_impossible_to_meet_someone_after/

I (25m) matched online with a person (26F) a few days ago. Exchanged numbers and had vague plans to meet. I was exchanging banter and then I got the most unexpected reply. (See link to screenshot)

Was I way out of line or does she just have a fragile ego? I would have never expected somebody to take this so seriously or so personally. 

I followed up by stating that it was an honestly harmless joke and I obviously was never going actually do it (even if I did, it's pretty harmless). 

I then told her if she ultimately didn't like what I said (despite my apology) we can part ways amicably.


She even asked how old I was, like wtf!?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rsxqmq/is_she_overreacting_or_was_i_out_of_line/
87,rsxtaq,1640968890,maybe I don’t actually want a relationship? Or?,"My “break” from dating turned into a year long hiatus and I’m confused. I often think about how nice a relationship would be, but the thought of actually putting myself out there and going on dates doesn’t excite me. I think I’ve finally achieved the “happily single” phase of being single but then again am I happy single or just sick and tired of the dating cycle. I am 24 and sometimes I worry (at this rate) I’ll never meet someone. Just thinking about getting ready for a date, it possibly going badly and/or getting strung along for months is exhausting. 
I want to date to find a serious relationship and it feels like something casual is the default setting.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rsxtaq/maybe_i_dont_actually_want_a_relationship_or/
88,rsxuw0,1640969012,I (25M) literally don't know what to do next with this girl (25F),"I had a really wonderful date of my life. By far, this is literally the best date I've ever had. We watched a movie, lunch, and coffee together at that day. She was super excited, like she even told me that she dreamt about both of us go to that movie. Funny thing is we both asked to watch a movie literally at the same time, so it is not me asking her or the other way around.

At the movie she held my hands, she leaned to me, ""stealing"" my popcorn... We were like a couple on that day. She also told me lot of things in my car. It is the first time that I have a date with a girl who is more talkative than me (yes I am a chatty person). Unfortunately she have to get home early as she have family matters in that evening. I dropped her home, and she even turn back to see me twice before entering her home.

We chat a bit and she left something in my car. The date was on Saturday, and I told her I'd send it on Sunday (I can't send it myself because I have an errand), she said OK because on Monday she'll busy. After that, she disappeared. At first I thought she's with her family, so I wasn't thinking much about her. Next day, I send her thing but she says nothing (the driver dropped it in her house, received by her housemaid). She always said that she needs ""social recharge"" after socializing (she's a bit introvert, and she's been like this since the first time I know her) and she'd disappeared for a couple of days before she come back. All of her friends said the same thing about her, and they keep saying that she is a bit weird because of this ""disappear"" thing. At first I'm still fine about it, but she hasn't come back. On Wednesday, I texted her whether she received her thing or not, but still no replies. She hasn't active on her other social media as well. It's been a week and still nothing. I don't know what to do next. My friends said that I need to be more patient, but a week without any words from her? Like not even a single word?

90,rsy0fn,1640969436,Should I pursue going on a third date with this girl?,"The first date I (19M) had with her (18F) was really good, we chatted for 2.5 hours and it was so easy. No pauses, nothing. And I was really into her. 

Yesterday we went on a second date, and while we grabbed lunch and chatted for 4 hours, I felt that I wasn't as interested, or that the spark I had wasn't there from the first date. But I'm not sure if that was because I was having residual effects from getting my booster shot the day before and getting an abysmal sleep the night before that caused me to feel that way, because I can get pretty moody without sleep. 

We have a ton in common and she's super easy to talk to, like I can get pretty anxious sometimes but with her I'm never even slightly anxious, which is pretty rare with me. Should I pursue a third date with her just to see how things are? I'm worried that if I call it off based off of how I felt on yesterday's date (when I had very little sleep) I might regret it, but I don't want to lead her on or anything because she seems a bit more interested than me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rsy0fn/should_i_pursue_going_on_a_third_date_with_this/

We kissed etc, spoke about another date and after the first date we made a plan for New Year’s Eve. 

Last 24 hours she’s gone almost off grid. Not messaged at all even though I’ve messaged her a couple of times but I don’t want to push it. 

I’ve obviously come on too keen at some point and drove her away. How do you keep them interested without coming off as desperate in the talking stage?

We went to a restaurant that she never tried before but I have. We talked basically the whole time and it was really fun! When I got the check I then asked if she was doing anything afterwards she said no so I asked if she wanted to! She said yeah so we kind of just walked around the block and talked and I asked her if her hand was heavy during this. We then got in my car and drove around for a bit and ended up going to an arcade. At the end she got an Uber home and I asked her if she wanted me to wait with her for the Uber she said yeah. So I did when the Uber got there I looked at her she looked at me I started fumbling with words cuz I got butterflies more then any other point of the date and I feel like that was a moment we should of kissed but I didn’t go for it. 

I really want to see her again cuz I had a lot of fun! But I dont really know how to ask and I feel I ruined it cuz of the end there… probably overthinking things.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rsy79j/went_on_a_great_first_date_unsure_how_to_ask_for/

95,rsyg96,1640970625,2021 Recap,"What has dating in 2021 taught you? 

Now that the year is coming to an end, let’s do some reflecting. It was my (26F) first time actively dating this year and it has been an adventure to say the least 🤣. There were some highs and fun moments, and some heartbreaking ones, too, but I’m still excited about finding my person in the near future.

• I’ve learned that no response is a response (I got ghosted, and took it HARD.) going forward I know that I should leave the first time around instead of trying to get an answer from the other person.

• Dating should be fun! If you find yourself dreading it, I think taking a break is helpful to avoid dating fatigue. 

• I’ve also learned that OLD is not for me, so in 2022 I’m looking forward to getting out of my comfort zone and meeting new people in other ways :).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rsyg96/2021_recap/
96,rsyl9h,1640971010,First month of dating - Support,"Hello Reddit,

I recently broke up with a man (25M) that I dated for 5 weeks. In the end I decided that he wasn’t quite the right fit for me, even though I caught feelings. During the breakup I explained briefly why I was ending it while still respecting him. He was calm and understanding. 

He sent me a text last night, 3 days post breakup, asking for sex. I explained that I didn’t want to as I value sex more than that and it led into a conversation where he was degrading my decision to end the relationship. He blamed me for not having the patience to wait for him to basically get his life together and that I was missing out. I was kind in my texts and even assured him that there are better people out there suited for us. 

In my opinion, the first month of a relationship is typically to get to know someone and properly decide if you want to keep pursuing them or not. In his eyes, we were very committed and since I caught feelings that should be enough to fall in love and stay together. My opinions were all bashed and thrown out the window. He was basically laughing in my face.

You’d think that they would be more understanding and it would end of a civil note. Am I right for thinking that first month or so is for doing that - getting to know someone? Asking for a friend.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rsyl9h/first_month_of_dating_support/
