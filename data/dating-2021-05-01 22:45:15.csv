3,n2yipl,1619927636,I messed up with an online date and I feel like an idiot (F28),"have been single for 3 years almost (F28), and in the past year and a half I have tried online dating, and haven't really had much success. I have gone on about 5 dates, and most of them just didn't connect or they were just wanting to sleep with me.

I started talking to this man about a year and a half ago, but it wasn't super often, as he was working a lot and I was having some self-esteem issues. He seemed pretty interested in me the first few months and would message me regularly. We had a really good connection, and I enjoyed talking to him. I ended up telling him that I was having some mental health issues (mostly due to the election and pandemic) and I wasn't ready to date. He said he understood and that if I needed someone to talk to that I could reach out.  

We didn't talk for about 5 months after this. I messaged him about 2 weeks ago, and we seemed to get along at first and I was making flirty jokes and trying to see where he was at about that. I told him I didn't want to meet up until I got a vaccine, and it seemed like he was ok with that. He was asking about some of my mental health issues, and other things.. I would send long messages about it because I wanted to be honest, and I would try and ask him questions in return but he never would really answer them. Ever since then, he has really seemed distant, and we haven't talked in a few days. I know this sounds silly considering we haven't even met, but out of everyone I've talked to, he is the only one I could maybe see anything with. I have tried talking to probably 20+ guys and never really had any sort of connection recently. I am so embarrassed and I normally don't think I would have acted this way. The pandemic has really messed up mental health, and I don't even know how to hold a normal conversation anymore without oversharing or not sharing enough. Do you think this connection is ruined, if not how could I fix this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n2yipl/i_messed_up_with_an_online_date_and_i_feel_like/

6,n2ykdr,1619927827,Women should approach men more!,"On one hand, I can understand women wanting their man to be confident, and approach them.

However, I see many women talking about not being able to find a good man to love. 

If you are a woman, and you see a man that you wish would approach you, approach him.

Don't approach romantically, but friendly. Just ask a simple trivial question about him. 

If this man is single, and finds you attractive, he will naturally find a way to see you again.


Even as a man of confidence in talking to women, I still don't approach women unless I see a good reason to in that moment. Even if they take my breath away, a lot of the time I won't because of social normalities.

I know a lot of good men who approach women even less than I do (by a lot).

You ladies could be missing some decent (healthy and educated) men who just don't want to scare you, but are still confident in other aspects.

It is something I also noticed in my landlord today.

They both happen to be older white men.

Today, for the first time I think EVER, I told my partner ""you make dinner tonight."" I always, always make dinner. So, surprisingly, he started to cook. He had to run to the store to grab something, so he asked me to keep an eye on the potatoes in the oven.

I walk into the kitchen and see a pile of pepper on the counter.

Me- ""what's this?"" (Pointing at mess on counter)
Him- ""it's pepper""
Me- ""yea I see that. Why is it all over the counter?""
Him- ""I was cooking""

Dinner went great and he paid (I offered to pay for myself, because I‚Äôm not in it for free dinners or anything) he told me it was fine and he‚Äôll get it. 

Then we walked around the local park and then we drove to the beach (because it was like 5 mins away)

Anyway, I've never lived in a big city before so I don't know. What factors come to play, any advice or experience to have bigger chances to meet more single girls ? Does it depend on what city, exactly where in city..? Maybe the city life attracts the people who also want to date?

5‚Äô6‚Äù (5‚Äô8‚Äù with kicks lmao)

I feel like dating isn‚Äôt supposed to be this fucking hard but I have nothing else to compare it to since I‚Äôm not white, or tall, or both. I only have my own lived experience to compare it too.

Indian men are reported to have the lowest match rate on dating apps along with black women. On top of that, we all know the stories of short men being written off on the basis of their height. This is because of our genetics. Idk what the fuck I‚Äôm actually supposed to do in this situation.

I need more practice talking with women but according to reddit there‚Äôs never a fucking perfect time to talk to them. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt approach them at work, on the job, while their shopping, with their friends, join a club to meet new people but don‚Äôt join a club just to meet people‚Äù wtf am I supposed to do with this schizophrenic advice? I need experience but experience comes from exposure and that means I need opportunities. Being short and non white makes it so I have less opportunities to practice.

As a shorter guy you have to compensate. It‚Äôs the only way. Have to make up the deficit. But even then there‚Äôs a struggle. If you don‚Äôt try to overcompensate to overcome the racial and height barriers you‚Äôll be ignored, but if you do try and they recognize that your doing it, they‚Äôll say you‚Äôre less attractive for ‚Äútrying to hard‚Äù.

Not only do I have to show them ‚Äòoh I‚Äôm not like those OTHER short guys‚Äô but I ALSO have to demonstrate ‚Äòoh I‚Äôm not like those OTHER creepy Indian dudes‚Äô. This is more than a hill it feels like a fucking mountain.

‚ÄúBut think about from the women‚Äôs perspective yet hey get hundreds of matches‚Äù

I understand and try to empathize but at the same time, indiscriminately swiping right on literally hundreds of girls only to get like 3-5 matches, all of whom will ghost you at some point fucking sucks. 

I need more practice talking to women romantically, I‚Äôm fine in non romantic settings. But ffs how can I get that fucking experience if I‚Äôm literally radioactive. I feel like I can‚Äôt message a girl too much either otherwise I get hit with the ‚Äúcreepy Indian guy in the DMs‚Äù, another fun story they can laugh about with their friends and say ‚Äòoh yeah that happened to me too lmao‚Äô. Do you know how much this fucking sucks? 

Please don‚Äôt give anecdotal evidence ‚Äúoh I know a guy, I heard about this one guy, not me but‚Äù please it literally doesn‚Äôt help. Because it comes off as delegitimizing.

I heard about a study which stated shorter men basically needed to massively out-earn their competition in order to date. Something like by 100K? I have to literally be in the one percent of earners? South Asian men are the highest earning minority group in the U.S. but it‚Äôs still easier said then done. It‚Äôs an arduous task in and of itself. Years of education and studying.

I‚Äôm tired. I hate having to put in so much effort in order to overcome being immediately written off. Running, lifting, studying, public speaking, comedy, fixing old acne scars caused by stress genetics and bullying etc. OLD is horrible for my self confidence and makes me feel unlovable. Like I did something wrong and can‚Äôt fix it.

I‚Äôve always wanted to go out on a date and stuff. It always seemed so fun. Idk what to do. I don‚Äôt feel like I can even talk about this stuff.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n31f1f/everyone_gets_rejected_but_some_face_more/

37,n31nj5,1619941789,Is it possible for both of us Dating with a mental illness like this?,"Hello, I'm new and English is not my First language ( keep in mind :3 )  


How hard is it to date someone with ***Borderline personality disorder*** ( BPD ) While yourself has  ***Antisocial personality disorder*** ( ASPD ) I try my best to let others know before they can judge me and OR so when they need to let me know I'm doing something wrong they would let me know  
\- Yes we are both diagnosed by psychologists -  


I have really bad trust issues and Pretty much an introvert while he ( or she :D ) has a hard case of BPD and he/she is pretty much a social butterfly. . .  
Yes, it's bad to think about (all men/women are x) but the anxiety is killing me only by thinking about it.  


I read/reached out/experimented ( don't worry the experiment was more like an Exel spreadsheet of its Emotional pattern and such ) and Did so much about how to care and support someone with BPD but it made me more anxious knowing about the possibilities and how we can both react to each other, I tried my best to take care of it but at the same time I'm scared, it hangs a lot with the opposite sex of it itself, That, it makes me want to go and see what is going on if I'm not there, Especially reading about how the possibilities are higher for someone with BPD to cheat BUT then again ( Not all X's are Y's ) And to think that we both go to different college and different workplaces it makes me feel rotten.  


Some said that it is better to just end it and go our own paths, but we really like each other ( and by we ""I"" really like it more ) - I don't want this to end like that -

42,n327rc,1619944470,Unsure how I (26F) should proceed with this person and how he (35M) feels. Advice?,"Had been talking to this guy for a few months prior to the meeting. He said he is open to a relationship but not with anyone (same). I ended up thinking that he was a bit too forward in the kindest way and I had gotten out of a relationship a month or so beforehand. We had some really great chats. I think he took it a bit negatively and blocked me on social media. I had noticed that he unblocked me on social media so I reached out saying it was probably a miscommunication. He responded positively and we had our first date. Said to me to come to his which we did, we ordered food to his (very gentlemanly sort of guy), attracted to each other, great chats again and we went on a little evening picnic. We both have similar interests in academic stuff. We only kissed that night. I got to his around 6 pm and left almost 12 hours later. He offered that I could stay the night but we could sleep in separate rooms or he was happy to drive me home but it was late, so he ordered an uber for me. We both are quite busy and we had our second date a few weeks later. He said it would be nice to hang again. A few days before our second date, he asked what I was up to one evening and offered movie night in PJs.  


Anyway, the second date comes, I got to know him a bit better and he mentioned that we're quite similar. Joked that we both mumble a lot. Ended up sleeping together, not a selfish person, cuddled afterwards and had our good chats. The date went really long like last time and I got an uber home. He messaged me asking if I was okay and to send me the details of the driver. We have been in contact via social media a bit since.  


I'm just unsure whether he should be the one that expresses what he wants in person or do I mention that this is what I'm after. He works till the evenings throughout the week and weekend so it seems that I can only see him after work hours.  
He reached out asking how I am, days went by and I started to think that I didn't like it how I wouldn't know when I was going to see this guy again and that if it's not meant to be, it's all good. Immature but I sent him a text saying that I didn't like it how our two dates consisted at just his house and that I'm often left not knowing when I would see him again, I said I don't have expectations around texting.  


He said he would talk to me the next day as he had a lot on his plate and he is sorry for not mentioning when he would like to see me again in the manner it deserves. I knew the answer wouldn't be good so I deleted him off my social media. He sent me a very rude message the next day saying I was immature, we ended up calling and he said that he thought he would be open to a relationship but he thinks he cannot provide what I would like. I then said to him that I've only met him twice and I'm unsure myself but I do like to know when I'm with someone if they would like to see me again such as 'this was great, when are you free next?' and weirdly he said he felt the same with me. He also said something along the lines of that he doesn't hear from me for days and is unsure of how I feel. He said forget the relationship talk, that he likes me and thinks I'm cool but he asked what my expectations were regarding texting and said he would like to see me again. He said we don't also have to be sexual when we catch up, we can be friends or anything.  


The next day I said I would like to see him again but I would not pressure him but I understand if he doesn't as I don't want to waste my time. I apologised for blocking him. He rudely responded and said ""I don't want to deal with this f\*\*king bullshit right now, **name**. I said I've been accommodating enough and to not contact me again. He replied saying 'f**\*** off, mate' and blocked my number and on WhatsApp. I noticed this morning he unblocked me.  


**TL;DR** guy that I would have liked to have seen again has proved to be quite unstable. Unsure whether I've done the right thing but not ever going to talk to him again. We unfortunately are very similar and have similar interests. I've noticed that he's been blocking a lot of people on his Instagram.

*Currently not studying because I didnt get accepted into the art college I wanted to study at and not working but still looking*

Ever since I moved I now go to this tabacco shop thats super close to my house...like a 45 second walk, to either get snacks for when I have the munchies or anything caffeine related like a rockstar energy.

Every now and again when I visit...I see this cute girl that looks around my age working at the till, I dont see her every time I go to get stuff but when I do shes the one that rings me up for my things. 

Shes about my heigh but slightly shorter, (I'm 5,7 so perhaps shes 5,5 or maybe 5,6) long brown hair, and always has a very adorable black dress on or a black top.

I dont know how to describe it perfectly but I feel like perhaps theres a spark?...maybe...?

She would touch my hand while grabbing the can of monster or rockstar energy drink to ring up...smile very nicely...complement my hoodie that I wear and say ""have a nice smoke session"" ...very kind of her. She most definitely smelled the weed off of me while I was infront of her haha.

I'd say thank you and say I like her cute top or complement her pretty dress (but I'll be honest..without looking at her directly because of my shyness)...then I'd say thank you and bye...then be on my way.

I would like to ask her out but I dont really have the confidence to do it...plus the language might get in the way...you see I live in Spain and have done for about 16 years now I can speak Spanish ""fine"" and read it perfectly but my confidence and ""mental hangups"" do hold me back and I'm shy like I just mentioned....so I decided to ask reddit and see what are my options. And or what's the best route of asking her out. 

And what's the best advice, plus I wanna hear what everyone else thinks because I'm honestly curious. 

(Btw any questions relating to this post, or me or the girl herself, please ask away and I'll give my best and honest answer) * I promise*


This is what I had in mind on how to do it:

I was thinking on drawing her a picture because I'm a artists and I like to draw alot, lots of creepy art and very dark style and dark sense of humour.
I'll write a little note aswell saying something like...

""hello, I see you every now and again behind the counter you look and seem very interesting, *(insert my instagram name here)* maybe perhaps we could have a chat on Instagram and grap a cup of coffe together? Your under no obligation nor presure to answer. Message me if it's all good. Have a lovely day!

I'd give her the drawing and note in a small red envelope then immediately go home and hope for a reply from her.


Is this a good idea? What other way could I achive this?


Thank you for reading my post! Have a good day!

Will update everyone when I decide to go through with the plan or a plan

53,n33i2f,1619950845,Online dating isn't a job application..,"I used to have dating profile that allows you to select what you're looking for and to write a bit about you. It wasn't too full on, this app. I tended to get loads of messages  and asked out -over 3K. Take those numbers with a pinch of salt. I'm really particular in what I want, It was hard finding a guy that was my type so I couldn't agree to date anyone except 1 guy who was my type. 

If you genuinely want something serious then unconditional traits and chat is really important. 
I think people forget to establish what each other wants..is it a.. hook up, serious relationship, fun... What is it because it makes no sense entertaining men that just want fun when you want a serious relationship!! 

Profiles-
You get people who write the bare minimum and people who write paragraphs. 

Huge paragraphs leaves nothing to the imagination. It tells me you're well written. Do I really value someone as eloquent? Possibly not.. You're a good human, but do I want to date you?  Probably not..
If someone being well written is your thing then go for it. The way you write as well, can make it seem like you're friendzoning yourself. The way you write doesn't do it for me, I don't want to feel like I'm messaging a lecturer. 

Unconditional traits:
I think everyone has a type, things they definitely want and things they don't. No matter how superficial it is, if you can't see yourself looking past it then you should keep it as a filter so you don't waste your time with people you definitely aren't going to pursue. 

I personally believe you should get the unconditional out the way no matter what it is, so if it's religion, or any other things. If you ain't seen the persons picture possibly a feature you don't like physically. Height ...weight ..anything.. that's the only way to sieve through what you want and don't want.

So I'm the type of person who tends to know what I want, physically and. I also know what personality I want from a guy. 

I usually determine the personality based of a vibe and reverse psychology so I can get a feel of his character. 

Chatting-  
Be subtle when you're trying to figure out someone is your type. Be quick to determine the unconditional so you don't string or lead them on

Some people prefer to be friends and be really goofy initially, some people not. I rather have a spark or a build up to a spark . Usually I do this by conversing and judging you in my mind. I personally can't be attracted to someone I'm goofy around, I need to love you before I do that..

I also look at the way they talk and react to things that give me an idea of what they're like in person. 

Online dating is casual-
There is no need to go into depth on your profile. If someone really wants to get to know you based on your profile and pic then they will. 

The conversation should just flow. I can't stand being in an interview. 

How we chat to each other can be a deterrent.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n33i2f/online_dating_isnt_a_job_application/
54,n345hz,1619953697,Love hurts,"So I had a crush on this girl a few years back. She ghosted me after our first hang. Hurt a bit at the time and for some reason left me with the question of what if and all these lingering feelings toward her. 

Ran into her again earlier this year where we chatted and I asked her out again. I know, it was not the greatest idea, but I guess a part of me needed to know if she truly wasn‚Äôt interested in me or there was some other reason that she ghosted me for. 
She actually said yes when I asked her out. But then reneged later in the week. Lol I know, clear and obvious signs that she isn‚Äôt interested but this crush I have on her blinded me and I agreed to hang out with her later on. 
The first time we hung out, I felt that energy and feelings of enjoyment (crushing hard!!?!?!?) and she gave me a kiss on the cheek when we said goodbye and mannnnnnnnnn.... the next few days I could not stop thinking about her. 
Next hang was good. Delved into more emotional and personal layers, getting to know the deeper part of her and that‚Äôs when I told myself that I‚Äôm really start to like her. 

So, I told her that I have a crush on her. 
I figured it‚Äôs probably a little obvious but I needed to know where I stood. 
She said she‚Äôs sussing it out and interested but yeah.
Flat and dry response I guess. 
Just enough of a thread to hold onto, but I think deep down I knew, she wasn‚Äôt into me like I was into her. 

Anyway she was keen to hang again and I figured this is final d day. If she is weird and awkward or if she is cold and distant, I‚Äôll know for sure. 

Saw her again today!!! Good and fun time but again nothing to go off. Several times where I wanted to kiss her, but I didn‚Äôt want to force anything and make her feel uncomfortable I guess. Maybe I was too timid but I wanted to give her the right space and not force anything. 

Right before the day ended, I asked her if I could kiss her and she declined. :(
I did also let her know that whilst I like talking to her and hanging out, I am not just interested in being friends as I definitely do feel some type of way about her and if she doesn‚Äôt feel the same way, that‚Äôs totally okay but I guess I need to know. 
She said she wanted some time to process but she gave me a call on my drive home and let me know that she doesn‚Äôt feel the same way.


So as I lay here in bed, I feel sad that it didn‚Äôt work out and that she doesn‚Äôt feel the same way. I do feel proud that I was open and honest but that doesn‚Äôt bring me much comfort at the moment.

4. You don't care about money too much.
5. You don't lose interest fast and know how to forgive.

66,n35vfi,1619960191,How do you get over the guilt of letting yourself be emotionally manipulated?,"**TLDR in bold,** *venting in italics*

My (25m) partner (25f) and I dated from October of last year. At first, everything was great- we saw each other every week, we talked all the time, shared the same life passions/humor, and so on- it felt like for the first time, I really clicked with someone. I'm a second-year med student and she's a PA student, so we didn't have a ton of free time, but it seemed like we enjoyed the time we shared together. We are in a lot of similar circles (mentors and whatnot). We were also able to share war stories and our traumas. She was the first person I ever said I love you to, and she told that to me as well- I let myself imagine a future with her. 

*She has a lot (and I mean a LOT) of trauma, but for the next 5 months, I was supportive, caring, and the perfect boyfriend- I did everything possible to make sure she felt comfortable, and she appreciated it and let me know. I helped her through her insecurities about our relationship, about being cheated on in past relationships, and put up with her flakiness and refusal to make plans in advance because she was really busy. I even made special curry powders from scratch so she could share in my people's food... but she's never tried them.*

*In March, we had an incident where I made a mistake (see prior posts for context), and spiraled a bit. Since then, she's treated me like absolute shit. Saying it was ""a good thing"" when I spiraled so I might have an idea of how she felt, saying she needed time to work through things but that she still wanted me, but also calling me when she needed emotional support. Saying things like ""think of someone other than yourself"" when I talked to her about how I was feeling, attacking me and devaluing me as a person because I told her that talking through conflict with a partner helps both people move forward. Lashing out at me when I suggested that she should discuss what happened with her therapist (not a boundary in our relationship to that point)*

*Dropping the silent treatment on me, then eventually explaining that it was her plan with her therapist so I could focus on studying... but she never told me that. She's lashed out at me when she was upset. Obviously that makes me feel shitty, and she didn't respond when I called her out on it in a text (I think I said ""I'm your boyfriend, not your therapist,"" and she never responded). At this point, we haven't talked in almost 6 weeks, but we still haven't had a proper conversation about breaking up (which I think might be inevitable at this point), and I'm not sure where we stand. I'm also in my dedicated period to study for the board exams (a huge deal), and I'm just a giant ball of anxiety. I don't want to break up now, because I think it'll just stress me out more.*

**It kind of sucks that after I made one mistake, I was dead to her. She repeatedly emphasized the importance of communication in a relationship, but has essentially refused to communicate AT ALL... while at times saying that she wants to talk more, and will talk to me after boards. It is incredibly frustrating.** 

**I'm also starting to realize (thanks, therapy) that she's been manipulating me throughout our relationship- in many, many ways, and that I looked past a TON of red flags without realizing it. She's said things like ""I'm a bad partner"" when she's flaked on plans (and I reassured her she wasn't), or made me think we had plans and later told me that they never existed, or made a big deal about Christmas or birthday gifts she never tried to give me.** **She's been gaslighting me constantly and I'm just now realizing it.**

**Objectively, I know that its not my fault that I was taken advantage of, but right now... I feel guilty and kind of blame myself for falling into this trap. I feel guilty that I have let myself feel pain that wasn't mine to bear, and that I let myself be walked over and didn't advocate for myself strongly enough early in the relationship. How do I get through those feelings of guilt? I'm trying to be kind to myself and mentally move on, but I feel hurt and really shitty. I know I'll advocate for myself more in future relationships, but other than that and focusing on the boards... what do I do?**

I spent a lot ( A LOT ) of time questioning whether I was just a lesbian who felt the need to mask my queerness with a bisexual shield. I'm very straight passing and so it's easy for me to fly under the radar. However, I came to the conclusion that though there isn't a label that best describes my attraction towards people (bisexual is too limiting, pan just doesn't feel right for me, these are all my own opinions on labeling myself not the labels themselves) I still know I'm attracted to multiple genders - including cisgender, heterosexual men. I haven't dated or been with a man since I came out, and to be honest the thought of it kind of scares me. I had a lot of negative experiences with guys when I was a teenager pushing my boundaries, verbally abusing me, taking advantage of me physically. I also just dated a lot of immature, emotionally unavailable guys as well. I think a part of me is convinced that if I try dating guys now, I will always have those same experiences even as a grown woman. My point is that I know I'm still attracted to men, and I would like to eventually give it a go with dating them as a mature adult but my mind is convinced all guys will be like my high school boyfriends.

We spent 7 hours together on the third date and I had a good time. He's a really cool and interesting person BUT he didn't make a move at all!!

I thought i was giving signs by making eye contact, getting closer to him etc. but I don't know if I wasn't being clear enough or he's just shy.

I think he realised he's going too slow as he just invited me to go to his place next week. He plans on cooking me something and then watching a movie after. It's such a sweet idea but I've already lost romantic feelings for him and I realised we would be better off as friends as I can't see any 'spark' between us.

79,n37xow,1619967146,Tired and confused. Not sure if I did the right thing.,"I‚Äôm 23F. I have been single for 5 years already. I started going on dating apps like Bumble and Tinder to explore and go back to the dating scene.

Then a month ago, I matched with some guys including this one (24M) on Bumble. So this guy, amongst all my other matches, he‚Äôs the one that really vibes with me. We have the same interests and values and I really enjoy talking to him. I‚Äôve been in this app since last year and this is the first guy I genuinely clicked with.

I am just TIRED of the cycle of failed interactions I have on dating apps so I decided to cut off communication with my other matches and stick to this one (also because I am quite busy and cannot concentrate on talking to so many guys lol). However, I am not sure if he is into me the way I am into him.

We haven‚Äôt met in person as we have just started talking recently and the pandemic situation in my country isn‚Äôt getting any better so our only form of communication is through chat. He takes so much time to reply to my messages (like 3-8 hours). We also do not do the usual greetings coz he really takes so much time to reply that I end up falling asleep and replying the next day lol. He says he is busy which is understandable as we are both working professional. But it‚Äôs getting dragging for me coz we haven‚Äôt even cracked on some personal stuff or got to know our personalities. Except for one time that he casually brought up about his ‚Äòex‚Äô who used to study in the same university as mine. And this ‚Äòex‚Äô was a guy.

Yeah, so I figured he might be bisexual. I don‚Äôt wanna pry on him so I haven‚Äôt really asked him about it coz I want it to come from him. I want him to initiate the convo when he is comfortable. Anyway, it‚Äôs fine by me and I never really have any issues if he‚Äôs bi and this is beside the point actually, but yeah this is like the only ‚Äòpersonal‚Äô thing we have only talked about for weeks now. The other topics are just very casual talking about how‚Äôs our days etc. I feel like I‚Äôm inside a supeeeeeeeer slow burn fiction with the way this ‚Äúdating‚Äù is progressing.

To be fair, he is still replying to my messages and he doesn‚Äôt seem to lose interest but I get anxious that maybe I am just assuming things and he really is not into me at all. I am not sure if I did the right thing which is focusing on this guy and cutting off my other matches. But like, again I‚Äôm tired of seeking other guys anymore and I just can‚Äôt bring myself up to interact with them again. I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm also confused with myself and maybe insecure coz I just don‚Äôt want to end up getting my heart broken after being single for so long.

A year - year and a half ago this guy I really liked asked me out. We went on a handful of dates and it seemed to be going well, until the covid lockdown started. Then almost right away, he started ignoring me. I should‚Äôve left him right then and there but because I didn‚Äôt really know what was going on and because I was inexperienced (he was my 1st) I kept hanging on to hope.

He broke up with me a couple months after that, and one of the things he told me was he didn‚Äôt feel for me as much as he‚Äôd felt for his ex. He told me that he‚Äôd been extremely physically / sexually attracted to his ex and not really that much with me. 

That really stuck with me. It‚Äôs been a while, and I got over him a long time ago, but I feel a lot less desirable and a lot more insecure now. What he said about his ex being more attractive still pops up in my head quite often and I feel jealous looking at other couples. I feel so petty admitting that, but it‚Äôs true. I tell myself I don‚Äôt deserve that because no one will ever be attracted to me physically. I‚Äôve also started to belittle myself for not having a BF / being a virgin at my age.

84,n38cn3,1619968374,Found a list of female names including mine on the home desk of a guy I‚Äôm dating,"I (31F) am currently multidating, but have been out 4 times with one guy (36M) and we get along well. We‚Äôve slept together at this point, and it‚Äôs very good. We‚Äôve discussed kids, marriage, culture, religion, our parents‚Äô feelings about interreligious/intercultural/interracial relationships ...Overall he is a really great candidate‚ÄîI‚Äôm allowing things to slowly develop and I‚Äôm comfortable with my own feelings for him at this point (I can be anxious and/or sometimes get too excited) and happy to see where it goes. However, last time I saw him, I found a list on his desk (I wasn‚Äôt snooping... My name caught my eye) and I found a few groups of female first names written on a paper, including my own. One of the names was underlined, one of them had a dot by it, one had a big X by it, and mine had two dots by it. No clue what this means and won‚Äôt try to guess... but it‚Äôs kinda on my mind now because we aren‚Äôt hanging out on primetime nights and it makes me wonder if he knows he likes one of the others, but is continuing to see me until they DTR because more sex&gt;less sex. Now obviously as I said, I realize we are BOTH multidating and he hasn‚Äôt seen my list... and what I‚Äôm feeling is not jealousy. It‚Äôs simply... wanting to know where I stand. And I guess I would need to do the same in return. And truthfully I‚Äôm not ready to DTR, and do not expect he is either. My concern chiefly centers around the markings next to the names and a possible ranking situation. And I‚Äôm not dating for FWB.

Should I ask him about it? If he knows he is going a different direction, I assume I will eventually hear. But I wonder if I should investigate further to see if I should just cut my losses and place my attentions elsewhere.

In my longest relationship of 4 years, I fell out of love over time. The hardest part for me was that I still loved her but I was no longer in love with her anymore, so it wasn't easy (she's the only woman I can say Ive ever been in love with). As I've gotten older it seems like I don't make it past about a month or two before I call it quits and want to be alone again. Maybe it's just a case of not meeting the right woman yet or wanting to guard myself, but I feel like the longer I go on, the more difficult it is getting. The messed up part about it all is that I'm lonely, but then I also seem to prefer being alone.... its a weird dichotomy.

We‚Äôve been talking a few months, but only started hanging out pretty recently (thanks, virus-that-shall-not-be-named!). I like him a lot, and I‚Äôm pretty confident things are going well. I‚Äôve only dated one person before, who was a bit of a hermit with only one (also male) friend.

Okay. So the guy I‚Äôm seeing has a fair few close female friends. Guy friends, too, but that‚Äôs not super relevant here. And (sue me, yes I had a Facebook stalk) these girls are so . . conventionally attractive? Like genuinely super pretty, seem super nice, in a way that I know I‚Äôm just *not*. I‚Äôve always been painfully insecure, and whilst I‚Äôm getting slowly better with it, I can‚Äôt help but feel anxious whenever he talks about his friends, or how great they are, or the banter they have. I also know that most of his female friends had a stalk of me on Facebook once he told them about me, which makes me more than a little self conscious 

I suppose I should emphasise here that I *know* that this is a me problem: I don‚Äôt expect him to change, or stop talking to anyone, or anything like that. I know, logically, that I wouldn‚Äôt even be in the picture if he was interested in dating any of them. This is fully my own insecurity messing with me.

98,n39oww,1619971977,Guy I‚Äôm dating doesn‚Äôt wear mask around his friends. How do I confront him if he thinks media blows Covid out of proportion?,"Guy I‚Äôm seeing doesn‚Äôt social distance. I am starting to develop feelings for him but I don‚Äôt know if I should date him or not. Advice is so appreciated. Please read the whole post. Thanks!

So I‚Äôve been seeing a guy I met online for a week now. He‚Äôs really kind and we get on well on multiple fronts. It‚Äôs honestly been really hard finding someone who shares my values and beliefs and wants a lot of the same things I want. However, when it comes to Covid he isn‚Äôt careful. He doesn‚Äôt wear his mask around most of his friends. He says that he is mindful of who he‚Äôs hanging out with based on their ages and that he will wear a mask if he‚Äôs around older people. However he has a vibrant social life in person and this really concerns me. I explained to him that my dad is getting cancer treatments and that I want him to get vaccinated if he decides he wants to keep dating me. At first he said he would and now he says he‚Äôs open but he‚Äôs wary of the negative effects of the vaccine. He told me yesterday that he doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very likely he‚Äôll catch the virus so he‚Äôs not worried about himself. He thinks that mainstream media blows the virus out of proportion. Regarding Covid he is clearly very ignorant. 

I told him that he should get vaccinated to protect himself at the very least since I am developing feelings for him don‚Äôt want to lose him to Covid. He said that he‚Äôll look into it but that he doesn‚Äôt think getting vaccinated will stop the spread of the virus and he‚Äôs not worried about himself getting Covid. Even if getting vaccinated doesn‚Äôt stop the spread of Covid, What I don‚Äôt think he realizes is how you can be a carrier of Covid without symptoms. I feel too frustrated and tired to explain all the basics to him that I‚Äôve been keeping up with all year (cause I pay attention) and I wonder how he could be so ignorant about the risks of Covid. I told him that I value keeping others safe and said that he should too. He understands my viewpoint but seems to want to look at both sides (and is veering towards not taking Covid safety that seriously as a result). 

What gets me is that he isn‚Äôt always wearing a mask around people to completely minimize spreading the virus. How do I convince him to value safety more if it‚Äôs already been over a year of the pandemic and he isn‚Äôt being careful? I told him that love looks like sacrifice and that you can be creative in how you get your social needs met without putting others at risk. He said that mental health matters more than getting Covid and that love should require some risk as well. Although he agrees with me about the importance of being careful it still appears he doesn‚Äôt care much to protect others. 

He told me on our last date that he thinks my ask for him to get vaccinated is oddly specific and feels a bit demanding but he understands my situation with my dad having cancer. But he fears I‚Äôll be demanding about other things down the line. He wanted me to understand that getting vaccinated is a personal choice as an American and I told him that while I wouldn‚Äôt push that on friends, it‚Äôs different in a dating context. I said that he doesn‚Äôt have to date me but that that‚Äôs where I stand on the issue and that I need a partner who values accommodating me to help me feel safe. He said he‚Äôll look into getting the vaccine but can‚Äôt promise me he will get it.

I like him for other reasons than his ignorant viewpoint on Covid. I don‚Äôt know how to keep discussing my frustration and fear over his lack of safety. I fear that if I am too harsh with him that it will kill the delicate connection that‚Äôs budding between us. I also fear that if I ask him to wear a mask around all his friends he won‚Äôt do it because he‚Äôll think I‚Äôm being too demanding and intrusive of his ‚ÄúAmerican freedom.‚Äù Maybe I‚Äôm just desperate for a relationship but I actually think he‚Äôs worth it to get to know given all the other things we have in common.  However, I can see that he‚Äôs stubborn and kind of a devils advocate but has a lot of ignorance too as well as uninformed opinions. What do you recommend I do to communicate my concerns with him at this early of a stage in our relationship? I hate confrontation and have a lot of emotions attached to this whole issue with Covid.
