* When selecting pictures of yourself, have at least 50% that do not have a filter on them.

Contrary to popular belief, a lot of men. Don’t just swipe indiscriminately. We look through all your pictures, and to a decent amount of us, not being able to see what you look like without a filter puts us off. I’m having a filter in some of them isn’t a big deal, however using a filter in 5 out of 7 of the pictures just doesn’t look good.

* On the topic of pictures, have 2 that we can see your body.

Guys want to know what we’re getting in to. If you only have picture of yourself from the neck up, we don’t know. To me at least, if you don’t show your body, it shows that you’re hiding something or are a catfish, for all I know, you have 3 legs, webbed feet, and a tail.

* In pictures, make sure we can easily tell who you are.

Having a picture to show you have friends is great, but don’t make all your pictures group pictures without any indication of who you are.

* HAVE A GOOD BIO

With the amount of women that talk about how men don’t have bios, some ladies are awful at bios. Bios in women are especially important because if you want a guy to give you a genuine opener that he doesn’t send to every other girl, we need to know something about you. Let us know a little about you so we’re don’t have to resort to crappy pick up lines and “heyyy’s”.

* If you have dealbreakers list them.

This is going to be controversial. So I’m 5’10, I know that to 70% of women I’ll be too short. I’d much rather see that some girl wants a 6’+ guy on her profile and swipe left then have her stop responding after she asks my height. This applies to other dealbreakers. List them. Women and insecure men for some reason care when someone had their dealbreakers on their profile, honestly it just makes it easier for everyone.

* The final tip I have is to diversify your pictures.

This is pretty simple, use different poses a different face look. It just kinda puts me off when every girls picture is some pose with the same smile.

Hope this was helpful, I didn’t mean any offense to anyone.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,797480,public,self,"Since I always see the reverse, here’s some tips for ladies on making a dating app profile from a guy.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nlisbg/since_i_always_see_the_reverse_heres_some_tips/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

One side effect (or benefit) of being intentionally celibate and single for this long is that I really got to know myself. I love being by myself now and for the first time in my life I enjoy being single! I've also heard that I give off a more confident, positive and relaxed vibe now which seems to be attracting men into my life. (I used to be always looking for someone, even when I didn't realize it, and maybe had a bit of a desperate vibe, lol) but now when I meet a man I think about what we both could contribute to each others lives if sex wasnt a thing. (Because what I see is that people stop having sex eventually? So I don't want to make it the foundation of the relationship.)

So anyway during this time of working on myself, I started studying my dating history and experiences and realized that they were all bad. (My lack of knowledge of self played a big role in this.) Talking to my single and married friends (men and women) who all seem to be unhappy with the relationships they're in or have been in, has made me affraid of getting back into dating. Also the more I talk to people or read dating posts on reddit the more horror stories I'm hearing about ""what's out there"". I've met a lot of men during this time and have rejected them all due to this fear.

I don't want to go back into toxic dating, but I also dont know if I could be celibate forever. I had originally planned on being celibate for just a year. Any advice from anyone who might be going through this type of resistance to dating?

The craziest part is that we started our relationship without having a clear idea about when we will meet next. 

We come from two different cities of a fairly large country (2000+ km apart) and met while we were interning at the same organization abroad. While being there, we got to spend some time together and something clicked (we had gotten to know each other over text a couple of months before). It was in our last two weeks when we had “the conversation” about being in a long-distance relationship. I was immature and unaware about the reality of being in such a relationship and somehow convinced him to get into this mess as I couldn’t imagine letting him go. 

After going back it was much harder than we expected it to be. We hadn't planned this before but we ended up spending significant parts of our day getting involved in each other's lives by texting/talking/watching movies together; this backfired later. Also, I used to remain occupied for a good number of hours in the day due to some obligatory work unlike him. All this affected him negatively so much more than it did to me. 

We met for the first time after the internship around 5 months later; after which covid destroyed all our meeting plans. Moving-in together wasn’t an option as well. After graduation (1.5 years of our relationship) we landed up in different cities 600 km apart for graduate school. We are trying hard to spend at least a week together once every 1.5-2 months but even that hasn't helped us settle emotionally and it has been especially difficult to address the host of differences/hurts that we had accumulated in the past. I also fear that this regular-ish meeting won’t be sustainable after the online class period ends, which could be in the next 4-5 months. The earliest we can even have an option (best case scenario) to stay in nearby cities/ move together is not before 2 years.

We cannot give up on this relationship as it's very hard justifying leaving while we're still in love. And with so much time together it's also obviously not a trivial thing to do. On the other hand, I am unable to gather hope of a stable future (which is personally very important for me) considering the struggles we have had in the past while it is really difficult for him to think of a future without ever really having a present (he loves me a lot).

What should we do to keep this relationship afloat? Or if you think parting ways is the only solution now, how do we do that?

I've been meeting a girl for some time and last time I asked her for a date.

We met and 'talked'. We went directly to it and she stated that she tried to picture me as a bf, but couldn't. I didn't take that personally and offered her to be friends.

After that we went to her place, watched Mr. Nobody (great film btw) and after we escaped the deeptalk state the movie left us with, we played a bit in bed (no kissing or whatever, just like taking pics and just fooling around. Not doing anything explicit or sexual.) She then rested her head on my shoulder and we both laid in bed, it felt really nice and I felt very close to her, after that it was pretty late and it was time for me to go back home. When I said goodbye I hugged her and I didn't kiss her on the head like last time (bc I don't want to be pushy or appear indifferent to her statements). Overall I can say tho, that I freaking love this girl so much and I hope we can ""evolve"" in the future, if we give it enough time.

I thought of moving our relationship to the next step(asked her for a crop top pic or pic that showed tummy area) but that backfired on me as she was hurt and broke up with me, she left me only one option of messaging her, blocking me from everything. I tried to convince her but of no use as she said we had no future together. Angry as I was at her for not forgiving me ( this is the 1st time I messed up badly) I thought things will get better. She still cared for me but sometimes send me rude, hurtful messages like forget me, u broke my trust etc. So I waited for another couple of weeks while we both asked for each other's health and she said the hurt will get better and everything will be fine after some days u will heal and that we can't be together. More than 20 days passed since the incident but there was little progress in getting back. So I got angry too much, thinking how much I should wait and she was treating me badly but in fact, she was caring a bit and needed some more time. I send her a rude ,bad and angry msg, then she replied with a horrible angry msg and blocked me everywhere leaving me no method of contacting her. I felt horrible, guilty, bad, anxious and uneasy.

Fast forward to a week after that she sent me a msg saying sorry because of all the hurtful things she said in the msg .She told me to not reply to her msg, this was her last msg and she wont be looking forward to any msg from me and she wants to end things on good terms. Good Bye.

I don't know what to do, I feel so anxious and uneasy. Help a guy out, can I do anything to get her back?

We have been official since November, so around 7 months.

My boyfriend (29M) lives at home, so whenever I (24F) have been invited over it always has to be when his family is out of the house. According to him, his younger sister is aware of me and knows about our relationship. I always have to sneak around whenever I get to his place, and it admittedly makes my anxiety skyrocket! Whenever I have expressed my feelings about this, he appears guilty that this affects me emotionally, but states that he does not want to make things awkward if his parents were to know I was in his room...for I think obvious reasons-which I can understand because it would be the same situation for my own house.

I am also not oblivious to the fact that the fact that I'm white may cause some unwanted comments from his parents, which he says he wants to shied me from. Wanting to confirm this, I asked my guy friend (who is also Chinese), and he says this sort of behaviour is completely normal and that I shouldn't be worried. I just need advice regarding whether you think he is truly taking me seriously, or does it seem like it's not going anywhere?

He does not use social media at all, so I don't mind/find it makes sense that he never posts about me, and he always emphasizes that all of his friends know of me.

I highly recommend it for other men who haven't had much luck online, if they can handle it.

I've decided that lowering my standards, in order either to get some or to find a serious girlfriend, will ultimately leave me disappointed for two reasons:

* It will diminish or negate the confidence boost I might otherwise expect from finding someone
* It will place me with someone I find at least somewhat unattractive, and thus generate resentment

I've thus also decided that, in order to preserve what confidence I already have and build it into something greater, the way to go is against the most obvious path. I've decided to actually raise my standards. This will result in one of two outcomes:

* I find someone I really dig, am happier as a result, and get a confidence boost
* I don't find anyone, but get a confidence boost nonetheless knowing I didn't settle

Realistically speaking, I'm not a *terrible* candidate for a date. I have a car and a steady job, I speak multiple languages, I've been losing weight and building muscle, I'm getting my own place soon, and I'm actually somewhat attractive judging by the looks I get sometimes. I don't think I should have to date down, and not as drastically far down as the odds for online dating would suggest I go. In fact, I'd like to date up.

In relationships with ""mature"" men, it seems like the attraction comes from things like a man's ability to be dominant provider type, which is just something that doesn't mesh with me and therefore isn't attractive to me. When I hear about those weird relationships between older women in their late 20s or 30s and guys in their teens or early 20s, it feels really appealing to me and I wish I could be those guys. The idea of being desired for just being me and not having to wealthy or a leader or anything just feels ""right"" to me.

But now m I am feeling like I am getting too old to be able to play that role. At 33, a woman in her mid to late 30s or early 40s does not see me as a ""younger guy"" anymore. In fact, I even think that at a certain point even women 20 years older than you stop seeing you in that way. I am thinking I may even already be at that age, but because I look unusually young, I am not feeling the effects of it.

First post here.
I just needed to get this off my chest.

I (F23) got out of my last serious relationship of 4 years in 2019, so I've been single for roughly2 years now.

I tried casual hookups, I met a few guys irl, but nothing really seemed to work and I lost all my confidence.

Now I went back to looking for a date online with the help of an app.

I was devastated because I thought I met a decent dude, which turned out to be a huge fail bc I didn't see any red flags. Whelp. After a month i recovered and switched to a different app.

There I found a few interesting guys. One of them I am still meeting twice a month, but we agreed on staying friends.

The other one is the main point of this post. I started messaging him about one and a half month ago. We switched to a messenger app after a week, and from then on we have been nearly exclusively sending voice messages.

We got to know each other through text and we hit it off quite well, we have been talking about our past relationships, past experiences with family etc. and what we are looking for in a relationship.

Then after 3 weeks I was in his area and we agreed on meeting up. We went on a short hike and then went to his place. All in all I stayed with him for 8 hours, also we didn't even touch or anything. Just a greeting hug.

The next day he messaged me and told me he wanted to kiss me goodbye but was too shy (same as me!) so he asked if it was okay to come to the train station (where I was waiting for my train) and he hurried over there just to be with me for 10 minutes and I got my kiss.

The next few days we talked about how we think we both are nice people and we also feel attracted to each other physically. We also agreed on our next date - which was the weekend after. He drove over to my place, and we did a lot of talking and also started getting physical.

I usually don't have sex with a person so quickly but it just felt like everything fit perfectly?

(Just wanna mention here that we message each other all the time between the meet-ups and we talk to each other about our problems, family, work etc) 

Then after a week we met up again. Which was 4 days ago on Sunday. I went to his place and we had so much fun together. I stayed overnight and it felt like a perfect date. When I mentioned meeting up again he agreed in less than a second, and that's how I have my next date in 2 days.

So. What is my problem with this?

My problem is, I feel like I am already in way too deep. While I really do NOT love him yet I can say that I harbor SOME emotional affection for him. I know that he doesn't want a casual sex relationship, but I also know that he is a bit scared/cautious of dating bc his last ex was horrible to him (very manipulative and possessive which destroyed some friendships).

I am ALSO scared because the last few times I thought everything was fine, but after talking with the guys I got rejected and made fun of, so now I have HUGE fear of getting rejected again.

How can I be NOT scared of getting rejected? Everyone tells me to ""enjoy the moment"" but I get anxious when I think about me diving in head first just to get rejected again...

I really enjoy spending time with him, but I personally would prefer to being able to put a label on this relationship.

My best friend also keeps telling me he seems like a nice guy, way better than the last ones who destroyed my confidence (she has already met him once)

I appreciate every comment :) thanks for reading guys!!

I (21F) told the guy (25M) I’ve been seeing for 4 months I couldn’t do it anymore yesterday. I’ve never had a boyfriend, never let myself open up to a man (due to past trauma with my dad leaving during divorce), never kissed or slept with anyone, etc. so this was a big deal for me. 

I met this guy through OLD app and we hit it off immediately. He was so nice, charming, considerate, funny, etc. He texted me every single day, called me at least 6 times a day, calling me pet names and whatnot. We went on dates, made dinner together, he slept over at my place 21 days of the month of February. He said he was falling for me, wanted to meet my parents and vice versa, said he wanted to be a couple with me and just made me feel so loved and wanted for once in my life. This was all within one month of the relationship and so naturally I was hesitant the whole time. 

Then 2 weeks later, his ex girlfriend, to which he would always say is crazy, messaged me on social media saying to be careful with him because he slept with her that last weekend and that he’s manipulative and toxic and whatnot. I was shocked and couldn’t believe it because I slept with him (my first time) that weekend after. I confronted him and he said that she did go over but didn’t sleep with her. My gut was telling me that that was a lie but I liked this guy so much at this point that I overlooked it (stupidly). I asked him when his relationship ended and he said 2 days before we matched online. 

Fast forward, I started to realize that this guy was being shady with his phone when he was with me and I would notice girls’ names messaging him on social media. 

He would continue to say he wanted to be with me until I said I like you and I would like to be with you one day (this was 3.5 months in). He found a bunch of excuses to say that it wouldn’t work out and said but I still want to keep seeing you because I like you, miss you, etc. I continued seeing him and I felt he started to pull away. This gave me so much anxiety and fear of abandonment, I started questioning what I did and my self worth. So much so that I stopped eating (lost 12 pounds), didn’t sleep, couldn’t focus at work, etc. 

He stopped calling me suddenly for the past 3 days but still would reply to my texts. I just felt so desperate and sad and anxious and not myself that I couldn’t do it anymore and sent him a text saying I can’t see you anymore yesterday. He replied saying he knows it’s hard to not catch feelings and wants to be friends and he would text me soon. I said no I need space and he said he hopes he didn’t do anything wrong. I just ended it there and I felt so heartbroken, like someone was stomping on my chest and ripping my heart into pieces. 

This same night, he followed his ex girlfriend back on social media and she followed him back as well. I feel so used and so heartbroken not only about him but about how he made me feel at the end of this. I feel so disposable and that he just used me for a temporary fix/distraction, that he didn’t actually like me and that I could’ve been anyone. How do I leave this in the past and move on? I’m still in shock. 

TL;DR: had my first ever “relationship” with a guy who was chasing me for 3 months until I said I want to be with you and he started fading out of the relationship. My entire mood started to become dependant on whether he would call me or not and I became so anxious I told him I couldn’t do it anymore. That same night, he followed his ex girlfriend (that messaged me warning me about him and he also always called crazy) back on social media.

You will never find “the one”. At least not how it is conceptualized in the West today. To an untrained eye these may seem like rather pessimistic statements; but this is one of the most liberating realizations that a Gentleman can come to. If so many people have found their ‘soulmates’, then why is it that 50% of marriages end in divorce; and of the remaining 50% only 13% still report being happy? This basically means that less than 10% of all marriages have a dynamic that fosters a healthy environment. If this is your first time coming face to face with this idea you are likely going to reject it and this is because your identity and worldview are so tightly wrapped around this concept. Our culture has fallen hard for the Disney narrative that there is only one person in which mystical forces have divinely orchestrated for you to find, and that only this ONE special person can fulfill the ‘prophecy’ of love in your life. Many individuals' entire identity of purpose is so closely intertwined with finding a perfect half. Through the search for the soulmate a man is asking a woman to be his God, his ultimate source of love. 

If a man wishes to have a healthy relationship with a romantic partner he must first find a connection to his own soul. If he does not have a connection to the source of that which he truly is then he will be lost in the world of material. Looking for his source of love from one object to the next. These objects of projection oneness unfortunately, are sometimes women. A man who has not established a connection to his own soul will project his soul onto romantic partners. These are the relationships that initially appear to be the be all end all to your long searching quest for completion. After one date it seems that you have found the love of your life, yet you know absolutely nothing about this other person. After the honeymoon phase has entered completion or the projections begin to fade, the feelings of love will be met with resentment and deep emptiness. This is because an individual who has not created a healthy source of love for themselves will be constantly looking to extract this feel good feeling from their partner.  

What is ironic about swallowing the soulmate pill is that at first you may experience denial accompanied by feelings of pain and loneliness; but as you let go of this belief system it allows you so much freedom. This is the freedom to wake up and recognize that you are already a whole individual not in search of another half in order to become complete. What this does is flip you out of your scarcity script and into a more abundant way of looking at attracting potential partners into your life. It takes you out of the looking for “the one” mindset and it allows you to look for many. It also allows you to focus on aligning with your purpose as opposed to focusing on attracting a mate which indirectly will make you more attractive to the feminine. It should come to you as a relief that you aren’t looking for that ”one” special person who is going to fix all your problems. It should be a joy to know that there are thousands, if not millions of women, on our planet who you would be compatible with.Your reality merely needs to be opened to the fact that you are not looking for one particular dream girl. From this center of an abundant mindset you can begin to live your life in-line with your purpose and recognize that you have many options. Our culture has in some way ostracized the idea of being alone. We are conditioned to be sad or lonely when we are not in relation with a romantic partner. 

We as men use the myth of the soulmate as a protection mechanism. We will sabotage our relationships and we will not approach women under the false pretense that they are not the divine mate. This is actually just a cop-out mechanism because you are too fearful of facing reality. Instead of going up and talking to that cute barista that just made your coffee at \[name your coffee shop of choice\], you will convince yourself that she isn’t “the one” by either consciously or unconsciously finding an imperfection with this particular woman and writing her off. This lets you off the hook so that God forbid you don’t leave your comfort zone and try and get a phone number. Men will go a very long time looking for “the one” as a way of protecting themselves from having to face rejection. Men will sometimes go years at a time looking for their “Twin Flame” or their “Juliet” only to find someone who fits this soulmate archetype in their heads (or just someone actually willing to have sex with them), date them for a bit, fall madly in love with them by the 2nd date, and then get their heart stomped on because they put their romantic partner on a pedestal, fell in love with a false projection, focused so much time and effort trying to force something to work, only to look back on the tornado of emotions they just experienced wondering what the hell just happened. 

Letting go of the Soulmate belief system can be a painful process as you have to kill the identity that is associated with finding some perfect other. The majority of men (and women) today will enter into a relationship with one another without giving any thought or consideration to whether or not they should actually be in a relationship. Most relationships are founded on the feelings of fear and insecurity of not being alone. They are based in a lack of love for  typically requiring others to give something to them that they have been unable to find in themselves.  Many men will settle in a relationship they are not happy in simply because they have a scarcity mindset thinking they will not be able to find someone else or tricking themselves they have found “the one”. If you are unable to enter into a relationship knowing that you have options with women, you are not going to be successful in the relationship. Knowing he has options with women the Gentleman only enters into a relationship with a partner when there is an opportunity that compliments his lifestyle.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,797798,public,self,The Myth Of The Soulmate (Looking for Opinions) [Written from the perspective of a man],0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nlnt7g/the_myth_of_the_soulmate_looking_for_opinions/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

Dating apps, awkwardnesss, the feeling of having to market yourself for others? These are feelings that I struggle with, but for people like me dating can be a lot easier with the right approach.

I used to write my bios and update my pictures with the intent of attracting as many people as possible. And a post about how to set up your dating profile actually brought me to this subreddit for that reason too. (They were giving advice on how to get more attention basically)

To me, that mentality is counter productive in dating. Once you really know yourself, your likes and dislikes in a partner, and what YOURE looking for, you can stop paying attention to what other people are looking for.

And by that, I mean you can just be brutally honest about what you want. You shouldn’t be trying to attract the most amount of men or women, you should be trying to attract that ONE that is most compatible with you. Be as honest as possible, and that person will be easier to find.

If you can, even some embarrassing things. For example, I was jobless and without a car last time I used dating apps. I put that in my bio, because it’s information that might be a dealbreaker for someone else. And the more people I’m turning away over superficial things, the higher chance I’m going to attract someone who cares about the same things I do. 

I’m pretty down to earth, I’ll give anyone a chance if they make me smile, regardless of life situation. And because I want someone like me, being unashamed and up front about your flaws and interests can save you time in the long run. You really don’t want to attract the most amount of people. You want to attract the most compatible ones, and they are hard to find.

I already reached out to my therapist few months ago but it doesn't help me.  


Back in September 2020 I started dating a woman and we kept seeing eachothers for 2 months. We were matching well but she realized I was catching feelings for her and it was too fast. So after a terrible but honest talk on November 25th (where we realized we couldn't match on the emotional part) we stopped talking. I reached back to her in February hoping that we could start over but it wasn't possible anymore... after few messages she stopped replying and I decided to delete Telegram as a coping mechanism. It's been 6 months since the last time we saw eachothers. We never had anything physical but she was so smart and beautiful, I loved our conversations and walks in the park. I really felt a connection with her as it never happened with anyone. 

I dated other people after her and had hookups but after 6 months I am still thinking of her, still want to reach out to her on Twitter even after the double rejection... I feel hopeless, I want to move on but I also wish deep down she could write me. This will never happen, she moved on from me for sure. I don't know why I still overthink about her and imagine scenarios that will never happen... we haven't talked in 6 months. I feel dumb at this point, we just dated, we weren't in a relationship, I don't understand what's wrong with me. I can't fake it out anymore, I keep telling myself that it will go away but it doesn't. Hell, yesterday night I also dreamed of her. Since November I dreamed of her 3 times, never had this with another person. 

I swear, I don't know what to do anymore. Maybe someone can tell me something or maybe it will be only a rant.

Went on a first date last Thursday, went well, got along, she texted me after that she had a great time. I was leaving town the next day and returning Monday, so I said we should do it again when I get back and she said yes.

We texted off and on all weekend, nothing intense but just a bit of chit chat.

Sunday night I sent her a text asking when she may be available to get together this week and she responded Monday morning saying that she may be working late all week before she leaves town the next weekend and doesn't know her schedule at the moment, she went on to explain that she lost an employee at work (this had been mentioned as a possibility on our first date), and needs to reshuffle/transition people and only has a week to do it. Then asked if I fly back on Monday, which i said yea.

Totally understandable, and probably stressful, so obviously she is busy. I texted her saying basically that really sucks that that happened, what a pain it must be, and that that's a lot to deal with.

Followed that up with ""I am really flexible in the evening this week so just let me know!""

And didn't hear anything back after that. I don't want to lose touch with her, especially just because she is having a busy week, that I totally understand. Now to the question, do I just leave it at that? I don't want to bug her.

23yo/M here, I've been talking with a girl for the past couple of months (have only gone out once, but text nearly every day).
She in a way called me out on not initiating plans with her (which kind of upset me, because I feel like I have to some degree) but I'm realizing that I have a difficult time expressing interest. I am interested in her, but I feel maybe it's the vulnerability of expressing this that prevents me from doing so. 
The past girls I've talked to have always been the ""chasers"" and so I have never had to do too much work.

Ive (23m) have been seeing this girl (22f) since the beginning of this year. We met on tinder and started meeting/ hooking up weekly. We discussed if we were seeing anyone else and she said no and that she deleted tinder and I said that Im talking to other girls but not seeing them. Things were getting more serious then one week she told me that she just came from another date. I became distant after that but we still met. She began to post tinder messages on her private story from other guys and even began to post snapchats of her and other guy friends late at night drinking beer alone. I think this was to get me jealous. I said enoughs enough and broke it off with her. She cried and said she thought I was seeing other people too, and shes crazy about me and wants me back. We gave it another shot. 

She told me she loved me and we really became close, going on dates. I said I want to take things slow because I dont trust her yet. Again she began to post guys on her story late at night alone at like 1am and other things to try to make me jealous I feel. I again said I dont like that and she understood and said she would change, only to hide her story from me. I became distant and redownloaded tinder and ended up matching with her friend. We had a fight but really talked and said how we are in love with eacother and we wont see anyone else despite being unofficial.

We worked that out and ended the school year off well despite all that nonsense. We told each other “I love you” and we are both crazy about eachother. She is truley in love with me and texts me all day seeing when we can meetup. We arent official right now and she wants to be. However, I don’t trust her fully and am constantly seeing her previous tinder flings like her posts on instagram and her comment on some guys photos. Its messing with my peace of mind. Im in love with her truly and she assures me shes loyal to me 100%. Im unsure if I should move on or try to make it work. She is so willing to make us work and she wants us to be a committed couple. I dont know how to proceed or if I should trust her. Im hesitant because I dont trust her based on previous actions, she wants to try again but Im fed up with how she acts and what she posts even.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,797967,public,self,Anger and jealousy,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nlqle3/anger_and_jealousy/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

The next day she told me again how awesome the date was and she's looking forward to the next one.

Since then, however, things have gotten really quiet. It started on Sunday, she didn't reply to my messages for hours which I was okay with but thought was odd. Throughout the week she's gotten more distant and has simply stopped replying.

I dont think I've given her any reason to change her mind and she hasn't given me any clue as to why she's stopped talking. 

One friend suggests she wants me to work hard and be persistent. Another friend suggests she's just not interested.

So my boyfriend and I fight a good bit. He’s pretty mean to me and I try my best to stay nice but i struggle. He hurts my feelings A LOT. I totally understand that both of us can be in the wrong, i don’t disagree with that at all. I am not claiming to be in the right. 

My boyfriend and I won’t hang out for a week straight and it hurts my feelings. He won’t even budge to make plans. I mention it and he will say that it’s my fault because I didn’t ask. It wouldn’t be a problem if we facetimed, but he hates to facetime, because I won’t show my face completely.But he always calls his friends everyday over an xbox party and there are no faces shown. So why can I not show my face. He is totally okay with going a WEEK without speaking at all. Just text. That’s it. I have a feeling he just doesn’t care to see me. He can go days without leaving the house and having no human interaction. I like to see people. Both of our love languages are physical touch, so I don’t get why he doesn’t want to see me. I stopped texting all lovey dovey because I would rather do it in person. Then he gets angry with me if I “text dry” It’s like he only wants to be in the relationship to text eachother. But i want more. 

I told him how I was afraid when we both started to get busy in the summer (work and sports) we would only be able to hang out for 2 hours every 3 days. He said “so what, it’s better than nothing. it’s not like we need to hang out everyday.” He then sent me a tiktok saying that hanging out every day is something to not do in a relationship. It hurts my feelings. I wasn’t asking to hang out everyday. I was nervous that we wouldn’t hang out at all. He doesn’t even care. He’s thinks it’s okay that he doesn’t want to hang out with me, but that means that I would have to text him every 3 minutes. It’s insane. I don’t think we should have to text all the time. We are not in a long distance relationship.

Most women are forced to marry men who are much older, much taller, richer, etc. It gives the idea that women are beneath men. 

My family is quite tall, im tall as well, we value size because it's dominant especially as a man. Somethings are just inherently dominant 

And i live in north America, it's the same thing, but with choice, men still date smaller women, and women date bigger man, maybe not the most extreme, but it is a repeated pattern among most relationship by choice.

Nothing wrong with having preferences and standards, but that doesn't mean it has zero effects on society. A lot of people don't like to admit that.

I don't blame women for seeing some men as predators, because it can look predator for men to go from smaller. Do I agree with this mentality, no, but not surprised it exist

I don't blame some men for seeing some women as inferior. If want a bigger man to make yourself feel smaller, it can look like a inferiority complex. Do I agree with mentality, no, but it is incredibly hard to make assumptions.
