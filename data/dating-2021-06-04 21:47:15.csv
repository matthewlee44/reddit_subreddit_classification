2,nsm53r,1622862019,Should I Ask Out A Co-Worker?,"I [M28] am thinking about asking out a co-worker [F23] of mine.

I'm in a new job that I moved more than a few states away for, so I don't really have anybody to hang out with. It was my birthday last week and I asked a bunch of my other (mostly male) co-workers to come out with me to a local bar to celebrate and most of them declined. She said yes and got a few of my male counterparts to tag along, so already in digging the fact that she was kind enough to come out with me on my birthday to celebrate (even if it was with other people).

I enjoyed hanging out with her and would like to do it again. But I'd like to do it with just her. We're friendly around the office and she seemed to enjoy coming out with me too. But part of the problem, other than the fact that she's a co-worker, is that this is a *very* professional ,white collar (literally) job. Everybody dresses business formal every day. So I'm not working some rinky dink job that doesn't matter. I don't want to ask my co-worker out and have it blow up in my face.

I already sort of attempted to ask her out, by the way. Asked her last Friday morning at work if she had any plans that night and she said she had to go to a baby shower. I know this was a legit excuse because she had mentioned it when we'd gone out for my birthday and I'd just forgotten. Anyway, I'm not sure if she could tell I was trying to ask her out or if she thought I was just making conversation. I didn't want to be too direct because... Well... We were at work. And there were other people around. 

The other potential problem is that she's an intern. I am a full-time employee. I am by no means in a senior position within the company. Not even close. However, I *am* above an intern. I don't want it to look like I'm leveraging my marginally higher position to coerce her, etc. That's not what I'm trying to do and that's not how I want it to look either. 

Anyway, I want to try to ask her out again to see how things work out. But I'm not sure if I even should and, if I should, how I should do it. It's hard to get her alone at work to ask since we don't work directly or closely with one another. But looking up her phone number in the company directory and texting her or sending a friend request on Facebook and asking her via DM don't seem like great options either. 

If she says no, I'll be fine. I'm not the sort of guy to make life hard for women who don't feel the same way about me as I do them. But I also don't want to find out down the line that I missed an opportunity. However, I also *really can't fuck up this job.*

What do you guys (and gals) think? Should I do this? Is it worth the risk? I have a good female friend who's told me she thinks it's ultimately a bad idea. But I wanted outside opinions.

My feelings for him are really complicated and I think it's the same for him. He's super sweet, funny, smart, humble, and I can tell he does try to be a better person everyday. I really like him. ANd by the way we talk, It seems like he is too. but **keyword** sometimes. But It could be just me, as I over analyse things and have a great amount of anxiety about everything.

I recently talked to my friend about him (today actually) and she says ""He only wants one thing. I'll leave it up to you to think about what that means."" I don't get it. Like I understand what she means and I guess he can say/do iffy things but I'm ""the past, is the past. its ok."" kind of person. Also we're both quite religious (not Christian) and that kind of thing is forbidden before marriage in our religion. There was also a thing where he dated someone and moved on *very* quickly to another girl. I talked to girl #1 and she said ""It was while not after"". I don't know if i'm misinterpreting that, but that kind of scares me because I've never been in a relationship and he's been in 2-3.

I'm just really confused about everything right now. I really like him and he's been so nice too me for so long, so i don't understand that he could want ""only one thing"".

I'm lost. what do you guys think?

5,nsmb2u,1622862596,Concerned i'm not feeling a spark,"Ive been on three dates or hangouts with this girl and its worrying me that im not feeling any real sparks flying. Im at such a cross roads because ive been texting with her for over a year and were finally hanging out in person and im so confused. I have this sort of obligation to make this work and I have no clue why. I'm adamant to hang out whenever we can, im always texting her, and the other day when she asked me to hangout I was happy. Yesterday we hung out at a lake for around 5 hours we went kayaking, went to a waterfall, went to a secluded area to swim, ate lunch, the whole 9 and it was a great time. But for some reason when I think back to it I sort of have this dread that comes with it and its boggling my brain. I think what it is is that our conversation just isn't that great. We haven't truly riffed yet and gone back and forth on a topic that were both passionate about. We havent had a good laugh about anything yet either. I dont know what to do about any of this. Theres so many factors that could go into this. I cant tell if its cause ive been quarantined for a year and my only contact has been with my best friend of like 12 years, or if im just looking back and focusing on the bad parts, or if im just a slow burner and it takes me a while to get comfortable with someone. I have no freaking clue what it is. I already know that im really trying to make this work but I have no clue why. Ive been with other girls before in this manner but for some reason I have such an obligation to be romantic with her when I cant tell if its fitting or not. The thought of being with someone else is out of the question but I could be having sparks with someone else. Or I couldn't be. Maybe im not a sparks person if thats even a thing and it just takes lots of time for me to like someone. I just have no idea. I dont know what to do about it. Im going to talk to her about it next time we hang out but if anyone here could give some advice it would be greatly appreciated. Reading back on this post I dont even know what youd give me advice about haha. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing about our conversation not being great is we can have some good amount of silence. Silence doesnt bother me in fact I like silence. My job has me work in the car with another guy and I look forward to the days when I know the other guy is also quiet like me. But im always worried that shes uncomfortable with the silence and that shes thinking about being with one of her friends who she could be laughing with right now and having great conversation with them. Im also worried to bring this up cause I can guarantee I think about this so much more than she does. Well I cant guarantee it but I can just tell that im overthinking this tremendously. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ive never overthought like this in my life and I just don't know why I am with her. Every other crush ive had ive easily ridden off when it didnt work. But with her i want it to work so bad. 

I talked to my mom about this and I asked if her and my dad had sparks on their first date and she said yes. I couldnt even type should I just give up on her cause it made me nauseous. But should I? A part of me really wants her and the other doesnt. But when I think of not having her I get ill.

Haven't progressed past cuddling. All times in person have been great. Conversation flows easily and we both consistently make each other laugh.

We won't see each other until the new schoolyear starts again. We both agreed to stay in contact.

We FaceTimed once so far (proposed by me a week ago) and it went very well, too. I was the one who ended it because I had to.

But when it comes to texting, she will mention small things about her day to start convo, but we only message a couple times throughout the day. Often we don't even finish the conversation on the same day lol.

When I mention stuff, I get simple responses like ""hell yeah!"" or ""that's sick!"" depending on what I mention. Never any questions, or meaningful additions. But every time she mentions something like above, I'll ask questions and the conversation will flow naturally. I don't understand it. Two major observations about our conversations that signal contradictory conclusions about her interest.

And on top of this, all dates and FaceTime are initiated by me. She hasn't once asked me to do anything, and it really makes me question her interest again. I plan on asking her next week to FaceTime again, as I don't want to pester her, but holy shit I really wish she'd ask me to.

This is driving me insane, and I'm only a third of the way through summer. It's honestly ruining it, spending all day questioning whether or not she's into me.

Im currently taking online classes, have a job, videogames to play, and a gym to go to. Not sure what else I can do to distract myself.

here's the situation that led me here for context. so my guy friend knows i like this other guy (his ex friend). my guy friend and i are always on and off, he's a very toxic friend and i liked my crush before talking to guy friend again but yeah. one day he went to a party and told my crush i liked him and crush said he didnt feel the same. guy friend comes back and tells me this so then i was badly overthinking abt everything (i am a very sensitive person and tend to take it personally).

the next day i decide to actually go to crush and talk about it at school. i was talking to crush about what happened and he said not to be embarrassed or ashamed, its not me, its just he wants us to both focus on ourselves. he called me attractive and believes i can become a surgeon (its my biggest goal) called me the most hardworking person he knows.

im feeling really confused rn, and im having trouble focusing on myself. i felt like i just chased him instead of letting things come to me naturally, perhaps some internal insecurity about trying to get him to reciprocate. when i get my shit together and he does too, would it be possible i could give it another go? we ate still good friends and communication wise there is no strain everything is as usual.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nsnd59/do_i_have_a_chance/

Or once he sent a pic of him doing a poker face so i replied back in a pic ""poker face"" and he left it on opened but then a couple hours later responded to it.

But when I send him the occasional snap of me doing something he leaves me on opened, and i do send stuff that he could reply to, if he wanted.

Well, I have.
So, I thought about how to fix this problem. The truth is, people‚Äôs ‚ÄúWonderful‚Äù pictures and profile only convey a little. Maybe just 10% of what someone is really like. Often, they‚Äôre the opposite of what they say. No drama means drama, Easy going means Not easy going etc.
I‚Äôm hearing you think, but what about the text conversation?
Well, it‚Äôs so hard to communicate who you are in text and a lot of people that are bad at texting have Wonderful personalities and are great at in-person &amp; some Wonderful texters are horrible in-person.
And what happens after getting all excited about someone‚Äôs pics/profile and texting when the phone call or even better video chat falls flat?
Wow! It can be so disappointing. All that buildup, like a good movie/series with a horrible ending. It can be a real bummer, like dropping ice cream.
If you‚Äôve had this happen a few times, you may have thought, How can I fix this problem?
Intro Video 
If you can immediately see the negatives of an intro video for dating, it could be because the thought of making an intro video sends shivers down your spine. What background/lighting should I use? Where should I shoot it? Standing or sitting? Alone or with friends? Etc. Etc. Then, you may think: What if someone records my video and does something weird with it or you might just be really shy and think, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a Youtuber, I don‚Äôt make videos.‚Äù
But, let‚Äôs explore the positives.
It‚Äôs just a minute or two. You can just sit on your couch, look good, wait until you‚Äôre in a good mood, make the video and upload it. Easy peasey.
And, if someone does something weird with it, chances are you‚Äôll never find out, or even better, maybe you can sue them and get some money. But, let‚Äôs be honest, no one will probably care enough anyways. 
And what about Catfishing? Have you ever seen gorgeous photos and the person looked way different and accidentally was 20 years older?
Or fake spam accounts? I‚Äôd like to see their intro videos! Hahaha
And, let‚Äôs not take our eyes off the prize: Our potential soul mate, true love or even just friend/hook up. Them. The reason we‚Äôre swiping/liking 100‚Äôs of matches in the first place. Don‚Äôt you want them to know you a lot better? Don‚Äôt you want to know them a lot better? Don‚Äôt you want to spend 1-2 minutes (or less) Watching their personal video to see if they‚Äôre even worth a text / text reply that will possibly lead to a call/video chat/date? I do.
And, you could make your video last a few minutes, hours, a day or until you make your next video.
Online dating apps can not only be a real time sink/waste of time, but they can also suck your mental and emotional energy as well as prevent you from trying to connect with people in the real world.
Let‚Äôs be honest. Have you ever stayed in on a Friday or Saturday night, swiped and messaged a match on an app and ‚Äúfelt‚Äù like you‚Äôre dating? Like you‚Äôre making progress in your love life, only to never call/meet this person and actually are totally fooling yourself, hiding at home, actually spinning your wheels‚Ä¶ Well, I have. And I‚Äôm not proud of it. There‚Äôs a little voice inside me saying, don‚Äôt message people, go out and talk to them. Meet someone in real life.
But what if online dating apps were much richer and more efficient with Intro videos? Now we‚Äôre talking!
In videos, you can read body language, posture, emotions, tone of voice and even background choice. I‚Äôm sure some people will make a video at the club or bar vs. living room/kitchen or at the beach. And what about people who smile, laugh, have pets or some interesting hobby. If it‚Äôs in their video, that would be a great ice breaker/conversation starter.
Ok, if you like the idea of an intro video, please message all the apps with a help message right in the app or an email.
What are some other ways to improve dating apps?
It would be nice if the apps gave everyone a score based on activity. How often do they login, send and reply to texts, do calls/video calls in the app and give out their phone number. Especially, how many calls and dates do they schedule and definitely how often do they flake out. Flakes are one of the worst parts of dating: Online and IRL! Obviously, the more active users (And least likely to flake) will get a higher score and you could be a VIP to pay to see their score. Just like Uber, if you can see someone‚Äôs active score &amp; be able to filter for it: I‚Äôm sure you will have a much better experience! My big problems are these:

Matches taking forever to reply to a text / Ghosting
1-2 word / short replies
Boring texts, For example: Hi, Hey, How are you? How was your day? What are you doing? How is/was your weekend?, What are your plans for this weekend? What are you looking for? What are your hobbies? And all these cookie cutter top 100 dating questions.
Not wanting to do phone / video call / date
Bad photos, Can‚Äôt see eyes/face clearly, too far away, too many people in pic, blurry, not smiling, boring look
Bad / short/ cookie cutter profile

Besides being able to filter or know someone‚Äôs activity / credibility score the only thing I can think of is being able to rate someone on a 5 star (with ¬Ω‚Äôs) rating system. If someone takes 3-4 days to reply, ghosts me, doesn‚Äôt want to do a video call/date or even is rude: I‚Äôd love to give them 0-2 stars before I unmatch them.
Also, auto unmatching would be nice. 2-3 days of not replying &amp; I‚Äôd love them to be auto-unmatched. (It could show on my profile and even notify them of being auto-unmatched‚Ä¶)
Lastly, I really want to salute Bumble for allowing voice  and video messages! I haven‚Äôt seen a lot of users add a video to their profile, but I really hope they do and allow you to select the option that you prefer if they do. If people like videos and push for it, I‚Äôm guessing more people will follow this trend and everyone, almost, will win! 
Lastly, let me promote voice and video messages in online dating. It‚Äôs all about saving time. I texted a match, we connected on Whatsapp and I sent a ‚Äúcheeky‚Äù voice message before video chatting (Which I much prefer to calling). What was her reply? She was really taken aback and upset! Like stepping in shit! And what did I do? Apologize, feel bad...Nope, just blocked her on the app and Whatsapp: Double Block! And I didn‚Äôt have to waste time on a call/video chat. A 20 second voice message saved me a 20 minute video chat! Wonderful! Personally, I want someone with a sense of humor who doesn‚Äôt need 6 months to ‚Äúget to know‚Äù me before I can be cheeky. I‚Äôm not knocking the walk-on-eggshells / best behavior approach to dating, but I‚Äôm 100% myself before, during and after 1st dates and if a woman doesn‚Äôt like it--&gt;Block or Double Block: Time saved!
If you have any comments, suggestions or dating experiences involving videos, video chat, calls or even voice messages--Please share!
Happy efficient dating!

I'm just not hungry. So many people love food, and center their lives around it. A great meal is always wonderful, and I try to be mindful that others need their three squares and a snack before they get ""hangry."" Sugar/sweets are also something I actively dislike.

Bringing this up in the dating process always feels odd. One relationship of mine fell apart partially because she hated eating alone all the time, and I was bothered she couldn't last more than three hours without a meal.

34,nspg7i,1622874541,Would really appreciate some help,"Hey everyone, I could really use some help and/or advice from you guys cause I clearly have no idea what I'm doing. Sorry for long post 

There's this one person in my college classes [29F] who I [23M] would talk too occasionally and we had to work on some projects together. She seems like a great person and I enjoy talking to her in class but outside of that the only communication we would have would be about school via text. About a week and a half ago though she text and invited me to one of her friends birthday parties and then mentioned we should watch a playoff game together sometime. I couldn't make it to her friends party, but we set up a time to watch a game together. 

We met up and went to a brewery to watch a game then went back to her house to watch another and had dinner over there with her brother. It was a ton of fun but I honestly had no idea whether it was supposed to be a date or just hanging out because she initiated it. During the evening there were times when it felt like it could have been either and it left me confused. Since it was a lot of fun getting to know her, I asked her if she wanted to go hiking and we set a day for it. I love hiking and she mentioned she wanted to start going more so thought it would be a good idea. 

We ended up going hiking and everything went really well. Weather was perfect, trail was perfect, wildlife showed up which was amazing, and just in general had a really great time. However, at least for me, the vibe felt the same as the first time. Couldn't tell if she thought it was a date or a hangout and to be honest I wasn't sure either. It would seem to be going one way then go in the other direction. Ended up being like a 12 hour ordeal with driving included.

At the end of the day when I was dropping her off I decided to ask what she was looking for cause I was super confused and thought it would be better to just know and then go from there. I basically asked if she was looking for a relationship or something else (not specifically with me) because I wanted to have a clearer path forward. I think it would be cool to try and start a relationship with her cause she seems like a great person, but I would be totally okay with being friends as well. Well cause I'm an idiot and have minimal experience when it comes to these things, I worded it poorly and had to explain my question again and stumbled a bit while talking. She looked caught off guard and basically said she ended a big relationship a year ago and was not sure what she was looking for and then immediately got out of my car. We did day goodbye but that was it. Texted her when I got home saying it was fun and she responded back saying the same. Later in the night she text me sorry for being awkward when I asked that and said it was nice that I wasn't afraid to ask but she never answered my question. Saw her the next day at school and everything seemed as it was before. 

So onto my question, what in the world do I do now? I still have zero idea if she is just looking to be friends or if she is looking for a relationship. Do I just ask her on a date and see how she responds? I don't want to make it awkward again but I just don't know how to approach this. If she just wants to be friends that's great and I would be happy to have a new hiking buddy, but if she is looking for a relationship then of course I would do more then just invite her on hikes.

But I'm also looking for so many more important things in a guy, including personality traits and how he treats me. 

I was actually single for 5 years in my 20's because of self esteem issues and I had such a pessimistic attitude about finding someone that I didn't even want to put myself out there or try. 

I was physically attracted to my most recent ex but the personality traits and his treatment of me were lacking. After him I was seeing a few different guys over the past year but none of them were really ready to give me what I needed. 

It can get quite depressing going through the emotional fallout of these things ending and wondering if there even is someone out there that has all the things I'm looking for but I really want a partner and was pretty determined to do what I could to increase my chances. 

I came across a guy on an online dating app and found him very handsome and was intrigued by what he shared about himself. The thing was that he was shorter than any other guy I had dated (I think he's 5'7). But I decided to challenge the mental limitations I had and go on a date with him. 

We clicked well during the date and attraction was there. By the end of it I was surprised to find that his height barely bothered me. We took things pretty slow and built a connection gradually. Two months in, I'm extremely attracted to him (both physically and personality wise) and he can give me the emotional intimacy that was missing with the other guys I dated. 

I'm really grateful to have met him and just want to share the advice of challenging your mental limitations about dating. You have nothing to lose by going on one date with someone and you might surprise yourself. I also think it's good to give things a chance and not write someone off in the early stages because it can take some time to get a good sense of what someone is really like.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nspz9r/i_decided_to_try_something_different_by_going_on/

When I arrived she told me we could use the table in her bedroom. And I was like, wait, isn't the table in your living room bigger...? And she's like, oh okay then, you're right. But then as we're working on it, she said we could take a break and I said sure. She said want to come into my bedroom, I can show you this new dress I bought!

And then I realized, oh my god. What am I doing? So I said yes, and followed her into the room. And here comes the worst part. In the worst timing possible, I got a sudden text from my mom. She told me about my grandma's terminal cancer diagnosis. I was NOT expecting this shit, as my grandma has been healthy her whole life and she's only in her 60s. And fuck did this hit me hard.

I was literally inside her room when this happened, sitting on the bed with her. She saw the look on my face and asked me what's wrong. I told her.

And she literally said ""oh that sucks"" and then continues talking about her new dress and then giggles if I mind her changing into the dress now. Like, she did not give two shits that my grandma has literally months to live. I thought she didn't hear me so I repeated what I said, and she said ""yeah I heard you"" and then continued talking about her dress and her room. I put my head into my arms because i couldn't process what was happening, and she just started getting her dress from the closet. I just made an excuse and left afterwards.

Well all I asked was he moved to Canada with me and he kept saying yes then no then yes but never made an effort to move forward to which I gave him an ultimatum and ended up breaking off...

A few weeks after the break up my best friend called me and told me my ex was in jail (wtf right! Wait for it)
Apparently he was a con artist scamming girls for money.
One of those girls tried to commit sucide (luckily she didn't die) but she blamed him and she pressed rape charges too.
He was also officially engaged to another girl, his parents involved in this (his parents knew about me they met me ! So I am assuming they were involved in this).
I digged around and found out he was scamming 6girls at one point.


It's been almost more than 2 months to it and I am trying VERY HARD to say fuck it and move on and mind you I have managed to put out a happy brave face ...
But there are days and nights like tonight where I my brain is saying you are brave, you are strong and kind and you deserve better.... AND THEN there is this voice ""you were never loved and never will be"" and in this moment I feel like I can go to no one to just talk.
I feel like the world would be a better place without me (I won't harm myself that's not what I mean) but maybe I should stop getting attached to people in any form bcoz they all leave and I don't know why.

50,nsrzfj,1622885412,First date. Please help.,"So I met this chick on tinder. We matched and I started the conservation. Nothing special just casual. We exchanged snaps and started texting there. I asked her out for Netflix and chill at my place. I know it sounds dumb for a first date but the reason I asked for Netflix and chill is because my state has implemented strict lockdowns due to covid, meaning no going out in public, no restaurants, bars open, etc. So I thought this would be best option. Also fyi I wanted to bang the shit out of this chick cause she‚Äôs super hot and you know what Netflix and chill leads to lol. Anyways she said yes and we discussed more about our ‚Äòdate‚Äô and she seemed pretty excited and eager to meet me too.
However, then is I asked her if she could come over but she has exams this week. She said she would come over the next week. After talking a bit I said bye and that I would hit her up again before the date. Now, there‚Äôs this silence between us for a week leading up to the date. 
My question here is am I doing it right? Should I text her this week or just hit her up a day before the date just to remind her? What to do during the ‚ÄòNetflix and chill‚Äô session?

He's whiny. Yesterday he bought a cupboard and set it up in his apartment, and now he maybe can't meet me today bc ""his back hurts"" like dude, either your body is really effed up if you can't even do that without hurting yourself in your mid 20ies or you need to quit whining bc what the heck. Also, when I asked why sore muscles would be a reason not to meet, he hinted towards sex. Dude, if you only want to see me if we can have sex... just no. 

He's lazy. Never gets up before 10am, never really does anything besides the bare minimum. Keeping his household up and running while attending (ONLINE!!) university is already exhausting for him. My last relationship was with someone like this and I just can't anymore, this kind of mindset is dragging me down. I just can't. 

He might be playing me. No real reason why I believe that, but I've learned to trust my gut. I'm not usually having trust issues with people but I do not trust him. He's got a sketchy vibe with the whining and the excuses. 

I think I may have to break this off before it goes too far. I'm just a bit disappointed. It's been a month or so and this is already circling the drain. I have bad luck when it comes to relationships. UGH.

I'm traveling around Costa Rica and I met this American girl. We were attracted from the very beginning and we had sex the day after meeting each other. The day after that she was leaving for another place in the country. At first I thought it was just casual sex, but we got so hooked that I ended up traveling to where she was, to stay just 5 nights.

Now that I'm here I'm meeting her everyday. Usually in the morning and in the afternoon/evening too. However, I met this waitress at a restaurant nearby too. I was having lunch alone and she was staring at me so bad. Honestly she is super attractive and she was clearly interested. I asked her to come to order a coffee, and when she approached me, the sexual tension was unbearable. 

After I had finished, I called her again to get the check. She asked me how the coffee was and I said it was really good. I asked if the coffee came from Costa Rica, in Spanish (""Es de Costa Rica?""), and she said ""Yes, I'm from Costa Rica"". Then I told her that I was asking about the coffee and she seemed embarrassed.

Looking back on it, I really wanted to get her number and meet her before I leave, but on the other hand I'm also kinda ""dating"" the American girl while I'm here, so it would have been risky.

Basically my ex (24M) broke up with me (24F) because he didn't want anything serious after coming straight out of a serious relationship and I wanted something serious. I could have chilled out more than I did, looking back, but that fact would still be the case. During the breakup and whenever we've talked about it since, my ex has always said that it didn't have anything to do with me, that he could maybe see a serious relationship between us one day but that's just not what he wants right now. He admits it's literally the cliche ""it's not you, it's me"" and I believe that he genuinely believes that. But I also don't know if that can actually be the case. No matter how little I might want something serious right now myself, if he or another guy I thought was wonderful enough came along, nothing would hold me back, especially not me. I also have to acknowledge that not everyone thinks like I do though, and my ex definitely operates on an alien wavelength to my perspective when it comes to relationships.

I'm not invested I'm the outcome anymore, I'm all the way through the breakup grieving process, I'm just curious to hear others opinions. I like to have a clear path forward (thanks anxiety haha).

For a little more info, for the three months we were together, he was extremely torn between how little he wanted something serious and how amazing our time together was. He said on numerous occasions that he couldn't believe he had gotten this lucky, that I was ridiculously out of his league (untrue but such are insecurities) and we had the absolute best time together.

The way I see it, if she's into me, how I ask her won't influence her answer. As in, she won't just say no because I asked over snap instead of FaceTime.

My girlfriend has a good guy friend that I've meet 4/5 times at parties and out, we get on well and I can see us being guy friends, and he has invited me and my girlfriend out for drinks multiple times with him and his girlfriend. We both love spending time with them. 

My girlfriend works weekend evenings, as she works in a bar, but this weekend he messaged to see if we wanted to hang out with him and his gf. I told him that she was working and it would be great to arrange a time for all of us to spend time together, but he then asked if I'd like to come out for drinks anyways on my own with them.

I was excited to be invited out and to spend some time with new people, however when I mentioned this to my girlfriend she got very upset that I even contemplated hanging out with her friends. 

She said that she has said no many times when I haven't been able to make it and says that it should have been a clear ""no"" from me without any thought. 

I'm now very confused and not sure what I've done. 

I can see how she doesn't want me taking over with her friends and that she has sacrificed for me, but then again I don't have many friends in the city and my other option is spending Saturday night along while my girlfriend works.

But i do am financially independent and although difficult sometimes, am living off my own since the last 5 years

So I(25M)have family friend of ours. They have 4 daughters and I used to be in a chatting only sort of relationship with the 2nd daughter(call her A) when i was 17. During this time, I found out that i had feelings for the 3rd one(call her B) and then wrapped up the whole thing with the A and confessed to B. I know this was the worst thing i could do, but as a teenager i didnt know what to do i was pretty much a brainless person during this time.
Well as you might think, the whole thing blew up but somehow we continued staying friends. We cleared the situation between us the youngsters and didn't tell anything to our families. 

Some months passed and she also confessed her feelings and we decided to not be in a relationship but just wait till we were old enough and we can marry. Well we held on to this and 3 years ago we wanted to finally to persue, but my father objected to it because of the other family's financial issues. He didn't want me to carry the burden and resolve their problems. During this time A sort of insulted me, when all youngsters were together and i sort of lost my shit. i think she did it deliberately to cause a drama and so that our families fell apart, well it all happened. I and B had almost no  contact, but i couldn't just stop thinking about her. I recently tried again to get my father's blessings but somehow he wasn't budging. Anyhow i ignored it and talked with B about how i am planning to unwind this mess and she said that she liked and still wanted to marry me. 

Now B is good friends with my younger brother and she told him that she didn't like me and how should she get rid of me. My Brother told me to stop going after her. I asked B about it and she straight denied it all and said she wanted to marry me, she doesn't know why my brother is trying to sabotage this. When i asked my brother he sent me the screenshots of the chat and it was all true what he told me. B again started to shove the blame on my brother and then on my aunt, straght away lying about the whole thing instead of apologising for the mess. I would have just let it go. But because of her lying, i realised that my relationship with my brother and my family would suffer in the future if this compulsive lying and blaming were just one part of her personality. I then told her i didn't want this and we haven't been in contact since then. She has been saying around that my brother wants to subotage this whole arrangement and he is the one to point fingers at and tbh he is also shocked at her behaviour just as i am. My mother who always wanted to see us together is now also against us being together because of this situation. 

The Problem: i seriously can't stop thinking about her as i have been in love with her since most of my adult life, never dated anyone else. I don't know if i will be attracted to anyone else the way i am to her( haven't been in the last 7 years). I somehow picture her as my dream woman. It has been 2 weeks since all this happened and i still am constantly dreaming about her and waking up in the nights because of them.

Advice needed: Am i the one who is wrong here by throwing away our chances of being together just because of this lying and should i just forget everything? 
If not, How can i get over her?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nsxh4d/should_i_just_ditch_her_or_maybe_i_am_seeing_the/

87,nsyhen,1622907684,Help!,"Hey everyone,

So, I‚Äôve been in a relationship with this guy for a year and a half. We‚Äôre gay ‚Äì I‚Äôm 33 and he‚Äôs 41. The relationship has been a bit rocky and he‚Äôs broken up with me twice, stating that it wasn‚Äôt what he imagined a relationship to be like. As a side note, this is his first relationship (his sister is 44 and has never had a relationship). He came out about 6 years ago, to the horror of his father, who I have recently met, but refuses to acknowledge our relationship. His parents‚Äô marriage is also really unhappy (his dad will simply go to bed for days on end sulking and punish his mother psychologically). Another note, his mom does all his cooking and laundry, and his father comes to the flat without warning to check if everything‚Äôs ok, which I really hate. I was in my apartment the other week and his father just walked in and barely said a word to me. My boyfriend was annoyed but didn‚Äôt really bring it up with his father. His mother won‚Äôt dare argue with his father either. Anyway, we‚Äôve been talking about going to the UK, where I‚Äôm from. He was semi on board with the idea and did an interview, and was offered a position, which he‚Äôd be beginning in October. Basically, today, we was really sulky and I asked what is wrong and he just said nothing, I need to tidy my apartment and need some time to myself. Then he said, I‚Äôm just not the kind of person who can leave my home town. No further explanation. That was this morning and I‚Äôm still waiting for him to call. Another thing possibly of interest is that he‚Äôs on antidepressants and has a tendency to be pretty negative, like both his parents (he‚Äôll often say, I‚Äôm horrible, please leave me, you deserve so much better, I just want a solitary life with no change). He also keeps telling me I need more muscle for him to be attracted to me. He is very kind and thoughtful though, which is why I‚Äôm still with him. I was also looking to building a life together in the UK. Anyway, I now have no idea what to do. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs going to leave me. Any advice would be much appreciated. I basically feel like he could leave me at any time.

I‚Äôm sure you can see the bumps in the relationship in my posting history.

89,nsz12z,1622909167,Am I imagining things or do I have a chance?," 

I am not used to people being very friendly so it can be confusing, also I haven‚Äôt socialized properly in a long time before moving.

There‚Äôs this guy but I cannot tell 100%. if he is attracted to me or not. He is Japanese and speaks some English but he tends to be nice. He actually more outspoken with other people and he is shyer with me, not sure if it is because I speak more and he has said he is not confident about his english.

When we met he asked me for my name and offered some food at the school party while he was serving tables (language school, he had a party with food), when we met after a while I got near him and another girl, they let me choose a song etc

We had a long convo about a cultural thing and Japan and he seemed attentive, smiled and he was mirroring my body language too, eye contact etc

After that he walked me outside and asked me for my Ig and number, then he said bye. The conversation lasted a lot and we talked 2 hours or so, we were some of the few people who didn't go to bed lol it was 1 am

All students from language school went to a bar last Tuesday and he ran after me and stopped me to say, asked me if I was going scuba diving etc

I said maybe but today I realized I couldn‚Äôt go (period came randomly lol) so I told him but he loves swimming so he decided to go anyway before he told me.

The same night he invited me to go to the beach and there was also another guy he met there. He asked me about what tv shows I liked and I said South Park so he googled it and checked it out.

We had a barbecue at the school and initially, he only said hi etc, he talked with other people then he sat close to me and we talked and seemed cool. He made me choose a song and asked me about my music taste. He also patted me on the shoulder randomly but idk what it means, it can't be anything

I noticed sometimes he is hesitant and I asked him if he wanted to sit outside and he said no because it was cold (lol wut) then he saw me getting a cup of ice cream and he picked the spoon for me because I forgot, told me about he saw when he visited Italy (I am Italian but I am living abroad atm).

I stood very close and felt the urge to put my arm around him but I didn‚Äôt because I didn‚Äôt want to seem weird, then he went to talk with other people.

I see sometimes he stands around me and generally he is friendly but I have seen that he is less shy when he speaks Japanese and more confident but quieter when speaking in English.

I remember the first time we met he asked me if I did sport because I am fit and when the topic of relationships came up he said he is single etc and asked me If I have ever been in love. The topic came up because we overheard it while two people were talking about Japanese culture, I was quite surprised when he said people have to be in an official relationship to kiss, etc

He mentioned he had a girlfriend in the past but I misunderstood and he cleared it up by saying he did but now he doesn't have one, I said I never had a boyfriend too. He asked me if I have been in love and we talked a bit about the topic.

Some things make me think he likes me in general but some are confusing lol

Also recently I was supposed to go for dinner with one girl and her other 3 guys joined and I sat at the same table as him. He talked a lot and I pushed him on the arm and he did it back, he liked my earrings and touched my backpack before asking if the brand was popular in Italy.

Yesterday I noticed he saw around me without speaking or saying much but he smiled at me often. Sometimes if I looked at him he looked away quickly, I couldn't tell if he was looking at me or another girl. He is nice to everyone but idk, I even suspected he liked her instead because everytime I looked at him he looked away or behind me where the girl was. This happened a few times.

He is helpful and sends me random messages to tell me random stuff like do you know that supermarket, he also told me he goes to the gym at the residence where I am now

Yesterday we were at a party but I was not feeling it because I was tired and I was busy all week. I gave him some glances, sometimes he smiled or sometimes he looked away or we talked a little.

I said bye and left early but when I got outside he followed me and asked me why. I jokingly asked if he missed me and he said yeah and smiled so I told him to come to visit me here where I am.

He is friendly in general but he is often awkward when he stands there, he is around me but doesn't speak up (not always, we kinda talked and he is always nice).

IDK sometimes I am paranoid I am reading too much into it but he texts me first and I am not sure with the body language.

I am kinda getting a vibe but I am not sure, there's another turkish guy who is direct compared lol Like he asks me to meet and flirts, he even kissed but he is too old for me and he said it is nothing serious.

I want to flirt but I am anxious I might seem annoying or weird or even creepy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nsz12z/am_i_imagining_things_or_do_i_have_a_chance/
90,nsz68e,1622909561,Its easier to get over someone who wrong you rather then admitting that they simply don‚Äôt want to be with you,"As the title suggest I wish to share my personal experience how to get over your past love. I noticed there are a few sub Reddit‚Äôs a day asking how to get over someone. So I wish this will help anyone who  still have that person in their head or heart and can‚Äôt get rid of them. 

First identify a true reason why you broke up with them or why break up happened. I found it is easier to get over a person when you believe that they wrong you. Be cheating, emotional abuse or toxic inducing behaviors as long as you believe in your heart that this person wrong you it will be easier to switch from love to hate and from there it is an easy transmission to ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù (or if you‚Äôre a saint for giving )stage. 

Its gets A little more difficult when partner says straight to your face that they simply no longer love you or don‚Äôt want to be with you. It happens, but I believe mind and heart can still be tricked and redirected towards hate emotion rather than love. Because you can find 1 million reasons why this person suddenly decide to change his or her mind. And once you start to heat as described above the ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù stage is nearby. 

So I always advise to switch your brain and heart from laughter hate for anyone who is going through hard times because when you have done so, life will become easier, less stressful, and less self-pitiful.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nsz68e/its_easier_to_get_over_someone_who_wrong_you/

92,nszk3a,1622910630,If a girl talks about you with her friends?,"Hey guys. I recently met this girl and things have been going pretty well. Whenever we hang out, we usually spend hours together just talking or watching netflix until the early morning, we also do things like shopping together and we just got back from a lovely trip to the beach. 

I'm just kind of confused about how she feels about me. I wish I knew, because then I'd know for sure if I should make a move or keep things the way they are. Some people say that it seems like she likes me, others say that she only views me as a friend. 

One thing she does is talk about me with her friends. She tells her friends and coworkers about what we do together and she seems to speak very highly of me. I know this because she told me and I overheard her talking to one of her friends about me, saying that I was a good guy and she has fun with me. 

She also compliments me on my clothes, my eyes, and other features. She has said that I have a cute face. She also touches me pretty often, like a touch on the arm during conversation, or she'll invite me to sit next to her on the couch and scoot close to me so that we're touching. Sometimes she'll come up to me and hug me for a few minutes. I also noticed that if we're walking together she'll kind of brush her arm against me lightly. She likes taking selfies with me, with her arm wrapped around me. 

The reason I'm confused is because when I first met her, she expressed to me that she didn't want to date anyone right now. I've been trying to respect that and not make any moves, but ever since she started getting closer with me, I wonder if she wants me to do something.

Do bonds not matter when two partners face a hardship?


I ask this because I saw a ton of people lately in dating places that go with the idea that if you're not treated as a god by your partner and he's not willing to die for you. While if something happens to them you're immediately allowed to leave them. Those people don't deserve love then?

Of course if you work hard as well then you have absolutely every right to complain and so on.

But when I see a post about someone needed to get 300k from their partner as like an allowance and as soon as that is cut they think of leaving them.

94,nszz55,1622911809,"Guy I like is inconsistent with his communication, but likes my social media posts?","Hey guys. I'm sure this is a simple case of ""he's just not that into you"", but I need insight.

There's this guy I have been friends with for years. We saw each other again recently a few weeks ago and there is definite chemistry. We have been texting a bit back and forth, but this guy is SO flaky and hot and cold with his communication. I initiate the conversation sometimes because I don't play games. But I also know that men like to pursue.

For example, twice in the last few weeks he's said ""I'll call you tomorrow."" ""Would you like to get together next week? Great, I'll call you in a few days."" Well, he never follows through. And I am way too understanding.

BUT...this is the part that drives me absolutely insane. He likes my pictures on social media. It is obvious he's not that busy, he has his phone, and it is super insulting to me that he would put in such a low investment form of communication, but not follow through on his word to make plans. Social media means nothing, but he obviously knows I can see it and that I also can see that he's avoiding me.

I am kind of getting the feeling that he either:  
 \-Doesn't like me or want to see me and is too shy or too cowardly to say so.  
 \-Doesn't see me as a challenge?  
 \-Has a lot going on?  
 I am matching energy on this connection going forward. I've done my part. I will not reach out again, because this behavior is annoying and childish. But the thing is, I like him and don't want to jump to conclusions. Should I just drop it and move on completely, or what should I do if he reaches out again?  
 I want to make it clear as politely as possible that I don't tolerate inconsistency, that I expect directness no matter what. I have standards for how I expect to be treated.  
 I just feel stupid and embarrassed for putting myself out there, pursuing, and being complimentary and too understanding. I want him to chase me. But I feel like I did something wrong, or he's just a loser who can't speak his truth. I feel lost.

I had my second date ever with my gf recently. Since I'm the only one who can drive between the two of us, I drove down and we met at a park near her house. I brought Timbits with me, but I did something mischevious that I am rather proud of. 

The Timbit ""surprise"": My gf likes to explore different flavours of food whereas I only have one flavour I stick by (No matter the food, if I see the flavour I will get it). We always joke about my ""lack of taste"", so I thought I would make the Timbits reflect our inside joke. What did I do? I bought a 10 box filled only with the flavour she teases me about. When I handed it to her and she opened it, she laughed and was pleasantly surprised. I also bought an assorted box of 10 Timbits too so she could try all the flavours the store had.

After the Timbit surprise, we sat down on a picnic blanket and watched the second half of Hamilton (we watched the first half on the first date) and then played a game of chess. It was very fun and we had quite a few laughs as we made stupid moves on the board (we both cannot play well). I let her kill some of my pieces (queen, bishop, castle, etc.) before I decided to go for the win lol.

At the end, we walked over to my car and had the classic awkward silence moment at the end of the date ‚Äì the point where you question if you should make a move. On our first date, I ended with a simple ""I'll see you later, man!"" which was really CRINGE lol (it was my first date ever, you can't blame me XD). This time I was determined to do better, but this is how it went down:

\*awkward silence\*   

Me: ‚Äúheh, I really never know how to end these things‚Äù (kinda funny because it‚Äôs my second date in my life)  

Her: \*chuckles\*   

Me: ‚Äúhow about a hug?‚Äù   

Her: \*smiles\* ‚Äúokay‚Äù  

\*hugs for a second. I probably accidentally hit her with my shoulder\*
