We are not officially a couple. He recently left his job. I haven't heard from him in over a week. I figured he might be focusing on finding work but someone posted on facebook him giving a pep talk to a football team that he is an assistant coach.

Today he posted pics of his best friend's wedding. There is one picture where he is with one woman and they have their arms around each other (waist). I was looking at the body language and they were close but not like boyfriend/girlfriend close. Like a typical friends closeness. There is another shot with them and the newlyweds but this woman is next to the groom and he is next to the bride (couple is in middle). His dad commented on their solo photo (the first one I mentioned) that he looked good but his date looked better (I think she probably is a bit better looking than me. She is a blond). The guy I am dating didn't say they were friends. He said ""you should have seen how the bride looked as they had a gatsby theme."" Shouldn't he have said that they are not a couple???

I honestly don't know what to think. He seemed like a decent guy and into me. He has kissed my hand several times last month as we were holding each other's hands. Either he is being really clueless that I would find that photo offensive or he is being a real asshole. He doesn't seem like the type to do something so cruel but it's possible. If they were dating, wouldn't he just unfriend me? Wouldn't that be easier?

I've dated a guy once who was super into me but after a month, he basically ghosted me so I know a guy who you think likes you a lot can do a 360 and lose interest.

Also this guy hasn't been with a lot of women. I assume he was being honest with me.

There is another photo where he is with the same woman and another woman on his other side. They are both wearing red dresses but the style is a bit different so I don't know if the maid of honour wears a different style but same colour than the bridesmaids. I do wonder if she is the bride's best friend because maybe it was an innocent photo and they are just both single or maybe she has a boyfriend. I don't think he was the best man, even though he said they have been best friends since elementary school. He has not talked about the wedding. He just told me about the bachelor party they had in July.

When I spoke to my friend last month about us, she thought maybe we are moving slow as I would assume he would have wanted to label me his girlfriend after 3 months. Seems odd to me. I did ask him if he was sexually monogamous last month so we are but that doesn't mean we are a couple and that could change at any time, especially if he just met someone.

I'm tempted to give the angry emoji for that picture but it would be ironic if I gave it a heart instead. I generally do not cause facebook drama but I am quite pissed. Maybe he's too nice to dump me so just stopped texting me. My last text to him was wishing him good luck for a job interview he had. He never said thanks or anything about how it went.

Hello everyone! Yesterday I was an invigilator and me and this girl writing the test were staring at eachother smiling many times during the examination.

She didnt ask no specific question, just started asking me what i studied etc, just a chill conversation. A random dude came and started asking genuine questions about the test and didnt leave afterwards. He joined our conversation and I couldnt ask for her instagram as I would feel unprofessional.

We never were together, just friends who would catch up every now and then. We met back in college. Now we are in our mid to late twenties. Our friends who were dating tried setting us up. He saw a picture of me and wanted to meet me. He reached out to me two years ago and we were texting almost everyday. He would send me good morning texts and asked me how my day was. He then came back to my state to visit his friend and I asked if we could go out to dinner and drinks. I wasn’t expecting it to be a date but we kissed a lot and it was a great date. We then went on a walk the following day and we danced and kissed and opened up. I felt really great after those dates and it felt very mutual if that makes sense. Usually I like the guy and he doesn’t like me or he likes me and I don’t like him. 

Anyways, he goes back to his state and invited me multiple times to see him. This was when Covid first started and I was terrified when the pandemic broke out. I explained to him I wanted to wait until things got better. He said he understood. We would still talk and FaceTime every once in a while. Weeks later he told me he’s moving to a farther state. He would continue to invite me but I kept saying no because I was a scared of the pandemic. He’s invited me to thanksgiving, a family members services, to events, etc etc. and I kept saying no because of the pandemic. I would send him a selfie and he would call me up just to say how beautiful I was in it. He even called me the next morning when his family member died. 

We eventually went our separate ways. He got a girlfriend and they broke up months ago. I’m not sure why they broke up. He then reached out to me again. And since then we have been talking he invited me to see him again but I had legit plans so I wasn’t able to. I am vaccinated and much more comfortable going out to places and seeing people.

Also, I am on the autism spectrum, and struggle quite a bit at reading social cues so forgive me if I seem to be missing something obvious.

I (M20) am a student in my first year of university in the UK. For a few weeks now I have become quite good friends with a girl (F18) who is on my course and I also share quite a few of my classes with her.

She is an international student from the US, and I find her very intelligent, funny, pretty and just pleasant to be around generally, very easy to talk too. I think we get along quite well and she seems to like spending time with me (I can't figure out why, but I don't want to push my luck). She has even been teaching me some of her native language after classes after I asked her if she would be willing too (Swedish, her family is originally from there). We also, along with a mutual friend, carved some pumpkins for halloween at her place and have been on a few nights out together.

I like being friends with her, but more and more I feel like I am becoming romantically attracted to her, but I don't want to ask her out, mainly out of fear it would ruin the friendship if she didn't feel the same way. The unfortunate thing is she asked me, along with 2 other mutual friends (both girls btw), if I wanted to pitch in to rent a flat/apartment for the next academic year and I agreed. We'll be looking at potential places in the next few weeks. I am looking forward to it, but it also just complicates things even more.

On one hand I don't want to risk the friendship or make her think I was being friends just to try and get with her, I really like her just as a person and want to continue that at all costs. But on the other I'm afraid of missing out on a chance like this just out of fear, I feel like we have so much in common.

This is super embarrassing kinda because I feel like such a child feeling like I can’t do this anymore because he doesn’t wash his shorts?? 

* please note: I’m on my phone so excuse any mistakes and weird template - Let’s get right into it: 

I’m a female 27, he’s .. male 26. Let’s call him Mike. We work for a really big nationwide company and that’s where we met. We’ve only been “talking” / dating for a little over 2 months and I haven’t felt the need that it should be taken to the next level (relationship) yet. Our dating has consisted of multiple breakfast / lunch / dinner dates, watching movies, etc. And oral. No sex yet though. 

Let me be clear and say this guy has a clean penis (as far as a scent goes and it’s a great size) but boy are his pubes longer than anything I’ve seen but still doesn’t smell that bad so I know this isn’t a std or whatever other UTI thing. 

I get whiffs of his shorts when he’s sitting next to me or we’re cuddling and it turns me the hell off. We are GROWN. This guy truly doesn’t wash his shorts. 

So I’ve turned him down the last couple of times because I can’t go near his shorts without gagging, I’m so turned off by it. I know that the adult thing to do is to talk to him about it, cause it maybe be an easy resolve. Right. 

It’s just I don’t know how to tell him this in the nicest way: 
• Honey, your shorts don’t smell pleasant. Pls. 
• Mike, I’m really into you but I have to let you know .. 
• I’ve noticed your shorts smell like urine, can I help with laundry? 
 
You guys get my point. 
Please understand I’m not trying to be mean or make fun of him. But I truly don’t look forward to seeing him anymore (we fucking click) because I can’t wrap my head around an adult reeking of piss and not smelling it?? Like dude you stink like a bathroom whose walls have been pissed on multiple times.

I don’t want to wait, and you’re going to have a hard time finding someone who will. Sex could bring us closer, can’t we focus on that?” 

I just feel discouraged, as this isn’t the first time it’s been like this. I know what I am comfortable with isn’t for everyone, but that's why I lay it out before anyone spends money/time with me and before I start liking someone who wants different things. 

I have had a few dating phases of just wanting sex and just got it out of my system, it's not about shaming anyone for wanting to have sex/have sex earlier than I currently feel comfortable with, either. 

I just feel discouraged and stupid, I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok guys and girls, because a lot of you asked me about an update after this Friday's date, well, I just can't help it ;) (and also I love sharing stories) so here you got. Second date.

&amp;#x200B;

We met this Friday afternoon and went to a bar because I wanted her to taste a beer I really like, so we went there immediately (btw we hugged when we met). Zero nervousness, absolutely calm (she was too). Also, I didn't remember she was THAT beautiful, I swear she has an angel face. 

We arrived to the bar, ordered and sat down, and we started chatting lots of things (studies, work, etc...) and we spent almost 1 hour and a half there, just talking. On the first date, if you remember, she drove a public car you can rent in the city centre, so it was my turn. We left the bar, just before I remembered I didn't pay the beers by absolute accident, so I told her and we started running away from the bar and laughing lots. I swear it was like some romcom kind of scene hahahaha.

After that, we took the car and I drove for an hour and a half, just going around the city and enjoying that evening drive, laughing and singing to the songs the radio was playing. Super fun time.

Therefore, I parked the car and then we went for a walk near a river in my town. At that moment, I showed her my hand and told her ""Give me yours"" and she didn't hesitate at all to give me hers. During that walk, we didn't stop holding hands and I was like ""Wooooooooooowwww"". Absolute cloud nine I swear.

She needed to go to the same bus station as the last bus was leaving earlier (because we weren't on weekend yet), so we went to the subway in order to go to that bus station. During the whole time we were on the subway, I put my arm around her and she put her head in my chest, started caressing my leg while I was caressing her hair. I told before I was on cloud nine, now I was on cloud eighteen lmao.

We arrived to the bus station, and as we got earlier than the bus, we sat ourselves in a bench waiting for it to arrive. It was really cold around here, I was feeling real freezing, so I told her and instantly hugged her again while we were on the bench. During that, we were talking and as soon as there was a short moment of silence, I grabbed her face carefully and started making out with her. Same feeling as the first one (OMG!!!!!). This one was more passionate than the first one, as we were making out for a longer time (but it was still really short, needing more of it hahaha) and got ourselves real close and cuddling each other. Cloud twenty-seven.

After making out (still didn't know what I was doing lol), we saw ourselves eye-to-eye, she smiled and she put her head in my chest again, hugging each other. Only to realize myself that the bus was waiting to leave, pity. I told her, we stood, and when we arrived to the bus, we hugged and then I told her to wait a moment, and put her mask down and stole again a kiss (becoming an expert in that lmao), and then she picked it up.

Honestly mates, I'm blown away and I feel like I'm day-dreaming absolutely. Just a few weeks ago I was on the verge of absolute sadness due to thinking myself I was going to be alone all my life (even though I was already chatting with this girl). Now I succesfully accomplished these two dates with her, having one of the best moments in my life. Now I understand that caption that says ""You'll never know what comes around the corner"". What a 180 turn.

We are planning to go eat sushi since she wants to go to a restaurant in my town, so there it goes. We have some exams real close, so we will date as soon as possible. 

This is the update mates, hope you enjoy it and like it! Oh, and also thank you soooooo much for the support, advices and congrats you people gave me.

TL;DR: After the date where I had my first kiss ever with this girl, we went for a second date. We had a drink (zero cost haha), we drove, we laughed a lot, we held hands while going for a walk, we cuddled on the sub, we made out at the end.

So I (28m) have been dating this really cool woman (31f) for 4 months now. We see each other 2-3 times a week and things are going really good. We are both cinephiles, foodies and Swifties. She works in a very large Tech company and I work in a hedge fund. Anyways, so I watched the viral video of Oscar Issac and Jessica Chastein and then decided to watch the miniseries ""Scenes From a Marriage"". It was a big mistake, ngl. In the show Jessica had a type ( rock star guys) but she went against her type and married an intellectual academic and eventually their relationship exploded. Now this started ringing alarm bells in my brain, because before me my gf also had a type- creative people like singers, drummers, artists and one painter. On the other hand she never dated a corporate professional like me. Thats a red flag for our relationship, right?

Do people really have a type and if they date outside their type will the relationship succeed? I am starting to get really attached to her so I am thinking its better to get out before getting too attached as it will hurt a lot more. But on the other hand she does really seem to like me and always wants to hang out with me. And I also like her a lot. So I am confused now.

It was going perfectly, he was really like ""drunk"" of me. I have never seen such a behavior in a guy. He was really highly connected and emotionally involved, much more than me. He could see me like somebody to protect, to have children with, to take enormously and extremely care of.

An evening I decided that we could have sex, but I told him that I was not sure because I did not want to have sex with somebody I was not sure to see again.

I realised he did not want to see me again from that night I told him about having sex only at a a condition. This changed all, not the distance. But he was emotionally bound and asked me to be friends. He is also physically very attracted.

I asked about what was going wrong with me and he made a list of things lacking in my personality. I told that I needed more time in order to externalise part of the aspects he listed and to know him more.

The last day of our vacation I was surprised about with how many girls he flirted while walking next to me, so disrespectful. I left his hand and started to look at guys and he immediately started to hug me in a possessive way.

Now he is back home. The first days was quite active in sending me messages and wanted still to play nice jokes. I disappeared in the weekend because he became quite passive in replying me. Today he was also quite short in his answers.

Over the past year, I've really begun to work on myself. I started working out, got into therapy, began a few side hustles for extra $, cut off a few bad friends. Everything independently with me has improved, but still I've had trouble with dating. Getting flaked on, ghosted, stood up, etc etc etc... 

My therapist gave me ""homework"" a few weeks ago to go to a few new places a week, even if only for an hour or so, and strike up a conversation with people. Half of them could be people I'm physically attracted to, but half of them had to be people I wasn't. 

Over the past few weeks, I've been doing just that. I started by going to places during their less busy hours, and not just on Fri/Sat night. I went to a few happy hours, an LGBT+ drag show (I'm bi), a karaoke bar, an open mic night comedy club, a workout class, etc. 

I'm a very introverted person, so at first this was honestly a daunting task. I also definitely felt like people would perceive me as ""the weird girl"" going to some of these places alone. Still, I bit the bullet and tried it anyway. 

And then I realized a few things: 

* When it came to starting conversations with people, most people were way more receptive than I thought. I would simply ask people how their day/night was going and if a topic clicked, suddenly they were the ones feeding off my energy. Not just people into me either - I was laughing with this older woman and how her husband drags her to sports games, talked with a gay guy for an hour about how him and his husband met and gay culture, just a few examples. People LOVE talking about themselves, and when you're interested instead of just trying to be interesting, people will latch on. 

* People generally care way less about you than you'd think. Most people aren't looking at you at any random place and thinking you're a loser who doesn't have any friends. Most people are just minding their own business, and even if someone asks you if you're alone, saying you're waiting for friends or they're meeting up with you is a very common thing.

* When it came to people I WAS attracted to, I approached them the same way I did the people I wasn't, and wasn't goal-oriented. I got a few numbers that haven't gone anywhere, but I still found this method way more successful. A few people were into me but I realized I didn't vibe with their personalities. But I still feel the conversations I've had with people were way more sincere. I got to know WAY more about people I was attracted to over the course of 2 weeks than YEARS on dating apps. I feel the conversations had more value, and on top of that I'm learning to be a better in-person connector and not just rely on a screen. In a way, I almost felt like I've been on more ""dates"" by going out and talking to people, vs on dating apps where I was constantly getting flaked on and wasting so many more hours swiping and endlessly chatting. 

* You can meet people almost anywhere that's social. This idea that no one wants people they don't know ever to talk to them is a huge myth. People don't want to be bothered at the grocery store or walking down the street, and women especially don't want some random only talking to them with the intent of having sex. But people want to make new connections, people want friendships, people want relationships. It's all truly about being socially calibrated and not trying to force a conversation if it becomes obvious someone doesn't want to talk to you.

I know the pushback will likely be that because I'm a woman, of course it's easier. And yes, I'd agree to an extent. But I also took pointers on being more charasmatic from one of my friends who is a bit older, chubby guy in his late 30s. I've watched him light up a room with his energy; this man and many others I know have no problem making connections by being very social and genuinely interested in everyone. 

TLDR; This post isn't to say dating apps can't work for some, I realize they're very convienent and if you enjoy them, cool! 

But if you're one of the people, like me, who felt like you've been wasting years of your life endlessly swiping and swiping and getting flake after flake after flake with not even as much as a date to show for it, maybe this post can inspire you to try another method. 

I know we're living in an era where it seems connections can only be found online, but I promise you people are still out and about and the apps are not the only places you can search for love. 

It might seem daunting initially, but I do believe it also builds a tougher skin and increases the quantity of connections you can make, which by pure statistics will increase your quality eventually.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1094904,public,self,"I stopped using dating apps and started putting myself out there, and I thought my experience might inspire some of you:",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qf4jq3/i_stopped_using_dating_apps_and_started_putting/,all_ads,6,,,

She gave it to me, so that’s a good sign right. She posted something on her story Monday and I made a stupid little joke that she seemed to appreciate. After that, this we’ve been talking on and off all week. 

Idk if these are good signs but:

- She uses a lot of emojis

- Laughs at pretty much all of my jokes. (A lot of “Lmaoooo” and “Lol” in the chat)

- I said this clever comment about her looks that I was pretty proud of. She laughed and said “thank you”. 

- We talk about family life and aspirations (but nothing really personal)

- She doesn’t really reply in a timely fashion. Then again, I don’t either. We’re both pretty busy and motivated people. I just sort of match her when it comes to that. When she does reply, it’s never anything low effort. 

There’s a horror movie that we want to see but I heard that it’s not really an ideal first date. So I’m trying to get to know here more before I ask. My backup date is that we go to a haunted house or bowling.

**Short Story** \- I got a firm answer that the potential is just **not** there for us anymore after dating her for \~3 months. I'm perplexed, the feelings were there and it was mutual for so long but suddenly vanished for her. One day she felt this wouldn't work, and had to end it.

After two weeks of no contact, I called her to see if it was a pacing issue and she said no, she just didn't see us moving forward and then suggested FWB (I firmly said no to friends).

**Context -** this girl has lots of sexual/mental trauma from past relationship. She felt very comfortable while I was dating her (especially sexually). She'd often say we had strong sexual chemistry. To be clear, there isn't another guy(s) that I was competing with either. We openly talked about that.

**Current Feelings -** Anyway, I accepted the offer for now cause I figured I had nothing to lose (maybe a bit of self-respect lol). We met up and we had an incredible time, as expected. We set some rules and **she was very transparent about her lack of feelings towards me**. I've mostly accepted the outcome and am ready to move on but it made me feel sick. 

How is she capable of turning them off so quickly? We even talked about how we liked each other and how I compared to other guys. She claimed I'm perfect, with the best qualities. WTF???

**Question -** I think my problem was, I revealed that I liked her too soon while we were seeing each other. I wasn't a challenge anymore. I still care for her, and she cares about me too but likes me as a friend.. Is there any chance this FWB thing could reignite the potential? Maybe there's something I need to really work on. I did literally everything right...

**Regardless, I'm back on Hinge.** She wants me to find someone else to date and I said the same to her. But 1% of me hopes this could reignite things..

**tl;dr -** I was ready to walk away but girl suggests FWB since we had strong sexual/physical chemistry that she's never felt before.

I gained alot of weight while being on mood stabilizers and anti depressants over the last 7 year and had some tests done and seems they've done some good damage as I now have the metabolism with the speed of an average 63 year old (I'm 29) so losing weight is anything but easy for me. It's something that really kills me as my ex was very verbally and emotionally abusive.. he would force me to exercise for hours and tell me how fat I am and that he was never attracted to me as no one could ever be but I am a good person and that's why he chose me but he has to think of his ex when we have sex because I'm just so gross. I eventually ended up in hospital with extreme somatic symptoms and had what I'd call a breakdown. He then left one day back to his country without even a discussion. So the fat thing is a huge trigger and kills me..
My new partner has straight out told me I was fat. We met on tinder and he told me that I was definitely ""rounder"" in person and hinted that I deceived him which is insane since my profile said in a very not so subtle but humourous way that I was fat. When I mentioned this he just asked then why can't he use the word fat when I did.
He's made remarks about a shirt not being his as he didn't recognise it and when I said that it was definitely not mine he insisted that it must be, I said that perhaps it's his exs shirt and he scoffed and said that his ex would never need to wear an extra large. 
He has pointed out fat under my knee and asked what was wrong with my legs.
And tonight he told me he'd be happier if I was thinner.
I'm not a lazy person....I have a 6 month old baby...I clean all day....I'm painting his place myself...I never stop working and watching our baby. I have severe chronic back pain that's been around for years, I'm on 3 schedule 5 pain meds to control it and I'm still in excruciating pain ALL day. also, my pregnancy was so extremely difficult as I had Hyperemesis Gravidarum. I've had a really tough 2 years but I'm not lazy and I work hard all day.. I work through pain that brings tears to my eyes. I have no time for myself ....no time to even pee some days. I barely find time to drink a full glass of anything and my health and mental health is definitely in the decline. 
He has now gotten into the habit of trying to push me into going to a 2 hour boxing class every day as well as telling me to do yoga. The more I explain that I'm in pain and the doctor said that the disk's in my back are too inflamed to exercise, the more he just then suggests yoga. 
I don't have any time for myself at all and now I need to on top of a full day of watching the baby, cleaning, painting, making dinner etc all while on the verge of tears. Because of the insane amount of pain I'm in, I must now go do more and do high intensity training for two hours because I'm fat. I've never felt anything negative about him or the way he looks. No one is perfect but he's always been perfect to me. 
Am I wrong to feel absolutely sad and depressed about this?
I'm considering taking illegal weight loss drugs even though I know it is incredibly unhealthy and even banned in the country just to lose enough weight that I don't feel absolutely disgusting every single day of my life...
It's incredibly hard to know that you're not what your partner wants.

He makes eye contact with me, surprised to see me, and then proceeds to look at another car. This person was picking him up. 
I left right away because I felt really stupid. I felt like I was unwanted and like he was shooing me away. 
I got home and felt very upset. I just wonder why he felt like he couldn’t tell me someone was coming to get him. Maybe it’s because he doesn’t want me to see where he lives. Or maybe it’s because he was trying to hide something from me.

Two guys asked her if they wanted to join/dance with their group and talked to her for like a whole 10-15 seconds (which is pretty long for a party context) before talking to me to get my name, etc. I don’t know why they didn’t approach me first, or why they waited so long to talk to me. I feel like they just did this out of courtesy so I wouldn’t feel left out. Granted, she was drunk and was dancing much more enthusiastically/happily and I was sober and was already feeling self conscious about what people thought of my looks, but I can’t help but feel like the real reason is because she was pretty to them and I was unattractive. Both of us are young 20’s, fit, and dressed nicely, I think her face is so cute but mine is weird so no matter now nice my body is and how much I work out, maybe that turns people away. 

I walked away for a second to take a breather cause I just felt really humiliated, then Idk I felt really emotional and angry and came back to ask one of the guys why he ignored me. He said he didn’t recall that but he’s sorry if they did. He then tried to ask to dance and said I was cute as hell, but I truly think that’s just consolation/pity because it’s clear I felt left out and if he really thought I was so cute he would have approached me first during that encounter. He just seems to be saying this after the fact. They call everyone cute anyways to coax them to dance with them. I asked if he thought I was ugly and he said no, but I realize that’s a dumb question to ask because who would tell a person to their face even if they actually believed it? I feel like if he truly didn’t think I was ugly the answer would be something incredulous like “Are you kidding? How could you think that?” Finally I asked if he thought my best friend was prettier, to which he said ”I’m not going to compare”After which he said “no” after I asked one more time. 

I think my behavior was regrettable and I’ll admit I think I have some emotional and mental issues to work on, and am working on finding a therapist for my self esteem. But in the mean time, the fact that they talked to me only after talking to my friend for some time, his lack of incredulity when I asked if I was ugly, and him saying it’s rude to compare (very PC response) is telling me that I really am unattractive to them, but he just didn’t want to say the truth to my face, and any compliments were just lies/consolation cause he’s probably desperate would rather go after me than have nobody.
