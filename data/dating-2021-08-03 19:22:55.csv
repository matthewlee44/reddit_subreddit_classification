So I don’t know if I should ask her if she still wants to make it work and if not I understand and no hard feelings or just end it myself but on a positive note and explain why?, I’m just trying to prevent an awkward situation for us and our mutual friends.

1,oxgx2x,1628037159,Follow up after meeting girl at a party,"I 'm pretty inexperienced when it comes to dating etc but I went to a party at the weekend and got talking to this woman. She seemed pretty interested in me and spent quite a lot of time talking to me one on one in last few hours. She was also quite touchy feely with me. I found her very attractive and enjoyed talking to her but she was pretty drunk so I didn't really think too much of it . Anyway after I got home at 3:00 am I got a text from her basically saying she enjoyed spending time with me and asking if I would be up for going out sometime (I didn't give her my number so she's must of asked someone at the party). I responded pretty quickly to say I'd definitely be up for meeting sometime. Anyway fast forward to the day after neither of us made contact. I did request her on facebook and she accepted after 6 hours haha. Anyway I'm basically getting the vibe she's no longer interested now she's sober. I'm just wondering what is a good way to check if she's still interesting in meeting up sometime without coming across as pushy? I expect I'll be ghosted but want to shoot my shot so at least I know where she stands. Side question, how common is it that a woman is attracted to someone when she's drunk but has zero interest when she's sober.

2,oxgy33,1628037249,How do I tell my Girlfriend I don’t want to talk to her that much.,"Ok so it’s basically what it sounds like...I(17M) am dating my girlfriend(18) and she wants to talk all the time. I am more of a person who likes to spend quality time with a person but her love language is words of affirmation. She wants to talk all the time, gets upset when I don’t call her everyday, and will hardly let me go to bed when I want to because she wants to talk all night. She had even said that she wants us to fall asleep on FaceTime, but I just don’t get the appeal to it and personally think it’s a stupid idea and concept. I don’t hate that she is this way but it does get pretty annoying sometimes. She gets genuinely hurt whenever I can’t talk to her and genuinely hurt when I have to go.

4,oxh2kp,1628037687,Is this for real? There is a FaceBook page where girls post a screenshot of guys to see if the guy is cheating or not.,"**TLDR:** Went out a date with someone. Told her I was not seeing anyone when asked. She found my picture (screenshot from the dating app) on a Facebook page where girls post a pic of guys so that girls can check with other girls to ensure that the guy is not cheating.

\----------------------------------------------------------------

Last night, I went on a date with someone. She asked me whether I was dating or seeing anyone. I said no - I was not seeing/dating anyone. The things is that I would always let the other person know just to be transparent and to be on the same page if I am chatting with someone or went out for a couple of dates etc.

That night, she called me and told me that there was a FaceBook page where girls post a picture of guys and asking questions along the line 'if anyone is seeing/dating this person.' She said the page was for watching each girl's back to make sure the guy is not cheating.

She said she saw my picture (the screenshot of pics from my dating app, according to her) on that FB page, and the poster asked if someone was seeing me. Funny thing is that I have no idea how and WHY my picture was posted since I am not evening seeing or dating anyone. She was upset because she told me I did not tell her the truth.

I asked if she had taken a screenshot. After all, I wanted to see it for myself because I couldn't believe what she was saying; someone took a screenshot of me on the app and posted it online. She did not take the screenshot because the admin took it down due to the violation of privacy. She became even more upset because I was not trusting what she was saying and what she saw. 

I told her the truth and there was practically zero reason for me to hide anything. Why would I? No matter how many times I said it, she did not believe me. The discussion got stuck in a loop; she said she saw it and I had no idea and wasn't seeing anyone. It got so bad to the point where I wish I had someone I was dating so that I can just get it over with. But I would never do that because it would be a lie.

I've been in the online dating scene for some time but did not realize this is how low it has gotten; girls feel so insure that they form this page or whatever the hell it is where they post a picture or whatever the information it is about a guy (presumably with no consent) to ensure that the guy is not cheating.

I hope the person who did it is reading this and realize what you did is not nice at all.

I am just totally baffled by this. It is insane, and creepy.

6,oxh6ru,1628038093,Buying my first dog with my boyfriend: splitting the costs?,"Hey there! I would like to hear your opinion about this since it’s my first time having a dog as a pet and also sorta being co-owners with my boyfriend. 

We’ve been together (I’m 24) for 2 years and also lived together in my apartment (I’ve been living in the apartment for 5 years). We split the rent and when we eat out, he pays and the next time I pay. Now I’ve been wanting a dog for years and I felt like this is the right timing to get one. My boyfriend also wanted a dog, not necessarily the breed I’m getting but he’s fine with it and willing to put in the work. I just graduated from university and since the dog is a purebred dog that was tested for all kinds of problems small dogs can have, the price is quite expensive. As a graduation present, my mom agreed to pay 1/3 the price of the dog+items needed. My boyfriend would pay 1/3 and I would pay 1/3 so we can split the costs. Not necessarily to prove that we are co-owners but just because it seemed fair to split the costs. Since we live together we will also take care of the dog together, but the dog will be registered on my name because until now I have been contacting the breeder and such. And also because I was the one that really wanted a bichon frise. 

My mom asked me what I’m going to do if I break up with my boyfriend. I said, well the dog is mine and if I have to, I will pay him back the money he paid for the dog. The next day, my mom said that she wanted to pay 1/2 of the total price and my boyfriend doesn’t have to pay the 1/3 anymore because she thought that it would be less of a hassle that if we break up, I don’t have to give back the money to him if we pay for everything (me and my mom). Which I understand, but since we live together, it’s only natural that he will still be the owner (not officially tho) even though he did not pay. 

This reasoning of my mom is probably because of my ex. He was my first boyfriend and we were together for 5 years and we broke up in a pretty messed up way. In addition, he borrowed 2000$ from my mom to buy a car, my mom thought it would be okay because we have been together for so long, he will pay it back anyway. But we broke up before he could pay it back. For 3 months we haven’t heard from him and we thought we lost the 2000$. My mom let it slide because it was such a hassle but of course she was not happy with the situation. One day he suddenly visited my parents and gave it back in cash. It’s not entirely the same situation with the dog, since if we do break up, I am the one that has to pay him back. But I think my mom is just looking out for me and wants to avoid future hassle. I said to my boyfriend, okay maybe you can pay for the items (totaling over 700$) and not a part of the price of the dog. We will be using the items together, because you’re also the owner and the dog will also stay at your moms place sometimes. Later I changed my mind and I said, you know whether you pay 700 or 1000, it’s fine. We live together and the dog will get attached to you too which means you’re also the owner. Even though not officially on paper. 

My boyfriend told the situation to his mom and his mom wasn’t very happy with my mom’s reasoning (which I also kinda understand). She said, if you’re not going to be the owner then why bother paying anything at all. 

Now I’m wondering… is it better for me to just pay EVERYTHING for the dog, even though my boyfriend and I live together and will take care of the dog together? Or is it reasonable to ask him to pay a part of the total price? I’m sorry the story has gotten so long lol, but it’s my first time getting a dog with a boyfriend, so it’s kinda unfamiliar territory for me.

We were friends for 2 years, silently pining after each other until we decided to take the leap of faith. Next month will be 2 years since we started dating. I’m an introvert. I truly didn’t know what living was until him. I tried new things, explored new places, met new people and fell madly in love. I could’ve done those things on my own. But with him, life is technicolour. 

He’ll be leaving to Canada in January. Our time zones will have a difference of 6 hours. I saw him fail to fight the tears today when I said I’ll miss him. I’m the cry baby but I knew I needed to let him have this release. He’s been the strong one. 

I always thought breaking up was the logical thing to do instead of an LDR. But I never thought I’d ever like someone this much. I would do this for no other person but him. I’m sad and I’m terrified but I’m so damn proud of him. He deserves this. He’s loved by friends, family, coworkers and just anyone he’s come across. He’s brilliant and he’s going places.

We know we’ll fight and have misunderstandings. And we’ll take out our frustration on one another from time to time. And miscommunicate because things don’t always translate well virtually.  2 years together has taught us this.

16,oxhq0b,1628039880,Oversharing / Keeping Things Light,"I'm a (29m) guy with zero real experience and have only really started dating in the past year. It's hasn't lead anywhere but has been a super beneficial practice growth-wise as I'm learning all sorts of swell stuff about my attachment style, what I want out of a relationship and what I can provide to one. 

I've got some baggage and I think one of the things that has lead to me having a dating life is taking ownership of it and being super emotionally available and vulnerable off the bat. Talking about inner child work, self care, the hardest parts of your life and how you got through it, usually on the first date if it's a good one. 

I've been finding I have this tendency to try to steer conversations in this direction. It feels unfair and it is. I'm not really getting to know them but am just exhausting some shit I've kept bottled up a lot - proving to myself that I can talk about certain things with women I'm interested in as a 'first step'. 

My lack of relationship experience is one thing and my family's baggage with mental illness and my parents toxic marriage is another. And I usually lay out the latter way before the former (I still haven't figured out how to talk lightly about it). 

I'm conflicted because I don't want to keep things from someone; I don't want to be performative, the whole point is if I can be truly and authentically myself in front of the person and not fall into the 'try to be a kind of guy she'd wanna sleep with' mental trap. I also feel like I can be pretty overwhelming in terms of sharing my trauma but that's just because I enjoy so much talking about personal growth and how I've gotten myself to a much better relationship with myself. 

Anyways. I neither want to scare women away nor attract partners who'd be into my baggage for the wrong ~broken baby bird to fix~ reasons. 

I'm just looking for advice on how to keep things light. What are the best ""deep chats"" you've had on first dates that weren't necessarily emotionally draining?

She was never really keen on mentioning him or talking about him at all with me. She would mention him to other coworkers but not me. Eventually I found out about him and met him. For some time now, we have been working same days and same shifts. We used to not really text eachother or communicate outside of work. Now she added me on social media and sometimes reaches out on insta. We also started texting more compared to before. The text conversations are mostly banter with a bunch of gifs.

Her and I tend to get pretty flirty at work and she started breaking the touch barrier herself by playfully touching me: holding my hand to put something into it or trying to pin something on my clothes or playfuly trying to take something from me by holding my hand and etc. I would playfully return the favor. During the days when we would have a new girl working or another single girl near me, she would seemingly get jealous. She would constantly interrupt us or stand next to us and listen.

Every girl I have liked or considered dating either played with my feelings or didnt even try to give me a chance because I ""wasnt her type"" Let's be honest the reason why some girls are single is because they dont take chances that are given to them. For example: A guy who is actually nice to them, loves them not just for her looks but her personality. The girl is looking for a relationship and there is an opportunity to get in one, but what do they do? They curve the dude. I'm not saying you need to date every person that is kind to you but I'm just saying you would be more likely to be in a relationship if you just started giving people chances you dont need to like them at first sight just give them a little bit attraction can be developed.

I'm 5'4 and for some reason, I always get the best interactions and convos with women that are usually above average/tall usually 5'6+. A lot of women shorter than me like tall guys and express their liking for them. I've noticed that tallish women don't express this as much or they just dont seem to care about it. Basically not obsessing about it. A lot of women that I talk to in that range never even mention my height at all and i'm surprised because I would think that it would be a dealbreaker. So my question is, as a woman that is usually leaning toward the taller side for a woman, do you like short guys? Is it a dealbreaker. I've seen so many incredibly attractive women taller than me, but I dont know if they usually care that much about height. I usually get the vibe they dont which is strange and usually get that vibe from women shorter than me. I've seen a few short guys commenting around this sub and other places they date and marry tall women so I dont think its too rare?

41,oxkykn,1628051395,I am honestly sooooo extremely confused right now. Does she like me or not?!,"So about 3 months ago I met this girl online. We had great conversation over Snapchat and hung out about a week later. The date went well, we had a few drinks and went over to her workplace to get some dessert and I even met a few of her coworkers/friends. After I dropped her off at her house we agreed to see each other again. Though on this date I found out that she works full time graveyard shifts and when she’s not at work she’s usually babysitting her 2 year old sister.


After this date things got spotty. For a couple of weeks we kept talking but she would take hours to reply; no worries, she gets off at 7AM and usually sleeps until the afternoon! 


Though when she did reply she would usually be very dry. 


I tested the waters throughout this time and asked her to hang out a couple of times; to which she agreed to but both times she bailed on me with no warning. I usually would’ve just assumed she didn’t like me and was too nice to say no or was scared I would turn into those mean psycho dudes my female friends tell me about.


But during this time; she reached out to me and asked to hang out twice. I agreed, but again she bailed with no warning twice. 


I stopped reaching out completely and so did she. Though 3 weeks ago I had surgery and was on heavy meds post op which had me feeling brave. I reached out and asked why she would always bail and why she seemed to lose interest after our first date? 


She was pretty responsive and told me that she would be excited when we would plan the date but when the time came she would just be too tired from work and babysitting. She also mentioned that I never told her if I was looking for a relationship or not. But regardless she was in a weird place at the moment.


I let her know I was looking for a relationship but I completely understood and if she was ever looking to date, to reach out to me because I would love to get to know her better.


But we kept talking after this. 


A few days later she asked me on a date while I was at work! 


And she bailed again. But she texted me that night saying she fell asleep but wanted to know if she could come over to my house and hang out. She ended up falling asleep in my bed and we just slept next next to each other.


After this we were once again having great conversations over snapchat and we hung out a few more times. Each time we hung out, she slept over. We cuddled and made out but no sex, mainly due to my surgery. 


The last time we hung out we planned/booked a weekend trip. She even gave me the money for her flight and for the hotel. 

Though 6 days ago we were snapping back and forth like usual and she suddenly stopped opening my snaps. I sent her a few more that day and nothing. Same thing with the next day. 


I left her alone until this morning when I sent her another snap. 10 hours later and she still hasn’t opened it or the ones from 6 days ago.


And this whole time she’s been posting on her Snapchat story almost daily…


What the heck is going on right now? Did she suddenly decide she doesn’t like me and doesn’t care about losing the money she gave me for the trip??

44,oxlg24,1628053284,Dear men of “Dating Advice” today I gathered with my male and female friends and we discussed some of the things that could help improve our way of communicating with women or perhaps date the woman you like.,"Now, I’m by no means a dating professional whatsoever and the things I’ll cite aren’t universal as every woman is different. A couple of days ago I made a post mainly focused on the OLD issues men face. I wasn’t as thorough, so I thought that since today I was going to hang out with many men and women I know well that I think are very very mature, I could gather a lot of information that at least one person can benefit from. The red flags and tips they mentioned are mainly tailored to the generation between 18-30 generally speaking when trying to get someone online. Some will sound stupid to someone, some won’t. Women, please correct in anything you think isn’t as I’ll cite but I’m just going to repeat what they told me. (They won’t be in order)

1- Overly responsive too early in the getting to know each other stage. I know this one will confuse many but, the way the explained most of these things had a psychological reasoning behind it and it made sense to me. They said that if they are getting to know a guy and if let’s say they take 30 minutes to respond as they’re doing something and the man always takes 1 second to respond, it makes them subconsciously think that the man either doesn’t have many options or not much going on. I see where they’re coming from. As harsh as it will sound, most women wouldn’t want a man that they think nobody else wants (same for most men tbh). Over responsiveness does make one feel that he’s either too into you/desperate and it is too early or that he isn’t doing much. Both aren’t attractive things. I know most say that they don’t like to play the field but until a relationship is established there usually is a lot of back and forth to keep the person intrigued and eager to know more about each other. Ladies, if you’d like to add to this or correct me, please do.

2-Oversharing too early. This is one that all agreed with. Talking about your exes, family issues, insecurities… within the first couple of dates is a major red flag for both men and women but this is geared to the guys, so yeah. We all have insecurities, financial stress of some sort and problems. You don’t want to scare your potential partner away for not managing to filter and be selective with the information. I’m a firm believer that before relationships, It’s like selling (I love sales analogies). You don’t call someone and tell them pros and cons about what you’re selling from the get go. The goal is to portray the best possible image of yourself. Not lying obviously and you can share some info but hold your tongue a little and don’t get carried away. It is a global red flag and it doesn’t benefit you.

3- This one usually happens online. Too many compliments. The whole “you’re gorgeous” “I can’t understand how you’re single” business needs to go out of the window. Nobody wants to date a fan. Over complimenting makes the person seem like that. In some occasions the woman might have had interest in you but your approach made you seem like you couldn’t believe how she’s giving you the time of the day. The average lady in 2021 specially in OLD has bare dudes saying that, it will instantly put you in the ignored box 8 times out of 10.

4- Hygiene. Sounds basic right? Turns out it isn’t. It isn’t the first time I hear this one but it turns out that many dudes don’t look after themselves appropriately and I never thought I’d have to add it to the list but maintaining very goood levels of hygiene is one off those things that are a must. I met a few women who told me that they broke up with their partners because they just. couldn’t stand it anymore after trying to help them change their habits. 

5- This one is more of a tip and many will certainly not like it. Guys, be interested but don’t make it too obvious. I understand that sometimes you really feel a connection and the person might take a while to respond, you start  getting thoughts and thinking that she might be talking to someone else, you double text her, maybe call... Patience is a virtue. If she’s truly interested she’ll respond. If she isn’t, don’t waste your time. If you don’t like how she communicates and there’s no compatibility on that department, say it and keep going your way. I too have made that mistake of double texting and stuff when I was younger. At some point unfortunately, when I was 16 I was psychologically played by someone I liked with tricks to get someone hooked. It isn’t a good thing to do. Awful in fact but some men and women do it and are great at it. For those wondering, the thing I’m talking about is the having a great conversation with someone, like GREAT and out of the blue not answer in like 28 hours. It makes the person start overthinking about whether they did something wrong… they always end up double texting, stressing, calling. It is manipulation and shouldn’t be done. After I lesrned the modus operandi I too did it out of spite that same year  And it indeed works but it is probably one of the modt toxic things one can do. On the other hand, they might just be busy, so chill lol.

6-Talking shit about all of your exes. If you have something negative to say about all of your exes, chances are that you too have something to do with the break up that you aren’t disclosing. If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything. They don’t need to know about your ex on the  first date or at all. If asked, feel free to say but keep. it short and neat. The ex is in the past. Focus on the present.

I had a longer list but it is 05:30 in London and I haven’t slept as a stray cat showed up in one of our bathrooms and wouldn’t leave, as you can see on my previous post, so I’ll keep it there. I’ve personally never been a fan of “playing the field” but a few years ago I found out that dating has so many psychological subconscious factors with it. Men and women are driven and feel stimulated/attracted to someone by different things. The scarcity factor is as real as it gets and it does happen in our every day lives. The more you know something is difficult to get or that not many people can get it, the more you want it. No one can deny that. Hence why limited edition things are more expensive and still have insane demand. I understand we aren’t objects and I’m by no means trying to objectify men or women but the scarcity factor applies to both. Be the man not any woman can date. If any woman can have you, no woman will want you.  We all like to feel special. Take care of yourself, your mental health, take time to build yourself up with or without help. Work on your confidence, have goals and work towards them. Take accountability and stop blaming the circumstances even though many times they’re against us. If it rains we can either moan about it or get an umbrella. No one likes a downer. Try to not find problems to the solutions. I know many haven’t had much luck in the dating space and this isn’t the list that will solve all your problems. You might find it stupid in fact but when we get many disappointments consistently, we end up unconsciously self sabotaging ourselves because we expect that negative outcome based on what happened in the past. If you struggle in the dating market and want to date, the only option is to be on point with yourself and have something going on in your life. If your life revolves around wanting to date and you aren’t accomplishing it, chances are that you’ll indeed feel bad. Try to stay positive, and busy, get uncomfortable doing things you don’t normally do, you never know what might find there. Stay blessed.

52,oxm46u,1628056086,Why is it so hard to get over someone you’ve never even dated?,"

I met a guy about 2 years ago through a mutual friend, whilst I was on vacation. I don’t usually feel attracted to guys immediately upon meeting them, but he just had this cheeky grin which made me melt inside. Our mutual friend made no secret of trying to set us up with each other, so it was kind of awkward from the start. We would be in the same group of friends or same room and not even speak to each other, but I still felt acutely aware of his presence. He was outgoing and charismatic towards everyone but me – as soon as I entered the conversation he would go quiet (as would I). I honestly don’t know whether he was interested or not, but as I was leaving, he hugged me goodbye.

I headed home from vacation and added him on Instagram because I just couldn’t resist, and he followed me back about 5 minutes later.

Fast forward to a year later, and I’m back in his hometown for another summer vacation. We reconnected through our mutual friend, and as she was working late nights, he offered to drive me around town. While it was still awkward around other people, when we were alone in the car we had the best and easiest conversations I’ve ever had with someone. It was like we just clicked and totally understood each other’s way of thinking. He asked me if I had a boyfriend and I said no, but the conversation never headed any further in that direction.

I don’t why these small encounters had such an effect on me but I just can’t stop thinking that we had a connection, even though nothing was ever spoken. In the meantime, I’ve dated another guy (we only recently broke up) and my nagging feelings for this guy still never fully went away.

Now I’m moving to his hometown (purely by chance) and I know we’re going to cross paths again – I don’t know if there is a chance it could develop into something but I’ll be so disappointed if he’s not interested in me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oxm46u/why_is_it_so_hard_to_get_over_someone_youve_never/

I do think however that it can easily be abused by asking someone on a date and then not showing up or ghosting them but in that case I think a fitting punishment would be one night in jail + you must bow down and say your sorry to the person (whether they forgive you is up to them) and if they want they are no owed  8 hours from you because the cost of 4 hours is also lost opportunity cost.

I've tried Hinge at the suggestion of a local friend but no luck so far.  I've tried a few other apps/sites but they all rely so heavily on photos and short answers that I really feel like I can't put my best foot forward.

80,oxqn34,1628076348,Reflections on Rejection,"I’m writing this in the wake of rejection. I don’t want to be melodramatic, I’m not finding myself spurned at every turn, but it has happened a few times now and I would like to reflect on the sensations that it elicits in me. 

Before I continue, I would like to caveat everything that follows with the fact that I am a middle-class white man who has enjoyed every privilege in life. I know that what I’m writing is trite at best and offensively self-absorbed at worst, but doing this helps me somehow.

I think that dating has the potential to be a fantastically character-building experience. If you’re anything like me, you experience life as a series of mild (occasionally more extreme) peaks and troughs. So far in life, I’ve been very lucky to have kept largely to gentle rolling hills, my range of emotional experience being safely truncated at either side. What is interesting to me is how my self-image changes with this emotional landscape, and how turbulent it can be, even in the good times.

What is self-image? For me, the best way of describing it is literally how I see myself when I look in the mirror. In periods of emotional pain or rejection (however mild or inconsequential the perceived source is) I find that I see myself as less. Less attractive, less popular, less competent. In moments like these, I have a strange, and perhaps not incorrect view, that my mother might be the only person who would truly care if I were to disappear.

Although this might sound like a horrible experience, it feels more like coming to terms with a difficult, but benign truth. Perhaps periods of inflated self-esteem are times in my life when I (subconsciously) choose to see myself in the way that those people who love me the most see me. The emotional equivalent of basing my physical self-perception on a curated set of Instagram photos. I know that there are holes in this analogy: surely those that love you are the ones that see you as your most authentic self? It’s a fair point, but I am describing a feeling more than a rational argument.

I want to recognise the fragility of my ego. By acknowledging that at any given point in time my self-perception is unreasonably strongly influenced by my most recent interactions, successes, and failures, I take a step towards a more stable, aggregated personal narrative. That is one where I have strengths and weaknesses, and am neither as hopeless as my most recent failure nor as dazzling as my most recent success.

What is my point? I started this by talking about dating and how good it could be for self-development. One week someone that you like doesn’t want to see you anymore. Another, you are in the driving seat, telling a relative stranger that you think you’re better off as friends. Speaking for myself, solipsism can lead me to breeze lightly over the hurt that I may have caused this stranger, focusing instead on the inadequacy I felt when I was the recipient of rejection. Over time, both scenarios will likely play out. Perhaps one more than another, but if we weight them both equally, we arrive at the conclusion that we are just another human. Humans fail to connect sometimes. Sometimes we are the dirt on someone else’s shoe, and other times we are adored for traits that we only loosely embody. On balance, we are people capable of love. Capable of polishing each others’ self-image until it shines, until we actually start to live up to it.

85,oxrhfp,1628079613,Attracted but not sure whether to pursue...,"I (25M) have a coworker (23F) who started working with me at the beginning of the year. From the very start she's been very friendly and open but I never got the sense she was romantically interested and that was fine. I knew she was single but given that I typically don't date coworkers and the fact that she didn't openly display any interest meant that I never thought of trying to make anything happen. After she had confided a few stories in me while working late together a few months in, I asked her if she wanted come grab a drink with me not thinking anything of it - she initially accepted but then said something else had come up and declined. Though it wasn't my intent, from her answer it was clear that she felt I had asked her out and given that she canceled without making an attempt to reschedule I decided that I absolutely would not attempt to pursue anything.

Since then we have continued to get closer as friends (I say this because I want to make clear I really only ever thought of her as such), both helping each other through rough patches. Recently she decided she wanted to move to another company, so I was able to connect her to a few contacts and help get her an interview which was ultimately successful. Since knowing that she would be leaving, she's recently dialed up the flirting to the point where it's very clear she's interested and to where coworkers are consistently coming up to me asking if we're together.

Here's my dilemma. I'm at a point in my life where I'm lucky enough to get a good amount of attention from women. Most of the time I'm just not interested or there's a deal-breaker (we're actively coworkers/ different stages of life / red flags etc.) and so it's easier for me to turn down. As with everyone else, there are also people that I find attractive with whom I never seriously consider pursuing anything for the same reasons. In this case, though, I find myself in a situation I haven't really faced before: someone who has previously turned me down, who I'm attracted to but have only ever considered a platonic friend and with who I'm not totally sure we have a ton in common, and with who I'm now not sure whether to reciprocate or frankly back wayyy off. It was easy talking to her when I knew where I stood but now that I have no idea what I want to and knowing there's a bit of a time deadline (with her moving about an hour away for her new position) for me to really make up my mind it has me really not knowing what to do.

90,oxrt04,1628080755,Took a big leap of faith and it has worked out. Part 2,"So I had the date today with H And oh my god was it great, I got to know her quite a lot more and felt comfortable being myself, I think we were both quite nervous the whole time but that is to be expected.  
Well I guess I could start at the beging we met up at this nice outdoor bar place that has a lot of hanging greenery, quite a nice setting to begin with, then as you do on a date that goes well we had a decent amount of chatting to silence ratio, Not too much silence to make it awkward but enought to think about what to say next, It turned out that we had a decent amount in common as well as enough differences to keep it interesting.

We end up leaving this bar to go for a walk and end up deciding to wander towards where I stored my gear for the day (I rode into town on my motorcycle), I stored my gear at a meuseum so had to get my stuff before it closed, we ended up spending a bit of time there before it closed, and that was nice.

Then we finished the day by waiting for her bus and end up discussing how we wanted to go forward, We both wanted to see eachother again, there is deffinatly a spark, a slience washes over us as we are sitting there and I ask how much time I have left, She can see what im thinking, and she sais that she can see what I'm thinking but doesen't want to say it, so I just say would you like to, and so the moment you have probably been waiting for our lips touch in what I can confidently say will be the first of many moments we have shared so close. 

Overall it was a wonderful day and I am pleased to say we are going on another date next week, I feel this relationship has a lot of passion behind it and am quite confident it can last",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oxrt04/took_a_big_leap_of_faith_and_it_has_worked_out/
91,oxru2y,1628080856,"Selling yourself is the name of the game thanks to media, Reddit, Trump, others","Like most people, I sell my best version while dating, just as I do when applying for jobs. I've faced some racist/sexist comments over the years in both dating and while seeking employment. The most recent was from a recruiter in Georgia asking, ""how my English got so good"" (I'm half Indian and Dominican) to which I just respond ""uh, I grew up here in America and got a degree here)

Before that I was asked, ""Are you a Jehovah's witnesses"" (at a fairly well known health company by an Executive during the first interview)..  

These type of questions become more prevalent when I'm dating someone as dates will ask personal questions to get to know me. But a lot of people just have no clue how to respectfully exchange with others. I feel it should be obvious to those seeking to hire me, but apparently geographical location and surrounding culture affect an employer's ability to understand that we're not on a freaking date, and even then saying certain things can be considered offensive. 

Personally I will always go for the glass is half full. I guarantee a lot of daters and companies alike wouldn't pull half this crap out there if they're the one living in a foreign country.

I just read a thread about an Asian guy venting out all the racist encounters he's had while dating. The thread got locked down quickly since so many people had similar experiences and started sharing how they too were called ""pretty good, for an [insert country here]""...

I get Reddit does not want to propagate anything which paints people with broad strokes, rightfully so. I wish someone can tell that to my ex who constantly used gaslighting terms like, ""you always"" and ""you never"". 

Let's be honest here Reddit, is it fair to lump all voters together (or anyone who disagrees with you or is of different culture)? What about just people sharing their racist dating experiences? Some people could use a reminder about how ""racist laws"" existed and had to be taken down..

As a bi-racial person (two or more races), I try to be sensitive and understand there are nuances to everything and everyone, especially in dating. I also try to understand there are some independents out there who don't default to drinking the cool aid. But apparently no matter where you are, you still have to sell yourself.. or at the very least, rant by the rules!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oxru2y/selling_yourself_is_the_name_of_the_game_thanks/

94,oxrzbi,1628081364,Healthier eating / avoiding restaurant food on first dates,"Hi everyone. I just started seeing multiple people at the same time using several dating apps. It's fun to do on the side. Of course because I'm seeing multiple people, I can end up doing multiple first dates. My first dates are chill low commitment activities, my go to is getting food at a restaurant and going for a walk after

However, I value being healthy (and saving money), which is why I never go to restaurants on my own, I only go for the social experience / dates.

Any suggestions for good first date ideas that don't involve restaurant food?

Furthermore, when ordering at a restaurant, any suggestions for healthier food? I usually order salads (main course portion), but now I'm thinking of eating prior to the date and ordering just a side salad.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oxrzbi/healthier_eating_avoiding_restaurant_food_on/

97,oxspwg,1628083818,Takeaways from 99 unsuccessful matches/dates/crushes,"Disclosure: I'll prob get my heart ripped out again lol

TL:DR: The 100th has me smiling wide and was worth all the bullshit.

**Dating sucks**. Dating these days *really* sucks. It's tiring, demeaning, distracting, and almost holistically unsuccessful for people like me (who care). However...

It's a numbers game, and one you *shouldn't* pay attention to, as best you can. When I got thrown out of my 5-year relationship almost a year ago, I had to completely rebuild myself from the ground up. I really didn't know where to start, so naturally I downloaded Hinge. Prob sent 100 likes before anyone I thought was attractive came through my inbox. The next 7 months proceeded to be a whirlwind of emotions, unsuccessful dates, unreciprocated feelings from matches and organic connections alike, and the emotional death of a hopeless romantic. 

I quit dating cold turkey for a couple of months in late spring. No apps, no effort, and thus, no time spent dwelling girls that didn't text me back. Guess what happened: My days brightened, my self-confidence soared to levels unseen, and I actually started to ***enjoy*** myself and my life. Then BOOM. Slowly I started finding myself circling the wagon on matches and crushes yet again.

At this point (late may), I felt I'd already been rejected into the ground, and that I had nothing to lose. I started being unabashedly myself, even in the earliest conversations with someone new. I learned to guard myself, keep sensitive information close to my chest (even though I feel the constant urge to tell everyone everything), and give NOBODY the benefit of the doubt. I learned to just exist.

From May until now, I've gone on more unsuccessful dates! I finally told a close girlfriend I was drawn to her the day before she went to the lake and got a BF LOL. But I wasn't that upset, I didn't dwell, and we remain best friends to date. Possibly even closer than we were before. I just kept going. 

Then came \[redacted female name\] and WOW. What a woman. And wait... You mean to tell me... She likes me? A lot? I can be myself around her and make her smile? She calls ME to hang out? We tear each other apart in bed and she wants to hear ALL OF MY MUSIC? Hahahaha what the fuck.

She was worth the wait and persistence. The point is not to go on 99 dates so you can get to the successful 100th. The point is to love yourself first, take eggs out of the dating basket, guard your feelings, and just. keep. pushing. **It's a numbers game anyway.** It's easy to feel hopeless, unattractive, unwanted, and bound for a life alone. **In my humble opinion, the single greatest strategy is to learn to love yourself first, present yourself as exactly who you are, find a way to not stare at your phone all day, and play a little hard to get (even if it feels unnatural).** 

Good things come to those who wait.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oxspwg/takeaways_from_99_unsuccessful_matchesdatescrushes/
98,oxsqvy,1628083905,Anxiety over attachment,"So it’s been a really weird month for me.  It started when I met this girl at the office I work at, and I started to feel an attraction.  Well I’m almost 23 now and I’ve never dated so naturally I was nervous, but I made a good impression and she was interested.  We went on a date which was really awesome for me and boosted my confidence, and afterwards we talked about continuing.  Unfortunately life happened to both of us so it’s been hard to see each other.  She’s been really busy with life and I started to feel nervous she wasn’t interested in seeing me rather than it just being a time problem.  Eventually my anxieties build up and I have to ask her if she still wants to see me, so she tells me it’s really not a good time and that her life needs to calm down.  Of course I respect this and have done my best to not ask for her time right now, but it’s gotten hard for me.  I still see her at work so now I feel so anxious around her, despite not feeling it so much when we went on a date a month ago. I’m not sure what’s gotten into me, but it’s completely ruining my confidence with her and the thought of her has taken over a lot of my time.  I feel like I can’t control my anxious thinking about her, probably because I’ve never experienced this with a girl before and I’ve already become attached.  I’m wondering how I can cope with this because I really want to feel confident and comfortable around her in case she still has feelings.  Besides her though, I think these thoughts have invaded all aspects of my life and it’s making it harder to enjoy what I like.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oxsqvy/anxiety_over_attachment/
