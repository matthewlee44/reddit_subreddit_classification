TL;DR at the bottom. 

A rather smitten M/27/US here. Just wanted to ask for a little bit of advice. I recently met a girl (let's call her Jane) who moved to my city, moving into my female-friend (Ann)'s house about a month ago. She's got a great personality and is a lot of fun to be around, and is very naturally pretty too. As a result, several guys in my friend group have shown an interest in her, with one guy in particular communicating this with Ann.

He was being pushy, and Ann basically made a point that Jane has only just moved here, let's let her settle in and try to get to know her before they start trying for relationships. I really liked her also, but I kept things cool and made sure I was welcoming and didn't try anything like that with her. We spent quite a few evenings together with the group, and after a month I felt some real chemistry between us, and decided to ask her if she'd join me for a countryside walk. 

She said yes, but wasn't available at the date I specified, I was a bit disappointed. However, the next day she texted me asking if I'd go out with her as she wanted to celebrate completing a course, and no one else was around. I said yes of course and met her, we had such a great night having some beers together and getting to know each other. We have tons in common and conversation flowed like wine. 

After a few beers she said she wanted to go home, but I could stop by and have a cup of tea and watch some TV. I had my arm around her and she ended up laying down with her head in my lap, it felt romantic, wholesome and natural. However, I get a lot of anxiety about these things, and I didn't want to push her by initiating a kiss on what was basically a first (unofficial) date. When I left I gave her a hug goodbye, and that was that. It felt a little awkward leaving honestly, wondering whether I maybe should have kissed her, but we were tired, a bit tipsy, and it didn't feel like the right time. 

I texted her the next day wishing her safe travels on her journey home (going home for Christmas), expressing how much I enjoyed getting to know her more, and told her I was looking forward to taking her on that country walk when she got back from Christmas. She took a few hours to reply, but eventually responded saying that she had fun too and she had got back safe. It wasn't as enthusiastic as I expected considering the chemistry we had, and whilst it was a positive message, it did make me wonder whether I had come across too strong. 

It's only been 24 hours and frustratingly, it really is dominating my thoughts. I would love to text her and ask her how things are going etc. but I think I should give her time to enjoy family time, and let her text me on her own accord. Worst case scenario she doesn't text me, and I contact her on Christmas day with festive wished. 

Do you think I am handling this the right way? I think I've been scared off by the comments of Ann at the beginning, wanting to take things slow and let her settle in to this new city and friendship group. however, another part of me sees a lot of chemistry, and I worry whether she was upset that I didn't initiate a kiss, I haven't texted her again, or that I am being too precautions. 

Any thoughts would be appreciated. I honestly haven't felt this way about a girl in years, I've only known her a short while but we have so much in common, it really is a pleasure to hang out with her and I am pretty sure she feels the same. My plan is to just leave it for a few days and see if she wants to talk, I think it's important she has time to process her thoughts and I know that I can be a little over enthusiastic with the texts etc.

 **TL;DR I met a girl who only moved to my city recently, and we had a great date. However, things have felt quiet since the date, I didn't kiss her goodnight and I wonder maybe if I should have. I'm playing things slowly to give her time, but I'm not sure if I should be more explicit such as stating we should have a ""date"" or telling her that I really like her.**",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1138804,public,self,Leaving space after a good first date,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rjj2cn/leaving_space_after_a_good_first_date/,no_ads,0,,,,,

I’m 27F never had a serious relationship. I’ve had a few situationships, but quite frankly I’ve never really gotten involved in dating as with every case I’ve always been someone’s plan B. (I.e I get breadcrumbed away, only to see they’ve become official with another girl a few weeks later), so I’ve just enjoyed living my own life happily and been very content with that. 

However, I’m now wondering if I’m just one big walking red flag? 
I find dating apps quite demoralising, there’s plenty of nice people on them, but no one that I’ve ever found like a spark with. 
I did have one person ask me “what is wrong with you?” When I told then I had been single my whole life, which just made me feel a bit like now I’m a weirdo 😔
I’ve joined plenty of clubs to pursue hobbies the last year or so, but only females ever seem to turn up to them.

- he always has money to party with his guy friends but never has money to go on a trip with me
- he doesn’t want to do anything I suggest and never makes this type of plans with me (going to the movies, to the mountains, a romantic getaway, basically anything that isn’t hanging out in a coffee shop or in a parking lot).
- whenever he mentions an upcoming trip with boys, he follows up with: I’d take you with me as well but you know it’s only boys, we can go next time (and then we don’t go)
- we see each other once a week and stay out for 1-2 hours
- changing his behaviour and actually treating me the way I want to be treated lasts for like 2 weeks
- his sexualized humor makes me uncomfortable, he even joked about my mom in that way
- “jokingly” called me stupid a few times and even after I told him to stop
- his friend had to tell him he should invite me to hang out with them sometimes since there are also girls in their friend group
- NARCISSISTIC
- I sent him a study that said how men spent xx minutes of their day looking at different women, just so we can mock it and he agreed with it. After I told him it was lame, he responded: „What do you want from me, the study showed it’s true”
- I generally don’t feel secure in a relationship, I have to hide how I feel so I don’t come off too needy or too emotional.

This is one of those posts regarding rejection. From all the signals I could interpret during the dates we were on, and also while texting, it came out of nowhere and as quite a surprise. So I need your advice on how to handle this going forward.

Backstory, I'm not the most actively dating guy, I'm 27 y/o and when I turned 22 I just got out of a six year long relationship with a girl. The relationship wasn't good I might add, should've ended a lot sooner than it did. It took a huge toll on me and for a while I just wanted to be alone. But ever since I somewhat got over her, I've been curious about dating again, not necessarily eager to, but curious. I've been a Tinder user for about four years now, but I was yet to go on a single Tinder date until I asked the girl out that made me feel the need to write this, lets call her Kim. I'm the kind of guy who wishes to meet a girl irl, and ask her out and let the rest be history. The old school kind of way. Since I'm rather shy I've only been on a handfull of dates since the breakup with my ex five years ago. The ones I've been on have been both great and pure disasters, but none of them lasted, I was mostly the one to get rejected which was fine, every time. I'm usually not the first to give up on things, and I think dating works the same for me, if there's a chance (of feelings or such) I usually like to keep trying. I've never felt the way I do right now after getting rejected after just a few dates, and that kind of scares me.

So, what happened? As I mentioned I've never asked a girl on Tinder out before. It's been more of a ""feel good about myself"" app. I've been chatting with a few girls for a bit, but never done anything other than that. So what changed? About a month ago I wrote a message to a girl that really caught my eyes. She had the looks, the interests that I value and so on. So in the first message I made a reference to one of the pictures she had, and we instantly started a great conversation that night. We spoke briefly about the common interest that I had commented on, leaving a lot for a potential future date. She took over and asked follow up questions about my interests and said she enjoyed the same and I thought, ""Wow, this is going great. She's great"". And I told her so. I said, ""I've gotta tell you, you seem great. I'd like to challenge you to a game of darts so you can show me said skills."" And the first date kinda planned itself out. I asked about meeting on friday almost a week ahead of time and she said yes.

We decided to go for a drink before going to the darts bar. The drink ended up lasting two hours and we had a great time just talking. While playing it got kind of flirtatious and we had so much fun. We were continuously talking and just enjoying ourselves. When we were done, I was fully ready to call it a night, since I've learned from past mistakes that too long of a first date might not be great. But then she was like, ""So, where do you wanna go now? Up for more drinks?"". And I happily said yes, this was going so well.

At the next place we got seated by the bar, so we sat next to each other. And we had a few great conversations. All ranging from discussing hobbies to deeper things. She told me about her dating past and somewhat of what she was looking for, and I told her about mine, followed by a bit of silence, I guess we were both a bit shy at that point. But we both said that it's alright, nothing previous matters, and continued talking. We both felt the same way which was nice. We hung out for seven hours straight, and it felt like barely two hours had gone by. I live just outside the city so I have to take a bus to get home, and when it was getting late, none of us had kept track of time, so she asked me, ""when does your last bus leave?"". And I realised it was in 15 mins, so we left the bar. I paid the tab and while i was paying she offered to pay me back right away, and when I said that it was fine she insisted on paying for the next date. Happy and a little surprised I asked, ""So there's a second date?"". To which she replied, ""yes ofcourse, we're playing tennis next time. It's time for me to kick your ass."" I happily said yes, and we went walking towards my bus. We went our seperate ways and parted with a hug, which seemed appropriate. On my way home which is roughly 40 mins, I kept thinking about how great the night had been, and I was contemplating about whether I should write *tonight* to thank her for the evening and make sure she got home safe or wait til *tomorrow* and ask about more details on the second date or wait for a bit. Keep in mind that we had been chatting every day for almost a week at this point, so texting every day seemed normal. Once I got of the bus my phone buzzed, she had sent a message. ""Thank you for a lovely evening, i had a great time. Hope you got home safe."" I was once again happy and a bit surprised, but I was happy to answer and we ended up texting for another hour, and flirted some more.

We sent a few texts back and forth during the upcoming days, and set a date for the second date, friday a week from the first date. We kept texting about things that happened during the days, it felt kind of light and fun and nothing too serious. From conversations we found a few more things that we would like to do together in the future, which felt great. We both expressed a longing for the date to come and she seemed as excited as I was.

Let's jump to the second date, the second friday in a row. We met up and went to a restaurant for dinner. We had a great time chatting and went on to the activities we had planned out for the evening. We got along better than I could've ever hoped for. There was a bit of a waiting time to be allowed into the tennis court so we sat down and talked for a while, we even missed our name in the queue so we had to reapply and wait some more. Which was fine, since we had a great time talking. While playing we flirted some more and joked around, laughed alot and it really felt special. When we were done we ended up playing some more games that allowed us to be closer to each other, we flirted, smiled and had fun. Then the place closed and we went for a drink. Once that place closed she asked me when my last bus was. And I said in about 10 min. We started walking, got a little lost in great conversations about everything and what we wanted to do the next time we met and things we were looking forward to doing together. And I ended up being too late for the bus. Luckily there's a bus that takes a bit longer, that leaves a lot later, so she said she'd wait with me, atleast for a bit. We went to a bar and sat down, once again next to each other. We basically just sat down, gave each other a few compliments and then we shared a few lovely kisses. Followed by some shy, not really awkward silence. We broke the silence and started talking again. She told me she was looking forward to seeing the things I had talked about soon, and we both said ""yeah, lets do that soon"". Followed by a few more compliments between us. We went to the bus stop and parted ways with a kiss. Once again we texted as soon as she got home. I ensured her I was ok and on my bus home and thanked her for a lovely evening. She replied, ""I had *the best* time tonight"". And we texted a bit, some more flirting but mainly thanking each other for a great time.

Later the next day I sent her a text asking her about some details for the date we had planned for monday, and she answered with a kind of short message, ""I'm not sure, lets talk more tomorrow"". I got a bad feeling from the shortness of the message, and opted for a simple answer, ""Sounds great. We'll talk more tomorrow"". And the next day I waited until after work to text her as we had done for as long as we had been texting. And before I got home I recieved a text. The text explained that she had a great time with me and that she thought I was great, but she didn't feel the right feelings to continue dating. That she had thought things through and that it was a hard thing to tell me, but she felt it had to be done.

I was really surprised and sad, but appreciated the honesty and all that. I told her so and I asked if anything was wrong, since I felt the complete opposite and especially after how things went two days earlier. And she said she understood that it came as a surprise, referring to the date too and that she realised that it came as a surprise, especially with the last date in mind, but she had no other explanation than that it was just a lack of feeling the right feelings for me. I replied with a ""thank you for your honesty, I appreciate it even if it's tough to hear. Let me know if you want to crown a champion after ending things with a draw"". Refering to the fact that we're both competetive people and we had a draw in terms of matches between us.  

Its now been two weeks, and I'm usually not this bad at handling rejection after *""just""* two dates. But the fact is that we've been texting almost every day for almost a month, and we hung out for about 16 hours over two dates, and I really enjoyed every minute of it. And I miss even just the texting now that it's quiet. I haven't been as happy as I was when we were talking in years tbh. I guess the good thing now is that i know how much I want to find someone, and that it's the next goal in life for me.

But the problem is. I have a hard time accepting that after the two great dates we had, she doesn't feel the right things. I know I do, and I'd like to think I got a good read of people at this point. Like, the dates we had definitely were something to atleast build on. I couldn't have been this off. It's not possible. The dates we were on were by far the best dates I've ever been on. The last girl I dated before this, that was even close to having this feeling around it, were ended by the girl after just two dates. She said the same thing about not feeling the right things. Then half a year later she got back to me, saying she was sorry she had lied to me. She said that it had nothing to do with feelings, on the contrary she was scared of how much she liked me, and scared that the fact that I'm allergic to cats, dogs and other pets might be an issue in the future staying with friends and family who have pets, and how that would affect the future together. I guess that stuck with me pretty hard since Kim loves cats. I told her about my allergies on the first date and asked if that would be a problem given that she had the ""catlover"" interest pinned on Tinder, and with a sad look she said, no, it's not like you don't like animals. And smiled. But I guess it's been stuck with me ever since the last girl I dated basically ended things because of allergies.

I have a hard time letting go of this one, and I'm not sure why. And I have a feeling that I just don't want to give up on. Do you have any advice? Do I let her go completely or is it ok to try to stay in touch with her even though she didn't offer friendship while ending it? Might be torture for me, and on the other hand she might not even want to, which I would respect, ofcourse. But I actually care about her alot, and I just wanna know how she's doing.

There was a lot of chemistry, and cuddling on our movie date and we started making out at the end of it etc. I graduated and am working as a freelancer, and my part time job is over Zoom so naturally I have more free time than he does as he’s getting his Masters part time and working a full time job. Although he had a lot going on, he always showed effort and wanted to spend time with me. I’m not sure but have a feeling we were both virgins that lost it to each other, towards the end of October and he would come over to have some fun and cuddle for a while before he had to go back home. I feel like his family also interfered with whatever our relationship even was, because he had to run around and do things for them or cut out evening short because his mom wants him to go grocery shopping etc. Honestly I was surprised we even saw each other as much as we did given how hectic his life is. I would check up on him and ask how he’s doing etc and show empathy for his busy life.

I was on a film gig these last three weeks and I saw him the first weekend of December, and tried to get him to go to a bar with me and my friends, of course he was busy and told me to have fun for the both of us. I know winter break was starting soon and was looking forward to spending some more time with him.

Today in the middle of December, I had a funny feeling that he was going to end things with me this morning. Because although he always has moments where he can’t really talk, and I just let him do what he has to do while I do me… my intuition was screaming at me that this wouldn’t last long. 

I texted him this morning with a simple Hey what’s up. The whole day goes by and I get a text from him at like 8pm saying:
—
Hey sorry been dealing with a lot of stuff and kinda wanna be alone right now. It’s nothing against you but I just need some time for myself to get through some some stuff. We probably won’t be seeing each other for a while and hope you can understand me 

—
I just kept is short and said:
—
Oh I’m sorry about that I understand 
—
I never fully knew how I felt about him, like if we were just like FWB or an unlabeled couple etc. I kept our relationship private because I didn’t want outside things to ruing something so nice. 

I’m confused because his text implies that he wants to see me again but can’t rn, but we would always go a couple weeks at a time without seeing each other, after having sex we started seeing each other more consistently though. He was a sweet guy and it sucks that it has to end this way. But did it actually end??

i had my first kiss freshman year of college (lol) and basically it went bad because the guy just wanted to hookup. im already super reserved around guys but i think that incident made me put my walls up even more because i don’t wanna go through that hurt again. i haven’t done anything with a guy since but the older ive gotten the more i think there’s something wrong with me. i wish i wasn’t so reserved with guys but it’s really just the way i am. i don’t think ill ever find a guy who will be patient enough for me to get comfortable. i think im just scared of getting close to guys because i don’t wanna get hurt. im someone who loves deeply and i just know a breakup would completely ruin me. 

i understand and well aware that a lot of not being able to find a bf is my fault. im always too shy to start the conversation or anything like that. im honestly trying to get better at it but at this point i don’t even have anyone interested in me. im also not a fan of dating apps and hope to meet someone organically like through mutual friends.

So my ex and i were talking again after 6 months of no contact. I dm’d him on Instagram first. He was really rude in the beginning but somehow we got back together. Yesterday he texted me politely saying he wanted us to work but it’s ‘different’ for him now, and that he wouldn’t be able to love me the same anymore and he apologised for being rude too and he said we should go on our own way. He thanked me for trying again. He texted that we can still see each other and we should grab lunch together but he deleted that message again. We spoke about two times on phone, he said that it was really hard to talk to me. 
I told him I respect his decision and hope he is happy. 
Where my confusion lies is when he said it’s different for him. If he wants us to work again, why is he giving up on me? What is so ‘different’? Is leaving someone u used to love easy for guys? Just like that? Also, why was it hard for him to talk to me? Did he hate me that much or he is still in pain that hearing from me is hard for him.

Though the messages were non flirtatious and short lived, I felt completely betrayed since the app was on his phone for awhile, so I ended up breaking up with him right then &amp; there.

I didn’t get much closure and there were some rocky points after the break up but we’re on amicable terms now, though we don’t talk to each other much. We hung out last month and he’ll swipe up on my ig stories every now and then. Orbit if you say so. 

I decided this month to download bumble since I’m on break and have nothing better to do, and lo and behold I come across his profile. What I noticed though is that on his profile, he stated that he’s looking for a relationship. 

Upon hearing this, I felt a pit in my stomach and I’ve been an emotional mess all day. I even threw up. I don’t know what’s happening with me since it’s been so long, but he was my first love and I haven’t met anyone who understands my personality like him. I’m just incredibly sad for some reason. 

I feel hopeless about my love life and utterly traumatized. What should I do? Is it normal to feel like this? I was making good progress too in feeling content with my life.

So, we met on OkCupid about 2 weeks ago. Have been talking everyday. We have a weird set-up, but it works for us. He has his own business where he helps people take care of their dogs, walks them, etc. and he likes to fill his day up as much as he can. So, he comes up to see me, since I am a night owl…

Last night we got a hotel and got a bit drunk, I asked him about his exes. He’s been in 3 serious relationships. He seemed to be pretty over 2, but with one, it stuck out. He said she was the one that got away. He said he doesn’t miss her, just the idea and that he screwed up their relationship with not taking it seriously. I asked him if he would ever get back with her aid he said no. I was drunk and stupidly said that this was the last time we should see each other. He sounded upset. Idk why I said that. I backtracked and apologized. He said I’m the first person he’s really liked in two years. And since he talked about his relationships, thought I would make it equal and say I know where he’s coming from and also have someone who got away…I pulled up my search on Facebook by accident and I was like…”oh look, you are my number one searched person” to where he pulled up his and showed I was also his most searched, but I saw where he looked up his ex. Idk what my gut is telling me. I really like him, he’s making a huge effort to make time for me and to talk to me. Should I keep seeing him?

I've been struggling to meet girlfriend material all my life. Up until 19 years old, I struggled with the image of being a nerd or geek and most girls in my ocial circle us myself saw me as nerdy. When I moved to another city and started university, I managed to build a new image and started dating sirously. I got to know new people, more women, but nothing serious. I switched between looking for a relationship and the mindset of taking what I get. I'm not a bad looking guy and I'm pretty athletic, not too confident initiating conversations, but able to hold a conversation, if it develops naturally. So I managed to get a few ONS and a fwb situation, but always struggled to build a real relationship. 

At 23 I got into a relationship. It lasted close to 4 years and looking back at it, I wish it wouldn't have been my first real relationship (I had 2 before, but both were kinda childish). Being confronted with a person I cared for so much and who loved me, was an experience I struggled to deal with. Looking back objectively I could have handled a lot of our fights a lot better and could have communicated my wants and needs in a different way.

Evaluating my long term relationship, I'm considering myself to be in a healthy mindset right now, to be able to start a new relationship while knowing what I want and communicating or solve any fights that come up.

Know I'm getting to my current struggles: after our break up I actually haven't met any potential partners naturally. I've moved to another city for an internship and lived in an apartment complex for students, young people and interns and moved back to the town I studied in. In these 2 years I tried online dating with tinder and using a local app (jodel - pretty sure it's a German thing) and only met 1 girls that sparked my interest. Me dated for around half  a year, but I didn't develop any serious emotions. We had a fwb situation and I ended things after moving. 

I'm an athlete on a semi-professional level, getting to know people through the sport, but most are living in other cities, started hanging out and doing a lot of activities in and outside with my friends and new people when I moved back and generally take part in any social event I get invited to. But meeting potential partners has been a struggle.
I'm living my life with open eyes, trying not to seem desperate, my friends know that I'm looking for a relationship (in case they want to set me up), using tinder (no other apps have a proper user base in my area) and nothing seems to work. 
I've been thinking about my past relationship and if I could recreate my luck in any way. But basically we got to know each other because she moved into the same flat I lived in before. So it was pure chance. I've considered my strengths and weaknesses in dating and came up with the following: when I spend time with people I know, acting naturally, women seem to fall for me. I had a couple situations, when women got invited by friends to house parties and went home with me after. Initiating conversations and flirting with women I don't have common friends with, hasn't been my strength in the past. I struggle to be interested in talking to them and get bored easily. 

Right now there are 2 thoughts in my mind considering my situation:

- the typical ""be yourself"": live your life. I have a hobby, go out, act naturally and while just enjoying my life the right woman will simply appear. This would definitely work towards my strengths of being able to appear attractive to women while interacting with my friends. But it never really worked in the past and I'm tired of hearing people say ""just be yourself"" or female friends asking me how my dating life is and ""how is it possible you're single""

- reaching out to women outside of my social circle: online dating doesn't work for me. I updated my profile using reviews from reddit and selecting my pics with photofeeler. But even if my profile could be improved further, I'm simply too selective while using dating apps and love interest really fast if we don't meet right away. So the only other option is cold approaching women. I'm going to be honest... I'm not feeling confident doing that. One part is me still having the unconscious self-image of being nerdy and unwanted and the other part is simply not having the opportunity in my daily life. When I'm shopping for groceries, I'm usually ignoring other people around me, have headphones on and just want to get done with it. When I'm out with friends I'm enjoying my time with them (plus bars and clubs aren't the best place to meet girlfriend material women). I'm just not the type of guy that spends time walking around in the city and feel kinda stupid when thinking about doing it with the sole purpose of looking around for women. I just don't want it to seem desperate or unnatural. 

This post is something between venting and looking for advice. Maybe there is an activity or hobby, I could try out (not just to meet women, but something that I also enjoy, so I can partake while increasing my chance to meet someone) or someone has a new thought about cold approaches I haven't considered yet.... don't know, what time expect.
