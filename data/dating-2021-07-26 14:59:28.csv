0,os742k,1627330697,Would you continue dating a person that’s talking to their Ex?,"There’s this guy I’ve been talking to since the end of May.
We hit things off immediately and really connected. Our mindsets, lifestyles, and chemistry match each other. We both are independent &amp; secure.
It was honestly really refreshing and no red flags were presented.

We weren’t officially a relationship but talked about the possibility of being serious after he got back from a month long trip. hes clarified that this wasn’t causally hooking up &amp; we hung out always without it resulting to sex/a lot of meaningful talks. 

The week before he left, the vibe changed. 
I could feel he was pulling away from me/ distant with communicating (text) based on how he normally is.

We hung out beforehand and I felt reassured because he said he would FaceTime me and his body language/our conversations showed the chemistry was still there. 

Since he left, we communicated almost everyday but there’s a major time difference. So most of our conversations have been surface leveled and short. Not sure if it was because of this but I try not to let it affect me, but still feel like our relationship changed because it continues to be platonic &amp; not as engaging or playful. 

Hes actions almost feels as if he doesn’t care to lose me which has been bothering me because I feel like things are stagnant and we never ended up FaceTiming each other. So it’s been causing me anxiety because I’m not sure if he’s feelings for me changed.

It’s almost been a month now, and he will be back in the next week. So I’m gonna know if it’s just my anxiety talking or things between us has changed. 

Of course yesterday I was creeping on social media and see hes mutuals again with his ex of 3 years/ liked a recent photo of hers. They broke up 2 years ago and it was on bad terms. 

He broke up with her because she was difficult to be with, constant fighting due to overall insecurities and was very dependent on him. Like needing constantly to text/call each other and would stay multiple days at his place even uninvited to a point he would have to ask her to leave. Fighting because she wanted him to unfollow girls on Instagram that he knew in real life, even if they had a bf. Her reasoning for this if they post something “sexy” that she didn’t want him to see that stuff on his feed. Along with going to parties together and her having a problem with him talking to another girl/issues with him hanging out with his friends over her.

Like I said, he’s independent and appears to be a genuinely loyal person. I’m sure there’s more to it. We aren’t in a relationship so it’s not my place to ask why he’s talking to her/he’s technically not doing anything wrong but not sure how i should proceed since i have a bad feeling that might be the connection to why he’s been distant/more platonic with me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/os742k/would_you_continue_dating_a_person_thats_talking/

A few months ago I came out of my previous relationship.

2,os7cgv,1627331390,Dating someone giving mixed signals,"Hey,

It’s been a month since I started seeing someone.
We hit it off really well and spent a lot of time together - we actually took a spontaneous trip for the fourth, spent weekends after that, went out on a few dinner dates/runs during the week.

Last week told me that he likes me and that he wants to date me “long term”. I told him I’d like to date him but I want to take it a little slow at labeling things since I’m pretty newly out of a serious relationship. So we’ve been hanging out and acting like a couple without having a label. 

But I’m really confused as to how he’s really feeling and what it is that he wants.

So- He’s been really quick to finish when we have sex, or will lose his hard on sometimes. I’ve been ok with it but he said that maybe he’s not the one for me and that he doesn’t want to hold me back and that he feels like he’s failing me, since he can’t give me what I want.
I took that as him saying that we should end things, so I suggested that I think it’s best if we stop seeing each other. 
I really like this guy, but I thought he was insinuating that it’s not going to work out.
Once I said we should stop hanging out like this, he told me that he doesn’t want to stop, and that he wants to date me.

I was confused as to what he was saying, since he had literally asked me to be his gf (as mentioned earlier) but also sounded like he was backing out of it.
He has introduced me to a lot of his friends already and they’re all asking me if we are “official” yet and what not.

He tells me he likes me but I can’t stop feeling like I’m getting mixed messages.

He told me that he doesn’t want to play games… but he also goes an entire day without texting/calling me. (Although the does reach out on most days.)

He knows that I’m very much into him (I don’t try to hide it)- but when it comes to texting him/talking about where this is going, I feel like there’s a lot of uncertainty. I find myself not even being able to text him bc I don’t want to be ""clingy"".

This girl and I have been talking to each other for two months and recently she asked what we are and if I’m willing to put a title on it and tell other people. I’ve already considered our hangouts the past month as dates and we’ve spent a lot of time talking and opening up to each other. The most we’ve done physically is hold hands (I would like to escalate). She likes me and I like her but I’m not sure how I would feel about calling her my girlfriend in a couple of months. I’m just not sure because I’ve never been in this situation. She seems really passionate about committing and I’m definitely reciprocating that right now. I just feel putting the boyfriend girlfriend title and having everyone know is much too serious and idk if I want to commit to that. I would rather navigate our relationship in private, so what do I do? Her past experiences are extreme red flags but I’m willing to try working past those if she actually shows she has changed. I would like to say we are dating but idk if I will feel the same way a month from now.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/os7ctv/dating_advice/

8,os7wcy,1627332993,My date tonight bailed... But I'm happy.,"A little backstory here: 

Last week, I went to a new microbrewery before a local baseball game, where I met this really nice girl. We hit it off really well, and I just so happened to have two tickets, with a buddy of mine bailing two hours before the game. I got her number after the game, and made sure she got home okay.

A couple days later I had asked her if she wanted to get sushi Monday (today) night. And she accepted. She's a super busy woman, she works as a shift supervisor, so I haven't really texted her all that much because I don't want to be annoying.

The weekend goes by, and I've been super happy, I told all my coworkers and their moms (not literally) that I *finally* had a date. It's been way too long.

Fast forward to today, I send her a good morning text, and she responds later in the day, about an hour ago, saying she has to work late. Bummer.

Now, I've had women bail on me *on the way there,* or literally an hour before I'm supposed to leave. Happened about 99% of the time.

So to get to the point of my post, I'm just super happy I met a girl who communicates, says, ""hey, I'm sorry I have to work late."" Yeah, it sucks the date is off, but just to find someone who communicates has turned my life around, I could not be happier.


TL;DR met this girl last week, hit it off nicely. Planned a date night, and texted me well in advance that she had to work late. Found a woman who actually communicates.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/os7wcy/my_date_tonight_bailed_but_im_happy/

I understand my past failures. I was too depressed and anti social during middle/high school to talk to anybody. Since I graduated I've been working construction and have no social network or time to allow me to date. I'm not a wierdo, besides the fact that I'm 100% green. 

So thats why I'm thinking it's time for colledge. I didnt want to go bc of debt fears and the field I really like being impractical. But I now have just under 20g and Ill make it work somehow.  I can pay for the first couple years of community colledge at least. I still hate the idea if spending my money on it, but I think my social life and dating life is more important at this point.

I met someone else and called off meeting with him (we weren't at the same town at the time due to Covid).

He would randomly pop every few months in my DMs but nothing happened. Fast forward to 2 months ago, we ran into each other but this time he dated someone else. In the meanntime, he broke it off with this girl and contacted me again. We started joking that we were destined to be best friends.

He asked me on a friendly ""date"" and it was great. We really clicked but nothing romantically happened. We saw each other again in a few days and it was truly wonderful although it was also just a friendly date. He always initiated this meetings.

He went out of town for 3 weeks and we agreed to meet as soon as he comes back. In the first week we were regularely texting but now I haven't heard from him in a week. I contacted him last and we had a great conversation, nothing felt off.

12,os88pw,1627333965,Sexual performance anxiety,"Never thought I would write something like this, because I never thought it would happen to me. Yet, here we are. I M(23) recently got into a relationship with someone F(19). We have hit if off fantastically, I feel safe with her, can be myself, and feel totally open with her and she says, and I believe, she feels the same.  

A short backstory on myself. I was a virgin until having sex with her. First time, yesterday actually. I waited because I wanted to find someone I felt I could be myself around. I was waiting until marriage, but I have decided to do away with that idea, I’m getting older and wasn’t wanting to wait any longer. I came to this decision before I met her, a couple months maybe, that I didn’t mind having it before marriage. I met her, got into a relationship, discussed that I was a virgin, she didn’t care, and we talked about sex, she wanted to have it, so did I, great!  

So, two nights ago, we are almost naked, fooling around, having fun. I take her clothes off, she asks to make sure if this is what I want, I say yes, I ask her in return, she says yes. I have a tendency to overthink everything so at that time, it was not a good thing for me to have that question rolling in my head and questioning if she wanted it. But I carried on, because I did want to and she said she did as well. I get naked, and the equipment malfunctions. I was hard this whole time, when we kiss I am, when I see her, most of the time I am. Now this.  Worthless. I try to get started again but by that time, I think I just started to freak out and could not carry on. I told her. She was extremely sympathetic and understanding, a wonderful person. I tell her I am angry and upset with myself, and mostly embarrassed. Never thought this would happen to me. It has been the most embarrassing moment of my life. She then starts to cry thinking she did something wrong, or I’ll leave her, I assure her she didn’t. I told her I was overthinking and got nervous. She gets me ice cream and we go to bed.   

So the next day, we spend the whole day with one another and I decided let’s try for round 2 (or actually accomplish round 1). We were both ready. We were naked, equipment wasn’t working entirely, but after throwing out all my dumb thoughts and nerves it succeeded in working. We had sex. Happened really fast, didn’t last long, it was expected. I actually make jokes we only had 1/10 of sex since it happened within 3 minutes. I think my body is acting this way because I did get really nervous, I was sweating, shaking a little, and honestly, not enjoying myself as much as I thought. It was great, because I love her and I got to share that with her, yet beyond poor performance.  

I would like to hear from people who have had experiences like this. How to help solve it? Problems it might be? How do you calm your nerves? Is this erectile dysfunction?

15,os8dre,1627334400,What’s his game? Does he want to be FWB or is he just playing me?,"Recently started hanging out with this guy. He seems like he’s into me but also seems like he’s playing some sort of head game. He’s over 30 so not sure why he’s acting so juvenile. 

He’ll text me and say “how’s your day” at 8 am but when I respond he ignores me. Or he will message me to hang out and then ghost me. Like why message me first only to ignore me..? He also texted me a couple weeks ago when he was on vacation with his family.. Seemed like he just wanted to chat.

I get that he probably is dating around (heck me too), but why blatantly waste my time? I straight up told him it is annoying when he asks me to hang out and then never replies. He said he was sorry and the last time we made plans he actually followed through. (Although I’m not gonna beg someone to hang out, just told him how I felt.)

The next day he texts me “I like hanging out with you, you’re fun to be around.” He messaged again the following day by asking how work was, only to ignore my response when I asked how his workday was.

Very mixed signals… Mostly leaning toward uninterested, but why keep me texting me first to not even respond? I wouldn’t hit up a guy I was just hooking up with randomly to ask about his day. Feels like he is playing a game but in person he is really chill, doesn’t seem calculated or like he pulls a lot of girls tbh (part of the reason I initially was into him.) 

Let me get this straight, I am not trying to pursue a serious relationship. He is the only chill guy I have hung out with in a very long time so I would regularly hook up with him if I had that option. Not sure if he hasn’t got that through his thick skull or maybe he’s just busy, maybe it’s other girls, maybe I should spell it out for him… idk.

What I do know is you don’t text someone twice a week if you’re uninterested, but you also don’t ignore people’s texts for fun, gotta have some motive. I have just as much a right as any man to a fwb without catching feelings so I am allowed to be curious about his interest in this situation. Also, yes, I could just ask him how he feels but there is such a thing as trying to play it cool. Anyone have some insight or have gone through something similar?

22,os8taf,1627335621,I don’t date people who don’t take care of their sexual health,"I have really thought about this over the years. 

It’s so important to take care of your sexual health. 
I mean this in terms of getting tested for STI/Ds

As a female I have heard from a guy friend (who gets tested) that a lot of his friends “wait” for the girl to come back saying they have something or it’s clear. 

I find that absurd as that person could never come back and tell you they are “clear” or have something or just straight up lie. 

Please take care of your sexual health, you’re not just being responsible for yourself but others. 

I personally use a condom until we are both wanting to become exclusive and fluid bond (even then it’s not guaranteed that someone could go with someone else &amp; come back to you with something or vice versa) 

With anyone I have slept with, I let them know that I am clear before, also after I get checked and let them know as well as doing a pregnancy test. 

A friend recently got diagnosed with HIV and what’s really out of order, is the person they slept with knew they had it but didn’t inform them…

Also, after watching shows like sexual health clinics, there are so many people who have never used protection and or ne we got tested! This really opened my eyes up!

I pride myself in being the person to go to for support, and being a person that keeps his promises but those qualities that I’ve provided to my relationship make me feel like it’s a duty and no longer  romantic love. 
I don’t know what to do and more so what this feeling is.

28,os9860,1627336847,He lied about having a kid. And a GF.,"I moved into a new apartment about 3months ago. I started frequenting a nearby business. After about a month of the guy who works there being very flirtatious, I asked if he had a girlfriend. He said no why? I told him I'd like to give him my # if that was OK? He said sure. So I did. He texts me not long after I left his job. We texted his whole shift that night &amp; I asked the typical get to know you questions. The important/relevant ones to this post are:
Do you have Kids? NO.  
Do you live alone or have roommates? Alone. 

Well over the next few weeks his communication was sporadic, didn't have time to get together ect. That's fine he must not be interested ....No Big Deal. I'm too old to play games &amp; chase a man.  I stopped going into his work bc I didn't want to make him feel uncomfortable. I hadn't heard from him in 3wks. I was out with some friends &amp; missed a call from him. I got home &amp; called back but no answer. This was Thursday.  Yesterday, (Sunday) I get a call from him &amp; answer. Except it wasn't him. It was a woman. She asked who is this. Confused I was like you called me who is this? She said this was her man's phone &amp; wanted to know why I'm calling him. I told her she needed to speak to him about that. I can hear him in the background &amp; she yelled at him saying you don't want to tell me who this is Well I'm gonna find out myself. She turns her attention back to me &amp; asks how I got this #. 
I said from him.
But where? 
At his job. 
Well we live together &amp;......have a 2 yr old. 
Wait? What? He's got a kid? 
Yes.
Oh wow. Yeah you really need to check your man cus he said he didn't have a girlfriend or any kids. That's pretty F'd up. 
She starts yelling at him. You lied about our son? What the hell is wrong with you. 
I didn't hang up cus well....I was being nosey now. 
He's all I never said that blah blah blah. 
She turns her attention back to me, thanks me for telling her &amp; hangs up. 

Now, I know men lie about being in a relationship.  But why lie about having a child? Like WoW. I mean it's still bad he lied about the GF but lying about your child is another level of arseholery.

32,os9qny,1627338429,Why are short women and tall men so picky in the dating scene?," 

Both groups of short women and tall men have the weirdest height preferences even from what i've seen. Short women usually below like 5'4 sometimes have a minimum height requirement of at least like 5'10, in a lot of cases even minimum 6 feet. If a guy is taller than them but they aren't ""average or above"" they are ""too short."" Reverse this with tall men. I've seen tall men say that women that are 5'6 and up are ""too tall"" because they are not ""short"" and they only like ""short"" women so they only like a certain range that is ""short"" to them even though a 5'8 woman is 8 inches shorter than a 6'4 man she is not ""short"" because she is considered a tall woman.

I've even seen tall guys literally state that they only like women under 5'4 and they actively reject women that are 5'4+ because they are literally not short by the countries standards. Oftentimes both requirements of these groups meet and then they usually gloat how much better they are than other groups respectively. Other people like short guys, average girls, tall girls and average guys aren't usually that strict about height, its usually the short women and tall guys tbh.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/os9qny/why_are_short_women_and_tall_men_so_picky_in_the/

We talked on the second date about what we want I said a relationship he said he wasn’t necessarily looking for a relationship but was open to one. We were scheduled to have our 4th date this past Friday but he said that the system for his career exam crashed and was moved to Saturday morning, asking for a rain check since he wanted to study. He expressed how disappointed he was by the change of plans and how excited he was to see me. I suggested we move the date to Saturday evening to which he agreed. Date comes on Saturday he gets there and tells me he was hungover from drinking with his friends on Friday??? But told me that his exam in the morning was long but went well. I just gave him a weird look and didn’t address it. The 4th date was good, we ended up going back to his place (30 mins away, since he came to me for this date) and had sex multiple times that night. He invited me to spend the night and I did. This was not the first time I spent the night, but this was the first time we had sex. During the date I said I didn’t know what he wanted and he said he “wants to make me happy and give me everything I want” suspicious. He’s also not a great texter, sometimes he replies within minutes, other times (more recently) 24hrs plus.

34,os9ugy,1627338734,Should I approach? Tricky situation! (My neighbours granddaughter 😂).,"She is about 20-21 y/o. I am 27 y/o.

Basically, I tried to contact my neighbours grand-daughter through her Instagram account (I wanted to wait until she came over, but she is never there). Tbh I thought fuck it, why not? I sent a DM (with my intentions) with a follow request and she declined the request (though I later came to find out she was in a relationship, when she declined). Not long after sending the DM her presence around my neighbours has increased a lot over the past 6 months.

My neighbours house is attached to mine, so we are like toe-toe. About 1 month after sending the DM she has been out on the neighbours drive standing alone a few times. The one time I caught her staring at our kitchen window with a smile on her face and she seen me (in the kitchen) and her head shot down FAST! Like she got caught. She was squatting (outside) of her car staring through the passenger window into our kitchen window. When she knew she got caught, she went back into the house.😂

And recently, I was out front mowing the lawn and to my surprise she and her grandmother pulled up on their drive. She was like 10-15 feet away from me. But had her back turned to me and she seemed a little nervous (she didn’t seem to rush away though). Just as she is waiting for her grandmother to open the house door, (I see in my peripheral) she kinda does this slow glance as me. I didn’t look at her cause I didn’t wanna look like I was staring. Then they go on in the house.

3-4 days later around 21:00, I see her standing on the drive (in the night time) for about 2-3mins glancing at my kitchen window again. I didn’t do anything because I don’t really know the reason why she was looking, impossible to tell. Then she gets in her car and pulls off and stops/waits directly outside my house staring at our house for like another 2-3 mins and she does this weird slow drive past the house whilst the person in the passenger (I think her Mother) seat looking at my house. 100% sure they couldn’t see me looking.

And another time, (on there drive) her mother was out of the car glancing at our kitchen window, whilst the ‘Crush’ is in the car and then the crush gets out and starts to take selfies.

Could anyone interpret these situations for me? And, I am not going to approach her on my neighbours drive if I don’t know she wants to be approached. I think it’s way too close to home and risky business. I want to cause she is so beautiful. But, If it wasn’t so close to home I would take the risk.

The way how I see it is, if she wanted me to approach she would have given me something more than a glance just before she goes into the front door, when I was on my front garden. But it’s the glances/staring at my house which makes me wonder… could she be shy or is just curious. And no I don’t believe she is creeped out, I sent 1 Instagram DM/follow and left it at that.

-

Would a women really expect a man to approach her without her giving some kind of invitation?

BTW, the neighbour (grandmother) is still completely friendly to me.

Also, our houses are litterly toe-toe, as soon as I go into my kitchen I can see onto my neighbours drive. So I am not going out of my way to try and look, its just hard not to when we’re so damn close.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/os9ugy/should_i_approach_tricky_situation_my_neighbours/

When I thought about it, what that says is if I only like people that liked me first, is my taste just someone that likes me? That's a pretty low bar / standard to have. At this point, you're not picking people, you're letting people pick you.

Figure out your taste, date around and figure out what turns you on and off. It's okay to have things that turn you off. It's okay to not want to be in a relationship with someone because they do X,Y, and Z.

- 29 year old male
- Slim to fit build weighing 175 lbs. 
- Accountant pursuing CPA (testing)
- strong partner potential at the firm I work at
- clean and healthy with less than 10 sexual partners
- I have my own hobbies and goals that I'm more than happy to pursue in lieu of a likeminded woman.

I usually don't have any trouble finding women to date its just they don't really want the same things I do when I find one that meets #1 and #2 below.

My requirements for a partner:
- Don't be overweight. So this isn't like I'm going to take her measurements and check the bmi scale but I don't want someone who can't take care of themselves and you usually can tell this be looking at their weight. Also, I don't find it attractive just in a physical sense.
- Don't have kids from another man. Pretty self explanatory but I don't want to take care of someone else's kids plus it is a sign of poor decision making in my view.
- want to have kids before you're 35. Mostly because I dont want young kids running around when I'm that old and the increase chances of birth defects during advanced maternal age pregnancy. Also, my main reason for wanting a woman in my life is to pursue a family.

In my experience it's only women that don't meet the first two that want the last. Or they are beyond 30 years old in which case it seems like they want someone older and more established than myself. Also, I'm sure many might change their minds but I really don't feel like wasting time on someone who doesn't change their mind.

Just so everyone knows, I'm not complaining I just want to know if y'all I'm being to harsh by saying I'll forego all the hassle of dating and marriage if I can't find these three things in a Woman as basic requirements

51,osbanm,1627343390,I've been strength training semi-consistently since September and I love how much it's helped my dating experience.,"I was pretty unhappy with my body to start 2020. I was pushing 200 pounds and it wasn't where I wanted to be. So the early portion of the pandemic was a fun challenge. I'm a social drinker, so if I couldn't be social, why drink? I went 42 days without alcohol and returned to running and got down to 180 in a hurry. I'll never forget the immediate reaction of my long distance ex when I took my shirt off- ""*holy shit, you look great*"". 

She didn't last much longer- I ended things in June 2020. After that, I had a pure vanity project- ""*once the gyms open up, i'm getting hot as shit... there's nothing else to do!"".* I was happy to drop pounds, but i wanted to put on muscle too. My state opened gym back up in September and I went to work. I had a baseline of weightlifting from half-hearted attempts in previous years, but this time I was laser focused. I honestly attribute a lot of my newfound focus to Metallica- I used to only listen to rap while working out, but I found blasting Master of Puppets to be so much funner and more effective... I've since expanded to other Big 4 albums in my rotation. 

Now- I say semi-consistent because physical therapy caused some speed bumps. I had to see a PT for a super tight scapular region in the fall that took about 6 weeks to clear up. I had more upper shoulder issues this spring that required dry needling. I'm now seeing a PT to clear up what's hopefully the last injury- a weird radial nerve. Point being- it hasn't been a straight line!

That being said, working out has been a game changer.  I'm not a sex-god by any means- the opposite in fact. I'm pretty talkative and steer conversation to benign topics so I think I fall in the friend-zone pretty easily. So if you reading this expecting a dramatic change- so far I have no tangible news to report. I'm still caught in the dating limbo. But *man...* It is so nice to be able to wear tight pants to show off my ass. To be able to wear a shirt with shorter sleeves on a date to show that I have (some) biceps. It's so nice to take a shirt off at the beach without hesitation. I put in a ton of work, and it's incredibly rewarding to have to show some fruits of my labor.  It's definitely been a confidence boost in so many little ways. And in that it's been a game changer.

I still have a lot of work to do. I want to be able to bench 225 (two plates!). I want to continue to calibrate my diet so I can have abs- which I've found to be very difficult to achieve! But I'm very proud of myself. To all the folks in here that read these r/dating posts thinking ""would it be worth my time to hit the gym? does this hackneyed advice actually hold weight?""

He’s not my usual type physically, not ugly or anything but I honestly think I would have swiped left on him on a dating app. But... he was funny, respectful, has similar views to mine on things like religion and politics and his charisma was undeniable- every time he complimented me I would lose my ability to form words lol. We spent the entire duration of the party talking and he even walked me home. We have plans to go out this weekend and I am finding myself super excited about it.

I have two concerns though. The first is the fact that I’m so fresh out of a relationship, and even though I have no regrets I don’t want to put him in a position where he’s worried about unfinished business with my ex. The second is that, even though I felt all of the things that I normally do when I want to jump someone’s bones (lol) I’m worried about whether I will still be physically attracted to him without the excitement and alcohol. I don’t consider myself a superficial person but physical attraction does matter to me; can I be physically attracted to someone I don’t objectively find all that good looking? 

I don’t know if this is something I should pursue- my heart says to give it a shot but my head says it’s a bad idea. Hoping some outside opinions can give me a little clarity.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/osbdcx/i_think_i_want_to_go_out_with_this_guy_but_im/

57,osbwi7,1627345434,Would you date someone if they required access to your passwords?,"So a friend and I were debating this one a few days ago. I would like to premise this by saying that I am a very loyal person; If I am in a relationship, I am fully committed to it, I don't cheat, and I stay away from people who try to lure me away. That being said, I would like to get some other opinions on whether or not its acceptable for your significant other to demand the passwords to your phone, computer, social media, etc. Personally, I am very uncomfortable with the idea, and I have refused to give out my passwords to girls I've dated in the past. I am a very trusting person and all, and sure, I have nothing to hide, but to me, looking through someone's private digital activity seems a bit like prying into their diary or something. I mean, if there arose a situation that needed to be cleared up, I think I would let her look at my phone, but I wouldn't give her the password; I wouldn't give her instant, on-demand access to my accounts, and I wouldn't expect anything like that in return either. Does that make sense? Let me know what you think. As it stands now, I'm inclined to continue to refuse to give away my passwords, even if I get married and become fully committed to a woman. If I give my word that I will never cheat and never go looking for another woman while I'm in a relationship, shouldn't that be enough?

62,osc6qa,1627346392,Please…don’t,"I’m not sure if this is venting or advice. Probably a combination of both. 

About five years ago I dated a man I went to school with (since we were little). After a few months, he ghosted me after getting back together with his ex girlfriend. 

Fast forward a few years and we maintained a friendship. Of course, he and his ex broke it off, and he began pursuing me, but I said no based off his previous behavior. 

Fast forward a couple more years, and we went for a hike about two months ago. For the first time, he accepted full responsibility for his actions and said he really blew it with me (duh). I have a lot to offer as a person in relationship. I am loyal, smart, successful, passionate about helping people, physically fit, and own my own business. So, after he tells me this, we talk and I tell him I would be open to pursuing furthering our friendship, but that I was not in a place where I trusted him, so sex was OFF THE TABLE for now. And that if he wanted to show me that he was serious about pursuing a relationship, this is where we’d start. 

Things seemed to be trucking along, then bam, I get an illicit photo. I did not ask for this photo, I did not send a photo, I did not say anything remotely sexual, in fact my last text was a nature photo. 

Gotta be honest, this felt like sitting in a public place and having some man shove his d!ck in my face. What is it with men that they think this is okay behavior? This guy and many other men would never walk up to me in public and pull that. 

Of course, when I point out what I had explicitly told him about the status of our relationship he tells me “it was a joke”. 

As a woman I am so sick and tired of male entitlement and then the minimization that followed. I suggested he read a book on it, which he won’t, but gheez. 

The good news is, I’m getting better at asserting boundaries. And really, I have plenty of d!ck thrown at me. How dumb does he have to be to think that would make me think, “Ohhhh baby.” 

Vent over. The advice? Don’t ever send an illicit photo unless you are asked and if you are wondering wether or not you should, just ask yourself if you’d do that in real life. If not, keep that to yourself.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/osc6qa/pleasedont/
63,osc78c,1627346444,"Ladies, if guys don't bother to put anything in their profile description, do you bother swiping right?","For the sake of argument let's say you're looking for a *potential* relationship at least and not a hookup (and this is on Match where you typically would expect fuller profiles than your typical app's ""pics &amp; prompts only"" style).

I legitimately do not understand the logic behind dudes profiles that include a few pics and the ""About me"" says ""Just ask, I'm an open book"" and nothing more. Like dude I know nothing about you and this just sounds lazy AF, so what incentive do I have to engage you in conversation where I have to do all the prompting and you've given me nothing to go on? I've got a long list of boring-looking Netflix shows in queue that sound like a better use of my time. 😂🤔

So when I see a profile with nothing at all (or a single similar comment like that), it's an automatic pass for me, but that seems to eliminate 75%+ of guy's profiles. So here it is:

65,oscaaw,1627346753,"Feeling neglected and insecure, mixed signals from Boyfriend","So I (21f) have been dating my boyfriend (21m) for around 7 months now. It's been great so far, we laugh a lot together, like the same music, humor, history, lots of common interests etc. We don't really fight, which...I'm not so sure is a good thing at this stage of a relationship, or it means we get along really well. The only time trouble arises is when I go back home (his family lives in the city, but mine are a flight away elsewhere), about a month ago he expressed this makes him feel like I'm always 'leaving him', or that he has to 'chase me', and that he wishes to get closer to me in our relationship. We did long-distance for 6 weeks at the very beginning of our relationship, and then again this summer for another 3 weeks. I've complained to him about going home because it's in the boring suburbs, but I do it for my family because my folks are older and I don't get to see them all the time. I also complain that my parents are stricter and often feel judged for my life choices, but it is something I've come to live with (one is Asian, and they r boomers lol). He, on the other hand, has much more understanding parents and doesn't understand why I would have to go home when I don't exactly want to. I get where he's coming from, and it seems like he just wants me to be happy and make my own choices, and I've assured him that it's not my intention to 'leave him', but in my family love = sacrifice, aka sometimes I gotta go home even when I'm not dying to. Now, I've been back for more than 3 weeks now, with no plans to go back home anytime soon. In the beginning, when we reunited it was great, I met his family on 4th of July and got along well with them. But since then, it feels like I've initiated 90% of the other times we have hung out (beach days, movie nights, dinners), and always have to be the one to ask him to do something. He has been busy starting a new job this month and taking an online class at our college, so I understand that he is busy - but, I also have 2 part-time jobs going on plus classes. I just feel confused, because a month ago he said he wished to be closer to me and spend lots more time together, but now that I'm back in the city, it's as though we might as well be doing long-distance anyways. I just feel confused, manipulated, hurt, and rejected. I get that he may just be busy and not have time to hang out, but it would be nice to be asked for dinner, or even just to come over and watch some tv/a basketball game, or anything really, even a quick call before bedtime. It makes me feel like he doesn't think about me / may not even like me. And I don't know whether to confront him about all of this, or whether It's just all in my head and I need to just chill out and focus on my own work (which I have as well) and stop overthinking things. I just think if you really loved someone, you'd always make time for them. Also: he's a workaholic, and quite introverted, which you wouldn't know at first because he's quite conversational, and has expressed to me that when he hangs out with other people and doesn't work, he feels guilty. But still, I don't think being a workaholic is an excuse for neglecting your loved one. We see each other about 2 times a week, whereas I've talked to my friends and they see their boyfriends around 4-5 days a week. I understand that everyone's needs in a relationship are different, but mine just aren't being met, and I'm scared he's getting cold feet, or maybe this is just how he operates in a relationship. 

Also, we're meant to go to Italy in a week and a half, and I practically had to beg him to come with me because I thought it would be fun to travel together. It took him a while to agree because he was deciding on whether he should take a semester off school, and ultimately I think decided to. But even though he agreed, he has not initiated any of the planning. My mom has been a bigger help finding plane tickets and accommodations than he has. I worry that he resents me for taking this time away from him and his work, and that he doesn't actually want to go. But I really want to just go to Italy with him and have a fun time, and show him how to relax and smell the roses type beat. Anyways, basicallyyyyyy should I just chillax and understand people in relationships get busy, orrr is there something up/should I voice my concerns?

I find it hard, too, to meet women IRL as many of the people I meet through work or through hobbies are other men (and I am straight). Tonight, though, I may have had an opportunity to meet a single woman, perhaps close to my age, but I felt I should not have approached her and did not do so. I would like to get thoughts on this, preferably from women.
So the setting is that I am out on RAGBRAI this week, which is a bicycle ride across Iowa. Many people participate in teams and so are often out in groups. But, here I am at a restaurant at the overnight town by myself (I had gone my separate ways from my group of friends for the evening) and an attractive woman came in by herself as well. She had a bicycle helmet with her, so she was clearly another cyclist. I figure the odds she was single were good based on experience with this event. But, unfortunately, she sat with her back to me at a nearby booth. That, in my mind, was what killed off any chance of getting to talk to her. Had she sat on the other side, there could have been opportunity for making eye contact and evaluating body language. But, where she was, my one and only option seemed to be to just go talk to her like a creep. I did not think that a good idea. Even if I could have moved to a different table, that would have been a bit obvious.
I don't know if she necessarily saw me when she came in, so I don't know if she intentionally sat with her back to me. And, if she did not do so intentionally, it was then unlikely that she would see me after sitting down.

I’m 19 y/o and a rising sophomore @college. I met a girl (19) at a bar last weekend and was really hitting it off with her. We even got separated at the bar cuz of the bathroom or friends and she always seemed determined to find me. For pure informational purposes, I’ll say I got to second base with her, but there really was not time for more. She seemed very happy and I felt I really made a good impression on her.

We talked a bunch over the first few days, even with her making the occasional sexually motivated reference now and then, saying that she’s excited for me to be in town again.

Over the weekend it kind of slowed down and when I told her I was gonna be in town next weekend and she gave a very dry response. She’s been responding pretty frequently, but I feel as though I did something wrong.

For reference, I’m a massive over thinker who over analyzes everything, especially w girls over Snapchat and text. 

She had just came off of a relationship but she seemed very willing to talk to me at the bar and over the last week, but I feel like (maybe) something had changed recently. 

I know it’s hard to pinpoint what (if anything) is wrong, but can anyone lead me in the right direction?

If this week comes and goes and she doesn’t mention this weekend, should I say something again?

And if we don’t hang out or meet up this weekend, should I consider it a fail?

Please, any response could be helpful.

73,osculj,1627348661,I’ve been with my bf for 5 years but every time I’m this guy I met last year I can’t stop smiling…,"Hello Reddit :-)
So I (22, F) met my bf (21, M) in high school and got together within months of knowing each other. We are complete opposites but that’s why we got along so well. He’s more of a home-body while I prefer going out whether that’s with my friends or going out for a hike at 6am. There has been times where I ask myself “How the hell are we going to stay together if he *bad quality*.” Some of those bad qualities include- telling me I smell like sweat when I never even asked him to smell me, making me feel like a moron when I ask “What?” to whatever he told me- he already knows I have bad hearing yet he’ll tell me “What don’t you understand? *repeats question*”, when we’re in the car I’ll put my music &amp; he’ll skip all the songs I like because he doesnt like that type of music, if he asks me to do something for him and I genuinely can’t he gets mad at me &amp; gives me a nasty stare, he never posted about me on Snapchat or Instagram, a couple of times he was with me when his friends would call to hang out &amp; he told them he was just busy, etc… there’s more but main point is I don’t like his responses &amp; I feel like he could care less about what I like. He also knows I love peonies &amp; flowers in general, yet he’s only gotten  me peonies one time. And I don’t want to sound like I’m entitled or anything, but as someone who’s dated a girl in the past &amp; loved spoiling her I don’t see why he can’t give me something I love. 

He has bad qualities but there are some things I love about him, he can be so affectionate &amp; gives me an abundant supplies of kisses &amp; “I love you”s, he’s never cheated or even talked with another girl, he’s always been there when I needed to rant or cry, if we get into big arguments he’ll let me have the W so we can go back to talking to each other, &amp; etc….

His best friend (23, M) even helped me secure a job at his job. Within my first year of working there I met a guy (22, F) who worked on the night crew while I worked during the morning. I thought he was cool &amp; really nice so we  added each other on snap chat and Instagram. He would compliment my posts but it was all platonic &amp; he knew I had a bf. But he was a total gent &amp; claims he doesnt flirt with Girls in relationships. One thing I didn’t care for was the fact that he loves attention and loves to flirt with single ladies. 
Eventually he moved to the morning shift &amp; I thought cool,new friend. Within weeks he’d start writing on my water cups &amp; we started hugging whenever he’d see each other or say bye. He hugs other girls too dont get me wrong but oh my lord his hugs are to die for &amp; I dont want to sound like a  weirdo but he smells amazing. He’s tall (taller that my bf by like 5 or 6 inches) so his body just absorbs yours as you hug and his arms wrap around your whole body. He also calls me pretty every so often. 

We haven’t really talked that much because I still am with my boyfriend &amp; I could never cheat on him. Because I know what that feels like and I know he’ll be heartbroken… but idk if these feels will go away . I am not the type to go for guys who “like to flirt with girls (he did say he’d only flirt with his gf if he had one) but idk why I’m overlooking that flaw.

Yesterday I couldn't hear him clearly so I asked him if he wanted to call me back when he gets home to catch up and told him bye for now. I love hearing his voice but I get super awkward. He didn't call or text but I assumed he might got busy or felt asleep or got tired and perhaps preferred to call me next day. My question is, do I call him again tomorrow normally like I do per day or wait for him to give me a call? My friend told me is rude to ask what he's up to but to me is out of genuine interest and to keep conversation flowing. I never get jealous and I trust him just like having some constant communication in place short one though not prolonged per day. I thought it's sweet to do that but what if he gets annoyed about it? So far he's been receptive about them",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/osdcdk/guys_do_you_like_it_if_your_girlfriend_calls_you/

On our third date we watched a movie at my house, but she made it clear she actually wanted to watch a movie.

On that date I did try to initiate a little kissing, but when I asked she definitely got nervous, and explained that she didn’t have a lot of dating experience. She said she wanted to but felt like she was inexperienced.

Since then we’ve cuddled and held hands and kissed goodbye and stuff, but haven’t really gone beyond that. As we progress I do want to get more physical, but I don’t want to put her in any situation where she feels uncomfortable or pressured.

I was thinking of just being clear with her before our next date and asking what her boundaries are or if she wants to be more physical and move up to making out or more.

85,osdt64,1627352071,How do you meet women at the gym when there are no women who go to the gym?,"I just joined a gym in part because I want to get more serious with my fitness but also because I was recommended to by loads of people on reddit.

I have worked out regularly and worked on my diet my whole adult life. I think that's important. I want to meet women who care about their fitness and health the same way.

So people told me to join a gym. 

What a joke. 

I joined the biggest popular gym chain in my area and went to the only location in my area. I've been going every day after work now and while I enjoy it for the more efficient workout than what I can do at home, there are no women there at all.

Every time I go there's at least 30-40 guys working out and at most 1-2 women. Half the few women that come go with their boyfriends who are always 6'3""+ massive hulking monsters.

Also, almost every single person in the gym is half a foot taller than me and weighs 50-100 lb more. 

In short, the gender ratio is 5x worse than even Tinder. And every guy is insanely tall and muscular. Where do all these giants come from? Are they all on steroids? Don't short or average height men work out too?

My conclusion: The gym is a good way to get a fast workout in and also feel extremely small. There is almost zero chance of meeting a woman at one since they don't even go.

It's perhaps not surprising. Every. Single. Thread. Where a guy is talking about trouble dating gets spammed with ""GO TO THE GYM AND GET A 6 PACK BRO!!!"" So it's probably normal only men go. I've never seen women get that advice.

Anyway, if anyone has any better ideas I'm open. This reminds me of when people said ""go to meetups"" and I went to a few and found the exact same gender ratio of at least 10 or 20 men per women.

It seems more and more if you're not tall, white, or good looking enough as a man for online dating you're dead in the water.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/osdt64/how_do_you_meet_women_at_the_gym_when_there_are/

We share a couple hobbies and both desire to improve ourselves. She recognizes and thanks me for opening up and sharing details about my life with her. Shes not afraid to take initiative, but allows and supports my lead as well. We also have similar plans for what we want in the future. She seems so ready and willing to give her love and its so refreshing and nice.

We've been talking for about a month or more, and have had 4 dates that all went very well. I enjoy talking to her and just spending time together. We've also had some great intimate moments as well. But she overweight. Shes maybe 5'7 and around 300 pounds. Other than the weight she is very pretty, and dresses well. Everything I know about her so far is just awesome, besides that. I'm not that picky with looks as long as the person looks healthy. They can still have some extra weight but this is definitely more than what I'm into. 

I like her, but I havent really felt that infatuation I normally feel with someone new, and I think it's because  with my past partners I was physically attracted to their whole body. 

Idk what to do. I was kinda just going with it just to see how I'd feel later, but I'm not really getting closer to answer. I think I need to tell her. It doesnt seem right to continue on when I might decide later that I need to feel a stronger physical attraction, and end things when they're going good. I want to know if she plans to lose it, 100 lbs less and she'd probably look great. I think I could confidently commit if I knew shes actively working on it and wants to change. I'd love to be in her corner and cheer her on for what's probably the most difficult challenge she'll ever take on. But I also dont want it to seem like I'm giving her an ultimatum.

It was not a loop route and I found myself quite a ways from my house, and it was in the middle of the afternoon and really hot out. I stopped and was walking around looking for a drinking fountain - I was right outside of a museum next to a park, and I saw a girl who worked there that had just sat down (she had just gone on break) so I went up and asked her if there were any drinking fountains around. She said she couldn't think of any, but then picked her stuff up and told me to follow her - she brought me inside to gift shop/bar area and went behind the bar and got me a glass of ice water. 

We both went back outside and she went back to her break spot and I sat down and made a phone call and drank my water. She walked past me on her way back inside after her break; I was still on the phone and we waved at each other. It was at this point when I thought to myself that she was pretty cute.

I went back inside to the bar after I finished the water to get a refill but nobody was working there, so I just sort of hung out and watched the Olympics for a bit. She was working in the gift shop, and after a while she walked past the bar and asked me if I needed a refill. While she was filling me up we talked for a minute, and I noticed her name tag and noted her name, and then she went back to the gift shop and I continued to hang out at the bar wondering what I should do. 

I ended up borrowing a pen from somebody and wrote a short message on a napkin - it was something like ""Thanks for the water! Not sure what your situation is but here's my number."" I could not find her to give it to her but there was another girl working in a different part of the gift shop, so I asked if she knew \[cute girl's name\] and if she could give the napkin to her. She gave me a knowing smirk and said she would, and then I left.

So now its two days later and I have not received any message from her. I know there's all sorts of reasons why she may not have responded, but the fact that I have no idea if she \*actually\* got my message is making it tough to stop thinking about. I know her name and where she works so I know it's possible for me to follow up, but I'm not sure if I should..

In the past 5 months or so things kind of changed a little. She suddenly added me all over social media and we started texting a lot more often and messaging more often (usually banter or light flirting) (went from 0 interaction outside of work to every week). 

At work it's usually very fun. We flirt with her. A lot of these interactions are started by her. She playfully calls me names or teases me. Sometimes she gets pretty touchy where she holds my hand or grabs my arm. 

One thing I noticed is that she gets pretty territorial or jealous when I interact with other girls who are single.  For example, if i start talking with one of them she will swoop in and interrupt or stand super close to us and listen. Once i was chatting and flirting with another girl and she sat beside us and was staring at a blank computer screen (lol). Another time I was hanging out with another girl coworker outiside of work and posted her on my snap story and she kept asking me where we met and what we did and so on.

96,osf3yp,1627356956,Why is confidence and assertiveness such an apparent requirement for men in relationships?,"It's 2021, why do I need to be confident or assertive? Why can't you be that instead? I'll let you take charge, you can wear the pants in the relationship because I'd rather be wearing shorts.  


I'll never understand this. Sure, nobody likes or admires people that let others walk over them or people that have no personal dignity or anything like that. But the 'confidence'(tm) advice that people dish out is often confused and conflated with arrogance and at the end of the day the underlying message for men continues to be ""be assertive, outgoing and charismatic"" etc, it's just buying into the same old status-quo and nothing changes or grows for the better.  


Why are men still specifically required to be confident, outgoing, assertive? It's buying into some weird caveman logic that only the strong survive, the strong are the ones who get to have partners, have kids etc It's absolutely weird.  


As a guy, I resent the expectations and standards that between the two of us I'm supposed to the more dominant, assertive and outgoing, I'm supposed to be a leader and not a follower. But you know what? I don't care for that at all, when I think about what I want in a partner, confidence doesn't even come up on my radar, I give zero shits about it. I know my worth and I'm not a doormat but I also struggle with vulnerability, insecurities, flaws because I'm a human being. Men are told daily that we can't have any of those or that they must be dealt with privately, out of sight and out of mind.  


I know my worth, I'm not going to be with someone that treats me like shit, that's confidence right? Nope, that's not enough for most of you, when you say confidence it means arrogance and conformity to socially-acceptable standards on how men should act or how they're supposed to act as opposed to accepting that men are not monolithic beings either and we all have our problems too.  


I'm frankly just fed up with the idea that I'm required to be confident. I'm not confident, I'm only human like everyone else, please stop equally putting men on pedestals as paragons of mental and emotional discipline that have mastered the ways of traditional masculinity while also adhering to modern standards of showing some emotion as opposed to none, but not too much because apparently that's still weird or creepy when men cry about anything outside of a relatives funeral",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/osf3yp/why_is_confidence_and_assertiveness_such_an/
