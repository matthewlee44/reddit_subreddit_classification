there was this one guy (the person's house who we went to right, it's his son i'm talking about) and he was the quietest one in the lot. i had a huge crush on him and whenever i tried speaking to him he would walk away, so i thought that maybe he wasn't comfortable talking to me.

we did text on fb once we were like 18 i guess and the conversation were pretty smooth but it died down sooner or later cause he wasn't that active on it as he used to be, due to excessive college work and all that stuff.

yesterday i got to know he had joined the very same company (where i am working as an intern rn) as an intern. he is working in the property management dept and i work in finance dept (both of them come under the real estate dept) of the company. both of us are 21 y/o, just that we have a 5 months age gap is all. i couldn't recognize him initially because he looked so different from how he used to look back then, and he recognized me immediately once he saw me. he told me that one day when i was late at the office, i had gone to the HR dept to give my signature and write down the time that i had reached. on that very day he was seated on the waiting couch in the same dept and he heard my voice, and the very moment he heard the manager call out my name when she was telling me it's okay and to come a lil early, he knew it was me. he wanted to say hi but he didn't because i was in a rush.

we spoke so much yesterday when i met him in his cabin. we spoke about our internships and how its going, then we spoke about our families and our future dream jobs and all the general stuff. he is a big time extrovert and im an introvert. 

so he was pretty chill and open to me yesterday about so many things. he was actually pretty shocked when i told him about the get-together we had, because he thought it was only he who remembered about it. at times i keep having this feeling of whether to pursue him or not cause of many reasons. maybe he has a gf or maybe he was being open because he is an extrovert like i said earlier or maybe because i am family friend to him. we had an event yesterday in the office, so we sat on the same table  and our one-to-one talks were endless. many of my friends told me to get to know him more and speak to him during our off work hours and get to know his secrets and stuff like that. they told me that the way things are going between us as of now is still a good start and ofc im not jumping to conclusions, just putting my thoughts out is all. i dont mind having him as a friend either because he is just an awesome guy, but i'm just kinda confused about the whole situation. i am completely myself when i am around him, like i dont feel anxious or have any kind of overthinking thoughts in my head.

So I lied to my girlfriend and she was very offended and was hurt that I lied to her. I didnt hear from her in 2 days after lying to her. To explain briefly, I was trying to lie about my job I applied for at Amazon was no longer available and she was wandering how did I find out about my job being discontinued and I panicked and was trying to explain how I I wasn’t able to get the job. 
Story wasn’t adding up to her and I admitted that I im not going to lie to her and I chose to not go for that job due to the job position being too far from me. She then asked why would lie to her and I just responded saying I panicked and I thought she would look at me stupid that I would give up that position since it paid pretty decent. I told her I was stupid for trying to lie to her because I shouldn’t lie to her if I’m dating her because I shouldn’t have anything to hide. She then was very annoyed and mad I lied to her and didn’t want to talk to me which I understand and totally deserve it for lying.
After that we didn’t talk for 2 weeks. I then texted her saying “Ok I’ve been wanting to try to let you have your space since you’re busy studying for your last exam but do you still not want to talk? I understand my mistake and why I hurt you. I’ve been thinking about that everyday and wish I never lied to you. I just can’t take the silence anymore. I care about you and seriously miss you... I miss hearing your voice, your cute laugh, your smile, our face timing we had, hugging you, kissing you, getting to do stuff with you and everything else... I really want to gain your trust again but I’m not sure if you’re interested in me at all anymore or if I ruined everything.”
She responded saying “I mean, I don’t really know what to say…I still don’t have time to handle or process our whole situation. I’m extra stressed and busy right now because I’m working now and having to study for my next exam, so I just don’t have time. I mean, I miss talking to you too and I don’t want you to be upset or anything but I just can’t deal with things right now…I have to focus on studying”
PS, she’s a pharmacy graduate who was taking her boards exams and state exam this month so that is why she is very stressed and doesn’t have time to handle this. After another week of no talking I gave in and wanted to talk and try to work it out with her. After that we finally talked.
Sadly as of 3 days ago she has ended our relationship and thought it was unhealthy for us to be continuing our relationship due to these type of situations occurring and with us well me trying to shrug it off and get over it rather then handle and fix the issue. I failed to realize that and also failed to truly listen to her which I believe killed the relationship. We both were very happy with each other for a year and we’re very happy with each-other regardless of the little few situations we had that were never handled. The worse thing about our talk was she cried right when I was about to hang up and it literally broke my heart seeing her cry. I begged her to think about it at least and to give us a chance but she didn’t know realistically if we could work. She told me she really likes me, she has feelings for me and wanted something with me but still didn’t want to continue with the relationship… What can I do other than not contact her?

&amp;#x200B;

I've noticed the past few years that women will pre-emptively avoid me - and this has been corroborated by friends of mine the same age that are clearly single (no spouse, kids, etc.). 

Stuff like this tends to occur a lot:

* I'll sit down at a table at a fast food restaurant /  coffee shop and the woman (or women) in the table next to me moves to another table, or quickly finishes her meal to leave, or positions herself so her back is facing me. 
* I'll be at the gym and sometimes women will avoid working out next to me - or if I need to work out on a piece of equipment next to them they leave (and come back later to the same piece of equipment). Yesterday I had to use the fly machine next to a girl and she would get up, move to another place in the gym and just stand there/be on here phone, then come back to her machine in between sets. 
* I'll sit at a bar (alone) next to a woman (because there are no seats left). once a seat opens up she leaves and moves to the other seat, or just leaves the bar. 

Obviously, this doesn't happen all the time, but enough where it's odd behavior that I notice. and no - I am not giving out ""subconcious signals"" that I am looking at them - I'm fairly focused on what I am doing and have just noticed since the behavior seems odd. Yes - I take a shower and its not because I smell. 

The funny thing is, when I am with someone else (especially another girl), this behavior stops

We talked/texted for several months and finally met about a year ago. Even before we met, there was a connection. Meeting solidified it. Note: we have many traits in common, some being not so great, including intimacy issues/fears. I think that’s why it took us a little while to actually meet. He pursued it which meant a lot/showed a lot about his interest. 

Well, some of my issues played out immediately after we met and I ended up cutting off all contact out of nowhere. I guess it was “ghosting.” I went into my standard mode of self destruction and acted impulsively. There was no excuse for it and I regret it. We were also intimate when we met so I’m sure that made what I did even worse. 

Over the last year, we spoke once and he was understandably cold/distant. I never apologized even though I wanted to. I felt like an idiot and froze. Anyway, even though we haven’t been talking (again, I cut all contact), we’ve stayed connected by looking at each other’s Instagram stories. Probably 1-3 times per month for the past year (we don’t follow each other by the way, so we have to essentially go out of our way to check up on each other). I know why I look: I’m still interested/want a second chance. I’m hoping his reasoning is the same.

So here’s where I thought the outcome would become more clear…

About a week ago I noticed he swiped right on me on a dating app - that means he wanted to match with me. I was SO happy. So I swiped right too and now we’re matched. I was hoping he’d send me a message, but he hasn’t yet. I also told myself I would never contact him first again and wait for him to do so. If he did, then I’d go back to our past and apologize/be transparent (I’ve done a lot of therapeutic work on myself the last year).

I ended up going out for dinner and drinks, so I had some liquid courage. I sent him a message at around 9PM last night. To break the ice, I said something light/complimentary that related to his bio. As of right now, 11AM, he hasn’t responded and I’m devastated.

I’m already convinced he’s not going to respond and I’m going to have to do some serious healing to get over him. For good. Part of me will be shocked if he doesn’t answer because of him staying connected for the last year/swiping on me first so we WOULD match??? 

I thought me messaging first might be the right thing to do since I caused the rift/it might make it easier for him to reach out to me. But now I wish I didn’t do that :( I’m so stupid. But honestly, all I want to do is say I’m sorry and have a second chance to get it right with him.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,899557,public,self,Went against my better judgement and contacted him first - UGH.

We stayed in contact ever since that, platonically for the first few years. Hitting each other up with texts sometimes but lately (and I’d say since last year maybe?) she’s been… Kinda laying it on thick here and there. She’d call me stuff like honey or sweetheart or other stuff like that often, she’s reminisce about the past and how fun we had it. I’d genuinely consider dating her again, since people do change over a certain amount of time and we were quite young but everything stayed online while we quite literally live 10 minutes away from each other. 

I’d propose to meet up - she agrees, but no date is picked. We watch shows and movies online, we talk over voice chat on Discord. Sometimes I’d support her when she calls me up crying because she goes to therapy as well.

This year she’s been acting weird though - she’d get super close, daily contact, conversations that go sexual then nothing for 2 weeks. I asked her out again, a while ago and she said she was extremely busy with uni, so it’s better if we met up during summer break. Okay, a 2 month wait, sure. School is important. But I keep seeing her hang out with others on Snapchat and now that it’s summer break, we still haven’t gone out and she’s gone quit again. 

I even confronted her a while ago about this and how she acted towards me and apparently it’s all “in a joking way” (very weird sense of humor then in that case…) and that she doesn’t wanna go further then cuddling.

All in all her behavior towards me has me fed up and annoyed. I feel a bit played like an idiot and that I’m only there to satisfy something for her, or are her comfort buddy. Also, I just feel like she doesn’t even wanna hang out if meeting up is this hard, if you really wanna you would have.

Therefore I came to the decision to completely block and remove her from every social media if nothing happens this summer, because I’m through with having my feelings played with.

I know there is a lot to talk about, where you work, what do you like, etc, and then ask about details, but the other person needs to be a partner in that conversation, and talk a lot about each topic. If they are shy, we will be over these topics in half hour.

Kinda need to vent and kinda need some advice. 
I’ve been talking to this guy for a little over a week now. We have hung out multiple times and we both express interest in each other. We haven’t been out on an official date yet but I’m not exactly sure if I want to continue to see him. For context I’m 22 unemployed, in school, with no kids. He’s 29 employed with 3 kids. I have no problem with him having kids. However  when we do hangout we spark up and chill, we’ve done this almost all of our link ups. I have paid for us to spark up every time and also pay for snacks. All last week I was fine with this because he gets paid biweekly and we just happened to meet and start hanging out on a week he didn’t get paid. So he just kept saying I got you when I get paid, I was never expecting to be paid back but I was expecting for him to start paying for things when he did get paid. He got paid Friday I didn’t see him during the weekend but I seen him last night. I had to pay for everything again, we even had to stop before he dropped me off because he was sayings he’s hungry but don’t have no money and I started to feel bad so I paid for us to eat. Earlier in the night I told him where I wanted to go out for a date and he tells me I have to wait for him to get paid again essentially another week and some day later. 
My issue is I recent left a situation where my partner couldn’t contribute financially at all and it really bothered me. So naturally this is a major red flag for me. I’m not saying he has to be rich and provide for me but I held him down till he got paid and then not even a week later after he gets paid he’s broke again and we are spending my money. I’m not sure whether I should wait it out until he gets paid again to see what he’s gonna do or if I should just continue because I like him and he’s cool hoping he’ll get his finances together soon.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,899665,public,self,Not sure if I should continue,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/okx8sv/not_sure_if_i_should_continue/,all_ads,6,dating,,,

We have a lot of interests in common, a lot of attraction, and to be honest I just felt like I could joke around and be with her in a way that I haven't been able to in so so so long. It felt super natural and really really fun. We planned our next date before the end of the date and we'll meet again this weekend. 

So far we haven't really texted because neither of us are big texters and I don't want to come on too strong, and I also want to process my emotions without too much interference. We made the plan and I want to give her space to wonder about me too and take it slow. I'm going to confirm the day before but otherwise not over do it.

I also totally did ***NOT*** expect this. I just got out of a relationship a few weeks ago that had lasted a few months. It died a slow death and I did most of my grieving in the lead up to the end. So I feel pretty much past it.

I just had planned on hopping on OLD in hopes of just finding a fun fling or something. I didn't expect to be that effected by this woman. How do I process this? Like I said I haven't been this smitten with butterflies and interest since I was basically a kid. I know that it's not necessarily an indicator of it working out or not but holy shit this is kind of an intense feeling! I feel like the ice on my heart is melting or something. I also know that I barely know her, and I'm mature enough not to act on all these feelings like an idiot.

In my gym, which is a pretty sizeable gym, there's maybe 4 or 5 women working out while 40+ guys are lifting weights around them. Of those 4 or 5 women, maybe half are working out with their boyfriends (who aren't even the most jacked guys in the room.) That should tell you something.

Do fit women prefer muscular men? No. Do fit women prefer fit men? Absolutely. There is a huge difference between being fit and being muscular. Women who are fit may be fit because they simply eat healthy, run, do yoga, have a Peloton, or do some form of a HIIT group exercise class that is far away from all the men grunting and throwing weights around. This isn't to say that fit women are not attracted to men with more muscular builds, but they certainly are attracted to trim, lean men who may run, play soccer, and other forms of activities where building muscle mass through weights isn't the primary focus. Essentially, they want a guy who does enough to stay fit, but doesn't look intimidatingly huge. 

If you go to the gym on a Thursday and Friday night, take a look around you. You may notice that the only people in the gym on these nights where typically people go out, have dates, and have plans are the big guys who are stone cold single. The type of fit women who are drawn toward those muscular guys tend to be the very small percentage of women at the gym who are equally dedicated to weightlifting (think fitness competition types), but they are few and far between. Otherwise, those guys can look forward to getting a lot of likes on dating apps by ""thicker"" women, because THOSE are the women who are attracted to muscular men.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,899831,public,self,Re: Do fit women prefer muscular men?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/okzj0p/re_do_fit_women_prefer_muscular_men/,all_ads,6,dating,,,

I had my own run-in with their policy this morning, and thought I'd share my experience in case anyone else could benefit from it.

I signed up for eHarmony's top-tier subscription plan in January — at the time, it was 6 months for 50% off, which amounted to 269.55 USD. Four days later, I talked to my now-fiancee for the first time. Needless to say, it wasn't long before I no longer had a use for the site.

I completely forgot about my profile until I got a message from my bank this morning saying that my account had been charged $718.80 from eHarmony. I initially thought this was fraud, but after doing some digging, I found this at the bottom of the email from when I had signed up in January:

""Your current Premium Membership will run until 7/14/2021 PST. To ensure that you will have uninterrupted service, your subscription is scheduled to automatically renew on 7/14/2021 PST for a 12 months plan at 718.80 USD (plus applicable sales tax), payable in 1 payment and continues on these same terms until you cancel.""

(Note: I did not get any notice from eHarmony that my subscription was set to auto-renew, other than the note at the bottom of the email from when I first signed up. According to their terms and conditions, ""WE ALWAYS COMMUNICATE RENEWAL PERIODS TO YOU, BEFORE YOU FINALIZE THE PURCHASE OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, UPON CONFIRMATION OF PURCHASE, AND IF APPLICABLE IN YOUR JURISDICTION, IN AN EMAIL REMINDER AT LEAST 30 DAYS PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE RENEWAL DATE."")

My bank told me to contact the merchant. I called eHarmony this morning, and was told that the company's terms and conditions stated that no refunds would be issued, but that I could email their customer service team and file what amounted to an appeal. I did, and got the following response a few hours later: ""Though you are not eligible for a refund per our Terms and Conditions, as a one-time courtesy, we have issued you a 50% refund for the charge in question and allowed you to use the service for the full 12 months term.""

I replied thanking them, but asking if there was any way for them to offer more of a refund, given the fact that I had no use whatsoever for the service. They responded promptly and said that ""as a one-time courtesy, we have issued you a refund in the amount of $658.90."" (I crunched some numbers and figured that the remaining fee is equal to the cost of one month of the premium service).

So, the lessons I learned today:

1. Always make sure to cancel any subscription services you aren't using, especially if they auto-renew
2. Never settle for less than what you want. You might be surprised by what you end up getting.

TLDR: I was unexpectedly charged more than $700 for an eHarmony auto-renewal after not using the service for months, which was part of the fine print when I signed up. After several phone calls and emails to the company, I was able to recover 92% of the cost.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,899845,public,self,I made the eHarmony auto-renewal mistake so you don't have to,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/okzume/i_made_the_eharmony_autorenewal_mistake_so_you/,all_ads,6,,,,

I met one guy through an online which is a language studying app. I usually ignore bunch of flirting message and I only thought about the app as my studying tool. But, One day, this guy caught my eyes without leashes. I applied visa in Europe and I needed someone who can fix my writing as well as assessing documents to the government in proper way. He commented on my post specifically which shows his class, really well-educated. I realized immidieatly he is my ideal person who own company but He has three children, having a huge age gap over 20 years old with me, It's hard to say but his wife suicide due to mental issue which makes me feel wondering his honesty for her if she might be lonely next to him....I overwhelmed and I know he never thought I am woman but I fell in love with him automatically before I knew about his background. I think he know that I love him. But never open the box. He never text me first but if I text him, he immediately reply me. but one day, I was almost broken by him because when I really need him he refused me actually. I requested to submit sponsorship by citizen and he is the eligible citizen in a country where I tried to get a visa. It was devastated to be rejected by him. Because, he knew what I want and how much I need. He understand me. It really didn't cost money at all. but your personal information will be used. But you know, you can't really find any connection to someone who met through an online. He actually made me feel to see him. Eventhough your visa deny, I don't care, but just would like to confirm if he wants to invite me like I can do for him. But I couldn't stop messaging him since I cancelled my visa. I realized I love him so deeply. But he didn't show me any same level of emotions with me, but day by day, his attitude turned out to be attached to me but it is not 💯 sure. Today, things are happening in our relationship. He said, he and his tutor are not proper relationship. He said they have a teacher and student boundary but talking to each private things. I just cracked all my hope for him some reason. I threw away my phone and tried to be calm. Soon after that moment, I ran into my phone checked him. He asked me 'Are you ok?'. I tried to hide my frustration but my tears were overflowing and I sent him very short answers and not really respond to him. I changed my profile photo of my face which means 'Be myself'. I think, It brings him to message that I will be independent from him. And I haven't received any messages from him. I thought I can disconnect him right away but It is slowly killing me and I couldn't breathe. I feel dumped and shamed too. I know I have to stop but my heart goes what it wants. I fear for losing him now. How can I do I want to talk to him?

So:

1. I have chatted with a woman number 1 for a few days, a few messages here and there during the day then when we moved onto WhatsApp, we continued the conversation but it gradually become less and less to the point that it was good if we exchanged a sentence or two during the week. We have then briefly exchanged a few voice memos and set a date in person. Since then, there is barely any communication.
2. With woman number 2, I have briefly messaged her, she replied to me after a week, then I send another message after which she have proposed to meet in person as she prefers that rather than messaging online as she's ""not often on there"", her words. So, once again, I thought well, she must be more on WhatsApp than that dating app so we switched to WhatsApp and it takes her ages to reply, basically I send her a message and it takes days to get a reply, if any.

After the both of the situations, I have stopped messaging to see what happens as well as I became very tired of it. Woman number 1 just messaged me a couple of days before the date to see if we are still going to meet up after like 5 days or a week of no communication. However, I messaged woman number 2 a few days ago to schedule location of the meet up and haven't received any reply back again. 

In both cases it looks like it takes them a long damn time to communicate or even get a reply back. As the both of the dates are approaching and to be soon, is this a really lost cause or some women are just like that ? From my previous experience is that if someone is interested in you, they will make it happen or take the lead at times but here it seems like they are not sure or just too lazy to communicate ? If it's such a case then I wonder how would they even find a time for me in the relationship itself (rolls eyes).

So I've (21F) recently accepted that I'm in to women in the past while. I've never even kissed a girl, but I have been in relationships with guys. Recently I've been questioning everything about who I am and it's been tough. I know now that I'm not straight. I've been on a couple dates with women, but it mutually didn't amount to anything.

A while back, I matched with a girl on tinder and we casually talked every day and flirted long distance for a few months. We met up once our country allowed it with covid, and met up 2 more times. I was excited because it was the first time I let myself have a real crush on a girl without denial and with less shame. The dates were flirty and touchy, but neither of us made a real move. I wanted to, and I made that clear to her after the last date; I'm very new to this (used to guys doing all of the work for me I think!) and with covid I wasn't sure what was okay and what wasn't. 

I found it hard to read her though when we were talking online in between dates. One day she'd seem flirty, and another day she'd seem friendly. Because of this I tried to flirt so she knew I was still interested but not too much, because I didn't know where she was at and didn't want to come across as too forward or creepy.

A week after we met up last, she asked to meet again and seemed really eager. We planned it more than a week in advance, but then close to it she cancelled. When I tried to reschedule she'd say she was busy. I figured that she was done after this, but she was still talking to me every day. A couple weeks later I was going to be in her area anyway so I asked one more time if she wanted to meet while I was there, or if she wasn't interested anymore to just let me know. When I said that, she told me that she's very recently been seeing someone else and didn't know how to tell me. 

I wasn't surprised, but still bummed. I apologised if I wasn't taking a hint or was too much and she assured me that wasn't the case and she apologised for not being clear with me. She asked if I wanted to still be friends and I said yeah and so did she, so we're still talking. I genuinely would like to, because we do get on well and I've been talking to her for months, but I know from dating guys that that'll most likely fizzle out on her end, which is sad too.

I'm not going to lie, I'm pretty sad about the whole thing. I feel silly for feeling sad about it though because we weren't anywhere close to anything, we hadn't even kissed. This is all new to me, and I just feel kinda embarrassed because at some point, either since she cancelled or potentially way before that, she's stopped being interested and has seen me trying to flirt or whatever and has just been polite, or worse, she might have felt awkward/uncomfortable. I feel really yucky about that.

My confidence has been rocked a bit. I can take whatever someone says to me as long as it's honest, but because of how this came out I'm doubting myself about the whole thing. Has she actually wanted to talk to me, even platonically, this whole time or has she just been ""polite""? Is she just humouring me when she says she wants to be friends now? Hopefully this isn't the case, but now I feel very unsure of myself.

I feel really stupid for being bothered by this, I am definitely just overreacting because I've been having a tough week already for unrelated reasons and I'm sure that I'll get over it quick enough. But I've never felt like this when it didn't work out with a guy.

I am 23 year old M and single. I haven’t had a relationship since I was 18, since then I might have 1-2 hookups in university and that’s it. For the last 6 months, I have been on a journey to get fit, take extra courses for my job and everything. It has been going well, I’ve lost 8 kg in the last month and a half, I got some certifications, so things did get better after graduation. Yet again, I have to admit, it does get lonely along the way. 

My question is this:
- is it a red flag when a guy hasn’t been in a relationship for more than 7 months?
- is this an age where you would rather be in a relationship and explore opportunities?

Lastly, for the women in the audience, I want to ask you for your take on this:
- if a guy walks up to you and introduces himself, says that he finds you attractive, and asks for your number, is that creepy? If yes, what is a way a guy can walk up to you and just ask you for your contact?
- and finally, when you’re in the talking stage with a guy, what is something that pushes you away, or you’re like “no, thanks”?

I’m just trying to learn at this point, because I know I’m doing something wrong. Every feedback is appreciated.

Heyy guys, I just want to know if anyone ever experienced what I’m experiencing right now.. 
I thought I was strong enough to do it but I can’t stop thinking about him. 
I accepted to do it cause I was scared to be in official relationship and maybe experiencing break ups.. 
A majority of my friends been cheated on and I just didn’t want to be in love with a person and end up betrayed like them. 
That’s also why I don’t fall in love easily. 
So I thought it was perfect cause he also didn’t wanted to be official but couldn’t ignore the high chemistry we have... and now I’m falling in love.. falling hard for this guy 

I just want to talk about it with people who also experienced it and learn more about their life lessons

We’re both senior at our company- they’re definitely into people finding love and I doubt anybody gives a shit. It’s a 150 person startup and we’ve both been there since it was like 20. My boss always playfully suggests people to date and I’m ok with that so there’s nothing THAT weird about it. 

We met at an after work event three weeks ago and she was clearly into me so I asked her out. 

We went on a casual lunch date. I texted her a few days later said Im on the fence about working together and anything happening but had fun, we should do it again. She said “same, I’m out of town for awhile (work, it’s true) but maybe when I’m back.” I asked when she gets back, no response. 

A week or so later I text her and say hey if you’re back and want to I’d love to take you to dinner. She says yes. I text her morning of to confirm and give her another out. She says she wants to. We go. She’s very dressed up, very nervous. But we have fun. 

I take her home, pull over to drop her off no intentions of going in. She just stares at me like “are you going to fucking kiss me?” So I do. 

She immediately says, can we agree that nobody at work needs to know about this? I agree and say we can talk about it if she wants. She just sits there awkwardly so I say what’re you thinking? And she says “nothing I’m just awkward” so I say that’s okay I am too. Then I more slowly kissed her again. She didn’t back away or anything but it didn’t get crazy. Then she said “haha I guess I’ll have to see you at work tomorrow” and I kiss her a third time quickly. Then she says I’ll see you tomorrow and I say bye. 

When I get home (midnight) I text her and say thanks, “tonight was fun” no response. 

The next day was the first time her and I have ever been in the office together and it was weird. But I caught a smile from her twice…. But there seemed like some avoidance from both of us. 

Anyway, I used to be a real clinger. So I’m trying to keep the crazy away. I really like this girl but I’m not going to die if it doesn’t work out, just be pretty bummed I guess. I recognize that I probably let a bit of crazy show when I kept kissing her but I don’t think it was TOO much? Idk
