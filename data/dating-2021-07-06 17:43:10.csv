0,of60oc,1625611583,What do women look for in dating sites?,"So going to almost 2 years actively being in dating sites, and in all 2 years and numerous messages which are only left on read I've only gotten 5 replies which 3 are just bots and the other 2 only said I'm not what they're looking for. 

I'm starting to feel like dating sites are just scams for men to pay and keep paying since we'll spend days messaging girls only to get no replies. Kind of starting to feel bad about myself. 

I don't know if it's just the way I try to initiate a conversation or just the way I look (kind of starting to feel i'm hideous) but I sometimes look at myself and well I'm not the ugliest nor the most attractive, I could loose some weight for improvement, I'm a nice guy, educated, good job, have a good heart and intentions, so why is it so hard to get a reply?  What do women look for on dating sites? what kind of messages attract their attention? 

&amp;#x200B;

And just for curiosity, do any guys get bombarded with messages???",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/of60oc/what_do_women_look_for_in_dating_sites/
1,of61x8,1625611693,"How much of one's own past should one dredge up, and when, exactly, should it be so dredged?","Hi, all!

Long-time lurker; first-time poster.

I am 38, a man, occasionally bearded. A couple of years ago, I stepped out of the dating pool and have remained on the sidelines ever since. There are, to my mind, plenty of good reasons for doing so. But I have reached a point where I am beginning to think that dating is, inevitably, going to be part of my future and, in any case, *ought* to be part of my future; it is something that I desire to do, both for myself and for the sake of the happiness of whoever it is that I wind up with. That said, it is difficult to know where to begin, for reasons that I will go into below.

I spent much of my twenties teaching English abroad in quite a few less-than-friendly locales. Along the way, I picked up a pretty gnarly anxiety disorder and -- along with it -- a tendency to self-medicate. (Such is the grisly fate of many a TEFL instructor.) For a long stretch of my thirties, this arrangement was manageable: I was, to all appearances, an alcoholic, but a highly functional one. I was friendly, hyper-social, productive, creative; given to drinking too much and talking too much while drunk, but never violent and seldom snarky or mean. But, needless to say, this arrangement didn't hold. Hangovers turned into acute withdrawal, which demanded further drinking to stave off death. This all came to a head right around the time the pandemic hit. I required medical treatment to help wean me from the alcohol and the benzodiazepines that had once shielded me from panic, but were now threatening to take my life.

I am, by now, a year and three months sober. I am fortunate in that drinking did not take a toll on my physical health; I am fortunate in that sobriety is easy for me. A kind of mental switch was flipped at my lowest point, and the old habits of a decade appeared to evaporate all of an instant. From that point forward, I put in the work. I spent two months in intensive outpatient treatment; I attend weekly meetings, meditate, exercise obsessively, read the Stoic philosophers, and do all of the things that one is supposed to do when threatened by a deadly disease. I do not struggle with cravings and have not come close to a relapse, though I well know that I must also remain mindful of the risk -- pride goeth before destruction and what have you.

I believe (as all of us do) that I have quite a lot to offer someone. I am en route to a Master's program and, provided that the United States does not disintegrate within the next few years (admittedly a bold assumption), I anticipate being quite happy and successful in life. But all that said: I still harbor too many doubts to mention. 

I do not any longer doubt my commitment to sobriety or my ability to remain sober, but I worry that my past will forever remain nipping at my heels. How to begin to explain my past to a future partner? How to provide her with the sort of assurances necessary to sustain a relationship, when addicts are *notorious* for backsliding, for falling back into destructive and antisocial patterns of behavior, for playing fast and loose with the truth? Even if I no longer fear these aspects of the booze-addled personality that I cobbled together over the years, how could I possibly demonstrate this to someone who, at first, will know me not at all?

In the past, I have been forthcoming with others about my struggles. For as appreciated as honesty is in some circles, it can also alienate people. Most of us have an addict in our lives, and it is natural to associate the addicts that we meet with the addict that we *know*. Needless to say, it is often a painful association, and not one that some people are willing to engage with. So I tread more cautiously these days; I tell those who wish to know, but refrain from bringing it up where I don't have to. Obviously, in a relationship, this is exactly the sort of stuff I would want to -- and need to -- share with someone.

But how to go about it? This certainly isn't first date fare. It might not even be second or third date material. But the past, no matter how grim and no matter how compromising, eventually must be shared with one's partner, because it is the past that makes us who we are. I feel that my past has strengthened me; without having flirted with death for so long, I might not have such a strong appreciation for life; I might not be so dedicated to the principles that make me a good person or, at any rate, that make me a much better person than I was before. So all of this must be shared. But I also have to assume that my background will be disqualifying for a lot of people; it will also sow distrust into whatever trust exists; but I suppose that is my question. Is this the sort of thing that people are willing to work with, or is it best to remain sequestered in my house with my cat until I've tucked more sobriety under my belt?

Thanks for any and all feedback! And cheers to all those who have struggled with addiction, or with partners who have; it is truly one of the most fearsome predators on earth, and I am lucky to have survived it. Anything else that I get out of life from this point forward is a bonus.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/of61x8/how_much_of_ones_own_past_should_one_dredge_up/

6,of6ql3,1625613946,sad story: 24(M) got dumped/discarded in the middle of uni prom by 24(F) prom date.,"i have always had a crush on this girl in class, so when college prom rolled along (my uni had a prom), i mustered up my courage to ask her to be my date. Surprisingly, she said yes!

on the evening before the prom, i spent about 2 hours and a sum of money to make myself as good looking as possible for my date. I got a new haircut and went shopping for a new shirt. I bought a new body fitting shirt which i thought looked pretty good. 

The prom started with a 3 course meal dinner. We sat down in our respective tables. Halfway through the first course my prom date dissappeared. i thought she had gone to the toilet.  

15 minutes passed and she was still not back yet. i got worried and excused myself from the table, went to look for her, thinking that she must have fainted or something. Went to the toilet, she wasn't there. texted her, no reply. 

Eventually, i came back to the table after all the course meals were already served, and then asked the girl sitting next to me (someone else's prom date) on the table whether they have seen my prom date. she looked at me with a pitiful expression and then told me that my prom date was with another guy on table no 15. 

my heart sank. it was like the worst day of high school all over again. I looked at table 15 and sure enough, she was there, with a tall, jock-looking guy who looked like he was in uni on an athletic scholarship. I saw the way she acted with him was so different towards me, she was laughing, pawing him, her hands on his lap and shoulder. later on, i heard that they had just met while she was on her way to the front of the hall to take pictures, and promptly hit it off. 

I pretended like everything was ok and put on a fake smile on my face, proceeded to eat my meal. after that, it was all i could take and i decided to go home because i felt like crying. did not want anyone to see my man tears. so i quickly made for the exit and.....ran into my prom date with her new jock date of all people!

at first, i pretended not to see them, hoping i could make a beeline for the exit as quick as possible before she saw me becasue i was so embarassed of myself. but she saw me and, probably feeling sorry for me, blurted out ""hey, where are you going?"" i blurted out in reply: ""not feeling well, going home now"". i could tell she was feeling sorry for me from her facial expression, so she whispered to me: ""i'm sorry"". then she went back to taking pictures with her new jock date. 

i felt like i had been hit by a ton of bricks when i got to my car. i stayed in my car for an entire hour crying, not just out of sadness, but out of embarassment.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/of6ql3/sad_story_24m_got_dumpeddiscarded_in_the_middle/

10,of76lk,1625615500,Breaking up with girlfriend after one month over chemistry?,"So I’ve (23M) been exclusive with this girl (21F) for a month now and we dated a bit before that, and I got this realization that there is not that much chemistry. At the beginning we clicked fairly well, we had similar interests and life goals. But as I got to know her and date her properly I’ve realized we’re quite different people. She self describes herself as a non social introvert and spends most of her time at home watching TV and I tend to be more of a social extroverted out with my friends getting drinks kind of guy.

Other wise she’s an amazing person, she’s smart as a whip and creative and beautiful. But I have this inkling feeling that although our similarities in hobbies and interests, we may not have a lot of similarities in values and compatibility.


I’ve been thinking on breaking up with her for this reason but I also don’t know if that’s also because the honeymoon phase is over and the issue is actually that I can’t accent stable companionship. I’ve seen a lot of post of people breaking up for losing the ‘spark’ and I’d hate to break off a perfectly healthy relationship because I was too caught up in my own self doubt.

I've been starting to get these episodes where I just have an intense desire for human affection. Not being too fond of relationships at the moment, even though it's a possibility, my skin hunger is going fucking nuts right now. As you can see, i'm kind of motivated to get out there in the dating market and see what's out there for me. Here's a few issues i'm working on so hopefully you guys can help out a bit!

1. I have very few friends, which has never bothered me, but I am making an effort to speak more to others. I'm not weird or anything, just very selective of who I let into my inner circle.
2. Living in Jacksonville, there are not that many great places to meet women without having to cough up a few dollars for a drink. What I mean is, I don't like to go to bars frequently, or nightclubs. Nightclubs are too expensive to even begin to speak to women. (VIP area, expensive drinks, etc.) 
3. The only women visibly interested aren't anywhere near my preference.

If I was into a girl, I would never not respond to a text. So I assume the same for her. The text didn’t have a question, but a simple “lol” or “haha” or “that’s funny” would be the bare minimum.

48,of9k5f,1625623993,Women and dating tribes. I think I am done going after the wrong ones.,"Ok so I have been on the dating game since forever and I have come to the conclusion that there are certain tribes that women belong to(and men too). I live in Canada and from my experience the traditional Canadian women on average will not accept easily a guy that looks like he does not belong to his tribe(if you're ethnic ... you don't match). Like for women attraction is mostly social and if you don't belong to her tribe ... you won't get in easily. Of course if you're hyper social and a master talker with a zillion friends, you probably will get in. But that's not me and not many people most likely lol.

Like I've recently been matching with a lot of foreign women and it's amazing how open they are. Like first they match with me then we talk and there is no bs like a banter and stuff. Of course we tease each others and have fun. But it feels so much more fluid. Also the women from my ethnicity seem to be more reserved and submissive. Like here in Canada the ladies seem to have a zillion other dudes looping around them on Instagram and I just feel like a number to them. They don't seem to be looking for anything serious too. Of course not everyone is the same but I have been on dating apps for 10 years and I'm seeing a trend here.

All that to say, I think I'm done going after the traditional Canadian lady. I think I'm going to look at foreigners.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/of9k5f/women_and_dating_tribes_i_think_i_am_done_going/
49,of9lno,1625624145,"How Much I Loved Dating, And Am Thinking I'd Love To Be A Matchmaker","Before I met my STBXW, I (52M) loved to date. 

This was in the early 1990s, before OLD, and dating for the most part was organic. But how much fun I had meeting new people and going out on dates. I worked in a nightclub and although I was not every person's type (e.g. I was not super tall or super buff or a bad boy, so to speak) I had a fresh-faced look to me that combined (working in a club plus okay looking) made it so I never had a shortage of dating opportunities. And how much I loved to date back then. I'm heterosexual (note: also a firm supporter of LGBTQ) and dated a wide range of ages and types of girls because I loved just going out, hearing their stories, and feeling that rush of getting to know someone I was attracted to\*

Then I met my STBXW, and was faithful to her for an our entire relationship so put all dating aside, but then after she ended our marriage last year I entered the dating pool again (this time utilizing OLD). What I learned is that at 52 I had not changed a bit since I was in my early 20s -- I still loved to date, still enjoyed getting to know people on an intimate level, was comfortable dating all types of women, and didn't have  issues finding people to date (OMG I love OLD). 

I had no intentions of settling down again, but then I met a magical person, and with zero reservations then or now have focused exclusively on her (53HLF). But I do miss the magic of dating, of getting to know new people on their best behavior (note: I love interviewing for jobs and interviewing potential employees for this very same reason!). 

So my point of all this is this: I'm wondering if I'd like being a matchmaker. And if people use matchmakers. And if so what their experiences were. And how they found them. And what words of wisdom any one reading this might have. What I imagine is interviewing potential men and women daters, getting to know their stories and interests/goals, then trying to find a match for them, charging a reasonable rate (and not some exorbitant fat fee that some services charge) while also providing feedback when applicable. 

My current SO, who is so kind and loving and sexual and balanced and who knows me so very well, has said I'd love being a matchmaker and that I'd be good at it. And she likes to joke that I am a human anthropologist, since I love meeting people and hearing their stories so much (I'm that person you find yourself dumping your life's story to at a coffee shop or hotel bar or on an airplane, and at the end of the conversation we part ways and you realize you dumped your story on someone without knowing who they are and realizing you'll never see them again :) ). And all of this is one of the reasons I drive Lyft/Uber on the side and I volunteer at various organizations on the weekends -- I enjoy talking to people.

Anyway, sorry for the long post. And I am very grateful for any thoughts/wisdom that you have. Maybe it's a crazy pipe dream I have, and that's okay to say, too. 

Thank you!!

52,of9noq,1625624349,Does it seem like he likes me? How can I let him down easy?,"

 I am a girl and me and my friend are both in our 20’s. I’m starting to feel that he is starting to like me. We have known each other for a couple of years but we only started hanging out recently. There was a point where we would spend hours on the phone together at night but i realized that we shouldn’t do that if we’re not in a relationship because i feel that it isn’t appropriate. After the first time we hung out he expressed that he would like to hang out more often because he enjoys my company. We hung out once more  but something that I noticed is that I don’t feel comfortable around him. I have no idea why this is though. I feel uneasy and I’m constantly thinking of things that we could talk about. I usually make up some excuse if he wants to hang out because I don’t want him to start liking me and then have that awkward conversation. I could be wrong about him liking me but he has told me that he doesn’t view dating as dating. He sees dating as hanging out with someone until someone wants the relationship to progress. So part of me started thinking that maybe he is hoping for that with our relationship? If we’re out together at church for example he would introduce me to all of the people that is important to him. He even invited me to a family party but I did not go because if they see him with a girl they’re going to assume that there’s something going on and I don’t want to give him or them the wrong idea.
Just a few more random things I want to add:
-If he expresses that he wants to hang out and I mention that I am hanging out with another friend he would say something like, “oh I thought we were going to hang out.”",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/of9noq/does_it_seem_like_he_likes_me_how_can_i_let_him/

About two days ago he shared with me that he went on a date - I have absolutely no problem with this as I have gone on dates as well. However, I’m a bit disappointed as he never expressed a desire to actually meet with me. We live quite close to one another so I can’t say that could be the reason. 

Honestly I never brought it up, however as he has always been the one pursuing me so I assumed he would at some point. So I’ve greatly reduced the amount of time I spend talking to him because I feel as though I am wasting my time. He has continued to try to talk but honestly I’m not feeling it anymore because it seems like it is going no where to me - no point in talking online all day with what seems to be no desire to meet - so I rarely respond.

Is this the wrong way to go? Should I hold out longer and see if he ever brings it up or just move on? Thanks.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/of9num/am_i_overreacting_how_do_i_manage_disappointment/
54,of9otp,1625624458,Something a therapist told me,"I was in a relationship for 7 years with a pretty great guy. 
Over time all these little moments had added up to a huge Mountain of pain and problems. 
Women and men ( in my opinion) tend to have very different roles in a relationship. When my partner and I were living together it felt like I was caring for a child. I was carrying the burden of responsibility. Everything from house chores, groceries, laundry, bills, cleaning, pet care. 
At first it wasn’t a big deal but over time I began asking for help. I communicated the weight I felt and resentment I was building in always feeling like the “adult”. 
Daily my partner would let me down. 
I would ask for help every day, beg for help. 
We decided to see a therapist because the stress was feeding into my depression and bleeding into so much of my life, even now after two years single I still feel anger and fear about being with someone for this reason. 
A therapist told us that as a women I would always carry this load. I would always be “nesting” and my counterpart would likely always need guidance. She asked if making him lists and him completing those tasks would help me and I told her no. No because it’s just ONE more fucking thing I have to do.

I refuse to catch feels, have a crush, or shoot my shot because it’s a trap waiting to happen. If I see a guy that is good looking, I’ll admit that he’s good looking. I won’t catch feelings or anything. My mom, sister, and best friend thinks I’m way over my head, but I made up my mind. I rather be single for the rest of my life. Despite having bad luck with love, I’m also feel that I don’t have what a guy is looking for. I’m not a size 2 and I don’t have a pretty face. I don’t fit the bill that a guy is looking for.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ofa9mm/forever_a_loner/

71,ofai5y,1625627442,"Is it possible to date someone who rejected me in the past, or should I just move on?","A few years ago when I was 23 (f) and he was probably around 29 (m) I think, I went on maybe 3 or 4 dates with this guy. He was already a practicing attorney and I was in my second year of law school. I really liked him and I felt like we had a good connection. He gave me really good advice on navigating through law school and encouraged me in pursuits and dreams I had that I was afraid to pursue or take risks on. I think we made each other laugh and ultimately had a good connection. But then one day he texted me and told me that he knew we hadn’t gotten to the point of talking about being exclusive or in a relationship but he was really busy with an increasing work load and other obligations and he didn’t feel like it was fair to waste my time if I wanted a relationship with him and that he had a blast spending time with me and he hoped he hadn’t hurt my feelings and he wanted to maintain some sort of friendship. I had told him that it was okay, and I understood and that I still wanted to remain friends with him.  I really appreciated his honesty with this text message, and to be honest I wasn’t really free to have a good committed relationship at that time either because I was in the worst part of school. 

&amp;#x200B;

I saw him about maybe two or three months after this happened and he came to say hi to me, but I was a little awkward because I honestly did kind of have feelings for him still but he was really kind and friendly.   

So later, I made the stupid mistake of getting into a relationship with a different guy. Maybe a year later I think I heard the first guy had a short lived girlfriend, but I’m not sure. Fast forward to around November of 2020 and the guy I was dating and I broke up. I ran into the first guy at a bar, but I was there were pandemic restrictions in place and people were supposed to stay at their own tables so i didnt say hi to him, but my sister said she kept catching him looking over at us. KK fast forward a few months and pandemic restrictions are a lifted and I run into him at a restraunt. I was exhauseted I hadn’t slept all night because of a family emergency. He came to say hi and it was kind of awkward again, but cute, and both my friends said that he seemed to be interested in me. 

Later I posted about the family emergency and he sent me a really nice message and we talked a bit about what was going on and it was sentimental and comforting. I apologized to him for not being friendly when I saw him the weekend before and explained the reason why, he said he hadn’t taken it that way. 

&amp;#x200B;

He’s been liking all my pictrues on social media and we’ve been chatting a little bit, but I dont know if its all in my head, or what is going on. Or if he is interested or I am reading to much into it. 

&amp;#x200B;

He was/is everything I’ve always wanted in a romantic partner. He is an exceptionally kind and caring person, he and I share a lot of the same values, his family seems really cool. I’ve dated other guys recently and none of them are really as special as he is, like I just realized I’ve kind of shut these other guys in a way because they just are not him. 

&amp;#x200B;

72,ofarar,1625628404,"I (23M) and a woman (18F) have serious crushes on each other, get along, seem compatible, but I’m having issues with the age gap.","We recently started working for the same company. Her cousin (my friend) casually introduced us to each other, about 4 months ago. Nothing but to introduce us as friends. She found me attractive from the get go, and I found her attractive as well, but I immediately forgot about it since she is still 18.  

Fast forward a couple months, we started to talk to each other when we see each other, it’s a big building so maybe for 20 minutes every couple days. She has expressed to her cousin how she has very strong feelings for me and I have started to like her more. She has the personality traits I look for in a girl. She’s also not a high school girl. She’s in college, works full time, provides for her own housing, is independent, and confident.  

So I’m talking to her cousin, I tell him I’m thinking about asking her out. He has given me his support and thinks it’s a good idea. He mentions to me she actually wants to ask me out. In person. Which has never happened to me before, and I find amazing.  

I’m worried about a couple issues. All revolving around the age. I don’t want to be seen as a creep. I don’t want to lose respect of friends, co workers, family.

73,ofaz40,1625629205,Crush on Coworker Who’s Last Day Is Tomorrow,"I apologize ahead of time, cause I’m venting and telling the story, post may be a little long.

So I started this job about 3 4 months ago, and when I start a new job I usually keep to myself until someone interacts with me. Fast forward to now I fit in perfectly with everybody, talk and connect well with most of my coworkers, although it’s a few that I’ve never said one word to, but that’s to be expected.

I recently got moved to another area in the warehouse where it’s this cute girl that I really wanted to get to know, but since she’s super shy and seems to have a little social anxiety, just approaching her like I normally would a girl I was interested in might have made her to nervous to talk, so I thought.

So I started simple, introducing myself, asking her how she was doing, how long she’s worked there, stuff like that. But I was usually carrying to conversations as she wasn’t giving me much to go off of, which is cool, in my mind she’s not interested so I’ll fall back, wouldn’t be the first time. But, we start playing this little eye tag game, where she’s starring when she thinks I’m not looking and I indulge, so I do the same back. We do this little game for about a week or so. So in my mind I’m like, at the very least she’s interested in what I got going on.

Now mind you, she literally only talks to her sister at our job who’s last day was Friday and that’s how I found out that her last day is tomorrow. Also my homie through me an oop, he told me today before our shift started that if I wanted it to talk to her, today and tomorrow is all I got. 

So today, again I said wassup, and these are my exact words, “hey wassup, I heard this is your last week.” She says “hey, and yea tomorrow is my last day.” I say “dang that sucks, just when I was starting to develop a little crush on you, what you got planned after this.” We talk a little more after that before we gotta get back to work. Weird and corny to tell her that, yes I know, but I wanted to see how she would react, or what she would say, I think it made her nervous a little bit, but that’s why I asked the follow up question “what you got planned after this,” to give her an out from that crush comment just in case that made her uncomfortable. After that we don’t see each other the rest of the shift and don’t get to talk.

Tomorrow her last day and I plan on telling that I wish her luck, wish we got to know each other a little bit more, but I’m rooting for her nonetheless, something along those lines. Now I know the easy thing to do is to just ask for her number but she hasn’t really gave me anything that would suggest she’d want to talk, which is why I told her I had a crush on her just to see what she should would do.

So I guess my question is for all of you, what would you have done differently from the beginning up until tomorrow, her last day.

75,ofbc0o,1625630580,"I really don't want to break this vulnerable guy I've been talking to, feeling guilty and don't know how to make it better","I've recently made an amazing friend on a mental health Discord that's been supportive to me and we've shared a lot of deep stuff chatting and also hung out on voice chat. I really value him as a person, but he's in a vulnerable place and grown over attached to me and started telling me how much he craves love from me - as someone with BPD I find this terrifying. It all feels so full-on that he talks about craving love and he wants me to fill something hollow inside him and I've told him I can't do that, and it feels like too much pressure.

I've tried to tell him that we've not even video called yet, we live far away in different countries and he's moving way too quickly with stuff but he doesn't seem to see these things as problems, provided I could have feelings for him.

 I've made it clear that I want him to expect nothing from me because I can make no promises, and we should try voice chatting and video calling more. I've told him I want to support him to grow in his confidence as a friend as he has quite low self esteem with dating, and I've told him I want to help him use dating apps and give him advice about girls. But this really upset him as he says he doesn't like or want girls from a dating app, he rarely gets matches and finds using the app really de-humanizing and depressing. He said he specifically wants me or someone like, and when I suggested the other girl he'd been talking with from the app, he got really mad and said he wasn't ok. This is upsetting me as I feel attached to him emotionally.

I've told him I want to slow things down and maybe call.  I actually feel quite scared of him right now but also guilty because when I was feeling sexually frustrated I did start talking in a sexual way with him which he liked and I feel I've led him on, which is causing me guilt. I apologised for this.

78,ofbrsf,1625632349,Ghosting is the best option in some(limited) cases.,"I see people on here saying ghosting is NEVER acceptable. Can you please stop? Dating is seriously complicated. Are there patterns? Should you apply rules that help you navigate such a complicated and crazy scene in a manner that creates the least amount of pain and destruction for all? Yes and yes…

However, I’m sure if people were to think about various scenarios, they could come up with tons of examples where ghosting made the most sense whilst being the kindest possible course of action. In the end, should you ghost someone? Generally speaking, of course not. But to say it’s NEVER appropriate, which a lot of people  on here do, is just flat out refusing to even consider the multitude of different situations and personalities across the dating spectrum.

Here’s a real world example. I went on a date. My date was 80 pounds heavier than she looked in her profile. She met me at the front door of the restaurant and says, “Well I’m never seeing you again.”.

So in this real world example, she is, flat out, telling me she expects that she will never see or hear from me again. After the date, we said our goodbyes and neither of us ever texted each other again. I have zero regrets.

Now I’m sure some of you will think, well that’s really not ghosting. Yeah, I’m not talking to you. I’m talking to the people who think, regardless of the situation, you just have to give the person your explanation.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ofbrsf/ghosting_is_the_best_option_in_somelimited_cases/

90,ofcm3i,1625635948,Hung up on a dude from the past while married,"I really need to vent. I'm probably gonna be dragued for even saying any of it but I've been keeping it bottled up for years! First of all I'm happily married with two kids and we want many more, probably 5-6. I love my husband. It's hard work being married and working on ourselves but we have really built a beautiful life and I wouldn't change a thing from the past. I grew a lot in the past few years and I owe a lot to my husband because he was there when I needed it. He's far from a saint and so am I but we love our family together!
Before I was with him I used to have a friend. We met at work, he was a customer and friend of a collegue of mine... We lost track for a bit after I stopped working there because he was in a long term relationship and I had kind of a story with that friend of ours. He was always flirting with girls even though he was in a relationship so I thought he was a player and didn't think much of him.
One day, out of the blue he reached out to me and asked me out, just as friends. Wanted to chat. So he came by and picked me up and we went out. He payed for everything even though I didn't want him to. Said he was italian and had to. Brought me back home and that was that. He wasn't with his gf anymore and I was single. Since there had been something between me and his friend I didn't think anything could happen. Bro code and all. So I really saw him as just a friend. As time went by, we kept talking. I didn't realize it back then, I don't know why, but he was actually always complimenting me. For example, he wanted to come and pick me up once and I didn't want because I wasn't wearing makeup and ready to to be. He said I was still the most beautiful girl ever or something along those lines. He always told me I was beautiful, but not in a flirty way? At least I didn't think of it that way. He talked to me almost everyday. We would go out together 2-3x a week. Usually late at night. He would pick me up, always pay... Eventually, I kinda started wondering if he would eventually make a move? But instead, he started having me meet his friends, and would always say stuff like : you would go very well with him, or this guy is probably your type, or my friend thought you were pretty, etc. Etc. Etc. He would always tell me I was like his little sister and everything. By that point I realised he didn't see me like that, and I started to keep myself from seeing him like that, too. He seemed upset about his bad breakup. He told me he cried in his shower, and that he never told stuff like that to anyone. At some point, I also realised he had no clue his friend and I went out a few times, and I told him. We kept seeing each other but it got weird, I don't know when. He brought me on a DATE once. A date with another girl! A girl he didn't really like I think but still. The first girl he had slept with since his gf. She was his standard girl, very well-groomed and toned, fit, gym everyday girl. Which I'm not! I'm a bit on the curvier side although healthy, I love running and cycling, but I don't hit the gym. That date was so weird. He said he didn't like her, and wanted my ""opinion"" on her. I mean... Do you know how hard it was to see him with her? But I was a good friend. I told him she was sweet. Which she was. Even though she hated me but I can understand. Who brings his girl pal on a date with his well.. date? We went to grab some coffees and it was sooo awkward. After that I realised he really wasn't into me. He still kept complimenting me. He still kept seeing me 2-3x a week. Always driving, always paying, even though I fought him on this. We would always text and write to each other.
But since he wasn't interested, I started going out with other guys. It had been going on for months.. so I met my ex-boyfriend and had a fling with another man, too. Nothing serious, but I told him about it. He always gave the best advices but I knew he thought I was silly. I just felt it in the way he spoke. I was, too. My ex was an asshole. Eventually, we had a falling out. We spent a bit of time without seeing each other. When we spoke again, I had met my husband. He came to my place of work at some point (worked in a sexshop where I met my husband). He said he wanted to buy some stuff for a girl he was seeing and see the new guy I was dating. Later, he told me for sure he was gay and made fun of him a bit. I got upset and so did my husband (bf then). After a while, that man and I stopped talking again. I reached out 2-3x but he either answered very basic answers of just didn't answer at all.
I didn't think about him that much after that. But some time later I found an old convo with him and it made me wonder if he might have liked me, or if I was simply foolish. When it's hard with my husband, I think of what might have been. I will never reach out to him. I'm trying to forget about him altogether, to respect my husband.
But seeing those conversations with that man... remembering our nights out together, talking for hours on end, eating fastfood in his car, driving all night long, then chatting with him online before bed... I wonder if I hadn't gone out with his friend... If I had let him the time to heal from his previous relationship.. what might have been. Maybe I just read to much into everything. But he made me feel like the most beautiful woman alive. He was always there. And I miss his friendship. It's been 7 years. He probably don't even remember me.
I just want to silence those thoughts in my head. Even if he never could have liked me. Even if I know we wouldn't have been right for each other at the time. I was too young and too stupid. I was 19 and he was 27 or 28. We were not at the same place... And now, I have children that I love more than anyone in the world and I wouldn't change a thing in my past because it would mean that they wouldn't be there. I just feel like he's the one that got away and I hope that finally saying it, even to a bunch of strangers, and not keeping it bottled up will help put it to test. I hope I forget him someday.

91,ofcryk,1625636661,Should I continue this relationship?,"So for background knowledge I have been friends with this girl for almost 3 years and 1.5 years ago I started to like her, I liked her and eventually fell in love with out her ever knowing but then we kinda lost touch for about five months and I got over her and only had a crush on her but not a lot. Then two months ago we started talking again but she and I started flirting but I was never that seriously flirting but she was and during that time only felt alittle bit of attraction. Then a month ago she came out and said she had feelings for me and at the time I still thought I had feelings for her, so we started dating and now I feel nothing most the time and even sometimes I’m repulsed by her. Is this wrong to feel? Should I just break up with her or stay alittle longer because it’s only a month in and who knows if I might start liking her again.

96,ofd72r,1625638595,Is my boyfriend starting to lose interest in me?,"We have been together for 5 months and we haven't met each other for 2 months because of COVID19. 

He rarely online during the day (sometimes he stays offline for several days) since 2 months ago. Meaning that he never text me first. I have raised this issue to him and he said that he just not the type to text and he hate seeing all the unread text from his groups. He also said that he only replies to my text. It's true, he always reply to my text but only at night. There was one time he just ignore my text and didn't text me for whole week.

He never calls me. It was always me who initiate the calls. However, when I try to end the call, he would always stop me and ask me to stay. 

His friends know about me. He post about me online and I was invited to join his group WhatsApp with his friends last month.

I just don't understand him. He rarely says romantic words but when I sulk or mad, he will say that he loves me. 

He never compliments me and always tease me (i don't really mind though but looking at his action, it starting to bother me).

He always on discord playing games with his friends. However when I ask to call me, he would leave his games and spend his time with me. Only if I ask for his time. 

Idk if I'm overly sensitive but as this is my first relationship ever, I am so confused with his treatment in this relationship.

Please give me some advice on how to handle this kind of situation. I'm sorry for my bad english as I'm not a native speaker. 

Tldr; my unemployed boyfriend of 5 months rarely text me and never calls me. Is he starting to lose interest in me?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ofd72r/is_my_boyfriend_starting_to_lose_interest_in_me/
97,ofd77j,1625638609,Should I text him ?,"(Sorry if I posted in the wrong subreddit &gt;&lt; )

 So I dated this guy  who’s leaving the country in one month (we’re both forigen students  and I accept dating him because I was leaving the county soon too) we both knew our relationship was not serious and we were just having fun. (I Didn’t sleep with him btw)

The day he left to the airport  I hugged and kissed him goodbye. Ever since that day I didn’t stop thinking about him and miss him  everyday.  Its been three months since he left.  Recently,  our conversation became dry and dies quickly.  He comments on my Instagram stories  and reacts to them sometimes but nothing more. 

I’ve been feeling so lonely these days and I keep fighting the urge to  text him because If I do I might  mess things up. I also don’t want to sound so desperate and annoying.

My friend told me i should move on and stop worshiping him lol . But I just want to keep our conversation alive. I thought maybe it’s okay if i chat with him about my new job for example or the new city recently I moved to.. 


I know I’m over reacting and making big Beal of nothing but do you think it’s okay if  I text him or just leave it ?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ofd77j/should_i_text_him/
98,ofdal0,1625639056,If a man acts like he doesn’t have feelings,"If a man acts like he doesn’t have feelings, I’m going to treat him like he doesn’t have feelings. Don’t behave as if you do not have feelings if you do not want someone to treat you like you don’t have feelings. Communicate your feelings if you want them to be respected. Don’t get passive aggressive and pretend they’re not there. When I ask you wants wrong, don’t say “nothing”. I guess you’re butthurt cause I refuse to admit that I miss you. And you refuse to say that it hurts your feelings. So I’ll never say it.

99,ofdri0,1625641272,Body language says one thing bur her words and actions say another,"Organising a 4th date with a girl, she keeps agreeing to do things together but her body language reads different. It's hard for me though  because I often spend more time avoid people's eye contact than looking at them, even when sat directly opposite, so I don't give the best impression. But, I do always watch people, even when I look like I'm not, and her body language is confusing... So, I'm confused...

But, if she keeps agreeing to go out with me, is that a good or bad sign? I mean, she might just be bored or just too nice to turn me down or something...",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ofdri0/body_language_says_one_thing_bur_her_words_and/
