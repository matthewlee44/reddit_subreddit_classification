I want to tell him how I feel, but I have no idea how to do so. I have anxiety, overthink a lot, and I'm generally pretty bad at social situations and cues. I can't tell if he feels the same way about me either, so that also adds to me stressing over it. 

I've also heard about other people getting feelings for friends, and the friendship becomes very awkward because the crush is one-sided. I really don't want to ruin my friendship.

I've never had any dating experience or crushes before this, and I'm not very good at expressing how I feel- even when it has nothing to do with romance. I guess I got stuck with a pretty bad combo when it comes to dating, but I want to at least try and make do with how I am.

Things seemed totally wonderful and we were clear and communicative and I was happier than I'd been in a relationship ever before. It was great. I caught some serious feelings for her and she told me and seemed to feel the same.

Recently, some really intense shit has been going on in her life and I've been doing everything I can to support her. She's told me she needs space and basically went from texting me very often all throught the day to texting me 2-3 times per day maximum. She hasn't texted the way she used to in over a week, and I haven't seen her in weeks. I did my best to give her space even though it's really hard for me and I am struggling so much to just sit here knowing she's struggling so much with things.

The honest truth is that I have been in several abusive relationships where when they stop texting me, it's either because they are done and moving on already, or it's because they're cheating on me (I've been cheated on a lot in the past which scarred me a lot). This being said, I trust wholeheartedly that she isn't cheating. The issue is that I have pretty bad anxiety, and my own circumstances in life haven't been wonderful as of late either. I need my own support right now and while I'm trying to be there for her neglecting my own mental health, she doesn't reply to any of the few texts I send her and it breaks my heart. She doesn't open my snapchats (hasn't since the 3rd of August) and now when we were previously the BFFs on snapchat or whatever, we went back to being just best friends or whatever. For whatever reason that kind of kicked me while I was down.

I know it's premature, but I seriously love her. I've been close friends with her for two years and seeing her like this is ruining me, and her ignoring me hurts so much. I honestly don't even know what to do anymore. She's all I've ever asked for and I don't know how to give her space and not feel like absolute garbage when she doesn't text me at all.

Am I selfish for wishing she would compromise a little and at least update me once or twice a day? Even just a ""hey I hope you are doing alright"" or a ""thank you for being here it means a lot"" would suffice. I always tell her I'll be there for her and I'm just a call away from being at her doorstep to help how she needs, but I feel that now I'm giving more than I get. I know she's going through some really horrible stuff, but I'm really struggling here...

I guess I just could use some support or, if I'm in the wrong here, a reason why what I'm doing is toxic...

TL;DR I am really trying to give my partner space, but I feel like the amount of space she needs is too much and due to my own past experiences, her ignoring my texts is hurting me a lot.

Ok I’ll try to make this short bc it’s a 7 year long escapade. I (22F) met a guy (25M) when we were in highschool. I was 15 and he was 18. He left for the marines and we kept in touch over the course of 5 years and even after he came back in 2019. The first time I got to FaceTime him when he was in California he wasn’t this laid back carefree person I once knew. He would look straight through me and had 0 emotion to anything I’d say. So long story short I told him off about a month ago for just wanting to get me in bed and not taking no for an answer. We’ve been in each other’s lives on and off all this time. He was drinking heavily and popping pills while he was in the military and he would get really angry over nothing. He still does sometimes. 

He’s become very impulsive on things too. First it was me, like he couldn’t go a day without talking to me somehow. Then it was guitars, then it was drinking and drugs, then it was cars, now it’s skateboarding and I don’t know what after that because I stopped this shit show last month. Part of me wants to reach out to see if he needs help or if I can get him some, but I’m convinced he’s a psychopath and he has no way of being helped this late into the game. 

I’m also curious as to why he messaged me last month to begin with, as I didn’t give him a chance to explain himself.

25M here - so I matched with a really cute girl on Bumble a week ago and we hit it off instantly. We’ve got some common interests, but above all, she's very career focused/ambitious, which is what's attracting me to her (I rarely match with people like her).

I quickly asked for her number so we could organise a date and she agreed. We then set an evening for our date. Since then, we took the conversation to text, and were literally texting essays. We were talking about a 1000 things, which whilst it was awesome, it required a lot of effort. I then suggested that I’d be down to call in the event our date next week doesn’t go ahead (as our city went into a lockdown), if she’s comfortable. She responded and said she would love to, and was even open to calling the same night if I was free. I agreed, and we had a 2.5 hour phone call before bed.

We vibed really well. It felt effortless. We shared the same views/interests, had a lot of laughs, enjoyed each other's banter. We've since been texting shorter messages/sharing memes, and she seems very interested in me. We had a second phone call last night.

Now majority of my dating experiences have required effort. I have spent a lot of time investing in people who I clearly knew were not interested in me, or I wouldn't last long with in a relationship because there was no chemistry, people that would take 24 hours to text back, never show interest etc.

So this girl, actually texts me. She asks me about my day. She sends me memes/Tik Toks and even double texts them sometimes knowing I'll check them out later when I'm busy at work. This is exactly what I've wanted for so many years.

BUT - it feels very, very, very, very, VERY - strange, to almost be chased or shown interest in? As a man, I'm not used to this. Not that this is making me feel unattracted to her, but its making me feel like there is no chase, this is too easy, and maybe there is something wrong with the girl (almost a feeling of why is she interested in me like this?).

So why is it that when she's showing interest and is keen on me, I feel strange and almost repulsed in the sense that it may be too good to be true? Does anyone else relate to this feeling of wanting to ruin something good?

It was very natural, and I really enjoyed talking with her. I got the vibes that she found me attractive, and enjoyed conversing also. She walks me out to the van, then says you can call us anything if you have any issues. However, she said it clumsily with that cute squished face that woman do, I was left with the impression that it was a clumsy attempt to get me to ask for her number. However, my primitive male brain did not think of that, Instead, I say ""great! what is your name?"" She told me her name, and ""nice to meet you"". Then we both part, it was not until I got into the van that I realized I should have asked for her number.  


Now, I can either A. Chalk it up to experience, and forget about the whole thing. (perhaps she was just being nice, and I am way over thinking this).  


or B. I call the Uhaul place, ask for her and lay out some classic line to get her number? Such as ""Hello Anna, I rented a Uhaul from you the other day. You said I could call if I had any problem, you see I do have an issue. There was this really pretty lady who I just cant get off my mind, and I would really like to take her out for a drink..."" or something along those lines.

I met this guy on Tinder, we both said that we were looking for something casual, fun, &amp; if it led to something more so be it.  So we went on our first date within two weeks of meeting &amp; he texted me really consistently during this time before we met &amp; did the small talk. So for our first date we went to a cool specialty cocktail bar downtown. He was a gentleman, cute, tall, &amp; paid for the drinks. I thanked him &amp; he invited me back to his place to smoke. I said okay, &amp; met him back at his place. We picked a movie to watch, he went in for a kiss &amp; we made out a bit. Eventually it led to more and we fooled around orally, I refused to get nude bc I probably would have went all the way bc I was turned one, &amp; wanted to wait so he did so under my dress which I thought was really hot lol &amp; so did he, he was very sensual. I went down on him too, loved his package uncut &amp; good size had a lot of fun with it lol  afterwards we chilled smoked a bit more &amp; then I went home. The next day I texted him thanks for last night &amp; he said he had a good time for sure &amp; enjoyed my company. 

He asked if we can go out the following week. He came near my area &amp; we went to a restaurant ate , had 2 cocktails he paid again even tho I offered. We had really good convo told me ant his brother mental health crisis, family possibly moving to our state &amp; I shared some stuff about my sister&amp;life. We laughed, we both have adhd so we’re able to connect over that &amp; how we both watch most thing w closed captions. After dinner we went back to my place.  We smoked a joint. We watched a funny movie &amp; this time we did go all the way. I wanted it &amp; obviously he did too &amp; we had fun. I mean he was very vocal, moaning &amp; asking me if I liked things checking in went down, good foreplay, multiple positions &amp; telling me oh you’re so good at this, super tight &amp; I honestly had 3 Os, 30+ mins session we were both so hot after it was good for a first w someone new. Afterwards  he was cool , he wanted to like cuddle play with my hands, footsies &amp; played Nintendo switch-  made out a few more times. He mentioned while playing that he was going to leave after we were done it was already almost 1am and he was tired. To be polite I offered him to sleep over or take a nap  if he was really tired &amp; he said he had some stuff to do in am. Nbd to me, we made out a bit more started to get a little hot &amp; he said he didn’t think he could go again without passing out after lol I was like okay fair, walked him to the door he  kissed me long &amp; passionately &amp; said he’ll text me he got home. 

He did &amp; said “Hey I met to text when I first got in but showered, I’m going to bed now”. 

I said “k, goodnight”. 

He didn’t text me that following day or 2 days later! So I texted him &amp; said “Hey, had a nice ride the other night, wouldn’t mind taking another ride soon 😉”. Lol and No Reply … nothing 

Womp,womp!

However...I'm wondering if talking a little longer and more in depth elicits an explanation or not?  

I've been talking to a guy for about a week via Bumble and his communication style is just not really compatible with mine and I've done a relationship with that kind of communicator before and it is no fun. I wanted to give it a shot though, because he was really unique and wanted to see if it was just a one time thing or a pattern. It was a pattern. We are in the middle of making plans to hang out and he disappears for a couple days at at time, and I'm over it. (He offered a time to meet, and I couldn't do the time and offered some others and then a few days go by and he responds again)

I've never really had this happen where I talk this much with someone and then decide it isn't going to work without even meeting. So not sure what the etiquette is. Should I just not respond back, or say something about how he seems great and it was good talking, but we seem to have different communication styles, or something.

I’m the type of person that hates conflict and confrontation. As a result I’m a pushover and will let people get over on me without complaint. 

My non-confrontational attitude is evident in my relationship because I’m never mad nor do I get upset. Sure I’ll cry but that’s only in response to my bfs anger. Other than that I’m never the one that expresses anger outwardly or how upset I am verbally. Recently I’ve tried to put my foot down because I wasn’t comfortable with my bf driving my car to a different city. 

We’ve had three different arguments about this. Basically he wants to go to Belton, a city that’s 40 mins away, to attend a softball tournament. I tried to ask if I could go with but he said no and refused saying there wasn’t any bleachers. Anyway each time I’ve rejected his plans he got upset and accused me of not caring about his happiness. 

I’d give in because I hate it when he’s mad at me and we’d be ok for a few days. Then my mind reminds me of the uncomfortable feeling I have when the idea of my bf driving to Belton comes up. So I get upset and end up venting to my mom. My mom decides to tell my bf how she feels which is the same as me over text.

My bf doesn’t react well and my mom lets her disdain for him twist her words. I guess my mom implied he was using me and shouldn’t get upset with me for using common sense as he’s not on the insurance and my dad pays for the car and insurance. Now my bf is mad that I made it seem like he was mentally abusing me and being a manipulator. 

All I told my mom was the facts of what was going on. I never once called my bf a “user” like my mom. That’s how she decided to label him after I told her what happened. I just said I was scared that he was going to get angry at me because of the text my mom sent him.

Basically, I really kind of screwed things up. I started liking her more than she liked me and I asked her to hang out every weekend and maybe once a week during the weekdays. I think she felt pressured and now she suddenly said she enjoys spending time with me but, after more thought, she thinks its more as a friend. I think she was definitely more interested before and it felt like got less interested after she probably concluded I was coming on too strong for her. We also did have a kiss on the 4th date but it was one where I had to ask if I can kiss her which i usually don't do because it doesn't feel like it flows correctly. She probably felt pressured on the kiss too. She said she would love to continue spending time together as a friend and I told her I wasn't interested in that.

**1- She laughs at your terrible jokes.**

technically, yes. we usually have too much fun when we are together but idk, she's a very joyful person and this might not be exceptional for me

**2-  She keeps locking eyes with you.**

this happens. and when it happens we 90% smile or laugh

**3-  She reacts to your body language.**

i dont know what this exactly means to be honest. i was really drunk at our graduation party, i am an introverted person normally but with the help of alcohol i become more confident and outgoing, i remember that i was hanging out with another female friend and my crush came and sit near me. i put my hand to her shoulder and we spent like 20-30 minutes like that then we went inside and i danced with my other female friend that i mentioned earlier. (even while being drunk asf, i was still not confident enough to ask my crush first lmao) anyways, when my dance with my friend was over, i saw that my crush was sitting all alone very close to us. now i dont remember most details becaause of the alcohol, but i clearly remember her smile when i asked her to dance with me. ps: when we were dancing i remember her saying that ""that's really romantic i wish someone was recording this"" i really wanted to kiss her that moment but i didn't want to take adventage of a drunk girl.

as i didn't know what  ""She reacts to your body language"", i told you the whole story lol

**4- She seems relaxed around you**

she litteraly wrote ""i feel relaxed around you"" on my yearbook

**5- She leans into you**

tilting her head slightly to mine? yes, i realized that in a picture like:  / O (she's /, im O)

**6- She responds to your texts immediately**

she's a fast responder, but i dont think that this is exceptional to me

When she responds she is not dry or anything like that, but she really takes her time to text back.

The thing is that I just realized that she shares one of those double profile pics with another dude who makes part of her friends circle, which I just started joining a couple weeks ago. I've heard that they have known each other for a while but I'm not really sure if they got something going on, and when they interact I haven't noticed anything special, I always thought they were friends and that's it. I know that this is so vague but I don't really want to ask any of them if they got something going on, mostly because I feel like I still don't have much trust with them as to ask them something like that, I feel like that could possibly make things weird within the group.

So I (M/23 currently) have met this girl (F/20) on a summer camp 3 years ago. We crushed on each other back then but were both too shy/unsure to react to it. We were really touchy and physical and everyone around knew we had a crush. We remained friends and occasionally hung out with the common friends we made.

Then next summer we attended this camp again and clicked again. I decided to act on it this time and I invited her on a date. She was sort of shocked and said she did not see me in that light and she must have sent me the wrong signals. She agreed to go out anyways and we had a nice bar date. She said she is not ready to be with me at that point as she was just starting college and said she was afraid she may meet someone new there that she would like more and does not want to have only a short-term relationship (with me) if that happened. I accepted that as she was really straightforward with me and we remained friends and kept hanging out with our common friend group occasionally.

Fast forward another year to now. We bumped into each other on some occasions this summer but nothing special. Then one day totally out of blue, she invited me on a date, saying she wants to give it another shot. I agreed and we went on a date. It was great, we talked about many date topics like our relationship expectations, preferences, world views, our red flags, future goals, and so on. The date lasted 4+ hours and we both never looked at the phone, we were there in the moment. BUT, she avoided any physical contact. She sat on the other end of the table (not by my side as I like on dates) and when we later went for a walk, she moved away each time I tried to get closer and hold her hand. She offered to pay for the drinks. When we drove home, I mentioned to her that I had a feeling this date was lacking that spark between us (we are quite straightforward with each other since our first date). We both agreed we are kinda on this friends-only tone and we don't know how to proceed from there. She said she sort of likes me and we agreed to give it a chance and do some more dates with her. She also said she is looking for a long-term relationship and does not want to play games and is afraid we may only be together for a while and then break the friendship we built so far. Additionally, she admitted the crush 3 years ago, although she denied it one year ago.

Now the question is, how should I escalate our relationship (to be more intimate and physical)? We definitely broke the touch barrier 3 years ago when we first met, but now it seems that barrier is back. Other than that, we have quite some things in common and are generally compatible, and always have deep conversations (no small talk).

Due to lack of interest in physical contact and also sort of unresponsive texts (usually responds in 12-24 hours, so it is hard to maintain a convo there; she said she does not like texting, but texts a lot with her girl friends) I have that feeling she is not really interested in me that much, but on the other hand, seems to have fun talking with me in person, invited me on a date (the first time girl actually invited me, not the other way around), said she sort of likes me and agreed to do more dates. I am sooo confused. I no longer have a crush on her as I had 3 years ago, but she really is a great girl and I still like her.

Additional: She never had a relationship, neither did I. She only had some party hookups. The first date she had was with me last year, so we both sorta lack experience in this field in one way or another.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,949097,public,self,"A friend invited me on a date after a year, but she seems uninterested at the same time",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p2bkpt/a_friend_invited_me_on_a_date_after_a_year_but/,all_ads,6,,

And then bam. “You’re fucking ugly”, “Ew no”, “I’m way out of you’re league”, and my personal favorite, “You’re so confident to think you have a chance with me”.

And before you ask, no my standards aren’t too high. I’d rate myself a 4 when I put a lot of effort in and the women I try with are definitely not supermodels or even average looking. But even when they’re not better looking than me, they take the opportunity to just shit on me.

We both said we're just looking for something casual for now, but not opposed to things becoming more serious. Our last date was three weeks ago now, having a full week of work after our third date followed by a 2 week holiday. We both don't really like texting so generally we just text to arrange dates. Our last conversation, the day before she went on holiday went as follows:

Me 'Hey hope you've had a good week - just wanted to wish you a good holiday and a safe flight! I'm sure you'll have an awesome time on the beaches of ... Lemmie know when you're back and what days you have free! Anyway have fun :) x'

Her 'Aw thank you!! I cannot wait!! I've been roped into working tonight but at least after this I'm done :) We fly back late on the 10th of August but have no idea what my shifts will be that week x'

Me 'Yeah I bet! Ah the bastards XD as you say, at least you'll get a nice long break away - you'll be on the beach in no time! Okay awesome, you can tell me all about it when we next see eachother :) x'

Her 'Yes can't wait! I still haven't even started packing yet XD Okay will do :) x'


So it's been 2 weeks since that exchange and she would have got back last night. I told her to let me know so part of me thinks I should stick to that and wait for her to message me, and not seem over eager and give her a chance to settle back down and find out her shifts. Another part of me thinks sod it, and message her anyway.

I (28f) have been dating this guy (35m) for 9 months. I am a confident woman who has great friendships and career. When I met this guy, I was happy with myself. I was making choices everyday that made me love myself a little more. 

Recently I’ve been feeling low. I have not been diligent on my fitness habits and it has played into my self esteem. Not a huge deal, I know I can get back on track, but I’d rather not be reminded right now that I’m not stoked on gaining some weight. Being in a new relationship and the pandemic are to blame for this. I decided to tell my partner how I’ve been feeling, thinking that it would be helpful that he know so he can support me in my diet and gym. (He does not workout and eats very unhealthily.) I just need him to be okay with the fact that I will no longer be eating and drinking with him on every whim. Simple. 

Here’s where things went left. In trying to practice vulnerability, I told him that I’m having a hard time comparing myself to other women right now. I’m only realizing this after he shot a music video for music he’s working on. I was not told that there would be video girls there and showed up to see hottractive women surrounding my boyfriend for several hours. I put my big girl pants on and continued to be supportive. I decided to enjoy myself and try to shake off the fact that my insecurities were in the back of my mind. That day has been bothering me so I decided to tell my guy about it. I requested that in the future I’d like a heads up if he planned on having a shoot with model type women there. It could help me mentally prepare especially because right now I’m not feeling the most confident. 

He lost it. He believes I should know that that’s the nature of music videos, specifically rap and he shouldn’t have to have a conversation about something like this. That I should be strong enough to handle it. He is now saying that I presented myself in a confident manner, so much so that that’s a primary reason he chose to be with me. Now that he knows I am insecure and can potentially be insecure in other settings he’s in, he doesn’t want to continue dating. 

I’m just beside myself. I am a whole person who was feeling low and felt I could confide in my partner. It backfired. The lesson here is that ultimately insecurities are not attractive. I can’t help but think that my self esteem is something I should have just put in check on my own, rather than discussing it with my partner. This has changed how he perceives me as a person which is unfortunate. He believes that me comparing myself that day is really just jealousy and he doesn’t want to deal with that. I don’t agree, but maybe I’m not seeing the situation correctly. 

Anyway, I sabotaged my own happiness because I let my insecurity get to me. Don’t be like me. Some things like insecurity and mental health need to be dealt with by YOU and not you and your partner.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,949267,public,self,Guy I’m Dating Wants To Breakup Because I Revealed I’m Insecure.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p2eay7/guy_im_dating_wants_to_breakup_because_i_revealed/,all_ads,6,,
