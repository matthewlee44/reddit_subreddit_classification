I don’t have a “mom bod” after having a baby and I lost most of my baby weight immediately so I don’t think I’m anymore unattractive than when we first started dating. I asked him last night if he would rather masturbate instead of having sex with me and expressed to him that before I felt like I had to compete with other girls and now I have to compete with porn, and I can’t do that. By the end of the argument he said that the reason he doesn’t want to have sex with me is because he’s afraid that we will get pregnant again.

She's funny, smart, kind and pretty cute.

She's very likeable, but she has what could be perceived as a weird way of communicating with people; if she thinks she might like someone or want someone to be her friend, she'll immediately start talking shit to them - but in a complimentary manner. She's probably the queen of backhanded compliments; it's kind of like the 'push-pull' every PUA talks about whilst discussing good game. 

Generally, it works pretty well for her - a lot of people with good social skills are friends with her. Howver, when I first met her, I thought she was kind of loud and annoying because I was immature and didn't understand social situations.

My social skills have improved a LOT though, and I've been getting much better at recognising signs from people; whether they want to be my mate or, in a girl's case, whether they are interested in me. What I've noticed about this particular chick is that while she's incredibly witty, matches my level of intelligence and is fantastic to talk to, she can't take a compliment.

I don't know if this is true with all of her guy friends; most of them aren't really interested in having her as a girlfriend because they're either attached or think she's too good of a friend to potentially sacrifice if a relationship with her went badly. 

However, I don't care about any of that; I like her. I know I do. The problem is I don't know if she likes me. I generally try to match her style of social interaction (backhanded compliments and witty banter) - that's why we get along so well. However, whenever I give her a genuine compliment, she accepts it pretty bashfully and with a cute, genuine smile on her face.

For example, one time I told her she looks like a female celebrity (Anne Hathaway) and all she did was smile - she couldn't even look me in the eye when I gave her the compliment and it seemed a bit inconsistent with her character. 

She's also an awful texter - like if you don't take effort to double text her she'll leave you on read for months. She's outright told me she absolutely hates texting. But when I text her, she responds to me pretty regularly. Like every couple of days or so, which by her standards is really good

That same night, we were watching a movie with a few friends and we were huddled up against each other - not extremely close, but our shoulders were touching and she didn't budge at all. She's also completely fine with me touching her and doesn't back off at all when I do. 

She also tells me stuff about her family; like even when we first BECAME friends she would tell me what her relationship with her mom and dad was like - I don't really think that's particularly normal for a girl you just met and I'm not sure if she's just an open person, but it doesn't seem like she tells any of her other guy friends THAT much - at least definitely not within a few days of becoming friends with them.

So I don't really know what to do; she's showing all the signs that she might like me as more than a friend but I'm afraid if I ask her out too soon it'll sabotage the friendship. Also, I don't wanna be waiting around too long because she's legit a 1/10000 type of girl. I don't know if I'll ever find someone as compatible as her.

Of course, if I got rejected we would still be friends - but I'd always be thinking about what 'could've been'. And I really fucking hate regretting shit.

We both had exes who stopped counting somewhere in the 100s. 

As I said, i have a first date tonight. I doubt we will be discussing how many men either of us has slept with but, from conversation, we have both engaged in casual sex and are open to that while looking for a more long term situation.

I am a trans guy who is thinking of detransitioning because even though I am heavily dysphoric I really don't need anything else that will make it difficult for people to relate to or like me. I am bisexual which has been a huge issue in all of my relationships because everybody automatically thinks I'm some kind of cheater. I have a very severe scoliosis and you can tell right away there's something wrong with me. I have a pectus excavatum and severe asthma. I am unemployed but I live on my own and I am on disability and SSI. I do not own a car. I am also in my late twenties but I look like I am still in high school. Also short, five foot two and that alone got me rejected even when I was presenting as female because my partners would say they felt like they were dating a little kid. 

To this day because of my height and my young face the only people who show any interest in me at all are chasers and men who are in their fifties at least looking for someone fresh out of high school. 

Even pre-transition I was very masculine looking and I had a male body shape and no boobs. And I'm going to be bluntly honest - I have a terrible personality. I am shy, anxious, everything I like is thought of as being very lame (cats, anime, painting, crystals, horror movies, emo music, numetal,  camping, urban exploration and graffiti), and I'm very cynical. I also have ADHD and I am so forgetful people have mistaken my ADHD for a manic episode and decided to dump me because of the old don't stick your dick in crazy thing. They don't understand that this and the hyperactivity comes from ADHD and that my doctor refuses to medicate me for it. The only thing I can say that I have going for me is that I have a good face, I'm at healthy weight, apparently really good at sex, some people say I'm funny, and apparently I am at least somewhat intelligent.

Another issue is that I have an extremely high sex drive. I had this issue even before I was on testosterone. Most of my partners found it to be gross and off-putting. Someone who doesn't have a dick isn't supposed to have a super high sex drive you know? And no, I don't sleep around. My body count is only 3. I also have very masculine mannerisms, even before I transitioned and it put most people off. I'm competitive, I'm as strong as most cisgender men despite my height, people say that my voice sounds very condescending even though I don't intend for it two and I sound like a smug know-it-all, and people have an issue with how assertive and dominant I am. I actually am not confident at all but people say that I come off as being off-puttingly cocky and that it makes me come off as really abrasive. Not to mention I'm a huge extrovert and all of my exes had a major problem with that because the fact that I wanted to hang out with a couple of friends a couple of times a month caused major jealousy. Basically my entire personality needs replacing and I'm your stereotypical  ENTP-T minus the cheating and mindgames because I don't believe in that kind of garbage.

I have a type. I like clean, charismatic kinda pretty men in my age range who are respectful of me. I'm not into pushy hyper-aggressive macho types which are mostly all I can attract. I had one guy who was definitely my type who seemed to find me highly attractive me until recently and then he noticed my ADHD symptoms of anxiety, disorganization, hyperactivity and forgetfulness and now he thinks I'm bipolar and manic. 

He mistook my symptoms as a manic episode and since his ex was bipolar and it scared him off. He thinks I'm batshit crazy. As a matter of fact my stupid 80-hd alone has also gotten me turned down by the majority of people I have shown any interest in because they don't think I had ADHD or issues with hyperactivity, they think I'm just a complete lunatic. If I could convince my doctor to put me on something for it again, I think I would be doing a lot better. I used to be on Vyvanse and I was doing pretty good.

A few months ago it ended somewhat badly, which is reasonable to be expect in most cases I suppose. To my knowledge I am not stuck on my ex, nor am I bothered by how it went down. It was somewhat of a relief tbh. When we separated, my friends were psyched for me and encouraged myself to “put myself back out there” and/or “play the field”, etc. 

I’ve even had girls interested in me. When one of my female friends heard, she basically told me she was coming over and asked me what I wanted to drink even though I never indicated I wanted to drink at all lol. Since I’ve been single I’ve been wholly disinterested in dating and even sex. It just seems like a lot of work for something that’s not really worth it. I’ve just been focused on finishing college, advancing my career / socioeconomic standing, etc. 

I thought after a few months I would be excited or at least motivated to date but it’s been about 8 months now and I’m still not interested. I even met a girl who I thought is cute and cool. I considered getting to know her a bit better and I suppose I have on a platonic level. She’s shown signs of interest and I’ve definitely gotten signals that she at least wants my attention. But even with that I find myself not caring enough to do anything about it. 

I frequently run into these scenarios where attractive women show interest in me and I often leave them disappointed, frustrated, or even offended in some cases it seems. I do daydream about sex as much as any other person but it’s just so much easier to go home and take care of it myself. I don’t have to worry about anything other than what I want, and I don’t have to spend any more time / energy on it than I want to. 

At first I felt this was a really great thing because I’ve never been so focused, productive, and effective at managing things &amp; making progress. I just find myself waiting for someone to evoke my desire enough to pursue a “connection” as Reddit experts would likely call it. But I am starting to wonder if I should be concerned about being too comfortable with isolation and/or enjoy it too much. I am considering just forcing myself to actively date to prevent isolation from becoming too prevalent even though I really am loving being alone.

We met on Tinder. It was my first and only Tinder date (so far!). I felt like I hit the lottery. 

For some context, we took things slowly. For the first time in my life we did not sleep together before being officially in a relationship. 

After a few months of dating, we friend request each other on Facebook. Come to find out we have a high number of mutual friends. 

Upon looking through this mutual friend list, I noticed that not only are most of them women but most of them are horse people. As in, people in the equine industry. 

I thought it was unusual that so many of them are fellow riders - people I know at least tangentially. 

Horses have quite literally saved my life and I started riding as a way to reconnect with my emotions. It is a safe place for me. 

When I have confronted him about how he knows so many horse girls, he said he met most on Tinder but did not end up on more than one or two dates but still remained friends. 

Fast forward to this week, my boyfriend tells me that he wants to head up to New York for the weekend to hike with a friend. He provided me with full disclosure that this was a woman he met on Tinder years ago and that this woman is also a horseback rider. He will sleep in her spare bedroom. 

I trust him not to cheat. That being said, there’s something that doesn’t quite sit right with me and feels a little gross knowing that I was just another horse girl from Tinder. 

He has never been in a relationship with these women (there’s at least 10 of them) except for me. 

I should mention that he himself is not a rider and has no involvement in the industry. 

Am I wrong for feeling fetishized? Is fetishized what I’m feeling? Should I be worried this is a pattern of unhealthy behavior in him? Am I overthinking this?

I hope y'all enjoy!

Last summer, I (M,22) went on three dates with one of my good friends (F,24) over about two months (longish distance).

We had gone to college together and were in the same close friend group. She graduated two years before I did; last summer I was heading into my senior year. I had asked her out when I was a sophomore and she was a senior. She said no, and we were able to quickly move on and still be good friends. I was never going to ask her out again.

In March of last year (pretty much during the time the world was shutting down), we hadn't really talked for about 8 months. She randomly called me one night when I literally needed someone the most. I was in the middle of an emotional breakdown and felt like I had nobody to talk to about it. She was in a weird spot too, and we talked and processed stuff, and it was good. We stayed in touch more after that.

Two months later, I had small wedding to go to. I spontaneously asked her to go with me the night before because I wanted a friend. She came, and it was really great! We spent the whole day together, including an hour car ride and some time with friends after the wedding. It was great to see her; again, I had no other motives or intentions besides going to a wedding with a good friend.

Three days later, she called me and told me she was starting to catch feelings for me. We went on a date shortly after that. We lived 2 hours away from each other at the time, so it was probably about a week later. It was a great date! We ended up going on two more that summer. I really liked her and I thought we'd end up being together.

She called it off after the third date.

She said I did all the right things and didn't do anything wrong. She was definitely physically attracted to me and thought I was really great. She just didn't have any romantic feelings for me. That hurt. A lot. That was a few weeks before college started again. I was seriously so devastated. I couldn't really understand how all of that could be true and she just didn't feel anything for me. We would still text occasionally. She wasn't really hurt at all, so talking to me didn't bother her. I thought I could still talk and be friends with her, but eventually I just had to tell her that I couldn't be friends with her fro the time so I could heal and move on.

Then in January, I moved to the same city as her. I was finally in a good place to be able to be friends with her again, especially because we still had many of the same friends in the same city. I texted her and said I wanted to be friends again. She was more than happy to be friends again.

She was single at the time, and now she's dating a fantastic guy, and I couldn't be happier. We've been able to hang with friends together and have serious conversations about things (like people we're interested in dating, etc.). I'm truly grateful for her friendship.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1037847,public,self,"A year after going on a few dates with one of my best friends, here's where we're both at",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pzchdl/a_year_after_going_on_a_few_dates_with_one_of_my/,all_ads,6,,,,,

My general type is usually older guys but apart from that not picky.

So in school I’ve been there’s been a guy that I SWEAR has just been looking at me like i don’t know how to explain it. For example I’ll be walking with my friend and the same for him but then I turn around and he turns around to look at me too, and today I was sitting diagonal from him so I could see him in the corner of my eye and he was talking to his friend and both started looking at me??? it’s been happening since the moment we laid eyes on each other. He smiles at me etc and has strong eye contact. Like this isn’t even in a narcissistic way I promise I just don’t know how to explain it properly. Anyways here’s the problem:

We have a mutual couple of friends and let’s call them Annie and Debbie. So Annie and him are quite close and I feel like he likes Annie. She calls after him a lot and he talks to her and he always seeks out Debbie. He knows I’m friends with Annie and Debbie because he talks to us when we’re all together but when he sees me alone he just stares not approaching me. He and Annie would look good together she’s way prettier and funnier than me. He added me on social media but hasn’t popped up. HE IS A YEAR YOUNGER!!! Which I’ve never dealt with before, I’m quite submissive so I tend to gravitate to older guys.

I like his confidence and strong eye contact and he just has a nice vibe to him but he just doesn’t really acknowledge me outside staring and prefers to speak to my friends :(

I know lot of you are insecure about your penis so I’m gonna give some light on why you shouldn’t be insecure. And I’m talking about all sizes cuz I’ve met some dudes with the biggest. One of them was huge and he told me he wished he was bigger and I didn’t really understand why cuz if it was it would’ve probably went up my cervix. I think a big problem about sex is pornography and our sex education. Please don’t compare yourself to men in porn :( that’ll just make everything worse. Also don’t let the women who suck shame you get you down sex is so much more than the size of you’re penis and to the ladies who have dick shamed men SHAME ON YOU YOU ARE WHATS WRONG WITH SOCIETY.


Want to know something? Most of us can’t orgasm from PIV alone.

I’ve been with guys with small, average, and huge and wanna know what? When it comes to being with the bigger dudes they think that massive shlong is all they need to bring to the party and at the end of the day your cervix will hate you. Being huge can be a curse. I’ve seen the outline of a dudes boner and I became very VERY afraid and got the hell out of there.

Im gonna talk about the big guys first. I know you must be proud of you’re member down there and good for you if you are but you can really hurt us if you are not careful and just because you’re big doesn’t mean you’re talented in bed. Make sure you do lots of foreplay on us first so we can get as wet as possible. There are many sex positions and I think for big guys doggystyle is one of the best IF YOU ARE CAREFUL, AND USE LOTS OF LUBE. Missionary is a great position but not with my legs on you’re shoulders I’ll hold them myself. Also reverse cowgirl is good because I have more control to how much dick goes in me. Also big dicks are harder to give blowjobs it’s not always fun and if I give you a bj I expect you to reciprocate and eat me out fair is fair.

Now I’m gonna address the little peeners. When it comes to smaller guys I have a bit of weight advice for ya. You may think you have a small dick but if you’ve got some pounds on ya those lbs in the pelvic area might be hiding some extra inches and if you lose weight you might see those inches I’ve known some guys who have lost weight and I noticed that their dick was bigger than it was before. With a smaller dick try putting a pillow under her ass when you are doing missionary because you can give her that full feeling this has worked for me plenty of times and it feels great. But before you put that dick in her please please please do lots of foreplay as it makes us really want you and beg for you. Now every girl is different but I love it when my neck gets sucked, kissing all around my breasts, pinching my nipples, rubbing circles around my nipples, kissing all around my belly, rubbing softly down the side of my thighs, kissing and sucking my thighs, I love being eaten out and fingered you gotta grove the clit lots of attention. Whoever you are with ask her what feels good to the clit and listen. Communication goes a long way :) also cowgirl is a great position. EXPERIMENT EXPERIMENT EXPERIMENT.

And now for the average dudes :D
If you are average then you are literally most men. Small and large are the minority. I’m going to be honest I believe I have had the best sex with guys who are average. So please don’t be ashamed that you are average and never EVER compare yourself (this goes for small guys as well) to a massive dick remember what I said at the top. For average the scissor position is great look it up and learn how to do it. For this size doggystyle is amazing because it’s not to big and not to small and if she has a big butt spread her cheeks for more insertion or have her do it. Cowgirl and reverse cowgirl are a great positions for this size. Oh and btw if you want to do anal bigger really isn’t better for that average and smaller is better in that area.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1037991,public,nsfw,To all those who are insecure about their penis size.

She was standing in a book store with 2 of her friends. This girl has always stood out in a crowd to me, she has literally the perfect physique and genes and is a perfect 10. I talked to her a bit in HS but it didn't really go anywhere but I saw my opportunity and worked up the courage to approach her. She was standing in the Psych section with her friends holding a copy of some Abnormal Psych book, seemingly skimming through. As I walked through the aisle she was in, Belinda Carlisle's ""I feel free"" began playing through the store speakers. I was immediately very viscerally shocked at how beautiful she still was. It was intimidating. She was wearing a chemise dress in double-faced wool by Calvin Klein. One of her friends noticed me approaching and made eye-contact with me. She was wearing a wool knit dress and jacket with silk faille bonding by Geoffrey Beene, the other friend is wearing a symmetrical skirt of pleated tulle and an embroidered velvet bustier by, I think, Christian Lacroix plus high-heeled shoes by Sidonie Larizzi. She looked as beautiful as another time I ran into her while out on the town when she had worn a black strapless sequined gown under a wool crepe tailored jacket by Bill Blass. Her friend smiled at me and nudged my crush, who then looked up at me and smiled politely. I matched her smile but didn't over exert myself so as to not seem too interested. 
""I've heard that that books sources aren't too credible."", I started. Her eyes scanned over my torso, seeming to observe and appreciate my apparel. I was wearing double-breasted wool and silk sport coat, button-fly wool and silk-trousers with inverted pleats by Mario Valentino, a cotton shirt by Gitman Brothers, a polka-dot silk tie by Bill Blass and leather shoes from Brooks Brothers.
""Well, I'm really only looking to cite some of the literature this author referenced...""
As she continues speaking, her voice trails off into a distant, unintelligible warbling as I begin to worry in my head about my appearance; Is my hair slicked back correctly? Is the tension in my suspenders optimal? Did the wax-polish finish on my horn-rimmed glasses reflect ideally in the stores lighting? As my internal dialogue berates itself, she continues speaking then abruptly stops; apparently she had asked me a question. 
""Yes, well that's really, very quite nice."" I responded blindly. 
""... What?"" She retorts, seeming to confide in me that she didn't understand my response. I have a tendency to be a bit too esoteric in social settings and courting beautiful women is not an exemption; an unfortunate by-product of my vigorous intellect.
I allow the silence to linger on for a burning micro-second, letting the non-conversation stir in its own nothing so the stagnation process feels all the more intense. I'm quite honestly very enthralled by the vacuous nature of her half-hearted response; I can feel the rejection coming soon and become aroused yet mystified. Another few micro-seconds crawl by when I finally decide to quell her social hunger with a response, ""I'm in touch with humanity..."" 
I can basically telepathically feel her own pulse revolting away at itself, thundering around inside her veins. She's probably in love with me at this point but is not happy about it. She begins to drone on again about some forgettable details about the book and some paper she's working on, so I distract myself momentarily by thinking about what my friends are wearing at the moment. My friend McDermott is wearing a woven-linen suit with pleated trousers, a button-down cotton and linen shirt by Basile, a silk tie by Joseph Abboud and ostrich loafers from Susan Bennis Warren Edwards, which is moderately tasteful. My other friend, Van Patten is wearing a double-breasted navy blue blazer with mock-tortoiseshell buttons, a prewashed wrinkled-cotton striped dress shirt with red accent stitching, a red, white and blue fireworks-print silk tie by Hugo Boss and plum washed-wool trousers with a quadruple-pleated front and slashed pockets by Lazo. I find myself unable to concentrate on my internal monologue because the monotone wall of noise escaping her mouth is acutely satisfying and entrancing; I think I am in love. Apparently, as I was covertly enjoying her speech cadence, she had said goodbye and began to walk away. I hardly noticed as I spotted a hot, blonde hardbody approaching from my Eastern flank. She was wearing a bicolored suit of wool and grain with passementerie trim by Myrone de Premonville and velvet ankle boots. Her face is identical to the girl I had just courted so I permit her my attention for a moment. As she passes from my right to my left, the gait in her step seems to stutter for a microcosm of a second; she is possibly flirting with me. Our gazes meet as she passes, not even smiling but I know she's attracted to me. As she leaves, I can't help but wonder what could have gone wrong with the other girl. Fearing that she may have possibly not have been into me, my pain becomes constant and sharp. There is no catharsis; my punishment continues to elude me, and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself. No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling.

We immediately hit it off conversation-wise. A lot of things in common, great flirty rapport, etc. I asked if he had social media (ya know..to verify he was real) he said no he hates social media, which is not a red flag for me at all. Fast forward a few hours and we moved to text. Nonstop. Like real, deep conversation all night. I eventually wanted to move to a phone call but he didn't seem to want to but rather text me persistently.. Lil strange. After a week of texting, I suggested we meet up. He was love-bombing me nonstop for the past few days. Telling me he feels so close to me like we've known each other for years...can see himself dating me for real yada yada.

So I suggested a drink last night and he said he was down. He gets off work late so I said if he wanted to raincheck I was totally fine with it. He said no he really wants to meet up and I was off today so I didn't mind the time. He doesn't confirm with me a time to meet up all evening and I asked him when I should start getting ready. You know....because I want to have enough time to do hair and makeup and look cute and all. Nothing. An hour passes by after he got off work and he finally says he's going to hop in the shower. I then proceed to text him again, let me know when you leave your house because that should be enough time for me to do the finishing touches and meet him. Nothing again.

At this point, I'm just waiting around in limbo wondering what the hell is going on. Finally, he says I'm driving I should be at the bar in 20 mins. Around the 20 min mark, I call him. NO ANSWER. I am getting super anxious at this point and annoyed as hell. 40 mins later I call again...nothing. I text him that I will just go to bed and forget it.

He then proceeds to text me 15 minutes later.... ""I'm here."" Stupidly and semi guilty (eye roll) I start driving toward the bar. When I get there he doesn't answer my text or call after I text ""I'm here now too."" He says he thought I was going to bail on him so he called a friend to meet him up at the bar.... ???

I said okay well I'm outside, where are you. (since we never met in person before) NOTHING. Silence. Then he asks me if I have a charger. I reply, ""no."" At this point, I just park and start walking in. I don't see anyone in the bar that remotely resembles the pics I've seen of him and he's nowhere to be found. Call again......NOTHING.

I at this point am LIVID and embarrassed as hell. I really thought we had a strong connection over the last few days and was not sure wtf happened last night. I sent a f\*\*\* off text and that I was pissed and riding back home and he still hasn't responded to me. I am DONE with online dating. This happened to me after I took a LONG hiatus from dating too. Which is the super upsetting part.

NO, I will never speak to this kid again...but what the hell was that? It was a complete 180 from the guy I was talking to all week. The same guy who opened up to me about his family problems....etc. I thought I vetted him well enough. (i.e. tons of voice texts on Imessage, candid photos..)

I have some childhood friends who are brothers. We usually catch up every several months via video call and stay in touch through social media. We were video chatting a few days ago and one of them had to log off. His brother stayed on to chat with me for an additional 2.5 hrs. We have a lot in common... We're both in design careers and have some other overlapping values/interests. Last year, I happened to apply for graduate school in his city but didn't go because I couldn't afford the tuition. Meanwhile, I had always known that he hated his city and wanted to leave, so when he finally got a new job with the opportunity to work remotely indefinitely, I was happy for him. 

He's planning on moving soon to try out a new city since he can work anywhere. At one point in our conversation, he said that he hadn't dated anyone in the last few years because he had been laser focused on leaving the city for good and didn't want to have a reason to stay.  However, he said that if I had come to his city for graduate school he wouldn't have minded staying there a bit longer and would have taken me out. Which idk if in this context he's just saying, ""yeah, I'd show you the city!"". Before we logged off, he asked if I would come visit him before he moves away.   


Ummm yeah so anyway... I'm confused. Is this him just being super friendly? We don't actually talk THAT often so I was surprised to hear him say stuff like this.

I don’t really remember the last time I really LIKED someone. I was in a “relationship” last year and it started out platonically/non intentional which is my favorite way of starting relationships. I graduated last year and we broke up and since then I just cannot meet anyone that makes me want to continue conversing for more than a day.

I used to be in a relationship for 3 years (we are no longer together, but that’s a story for another time!!) and I find that I am definitely a lover girl. I love the intimacy, the trust, the security, everything about it, I just love love! 😂 

But these days it almost feels like the single life is being forced upon us ladies and I don’t like it. It’s completely fine for some of us to want to be single and date and to focus on other aspects of life, but for some of us that’s not the case. I’m kinda tired of having the whole “stay single and love your self/love yourself and then maybe someone will come around” shoved down my throat everytime I scroll through social media. Like yea that’s cool and all but what does that have anything to do with me wanting a man!? 😂

I also kinda feel like it’s being more and more normalized to just be alone and to be like “f-ck men”. I just don’t agree because listen…. This lonely life is not for the weak!! This is the loneliest I’ve ever been. I have absolutely 0 friends, no boo, I’m not even actively dating right now lol but that doesn’t mean I’m not deserving of a healthy loving relationship and a set of great friends. 

I just hate to hear people get called desperate and thirsty for dimpling stating that they’d like to be in relationship (and as long as they aren’t getting into one for all the wrong reasons then they’re good). And tbh I don’t consider myself desperate for love, because tbh the old me would’ve probably been messing with guys who I know aren’t any good for me/trying to find a ‘boyfriend’ in every guy I come across and still hanging around friends that are no good for me out of desperation.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1038165,public,self,What’s wrong with wanting love/a relationship??,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pzgait/whats_wrong_with_wanting_lovea_relationship/,all_ads,6,,,,,

now that i’m getting into online dating this has become like a weird insecurity of mine bc it’s definitely noticeable how big my hands are compared to my body. they’re slender and i put rings on and paint my nails to help them look better but i still get insecure about it.

Before we met up the conversations were really fluid and had fast responses typically, after we met up she did say that she would like to see me again. But the energy has changed since we met up, I’m still pursuing and trying to meet up. But I feel like she doesn’t want to.

She usually liked to banter and talk shit but now not so much.
