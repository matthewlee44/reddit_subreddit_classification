She was attractive and seemed to be very sweet. We hit it off quite well during the event, and she asked for my number during the event. After parting, I invited V to some other outings/hangouts, but she flaked on me last minute several times, which made me completely dropped her at the time.

Fast forward to NYE, I got a text from V out of the blue asking me if I want to spend NYE with her together, partly to apologize for the previous flakes due to her insane work schedules (which was actually valid). Having no plans due to original plan cancelled from Omnicron concerns, I agreed. We went out, had dinner, and walked around. V initiated contact by wrapping around my arm as we walk, which I reciprocated by holding her hand, and had a kiss at the end. We had dinner again together with C and others the next day, and things were looking good.

We didn't see each other until 1 week later (daily short texts in between due to our busy schedules) where I picked her up for a group outing. I held her hand during the drive, which she reacted with a bewildered ""What are you doing?"". I said ""Holding your hand?"", which she replied ""I'll consider it"" before PUSHING me away FORCEFULLY. I was utterly shocked and hurt, but played it cool since we are still meeting up with friends later. I was very sad that day but put on my best act.

I was completely fed up at that point and stopped talking to her. Couple days later, she called me, saying that she could sense that I was mad and asked me out for dinner to make it up to me, which I rejected. 1 week later, C invited me to another outing in which V was also present. V pulled me to the side and told me that she's in a really bad and chaotic spot in her life (insane job, family health issues, ex cheated and hurt her really bad) and IS NOT READY TO DATE RIGHT NOW (lmao I've heard this before), before asking me if I can give her a chance of at least being friends. I folded out of sympathy, and agreed to go to dinner with her, and more or less reconcile the ""friendship"". I still kept a bit of distance from her.

After this incident, she became a lot more attentive and respectful towards me. 3 weeks ago I was absolutely hammered at a party and she offered to drive me back. All I could remember was waking up on her couch in the morning with little to no memories of how I got there. She made breakfast for us, I ate, chatted with her, and left after for another lunch meeting. Nothing intimate happened but I caught some feelings at that moment. Friends who witness her leaving with me that night was convinced that she digs me.

We have been seeing each other a bit more frequently recently, mostly one-on-one hangouts which both of us taking turns initiating. I would frequently break the touch barrier and flirt with her but she will only reciprocates it sparingly, sometimes keeping herself at arms distance when we walk together, while re-iterating how she doesn't want to be in a relationship right now.  On the other hand, she will also say things like ""If you getting to-go from xxx place, you can bring it to my place to eat."" or ""We can watch this together"" after sending me a clip of a very romantic movie that she likes. She also tells me the kind of guy he likes, in which I fit all the categories. Mixed signals off the roof FFS. 

REDDIT: I don't think this is going anywhere and I just feel like she's stringing me along. Part of me likes her (or I won't be giving her so many chances, pathetic, you might say), but part of me is reserved from her due to the couple times how she hurtfully and disrespectfully treated me, and how she is so hard to read. Should I just straight out ask her what is the deal, or should I just distanced myself. We do share a same social circle. Additionally, I think one reason that she doesn't want to lose me is because I'm much more popular than her, and have a very good social reputation. Pissing me off would only harm her.

I've wanted a boyfriend since my early teens, but I guess as I've gotten older it has made me more sad. This is especially true because back in high school most of my friends had never been in relationships either, but the majority of them have now that we've gone to college. So I guess I feel like the weird one now. I want to specify that even if none of my friends had dated before I would still feel the desire for a boyfriend because it is something I personally want rather than something I feel pressured to do, seeing my friends have relationships is just a reminder of that missing puzzle piece essentially. I just want to experience what it's like to be loved now.

I have made a couple attempts at asking crushes out, both have said no but that's okay! I am happy to experience rejection because now I am more confident to just go for it in the future. I have learned that the possibility of a relationship is worth the little bit of hurt I feel when I get rejected. I am perfectly willing to put forth the effort for the right guy, I don't need him to ask me.

Since I am going into senior year of college in the fall, I unfortunately don't have tons of spare time for clubs that could get me closer with some people at my school. So that isn't really an option at the moment. I am going to try and attend more school events though!

So basically I do have some plans to initiate finding someone. For example, I want to try out some bars and whatnot since I am turning 21 next month. I'm not interested in drinking so it's not really my scene, but I would be down to go with a friend and vibe since I know it's a very social situation that tends to encourage approaching people and being approached. I'm hoping there's some dance clubs nearby because I love to dance and so I would not mind crashing one of those with my girl friends lol. I also plan to get a job as a front desk worker at a gym. It seems enjoyable enough and the front desk person always gets to chat with everyone coming in, so more opportunities to meet new people.

So, she’s not shy around anyone except me. Before I asked her out, she was perfectly normal around me. Now, although I don’t know for sure, I get the sense that she’s overthinking literally everything. 

She loves having conversations with me (she’s constantly smiling and laughing), but she seems like she might be thinking way too much about what to say next. There are also a lot of awkward pauses, most of which are filled by me (not many by her).

Also, she clearly feels uncomfortable starting conversations (irl or otherwise), again, with me but not others. She will often stand or sit near me at work, prompting me to spark a convo, but she never speaks first. And she never texts first, but always replies reasonably quickly, and is much better at carrying on a convo over text. And she never calls me, but always answers my calls. 

Conversely, the problem could be that she has trouble initiating. She might just be pivoting off of whatever I do. I just don’t know!!!

So time for another story about OLD since this sub doesn’t see enough of it ;). 

I spent some time on tinder originally to find people just to talk to and fuck around with, well I ended up meeting someone that I pursued a ldr with. Now this long distance relationship wasn’t exactly that long of a distance. It was just upstate. 

When first talking to this girl, I made it clear that I was just looking for friends or people to kick it with on downtime and such, but things ended up “heating up” in a way. She basically would check off all my boxes without even trying and one day she just confessed while we were FaceTiming.

I told her I felt the same way and we ended up agreeing to go exclusive. I told her prior that in one of my previous relationships I was cheated on for both my size and because of terrible communication from one of my ex’s part. She told me that it wasn’t an issue for her and she wouldn’t do that to me. 

Welp to make a long story short we were exclusive for about a total of two weeks. All it took for her was two weeks to up and leave me. Turns out she was talking to another dude on the side. I’m not trippin to heavy, it was only two weeks that it was an “official” thing. To be honest I wouldn’t call it cheating or a relationship more like an “it was there so why not” kinda thing. 

I am fucking pissed about the lying though. More so the “I won’t do that to you” especially when the person she ended up dating a dude with a six pack and chiseled jaw. The stereotype that bigger dudes get left for. Like first off thanks, it was a nice shot of self confidence :).

There’s nothing wrong with having a type, but don’t go out doing shit like this girl did. 

It’s not cool at all to anyone that may be even thinking of it. Please just have some integrity or some respect for the people you’re talking to if you do OLD.

from my experience, tinder is the worse app to find relationships, I wonder how people get lucky, it's a 1/50 odds
Apart from the pervs and guys who would literally pretend to like you, mold their personality..just to get in your pants....

Every single human being I have met on there has commitment issues
Well date for 4/5 months and next thing, it's push and pull after you invest so much
And they won't tell you early on, they'll lead you on till they feel the pressure (even though I never brought up the talk) they're hot and cold

Also Tinder gives you a hard blow to your self esteem, I have been considered good-looking but they always have options and it's like a 
""survival of the most attractive"" thing


....And hypothetically you find someone who want what you want
either they're dealing with something mentally 
(BP, BPD, etc)
and are unable to hold a relationship
THEN WHY ARE YOU ON THIS APP????

I’m a guy (22) seeing a girl (22) for a fourth date this weekend. We met on a dating app about a month or so ago. Neither of us have any real dating experience. This is only my second time dating (as in going on dates) and this is her first. We’re both very introverted and awkward (by our own admission) although she is more shy than I am. 

There is definitely chemistry. We both enjoy each other’s company and talk a lot. She initiated the fourth date (we’re going out for dinner) so I know she’s at least interested in me. 

But in terms of romance… not much. I’ve not kissed her yet, as I’ve been waiting for the right moment and I’m pretty anxious about it to be honest. I’m extremely confident she isn’t going to make the first move, so it’s up to me. 

I really do like her and I want to kiss her at the end our next date to at least test our romantic chemistry and to give our relationship the extra nudge… but I don’t know how to go about it. Should I ask her if I can kiss her? Should I just lean in to kiss her and see what happens? Should I give her a kiss on the cheek for now?

After the first date I felt like ok she’s pretty cool. Saw her two day later for a quick dinner. It wasn’t so long before we finally started the sex. I never thought about asking her what she was looking for , because I thought it would made her feel like I would be looking for hook up only . But one day we was taking about the sex and how she asked me if I was seeking another people , I told her no I rather be a one person man and I asked her if she is, she said have a fuck buddy before me but hasn’t spoke since the 3rd week we was seeing each other. So I decided to asked her what she was looking for. She said she not ready for a relationship or want to label it anytime sooner . I figured ok I should give her time because I also want to move things slow (even we had sex so fast ) however every time we met up it’s always we having sex (don’t ge the wrong it’s fun) but I told her I wanted something more than what we look like . She didnt answered my question but I didn’t bother repeating it. Fast forward to now it’s been like 4 months since we been “dating “ things been slow lately , conversation been dry , and she seem posting stuff on her ig story that made herself “single “ or something like she’s not interested. She even post a picture of us but none of our face was showing just hands holding. Also every time we hang out , it’s always seem like we have to hang out at places or we have to book a room to be together . She never once mentioned to invited me into her house once . My guts is telling me I should just leave her because my time would be wasted .

Ok so I (M24) have been talking to this girl (F21) for 2 months. We talk everyday until midnight and last week she came to visit my state and by extension me. I took her out for some dinner and hiking. I had the best time and she called me later that night and told me she shared my view of the day. We talked some more about seeing each other again and she was very keen on the idea.

All of a sudden she is replying really slow throughout the day and she cuts our conversation by evening saying goodnight. She removed her location on snapchat but is still active on other applications. I'm not stalking her or anything I noticed this by accident when I posted on my story and she viewed it hours after saying goodnight. I decided to ask her about her slow replies and she reassured me she cant reply as often because of work and school assignments.

So what is the thought process here? Why would she say goodnight but stay active talking to other people? Did she lose interest or am I still good? Share your thoughts please. Thank you reddit.

There were a number of things at play but I would definitely say trying recklessness on my part ended it. It was the first time I broke someone's heart and still struggle with the guilt that I felt for it.  I was plagued by consistent drug use (MDMA) 
over a long period of time had me very confused about life in general at the time, this was in 2017. 
I started dating someone else who helped me  patch my life back together. 
We dated until March 2020. 
Which ironically coincided with my highschool sweetheart stumbling back into my life. 

At first I think I only talked to her to check if after all those years I was in love with her, or the idea of her. 
And for a good 9 months I slowly fell back in love with this highschool sweetheart of mine. 
It was pure and felt so real. 
We slept together for the first time December 2020. Talked and saw each other on&amp;off through 2021 and officially started dating in November 2021. 
Now 4 months into it I'm not sure of things. 
I can feel myself detaching and I don't know how to fix this. 
And trust me I'm trying. 
At this point I'm honestly questioning whether I should even date. 
I hate hurting people, I have too much empathy. 
So the idea of someone's being hurt as a result of my actions kind of causes me to freeze. 

I know I love her, but idk if I'm in love with her. 
I feel like such a fake  person. 
Like here I am with someone who is genuinely amazing, kind-hearted, understanding and perhaps most importantly a great communicator.
Yet something is just not clicking for me.

Yo so I had this fwb that ended three months ago. Met him on an app. It was an undefined relationship but we were basically just hanging out and fucking. I caught feels (sigh) and had a breakdown and sobfest when he told me he was seeing others at the same time. Tbf that week I just lost my grandpa and was exhausted from work. He ended things cause he didn’t wanna hurt me. I tried to convince him to take me back but he thought I was in denial about my feelings. 



It’s been three months and I low key can’t believe I ever had a crush on him 😂 But his dick and tongue game was amazing and I wanna hit him up again. I’ve been going on dates and having casual sex. But none of them really panned out and no one has fucked as good as him. I rly wanna hit him up again or at least chill like old times. He’s going to be very hesitant to jump into a fwb situation if he thinks I still have feelings. I don’t but have no clue how to convince him since I had that sobfest 😬.

We went to a local pub/bar, and chatted for about 2h30, with very few pauses in conversation. We discussed our jobs, family, holiday wish-lists, Disney films, both went to the same uni...I think I did a bit more of the asking, but not in an OTT way - I had thought of a couple of things to ask beforehand, so when there was the odd pause I had something lined up. We both got a couple of minor laughs out of each other, plenty of smiles. I was aware of keeping my body language/voice positive, which I think I did. Kept making eye contact and reacting to what she was saying, whilst keeping an eye out tell-tale signs such as the classic hair-tuck-behind-the-ear (alas, no luck).

As it was my first date in a long while I told myself to focus on having a nice time, keeping conversation going, and not get too ahead of myself - I almost treated it as a practice/free hit (I don't mean that to sound derogatory). But as we said our brief goodbye (no physical touch), I realised that this method is all very well and good if you aren't too fussed about the person, but it was at that point I realised that I quite liked her, and I was suddenly disappointed and worried that I'd not done more to show it; it was an enjoyable, relaxed evening, but there wasn't anything particularly 'romantic' about it.

For the first couple of months, we were decent friends, not close or distant to each other, mainly texted over quarantine. In the beginning, I was attracted to her physical appearance and through texting, she was a little insensitive towards my feelings (She texted everyone the same way and we were only friends so I didn't care that much). We stopped texting for a while until she began attending my school.

Fast forward two years later, I had lost most of my feelings for her and we're pretty good school friends. We rode the same bus home most days of the week and had conversations for the entire duration of the ride. 

I generally gave her relationship advice, how to approach her boyfriend, why she had issues with her relationship, and how to approach it. I wasn't happy nor sad knowing that she was in a relationship, just glad that we had a reason to speak to each other. I'm not sure if she actually enjoyed our time together or if she just wanted someone to pass the time with. 

A few months after she broke up with her boyfriend, she stopped riding the bus as often with me (She took the same bus so she could meet her boyfriend). Recently, I started to develop feelings for her  because the empty seat besides me had made me realize how much I missed her presence. 

Throughout the entire time, I don't think she never took initiative to develop a deeper friendship (I'm pretty sure she did, but the way I came off was rude and childish). 

The past couple of days, I could see her becoming more distant with me, almost avoidant. The casual greeting that we usually gave each other was non-existent (I usually look her in the eye and say hello but it felt like she purposely looked somewhere else)

Yesterday, she asked me why I chose to spend my bus rides with her instead of my numerous friends laughing at the back. Confused, I responded with the fact that I liked talking her (subtle hint that I was interested in her). I can't describe the look on her face during the conversation, but it felt like my world was going to crash if I responded with my normal BS.

Today I asked her, ""are you avoiding me?"" to which she responded with ""you're overthinking it."" I'm not sure if I am overthinking it but I'm very confused on how I should approach our relationship. I do want to get into a relationship with her, but I'm also very confident that if she doesn't like me, our friendship might take a toll or even end.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, my possible options are to 

1. Ignore everything and not tell her how I feel (I feel like if I don't do anything our friendship will end since we only have verbal conversations)
2. Tell her I like her and ask her on a date (With the way she's recently been acting, this also might not end well for me. I have confidence issues so it's easier said than done to pretend nothing happened if I get rejected)
3. (Extremely ambitious) Since I am going to college next year, our time together is limited (Verbal communication). I could tell her how I feel years later if I still feel the same (Based on the conditions surrounding me, I think this is the best possible option long term, but it kinda hurts seeing you like come and go)

when we got out of the bar we walked a little bit and then we kissed, we both enjoyed it so we sat on a fountain and started making out. after a while, he then made a horoscope joke saying something like 'my venus is in leo which some people say means i'm very good in bed', i laughed and said something like 'can your exlovers verify so?, what are your reviews like?' and then he asked me about mine. at that point i simply dropped the bomb that i was a virgin. he acted super shocked saying that he would have never thought of that and asked me a lot of questions about it (why? if i wanted to lose it? if i even tho had sex drive? etc) now i think about it and maybe something about my responses put him off a little bit or something. anyway, we continued kissing until he told me it was late and he worked the following day so we said our goodbyes, but acted so sweet and caring, with a lot of intimate touching, holding hands, hugging me from behind, kissing my hand and cheek, etc. after parting our ways i told him 'i think i shared with you too many stuff' obvs referring to my virgin situation and he answered 'i'm sure that bothers you more than me' so i got home feeling really nice and got even happier when i saw a goodnight text from him saying he had a lot of fun. 

the following morning i made a joke about something we talked about on our date and chatted a little bit. then, two days later i texted him that i wanted to see him and also pay for that second date we already talked about. he kindly agreed and we decided the day. the morning of the day we were suppossed to meet i asked him if we were still good to meet and then he simply answered that he couldn't. he didn't say why, he didn't try to reschedule, and tbh i found a little bit sad that he didn´\`'t tell he could not see me sooner. i simply texted back with okay and we have not chatted since then. this happened two weeks ago. i srsly thought after him being the one canceling on the date, he would reach out again to reschedule but he hasn't. thinking about it, before the date, he did 70% of the chasing, and after the date i was the only one reaching out. this experience has led me to a lot of questions...

\-why did he chang his mind so damn quick about me??? did my virginity had something to do about it??? is the only reason i can think of. 

\-should i try to reconnect with him or am i gonna make a fool of myself??? 

feel free to answer to whatever question you like, i feel kinda lost, i know 2 weeks have already passed, maybe a lot of you are going to say that i should just move on, but i really like this guy and the situation didn't close properly so that makes me feel super weird, and bc i've been hurt in the past i don't want to feel rejected.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163751,public,self,Did he lovebomb me? / Is he pulling back after I told him i'm a virgin? / Do I give him another chance?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/tf3w95/did_he_lovebomb_me_is_he_pulling_back_after_i/,no_ads,0.0,,

He was tall, hot, dominant, and the first guy I ever loved. He had the rare bad boy personality and handsomeness that I really want in a guy.

Well he moved in last summer to a shared house with me and although he had a girl over a couple of times, he told me they were just friends. I checked his social media and saw pictures of them at the beach, in matching Halloween costumes, etc. but when I asked him if a girlfriend, he said they were broken up and now just friends.

About 2 months in he asked me to our pub, bought me drinks, dinner, and was just SO sweet and charming. Then he asked me to cuddle in his room and I ran in and did it out of joy. It was the best night of my life...a high I'll never experience again I fear. We did this a couple nights and he tried to sleep with me, however, I told him that I wasn't ready and wanted to get to know him better.

Another week goes by and that SAME blonde girl that had been over a bunch of times during the first couple months was back. I was devastated. He said she was just in the area so that's why he had her over. Then again a couple weeks later she was in HOSPITAL, and only then did he invite me into his bedroom to cuddle again. 

I happily ran in because I missed that high I got the first few times, but then I confronted him about having a girlfriend. He asked me to cuddle. I asked her how she would feel about us cuddling, he said he wouldn't tell us.  So I loudly said NO, we're not cuddling, you know it's wrong"", and we just awkwardly laid next to each other and I couldn't hold a conversation. I probably seemed like an uptight loser.

And after that, he backed off and I'm afraid it's all my fault for being so unfriendly and cold. This blonde girl eventually started coming over 3 nights a week, 4 nights a week, and eventually every night, and they were having sex in the room next door to me. He even took her to a wedding and on a tropical vacation. It really screwed with my mental health so I moved out.

It's been 3 weeks since I moved out but I still miss this guy terribly. He is the best-looking, most fun guy to be around in the world. Please give honest advice, would it be okay if I contacted him? Will he ever contact me again if they break up? I just never experienced that rush of emotions I felt when he held me and I want him to be mine so bad.

But I have dark memories of being in this modern world of so-called “dating.” Dating is supposed to be fun but it was a nightmare. Nothing but people just wanting to sleep with you before knowing you. Wanting suggestive pictures of you before even seeing your face in person. Wanting intimacy before even knowing each other’s birthdays for crying out loud!  I never got to go on any actual dates until I met my now husband, who actual was one of my close friends, because as soon as these guys found out I wouldn’t tell them what I was wearing, send them pics, or sleep with them, they disappeared.  Good riddance. If they didn’t want to date me, get to know me first, before having an intimate relationship, they weren’t worth my time. Eventually I stopped searching. Good thing I did. Because my person was right there in front of me the whole time. And he did want to court me. He did want to get to know me. We were both very much on the same page that we wanted emotional intimacy before physical. Something that appears to be rare these days. 

What ever happened to actually enjoying the slow process of getting to know someone?   Actually wanting to know them, as the person they are.  Whatever happened to not sleeping with someone until there is an actual emotional bond there?  Some trust?  You cannot trust someone you just met.  I can’t imagine being that exposed to someone who is basically a stranger. That sounds terrifying and dangerous. You don‘t know what he/she is capable of, what their actual plans are, what they might have.  And you’re just going to give them a very intimate photo of you?  Sleep with them?    


Color me confused. But I just do not get it.  What is so wrong with courtship? Why do so many people call it “old fashioned” and ”outdated?”  If you like someone don’t you want to actually…know them?  Don’t you want to know what makes them who they are?  Do you care?  Or is it just about hopping right to the intimate stuff right away?  And if that is so, how can anyone want to be intimate physically before mentally and emotionally?

G and I had a lot in common and got along very well. He worked opposite shifts as me and we didn't spend a lot of time together. He is a very independent person and I am too but still enjoy quality time together that I felt we didn't get. We fell apart, I started seeing someone else for a little over a year and we split. 

Now E is back in my life. 

We had kept in touch from time to time. We still talk like we didn't skip a beat. He has a new job now a very good one and we are able to spend and see one another on weekends. We have been doing this for about a month now but no relationship boundaries have been designated. 

I don't expect him to rush. Based on how we fell apart before despite him saying he has no grudges and things happen I'm sure he is still skeptical to date again. He hasn't had a lot of relationships and the ones he did have lasted a couples years at a time. He is very mature and has his life together, we have similar hobbies, he always tells me how good company I am. 

Lately we spend a night together on the weekends and do things together.. but are not dating yet. We date, sleep together, all of that. He is very open and honest about things and is incredibly social.

I can and do force myself to ask out girls that I know are attractive even if I dont feel anything, but as you can guess, they turn me down. Probably because they can tell that I am not truly into them that way.

Anytime I see her working out it just gives me so much energy because she is always lookin like a snack tbh (I literally, consciously, have to avoid chronically glancing at her, overriding my ape operating system).

Since I said hi, we have been glancing at each other a bit, but I never really go over since the gym is packed, and I workout pretty intense, like very intense, singing along to my music in my own world…

I have been doing 2x a day lifting workouts for the past month and I have been pretty sapped. Today was leg day and I really felt down, things have felt like a chore (but it really does wonders, but that’s another post).

I got on the exercise bike for my warm-up, and 5 minutes in wanted to not be there at all. I started breaking a sweat, then I see her come out of the locker room, and I’m like, so reenergized, it is hard to describe, she is always just looking so attractive (and we haven’t worked out at the same time in 1-2 weeks).

The workout goes great, we glance at each other a good bit, doing the whole mirror deflection game thing, her first, me first (we all know). Annnnnd, yeah.

After my workout I got inspired to make this post. I think she is dating this hot MMA dude at my gym (who I’d date tbh) so I have just been like distant and haven’t approached her again…she is probably just like curious…and knows she is cute…

He also said my lifestyle does not work because I’m in the military and in nursing school despite him knowing this information since we met and him explicitly saying before he was okay with it. 

I tried so hard communicating to him. I wanted to talk things out in person so I can get a peace of mind and debate on whether the friendship is even worth it. He failed to communicate to me what was bothering him even though I asked. He says he wants to trust people but how are people supposed to trust him when he does this? I mentioned him things that bothered me (leaving my apt to smoke weed, not communicating to me, always putting me on hold). He proceeded to tell me I’m not the only one in his social circle, that he didn’t get to talk to other girls since he has been hanging out with me (this wasn’t even remotely any part of conversation). He dodged a lot of questions (whether he used me for sex, etc) 

I’m not bothered by the fact that this did not work out romantically; im bothered that he thrown so much out at me at one sitting AT 4AM. That night I did not sleep. I want to make things right to him and show him I care. I feel like such a bad person. This has damaged a lot of my self-worth. When I expressed that I wanted to talk in person about it, he called me over dramatic and said he just wanted to clarify that we were never dating (even tho there was obvious couple shit lmfao) Maybe this is just his true colors.

Honestly it’s the weirdest question any man has ever asked me. I’m not sure if it’s an ego thing or if he was just curious. 

Of course I tried to tactic-fully ignore the question but he insisted on an answer. I tried explaining to him that since it’s the beginning stage of our relationship my “rating” of him won’t be accurate and could change. For me having sex with someone I’m in love with or have been dating for a longer time will “rate” higher than a new person. Excellent sex for me doesn’t just include the physical aspect but it’s also has mental and emotional components so the closer I am to you the better the sex will be hence a higher rating.

Look, after years of being alone, I genuinely want to try to date again, and I even want to have a family of my own. However, I do not have--and in some cases don't ***want*** to have--the traits that many women look for in a man. My worries, insecurities, and lack of confidence have led to me posting here several times (Much to my embarrassment) and not making any efforts to get out there and try to date.

&amp;#x200B;

For starters, I'm short at 5'6. I am aware that tall men are preferred because they make many women feel small and protected. I also know that some women out there don't care as long as I am taller than they are, and that some don't care about height AT ALL. Hell, I even met a 5'4 guy and his infant daughter in a damn Target! However, being tall is still considered highly attractive by many women out there. I'm normally not insecure about my height, but knowing this fact really, *REALLY* makes me worry about my prospects.

&amp;#x200B;

The second thing I worry about is that I don't have the instinct to be a protector. Many men like to feel like a strong protector for women in their lives, even if they are only doing something as simple as opening a tight jar. I never had that, and this even extended to my taste in women. Like I said in my spammy questions, I've always been attracted to physical strength, fighting skill, muscle, and even *tallness* (5'6 and up, though not a requirement) in women. Basically, my ideal woman (likely) does ***NOT*** need me at all. The problem is, many women want to feel protected, which sucks when I don't have the instinct to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, I'm not dominant. I've never been interested in that or being a leader. While I am a switch in the bedroom, I pretty heavily lean towards being submissive. And in a relationship, I don't really like the thought of being a leader. I'd rather my girl and I have equal power, or ideally, SHE is the dominant one. Problem? Many women want their man to wear the pants (though there are some who don't mind having equal power). One who actually wants to be the dominant one is damn near like finding a needle in a haystack.

&amp;#x200B;

So here are all of my fears, doubts, and insecurities laid bare. I want to try dating, but I'm terrified to try because I'm not the dominant, protective, tall man that many women love. Am I wrong to be so doubtful? Or should I make efforts to be more masculine and dominant?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163767,public,self,I'm (24M) terrified to try my hand at dating because I am not a dominant man.
