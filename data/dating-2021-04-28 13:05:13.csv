If you know you deserve better, you wont entertain the people who give you half assed responses, who flake, who keep you as their backup, who ghost then come back, and all the other multitude of shitty things people do. The quicker you cut them off, the less time you waste on them and the closer you are to findings someone you deserve.

How do you learn to deserve better? By loving yourself. Truly loving yourself.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n0lnbm/you_accept_the_love_you_think_you_deserve/
2,n0lrr2,1619635559,Bring up hanging out or give him space? (FWB),"We have been talking for 4 months. Mostly a potential fwb situation. Had plans to meet 2 days after talking but he caught covid..skip a month ahead..he gets called right back to work. Then work gets busy, we have a plan to meet in his car but then he comes home late and ends up telling me he’s pretty nervous getting caught by the cops. He lives with his brother, had a basement to himself..says we could meet there late at night one night..we continue talking everyday..turns out he has the place to himself..we have a set date, then my car gets repossessed..get it back a few days later and he still has the place to himself and then i realized how badly my penis was chafed (friction burn from jerking off). he says it’s cool, and he’s not going anywhere. Fast forward 2 weeks, it’s healed. He has an international delegation at work to host for 2 weeks..13 hour days, no talks about meeting up..less texts, i do mention “if u still want to meet, ill make sure to give a bear hug”..since he’s working so much, he says “definitely. i’ll need it” His crazy 2 weeks is over, says he finally has a day to relax and sleep in, that morning he ends up rushing to his grandmas 5 hours away..she doesn’t have much longer. This was 9 days ago, he is still at his grandmas. Texting less but he’s still keeping me updated for the most part. When he goes back home, he’ll probably have to work longer hours, and he’ll be grieving the death of his grandma..but i’m not sure where me and him stand, and if he is still interested in meeting..do i bring it up to him that i’m still open to it, or give him space?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n0lrr2/bring_up_hanging_out_or_give_him_space_fwb/

4,n0lxj8,1619636006,Any other way of meeting women outside of dating apps?,"The other day I was hanging with my tight knit group of friends, of which I am the only single guy left within the group.  There I was, sitting and hanging with a group of couples while I, the runt of the litter at this point, was just kind of hanging there.  I became super depressed the next day at how alone and out of place I felt.  I don't even want to hang out with my closest friends now because it just triggers this feeling of sadness and lonliness I have.  Now whenever I'm hanging with a buddy of mine, they usually have to spend some time talking to their gal or have to cut things short to go hang with them.  

So I did what any sad and lonely buffoon would do and loaded up the dating apps again.  Paid for a 3 month subscription to okcupid like an idiot, although for guys this is literally the only chance you have at matching with anyone, and started ""playing the numbers game"" as so many of my friends put it when giving me advice.  Now it's just sunk me into a deeper hole than ever before.  I'm checking the app CONSTANTLY to see if I match with anyone or if anyone messages me back and even when I acknowledge what I'm doing, I'm still just quickly checking it when I have some downtime.

At this point, I really don't know what to do.  I've asked my friends and their gfs before if they know anyone and they always just tell me, ""sorry but everyone I know is taken.""  It's so hard to go out and find people these days and even if I was just allowed to walk into a bar and chat a girl up, my social anxiety makes the action of doing that so difficult.  Everyone at my job is either married or too old for me and hitting up people at the workplace isn't really kosher anyways.  I've tried the whole, go and participate in something you enjoy to meet somebody, but that's never worked for me too.  Dating apps are toxic as fuck and barely work but I don't know what else to do at this point to find someone.  I've been told time and time again that I'm a very attractive person with a very kind and welcoming personality.  I've recently lost a TON of weight just so I could look more attractive and feel more confident, but this dating thing is really taking a toll on my well being.  I've taken breaks from it, I've spent time to focus on myself and what I want in life, and yet I still have this dreadful feeling of loneliness that I can't do anything about.  Worst of all is that it feels impossible to talk about this with anyone in my friend group because all they do is tell me that I have to ""keep at it"" or ""take a break"" which is real bullshit advice that's easy to give when you're in a happy relationship.

So I don't know, is there any other way to meet someone or put myself out there outside of these manipulative dating services?  Being this lonely is really taking a toll on my mental health and if I stop to take a break, I just feel like I'm letting more time slip away from me...

TL;DR: Severely lonely guy wants to know how to meet someone outside of dating apps or getting hooked up through mutual friends?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n0lxj8/any_other_way_of_meeting_women_outside_of_dating/
5,n0lyxp,1619636111,I'm obsessed with this girl and I don't know how to stop,"
In 2018, I met a girl and I just find her really attractive. To the point I'd have dreams of us dating and spending time together...

At the end of the semester, I said that I could go for a drink, and she said that she doesn’t drink. I then said that I could use some coffee around the finals . She smiled. I said that we should grab some coffee after her finals. She just smiled and entered a building . I don't think she agreed, but how do I get over her?

She was friendly to me in person and smiles at me.

I tried to ask out other girls but they rejected me. 

I also didn’t find her on social media until today and say on her timeline that she started a relationship in May 2016. However, I didn’t see any likes on her photos (which she just uploaded on Saturday), and when I clicked on her “about”, it didn’t say anything about a relationship with ANYONE. One of her photos is a group gathering at Disneyland at night but I can’t see her or any possible boyfriend or friends or family members in it. Does her relationship status really mean she’s taken or no? She probably would’ve scrubbed it when uploading photos on Saturday but I didn’t see any relationship status in her “about” in her profile. 

How can I learn to forget about her completely from my life (especially since I graduated) and learn to move forward, since I don’t have any opportunities to meet and date new women now due to pandemic? Even before, I barely know how to get to know women on a deeper /non professional level and I want to know how to successfully seduce them and get them in bed with me",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n0lyxp/im_obsessed_with_this_girl_and_i_dont_know_how_to/

The main one (for me) is the prep that it takes for a woman to get ready for a date. I'm a very low-maintenance kind of girl in everyday life, however; when I have a date, I want to put in extra effort and that means doing extra things like putting on makeup, straightening my hair (which takes at least an hour), maybe doing a face/hair mask etc...also, my leg hair grows crazy fast so I always want to shave before hand, any italian girls out there? (if i don't have time to and the guy wants to get...""intimate"", I'll say I want to keep my clothes on. If only he made the plan earlier, I would be more likely to let him touch my legs :P).

This is my biggest qualm with last minute plans, but moreover, it makes me think you're not that interested in dating me or dating anyone for that matter. If you really care about going out with a girl. make the plan a couple days in advance and actually pick a time, not just ""I'll call you tomorrow and we'll figure it out"", ideally it would be ""I will pick you up at X time"" or ""I'll meet you at X place place at x time"".

No one like to live with regrets or wonder what the future may hold when you can get the answer's now!!! Cheating shows a lack of morality, it is a mindset that is created and shaped from early childhood. It shows opportunistic traits. It demonstrates a lack of intrinsic moral fibre. It shows that the person thought so little about their partner that they then made a calculated decision to have sex with someone else. So the reason it is once a cheater always a cheater is because you cant change the nature of a snake.
To be honest cheating starts with a message. It's why i recommend that people seek the truth before it gets too late.

19,n0nahp,1619639748,Heartbroken friend (35F) wants to get married and have kids: continues to stay loyal to her ex while pursuing dead end options! Help!,"I met K (35F) in nursing school. K has many good qualities: smart, resilient, kind, attractive and in great  shape. After living with C (37M) for a year; C promptly broke up with K and said it wasn’t personal, he needed to work on himself. C claimed that a future together was possible, however six months have passed and K has only seen him once. During their meet up he said K “didn’t give him the chance to miss her,” amongst other unpromising remarks. K called me crying and said C still needs more time to figure himself out. It’s been months and he hasn’t contacted her since.

Here’s the dilemma: I know my friend K really wants to get married and have kids in the near future. This week, K consulted a psychic about her relationship with C. According to the psychic, C will come back around and K has taken this as fact. I (23F) validated her feelings but I’m not nearly as optimistic, so I encouraged K to keep her options open. Around the same time as K, I went through a really rough break up and empathize with how she is feeling: undervalued, insignificant, kept at arms length, unloveable, etc. Since we’re both single, we made profiles on hinge together. The difference is, I’ve made an effort to actually move on and understand why my relationships all had similar outcomes. In an effort to help, I sent K a million and two resources and attempted to lead by example. I’ve been avoiding red flags that I previously overlooked and even review profiles with her! 

Being discerning is one thing, but being ridiculously picky is another. She refuses to expand her horizons, then throws in the towel and starts panicking about her future. She hasn’t read a single thing I’ve sent and the only guy K intends on going out with from hinge is a WALKING RED FLAG!! She is shooting herself in the foot: pursuing life long bachelors who have different goals; while staying loyal to her ex who is wasting her time!  **At this point, K is contradicting herself and blatantly going against her own best interests.

29,n0ojz0,1619643228,My closeness with my cousin is scaring away other women! [NSFW],"My (M) dating life has been pretty up and down these past few years. I have no problem landing dates, I go on quite a lot actually. And the girls like me well enough, but anytime the topic of my cousin (F) comes up, girls lose all interest, and some even react angrily.

It used to be that it was catching my girlfriends off guard. I would brace them before-hand ""just so you know, my cousin and I are a lot closer than normal cousins. Like we're more touchy, and it can sometimes look like flirting, but it's not, it's just the way we grew up."" They seem cool with that at first, thank me for telling them. But then if we go up to my cousin's cottage, they freak out when they see just *how* close I meant. Like one of my ex's left to go to bed, and my cousin and I cuddled on the couch while watching a movie. My ex walked out of her room and saw me rubbing my cousin's leg, and my hand resting on her stomach underneath her shirt, and she flipped the fuck out! Broke up with me as soon as we got home!

Another time I brought another girl up my cousin's cottage, and this girl left to go on a fourwheeler ride with some other guy there, so it was just my cousin and I. She was complaining about her body being sore all over, so I offered to give her a massage (I'm excellent at massages). So she stripped down and laid face down on her bed while I massages her. Eventually the two returned and the girl I brought walked into the room. I guess she didn't like that I was massaging my cousin's ass at the time (and I also had my shirt off because it was summer), because she started crying.

So now I started telling women I'm seeing right at the start about the extent and details of how close I am with my cousin. They all act disgusted and some have even thrown things as me. What do I do? How can I make it so women don't react so angrily over this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n0ojz0/my_closeness_with_my_cousin_is_scaring_away_other/

But not to get off topic i always questioned myself when we talked just by some of the responses from her. Always kept telling myself i shouldn't of said that or took a while to reply. Sometimes i wish i could just start all over with her. After everything in that short time...  Haven't talked in a few days but she is always still checking  on my social media's insta and snap.

It feels like we just missed out on something after went our separate ways. I'm just a little lost and not understanding on why she had a sudden change of heart.

31,n0oo7p,1619643580,Anyone ever feel constantly on edge/insecure about their relationships?,"I’m 23 year old male currently attending dental school (weeks away from finishing my first year). I met a girl who lives in my building for the past few months, she’s 21 and will be here until August (she’s from Europe and is doing a lab placement). 

In general, we have a good relationship, though sometimes she can be too honest (I take a lot of pride in the artwork I make in my free time, and she called one of my favorite sketches “nothing that impressive”). I spoil her a lot, and she doesn’t reciprocate as much. Also, there is a crazy guy in his mid 30s who definitely has a drinking problem that slid creepy flirtatious notes under her door with his cell phone number on it. I texted the guy twice to leave her alone, and he threatened to kill me and tried to square up with me a couple weeks ago. I had to call the police on him, and he’s been quiet since being scolded by two officers. 

My girlfriend’s parents got mad at me for texting the guy, even though I was just trying to protect her (I’m glad I found out this guy is nuts because I’d much rather have him upset with me than her). However, I am scared of living in my building. I can barely leave my room and use the common area. When I’m in the hall, and I hear someone coming up the stairs, I dart to my room and lock the door. I even have to carry around pepper spray with me when I go to the shared bathrooms. Though my girlfriend did take my side when her parents told her to dump me...they’re fine with me now. 

This past week, I’ve been trying to hang out with my girlfriend, but she says she’s been too busy/too tired. Also, school has been rough this past week (middle of the quarter is usually the drudge). I seriously bust my butt to finish my work on time so I can destress and also make time for her, but she keeps blowing me off.

After she blew me off last night, I just got really stressed and now am even feeling physically ill/trying not to break down crying. I also am on edge because of this knucklehead on my floor (he left a racist message directed at another resident last week in the bathroom). School sucks too, just had a rough day in lab — we’re given half the time because of covid restrictions. 


I seriously don’t like how my life is right now. I’m looking to move, but it’s super expensive. My girlfriend and I seem to be on the same page about our relationship expiring in August, and we want to make the most of the time we have together. She has been acting somewhat jealous recently as she saw me messaging some of my female friends/classmates. She even wanted me to prank some of them and send them something flirtatious because I have to “replace” her, in her words.

If you are one of those guys who can't get any matches or dates, it is because of one of two reasons:

1. You are unattractive. If that's the case, you need to lower your standards and date women who are also unattractive.
2. You are bad at presenting yourself, are boring, come across as bitter, etc. If that's the case, you need to work on yourself.

Issue is, I'm not sure what to do for a second date. The weather has suddenly turned rainy for the next 2 weeks (every day), so not much chance of outdoors (I was originally planning on taking her to play tennis) - she'd mentioned she has played it in the past, and I'd like to try - has to be pushed back for a sunnier day down the line.

Do you lot have any date ideas? (She's really shy - even me holding her hand flustered her - cutest shit ever, but anyway)

I was thinking maybe watching a movie at my place and ordering Pizza. (I'm an artist and she mentioned wanting to see my drawings) but thats too boring and usual.

It wasn’t a good relationship by any measure, I’d never really been in any kind of relationship like that before and they’d been in at least 3 or 4 prior ones, one of which produced two now teenage children. I was happy and excited at first and didn’t realize initially what it would be like moving forwards and boy did I not expect what would happen. 

It turned out they’d only wanted to “be with me” as I was getting financial support from my father an they’d seen that as a way to get money or good from me under the false promise of intimacy and spending time together, which never actually occurred despite my continued helping them, eventually I’d grown tired of being expected to do things and being manipulated that I said enough was enough and ended it, this repeated itself about half a dozen times before just recently ending once and for all.

55,n0rg80,1619651741,"Confused, Tired and Discouraged, looking for advice (31M)","Hello, I don't typically do this but I'm in a particularly low mood and don't really know what else to do. I am beginning to feel like I'll never meet a person that actually understands and wants to be with me for who I am. I am a 31 M, living in Brooklyn. I've never necessarily felt like I cannot attract attention or that I'm undesirable but I always seem to attract people that are ultimately very unhealthy for me emotionally or judge me and my lifestyle in a way that feels unfair.

I live very simply and I guess I am very passionate about what I do. I was formally a Chef for 10 years and have been a working artist for just about as long, I am a musician/writer/filmmaker amongst other things. Since Covid started I've hunkered down with my art and it's gone much better then I expected. I'm getting a lot of work writing music for friends projects and I am also working a potential television project as a band leader and producer. I'm also beginning my own business with a friend and it is also going better then I could hope for. I tend to spend most of my time working on music, practicing or studying.

I also like to take care of myself. I go to the gym almost every day. I like to make nice meals for myself. I drink a lot of water. I don't really drink very much alcohol and don't smoke cigarettes. A lot of this is recent as well, for the longest time I didn't take care of myself properly and would abuse my body. I am an enthusiastic weed smoker and occasionally I'll do hallucinogenics, hehe.

So this brings me to my larger point I suppose. For the first time in my life I am deeply happy, excited and content with myself and how I'm living after years and years of self loathing and mistreating myself. That being said, it feels like every woman I meet either is overwhelmed, confused or feels the right to judge me super harshly for having made it out of a difficult upbringing without being a shitty dude. I grew up very poor in New York and Latin America, never had the chance to go to college and have never really had a safety net of any kind at all. I am a total autodidact. Everything I've ever been able to do or anyway I've been able to live has been out of a lot of struggle. I always find myself having to playdown my happiness or apologizing for being optimistic about my future. I also find a lot of time when I try to graze over myself and focus more on their story I find that people become disinterested. It always seems like at first people are excited by the novelty of the idea of who I am but when they poke and prod and I'm honest about who I am and my past and how I live now, it always seems like the date can't end fast enough. I usually just feel like a giant freak after dates.

There's also a part of me that thinks a lot of it is also because of how I look but I don't want to believe that. I believe I am handsome and have a nice body (I'm not overweight and am lo key muscular, lol). A part of me feels like it's because I'm short (5'6) and not white (I'm Colombian). I really don't want to believe that but it feels that way... it's probably just the depression talking.

I don't know. I'm at my wits end and just feel super discouraged and just sad. I'm not sure what to expect out of this but I just really wanted to get this off of my chest. I feel like I've just been suffering in silence not really knowing what to do with myself. I have a fear of just giving up and becoming a hermit that just works on music all day and never socializes outside of playing shows. I just want to feel accepted and cared about...

If you read this, I really appreciate that you spent the time to sit through my inconsequential problems and complexes. Hope you have a great day!

I didn't think much of it at the time, just thought it was one of those things girls do to have fun.

Now that I'm dating again and using dating apps I hate how much I see all these filters being used in every single pic. And those are just the ones I can spot! 

What's worse is I just recently went on a date with someone who must have photoshopped all their pics and when I said I don't recognize them they looked confused as to why... 

How can being deceitful from the start of the relationship work in your favor at all? It makes absolutely no sense to me. This may sound harsh but work on your mental health. How is this behavior normalized or tolerated? This isn't some online game avatar you're creating, it's supposed to be you.

I hate how social media has normalized this and even encouraged it. It's annoying from a dating point of view sure but the repercussions this must have on the younger generations mental health... it's just sad to think about.

70,n0spr7,1619655858,Matched with ex lovers brother on tinder :/,"Hi

So long story short. I spent the night with this guy I used to work with over a year ago now... we had worked together for a while and I was in love with him.

That night we  both said we loved each other. Pls note we didnt actually have sex. just slept in the same bed and made out etc..

Then he never talked to me again. It really went south after he cut me off. I started going out drinking every weekend and calling him. He blocked my number. I was severely depressed..

Now I  discovered the guy ive been talking to on tinder is actually his brother and they live together (from looking at his ig profile) . I actually really like  this guy and dont want to blow it if its not already messed up as it is.

I thought he might have known about me and we were both talking together knowing about my history with his brother. I thought that maybe his bro would have told him? But now im not sure if he has any clue...

Should I tell him and see what he says before I meet him? (If he doesnt block me)

72,n0tdib,1619658179,Was he actually interested in dating or just hooking up?,"I Matched with a guy on hinge back in March and after a few weeks of texting every few days, we finally made plans. We walked around a park and got dinner at a restaurant that he chose. The date went well and ended with a kiss. 

Last weekend, I had a second “date” with him and we got dinner (he chose the restaurant again). After dinner, he asked if I wanted to go his place to “hangout” and I said yes. At first, we were just watching a movie and cuddling, which led to us making out on the couch. At one point, he asked if I wanted to move to the bedroom and I said “I think we’re fine here” because I wasn’t ready to have sex with him yet. He didn’t seem annoyed at all and I stayed for another hour before I left to go home. Literally as I was walking out the door, he pulled me towards him and we had a quick make out session before finally left.

Since then, he hadn’t reached out until I texted him today asking how he was. He responded, which I guess is a good sign. However, I asked him if wants to get drinks this weekend and haven’t heard back.

He’s kind of confusing me because there was definitely a connection between us, at least physical for sure. But he’s being spotty with texting, which isn’t normal based on our previous convos.

Also, the guy they hooked up with and later had feelings for was their “guy best friend ex-FWB” that always told my partner how much they disliked me while we were going out and they always told me not to worry about him. After stopping talking for a couple weeks they blocked me on everything. Anyway, the advice I’m looking for. I’ve never been the guy to only want sex, but after all that I’m terrified to have a relationship that’s anything more than sex.

78,n0tq04,1619659389,"First time getting hit with the ""I might just wanna be friends."" Can't shake it, whether it was gonna be casual or serious, I like her.","So I'm in the parking lot of a bar, waiting in my car about to leave, waiting on the homies to come.

This girl walks up to my car and says ""Hey, you're cute"" I tell her she's cute too and she wanted to smoke weed with me at her place, I really would've but I was getting tired and one of my homies was passed out, so we exchanged info, and her friend did the same. We all exchanged info, my friend and I with these two girls.

She'll snapchat me and all that, text me as well. And I guess my friend and her went out once, and he told me it didn't work out. He found himself not really into her. 

She reaches out to me and she acknowledged and told me that she hoped it didn't weird me out that they went out. I didn't carry we just met and it was one date.

So she asked me out a few days ago and we go out and have an absolute blast. We danced and made out. We went out for food afterwards. She said she wanted me to go back to her place but since it was our first date she didn't wanna mess things up. She kept calling me cute and told me how she felt like she picked the right friend to go out with. She called me cute more times than I could count. Kept smiling and kissing me while doing so.

That same night she was the one to ask me out on a second date. The very next day.

But then yeah all of sudden the next day comes, we text and talk some and she just kinda went cold. Today she told me she was feeling like we should just friends. And yeah I told her I appreciate her honesty, but I also told.her I don't think we could be friends, she said she understands. And yeah that's the end of that I guess. She was just so cool though, fun, plays video games, full of energy and really pretty.

And it sucks because I think she might like my friend more, but then why tell me all that other stuff. Not to mention my homie has got some issues with his ex, he's got a lot going on with her, and I'd never trash talk him or anything, but yeah she's about to out herself in the middle of that.

For the last few weeks and up until the end of our date, she's been trying to get my friend and I to come to her birthday party at her place in Friday. 

He already said he can't go and yeah if she asks again, I'm not gonna be her second choice.

I guess at this point I'm just venting. It sucked being the last choice. It sucked that we had a great night, she called me cute and kept coming over to kiss me every five minutes, only to still be second yo my friend, who apparently doesn't even wanna go out with her.

It's also hella annoying because she still has me on her close friends on snapchat, where I know she'll post some thirst snaps. I haven't looked at them or given in.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n0tq04/first_time_getting_hit_with_the_i_might_just/
79,n0tuwr,1619659867,Im with this guy and he really likes me and i like him too but im not ready.,"Im (F19) in uni and I met this guy who's (M19) as well and we get along pretty well. Since covid happened, I've only been talking to a small handfull of people. He was one of them. We started talking through discord and we eventually got along pretty well. We would talk a lot and spend time playing games together. This happened for quite a while and we started to meet each other person. For me, I'm a very shy and awkward person when it comes to meeting people in person, even if I've talked to them online for a while. But when I met him, that didnt happened. We hit it off really well just meeting in person and he easily broke me out of my shell. Ever since then, we've hung out quite a while and would do activities together.

This was all going well until one day, we had an emotional talk. He told me that he liked me. I told him that I felt the same way...except I feel like I wasn't ready. 

And when I mean by ""not ready"" it's because I feel like I'm not mature enough to date. I feel like I'm still too naive and immature to understand what dating is like and to handle such a commitment. Not just that, i have a huge fear of a breakup. This was bc I lost some really good friends during HS and it really tore me apart. So I feel like it'll happen again if I got into a relationship and broke up, except it would feel even worse. I dont really like things like physically touch, intimacy, or even kissing. As of right now, those things seem really out of my comfort zone and I'm not ready for that kind of thing nor even the idea of it.  I never dated in my life and it's really hard for me to like someone. The first person I really liked took me 2yrs to like them and I held it in for about 5yrs. You could say I'm picky with who I like but to me, it's because I want to be safe and I have a difficult time knowing whether I like them or not. I have a hard time understanding between ""liking someone"" and ""someone who's a good friend/best friend"" because we do things that seem more than just friends.

I enjoy his company. A lot. We do a lot of things that couples would do but we're not dating. We're more like in this gray area between friends and dating. But right now, I'm struggling on what to do.

Yes, we have communicated and talked about the dilemma with him and he understands me. He says that it's okay for me to not know what I want right now and that it's not my fault for feeling unsure. He even said that he has very strong feelings for me and is willing to wait if he has to. Even if it means finding out that I might not like him or it might take too long, he choose to stick around.

I'm happy that he respects me and my insecurities when it comes to relationships but I feel guilty. There has been two occasions I talked about our situation to my friends and they say I'm just holding him hostage. But when I talk to him about it, he tells me that I'm not at fault and that even if that's true, he's holding himself hostage for sticking around. He even acknowledges the fact that nothing is granted in the future cause I didnt promise him a relationship or anything. But despite all that, he decides to keep these feelings for me. 

No matter how many times he tries to assure me, I always feel guilty. I feel like I'm the one holding him hostage. I even sometimes tell him that he could always find someone else bc I feel really bad that I could be possibly holding him down. He knows everything about my situation and how I feel and he decides to stay. I need help please. Is he right that it should be his fault for staying and I shouldn't feel guilty about it? Or am I really holding him hostage? I just want some insight on how I should feel about this, what to do, or how to relieve myself from this idea that I'm holding him hostage.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n0tuwr/im_with_this_guy_and_he_really_likes_me_and_i/

He did coke in front of me last week and it made me really uncomfortable. His friends offered me some and I refused. I didn’t feel pressured or anything, but I still felt uncomfy to be in that environment. And his friends seem to judge me a bit for not partaking in it with them, telling me to relax and let loose. I can’t imagine what would happen if they got caught and I was present. Should this be a dealbreaker? It’s definitely not something he’s going to change. He says he’s done it for a while. To me I would think occasionally would be OK, but he literally said he does it every time he goes out. And I know for a fact he goes out almost every single Friday and Saturday.

At the end of August she flew back to her home country; I was supposed to follow a month later. Visa complications meant I didn’t get there until early November instead of late September. She had been acting really cold and distant the last few weeks before I flew out to see her. When I arrived she hit me with the “ things feel weird between us and I don’t want to have sex just yet” This was a red flag/ Huge bummer for me since wed basically talked every day about how much we missed/wanted one another. I knew I wasn’t entitled to sex and that she was going through a rough time so I simply told her that was fine with me and I wanted her to feel comfortable. Whenever she was ready was okay with me. Well we basically spent a total of maybe 20 hours together over the next two weeks before she dumped me. Her exact words were “you’re not career focused enough for me”. All my close female friends told me that was just a line though. It infuriated me that I had spent all this time,money and energy to go see her and she treated me like a stranger and then dumped me. It broke my heart . I won’t lie, the first few weeks were rough but I got through it and started to move on with my life. I deleted all the pictures, unfollowed her on social media and started going on dates with girls who were more than happy to find out I was single again. Fast forward to yesterday: I get a text from my sister saying “you have to see this” and a link to a tiktok video (don’t crucify me). I click on it and it’s my ex’s account (apparently my ex had requested to follow my sister) and there’s a video of her painting what I believe to be us. There are a bunch of videos with different paintings that are eerily similar to me. The captions are all about love and “realizing you have a connection”. There’s even one captioned “I broke up with my bf” followed by a story VERY similar to ours.

91,n0urv8,1619663020,Guy I had been dating ghosted me for nearly a week and finally responded. Should I continue to pursue our relationship? Or cut my losses now?,"I (22f) had been dating this guy (28 m) for the past couple of months. After our first date, I wasn’t sure I wanted to see him again. He is a very rich and successful business man, but was pretty arrogant the very first time I saw him, being a bit rude to the waiter and spending extravagant amounts of money which turned me off at first. But after that date, he continued to ask me out until I finally said yes. 

Once I got to know him better, I saw the person he is underneath the front he puts up to everybody else. He is sensitive and emotional, he even cried in front of me one night revealing a lot about his past and losses he has been through he tells no one about. He revealed that his past trauma has led to his struggles with alcohol, cocaine use, and smoking cigarettes. While at first something like this would have pushed me away, I wanted to continue to support him and be there for him and pursue a relationship because I like the person he was inside. 

He can be quite rude and arrogant sometimes, expecting money to fix the smallest inconveniences. While it irritated me, I also was jealous he had such power and control over every aspect of his life. I feel as if he did have a bit of a power complex, not feeling like he should be expected to do things that other guys would do in a relationship, like pick a woman up for a date or walk her to her car at the end of the night. Whenever I asked him to do something like this, he would laugh or complain. But I was still drawn to him. 

I liked our deep conversations and that he revealed a side of himself to me that I don’t think anybody else typically sees. He is surrounded by people just like himself most of the time (rich and successful partiers). We continued to go on dates for the next two months after that but just this past week he ghosted me out of nowhere. I had spent the night at his house and left the next morning and he kissed me goodbye and said he would see me soon. I texted him once I got home and he replied, but then once I replied to him he never responded again. 

Then, he was on social media posting pictures all weekend on a boat with tons of girls and friends binging on alcohol. He even added me to his close friends list so I could be sure to see it... 

Five days later I still had heard nothing. I was confused and hurt. I saw a future with him and it was very nice to be with somebody who had such an exciting life involving fun events and activities and took me out to these amazing places that I would’ve never dreamed of going before. 

To my surprise he ended up responding yesterday after I sent one last text just letting him know what he was doing was hurtful... He said that we can continue seeing each other and talking, but that he’s very busy with everything going on in his life and didn’t think that he could give me the attention I seem to require... He also said he felt like I may have been trying to “change him” and that’s why he backed off. I acknowledged his response and thanked him but I don’t know if I should re-open this door. And I’m just confused because now I’m questioning everything I said and did even more. 

I don’t know if I should try to hang out with him this weekend and rekindle things, or if I should just leave it and cut my losses.

TL;DR: should I continue to pursue someone who ghosted me and then came back?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n0urv8/guy_i_had_been_dating_ghosted_me_for_nearly_a/
92,n0us00,1619663032,Boyfriend (36) always pay the bill (I'm 22 F),"Hello. I've been getting nervous about who pays the bill when I date my boyfriend. I'm 22 and he is 36. We usually go to fancy places and I get kind of nervous he is spending that money. Maybe I feel less awkward because I'm younger (I still have a good job). I don't know. He told me he likes being a ""gentleman"" ...and that feminist men are rats who don't want to pay the bill. 

Maybe he is just old fashioned? Also gifted flowers and dresses fancy. I agree with old fashioned views but I feel nervous about the situation.

He wants to go out for his birthday and I think I should pay the bill. I feel intimitaded by the fact he is older and spends more money. Just dont know how to communicate this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n0us00/boyfriend_36_always_pay_the_bill_im_22_f/

94,n0v1ph,1619664020,Prom date has a boyfriend?,"So basically last weekend a girl from school wanted me to take out one of her friends for senior prom, and said that the friend really wanted me to ask her out. I texted her that night and created a classic prom poster to give her on Monday, which she thought was funny. I bought tickets and the males in the group we created decided the activities that we would do this Saturday, which is when the dance is. Tonight I was looking at my date's instagram and BOOM! A post with her and a guy she's kissing. I thought it was no big deal since it was posted last year, but then I look up and she has a story highlights of the guy that was updated just 3 weeks ago. I texted her asking if that was her current boyfriend and she said yes. She asked why I asked and I said ""nothing"". In truth, this actually really really bothers me. Is it normal for people to just go to dances with people other than their boyfriend/girlfriend? This takes all the fun out of the event for me, since there is now a 100% chance that I will not see a second date with her. What do I do?

95,n0v7m0,1619664620,Is it worth pursuing this further? (25M),"I'll preface this by saying that I have extremely little experience with relationships/flirting/hookups etc, and getting any sort of attention online or otherwise is something that doesn't happen to me often.

I matched with a beautiful girl on Hinge on Monday, we talked for a day and she was clearly very interested and sending me long messages. She even greeted me the following morning to continue the conversation. I bit the bullet and asked her out Tuesday evening last minute, somehow she agreed and I met her that night.

Overall I initially thought it went well but I've been stressing over it ever since. I hadn't been on a date in a long time and I guess I missed a lot of her signals, I didn't really try and flirt with her or show any romantic intent. Although we talked for 3 hours, at the end of the date we split the bill and I just unceremoniously dropped her off at her house.

But she did give me her number. So I tried to talk to her on Wednesday after the date and while she's not ghosting me, she doesn't seem super interested any longer. The messages are short and to the point and she takes ages to reply. I feel like crap, I can't sleep, my appetite is gone. It feels so pathetic to feel like this over one below-average date, but I can't help it.

I've thought about asking her to go for a walk in the park across from her house, and either have an open and honest conversation about the date the other night, or perhaps just hang out and give it another shot. In my opinion I've already fumbled most of my chances, so it's worth a shot just to see if she goes for it. It's a long shot to think there's anything to salvage there, but at least I'd have some sort of closure if she would just admit to me that she's not interested instead of stringing me along.

Should I try and see her again or am I just punishing myself? Should I just cut my losses and move on? I fucking hate feeling this way. How do people do this to themselves on the regular??",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n0v7m0/is_it_worth_pursuing_this_further_25m/
96,n0v8qz,1619664741,How to find out if a guy is single without directly asking?,"So there’s somebody I see every day but we don’t text, like idk if we’re both just too shy to ask each other for phone numbers or what. Every day that I see him, we always joke around and have good conversations. We always make a lot of eye contact when we aren’t talking and we’re both doing different things. Whenever it’s time to leave we usually do fist bumps but now we do side hugs. I want to find out if he’s single subtly before I attempt to flirt with him because I don’t want to disrespect him/anything he has going on with somebody else, but then again he gives me side hugs so either his gf is really cool or he’s single and I just don’t wanna directly ask that lol. I asked him before what he does when he goes home and he said he just sleeps.

We have been dating for almost 5 months now. I see myself with her and I really love her but the distance sucks and the chance of us meeting is hard. At least rn since she is still a high school student and I am on my way to my first year of uni. Our relationship till now is a secret because our parents would never accept the distance. Any advice?

99,n0vd7d,1619665196,"Stop calling guys ""creepy"" so often when they get ghosted","I'm new to this sub but already I've noticed a lot of shitty ""advice"" which is pretty toxic to say the least. I love how on this sub, when a guy complains about being ghosted, just like clockwork, there will be a reply that jumps to the conclusion that he might be *creepy* and that he should have a think about his behaviour and see if he needs to make any changes. If any of you have been ghosted, you'll know that he's already feeling shit and he's come here to vent. Instead of being compassionate, a lot of people will tell him things like:

*Maybe you're creepy and she feared for her safety so she ghosted you
*No one owes you anything including a reply or their time
*Everyone gets ghosted, it's not that bad. Man up and get over it
*Seek therapy

I often see people complaining that with OLD, people have the attitude that others are disposable and that there are no manners or respect. So it's ironic to see the people on this sub treat others in the very same manner that they're complaining about. It seems as though many forget that the person they're replying to or giving ""advice"" to is a real human with real feelings rather than just some username on a screen.

Also when ghosting comes up, which it does often in this sub, again, just like clockwork, a woman will give the old chestnut:

&gt;Women ghost because some men can't take rejection and will send mean messages / lash out / act violent etc. *I might get murdered!*

This seems to absolve women from being shitty human beings in the minds of those that agree with that sentiment. Why not send a simple I'm not feeling it text or I felt no connection text. If the guy lashes out *then ghost*. It seems many women use this excuse so they can be cowards and avoid any discomfort. Men ghost as well, but they don't hide behind this shitty excuse, they admit they're being assholes or shitty people. Women act shitty when they ghost, but blame men for their shitty behaviour. They let the actions of a few men dictate their actions towards an entire gender, then blame that same gender as being at fault.

Imagine if someone said something like this:

&gt;I've noticed that black males have a propensity towards violent crime, so when I see black guys on the street, I avoid them. I cross the road or try to keep my distance

Think of the backlash that comment would get. 

Why would you kick a guy when he's down? What if when a girl complains about ghosting, the replies are:

*I'm a guy and when I ghost a girl, it's usually because she't not pretty enough for me. Perhaps it might be a good idea to look in the mirror and see if you're not attractive and think about ways that you can improve your appearance
*Guys are shit but they ghost all the time, it's part of dating
*Maybe you're just ugly. Try not to be ugly when you go on dates and put more effort into your appearance

I'm not saying it's only women that are guilty of this because many comments against ghosting on this sub have been by women, it makes me realise a lot of women do understand that ghosting is shitty and they aren't going to defend that shitty behaviour whether it's done by a guy or a girl. In my book, you girls are the real MVP. If you've dated in any capacity and you've never been ghosted then you've been quite lucky. If you've been ghosted and have been hurt but ghost yourself or defend ghosting, then you're a shitty person. This of course excludes those instances where they guy/girl actually showed some red flags on the date. However, I think this is so rare but people seem to say this is the norm rather than the exception. 

People have feelings and words can hurt people. WTF does ""creepy"" even mean? In these subs it seems to be a catch all term for anyone a person doesn't like. In my job I interact with literally thousands of people per year. I can't even remember the last time I met someone I could say was creepy. I've met plenty of people I would say are weird, and plenty of assholes, but none I can think of that have been creepy. So where are all of you meeting these creepy people? Perhaps you should look at how you filter your prospective dates. See what I did there?

Another thing, and this goes for both guys and girls, is remember that you actually don't know who the people that reply on these subs are. They could be pieces of shit irl, deadbeats, or people who are entirely not qualified to give any advice on dating whatsoever. I was looking at a thread the other day and it was titled something like ""How to get a gf"". It had over 20k upvotes and a bunch of awards. Turns out the OP of that thread was 14 years old. Now imagine if a 14 year old kid came up to you irl and gave you romantic advice, what would you think? You'd most likely disregard that person because what possible life experience could that person have in order to give you meaningful romantic advice? Yet on the internet, many people speak with authority like they know what the fuck they're talking about, so take it with a grain of salt. In saying that, there has been a bunch of great comments and advice on this sub, but generally it seems as though the sub is just a bunch of people who have been hurt trying to hurt others. Or shitty people justifying their shitty behaviour as if it's normal. It's like being gaslit by fuckwits online.

This sub mostly consists of people that are having a hard time dating. It's only natural because dating isn't easy most of the time. These people are often frustrated, in a state of low self esteem and feeling insecure after rejection. However, instead of showing some compassion for a fellow human who might be struggling in trying to find love, it seems to be subtle insults and the same rehashed shitty ""advice"" over and over again:

*Shower and brush your teeth
*Learn to love yourself before you can date
*Get hobbies
*Be happy being alone

Almost very patronising ""advice"". Do you think so lowly of your fellow sub members that somehow reminding them to shower and brush their teeth counts as advice? One would argue if they don't know that they should be showering or brushing their teeth that they shouldn't even be dating. These are low key insults disguised as helpful advice.

inb4 complaints and insults. To those of you, I will preempt this by saying go fuck yourselves and I feel sorry for the poor fucks that do end up with you lot. To everyone else, I know it's hard but try not to give up on finding love if that's what your hearts truly desire. Remember that the universe works in mysterious ways and that the grandest of things can come from the smallest of coincidences.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n0vd7d/stop_calling_guys_creepy_so_often_when_they_get/
