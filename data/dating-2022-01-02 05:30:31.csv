I just wanted to ask that since when this become trendy to talk about exclusiveness to each other? Maybe I'm more than old-fashioned but after the first kiss there are no others. Only when each of us state that it doesn't matter we don't want a relationship etc and it's only a one-night something. 
So? Should I fear that if I don't state that we are exclusive to each other there will be a chance he will see other girls? Or what?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ru7vwa/exclusives/

She looked really great in all the clothes she tried on. Beautiful. But what she wanted came to like $400. At this point I said I was no longer sure. So I didn’t buy them.  I embarrassed now.

It's been about a year since I've started working at my job but I've only been having convos with him for the past few months. When the day is slow, I'll visit other departments and socialize, his department happens to be one of them. I'm very quiet and shy but even he admitted recently that I'm starting to open up. Hes not an extremely outgoing guy but he'll talk to you and everyone LOVES talking to him

I'll try to keep this short but since day one he's been invested in my personal life, if im talking/dating a guy. And I've noticed he constantly wants my attention: there were a few times he would joke how I liked talking to one of our other coworkers(whos a female btw) more than him but then one day I teased him by asking if I talked to him enough that day and he said ""yeah you should come down and talk. we should talk some more...I mean why not? Ik I'm not *insert name* but still""

There also seems to be this version of myself that he's created in my head. I'll be talking about how my younger siblings don't get in much trouble as I did when I was their age and he'll say he couldn't see me as a bad kid and that I was a good one who followed rules, not a rebel, etc. Im a good person. He even commented that my parents did a good job raising me. 

My mom says that he doesn't like me because of his age but is probably just lonely and is also slightly jealous that someone isn't giving him attention, which he's probably used to. A part of me believes that because he does strike me as the kind of guy to do that but then there's this other feeling I can't shake. There are times he really holds eye contact with me. Some days i sense a nervousness when hes around me. but I refuse to actually believe he'd be interested in me, esp since he made a comment during a group convo with another coworker that he has no desire to remarry",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ru8sqa/a_pretty_young_thing23f_that_has_caught_his45m_eye/

And ofc, I cried on my way home and before going to bed. Like sobbing (which I haven't done in a good while). Cuz I kept thinking that it's useless, meeting people, being vulnerable just for the inevitable ghosting or for things not working out. And the day after? Well, got straight up ghosted despite making an attempt to reach out. It has now gotten to a point where I feel like dating is a scary experience knowing I'm just gonna end up being hurt, again and again. I deleted the app and gonna put dating on hold till I feel like I'm strong enough to expose myself like that again.

Hey guys, I need help. I'm (22M) currently seeing a (30M) who's married with a kid. We live in a homophobic country and he was pushed to marry her but doesn't love her and can't divorce because he has a kid and doesn't want him to grow up in a broken home. I really like him but I feel very guilty about seeing him. It feels like I'm betraying her and I definitely wouldn't want what I'm doing to her be done to me. I keep delaying the sex because morally, I don’t know what to do. 

He was very depressed because he's in a marriage he doesn't want to be in, and his friends and therapist told him to date guys behind his wife's back because and I quote ""he's not hurting anyone"" but I can't help but feel that I'm hurting her. After a few dates, he told me his mood changed to the better and felt more calmer ever since meeting me and he told me his wife noticed he was happier. 

I don’t know what to do.. I genuinely don't know what to do. On my part, this is the first time I've seen someone romantically because dating in a homophobic country is very hard and I really like him so part of me doesn't wanna let go and the other part doesn't want want to be involved in such a complicated situation.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ru9jvx/need_advice_about_dating_a_guy_in_a_cover_marriage/

There was a large group of couples next to us who all came together and were dancing in a group. Every other song or so, a few different girls would come dance with my brother and I off to the side. Now, we're friendly enough, and it's not saying much, but we were the most committed dancers in that little piece of the venue. No touching or sexy moves btw, just jamming out. But without fail, each of these girls had come there with a guy who would join after about 10 seconds and physically separate them back to the group (dance between us facing only her, etc).

I don't want to make too many assumptions, but it became obvious after like the 5th time that there was a gender dynamic at play here.

To the guys, cut it out! Don't be controlling of your partner; I'm like 99% sure my bro and I aren't so attractive that your girls would encourage any moves if they were already with ya and either of us made any. And if they did encourage those moves, why would you want to stay with them anyway? Relax and have a good time! We probably would've all walked away friends if you did.

To the girls... If you came with a partner, be mindful of their feelings. I know it's sometimes hard to believe, but guys have them too hehe. If you haven't had an explicit talk about boundaries, tread lightly until you do. I doubt any of these dudes felt too great about what happened given they felt the need to intervene like that.

We hung out a lot the first month before he left in the end of September to go back to where he lives to finish clinicals. Before he left we’d been seeing each other for about 7 wks. We talked about us and he kept telling me to go on dates so that I can “explore what I like vs don’t like”. I told him I wasn’t interested but he kept pushing. It made me feel uncomfortable, so I began to think he wasn’t interested. Decided to catch up and hang out with an old friend (guy #2) who considered it a date which okay fair. I told the other guy(guy #1) about it cause he asked if I was dating around and I will be honest. Honestly, I feel nothing for guy #2 and really wanted it to work with guy #1 so after 3 times of seeing guy #2 I told him I wasn’t interested. Cause it wasn’t fair to him when all I can think about is guy #1. We’ll fast forward to December, me and guy #1 get back from a trip and he tells me that his last gf cheated on him a few times while he was in med school. I felt soooo bad and realized maybe that’s why he was so pushy with me dating :/ now I feel really guilty for previously hanging out with another guy back in September (nothing happened between us tho as I wasn’t really interested in him :/) Should I feel this way or  I overreacting? Also he told me him and his ex gf still talk here and there bc they have a dog they got together and she occasionally checks in on his apartment when he’s away (he lives in another state than me, we met while he was doing clinical rotations). I found this kind of strange.. but she’s currently engaged to someone. Also me and guy #1 aren’t officially dating or I guess exclusive either.. and it’s been 6 months. I really like him but when I talk to him about dating he wants to see where things go and that he’s just not ready to date me or anyone even though we already act like a couple.

I'm fine with continuing to be patient, but having a family one day is a top priority of mine (if not the top priority of mine), so please do let me know if you all would suggest that I do anything that I'm not currently.

**DETAILS:**

* I'm pretty friendly/talkative, but it takes a lot for me to be attracted to a potential partner. It doesn't happen often. I can recall only a handful of times over the past 10 years or so where I have been (a couple times in high school, once in college, once at my first job out of college, and once now to my 42 FM friend who is married so I would never attempt to act on those feelings).
* There were a couple of times/opportunities to date in high school but I was too nervous. I left college early to begin working, so one clear opportunity there got short-circuited. For 5 years I worked in a very small company with folks who were 50+ and did little outside of work to meet others. Right before that job, I worked somewhere else with more folks my age. I was in what I considered to be the early stages of a relationship with someone until the job (a political campaign) ended out of nowhere and we all moved back to our regular homes.

**CURRENT POTENTIAL PLATFORMS TO MEET PEOPLE:**

* Since last January (a full year), I go to the gym (CrossFit) every day. I don't do this as a mechanism to meet new people but it's an avenue.
* Dating apps (Bumble, Hinge). I've gone on a few dates but I haven't had  much luck with these apps. I rarely (if ever) feel attracted to someone just from looking at their profile. Most of the profiles seem rather cookie cutter to me; I'm not into the usual drinking type scene that people in their mid 20s typically are and I don't normally feel attracted to someone just by looking at pictures of them in bikinis and such. And I don't get a ton of swipe-backs to boot.

**WHY I REALLY WANT TO FINALLY FIND SOMEONE NOW:**

* It's just time!
* I have feelings for my 42 FM friend, the mother of my 5 year-old godson, who I have known for 5-6 years. She is married. She is having marriage problems now because her husband is controlling and an overall bad person; nevertheless, she is married and I would never even think about doing anything there. But since it's so rare for me to be attracted to someone, I find myself thinking of her very often/predicting when she'll call/text, etc. I know this isn't healthy and I know the only way I can break these intrusive thoughts  in my head is if I find someone else that I can actually potentially start a relationship with.

**ABOUT ME:**

* 27M
* Live in a big city
* Friendly/talkative, the guy that everyone tends to know at the gym; got the ""everyone's friend"" superlative in high school
* Short (5'5), in shape/work out every day
* Do well professionally/financially (but no one knows that, I wear cheap clothes/drive a beater car and don't show it off in any way, shape, or form, and don't intend to)

**QUESTIONS:** 

* I thought about trying EHarmony/Match as I believe those apps are more personality driven than the Bumble/Hinges of the world, but I've heard they're a waste of time now. If you think differently, please let me know.
* Any other thoughts you may have are appreciated. I have a feeling the answer here will be ""just be patient,"" and that's OK!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rubx8m/i_27m_have_never_had_a_girlfriend_thoughts/

36,ruc6m8,1641138182,I was born in 1981 never even had sex in my life because I was hated shunned avoided by overwhelming majority of women,"
I made various efforts, followed all advices I received, I tried everything I possibly could, I even made a large investment, but the result is, I never even had a chance to have sex in my life

The advices I received are

Go Talk To Her / Be Confident / Try Online Dating / Join Clubs / Be Patient and Positive / Pay For Sex

I tried cold approach, even if I heard multiple times that cold approach is futile 99.9% of the time

If you try cold approach, women will simply say "" I have a boyfriend "" and quickly walk away, which is a quick easy way to make the man stop hitting on her, 

or give a very spiteful rejection

An example of a painful rejection - here it goes

Guy : "" Hi my name is....""

Girl : "" GT FO you disgusting animal you have 3 seconds before I call cops on you ""

**PROOF** https://m.imgur.com/gallery/mxKH3fn

The next advice "" Just Be Confident ""

How can you be confident if girls tell you to fxck off even before you finish the sentence "" Hi my name is...."" My confidence was shattered years ago

And if that was not cruel enough, in Toronto, women walk away as soon as they see a man approaching where they are

I went to a bus stop because that is where my bus was coming

There was a young woman, and when she saw me walking towards the bus stop, she walked away.

I did not have any micro intention to talk to her.  She looked in her early 20s ( too many years of age gap )  I had nothing to say to a woman I didn't have any information about, and if I had any question, I could always use my phone.

A few minutes later the bus arrived, and inside the bus, I saw the young woman who walked away

It broke my heart.  It made me realize women will feel upset even before I say a word, and they won't even let me be near her.  Women won't even let me say a word.

I talked about it and other men told me

""I notice similar patterns but that is what it is, Toronto is a big city and women often suffer inappropriate advances and harrassment""

Women told me

""Better safe than sorry""

""We are not mind readers""

""We would rather hurt men's feelings than suffer any negative experiences""

How can I gain a lover if women won't even let me say a word?

Next advice - Try Online Dating 

Two friends repeatedly told me to try online dating

I finally followed their advice, I spent hours and hours to polish my Tinder profile, I also asked others to view and fix my profile

I spent a large amount of money to upgrade my membership

I sent a like to about 70% but I never ever received any like back

I googled and read, ""Don't be picky"" 

I sent a like to 90% of all women ( if I send a like to 100% I will be penalized ) I still never ever received a like back

The dating app finally told me, "" No more available users in your area "" 

I asked on Reddit "" Why am I not getting any like back?"" and a girl told me she received 30 likes even before she completed her profile

And I remember sending a like to a girl who said in her profile

"" If I am slow to respond my apologies, I have 2000 likes from men ""

Next Advice - "" Join clubs in your area ""

Well all gatherings have been notified to stop in my area because of the pandemic

"" Be patient and Positive""

I was patient and positive for the past 4 decades.  I honestly believed, if I am patient and positive, I will have my share of happiness.  And here I am still a virgin after 4 decades

"" Pay For Sex "" 

Hiring a sex worker is yes and no.  There are some things sex workers can give and there are some things only women who genuinely love me can give me. For example, sex workers won't even remember your name in the following day, and cannot even come to McDonald's with you or enjoy a warm cup of coffee with you at a cafe.

As we can't meet up for a proper date for a week or two i feel under a lit of pressure to maintain her interest by phone calls etc.
I wouldn't like to say she is too good for me but this getting to know you phase feels a lot more difficult than with other women and reminiscent of some past failures.

And that night it was really fun. So we exchanged numbers etc but a few days later my friend said that the boy has issues (mostly insecure). I was like ok and kept texting him, but conversation was rusty (from his side). So in the end he says he's not looking for anything more than this blah blah. I said ok is fine no worries (but secretly I was fed up because I deleted his number).

At NYE I was at his/my friend's house and he only got there after 12. I was just acting normal since he said he was not interested anyway. He ran into me on the dance floor and went to apologize again for being arrogant and insecure blah blah. But we did have a nice chat/dancing and he said he still liked me, giving me compliments etc. I said: I play hard to get, I'm not going kiss/make out with you now (I didn't say but that's how I came across) and I said send me a message  and then we can meet/have a date. He said is alright. BUT I noticed he was quite drunk. So idk if he meant it, plus his friend group was also there, and maybe he wanted to impress them??

My question is, should I wait for him to message me and otherwise send him a DM via Instagram for some clarity/ask my friend for his number. Or wait for him to text and if not just let it go because he has too many issues?

45,rud97q,1641141118,Caught feelings for my FWB so we broke it off,"I had a casual/FWB with a guy for almost 2 months - we met online and hooked up a few times but mainly talked online. He was just out of a long relationship he'd been in pretty much his entire adult life so we agreed casual only from the outset. We got really close really quickly, talked every single day for hours about pretty much everything. He'd never done FWB before and only had LTRs so he brought quite a caring/boyfriend-y energy to the arrangement, which I encouraged against my better judgement. Looking back it was pretty intense, but this was the first time in a long time that someone I was seeing was matching my energy and it felt really good. 

We spent a whole weekend together and afterwards I realised I was in pretty deep and had to come clean before it got worse.

He said he respected me for being honest but that he's still going through shit and can't date right now, which I knew. He said he cares about me, that he really valued our time together and that being with me was really easy and comfortable. I have a tendency to be a little intense with dating so I was worried I'd freaked him out, but he said he was happy to still text if I felt able to. After some back and forth I decided we needed a clean break, so we're no contact at the moment.

It was really shitty because we were both having a great time and didn't really wanna stop. It's not like anything I've had before where one person lost interest. I know I made the right decision out of self preservation, but it hurts more knowing I willingly gave up an amazing person. If I'd kept my mouth shut we'd still be seeing each other. 

We left it that we might catch up in a couple of months, just to talk, but I don't have any expectation that he will reach out first, or that anything will have changed.

54,ruegun,1641144432,"Culture influences our perception of who we find ""attractive"" more than we realize.","In early 2000s, stick thin models with no butts or boobs were considered the most attractive. Now in 2022, huge butts and an hour-glass figure are what's ""in."" 

Before any of us were even alive, women who were overweight were considered the most attractive, because it signified they had wealth and could afford to eat a decent amount. 

My point is, people on Reddit constantly say they simply can't ""help"" who they're attracted to. While I think this can be true to a certain extent, the ""standard"" of beauty is constantly changing, and to think we're not influenced by culture is naive at best. 

I'm not saying you have to pursue someone you're physically repulsed by, but social media has given many people the illusion of an abundance of options (or even ""perception of options""). When you're a man/woman and you constantly see the ""upper echelon"" of attractive people of your opposite sex, you begin to develop an appetite for a certain type of ""look"" that truthfully only a small % are.

This doesn't just apply to women either. Men on here will constantly tell me they find most women attractive, then when I tell them the average woman in the US is 5'4 and 170lbs, they don't believe me. This is because often, for both men and women, people they're not attracted to are not registering on their radar. And while the US has a significant obesity problem (for both men and women) and I'm not saying you must be attracted to the ""average person"" here, having the 'ideal' body type in the US is around 5% of both men/women.

If you want that 5% (or 10%, or whatever...) that's fine. Do the work required to be attractive to that small pool of people. But realize it's not that ""nobody"" finds you attractive.

On top of that, I think if people actually got what they wanted, they'd often realize they didn't even want it that bad in the first place. Our hedonistic culture now prioritizes instant gratification, lust, and the tingles™ over delayed gratification, love, and sustainability. 

These thoughts have been on my mind so wanted to vocalize them, even though I know some % are going to misinterpret this to think I'm saying to bang people you find ugly. That's not what I'm saying. But you'd be surprised how many more people you actually could find sexy if you gave more people a chance.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ruegun/culture_influences_our_perception_of_who_we_find/

We've been on three dates. He texts me every day, and on Monday while he was still out of state he asked me if I wanted to go out on Friday. We had talked about it several times since then but didn't have any real plans in place. He asked me if I wanted to go out Thursday night too, so we did, and that was our third date. Friday comes around and we're talking all day once again, and he lets me know his friend wants to go have dinner and he feels like keeping it low-key because he thinks I'm in more of a party mood than him (this makes no sense because I let him know several times I'm down to do anything.... we were going to go sit on the beach. that's pretty low-key already). I tried to give him an out when he said this because it seemed like he didn't want to go anymore - I'm like ""If you're not up for it tonight then I understand!!"" he responds with ""Noo I do want to hang out, I just feel like keeping it low-key tonight. Maybe I'll Uber to wherever you are after dinner with my friend"".

I'm thinking his """"""friend"""""" that hes going to dinner with is probably another girl he met and he was just keeping me on the back burner in case his better plan fell through.

So, the whole night goes by. I'm hanging out with coworkers. Don't hear anything from him whatsoever.

The day after NYE I text him saying ""You blew me off on NYE :/ not cool""

He apologizes several times for being an asshole.... says he wasn't feeling well and he's not sure if he's sick or just hasn't been sleeping enough because he has been working so much.... I'm thinking ""ehhh I'm not buying it."" He says he knows he looks like an asshole right now and I'm like ""Yes, you do""

He clarifies that he does like me and he should've communicated what was going on and he didn't mean to let me down blah blah blah.

I didn't say much and he kept apologizing and explaining himself.

I'm convinced that he just made other plans and totally blew me off. Idk what to think. I'm sad because I really liked him and we make eachother laugh a lot. 

Am I just jaded and assuming the worst? Should I be giving him the benefit of the doubt?

I sent the classic ""I had fun and looking forward to"" text afterwards and she reciprocated. Everything is good this far.

Yesterday I texted her to ask her how was her NYE and NYD we again exchanged a few texts, sporadic this time, and I learnt that she was getting a cold and we wouldn't be able to get together sometime soon. We also had crazy cold day yesterday and she was out with family so it all adds up. The part I feel odd about is that I last texted her saying ""lmk if I can do anything for you, I like to take care of sick people"" and she didn't responded to that and it's been a while. She seemed like a responsive person in general and she sounded interested so far. It's just I hate uncertainty and I can't stop overthinking if I came off too strong.

Does this all sound normal to you? Like she's sick and it's normal that she doesn't respond I guess, also I technically didn't even ask a question but it's just that when it comes to romantic interests I just can't wrap my head around letting it go. It's not like I don't have other options, I just get stuck at one person. I don't do anything crazy still lol but I guess I just need some second opinions.

69,rugbtv,1641149413,Developed feelings for ONS,"One thing I hate from the ONS is she kept thinking I was a player and I agreed. It wasn’t until today I looked up the definition and it says I hop from girl to girl not looking for attachment. This is the thing, I eventually do want a girlfriend so that definition doesn’t fit me. 

Another fuck up I did, was when she approached me, she asked if I want to come back to hers spoon and just be intimate. I said sure, as long as there is no strings attached. Low and behold 2 mins into spooning I was giving head and we had sex.

It’s been 5 days since we had the ONS, we have kept in contact over text but it was very formal like she asked if she could come to drop off my tee shirt I left at hers, to which I said wait until we are training again (we go to the same club). 

Since I’m new to wanting a relationship, how do I show I’m interested in her. I’m not one to text just to text, I prefer to have a reason. Also, I want to squash this impression I left which is I’m a player and not looking for anything serious. Also, I don’t want to go on a date just yet. I’d rather do a group activity, like house party we are both apart of, or meet at a bar with others. Just get to know her while enjoying the atmosphere with mutual friends.

I could quite easily organise something, but in the meantime over text. How do I peak her interest, baring in mind we’ve already broken the physical barrier. Cheers guys :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rugbtv/developed_feelings_for_ons/

72,rugemz,1641149601,Do you attract what you are?,"First of all sorry for my bad English

I am male 30/yo

Last year I dated 3 times and all of those relationships were a mess

First: Independent academics women, who used to do drugs (pot) I use occasionally but this girl did it daily!, had no ambitions in life only showed up clean and ready on the first date, the other where like she didn't care at all, said she wanted to compromise with me 3 weeks into dating, I said that it seems a little bit rushed and she freaked the hell out screamed at the bar we were at: IF THIS ISN'T FOR REAL THEN WHAT ARE WE DOING!! she broke with me and tried to call me back but I blocked her from all media.

Second: Pretty successful woman but she frequently canceled me at the last minute, and called me after telling me: ""well it's not like you have other plans though"" , 4 weeks into dating she told me that she was feeling in love like those of those Korean dramas, when I spoke about how I felt that I was feeling used by her and she not being serious when setting a date with me she told me to man up and act like a real men, ended her by text that night.

Third and the worse: Women had her own business which used to commit academic fraud by doing the homework of college and uni students who had much money or didn’t had the money to do so, she lives alone with her dog (a golden retriever) in a mini studio, dog hair everywhere, seems like she threated the dog well until a date in the park where she kicked and lost the shit with her dog when it chewed some bubblegum on the floor, secondly she had a really weird idea of compromise like 4 weeks into dating she told me I was only from hers and that in three months we should be living together because that's how you really met a partner, ended her by text when she sent me fliers of high schools for our future kids to attend to, I was like WTF??

TLDR: Dated 3 women who were rushed into compromise and acted immature and a bit of crazy too.

When I told this story to my coworker, she said this:

""Well, you attract what you are, don't you?""

I can't stop thinking about this as if there is something wrong with me or just bad luck, met these girls in dating apps and now I am afraid to use them again.

I don’t know the area that well and I also feel that the amount of effort has to be a bit more even; you know what I mean? If someone told me the drove a lot during the week I’d try to find a spot near them or at least suggest meeting halfway.

81,rugz24,1641151099,Feels like I’ve been dumped before it’s begun - help!,"So, a bit of background. I (25M) became single after my 5yr relationship ended in August. Since then I’ve been engaging in casual things here and there and exploring sexually, which is something I’ve never been able to do before as my ex was my first sexual partner. I’ve been consciously avoiding getting into anything serious. One of the reasons for this is my poor mental health; I had a bit of a breakdown around a month before I decided I should be alone, and I went back to seeing a counsellor and had my antidepressants increased.

So, last month I was nominated for an award in my field (yay me tysm), and as the scene I work in is so close-knit I knew 2/3 of the other nominees. The only one I didn’t know personally (24F) followed me on Instagram after the nominees were announced. We had some basic friendly interactions on there, and I realised that aside from her being massively talented, I found her really attractive too. One of my best pals (25F) has been joking with me since I’ve been single that I should loosen up and basically play the field, which I’ve been doing and having a lot of fun with. So, I jokingly said to her that I was going to *put the moves* on this girl, which I didn’t think I actually would seeing as I’d mostly been experimenting with people that I didn’t know already.

So, FF to the awards ceremony, I meet her and she’s super nice and we chat for a little bit between the awards, but the ceremony was quite overwhelming and I decided to stick with people that I already knew. Everyone ended up at a bar for the after party and I ended up hooking up with an old friend.

A while after the ceremony we started chatting on Instagram (I’m not sure who initiated) and the conversation kept going. We were literally chatting pretty much incessantly every day. One of the first things she asked was whether I lived with my girlfriend/wife, which I took as her trying to gauge if I was single, and I decided that she must be keen. So we made plans to meet up over Christmas, which I was really excited about. 

So, we saw each other last week for drinks, and it was great. We chatted for hours and I really had a good time and so did she. It definitely felt like we clicked and that we had lots in common, and there were no awkward silences or anything like that. I walked her home and we had a bit of a kiss before I left. We were texting immediately after about what a nice time it was and we decided to meet up again the morning after, as she was going back to her home city (2hrs away). We had coffee the next morning and again, great time was had by all. Again afterwards we were texting and we made plans for me to visit her on the 2nd. It seemed to be going so well and it felt as though we were on the same page. 

So, I get a text from her on the 1st saying that she had to cancel our plans as she was going to spend some more time with her friends before they went home again - I said that was totally fine and that I’d be pretty free to visit for a while yet. Then I follow up to say that I don’t want to come across to ‘cool’ about it, and that I am really keen and excited to see her again.

Then she texts me saying thanks for the nice message but she isn’t ready to be dating somebody. I was shocked and totally bummed. I told her that I understood and that I had thought I’d be the same having just come out of a relationship, but I was having a really nice time and trying not to have expectations or to put too much pressure on things. After that she thanked me for being so understanding and said she’s sure she’ll see me around and I haven’t heard from her since. It was really weird because in those last interactions she seemed almost cold or as if she was holding something back. 

I feel totally sad about it, and I spent most of the day in bed yesterday feeling empty. This is weird because is not as though we were together or anything; we had two dates over two days. So why do I feel like I’ve just been dumped? I’ve experienced some rejections while I’ve been single but none have them have affected me at all. 

I feel like I want to reach out to her again and ask some questions but I don’t know if any good will come of that. 

In any case, it’s nice to put this in writing, but if anyone has any advice/thoughts I’d be chuffed.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rugz24/feels_like_ive_been_dumped_before_its_begun_help/

But some days ago we were at a family gathering with my family and my siblings having dinner together and the topic of the type of noses that men have came up, and everyone was talking about what kind of nose is ugly or nice or whatever, and they started talking about the nose of one of my siblings (M24), and in the middle of the conversation my GF said something along the lines of I like your kind of nose, that way looks more masculine and my brothers GF laughed at me and said something like ""lol she thinks youre femenine"" and I laughed it off and a few minutes later my GF looked at me and quietly said I like your nose, its pretty, like she realised that she made an unconfortable moment because of her comment

Mind you, in this conversation there was both my parents, and both my siblings (both male and older than me) with their respective GFs, and to clarify, my GF have never cheated (in any way) or even talked to another guy in a suspicious way and never told nothing like that before to anyone of my siblings or other people (im 10000% sure, its literally impossible for this to happen, i say this because ive been noticing that in most comments some people jump inmediately to this conclusion but in this case is simply not possible)

Im overthinking this and maybe for some of you may sound ridiculous to worry about something like this, but this is making me think that maybe she doesnt find me masculine? But that is weird too because I do everything that society expects for me as a male (except some things like being open to her, example: venting some of my problems to her (and she likes that) or even cry sometimes which i know doesnt bother her either or other small things like wearing pink tshirts or facemasks because i dont really care and i kind of like pink tshirts and I know she doesnt care about me wearing pink at all), I drive her everywhere, pay for her food when i invite her, im average height but big, and i dont wanna sound like a pretencious fucker but i have taught her things, and i read and study a lot, im responsible when going out or drinking, and we are compatible with most of this stuff, she likes and accept the way i am, and we agree in most political topics, except for me being a little more openminded in some topics

F19 M21 We weren’t together long but I ended up falling in love with him. We ended things as he was moving and long distance didn’t seem like it would work. We both agreed although I didn’t want it to end. It was more of his decision. I was so heartbroken still kinda healing from this every time I think I’m completely healed he would message me trying to flirt or responding to my Instagram posts. I would reply then he’d ghost me? So I just ignore him now and mentally I’m completely over him. He doesn’t even message me happy New Years or anything. When I post a pic he would send it to me and say something like “Marry me??”. I didn’t responded then he messages me asking how I am. Why’s he doing this? We agreed to be friends, friends don’t flirt or ghost. I’m so confused. He’s never had a girlfriend before me so I’m thinking he doesn’t know how relationships work😂.



Edit : when I did reply to his flirty messages I didn’t flirt back, I’d make it obvious that I wasn’t on that level",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ruijkd/my_ex_keeps_trying_to_flirt_with_me/
98,ruikn7,1641155332,What are your best ideas on what a guy should wear to make a good impression on a first date?,"Hi folks

Just curious what people think is the winning attire to really impress the date.

I'm thinking of wearing smart black suit shoes, black socks, dark blue stonewashed jeans, black belt and a smart long-sleeve white shirt with the sleeves rolled up slightly and with an open collar.

Deodorant: Paco Rabanne 1 Million

Eu De Toilette: King of Seduction (Antonio Banderas)

I'm also quite well groomed.

The clothing seems like a nice smart casual option but wondered what you ladies and gents think?

Is it too casual?

Do I need to change anything to make it pop?

If your date rocked up wearing that would there be a second date or would you pretend to need the bathroom and bail?

I'm a 37m and the date is a 33f.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ruikn7/what_are_your_best_ideas_on_what_a_guy_should/
99,ruikyk,1641155358,did i come on too strong?,"So yesterday I [M26] went on a coffee date with a [F26]. It was supposed to only be for an hour and it turned into a 4 hour date! She hugged me told me she had a great time then left. Before i got home she texted me twice and snapped me saying hey i enjoyed today etc. So we had good convo last night and this morning i texted her “hey are you free this upcoming weekend, let’s do dinner?”. 

She hasn’t responded and it’s been 5 hours, did i come on too strong? i just thought i’d ask in advance because i get busy on the weekends and when i wait last second i end up being busy.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ruikyk/did_i_come_on_too_strong/
