43M with career and 50/50 custody of an 8 year old so I don't have a lot of free time to just wander aimlessly through Whole Foods. I'm so busy I feel boxed into using OLD but as many here will testify, it's just.. well... awful. I'm hoping to find something I enjoy doing that people of the opposite sex also enjoy doing. Activities I do:

1. Scuba diving (\~75% male) -  My passion, but it's mostly male. And at age 43 I'm usually one of the youngest people in the group on outings. I think the price tag appeals more to the financially independent crowd.
2. Softball (\~80% male) - In high school, softball was a girls sport. Turns out, at my age, its a guy thing. There are female minimums that must be met in order to register in a co-ed league. The reverse of being short on guys has never come up. We only have 2 women on the team.
3. Gym (\~75% male) - I went to two gyms (Planet Fitness and LA Fitness), sat in the parking lot for 30 minutes, and counted all the men and women entering. At both places it was 3 men for every 1 woman.
4. AA (\~80% male) - I no longer drink (beer gut turned 4-pack) so I've gone to these meetings before. However, it's a complete sausage fest. Even if the odds were good, the goods are odd. So maybe not the best place.
5. Jogging (\~0%) - I jog 2 miles every morning through my neighborhood and sometimes at night. I think I'm the only one. I pass this lady sometimes but it's not exactly conducive to a conversation. I'm quite positive that doing a 180 and following her is not the right move either.

It would be great to hear from both men and women. I would love to meet someone through a shared experience that is enjoyable for both of us. Also, since I don't drink, bars aren't going to have the type of people I'm looking for. I would love to know what real, post-40 people do, and not what an internet author says on some generic ""hang at a coffee-shop"" article for an all-age audience.

Within the first 30 minutes of our 2 hour drive I told her. I framed it as a positive thing because that’s what it is. I explained that I hadn’t smoked for long and I picked it up as a coping mechanism during what was (she knows) the most challenging time of my life. I apologized for not bringing it up sooner. And that I had not hid it from her with any nefarious intent. 

She was shocked to hear it. And said she never would have guessed, that she didn’t know any smokers or that really anyone still smoked. She wasn’t mad or disappointed, mostly in disbelief. She did clearly state that if I lie to her about it down the road that would be an issue and I completely agreed.  She thanked me for being honest and letting her know. 

We spent the night at my ocean front cabin, sat by a fire in a chair together. We sipped on drinks and stayed very close. Never for a second did I have any cravings for a cigarette. I didn’t even chew one piece of nicotine gum the whole trip. Sparks flew from the fire and many more sparks flew from our intimacy and our unspoken love for each other, it was amazing!

After coffee at the beach on a flat calm ocean we went on a 6 mile hike to a breath taking beach and back. 

On the drive home she shared with me how she’s trying to convey to another guy she broke up with in January that she’s over him. She is having a hard time confronting him to tell him about us, not my deal, but not cool moving forward if she doesn’t take care of it. 

There’s no doubt that she only told me about this bump in the road because I told her about my thing. It’s all good by me, I like her, she likes me, things are on fire between us in so many ways. Lots of jokes, laughs, and memories are being made. 

Now it’s a matter of who is going to say something to bring it to the next level. There have been traveling invites, epic adventure ideas floated, the most healthy, mature relationship conversations, shared pet peeves, shared parenting techniques, and the list goes on.

Bio writing

Photo selection

Iv been divorced for about 2 1/2 years,havent been in a solid relationship yet,I just dont feel I'm in a good place to start dating,im also a single mum to a 7 year old boy so I know my options are limited...but iv been seeing 2 guys casually.

What I picked up with these 2 guys is that they were not really popular guys when they were younger and now that they are older they feel the need to go out and hunt and flex,see how many women will be into them and such.

Now I'm very happy that they have found the confidence and since iv been thinking about this...I dont take rejection personally anymore.

But,for myself I feel that when it comes to me hopefully finding someone to date long term he would have to be 40 and older...this let's me know that this man would have some life experience behind him,maybe a divorce and a child or just anything that would have made him calm down in life...I dont mind if the guy was very popular with woman because that would let me know that "" he had it all in his younger years"" and is now looking for something "" real"" or stable.

Now I do have my insecurities too that could make me want to focus on older men...iv read about the Red pill and its hectic lol,still I respect everyone's way of living and will not be mad if a single guy with no kids WONT want to date me because according to them I'm old,I hit the wall and I have another mans child..

It's long but I feel clueless! 

I've been seeing a guy for over a month now and it's been great. We go on dates several times a week. We both agreed we wanted to take things slow to make sure this is right for the both of us so we haven't been intimate but the chemistry is definitely there. I'm 40F and he's 43M. We both have stable careers. I have two kids (almost 9 and 14) and he has none. I've been divorced 2 years... He's been divorced 10 years so he's had other relationships after his divorce where this is my first dip in the waters after a 16 year relationship/marriage. 

I am realizing I have no idea at how fast relationships typically take to develop before  deciding that you can really see this going somewhere with that person. In my 20s when I last dated, I definitely didn't take things slow and I don't want to make the same mistakes. But I feel like I'm already falling for him as much as I try to stay guarded and think logically (like ""it's only been over a month that I've known this person""). Neither one of us are dating other people (we've had that discussion several times) but we haven't officially moved on to ""girlfriend/boyfriend"" status (which sounds ridiculous at this age).

Communication is great and he says he is really enjoying our time together, he is really enjoying getting to know me, he frequently initiates ""when can I see you again"" knowing that it takes more planning for me since I have to make arrangements for my kids who live with me full time. He says things about how easy things feel between us and it's like we've known each other way longer than we actually have. He talks about traveling together in the future. I've met some of his friends. He's told some of his family about me. He tells everyone how great I am. We have the same goal of finding someone who complements us to build a future with. 

The only thing that he's brought up that gives him pause which is keeping him cautious and moving slow is my kids and my ex-husband. He hasn't met my kids or my ex but I was open early on about the emotional abuse and control I experienced with him. It affected my oldest child the most and she has depression and anxiety from the way her dad treated her. She's impulsive sometimes and doesn't always deal with her feelings appropriately and a couple of weeks ago ran away from home when she was mad at me. She's made statements of wanting to kill herself. She did the same thing a year ago. I told my guy about it (because I was actually at the hospital with her when he was texting me once she was found). Understandably, he had questions and we've had in-depth conversation about her struggles. He said he appreciates how open I have been. He said he's not running away (he said it again yesterday, ""I'm not going anywhere... I'm still here but..."" but it's a question in his mind about how things will work in the future because of how different he is from my ex and how much my ex's beliefs and behavior affected my kids. He's acknowledged that since he doesn't have kids, he doesn't know what it's like to be a parent or deal with things like this. And again... We've only been dating a little over a month so I am not expecting him to make a commitment to move in and get married next month or anything. I realize things take time and I am really enjoying getting to know him too. 

So basically I have three ""asks"": #1. Give me some realistic expectations of timelines on how relationships typically progress at our age. #2. How do I work through his hesitation about the challenges my kids have? Neither one of my kids are ""easy"" kids (and this could be due to not having a strong and healthy co-parent there to help raise them... My marriage was completely dysfunctional hence the divorce) but it's not like they are destroying our house, stealing things, beating people up, setting fires, etc. They are good kids outside of home and teachers and school staff always comment how great they are. They both just struggle with emotional regulation at times. My oldest has been in therapy for 2 years to deal with her struggles. And finally #3. How long do I wait before letting him meet my kids? On some level, I feel like if they are a deal breaker for him because of their challenges, then I'd rather know that sooner than later. But on the more rational side of my brain (and the protective parent side), I don't want to introduce my kids to someone until I know we have something serious.

It’s Saturday afternoon and my second date with a cute attorney. We are going to meet in Central Park for drinks around 4 or 5 pm.

I lounge around and have a lazy Saturday drinking coffee in bed until I need to start to get ready at 3 pm.  

Time to get ready. Spend 30 mins searching my closet to figure out what to wear, that still fits after the Covid 6lbs, that I still haven't lost.

Go to Shower ... see cockroach in shower. Scream, turn shower water on super hot. Run to find bleach to pour on that fucker to kill it. Grab rubber gloves and have panic attack while working up the nerve to get it out and throw it down toilet. Silently give thanks I don’t have my contacts in so I can’t see it in detail...tell self it’s just a blurry brown thing.

Okay, done. Drink 1/2 a glass of wine to calm the fuck down.

Start to shower and scan the shower the entire time looking for that little roaches friends. I’ve never killed a bug naked and don’t want to today. Mentally make a note to contact building Mgmt and book exterminator. Ewwww.

Shave all the hair off body below my neck. (When was the last time I’ve shaved? I haven’t dated since Covid lockdown)

Get out. Lotion every part of me from top to bottom. 

Find sexy bra and matching panties. Haven’t worn lingerie in YEARS. (Hey, second date...You never know)

Spray perfume! (Wow, it didn't go bad!)

Blow dry and curl hair and apply pretty makeup. (This takes 45 mins, but it’s Saturday!) 

Text date I'm running a little late (I’m not really. I'm still going to arrive between the 4-5 pm Saturday timeframe he set the date for, but I want to be polite and communicate).

Take Subway to Central Park. We were going to have drinks at Tavern on
The Green. Meet him near the statue. Hug, hello, he says he couldn't get us into Tavern. Because he didn't make a reservations. No prob.

We go to a sushi place near Columbus Circle that we both knew. We are both vaccinated so we feel safe eating inside. It's around 5:15 pm.

Nice convo, two cocktails, we share two sushi rolls. He pays and says let’s walk outside while the weather is nice. And starts to walks me back towards Columbus Circle where we met.

I'm thinking it's only 6:30. He will invite me to walk the park, or grab a drink or maybe we will start to head towards his place.

Nope. 

He says, ""well I'm heading north"" and hugs me. And that was that. No mention of another date. 

Which is fine. If he’s not feeling it, better to know sooner than later. Attraction and chemistry need to be mutual.  He is a great guy, was total gentleman and I enjoyed the date. This isn’t to hate on him at all. 

It was just funny, that after a year of lockdown, where I’ve been working from home, wearing leggings, no makeup and ponytails, that I decided to take time to dress up and get back out into the dating world. And today, it literally took me longer to get ready and commute to the date, than the date itself. I’ve never had a 90 minute date before. 

AND (ladies, you will relate to this) I think I’m really bummed... because I am having a REALLY GREAT hair day and a cute outfit today. And I’m home at 8 pm watching Netflix on Saturday and scrolling Reddit. Good hair days are rare and who wants to waste a cute outfit? I’m gonna have to Febreeze and steam this look and wear on my brunch date tomorrow! 😀

I was on FB dating. I had talked to a few ladies but most ghosted after a few. One I talked to was nice and we became friends. Kinda. 
But then a lady texted me. V sounded great on “paper” and looked very good. We talked A LOT god a week. Then my friend invited me to her church. She lived in the same town as V so I asked V out for dinner after church. (The church thing was ok. But not for me.) So I meet V at 6pm. We stay at the restaurant till they close (9pm) then talk in the parking lot until 1am. We hugged and kissed. Let me preface this by V trying to tell me she was a BIG girl. Nope. She looked very beautiful. She is smart, beautiful, sexy, compassionate, sweet, funny, strong willed, and over all very attractive. I knew I was developing feeling for her. The following week we talk a lot. (Whenever we talk or text we do so for 5 hours minimum) then Wednesday.... nothing. Then a “I am sorry not feeling good” text. Ok. I ask if there is anything I can do. If she is ok.  I ask at times if she feels better. (Note I spread these 4 or 5 text out over about 16 hours) nothing. We had planned a visit on the weekend. I get the “sorry can’t make it” text and nothing. 

Was it too fast? I tried to not be a pest, was I anyway? Should I just chalk it up to me being ugly and a horrible kisser? 
I really like this lady. Holding her felt like being home. 

I was a horrible dater before I got married (20 years and she walked out). How do I date?

First time posting here. 

44 (F) but never dated much. Met a 44 (M) on OLD back in February and we had extraordinary chemistry. We saw each other twice a week, would’ve seen each other more but he lives an hour away and he’s a divorced (8 months ago) dad so weekend time is for his little ones.

We would speak on the phone 2 hrs most nights. After we had sex for the first time I felt him slipping away. I received maybe 2-3 texts from him and we didn’t see each other for days. I know he was busy with his kids. I know I could’ve reached out to him more as it’s not just his responsibility to contact me. When I would text him I’d rarely get a response. In the beginning I’d get loving texts from him. That seemed to fade. 

We did have one big argument on our last date 10 days ago where I was PMSing and took out a long day of traffic on him. I felt awful. That’s when he told me we’re too different and he wasn’t happy. He’s insecure because Im better off financially, but I told him that’s fine with me, his situation is such because he’s supporting a family. He then made a 180 and told me he was sorry. We went out to dinner that night and when he unlocked his phone I noticed his dating apps. We both met on hinge so no surprise there. However he had notifications showing. I teased him about it and he showed me his new match. She sent him several messages that day but he didn’t reply. He told me “I talk to you all the time when wound I have time to date another girl?” I tried to be chill and let it go. 

I let it go because I am truly in my feels about this guy and we never had the exclusivity talk. However after that night was when he started to fade. My anxious attachment tendencies and a few glasses of wine got the better of me. I tried calling him a few days ago and couldn’t get a hold of him. I couldn’t handle the radio silence. 

So I sent him a nuclear text. Called him a cheater, only after one thing, his ex wife was probably right about divorcing  him. God it was awful and impulsive 🤦🏻‍♀️

Immediately I tried to apologize but he wouldn’t respond to my groveling text (I sent 1) or phone calls (2). 

I know I blew it and just want to open the door for our friendship. I just started seeing a therapist btw because I know I need to work on me.

How do you think I should proceed with this man? I don’t want to give up totally but I acknowledge he probably hates me now and things I’m crazy. Just 2 weeks ago he told me I’m everything he wants in a woman and he even introduced me to his 20 year old daughter over the phone.

I new he had it, I did not know how often he had it. I wish he would have stayed and worked it out. He ran away and broke it off with me. He will not even come back to pick up his stuff.

I have a ton of mixed feelings about the relationship because of how it ended. But I don't think anyone ever loved him. I have had people love me in childhood and throughout my life and I did not need to depend on romantic love for love in my life. My childhood was not good but I did have love and I have had good friends. I felt he never had that and he was looking for that sort of unconditional love with me and his ex wife. I saw a picture of his ex wife by accident. She did not look like a nice person.  She definitely looked like she was playing him. I felt sorry for him.. I don't know why he kept going back to her or was so attached to her, other than having a child with her. If he wanted to get custody of his daughter I would have been there. 

I am very spiritual and I felt I connected with his soul. I do that. He keeps coming to me in dreams. The last time he was crying and needing someone to hold him and love him. He also was in my dreams walking with me again holding my hand and then he disappeared and it was just me walking alone outside. 

He tried to connect with me. He liked me. I think he new he was going to break it off with me too before he actually did. Because the last time we were together he held me as if he was saying goodbye. 

I still miss him. I wish he would have opened up to me and talked to me more about stuff. I think he thought I was going to judge him. I was not going to. 

He also did not open up much about his past. I wanted to hear more about it. But I never asked because I felt he never wanted to discuss it and that was his business. 

I wish he would come back so I could love him. I felt I did not show him much love when he was with me. This too may have been why he left. 

I feel we were a good match. I just feel like life got in the  way. That whatever damaged each of us in the past stopped us from having a good relationship. Communication was also a barrier. I could not assert myself enough and he was not clear either. But we never discussed anything through and for that I am sad.

I didn't think that at 45, I'd be alone. I always thought that I'd still be married and have the happy home that I didn't have growing up.  Instead, I'm slowly turning into the bitter divorced single dad who focuses way too much attention on my 7-year-old kid and my hobbies (on the rare occasions I don't have my daughter.)     


I have friends and family but it is not always the same as having a significant other.  I miss having an intact family unit. I miss being part of a team. I miss having a ""go-to"" person, someone to share inside jokes, sharing knowing looks with because your both on the same wavelength, someone to cook for and with, someone to take road trips with. I miss having my daughter being invited to playdates and just chilling with other families (since my divorce, I rarely get invited to ""family-friendly"" events anymore). 

&amp;#x200B;

I miss being in a relationship!!  I’m just gonna own that feeling. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not to my ex, mind you - that ship sailed like a Viking funeral and burned up a long time ago, but I just miss the coupled life in general.

&amp;#x200B;

I miss having someone to celebrate milestones and achievements with. Those suck to celebrate alone.  I miss hugs when I have had a rough day or just snuggling on the couch after the kids are in bed!   I miss date nights and romantic weekends. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sooner or later these feelings of loneliness will fade away, but they always seem to surface on my birthday.  All I can do now is work on being the best version of myself and hope someone wants the same things in life that I do and not reject me for being a single dad or project their insecurities on me.

What I want help or advice with as they say is this lady did not give much away, which yes I understand to protect herself mostly, most of the conversation however was mostly myself asking about her, which again I was fine with but I was hardly asked any telling questions, it was kind of one sided so I am not sure if it was just me or a bad time, we did text for a couple hours too and I learned a whole lot about her. Asking a couple of times if there was anything she would like to know but I always had to continue the convo forward.
