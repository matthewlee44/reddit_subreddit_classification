1,sc5x7m,1643087718,I have a hard time just being friends with girls,"While it's not the case with all girls, I have a really difficult time letting myself get close to girls who I don't have any interest in dating. The massive problem with that is this: when I actually do meet a girl that I'm interested in dating, I have no idea how to just be a friend first before anything else. Because of this, I have a much harder time asking girls out and, simply, the confidence is just lacking.

I worry too much that when I try to get to know a girl or be their friend, they'll think that I'm into them which just stresses me out for some reason. It's driving me nuts because I'm at a point where I'm not doing on any dates and I feel like it's because I'm not getting to really know any girls.

I have no idea how to fix this, I've been this way for a very long time and I really want to change.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sc5x7m/i_have_a_hard_time_just_being_friends_with_girls/

5,sc6cej,1643089155,Is it a date?,"I went on a date with this guy two years ago, we hit it off but he felt weird about me accepting this date ( that wasn’t clarified as a date until the date) while in a relationship, even though I was single when on the date. He ghosted me and for awhile it was a bit awkward. However we soon resumed to being just friends. A year later I dated this other guy who was super insecure and pressured me into not talking to my friend. Anytime I did talk to him I’d feel bad, and the one time I hung out with him before moving for the summer I felt horrible. After that we didn’t talk consistently anymore, and for awhile we didnt even talk at all. I’m single again and I missed talking to him, so today I asked him if he was busy this week and he immediately sent his availability to which I told him I wanted to hangout with him and we set up a time to get coffee. I’ve always had a small crush on him and I kind of want this to be a date but I don’t really know if this counts as one, and I’m a little scared of asking him what he wants it to be because of how long we’ve been just friends.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sc6cej/is_it_a_date/

7,sc6lad,1643090034,easily the worst heartbreak of my life,"I've never posted to this subreddit before so forgive me for not understanding the format too much, I read posts and tried to get a brief understanding. 

I, 21F got broken up with by my 21M ex boyfriend almost 2 months ago now. We loved each other very very much and I genuinely wanted to be with him for a long time, hoping that we would be able to grow together and mature over time. I repeatedly became frustrated with his lack of empathy and blatant need for theraputic help as his ability to care for things and people was very blatantly impaired. I never got angry with him over it and always brought it up respectfully and with concern, and due to his lack of understanding of his own state, thought I was worrying too much and could just be pushed further down the line. 


Fyi we dated for a little bit over a year but were friends before for longer and have mutual friends. There was attachment present before we began dating.


About 3 months ago, however, I decided I wasn't going to let him keep pushing the issue away anymore. I emphasized how he never includes me in his future when he mentions it in casual conversation, and that I felt I had to compete with his friends as far as how close I was to him vs them. Sometimes I would be frustrated with their behavior to me, and he would get defensive of them, or ""peacekeep"" instead of trying to help me. He didn't seem to care about taking care of his health either, and repeatedly joked that he would ""be dead at 50."" I was tired of this. I wanted to be with a mature person that was committed to growth and to being a better partner. I officially asked for our break to start when he said he couldn't put me any higher in his heart than his friends. He later said this was an incorrect assessment when he broke up with me, but his lack of self awareness was bruising and insane to me. 
After 3 weeks of our limited contact break, I asked if he'd made up his mind about things and he said he'd text me that night. I mistakenly saw this as a good sign, thinking he'd not want to dump me over text. I was wrong. He told me that he had a lot going on in his life and couldn't juggle all of his responsibilities, including me, with them. He said that he loved me and he didn't want to break up, but he didn't want to give a half assed effort and play games with me. And worst of all, he became the third person I loved to tell me that I ""deserved better"" and then left me.


I am honestly beyond sick and tired of hearing this phrase from men who are just not willing to put in the work to be a good partner. I understand that we're both young and maybe it wouldn't have worked out anyway, but as someone with really bad abandonment issues and a lot of this rhetoric behind me, I'm fucking tired of it. I've been extremely heartbroken for over two months now because I miss him and I'm severely depressed, and I'm left wanting him back because it doesn't feel like we got to finish things, he only texted me, and he told me he loved me and wished it could be different. The problem is that HE could've been the difference and he chose not to be. What the fuck am I supposed to do with ""deserving better,"" all that means is that I've done everything right and I get the short straw every single time anyway. All because you didn't want to take your immature ass to therapy? Shut up and stop telling me that. Stop telling women who bust their asses in relationships that. You don't know what you're doing to them. It fucks them up forever and they're going to keep hearing it, it blows. 


I already had depression and anxiety, and my therapist tells me that this was a moderately traumatic occurrence for me and that my nervous system is going through being even more deregulated than usual from it. I don't have many friends and I'm still in school and don't like the people there much. Finding friends is hard and I don't really like dating people I'm not already friends with. Not that I'd be looking for that anytime soon, I'm still painfully not over my ex and love him quite a bit still. Working on it. The pandemic and school and this are all just... Ruining my life. I'm miserable all the time and I want to just get over the hurt so I can get back to being me and maybe even being friends with the guy again. He's a moron but I have a lot of friends in common with him and still see myself caring about him after I'm done healing. 


Are men in their early 20s just not worth investing time and effort into? I'm sorry I really don't mean it as an insult but I keep getting seriously and severely hurt and I can't keep doing it, if I ever get this heartbroken again I don't know what I'll do. Is there anything besides online dating or apps that I could do to help feel better? 


Any advice or helpful words would be great. Please please be kind, I'm really going through it.


For advice givers: Please don't tell me I can never be friends with him again. It's genuinely triggering and upsetting. I'll get there when I get there, but for now, it's scary and I don't like to hear that it's my only option.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sc6lad/easily_the_worst_heartbreak_of_my_life/

10,sc6src,1643090759,Why would someone brag about ignoring someone?,"I (22M) talked to this one girl (21M) for most of the night on Saturday at the party I was at. She was definitely flirting with me (touching me, giving me compliments, etc). I had friends also tell me it was obvious that she was into me. Everyone started yelling at us to kiss at one point, and we just smiled at each other and gave each other a peck. End of the night, I asked for her Snapchat, and she gave it to me without hesitation. She hugged me then went to bed.

I snapped her tonight (Monday), and she left me on opened. I figured she wasn’t as into me as I thought and the alcohol probably warped her perception of me a bit. I then heard from a friend that she was bragging about ignoring me and was saying stuff like she didn’t like me at all and was pretty much making a joke out of me. She seemed like a genuinely nice person when I met her. My friend who knows her better than me told me that her friend group is very judgmental, and she’s probably pressured to think that way and pretend to not care even though she definitely was into me. In his view, she thinks she looks bad if she responds to me. I'm not even that mad or upset about it since I know I don't want to waste any time on a girl like that. I'm just confused to be honest. Why would someone waste three hours of their night talking to a guy just to brag about ignoring him when he hits you up later?

13,sc6zjs,1643091452,Is this guy actually serious or am I wasting my time?,"
I’m a 24f that’s been talking to/seeing a 27m for almost 4 months now. The first two months, we saw each other every weekend and really hit it off, but then he quit his job after his company informed him they couldn’t house him anymore (he worked in a National park that had very limited housing opportunities outside of company employee housing, and after his emotional support dog chewed on a blind in his house—an $80 fix he paid in full for and didn’t cause any permanent damage to the unit— they essentially issued him a “choose your job or your dog” ultimatum). Prior to this, he was planning to take a month-long vacation to California to see family (he worked on a contract basis, and his lapsed in November—he was set to start a new contract in December), so when they told him via email of his situation the same day he was leaving, he decided to think things over on the drive home. Once he reached California, he told me he didn’t want to continue working for the company and that he’d have to come back to collect his things from company housing soon. 

A week after going home however, his passenger window was smashed in and his wallet was taken, which delayed his trip back to collect his stuff. He managed to get all his cards, wallet, and window replaced by the end of November, so he was finally able to come back and collect his things from his former employer—and crash at my place along the way. At that point, I wanted to clarify what he was thinking in regards of future employment, housing, and seeing each other, so I brought up the subject as casually as I could after he got to my apartment. 
He said he wants to find a job here, and that he doesn’t want to live with his parents any longer than possible. He mentioned he’d been looking for housing/jobs in the area, and when I asked what he was looking for relationship-wise, he said he was “open to anything” and wanted to “see where things go”—that answer didn’t really satisfy me as much as I wanted, but I didn’t want to pressure him any further since he’d had a rough couple of weeks and we hadn’t been seeing each other for that long. 

It’s been almost two months since then however, and I’m not sure what to do here. When we’re together, a future relationship feels promising—he wants to go out on dates, he hugs/kisses me often, tells me he likes me, and is very complimentary. He’s made hints at the “future” in conversation (like using “we” a lot, describing his parents and saying “you’ll see if you meet them”; talking about going places together, etc.), and has said he misses me several times. We’re best friends on Snapchat, text every day, and follow each other on social media—and when we’re together, he’s not
glued to his phone, tilting it away from me, or being secretive about messages/calls he gets. 

But there’s things I’m just not sure about either, like how he and his ex-gf of 5 months broke up only weeks before we started seeing each other and how he’s been changing photos on his Tinder profile recently (to pictures that aren’t even profile-worthy!). I’ve been trying hard to be rational, relaxed, and confident throughout everything so far, but I guess I’m starting to wonder what I should do. If he’d of been here for the last two months and we went out on regular weekly dates, I’d probably talk to him in-person about his expectations again and walk away if he continued updating his photos on Tinder—4 months of consistent in-person dating is enough time to know whether you want to seriously pursue something or not. 

However, I feel weird about how to proceed here since he hasn’t been physically here for the last two months. Texting and chatting from afar doesn’t hold as much weight/develop a relationship as well as in-person dating does, so I’m a bit confused as to how to gauge my expectations/feelings for him right know. I do know most men chase what they want, so I don’t want to pressure him to get a job or move back here “for me” since he’ll do that on his own if he really wants to…but I also know they aren’t mind readers, so I don’t know whether to bring this stuff up from a distance. I don’t like to have relationship discussions over text, but I don’t want to keep talking to someone who’s only lukewarm and is content to be in a “limbo” phase forever, either—I’ve been caught in that kind of thing too many times. However I don’t want to walk away from something good/make a big deal out of things that I shouldn’t because my expectations are too high, so I’m kind of at a loss here. 

I think I’m going to set a deadline for the beginning/middle of February, and if he hasn’t mentioned anything about housing/work by then, I’m going to tell him what I’m feeling/what I need going forward. I don’t really know how to address the Tinder photo updates, but it did kind of hurt my feelings—I know we’re far from exclusive and we haven’t had a chance to hang out in person for two months, but it made me feel like he wasn’t as interested as he said he was. It made me start to wonder if he’s not being honest with me and wants to play the field more after his breakup than he let on, or if I’m just blowing things out of proportion in my head. 

Since he started updating his profile, I took the advice of a few friends and updated mine too. I made some new matches, have been chatting with other guys, and am giving him as much as he’s been giving me in conversation. I’m trying to be rational, calm, confident, and remind myself of my worth in this situation—but feeling insecure and playing it cool is stressful for me. I don’t know how to stress to him I have a lot of options in the area without coming across as manipulative or immature, but it’s the honest truth and I don’t want to wait for someone who doesn’t realize my worth. What should I do here? Is my deadline idea a good plan? If so, how do I bring it up? Any advice is appreciated; I’ve never been in this situation before and I’m not sure how to properly define my boundaries/maintain my dignity while also remaining confident and mature.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sc6zjs/is_this_guy_actually_serious_or_am_i_wasting_my/

17,sc7gvc,1643093311,Starting to be okay with loneliness," I had an amazing day today getting so much done with so little effort - I spent the day completely at ease with myself. Then around 5:00pm I started to sense this loneliness which was quickly followed by an anxiety about feeling lonely. I thought, ""I shouldn't be feeling lonely. Nothing is wrong and I've chatted with so many people today! I don't get it..."" Pushing it down wasn't really helping so I ended up calling ""D"" to see if maybe they could help me think it through. 

Long story short:  
I saw that I'm anxious about feeling lonely because I think I shouldn't be lonely if I were *really* being my own best friend. Admitting that I'm lonely - wouldn't that point to a flaw in my plan to feel completely at ease on my own? Looking another layer down, ""I'm not being perfect at being what I said I wanted to be"", therefore I'm somehow bad or wrong or generally fucking it up.   
Tonight I saw what a huge trap my perfectionism is. Firstly, my perfectionism decides there is a certain way things have to look and I'll either push really hard for things to be that way or I'll freeze up entirely if I don't think I'm capable of meeting that standard. Secondly, it diminishes my ability to expand because I already think I know what the process to achieving my goal should look like and if reality doesn't match up with my mental model I get stopped.  
Honestly, I'm feeling so mournful now that I've discovered this blindspot - like, how many of my dreams have I stopped dead in their tracks before? And how my perfectionism builds barricades even now that I'm more present and aware than ever before. It'll pass on to acceptance soon enough, there's nothing I can do about the past and it is what it is. Wishing it were some other way would just cause me more misery. Then I'll get to gratitude - grateful I had the opportunity to see it so now I can start purposefully practicing stopping it anytime I notice I'm caught by it. Caught by the perfectionism.  
And as far as feeling lonely, I'm understanding that it's okay and that it doesn't point to some flaw in me. I value connection, meaningful and authentic, and I have that with a lot of people. However,  I crave partnership and building a bond of love and trust with someone, working towards a shared future. There is nothing wrong with that craving, not only do I think it's beautiful I know it's also completely natural. So, I can be okay with the loneliness.   
In the end I know the first step is the heavy lifting on my end -  to build the love for myself and take responsibility for the life I'm having and creating. Not until then will it make sense for me to truly pursue building a partnered relationship.  
Until then loneliness is perfectly fine, it's just unexpressed love building up. ",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sc7gvc/starting_to_be_okay_with_loneliness/

So this girl I hung out with and vibed with very well until she did something I didn’t like and I told her I didn’t want to see her anymore. We went out on 1 date. We vibed very well and had a good time at a bar. We we talking and laughing the entire night. She had to end the date early because she had to pick up someone but she called me as soon as she got in her car on the way back and we ended up talk for the rest of the night. Seemed like she really liked me and even asked to hang out again the next day. I wasn’t going to and I normally don’t do that but since she asked I figured it was ok. So we hang out and she did something rude to me (kind of don’t want to talk about it because I’m still pissed about it but it doesn’t matter). But anyways after that it seemed like she felt kind of bad but I didn’t like her attitude the entire night. She could tell she pissed me if so she kinda said she was tired and was ready to go. I immediately got my things and went to my car without saying a word. She stopped me and said “you not gonna give me a hug” I went back and gave a half way hug and left. She texted me asking if I made it back and I didn’t respond. Thought about ghosting her but the next day she looked at my story so I sent her a text and told her straight up I wasn’t try to see her anymore so there was no confusion. She didn’t respond and still follows me on Instagram but I don’t follow her.

20,sc7mfk,1643093901,[Vent] Dating in your 30s is a complete shitshow,"I know, not exactly the most earthshattering revelation, but can we talk a bit about just how painful dating becomes later in life?

I got married in my early 20s, divorced at 30, (last year) now trying to date again. The dating scene has just completely become something else. It seems like the people that I'm meeting now are much more self centered and superficial than what they were 8-10 years ago. It also seems like its much harder to connect with people, and certainly less options are out there. 

In some ways it makes sense - a lot of the ""good ones"" have already settled into a committed relationship, and the people left over are much more picky about what they are looking for. Not that theres anything wrong with having standards of course, but now its like people are looking for whats wrong with their potential date instead of whats right. (red flags anyone?)

Being a divorced dad probably isn't helping me much either. Personally, I know that I dont want to raise someone elses kids which also puts a huge dent in my dating pool since most childless people probably arent looking for partners with kids either. 

I don't think I'm unattractive, but I'm obviously not in the same condition I was in my 20s. I'm not exactly top pick if you're going off of just superficial appearance. That eliminates most of the potential in online dating which seems to have exploded in popularity (which I also hate with a passion). 

How are you all managing this, just seems exhausting to me. I know that I enjoy being in a long term relationship, and I dont really like the single life much. Definitely dont like the dating life though.

Looking back I actually enjoyed my time with girl 1 more. At this point I'm forced to admit to myself that I'm just fucking lonely. Yah I'm horny, yah orgasms are nice but its obviously im craving companionship more. I actually had more fun just chatting with a friend than getting a bj. 

This isn't the first time I've realized this. I remember back on my bday, a girl i knew wanted to come see me and i knew i could have her on her knees fast if i wanted. I decided to go hang out with my roommate instead. 

It's so strange to me. It makes me feel odd like somethings wrong with me, ive turned down so many sexual opportunities and ultimately craved the intimacy more. It feels wrong, like I keep thinking, I'm a guy, all I should want is sex.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sc7ulb/forced_to_admit_i_dont_want_sex_im_just_lonely/
23,sc7wzk,1643095074,He says it’s to early to know what he feels for me.,"Hi all, after a bit of an advise - met a guy online more than a month ago, ever since have been talking non stop. We texted for 2 weeks before we could meet up (I was on vacation). So we have been on 4 dates so far, all of them were quite lengthy, ended up sleeping together date 2 and each date since. Last time we met up was weekend just gone and I tried to initiate the what are we talk , to which he gave me a very dry answer - to a question if he talks to other people he said “I never talk to more than one person at the time” and to a question as to where this is going he said “it is way too early to have any sort of feelings or know”. Now I may agree to with everyone needing more different amount of time to know how they feel, however I expected him to have more spark towards his answer and maybe provide a bit more reassurance. I can be quite insecure when it comes to dating and I have expressed that in the past. Some other facts that have been playing on my mind is that’s the last few days his messages have been the same in quantity but not the same in quality. I made a few hints as to him being nicer to me (almost as a request to say something nice) and he ignored it. He is intelligent enough to know that when I do that I want reassurance however lately he opted in for calling me dramatic when I say that. So the question is , are all these red flags? I feel a little silly pick on such small things but at the same time it’s been playing on my mind enough, don’t want to waste my time like I have done many times in the past. I think what’s bothering me is that long term this person may not cater to my biggest need of assurance and security, as otherwise I am very independent and happily single .",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sc7wzk/he_says_its_to_early_to_know_what_he_feels_for_me/

I've spent most of my life feeling sexually repressed because I grew up in a environment that made sex seem like a dangerous activity that had to be avoided. In my early twenties I was constantly on the lookout for a ""fairytale"" love that would make sex seem worthwhile. 

During undergrad I got a job at an Adult toy store that forced me out of my comfort zone. I was advising people on products that I had never used and giving them advice on issues they were experiencing in the bedroom. I felt like a fraud.

 The job came with free product which allowed to finally get comfortable with my body and learn what I like. Now I feel ready to have sex. I've had many opportunities to lose my virginity over the years but would always say no because I never felt comfortable. I finally feel comfortable in my skin after figuring out what I enjoy and letting go of the messages surrounding sex that I've heard my entire life. 

I go out with friends quite often and want to use it as an opportunity to lose my virginity. I want to be forward in my approach with men so that I can finally have this experience. What is the best way to approach a man that I'm interested in losing my virginity to? My friends said I should be direct and ask them to ""deflower"" me in a confident manner. I want the experience but I don't want want the guy to feel awkward/uncomfortable when I ask. Or maybe I shouldn't mention it (being a virgin) and just go with the flow?

About a year and a half ago I got out of a toxic long term relationship. I took some time to grow and find myself again. I am extremely happy in all aspects of my life besides my love life. Work and school are going great, I have a great group of friends, family is amazing. 

My problem is I am a straight man working in a heavily male dominated field (automotive/racing), and I don't have many outlets in this tiny town I'm in to find a potential partner. I do commute some weekends to the city to be with some friends and family, but I am never there long term. 

I have tried the dating apps... Tinder, Bumble, &amp; Hinge. I have had really bad luck with terrible dates with dishonest and distasteful woman who either lied to me, just where too different from one other to really form a good connection, or just simple would not put the same amount of effort in I would. 

My good friend say I am too nice of a guy and will always struggle with myself putting in to much effort and caring too much. I just feel if I don't give it my all from the get go I will feel guilty if they are the one. So far, no luck. 

My real question is this. What is the best way to find my forever partner in my circumstance? 

People say just wait for it to come naturally, but in my field and school woman are few and far between and those who typically are apart aren't really what I am looking for. I feel like it's never been this hard before. 

People tell me I'd make the perfect boyfriend and that I'm a great guy, but it doesn't really feel like that all the time.

40,scbgwf,1643109654,Trying to move on from nothing,"I don’t even know what this post is really about. It’s a half rant and a half me seeking advice. 

I (F) met someone (M) a couple months ago (about 7 months now) who I see occasionally every week (not dating, but I’m around them often). At the time I wasn’t really looking for a relationship or even meeting someone who I would eventually lose sleep over. 

I’m quite a social butterfly, I get along with a lot of people and it comes somewhat naturally. It started out as friends with this person. We’d have deep talks and randomly switch weird convos or play fighting. I should say that we both are quite flirty people so that also didn’t help. I never looked at this person as someone I would date. We were somewhat complete opposite’s but very similar. I should also say that, not that it matters, but we’re different races and have different cultural backgrounds. Asides from that, we were mirror images of each other. We had the same habits,  inseparable and there was never a dull moment. 

I knew that he had a past, he was more experienced than me on relationship stuff I really wasn’t. So really I never saw him as someone I’d want a relationship with. I just knew we didn’t share the same views like that. There was mutual attraction between us. We’d have moments where both of us felt as though we could do more than friends stuff but we never over stepped. 

A moment did however happen where both of us just kinda blurted out that there was something there and since then, our ‘friendship’ hasn’t been the same. It’s very awkward at times, there’s lots of jealousy and we haven’t spoken about the moment since it happened. I’ve tried to have a conversation with this person but it didn’t get anywhere. I know that he and, well I, am being very immature about this situation. It would be easy to just cut this person off for good, and let them go but apart of me really wants this to work out. 

We’re both young, in our early 20s so it would be silly of me to say this but I’ve never felt so connected to someone like this before. I have the rest of my life to meet more people I’ll probably get along with just as well and this person will just be a passing moment. But for now I feel as though I’ve lost a good friendship and something that could have been potentially great. I can’t seem to move on, we don’t even have much of a friendship or interaction for me to still be holding on but I can’t let him go. I know deep down I’m just holding onto the memories hoping that it’ll work out and we’ll go back to ‘normal’ but it’s been so long that if it was to fix itself, I’m sure it would have happened by now and it seems like I’m the only one who cares at this point.

Might have freaked out the next day as it was my first ONS (which I wouldn't have agreed to if I was sober) and thought he might have been trying to sleep with me from the start and been trying to get me drunk. Day after that, I realised maybe I could be wrong, but I had no way to check. So, I decided the only way was if I spoke to him about it. In my gut I knew this was a bad idea and maybe I would accidentally hurt him by saying I didn't actually want to sleep with him, but I did it. He was incredibly nice to me about it and apologetic, and it not only put my fears aside, but made me like him more. So the day after I decided to ask him if he'd like to meet again, and got extremely noncommittal 'I'd love to, but I'm not free this weekend'. Then said he wasn't free this whole week. 

We are both university students studying very intense courses - I can believe that he is busy, but I've now been left on read and wondering if I should move on. The problem is I quite like this guy - and I have told him this. It was going quite well too between us up until I might have indirectly ruled out casual sex. Perhaps he thinks I now want something entirely serious, which isn't the truth. I just need to take it slower than a ONS! But not sure how to communicate this...

He fell in love but she broke up with him and a few of his closest friends including me helped him get through the breakup and explain it was for the best. One even told him he heard she cheated on him with another guy on campus.

I have a male friend who I met through work. We worked together very briefly in the same office and then moved onto other parts on the road. He kept in touch (I say this as I’m terrible at this so wasn’t kept going from me) and we moved onto meeting for coffee during working hours and almost daily phone calls for up to an hour if not more. 
I finally plucked up the courage to ask him for a drink and found out he was actually seeing someone. I stated that I didn’t realise and apologised. 
I made a conscious effort to back off but he got back in touch and we fell back into phone calls and meeting and messages outside of work too. I enjoy his company and we have a laugh so have consciously aimed to be fiends. 
This then led to him coming to mine to help out with an issue I had and take me for drinks, paying and refusing to let me.  I then discovered he was actually no longer taken. However after the previous failure I had stated we are friends to try and not make things weird and would never be brave enough to make another move so didn’t say anything. 
We have continued like this for a while and as I say, for my own sake I make sure I rarely call (even though we talk a lot during week) and he generally calls first thing on a Monday to see how my weekend was/what I was up to. 
We then met when away for work as I was talking about how I needed to visit a certain city and he stated he did too. I suggested would be good to catch up but until week of he only then told me that he was coming and we should hang out. Went for dinner, drinks and again wanted to treat me. The whole night was great and there was a lot of glass clinking (sounds sad but not something I would expect from a mate) talking about how it was so good to be out and have no time constraint.
We met in new year and exchanged gifts (again something randomly started by him last year) and caught up. Talking following that about what we did at Xmas I asked who all he went away with and he stated a girl. I was obviously surprised and I think my tone gave that away as he told me how was nice and casual etc. 
Obviously now it’s occurred to me I do have feelings and probably need to back out. On phone this week he could obviously tell something was up and when I stated I just wasn’t feeling work he asked if that was all, was everything else ok. Which was odd as never pushes usually.

We clicked really well and we startes seeing each toget whenever we could. After 2 weeks she said she was really infatuated with me and i confessed i felt the same.

Over the next Two months we Are steadly progressing she starts calling me her boyfriend and we plan things for the summer. During all this she is giving me all the signals this is a relationship. She compares me to her ex which she was in a relationship for two years with. According to her he was abusive, controlling etc. she was saying she has better chemistry with me than him and says she never has had so gold chemistry with a guy before etc

This girl is from a small village orginally, but mowed to a bigger city to study. She told me straight up she didn’t enjoy living there because she had little social life where she was studying.

She Asks me straight up, do you still want to be togheter with me Even though we can’t see each other as often. I say yes as i really enjoy being with her and i generally care about her hapiness so if she has it better there its better for me because it comforts me that she is happy.

This was around christmas time. During this period we text 24/7, make plans, game togheter, talk on the phone etc. i go 3 weeks without seeing her and i blurt out during a phone call that i miss her. 

She then starts talking about how she is not comfortable calling me her boyfriend yet and says we need keep dating before she makes her mind up etc. 

She then says that she feels like she isn’t ready for a relationship yet and wants to keep it a fwb relationship. She says that due to her ex restricting her life she had anixety that something like that would happen with me etc. she said it wouldn’t change anything about us, she said it was mostly semantics and that its was really just the label that makes her uncomfortable.

I say its fine as i respect her boundaries and i haven’t known her for THAT long. For me whatever the fuck we call our ""friendship"" is the same.

Well i met her yesterday and we had a nice night had sex (which she initiated), right after wards she tells me that she actually has a really Low sex drive etc and how she dosen’t need it it ""that""often. She initiated sex half the times we had it and i Told her during the start that if she dosen’t want to have sex just say so, she has occasinally said it when i have initiated and i have always respected it. So i Ask what the issue was, she told me often that she didn’t want to cuddle or have sex, but she did it out of her free will as she didn’t want to let me down. Which amazed me as i stipulated that any issues that arises between us has to be said out loud to respect each other boundaries. I felt a bit guilty after she said it and was a bit confused.

Right after this she Asks me if its alright to just be friends. A platonic friendship. I said i can’t be in a platonic friendship with a girl i have been intimate and have feelings for. She then acts ""suprised"" that this was a relationship as it was just fwb that escalted. 
I Ask why were you on Tinder then, she says because she was bored.
The problem is that before we met on our first date she specifically told me no sex the first night bcuz she was in this for a relationship.

I said to her if she has lost feelings for me just say it, so we can break it off. She said she still had feelings for me, but she had lost the ""spark"". Something which contracids what she just said.

I question her what she wants out of me. She said she deeply cared about me and that she really enjoyed talking to me, but she was scared of loosing me. After talking along time with her she wants us to remain ""friends"" with that connection, but with no strings attached. I talked with her for a long time, but she was to vague to really Get anything out of her.


I am thinking that she dosen’t want to have anything to do with me, but she is a people pleaser and is scared of hurting my feelings
And just can’t tell it to my face.

During our time togheter she often felt guilty for things she had no controll over and would apologize profusely for things that weren’t her fault. She cares deeply about everyone and often gets used by people for rides, borrowing money etc as she is a people pleaser.

I am assuming here that she wants to break it off, but she just can’t best her self to do it. If this is the case i will just block her, sad but i have really no choice is this is the case",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sccftr/am_i_right_to_think_this_no_contact_moving/

51,scd6bj,1643115617,Ghosted after having sex - what did I do wrong?,"I was seeing this guy for about 6 dates. We hit it off and things were going good - I thought. We had some great dates and at date 5 he invited me over and he cooked me dinner. We made out, he tried to do more but I stopped. He was a little aggressive but I didn’t think anything if it.

On Saturday I invited him to my friends birthday party - super casual! Things are going well. He came and we had fun! I think it might have been a lot for him because I’m sure a few of my friends asked about me and it was still early. One of my friends asked if we could all hang out. I think we all got a little ahead of ourselves and maybe that freaked him out?

Anyways, after the party we went back to his place. We had a good conversation. I asked what he saw in a relationship and he said something serious. I was excited to know we were on the same page. We both said we liked each other although he said he wasn’t sure if I liked him. Which I apologized for and said I usually need to go slow. Anyways, we ended up having sex that night. 

Well he hasn’t planned a date and only sent one short text on Sunday. Sooo I’m pretty sure he is soft ghosting me. Do you think the party with my friends was too much and I scared him off or he just wanted to hook up?

52,scd7pc,1643115713,Can anyone help me make sense of this of what’s going on? Long post,"I(m,21) moved out to a new town early last year for university and as I settled in I decided to try the dating scene as this is something that I’ve never done and it’s pretty new to me. In the town that I moved into, I found out from classmates that tinder is really popular for dating and getting to know people so I decided to give it a try where I met this women(f,23) who was slightly older than I am and have had a bit of experience with dating. So we matched one day and after a FaceTime call the two of us decided to get together for a date which went pretty well and we had been seeing each other consistently for ~ 2 months. She had introduced me to her friends and we were getting along but one day the random conversation came up where she told me that even though we have been consistently going out and spending time together she was still going out on dates with others but seen us getting far.

I wasn’t okay with this being that I told her that my intentions were to eventually get into a serious relationship and I was totally focused on her only and my studies which she was aware of being that I had just moved over to the town. We did not speak for a while after this incident and reconnected shortly after where we got back where things ended and I figured that I might’ve been going about things in the wrong way being that I didn’t have much experience. I later asked her to be in a relationship. She declined it due to be having a lot going on which she said was not going to be fair to me. I respected the decision and was willing to give her as much time as she needed being that I really liked her and never felt this way about anyone else but the problem was that even after this happened and we continued on hanging out, leading to me even meeting her family. She was still “dating around”. 

We did not have another conversation about this until she called me one evening to get picked up from a “guy friends” house since she was drunk and couldn’t drive her own car saying that he refused to give her a ride home. It was clear that this was not a friend of hers because she said she blocked his number right after and gave me a story on how they met which did not add up very well (said it was from a mutual friend but if I was to guess I’d say that the guy was probably from tinder as well) so I called her out on it and she would not admit to lying to me in the current moment.


 That went on and after dropping her off home I did not bother responding to any of her messages apologizing about lying to me, saying that she didn’t want me to see her any less worthy or didn’t want me to be jealous. As angry as I was and did not want to respond to the message. I ended up doing so two months later since I missed her and could not have stopped thinking about her. after catching up she apologized for everything and said that she was wrong in every way she treated me and even apologized for having me as an option. To defend this, she said that she was just tired of getting hurt in the past and was being cautious while going through things which made her make such poor choices and is now fully ready for a commitment. 

I have noticed a change in her attitude as she have been updating me with everything without the need of me asking her and says that she is willing to give me as much time as I need in order to get her trust again (&amp; that she’s only pursing me). We have been talking quite a bit and despite everything I’m glad we’re talking again but At times I also wonder what it was that I did to get treated in such ways after my intentions were pure and also think that I might’ve been the problem at times or have a wrong of judgement.

For the record, in each case they initiated it completely. 

My issue is two-fold: 

1) I don't like the idea of secondary agendas mixing with a potential relationship. I don't want either of us to have cause to think the other is there for a work opportunity. For similar reasons I also insist on splitting bills or taking turns paying on dates.

2) I also worry about my chances at a company if the dating relationship doesn't work well and he decides he wants to do the opposite of helping me. I'd rather not sabotage my future.

She's told me how excited she is for us to have sex for a long time, but never actually makes plans to meet up despite my efforts.

Id think if she really wanted it to happen she could right? It's been almost 2 months and honestly there's only so much you can talk about via text/calls before it devolves to small talk.

I felt like I needed closure, so I asked to talk to her one last time. I wasn't sure if I was making an enormous mistake or if it would really help me, but I was buckled in for it.

When she came around to talk, we discussed the terms of our break up. She did not want to see me again, for the foreseeable future as everytime she saw me ""she'd want to come back and try to make it work"". She didn't want that, in the end she was deciding to choose what makes her happy, and another man was what made her happy. That man that inspired this relationship break, and all the troubles leading up to it. It might not necessarily be him as a person that she chose, but that he wasn't as attached as me, didn't have the same expectations that I had of monogamy. She loved him, but she also loved the freedom he offered her, and so she chose to leave knowing it would be better for us both.

I kept telling myself that I was also choosing to leave but the more I stew the more I realize that it wasn't going to work out, no matter how hard I tried, so it wasn't really a choice. She wanted that freedom to see whoever and do whatever with anyone she wanted without feeling bad, and the fact of it all is that just isn't me.

Everyone keeps telling me I'll find someone better for me, someone who shares my ideals. Even she did. But right now I can't even begin to think about it. I'm still pushing forward one day at a time, and trying so hard not to think about how she's not feeling the same pain I am, because she has love and I don't. Jealousy never helps me feel better though, and I need to distract myself as much as possible. I guess that's why I'm writing this here, so I can forget about it all and move on. Hopefully by writing someone else can find comfort, maybe knowing that if they're facing a similar situation that they're not alone. We can get through this, and we'll find that happiness someday.

Since a little more than 2 months ago i've known   this girl (F26). Due to living a couple of hours apart and our different schedules we have only been able to see eachother 5 times during this time. Our first 2 dates were good, but i didn't feel too much  excitement (maybe beacuse i had been heartbroken just 1 month earlier). 1 month  went by without seeing eachother before we set up a 3rd date,  which i honestly didn't feel excited about at all. But once the date was  on we hit it off really well, we kissed and engaged in some serious  deep talk.  It turned out to be amazing.

Since then we have met 2 more time, we have kissed and made out alot, slept  together but not had sex. We are so comfortable together and talk about everything at this point. I have not told my family about her though.

Last  night when we had spoken on the phone for like 5 hours, talking about   missing eachother etc, she straight out asked me if i am her boyfriend now. Already by the forth date she had told me that she's not interested in seeing someone else, which i reciprocated. We both had deleted the apps by then. For me, it's just that i never date several people at once. I have several times told her that i want to take everything very  slowly because my lack of experience, which she has been very   undersanding and accepting about.

When she asked (on phone) if i'm her boyfriend now i answered like this:

*""I mean, we both already have agreed on not dating other poeple, so technically that might mean that we are in a relationship. I'm only interested in seeing you now. For now i think that we can find inner peace by just knowing this between us, and rest in that fact. Since i haven't told my family about you yet i think it's too early to make it official. Let's just give that bit some more time.""*

She felt very satisfied with this answer and understood what i meant. It seemed like she almost started crying of joy. We continued talking about how much we miss and like eachother.

Now  that i've been reading Reddit, lots of people are saying that  ""exclusivity without a relationship is impossible"", that it's bullshit, that it is leading her on, dishonest and rude to her. Reading all this  makes me so confused and sad. I don't think i'm leading her on? My answer and reasoning around the topic was completely honest and i feel   comfortale with the answer i gave her.

I mean, what more can i do than to be honest? I'm still not interested  in dating anybody else. I just want to go slowly about everything. I  think that the best order of events is dating &gt; exclusivity &gt;   relationship, and now we're kinda in between the 2nd and 3rd stage. Isn't this a good way of looking at it, because according to lots of  people number 2 and 3 are considered the same. Does a relationship have to be official as soon as it is defined?

I (35f) have a male friend in his mid 40’s that I’ve known and been friends with for about 15 years. He’s married with kids. I’ve known his wife since I was a kid, she’s friends with one of my siblings. I’m not a fan of the wife, I don’t think she appreciates him or deserves him. I’ve never ever shared that with him.

We text here and there, nothing regularly. Something I can never decipher is if he’s been flirting with me for years or just sees me as a little sister. 

For example, he takes a vested interest in how I’m doing, sends me apps to try for workouts (which I appreciate, I’m trying to lose weight after a 100lbs weight gain). We saw each other weekly when I was skinny and super hot lol He will text me certain things and I’ll say “okay, dad”, obviously being facetious and he will correct me and say “you mean daddy”. Or he’s sent me memes about having big dick energy. There are more examples of texts where i think “uhh if your wife read this idk how she would feel about it”. His sense of humor is dry and dark, as is mine.

I’ve always thought another time another place maybe we would’ve dated. Again, I’ve never said that to him. I’ve never tried anything that crosses the line and I wouldn’t.

80,scghpy,1643125136,Im (22f) confused about a guy (27m) and his intentions?,"So I've known this guy for 2 and bit weeks he's seems pretty genuine but he lives and hour and half away and works alot I would say. I've never met him but we talk everyday even while working but we've made plans to meet they never happen because well work is work. 

He said he wants to wait when we both have time off and get a hotel and I can stay there with him as I still live with my parents so it's awkward.. but staying in the same place on the first date seems off so far he hasn't said anything crude like send nudes

He just wants cuddles but I'm afraid he just saying that and hoping he'll get in and feel like I have to give him sex because he got a hotel place thing... also we're going to the movies for a first date to a movie I have already seen spiderman 3 I don't mind watching it again but won't that be awkward for a first meeting date...? Maybe get food after?

He seems interested we talk everyday and night he's pretty cool but you know the saying to good to be true! Or maybe I'm just trying to find red flags where there are none? Due to past issues I've had 

I also have gential herpes I haven't told him yet and I'm not planning to have sex with him until I feel comfable enough to talk about it and also trust him it's hard dating with this condition so I have to be super cautious... also with the fact he's far should I tell him face ro face or online if it happens I've done it face to face before and it went fine I don't know any advice would help thank you 😊

Edit: I have mentioned I have anxiety to him, he just kinda ignored it which was weird like he doesn't care or he doesn't know what to say? Kinda wish he said something like aww it's okay I understand but nothing 🤷‍♀️ maybe I'm looking into this to much",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/scghpy/im_22f_confused_about_a_guy_27m_and_his_intentions/

84,scgupc,1643126114,Is this his way of saying “I love you”?,"Im 22f in a relationship with 23m. 

We knew of each other 1.5 years ago, first talked about 6 months ago, started seeing each other 3 months ago, we were completely inseparable throughout and became official about 3 weeks ago. Prior to this, both of us were single for a long time.

We’ve both already expressed the “when you know you know” sentiment. We just know we’re right for each other. We’re very banter-ous and goofy (like male best friends) so we don’t directly say sentimental things to each other very readily but it’s never been an issue. 

Today after a relatively intimate conversation, the following was said. 
Him: “i just realised that neither of us have said the L word.”
Me: “yeah funnily enough we haven’t”
Him: “idk it just crossed my mind”
Me:  “yeah interesting thing to cross your mind hmm”
Him: “you did say you like me” 
Me: “hahaha yeah maybe I did. And you said you like me too”
Him: “hahah yeah maybe I did too” 
And we proceeded to embrace each other intimately.

I’m just wondering if this is his way of accepting that he loves me or am I reading this completely wrong? P.S. I will obviously wait for his confirmation - him to say he loves me first - but it’d be nice to know the possibilities of what could be on his mind.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/scgupc/is_this_his_way_of_saying_i_love_you/

Basically we're past the first couple dates, and hit the home run, she says she doesn't feel a connection. So we stopped talking . Then we started talking again, and she invited me up to her house. We went out for dinner, I paid, and then when we got back she was like ""are you going to get mad if I ask you to leave"".

I was like no of course not, and she goes ""yeah I'm just not feeling it. Theres just not a connection"".

 we started talking in her bed and then she goes okay well if we have sex tonight you have to leave afterwards (?) (I was sort of okay with that)

Then she goes okay you don't have to leave but I know this wont change how I feel (??????????????????????????????). Then we proceeded to do the honors

I stayed the night and left. It's just FWB I guess and the common sense in me is telling me she's just exercising her freedom to have sex with me but I also like her and I'm not sure if I should keep doing this or if she's like just constantly changing how she feels?

92,schiab,1643127804,Unsure whether to put my occupation on my dating profile because of prejudice.,"I'm a social worker. For context I live in the UK where social work is an undermined profession with negative connotations (I've heard in the US it's not so badly perceived). Many people are judgemental about social workers and jump to conclusions. One of my colleagues has told me that he doesn't put his occupation on dating apps because of how public sector workers are perceived in our society. When I tell people I meet about my job, they usually begin complaining about how terrible social workers are.

Therefore I'm unsure whether to note that im a social worker. If I don't list my occupation then it might look like I'm unemployed which isn't a great look either. Like, I think if I explained my job to people on a date then they wouldn't be judgemental because tbh most people don't know what social workers do, but on a profile I feel like listing myself as a social worker would look bad.

Before winter break we saw each other once or twice a week since late October, sleeping over and studying together and all that. We had a nice clear talk about keeping it without labels of exclusivity, because I'll be moving cross country at the end of this semester.

I haven't seen him since coming back after break, and he wants to cook me dinner tomorrow. Almost every fiber of my being is telling me he'll use dinner as a way to tell me he's tired of me and that we should go back to being friends or acquaintances. And I have no idea why!! It's true he hasn't texted as much lately and with less ""xxxx"" or enthusiasm, but he's always been a phone off during class, one text a day kind of guy. He also asked to grab a drink on Saturday but I was way too tired and jetlagged.

I've had two short term relationships end this way, so maybe it's minor ""PTSD"". Both getting distant after winter break, it becomes hard to make plans, something is off when we do meet. The first guy I found out he had a girlfriend the whole time and he ghosted me before I could confront him. The second guy, I bit the bullet and preemptively said hey let's go back to being friends even though I wasn't over it, just to spare myself the slow fade.

This guy is so sweet and the sex is so good, and even though I don't see a future with him, I'm so scared of the same thing happening. I almost want to self sabotage and call it off before I even see him, just to prevent the possibility of it being awkward and the spark is gone and I get confirmation that yes, he is finally bored of me. He's never given any indication of such, but I find it so hard to believe that he still wants to see me.
