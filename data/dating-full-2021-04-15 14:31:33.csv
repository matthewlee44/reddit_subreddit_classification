We met on OLN and by our second date we had communicated that we weren’t looking for the same things. I’m looking for something more casual and sexual after getting out of a LTR recently, and she’s looking for something serious and someone to meet her kid and maybe be something to them. Even though we acknowledged we aren’t looking for the same things, we still have been flirty over text, she sends me unsolicited nudes and we’ve gone on multiple dates since then. 

I’m confused by this girl because she constantly signals sexual interest in me (and we have had sex once) but most of the time when it comes to transitioning from kissing to sex she always shuts it down. I’m a very sexual person and I’ve made it clear I don’t really enjoy hours of making out without it leading to sex. It just makes me frustrated and underwhelmed - we literally make out for a few hours every time and she sleeps over. And she has said that while she is normally a very sexual person recently she just likes kissing and is working through some stuff through this. I’m cool with being helpful for whatever she’s going through but I guess I wish I knew what was going on here so I could deal with how it effects me better. Being teased is fun I guess but it’s hard for me not to internalise the rejection every time and take it personally. And honestly sexless half-intimacy isn’t really what I’m looking for.

So this is going to be a bit of a story... Things have happened over a span of 6-months' time. I'm going to try giving details without giving away anything really personal.

I started talking to a girl back in November through that Facebook Dating app. We seemed to click pretty easily and I got her number within a day. We chatted for a while and eventually evolved into voice messages and virtual dates (we are both not quite talk-on-the-phone people). Meeting in person during Covid was a tricky situation because for the first two months of our chatting she was working with assisting the elderly and was understandably worried about them. But we continued to text lengthy messages to each other and she expressed joy that I was able to keep an engaging conversation and it never devolved into the typical online dating guys who jump straight into sex and fetishes. She eventually left the job at the end of December and we made plans to meet up for an in-person date but she got sick the day before and had to cancel. This is where the problems begin. Something I noticed but brushed off was that she didn't make an attempt to reschedule a date - I did that. And she would seem happy and enthused at the idea but here's the thing.....the same thing happened every time. I tried 4 times and shortly before all of them, something came up. She never lied to me about why though, and I know as much because things were corroborated through her social media and continued messages. But in the back of my mind somewhere, I can't help but think that maybe she is finding excuses to not meet up. She also told me that she wasn't really looking to date anyone until she adjusted to her new work and school schedule, because she is busy juggling those most of the time. So I kept talking to her but stopped trying to get a physical date (we had been on several virtual dates in between all this though). It's also possibly important to note that during this stretch of time (a few months), she would tag me in flirtatious things on Facebook. Two of these times stuck out to me for a reason: 1.) She tagged me on a post (of which I forget the context) and I responded and I noticed later that one of my responses was, not deleted, but ""hidden"", and 2.) She tagged me in a particularly flirtatious post and I quite openly flirted with her back only to find out later on that she deleted the whole post...

Now... the next (arguably bigger) problem: Her friend of like....a decade. Now, people having friends is totally 1000% okay. Everyone has lives of their own that they've lived and a history with people...but this particular friend of hers exhibits *extreme* bouts of jealousy around even her platonic guy friends. To the point of ghosting her and ignoring her for periods of time. The most recent time was after one of our virtual dates... He had apparently asked her to watch a horror movie (he does not even like horror movies according to her) and put it off for weeks until she got fed up and asked me if I wanted to watch the movie with her instead, to which I said yes and so we watched it. Days later she tells me that this friend of hers ended the friendship over the movie, but then a couple of days after that she says the friendship was mended somewhat and they are talking again. At this point I was talking to other girls and pulling away somewhat, but still couldn't bring myself to completely end the friendship that was built. Also her friends apparently jokingly call them a couple because her friends tell her that he's in love with her and she just kind of ignores it. I went on a couple of dates with others and while they went relatively well, I had an **overwhelming and uncontrollable feeling** that I wished I was meeting her.

So last week I *straight up told her*. I told her that I went on other dates and ultimately felt like I wanted to meet her more, that this feeling caused me to think I may have some kind of feelings for her, and that I really want to know how we vibe in person. I also told her that if this was not reciprocated or I was... idk, being too forward or it was too much to let me know and I would just stop things then and there. I also asked about her friend and she told me they weren't and were never a thing but that there were feelings revealed before we even met that nothing was acted on which eventually led to that months-long halt of the friendship. She never said whether my feelings were reciprocated or not, but told me not to stop flirting and that she wouldn't stop either. I noticed something else though - she did start interacting with me **more**. Messaging me more, tagging me on social media more, etc. I even noticed that she shared an event for this summer on Facebook with the question ""Who wants to go with me??"" and I just scrolled past it and saw that her friend in question was talking about it with her. Hours later she tags me in the same event but not her shared post. She went into the event directly, tagged me, and asked me yes or no? I come to find out she deleted her initial sharing of the event. Was her sharing and asking who wants to go with her a subtle way of trying to get my attention? I just don't know.

But based on how she talks about her friend (how he's irritating but complicated, yet ""her match in all things"") coupled with her comments about how her friends joke about them being a couple already makes me think she is in denial that she has feelings for him as well. I am **convinced** that he is in love with her but I feel like I am picking up mixed signals from her and I don't know if it's in my head or not.

I may have forgotten a *few* details but that's the gist of what's been going on and I'm teetering on a line between giving it up or not.

hii guys :)

First of all: I’m really sorry for any spelling mistakes etc. English is not my first language.

So I’m talking to a boy at the moment and I’m really bad at flirting and all of this love things😂

Now I’m wondering if he’s flirting or not. We met once and he initiated the meeting but also brought his best friends with him so we weren’t alone. We skated together and he tried to help me and searched for body contact. He often sends me songs (sometimes love songs) and often texts me first. I asked him once if the love songs have a deeper meaning but he responded that he just likes them so it was a big rejection:/ But then he also tries to make me laugh and we are sarcastic together. He also often shows interest in my hobbies and wants to know about it and compliments my outfits but not that often. We often text the whole night and also have deep talks. We also talked 3 nights in a row via zoom for about 4h each time. So I guess he likes me but we never go beyond this and we text each other probably everyday for about 8 months.
So I don’t really know what he is feeling and I’m too afraid too ask. Btw we are both 18 years old.

What do you think and what would you do if you were me (actually very shy and afraid of rejection :/ )

Fine, that’s not a big issue for me. Generally, she is very chatty and I find her to be very clingy. I am not the type of person to text every day, because it just becomes a routine ”how are you?” “ Have you eaten?” I work from home and normally like to disconnect from checking social media etc well because it’s too toxic. After initially getting to know each other She has told me some personal things which mainly about her health, these are all pretty serious conditions. She is in pain almost every day and it's almost frustrating because there is nothing I can do to help. So it's uncomfortable for me and puts my mood down tbh. I feel like I can’t be myself and tell her my mind because she has gone through so much and I guess spending time with me makes her happy. 

I am a very active person and we spoke about things we can do when the lockdown is over but it looks highly unlikely.

the first example i can think of is when i met this girl on tinder and we got along instantly when we were still talking on tinder before we exchanged snapchats, and the convo carried over on snap too. we both had the same music taste, we were both interested in similar things, like skating, and thrifting. we eventually go on a date and things were amazing, we had both got to know each other on a personal level and had great conversations. as the dates over i tell her that id like to hang out again and she's like ""for sure let's do it"" and we keep talking on snap. i try to plan the date but she says shes busy, and I'm like okay we can try for this time and she's like sure. shocker, the day comes around and she doesn't want to hang out. now this is probably my fault i should've just gave up but i tried for a total of three times to plan the second date but get turned down every time. we slowly fall off from there

another example I have is from a week ago, I matched with this really cool girl off hinge and we connected instantly because we both are into music and were also into the same type of music too, we share our playlists with each other and all that, it's great. we make last-minute plans to go get coffee the same day we matched because we both had nothing else to do. we hang out and it's awesome we again have really good engaging meaningful conversations. we sit at a local park and talk for a while and just hang out. we're about to go our separate ways then she goes in hugs me and says we should hang out again she had a really good time. after that, she just ignored anything I sent her, and she also unadded me off Snapchat.

basically what I want to know is if the issue is with me or if I'm just going on dates with the wrong people, my profile pics aren't misleading and I'm not trying to be too pushy or creepy with anything, I don't know what I'm doing wrong. any advice or anything like that would be amazing because I want to have good dates with people and make new friends, and potentially something more from that. I could be doing something wrong that I'm not realizing, I really don't know. i also deleted my hinge and I'm off all dating apps right now because its such a downer to get ignored so often. I've been doing the process of loving myself for such a long time and i really want to date someone i just think this whole online thing isn't for me, i really don't know

disclaimer: all opinions are my own, we all share different views &amp; that’s okay &lt;3 


my oh my, it’s probably a week before my monthly cycle &amp; I can already feel my emotions being a mess.

I find myself to be someone who can’t ~grow~ to fancy someone, it usually is off the bat. HOWEVER even if I do start liking somebody, I find it best to show that I’m not interested. However i’ll keep them as a friend. 
I truly feel like the best long term relationships start off as really good friendships. You never know what a person is really like if you’re going into a dating scenario right away because people will ( USUALLY NOT ALWAYS ) show the best versions of themselves. You won’t see who that person is until you spend time with them. Being a detailed oriented person bites me right in the cheeks when it comes to this. If I’m interested in you, I WILL observe everything. I’ll look at your posture, what you put into your body, how you talk to your friends/family, does our humor match up, what shows you watch or games you play, how active you are, frequent hobbies.. etc. ALL OF THIS, to see how much we have a in common and see if we could possibly go anywhere from just being friends. I know there is no such thing as perfection, but often times I’ve done this, it all just results in a really cool friendship (which I’m thankful for, not a single doubt). 
I absolutely detest the saying “ the right one comes at the right time “...but how do you guarantee that? 

Honestly, I can’t say I’ve been trying to put myself out there and ~into the dating world~ mostly because of this COVID situation but does that mean I should? Sometimes I feel like I overthink this too much but I don’t want just a temporary fling. I’m also 21 (young and naive for the most part probably) and going through a small existential crisis sort of thing but it’s rough out here for a college gal. 

PS: I made a previous post before asking on how to shoot my shot at my local barista, well turns out that was the last time I saw him because he no longer works there :-) ahaha my luck is just **chefs kiss**

She DMed me after seeing my posts on r/delta8 (Delta 8 is short for delta 8 THC (Hemp-derived), a federally legal alternative to delta 9 THC (Cannabis-derived)). She also admitted to stalking my Reddit history and found out I am a virgin who also doesn't have a driver's license yet. She said that she's also a virgin who doesn't have a driver's license. I started off by giving her some advice on how to have a good time on delta 8. 

Before you know it, she tells me her name and really wants to get to know me. I tell her my name and we have long conversations together about our lives. It's not like she writes one or two-word texts to me, she's been consistently writing me essay-long responses. We tell each other things like where we live, our personal lives there, and even our previous dating experiences. I asked her if she has other social media accounts, and she gives me her Snapchat and we move there. We both admitted that we were having so much fun chatting together and I impulsively asked her out on a date despite living in different states. She told me that she would have to hang out with me a bit longer and see my face first. So I did a face reveal to her. She not only liked what she saw, but she also called me a cutie. She later did a face reveal and I told her she was pretty. I, later on, asked her to take a selfie with her holding up 3 fingers and sticking her tongue out (I do this to prove if someone is a bot), and she did exactly that proving she is human.

Fast forward a few days, and we were non-stop chatting (and flirting on occasion). At one point, we started talking about our masturbation habits and how hard I feel while on delta 8. She even said that during one of her masturbation sessions that she thought about me at one point. And one thing led to another and I told her all the sexual things I'd do to her and I let my imagination run wild. She really enjoyed it. I then later told her that night, ""Goodnight, sexy!"" Even before then, I asked if I could virtually cuddle with her after she told me that she's really cold. She responded by asking if I could cuddle with her for real if I was there, I said yes.

Last night, she found a Twitter account with a profile picture that looked almost like me, and she said she thought to herself, ""Is that my \[OP's name\]?"" After some chatting about this funny story, I told her that we should get high on d8 at the exact same time and chat together. She accepted saying, ""It's a high date!""

Me (24M) meet this girl (25F) in discord and need some advice!

Giving some context, me and my best friends (all males) have a discord group where we play valorant everyday at night. Two months ago, one of my best friends called this girl, his cousin, to play with us and since them all of us play valorant everyday.

At first, I wasn't interested in her, but after some silly talk, we found that me and her had a loooot in common. Then we started to chat in private almost everyday and after some weeks, she asked me out! She was already giving some signals and at this point I was very attracted by her.

Then we started to talk in voice a lot, just the two of us, we found a lot more things in common and i felt that we developed a deep connection. She told me about her insecurities, traumas, anxiety, depression, how me and my friends are helping her with this issues in this discord group and other very personal things that people usually dont tell to people that you don't know in person. Also I told her too about my traumas, insecurities, fear, etc...

After these conversations, we combined to have a date, we were very excited to meet each other in person. However, we live in Brazil and corona virus situation here is very bad. We met at a mall and talked about 4 hours there in a bench.

Unfortunately, the date was very bad, there was very crowded and we used masks all the time. We didnt had chemistry and she dumped me after the date by telefone.

The strange thing is that she keeps playing valorant with us and sending messages in private to me (not like before)... when she dumped me, she said that possibly didnt felt attracted to me due all covid situation and maybe we could go on a seccond date when things get better in Brasil...but i didnt fell confidence in her tone of voice.

I'm very confused about this. I realy like and care about her, I never felt this way about a girl before. but I dont even know if the connection that we build past weeks is real and I have traumas with trust issues.

Do I have a chance? Do I keep this feelings and keep talking with her? Or it's better to avoid her to forget all that happened? I'm very confused... Do I still have a chance with her? By now i'm trying to keep calm and give her some time, but all this situation is making me very sad, I realy realy liked her and it's so hard to keep her away from my thoughts 💔 and if I tell her about this suffering, i'm certainly that she will stop playing valorant with us and talking in this discord group, and this would be very bad for her mental issues.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,716024,public,self,Meet a girl on discord and need advice!,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mrjkf1/meet_a_girl_on_discord_and_need_advice/,all_ads,6,,,,,

Obviously she’s into me if she’s staying over and is comfortable meeting friends and family. We’re hanging out again today. But ya should I ask her if she’s looking for a relationship now?

Last weekend, we had a date. We went out for dinner, another spot for drinks, then walked along the river to see the skyline.

He told me he really likes me and was super sweet. Following, we went to his place and I slept over for the first time (it was our second time hooking up, though). 

We got breakfast delivered the next morning and on my way out, he said he’d text me and we’d get together later in the week.

Well, texting the next day, he was kind of distant. Not really responding, taking a long time to reply. 

The weeks goes on. He doesn’t make plans to see me.(And it was his turn—I’d planned out the last date for us).

So today (Thursday) I said, “You mentioned wanting to get together this week. I’m already booked, though.”

And he responds within FIVE SECONDS saying “Oh, I figured. You told me you book up quick 🤤 When are you next free? Maybe our schedules will align 😇”

And... I haven’t answered. I find the instant response and sudden emojis to be a huge turn off. 

In my view, in a heathy dating situation, you should be interested in getting to really know the other person and feel excited to see them. You should be putting in effort because you appreciate them and want to have fun when you’re together. 

This isn’t the first time I’ve felt this way with this guy—it seems like he only puts in effort when I’m losing interest. But then when he’s “got me” he’s distant again. 

Some of my friends say this is normal and men just “like a challenge” and to play along, but I’m not sure I buy that. 

If he really likes me, shouldn’t I be enough to keep his interest without playing some weird games and pretending I don’t like him? 

I just can’t help taking it personally and feeling like his behavior has more to do with him and satisfying his ego (feeling like he’s conquering a challenge) than it does a real interest in me.

Because if it’s just about being excited by a challenge, it has nothing to do with me. You could replace me with literally any woman and his interest level would be equally as high, if they just ignored him sometimes. Why should I participate in that?

And let’s say I do go along with it, where does it end? How could it possibly lead to a real relationship? I can’t see how you’re building emotional intimacy if this is how things kick off. 

I know that I could do it if I chose, but if he did start to become more interested as a result, I’d start to resent the hell out of him. And resent that I wasn’t good enough on my own to garner that same level of interest.

So, I don’t know what to do. I don’t think I’m wrong to want someone who thinks I’m enough. But at the same time, maybe I’m being idealistic and naive and this is just how things work. And instead of being angry at what human nature is and how things work, maybe I do just have to suck it up. I really don’t know.

However, I noticed that in all cases where we got a conversation going, the women felt highly appreciative to the point where it felt almost awkward for me.

After not responding for some time, one match proactively apologized before I could even say something, giving me the impression that past men had either dropped contact much faster than I did, or had been overly impatient. In her case it was simply due to a busy schedule.

In another case, my match basically poured her heart out to me, and also apologized multiple times for being emotional, despite going through what was obviously a hard time, in a way that felt like previous encounters might have told her in a similar situation to ""stop dramatizing"", or ""not creating drama"".

Simply by being myself, I felt like I managed to get them to relax, as if chatting in an online dating environment always had them on edge, walking on egg shells, waiting for the next disappointment. And doing so, I thought that they were putting a lot more energy into the discussion as I had read from other sources. One match wrote me that she wanted to wait before answering until she had the peace to respond to me in honest. I don't know how much was behind that, but I still felt quite appreciated by the sentiment.

So far, my ventures into online dating have not amounted to much. Being a unique character, and having a physique that does not seem to attract a lot of women, means I dont get a lot of attention, but it gives me the chance to focus on whoever I am currently talking to. If there is one gripe I have, then this is it - not having the chance to get to know more women and maybe find that special one, all the while showing basic decency, since that apparently already amounts to a pretty high bar to clear. But I get that women have learned to become weary, anxious and suspicious, and opening themselves up to the chance of happiness always seems to come with the risk of disappointment, often outweighing any gains - and for this conundrum, I have no solution to provide.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,716275,public,self,"As a man in online dating, it feels like Women are craving for Honesty and Friendlyness as much as Men for Sex, and that is a problem",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mrmpji/as_a_man_in_online_dating_it_feels_like_women_are/,all_ads,6,,,,,

Date #1. We meet at this restaurant and it seems to be going good. I can hear the excitement in her voice as we talk about common interests. As we’re wrapping up she says she’ll text me later and she does. It was a positive response and she continued texting me often with energy for a few days. I asked her out again her first excuse was she had things going over the next few weekends. Then I get less responses with no energy and ask her out again this time she says she can’t date due to pstd from a past relationship.

Date #2 we also meet at restaurant. The restaurant was very busy we sat in the lobby for 30 min. I was literally doing all of the talking and her only responses were “yea” or something vague. Finally she asks for a rain check due to not feeling well. I wasn’t feeling it with her either. Never heard from her again. 

Date #3. She actually lives in my neighborhood. We had a lot of stuff in common and seemed great. After matching online she was very responsive and had high energy. After a few days  I got less responses but the energy was still there. I ask her out for drinks and we were there for hours just talking and seemed like a great time.

i met this guy about a week ago, it's been a while since someone approached me directly and asked me for my number, which i found endearing. we basically began texting that day, pretty solid paragraphs which again, is rare to come by these days (sadly enough lmao), and the topic of hanging out came up. i had suggested that we get coffee and vibe, and he basically almost immediately suggested that we hang out at his place and ""talk"". i softly denied that suggestion, maintaining the coffee idea, which he seemed to be in agreement with. he was off on sunday and we had made loose plans to hang out. i say loose because he told me that he ""should"" be free after doing a couple of errands, but he stopped responding all-together that evening. i had reached out to him the following day, basically stating that he doesn't seem to be all too interested in hanging out and that i am not looking to waste time or be an involuntary part of anyone's games. 

he responded back to that text, basically saying something along the lines of ""i lost track of time i started cleaning the house just in case you wanted to come over and i wanted everything to look and sleep clean"". look and sleep clean...okay. at that point i reiterated that i just would've liked to get coffee with him, and we moved past it. during this point he told me that he allegedly isn't looking for games either, and felt compelled to share that he allegedly hasn't done anything with a girl in 3 years since his last relationship. i guess this was an attempt to make it seem like he's seeking something legit, i don't know. everything's been alright this week, just a lot of ping-ponging back and forth via text (he apologized again for the sunday incident during this time). 

fast-forward to yesterday when the conversation somehow got to the concept of cuddling, during which i admitted that i've never cuddled anyone before. he seemed surprised, and proceeded to say ""i have more questions now"", after which he blatantly asked me if i am a virgin. he said, and i quote, ""it's nothing bad if you are it's just that i've never met a virgin before but i'm just very curious now"". i admitted that i am, and after that....nothing lmao. absolutely nothing, all day. 

i know that shit comes up and that people lead busy lives, but the fact that the conversation paused right there is just a little too sus, not to mention that we're all practically glued to our phones so it's difficult to believe that you wouldn't even have a minute in the day to text back someone you're supposedly into. it just hurts. and i hate that it hurts, because i sort of saw this coming, i breezed past the red flags, like him not asking anything about me, immediately jumping to pet names like ""beautiful"" and ""my love"" (my love, after a week)? i know. i know it's stupid, but i still chose to engage. i don't know how much more clear i can be with someone when i say i am literally not looking for games/hooking up, i mentioned this at least three times to him. i am not seeking an immediate relationship, but at the same time i am not about to just hop into bed with someone i know virtually nothing about.

He's only 2-3 years older than me. We used to go to the same high school before graduated. I actually kinda forgot about him. I've never been in a real relationship besides FWB/FB but I know what it's like to be heartbroken. 

Anyways, about a few weeks ago, I get a follow request from this boy(let's call him Alex) and obviously I let him because why not. I was kinda surprised he still remembered me after all these years. We used to be in the same study hall in high school and he was kind and funny. But that was really it. I'm not that memorable of a person. My name is complicated and isn't spelled how it's pronounced. So here's the backstory of me: people in my high school knew me to be the girl that guys would hook up with. It's no secret that I have fucked other guys but atp I can't do anything about it...so I kinda accpeted it. It doesn't really bother me. It kind of allows me to get with other guys but it is hard to get a real relationship. I've always wanted to date someone but could never make my intentions clear or set boundaries. So yeah.

Anyways, I let him follow me. On sunday, he slides into my dm's being like ""you go to X college?"". When I read that, I was being rushed by mom to get to the dinner table and didn't read it correctly. I will be attending X school in the fall. But my dumbass replied back ""yuh"". So he replies with ""let's drink sometime, here's my snap""...my stupid ass was like ""oh i don't have snap yet but I will when i go to college"" he responds with ""ohhhhhh i thought you go to X college"" and it was really embarassing. And so yeah. I try to make small talk by being like ""what college do you go to"" bc he's so hot. He responds...i'm like ""oh vibe"". today he responds ""yeah lol...it's fun""...i responds ""that's nice :)"" 

I ask him ""how do you remember me after all these years?"" he responds ""i don't forget ppl""""ever""""how do you stll remember me"" I hit back with ""I don’t forget ppl either. also bc we were in the writing center together my sophomore year"" anyways...i ask him how's life...he responds...boring and lonely. 

blah blah blah...i create my snapchat acc today for obvious reasons. I post my acc on my instagram story hoping he would see it...he does...he doesn't add me. Now...I'm snapping my friend on what to do. I fucking face my fear and add him first...in a split second adds me back. I don't say anything for like 10 minutes and then HE SNAPS ME FIRST. lol anyway we start talking. he let's me know he's drunk. tells me that he's usually ""drunk, horny, or stoned"" i reply with ""hungry, sleepy, or stoned"" he tells me he's crossed. anyways, he ends our convo being like ""i'm going to stop snapping back so i don't say anything dumb while being horny af"".

so here's my thing: I have no problem fucking him but I really want to date him. I don't know how. I'm really awkward. I would also like to point that our colleges are really close to each other less than 15 minute drive depending on traffic. so what do i do? I've also never drank but lowkey wanna with him but i'm afraid he'll get me fucked up so he can fuck me. but i also wanna date him. and fuck him. 

TL;DR: this guy at college(2-3 years older than me) hits me up after like 2 years bc we went to high school together. i fuck up by telling him that i'm in college bc i read the question wrong...but he slid in my dms asking to drink w him and add him on snap. i add him on snap and he lets me knwo he's drunk...and horny...then tells me he's crossed. Tells he won't respond bc he doesn't want to say anything while horny.

During the two weeks of ghosting him, I was moving apartments, recovering from wisdom teeth surgery, got let go of my job, I was super insecure about my looks (job stress made me lose a lot of my hair and aged my skin 100 years), The League has a terrible UX/UI so I hate even using it and people also have different pandemic situations so I just assumed he wouldn't even be willing to meet up with me (ex: some people aren't comfortable meeting up in person because they visit their relatives often). 

Overall, I had zero mental bandwidth to be dealing with stuff like dating. I had to work on myself and build my confidence back up before I could even give that area of my life attention again.

Despite the silent period, he still texted me a few days later. I told him everything I was going through when we met up in person and thanked him for being patient. Surprisingly he understood my situation and wasn't petty about it.
