When she talks to me she gets all close to my face like she is going to kiss me. She even asked me if I noticed her nipples are hard. When she heard that I was going nights with her she jumped up and hugged me.

She recently switched shifts so I would work overtime to see her and spend time with her. She would do the same things still but it was less often since we didn't see each other besides during shift change. So I decided to text her and see if she wanted to go out. So I asked her how she was told her I missed her and wanted to know if she wanted to go out. She just said she can't and isn't that a holiday which it was I had gotten my days mixed up.

Which was kinda embarrassing and hurtful but I answered her anyways and said cause we haven't worked or seen each other. 

So I pulled back after that and just kinda kept to myself didn't bother to say anything to her. She started to just jump in my convos with ither ppl and ask why I dint like her anymore.

so I matched with this girl a few weeks back, seriously the best looking girl I've ever seen, a literal 10/10, and she messaged me right away. whole thing seemed too good to be true from the start (I look good I guess but not nearly that good imo). Turned out she was actually a real person.

we talked for a few weeks. we had a huge amount of common interests, and similar humor. it was going great I thought, even though I started to notice she didn't chat that often or start the chatting. figured she might be one of those who's trying to cut their social media usage. 

well, turns out I was right, since she deleted her instagram and snapchat suddenly, without telling me. I messaged her on tinder two days later since she still had the profile up, and she said that she kinda just did it suddenly and told nobody, she wanted a break, and apparently wasn't ghosting me. I asked for her number, but she said she doesn't like giving it out, little weird at this point (or is it?), but she asked if I have discord. 

I said ""yeah, (username)""

that was two days ago. no new discord friends. 
i remember her saying she doesn't use tinder much but isn't it a bad sign itself that she doesn't even seem to remember me, again?

I realize she might sound a little unhinged in this text (so do i), but she had just gotten out of a relationship and has some shit going on in her life rn, especially this month, so I do get it if that's the reason, but the issue is that I don't know. I honestly cannot tell if I'm being ghosted or not and it makes me extremely anxious since I actually see potential here, or saw. I don't know.

I figured i'd send her a message tomorrow asking what's going on here.

They would never kiss in public, and would often mention the possibility of getting divorced. My mom is often mean to and about my dad, exaggerating his failures, and complaining that he doesn't do more. (Why can't you build the addition to our house so we don't need to hire contractors? Redo the plumbing? Hold a job?)

My dad often threatened to leave, crying and calling my mom a bully, although he wasn't really the victim. He had a temper and would typically resort to hitting me, but sometimes my mom. 

Because of my parents relationship, I've always tried to be the opposite. I'd overlook a lot, and shower my partner with affection, which can sometimes be too much. I'd feel uncomfortable making him pay, so I'd offer to pay for myself or us both a lot of the time, bake his favorite cookies and be very attentive. On the other side, sometimes I would get a boyfriend just for the sake of being in a relationship and having someone there for me, which usually ends in me breaking up with him out of boredom.  It's hard for me to have any self worth in myself when I'm not in a relationship, which leads to the scary thoughts of me being alone forever.

In addition to this, I was also sexualized from a young age. I hit puberty at about 7, and would do anything possible to hide it, often wearing baggy clothes, and crying that I couldn't be small and skinny like the other girls. I was also one of the firsts to get into a ""relationship"" in middle school, where I started feeling a little more confident about myself. By the time I was 14, I was ""dating"" a science teacher at another school (he was 22) and while I didn't feel taken advantage of,  we were kinky and I had an  ""older"" boyfriend, which made me feel more mature than the other 14 year olds. He was also the first traditionally attractive guy to be into me. Even though I'm sure he was a pedophile, it was hard to see when he never treated me anything but good. He'd hug me extra tight when he saw the bruises from my dad, and cheer me up with my favorite foods. He told me he loved me and wrote me love songs, which was something entirely new to me. He even wanted to tell my parents he loved me, even if that meant we couldn't be alone until I was 18. 

My parents didn't take it well, and threatened to send him to jail. Heartbroken, I tried to distract myself by getting a job, and ended up doing some things I regret with a guy in his early twenties, who 100% sexualized me for my age, calling me jailbait and bragging to all our coworkers. I just wanted a one night thing, and he got angry and called me names when he realized I didn't want to continue. My other coworkers (19-21) tried to hit on me then, and still try today. 

I ended up dating a 17 y old coworker for a few months when I was 15, but looking back, he only wanted me because everyone else did, and would often brag about all the stuff we did.  He also did drugs and got us into multiaple car accidents. When I noticed he wasn't as interested, I hooked up with his friend to make him jealous, making him love me all over again. His friend forced me to kiss him once and then tried telling me to leave my coworker and be with him, and still sends me unsolicited nudes and videos a few times a year. After all that, I've been trying to create a better reputation for myself, and even though it's been years of me resisting their advances, they still try. Even the married ones. I'm not sure if it's because of how I look, or my reputation. Aside from the friend forcing me to kiss him, another coworker started grabbing my ass once, which makes me feel gross and sexually assaulted. 

I downloaded a dating site a few months before my 16th birthday, just for the validation, I told myself, and ended up getting 300+ matches. I hit it off with one guy there, who was thankfully only 4 years older. We hooked up a lot and tried dating on and off unsuccessfully. He didn't feel sparks with me, which he said was mainly because of my crazy family and me being too judgmental. We've stopped having sex, and since then just been friends, although I still think I have some feelings for him.  Even though we're friends and keep it respectful, he'll still tell me I'm really hot.

Right now I want to get back into dating, but I feel too messed up to do it. My one friend told me I'm really broken, which makes it hard, while another told me my crazy parents scare people away. I skipped my last year of highschool too, which makes me feel really different from all my community college classmates who are all 25ish, although all my best friends are in their mid twenties.

I thought that was extremely backwards. I also found it hard to take him seriously now.

Then it happened again. I casually started seeing this guy; we both went in with no expectations and the chemistry is crazy insane. He really wanted to have sex though (and so did I admittedly). I thought he would ghost but he actually started stepping his game up and took me on a much more serious date with a conversation at the end of the night basically asking where do I see this going and if I wanted something a bit more ‘serious’.

We are quite serious about this relationship, but he hasn’t asked me to be his gf yet.

For New Year’s we traveled together, to a town close to were we live. (I live in Latin America)

We attended a small party on New Years, and we both got quite drunk. When I got to the hotel I immediately fell asleep.

The next morning when I woke up, he was already up and seemed kinda mad?

I asked what was wrong and he said he had gone through my phone and found my texts with my ex.  (We hadn’t had talked for months, he wanted to see me  I replied that that could be a possibility but never said yes. I honestly didn’t want to see him)

He was uncomfortable because months back I had told him about my ex, who wanted to see me and give me what he had bought on his trip, and I said that I was not interested. 

But he saw on the texts that I had asked him what it was, so I was showing I was “interested”. 

I honestly think it was just polite conversation. 

I’m feeling a little bit conflicted, a bit angry because he went through my phone, and a little bit guilty because I feel he is taking the conversation out of context, plus he was very drunk, he doesn’t even remember exactly what he read.

We have discussed this, he says the way he is feeling is not rooted in insecurity or jealousy, but rather that what I say and what I do are not the same.

He goes to college out of state and we have hooked up off and on for the past 4 years when he comes home. We usually reconnect when one of us is single ... we definitely use each other as rebound sex. 

Anyways, 3 weeks ago I wanted to hit him up but then I looked at his instagram and twitter and there were pictures with a girl so I assumed he was in a relationship and didn't hit him up.   

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to Christmas he texts me. We exchange pleasantries (I'm going through a breakup and he says he just got out of something ... mind you all the pictures are still on social media). I go over to see him and I ask more information about the break up. He says he ended it a week ago but they are still in contact. I asked for confirmation that they weren't together.  I wanted to hook up but I'm not about fucking people who are in relationships. He said it was still fresh and that's why the pictures are still up. We hook up. He goes back to school  and we keep texting. The agreement is that if he gets back with his ex we will stop talking (we've always been friends and the conversation hasn't been sexual for the most part). However, I think it is inappropriate to be friends with someone you hooked up with while in a relationship. When I have gotten into a relationship I have cut off contact. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to this week, I followed him on instagram and he didn't follow me back which is weird but I was like whatever. Him and his ex both play basketball. He shared a photo from the female basketball team with his ex and another girl and tagged them both in it... this is when I really thought something was weird. And then today I noticed that his story hadn't popped up on my feed so I searched his name and he was gone. I realized I was blocked. I asked him why and he said ""My ex has my ig so she probably recognized you and blocked you.""

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't responded because that seems like a load of bullshit to me. I've never given an SO access to my social media but if I did I'm sure that would be the first thing I would cut off their access too even if we were still talking.

My family is also extremely chill when it comes to people coming over, or staying the night as our house is very big and we practically have our own sections that aren't on top of each other.  


That being said, I have wanted to move out for a LONG time. I moved out with an ex in 2015 to an apartment but then she and I moved back in with my parents to try and save for a house. Low and behold, we break up in 2019 and those savings went away during covid after losing my job and trying to pay off medical debt/car bills. Those are all taken care of but I now I can't afford a house. I really want out though. I know I have a good living situation but I want my freedom. I refuse to live with my parents when I'm 30, even though I love them. I still pay rent so it's not like I'm freeloading.   


My question is, at this point with dating am I better off trying to save for a house and potentially not moving out until I'm like 32/34? Or do I find a job that pays enough and go month to month.

We start talking and, she doesn't stop talking and she was extremely flirty. We (mostly her) talked for around 3 hours and closed the place out. During that time, she showed me all sorts of pictures in her phone, all the stuff she makes, etc... and she noticed my hands were cold so she put them between her legs lol. She's 46, im 33. She's been married 25 years and has 2 grown adult children. Her husband and son are currently in Hawaii and I'm assuming she was lonely or something and was just getting out, idk? But she got a pizza to go and basically said she was just gonna go home and eat it by herself. The way she said it was very leading though, so I asked if she would want any company. She kind of smiled and didn't say yes or no. We walk to the parking lot, talk some more at her car, end up making out, she tells me shes not wearing a bra and puts my hand on her jug. It's 10pm at this point and, while in the bar we were deciding where we should go to next. All of a sudden she ""gets a text"" and says she has to go, and that was that.

I'm a pretty confident and secure guy so I just took a seat and observed. I wasn't trying to let it ruin my night, but they didnt stop until after a couple of her coworkers that I'm cool with came up to me (separately) and clearly were aware that they were dancing in a way that was inappropriate. 

She knew I was there watching and didn't think she had done anything wrong until after I expressed my feelings.

We are both digital nomads that work remotely and spoke every day throughout the pandemic with him constantly asking me to visit. I eventually flew to visit him for 6 weeks. 

I stayed at his apartment and we spent every day together. He would alter his work schedule to spend as much time with me as possible and took me on romantic thoughtful dates every day. We have sex, and he introduced me to his friends as his girlfriend, despite us never having the discussion on what we were.

At first I found this strange but then it became nice. He introduced me to everyone as his girlfriend, was always very affectionate, always holding my hand everywhere we go, etc. He even said he loved me. 

After a month I decided to talk with him. I said “I’m leaving in X weeks and I feel very sad about leaving you. What do you think happens next?” 

His answer? “Nothing you came here for a vacation” 

I was a bit upset as I didn’t have expectations at first but found myself falling for him and I read into his actions as meaning something more. When I said that I didn’t expect anything but ended up developing feelings, he kept reiterating “yeah but you knew you were coming here for just a trip”.

He said I could stay at his place with him as long as I wanted. I can stay in his country for 3 months. But I wanted him to want me there, which he assures me he does. 

But what happens in 2 months time ? I asked if he was looking for a relationship at this point in time and he said that he’d like one but he didn’t see it fitting in his life right now. 

We discussed it and I said I’d perhaps leave early and not waste more time as I’d misunderstood. He said I could stay with him another month or two and we could see where it goes. But I think he sounds half assed about it and I don’t want to chase after someone.

I’m upset and humiliated that he doesn’t want anything at all after acting like we are a lovey dovey couple all the time. Not even plans or discussion to meet again, anything. 

I’m thinking about going to the next country to work remotely, where I have friends I can spend time with, and leave with my self respect intact. 

I’m feeling humiliated that I not only travelled a long way to see him, but that I really thought he wanted to be in a relationship with me and he’s acting like it’s just a temporary thing that’s it. We have known each other years and when we previously were together, I had just ended an abusive relationship and decided I could not continue as I was not ready.

During this time me and her were both going through a very stressful period in our lives. I had never been in a relationship that lasted longer than a month. My past gfs I broke up with because I did not want to be tied down and also in my life relationships did not ever seem to last we'll just say that, and somebody always got hurt. My parents got divorced when I was a kid and I had quite a few broken hearts dating in school but eh what are you gonna do that's just common teenager shit. My childhood was not a very caring environment and I have grown up with a very guarded personality and it is hard for me to make an emotional connection. She seemed to also be going through a depressive episode and I was scared about some of the things she talked about. Not because it made her seem unattractive to me, not at all, its just I have thought those depressive feelings and got through them in high school and did not want to feel them again. 

So I decided to break it off with my ex because I was scared of our relationship and what I was feeling towards her, and basically I was scared and overwhelmed with everything in my life. 

Come to the present where it is 6 months later I ask her out for a coffee to see how she's doing. And she seems to be doing good and we get to talkin and starting hanging out and talking about experiences in the last 6 months as well as when we were together. After we are done hanging I ask her if she wants to go out to a nearby theme park where we live. She says yes!

We go out there and have another good time together. Joking, laughing, telling stories! I still keep myself pretty vague about my feeling because it is hard for me to open up. I ask her out for another date and she says yes! This time were are going to see the sites at a nearby boardwalk.

At this point, I am falling in love with this girl all over again, the truth is I always loved her I was just scared and ran because of past experiences. However my goal is to confess my feelings about us at the Boardwalk and ask her if we can start over. 

At the Boardwalk we have another great time just like the last 2 times we hung out! And I get up the nerve and confess my feelings for her and apologize for leaving her when it was evident she was in a depressive episode. She tell me its ok and says some of the blame comes to her as she needed help and she wouldn't get it when I was with her. And when we split up she finally got the help and medication she needed. I still apologize for not realizing at the time though and ask if we can start over and take it slow. 

Long story short she says she's not ready for a relationship and she needs time to heal and focus on herself. I told her that was alright, and then I told her I would wait for her for when she was ready. And we ended up coming to a deal where if either of us has someone ""special"" come in our lives there would be no hard feelings. Yet if not I would wait until she is ready for a relationship and we would try again.

I am much more sure of myself and have been working on communicating and saying what I'm feeling. I feel we both have both grown a lot in the last 6 months. And I am very serious and plan on waiting for her as she is an amazing girl that I feel is the only one in the world for me. I also suggest we still hang out as friends in the mean time though. 

The advice I need is that now after we made that deal she has been a little distant from me. We have tentative plans to go roller skating soon but she often does not text me back for 12 hours. I know that she might just need time away from me to continue to heal, but it still feels elusive. 

My question is why is she acting this way around me but when we are hanging together we are always laughing and having fun?

I was upfront the next morning that I was pretty upset the previous night felt all one way. She clearly felt bad and apologized verbally. We did fool around once more later on the trip in a more equal way but it was very short. I think this initial disappointment led me to try and seek out more intimacy over the rest of the trip in an effort to confirm this one way thing wouldn't be a pattern with her. She came right out toward the end of the trip and said she felt like I was suffocating her a bit with affection and reminded me of her low sex drive.

What do I do? Her and I had a lengthy discussion about this but I don't feel like any concrete solution was reached. I am okay not being intimate all the time but in order for that to work, I feel like the opportunities her and I have to be intimate can't leave me feeling things are one way or that I might need additional validation. I otherwise really like this girl.

She is old enough to be my own mother as I graduated high school in the same class as her son. She is a super nice lady, so I never use to think much of what she said to me and still don't to a certain extent. I'm obviously close to my best friend, whom she loves, and am close with her daughter as well (his girlfriend), so I kinda just chalked her being very nice to me up to that. The first comment that made me raise my eyebrows a bit was over the past summer. Her daughter picked up my best friend from a wedding we were at, and I helped her get him into her car and calm him down due to him being too drunk. Supposedly after she was told how I helped, she said, ""He's so nice. I wish he was 20 years older."" Regardless, I didn't really read too much into it. On New Years a few days ago, I spent it hanging out with a few of my friends and their SOs at one of my friend's houses. When she learned about this from her daughter, she made a joke and said that she should come keep me company as I am the single friend of my group. The night went on, and she came to pick up her daughter around 12:30am. We all came out to say goodbye. My one friend was home for the first time in a while so she said something about how she remembered him. She then saw me, giggled, and said, ""oh I definitely remember you."" She was talking about how her date for the night only gave her a hug when she was asked by her daughter, and my under the influence self jokingly said, ""hey I'm just saying I didn't get a kiss either tonight."" She then told me to come over to her side of the car. Everyone was thinking that she was just going to give me a peck on the cheek. I came over, and she grabs my face and plants her lips right on mine and holds me there for a second or two. It definitely caught me off guard and I blushed a bit, but I, along with everyone else, thought it was hilarious. Someone said something about how she was fun and she said something along the lines of, ""I'm completely sober right now, you should see me drunk."" 

For the most part, I do feel like she's just having some harmless fun with me and I think it's funny to play along, but for the past few days, I wanted to see what an unbiased person thought of the whole thing. I don't feel uncomfortable or anything about it.

Late November I confronted her about it, saying she shouldn't date people if she's not over an ex. That it's not fair to the other person to dump her emotional baggage on them. I was very blunt and upset her. Thought I'd never hear from her again.

\- She hasn't found anybody else better online.

\- Alone during the holidays.

\- Feeling the pressure of turning 30 in a couple weeks, single with no kid or boyfriend. 

\- She needs some form of drama to develop an emotional connection. I gave her that when I called her on her bullshit.

It could help to streamline the sort of person you are actually looking for in life, help you iron out what you can and can’t deal with. Makes it easier to decide if you really have a lasting chance with someone.

so new years i worked 12 hrs on the 31st, and had a pm shift on the 1st, amidst a 60 hour workweek. i had no plans but i'd picked up some stuff to make margs and i made bean soup (albeit lacking black-eyeds) during my break. my roommate asked if i'd go to the bar she's a reg at with her, and when we both got off early (10:45) from power closing we both dressed up and went out. i've only been to this bar like 5 times total now but my roomie is there multiple times a week. i ended up having a lot of fun and about 6 people came back with us to our place, everyone was just chilling and a few ate my soup which was cool. there was one dude my roommate knows that i was getting kind of flirty with and by the end of the night we were sitting with our legs touching ahhh. 

i asked my roommate for his number and she said he already asked for mine. i admittedly got impatient waiting but i wanted to ask him on a date. i texted him and it ended up confusing him because apparently anytime i try to flirt i come off as rude or something. but then he texted again last night asking what i was up to, by the time i checked it my roommate had invited me to the bar again so i said ""apparently going to The Bar"" and he said he had been about to leave. 

so i pull up and we're talking and we honestly have a lot in common. we had good conversation and there are other people we were hanging out with which was fun, but then he whispered the magical words ""to be honest do you want to get out of here and just smoke"" so we went back to my place. 

of course, me being at a bar and 20, i have a fake and he had been under the impression i was 23 but i came clean, which did result in him feeling lied to but i can't just go around telling everyone i'm 20 at the bar lol. we ended up having a really open conversation after that because i figured if he was apprehensive i might as well address anything else that could become an issue, which lowkey had him geeking at first but overall was a good convo and he said he'd never experienced someone being so blunt about things, which is something i value about myself in dating. i don't like to play games, i want to be clear and avoid investing in something that is incompatible, so it was cool that i successfully conveyed some baggage in a way that wasn't over sharing and overall eased both his distrust and my personal apprehensions which always exist about whether he actually does respect me or was just looking for sex.

we had a couple rounds of some bomb ass sex and he is leaving for  a backpacking trip in about a month but we're going to hang out until then. i'm on a dopamine high right now. this is actually the first positive sex experience i've had with a new person for awhile, and other than my virginity the first time i met the person organically and not from OLD. i am looking forward to more sex with a man who is also seeking a genuine connection. gonna suck when i have to find someone new but overall this man is once again causing me to raise my standards. no more meaningless hookups and no more men who make me uncomfortable with my boundaries.

We still want to date but I find it really hard because I miss her old self. What can I do to concentrate on myself while I wait she turns back to normal? 

So, my best friend and I have started dating, but we aren't girlfriend and boyfriend, yet, it's a sort of an in-between situation. Anyway, things had been going good, but suddenly she started acting different. She started answering less and less to my texts and to other people's, as well, including other friends in our friend group. 

I initially thought it was for her upcoming exams but after passing them she has still been acting like that; therefore, I confronted her about it and she told me she hasn't been feeling like herself lately, and that she needs some alone time because she feels detached from herself and oberwhelmed. She told me she obviously still cares about me and that she's still there for me, but that she doesn't want to use her phone as much as before at the moment; the problem is I can't seem to accept her situation, although I obviously respect her.

We both hope it's a temporary problem, because when we see each other in person and when we call each other she feels kind of normal, although she's a bit ruder than before, but when texting she doesn't respond even though sometimes she's online.

I'm a bit overthinking the situation, because she has been acting like this with everyone, but I just miss her. Before we started dating we used to text A LOT, and just now I realise how much I miss her telling me about her day.

To add to the context, she has always had some mental health issues so I know she's not faking it, but I just keep overthinking. 

 So what I'm asking is, do you guys have any tips on how not to stress about her and just enjoy the moments when we're together until this situation turns back to normal?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1147162,public,self,"Girl I started dating (she was my best friend) has been acting different due to mental health issues.

After a week, I only get a few matches and they are either morbidly obese women or transgenders. I had much better luck with getting to know attractive young women at school before covid and California gov. ruined everything for me. 

Part of the reason I think dating apps have gone so terrible for men is more men downloading the app post covid. Women simply dont have that same desire to connect as men and so they have been fine during the pandemic. Plus men are notoriously known to swipe right on every profile they see to (cast a wide net) which ultimately inundates women with matches and options causing them to become extraordinarily picky while also losing your profile in her queue.

Are there any alternatives that perhaps limit the number of likes men can send so they dont spam the feature? Or an app that squashes the competition with them by charging you money to use? Im prepared to pay because Im looking for a long run relationship and I hate competing with 4 other (young horny men only interested in a hookup) for every one girl on the app. I need an app that isnt 5:1 men to women like Tinder and Bumble.

I came from a long term relationship that is LDR for 2 years and just back in December of 2021, I decided to actually date someone that is physically near to me. So he came from a 4 years relationship and coincidentally we’ve been single for 4 months.  We talked about our past and we just click and reconnect a lot, but what bothers me the most is that he still talks to his ex for “professional reasons” cause of stock exchange and he doesn’t know how to openly communicate stuff with me because he’s so chill with his ex before. I too, had the same problem with my ex with the communication thing and I decided if ever I wanted to enter another one I would openly communicate what I feel in order to understand each other more. But the guy isn’t used with the confronting thing and doesnt know what to answer to me most of the time which is honestly frustrating, but I honestly just want to understand. So here’s the thing, I keep thinking about his ex  and also the idea of him not deleting their photos but also convincing myself, I’m different, and I just knew that he told his ex, he is already seeing someone which is me. And I dont know if I trust him that much due to the fact i’ve had ups and downs with people before and I might not able to handle another heartbreak for sure. But yea, these are personal problems. But honestly, for a girl who has always been the first girlfriend of every relationship I’ve entered, this is honestly confusing and I don’t know what to do. So any advice, a smack in the head to tell me what I need to do can ease up whatever I’ve been feeling for the past days.

I’ve only made a few of them and had it dedicated to my close family and friends. 

Many of my life lessons were also thanks to my ex-fiancé. We have been split for 2-3 months due to miscommunication, conflicts and disapproving parents (her side). As much as I wanted to save the relationship, she gave up on us. Although during the last month she herself wasn’t behaving as the woman I fell in love with I know most of her reasoning or decisions were not taken solely by her but with influences from her peers and family. 

We have been in NC for the last 2-3 months except this time one time we shared some heart-felt emails. Hers were mostly in a more reserved/angry mood but she had said she loved me and cared for our relationship with all her heart. This was likely a month ago. Although, I’m not sure how someone can give up if they say that… but that’s a different story…

I still believe that her and I can work things out. Someday hopefully. I am just staying out of her zone and trying not to reach out to her to respect and give her the space she needs. I don’t want to bombard her life. She has a lot she needs to figure out too. However…

My questions are:

- Would it be wrong of me to send her the book I had worked on?

- If yes, should I at least message and ask her if it is ok or just mail it?

- If no, would it be just best to wait till she reaches out and then see if she would like to read it depending on which state we are in at that time?
