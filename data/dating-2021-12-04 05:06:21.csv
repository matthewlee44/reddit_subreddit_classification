0,r8nwxk,1638617856,How to handle a partner that is self-sabotaging the relationship?,"I (m,29) recently started dating someone (f, 29). We live in a large west coast city in the US.  


TLDR - the chemistry, connection, and attraction are all very obvious and it's clear that we both want to be with one another.   


However, she is self-sabotaging this relationship in what can come off as a joking way. When I ask her to go out for drinks/dinner or to hang out she will respond with something like:  
""Oh my god are you sure you aren't sick of me yet?!""  
or  
""LOL I can't believe you still like me...""  


You get the idea. These come off as joking but it's clear to see that there is something deeper there. Self-sabotage only creates problems, and eventually creates a self fulfilling prophecy that doesn't need to happen. And I understand that this is most likely based on her past experiences, and that she is using a these words as a defense mechanism to protect herself from the possibility of being hurt. Ultimately I think this boils down to a deeper fear of abandonment that she may have.  


I am not criticizing this. In fact I think it's human nature to keep our guard up and protect ourselves especially when developing deep feelings for someone. Letting ourselves be vulnerable with anyone is an inherently unsafe thing to do because we DO put ourselves in the position to get hurt. So i fully understand they ""why"" behind this behavior.  


How should I handle this? How can I continue to support her and show her love the way she needs to be loved if she is telling herself that I am going to get bored of her?   


I am developing deep feelings for this person and truly do see them as a long term partner. I'd spend more time with her if I could, and I want to re-assure her that my feelings and intentions towards her are authentic and genuine. I want her to know that it's safe expressing her needs and feelings to me and that I will always seek to understand and empathize with her. But it is still challenging to overcome words such as ""You're going to get sick of me"" when I know that is not how I feel.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r8nwxk/how_to_handle_a_partner_that_is_selfsabotaging/

3,r8o562,1638618796,Painful end...,"[SORRY LONG READ]

Hello there, 

I met a girl in Brazil on Tinder back in 2018, at that time we didn't live in the same city but as I went on a road trip with my friends I ended up meeting her anyway as she invited me to go with her to a party. Well, I was sold right away based on her looks but also because of her personality. Unfortunately, I was only for about 6 months in Brazil so she didn't want to start anything with me as we were living far away which is logical off course. 

However, now she is living in Europe now for her study so we agreed on meeting up as we kept in touch during that three years. We had an awesome time together ended up going to various places together and also had sex, kissed etc and I kinda felt we got closer to the point of a relationship. Eventually, I had to leave again to my country again but we kept in touch.

Now, a few weeks later she is visiting my country as she has living friends here as well, so we ended meeting up again and I went with her to her birthday party but she was spending more time with her friends than me which I know she is entitled to as we don't have a relationship. 

This week I talked with her and expressed my feelings and told her I'd like to have more with her. She told me she is not ready for that at the moment but is climbing the hill to get there and wants to know me better as we are only really seeing each other for about two months now she is not there yet. So I told her I respect that and will give her space. We kissed again and that was it.

I took two days free from work as I talked with her about doing some things together so yesterday she told me she  wanted some time with the girls together and I could join later to watch the sunset.

Well, I kinda lost it at that point and told her I'd like to talk with here and that I'm not really in the mood to join the get together. So I talked yesterday with her and told her what my thoughts and feelings are and she told me as I already suspected that she was more as a holiday here for herself... I told her that it's okay and I will give her space and we can see in the future if something is possible for us. She replied that she doesn't want me out of her life and that she doesn't want me to back out hard now but that the boyfriend relationship position is not available at this point. 

I feel so hurt honestly as I was probably way more invested than she ever was. Yet, I don't understand why she did small things this week like putting her head on my shoulder, her arm around me, kissing, playing with my hair etc...

I'm sure though that it is not gonna work.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r8o562/painful_end/
4,r8o6ss,1638618987,I am 21 years old. I have never been on a date before.,"Judging from the Internet and social media, time is ticking. My highschool mates are in relationships in their respective universities. While I am here, being non existent by my overwhelming lack of presence and the inability to speak the language in this abyssmal university.

I am already on my 3rd year. No meaningful friends to hangout with, just acquaintances. The ratio of girls to boys is 1:8 here. That's engineering for you. On top of that, I haven't found anyone I am attracted to.

To further decrease my probability of finding a girlfriend, I live in Pakistan. Those who live here know that it's exponentially difficult to even find anyone holding hands in public.

Furthermore, as per the requirements of women, I honestly do not bring anything to the table. I do not earn yet, I have a repulsive and boring personality as what people have said to me, my social skills are infinitesimal, never gone far than saying ""hey there, how much is the cost?"" to a female cashier, no friends, unmotivated, have no goals for my future. All in all, I am the event horizon of the abyss. A depressing sack of shit. A pile of red flags.

The more time goes by, the more inexperienced I become, becoming undesirable to women and being weeded out by women.

The only order that I have got going for me is I go to the gym, take care of my physical image to compensate my ugly personality (sometimes I question whether it even makes a difference), explore and take pictures of urban abandoned buildings and clean my lonely and gloomy apartment room. Cleaning and gym stabilises my mental state. I guess picture taking of abandoned buildings is what you call a hobby.

I am genuinely afraid of being left alone. I long for someone to hangout with, to listen to someone's day. I am trying to come into terms that I'm gonna be living alone and have to hire a prostitute for 4th time. (I failed to lose my virginity three times because of ED).

1st date: went up hugged him said I am a hugger-I was super warm

I carried the whole convo tried to make some lights jokes to lighten the mood he seemed not into it. I thought the date went on for at least 2 hours-I cut it but it only lasted an hour and said I had another thing to do. I thought hard about it and I do not think he asked me one original question-never filled any brief silences-I did. He liked me and asked for the date.. he asked me out quick on the app never asked me about hobbies etc there were so many questions I asked he could have such as hobbies. I left the date feeling exhausted and drained. He asked me for my no. He was well dressed on the date offer to buy me coffee-but I chose to buy my own. He was on time. Cute looking guy. I dont see why he would be nervous considering I was so warm and smily with him on the date so encouraging. He told me on the second date you seem very patient.

Texts me a lot he was pepping me up does seem like a lovely guy asks to call me-At first I thought did he just wake up from a nap-I was like is he interested. At the end of the call he said I really like you I think your cool. I was like ummm how the first date was NOT GOOD and I def would not be saying I liked him-but I did cause I felt so awkward/trying to be polite.

2nd date- better convo he told me he was nervous on the first date seems like a nice guy he just seems nervous still a lil I think he felt like he needed to impress me more on this date. Asked to kiss me french kissed me hardddd-tongue from the beginning. I just felt like he is trying so hard to impress me after the first date-that it feels kinda exhausting and forced. Like then he messages me saying I like you i am distracted at work thinking about u. I just dont know if this guy is fun or if I can have fun with him-he seems more nervous and shy. It was outdoor mini golf and he brought me an extra bottle of water and sunscreen, which i thought was cute.

my feelings are just not quite there tho. We agreed to a 3rd date, which I was thinking of cancelling i felt like i distanced myself this week then he messages to say how my week. I said busy he said wanna call and talk about it. has been and that he bought tickets to go ice skating which kinda annoyed me bc I was thinknig of cancelling and I feel like he did this to ensure I went on the third date

I like how he treats me and supports me with my work etc telling me good luck etc but I just feel he is rushing things saying he likes me after a crap 1 hour coffee date, which he all but acknowledged on the second. I wasn't gonna bring it up but he did. I appreciate him telling me he was nervous?

He just finished law school. I work in law full-time and am studying for ""the bar"" and he is only working 2 days a week and has said he is bored. I feel like I am the centre of his universe.

What would you do? just feel confused

I do not think he was in a previous abusive relationship-he has gushy posts about his ex but seems like they broke up in 2020

&amp;#x200B;

I am just worried I may be giving up a nice guy I just feel like he is saying things that cannot be true like me after crap 1 hour coffee date and i feel a bit suffocated",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r8ozto/would_you_keep_seeing_this_person_not_sure_how_to/
8,r8p2du,1638622340,Ghosted after tinder sex,"
Hello everyone! First of all, I apologize for my bad English. I anticipate that I am not into dating apps like tinder and until last Monday I have never seen a girl in person after matching with them.
I matched with this girl on tinder who is 22 on Sunday night and texted her. From the very beginning, she seemed collaborative and willing to have a conversation so I promised to text her the next day. When I texted her on Monday I ask her out for a drink but she invited me to her place instead.
I got to her place and after 30 minutes we were making out and eventually had sex for 1 hour and half (with a lot of foreplays included such as licking and fingering). After sex, we cuddled and kissed and ordered a  pizza with an enjoyable chat and she ask me to not disappear as others did and that she enjoyed the sex(especially my endurance).
The next day I texted her saying that I enjoyed the time and she replied the same. From that moment she began to ghost me.  Then I sent her a text on Friday asking for explanations and she replied me saying that at this moment she has so many problems with her life to engage or date someone and eventually hurt them. 
I truly believe that‚Äôs all some kind of bullshit and I fear that the real reason is my 5.5 inches penis. I have never been dumped so bad after having sex with a girl so quickly and the feeling sucks and is killing all my self-esteem.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r8p2du/ghosted_after_tinder_sex/
9,r8p5j1,1638622677,"I asked a guy out, and it is life-changing for me even he will refuse.","Hi! 

I am 26, F. I struggled all my life with low self-esteem, social awkwardness, shyness. Also, I am perceived most of the time as cold and distant. I socially isolated myself for almost one year and a half after high school (only interacted with my parents). I struggled with depression for more than 10-9 years, and I still struggle, but now I keep fighting. A lot of this was caused by my alcoholic father, but I am trying to get better...at life and people. I have friends (no idea how), I managed to get a chemical engineering degree, and now I am finally pursuing my master's degree in a lovely country. 

My only romantic-sexual relationship was four years ago with a guy who lied at the end of the relationship that he had leukemia. Additionally, I found out he cheated on me with at least two girls. And, from a reliable source, I found out he was diagnosed with Narcissistic personality disorder... so yeah, that was a fuckin emotionally draining experience. Anyways... I rarely have crushes, I rarely have interest in being in a relationship or any sexual/romantic interaction, because I enjoy solitude. Me getting in a relationship with this manipulative individual was because we were close friends for years beforehand, so naively I thought it is going to be a good choice. Well, my rational self is stupid sometimes, but this is how we learn to smell the spiritual rottenness of one. 

Fast-forward: I moved to a nordic European country four months ago for my studies. At this moment, I have a temporary student job at my university‚Äôs coffee shop (is a place made by students for students). Of course, I am friendly, polite with all the customers. There was one guy that caught my interest, and for certain reasons (a lot to write about) I felt this guy also might be interested in me. He seemed shy and I was sure he will never make a move. The thing is that I work on the second campus where I do not have lectures, but he has all his lectures at this campus, therefore we only met when I was at work or randomly at parties. Also, because exams are coming now, and the winter break is coming, it will be very easy for him to avoid me if I made him feel embarrassed in any way with my first move. So, knowing this, yesterday I was like ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù, I will do this premiere in my life and ask this guy out. I wrote on a paper my number, I told him to text me after the exams if he wants to grab a drink, and I also told him that if he does not want to, just to take this invitation as a compliment. 

I feel it my bones that he will not write to me. But I am glad that I did this. It felt amazing to have the boldness to approach this guy. The rush of adrenaline, goddamn, guys. I felt like I was 15 years again. And, I hope I made his day in a way, and that he will feel complimented by this. Even if he will not text me (because of the shyness, because he is not interested, or other reasons), I hope this approach will self boost his confidence, and when he will meet a girl that he will really like he will have the courage to make the first move. 

Likewise, I have some male friends and I know from them how hard is sometimes to ask someone out, so I am sure that I will not wait around anymore in the future and I will ask out whoever I want whenever it feels appropriate. It will make the process easier for the guy and me too. 

I feel bad in a way that I had this courage at 26 years old, but it is better late than never.

She came over that same day after we talked about what happened earlier and she made it clear that she still wants us to date but I just wake up feeling depressed confused and in fact missing her but I feel like from seeing that she could not be around much longer so I should just enjoy it while she‚Äôs here and I really don‚Äôt want it to come out of nowhere that she doesn‚Äôt want to be with me anymore because there‚Äôs somebody else.

I‚Äôve had countless issues with trusting her since we decided to try and move forward. I feel like her words don‚Äôt match her actions and when she goes hours without responding to me it makes me wonder if she‚Äôs talking to someone else and then she always calls me and apologizes for being busy at work and not getting back to me as quickly as she can which I find odd given that she works from home she could take about 3-4 hours to respond to me at times. There‚Äôs always a drought between our communication which I‚Äôve brought up to her and we talked about. I told her trust and communication is an important thing if we are going to be in a relationship and we both agreed that it‚Äôs too soon anyways for us to be in a relationship. Lately I‚Äôve just had a lot of anxiety and gut feelings lately that are drawing me in to leave and I just feel like the reason why im sticking around this long is that the gaslighting she does by making me stay and saying I‚Äôm the one she wants and is taking me serious as I feel I can‚Äôt trust her. What I‚Äôve found really odd lately is when I go to use the bathroom it‚Äôs her most convenient time to use her phone when she‚Äôs with me she won‚Äôt use it right by me but when I come back from the bathroom I always see her on her phone. She called me up yesterday apologizing and saying that she‚Äôs sorry for taking too long to respond to me and she offered to want to see me tonight so I‚Äôm wondering if I should just feel things out and if I‚Äôm not feeling up to her I should just tell her that this isn‚Äôt going to work anymore but yeah I feel like she will be upset and try to talk me into staying with her again but I have my trust issues with her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r8pc5e/is_it_worth_ending_things_due_to_trust_issues/

Talked for hours on the day we matched and then moved off the app that night. We proceed to talk for a few more days and then I asked her out. She told me that she couldn't go out that week because of different deadlines that she has. I was like ok no problem and we continue to talk.

A few weeks later she tells me that she really doesn't know what she's looking for but thinks that I'm a really nice guy. I'm like ok well this is surprising since on my profile I have it stated that I'm looking for a relationship. We continue to talk for a few more weeks and at this point I'm just curious what's going on? So, I asked her exactly that. Basically, I asked if she has no interest in going out with me or if she's just not ready to date yet cause honestly at this point we've been talking for over a month and a half and I'm just curious where things stand cause I don't want to waste my time. 

She comes back to me saying that she doesn't want to go out with me because I messaged her too much. I'm just like wait what? I thought the whole point of online dating is to talk to someone to go on date with them. Plus, after the first day we didn't even talk as much so I'm just like how am I sending too many messages? So, we basically talk about this for a few hours and essentially she thought that I was moving too fast. I'm kind of scratching my head at this cause honestly most people say you should ask the other person on a date within the first 2-3 days of matching. So, I'm explaining all of this to her and apologize for making her feel overwhelmed cause that certainly wasn't my intention. And that was that, she doesn't want to take things any further because it's all moving too fast...

I've seriously never heard of someone thinking that talking and asking someone out on a date within the first few days was taking things too fast... From my understanding, that's the whole point of online dating and the way things are on these apps.

She called 3 times last night.  He wouldn't answer the phone and wouldn't let me see his text messages.  He told me to stop being suspicious and jealous, that I have to trust him.  I feel crazy.

20,r8q3pm,1638625947,Don't feel like getting out of bed today. Date cancelled and other issues. 28m,"So im talking to several women. Mostly meeting on OLD. 

I'm going to try to be as brief as I can. Would be too long of a read, but sorry still ended up long. 

So I've been on two dates with one girl who I really clicked with. But 2nd date she vented to me about another guy she likes that she had to break it off with. Really weird date and we talked about it after. We couldn't see each other again for two weeks so I thought the break would be good. Well it had been two weeks so we started chatting a bit over text. She seemed interested in a call but kept saying she was too busy. She told me twice she would check her availability for the weekend and never got back with me. I am texting her later today to basically break it off unless she wants somehow prove she is interested. She doesn't seem available. I am bummed out about it. She had been the best connection I'd had for a long time, but turning into a waste of my time tbh. 

I suddenly got lots of matches and two of them actually have been really good. Unfortunately one girl couldn't meet for a while. I think next Saturday we can meet. I'm following up with her today. She has been very respectful and explained her week and said she wished she wasn't so busy. 

The other girl I had a date with today. I was very excited about it. She seems insanely cute and nice. She texted me last night and said she wasn't in a good place to date at the moment and wondered if I'd like to try after the holidays. I respect that and will definitely reach out. But that just really made me sad last night. Now I got nothing today. 

And the rest of the people I'm talking to are either ghosting me or taking a very long time to respond. 

I guess after several months of dating I was excited about the one girl I'm having to let go today and the one thing that made it better was a very promising date today that is now cancelled. 

I guess I still have a potential date next weekend. 

I guess I'm just having bad luck with people who aren't very available for whatever reason. 

I mean I guess its a good thing to have potential dates then nothing, but when this type of stuff keeps happening I am not sure if it's better to just lay in my bed all day",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r8q3pm/dont_feel_like_getting_out_of_bed_today_date/

He was nice, but I didn‚Äôt feel attracted to him. He kept telling me that I was extremely beautiful and his type, and touched me on the arm an upwards of 20 times, which is the most I‚Äôve ever been touched by a stranger.

I felt kind of bad that I didn‚Äôt want to date him, and so I told him I didn‚Äôt feel a romantic connection but asked him if he wanted to be friends. He said he felt the same romantically but didn‚Äôt see us  as friends. 

I had to ask him why he kept touching me! It felt super weird as I didn‚Äôt reciprocate once! He told me he didn‚Äôt want to do an analysis of the date, and I responded that I just meant on the arm, but no problem best wishes, and he told me he didn‚Äôt want to engage with me at all. I said ‚Äúhaha okay sorry, best wishes with dating!‚Äù which was totally ignored.

The above was communicated in 7 messages total from both of us over 1-2 minutes, so I wasn‚Äôt spamming him/wouldn‚Äôt message again.

But yesterday I received a call and it was him. I usually just cut contact with anyone toxic, ignoring them like I did with a guy I briefly talked too. 

Maybe it was due to how bad of a day I had yesterday but I caved and I called him back soon after.

He told me about how he felt we both needed to grow, and how he missed me and he‚Äôs got a promotion, new house ect and how still thinks about me. How I was the only one who really cared.

He asked if we could be friends and I said I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good idea. Hung up and asked my sister to block him for good.

I‚Äôve (21F) been in this relationship for almost a year and we‚Äôve been doing ldrs for the last 4 months. 

A little back before we started ldrs, he (20M) was very stressed and would be cold towards me. He didn‚Äôt cheat or anything, he made a very explicit comment exchange with a girl friend of his ,on his fb post. At that time we just started started having sex and finally met.He was cold and  would be a jerk sometimes and I honestly started to regret doing it with him( it was my first) .I get that he was stressed  but I don‚Äôt think I should have forgave those behaviors.

So back to the comment thing,I asked him to delete that comment and unfriend her ,which he thought I was overreacting and told me it was normal for friends to joke about sexual stuff on comment sections. (Like they‚Äôre just being open )(I felt like they had no boundaries .
Aside from me overreacting over the matter ,one thing I know, he‚Äôd flip out and get angry with me if I did the exact same thing. He‚Äôd be very upset and would tell me I‚Äôm crossing a line which I think is reasonable reaction.

He did unfriend her on that account but he talked to her about me not liking it how they commented and still keeps her on his other fb accounts.I feel like I was a kid who was given a candy to keep quiet about it after being beaten. 

Another thing, he has an ig acc made saying he wants the following and follower to be me only and I thought well since he wants to ,it‚Äôs okay. But recently I found out he has another acc full of his friends and all. 
I don‚Äôt mind him having extra accounts but it feels really bad and sad when he‚Äôd label stuff to be sweet and when he would unfriend that girl in one acc but won‚Äôt in other acc+social media.

I know these problems aren‚Äôt big, I always feel weird about it and it keeps lingering in my head. If I was him ,I‚Äôd completely cut the girl off my life after seeing how upset and hurt I got. 

TLDR: bf has several fb and Ig accounts. Made sexually explicit comment exchange with one of his girl friend which got me hurt and sad so I asked him to unfriend her , but he only unfriended her in the account I‚Äôm friends with him with. Has her in other social medias.

39,r8s7ks,1638632437,I completely regret breaking up with my girlfriend,"We had been dating for about a few months after high-school and had only been official for about a month. Throughout high-school we had never really talked at all, hence every bodies shock when we started dating. My school is quite small so essentially the entire school knew we were dating.

During the periods when we were just talking I recall friends and people around school constantly questioning me dating her. I know their opinions shouldn't have any sway on my relationship, but they did begin to pile up and make me questions the potential for a relationship her. This feeling was exacerbated by my own brother who questioned why I was even talking to her. Despite their tactless remarks I kept talking to her and found myself to enjoying her company. However, in the back of my mind I constantly heard this voice asking why I'm with her.

I know this next statement is going to make me sound foolish, but when she mentioned that her parents got married straight out of high-school it freaked me out. Did she believe that was a possibility for us? I had no intention of trying to entertain this, it just scared me so much. 

In retrospect there was nothing wrong with the relationship, she did nothing wrong. I think the combination of over listening to external opinions and self-doubt really pushed me over the edge. I had little to no confidence in the relationship. 

I was barely seeing her due to lacking a car and distance between us. It reached a point such that when uni was starting I just thought to myself ""I will find better girls at university"". At the time I did not realise how narcissistic this thought was. I feel incredibly guilty for even believing something like that. 

I felt pressured to dump her before going to uni so when I talked to other girls I didn't feel guilty. Again another huge mistake. Worse, I didn't even have the balls to do it in person, instead sending a shameful text message detailing why the relationship didn't work out. When she requested we call to talk about this, she was crying a lot on the phone, understandably. It was only then that I began to think that yes I had made a mistake, but I don't think the gravity of it had truly set in. 

Every. Single. Time. I think about our relationship I am swept with a wave of unresolved guilt. That I know I can do nothing about. 1 year and 9 months later I know no one deserves to be treated the way I treated her. I don't blame her for what happened at all and despite me bringing up what I believe were influences in my decision the fault lies with me. I want to say I'm sorry, but I don't think I even deserve that. I was a jerk, but I am no longer the person I once was. I just feel guilty about the whole ordeal and am not sure what to do with these emotions. 

TL;DR - Broke a kind girl's heart, for no reason other than my selfishness. I don't know how deal with guilt.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r8s7ks/i_completely_regret_breaking_up_with_my_girlfriend/

42,r8scxs,1638632870,Should I (19M) anonymously confess a crush to a public Instagram crushes page?,"All of this happened yesterday.

I am in university and the marching band. There's a crushes page on Instagram for my university. How it works: you message the account an anonymous confession of your crush, and it gets posted on their page.

Well, apparently someone in the marching band had a crush on another band member. Someone found the post and posted it on the marching band's Facebook meme page. Everyone thought: Hmmm, interesting.....

Then it happened again. Another band member had a crush on another band member, and that got posted on the meme page. And again. And again. Someone even went as far as to create an entirely SEPERATE crushes account SPECIFICALLY for the marching band, that works the same way as the main crushes page for my university.

Now all the band members are freaking out. All of a sudden now everyone's noticing a trend and interested in finding out who's crushing on who and spilling the tea.

I was wondering if I should do the same myself and anonymously confess a crush (whether real or fake) to either of the crush pages. On the one hand, I might enjoy being showered with likes and comments and recognition from my band peers for having my anonymous confession posted on their page. But on the other hand, it may not make sense from a dating point of view, because it may become awkward if other people find out who I like and especially if it's on a public Instagram page for all to see.

I feel uncomfortable telling other people who I like because I'm afraid those people would tell it to their friends and their friends would tell others and so on until the other person knows. I've had many bad experiences with that. During my high school crushes I often told other people who I liked and it made things very awkward. Many of these crushes didn't end well. But, I think, if everyone's anonymously confessing their crushes on a public Instagram page, why can't I?

I was wondering if it would be a good idea for me to anonymously confess a crush to the public Instagram crush pages. Answers are appreciated.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r8scxs/should_i_19m_anonymously_confess_a_crush_to_a/

Often when dating from dating apps I get mixed signals from girls. I don't like games, so I'm normally quite straightforward with them with my intentions and if like them or not. It normally goes like this for me:  


1. We match on Tinder/Bumble
2. We talk a lot, laugh and share life stories
3. Girl suggests/hints she wants to meet
4. We go on a date
5. After the date, when I like the girl I text her saying that I appreciated her and would like to see her again
6. We keep talking and being nice to each other
7. I ask her out, she never can go
8. 6 and 7 repeat.

I'm not quite sure what I do wrong, but it is kinda frustrating. Sometimes I feel like I'm supposed to play games and not communicate how I feel. I've been dating for eight months now, and it happens quite often. 

I'm 26 and normally date girls between 22 and 25.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r8spnl/i_need_help_what_to_do_with_mixed_signals/

50,r8t227,1638634859,Does he want something serious or should I move on?,"This guy messaged me first quite a few times before I had responded on Instagram. I then realised it was a few months and I hadn‚Äôt responded so I messaged him. We spoke for probably a whole month before the meeting. He has offered breakfast/study dates before too. We ended up going out for dinner. Had very good chats, seems like a really lovely guy and nothing sexual.

Some cute messages to each other, like him sending me photos of what he does for work and him telling me that he often thinks about me. He told me he was a bit nervous before picking me up. He picked me up from my house and before he got to mine, he texted me saying would I like him to meet my parents or just pick me up. He paid for dinner and it went really well in terms of chats, felt like a really caring and respectful guy, talked about family and all those nice things. One thing is that he takes great interest in my life and wants to make things easier for me (or so it feels at times), for example wanting to help me out with studying etc.

He dropped me home and did not indicate anything about going back to his which was good. He asked if I would like to do this again and I said yes. When we got back to my house to drop me home, my mother was just coming home and he waited and said hello to her. He then said she was lovely. I could tell he wanted to kiss as he sort of just kept looking at me, I said something and then we kissed. He messaged me a few hours later thanking me, kept in on and off-contact for the week, he told me he was tired but good. He asked about my plans for the weekend and I did the same, he is very busy and works in the medical field. He hasn‚Äôt mentioned anything about catching up again. He asked about a job interview over the weekend and I didn‚Äôt respond till about 5 days later.

In one of our messages, I sort of implied that I wasn‚Äôt sure when I would be seeing him next and he sent a sweet message saying he hopes to get to know me better and see where things go. That he was busy but should have more time once exams are finished and that he does want to see me again. I told him I supported him and that I don‚Äôt expect him to keep in contact.

He initiates a lot and has initiated predominately. He‚Äôll message, we‚Äôll talk for a bit and then maybe I won‚Äôt respond if it doesn‚Äôt require a response and then he‚Äôll send a follow-up message asking about something. He asked about studying together. I suggested we should go to the beach/study together. He asked me a few other questions, asking where the apartment is etc as I‚Äôm probably buying one soon. He‚Äôs currently in quarantine and we‚Äôve been messaging a fair bit, him following up if I don‚Äôt respond etc. He told me about some job offers he took, asking what we want to do when we catch up. Today, he asked me about what I‚Äôm looking for (to clarify) as he has to move away which is about 2 hours away with a sad face. Told him I want to see where things go and that I do like him, he agreed to talk in person. Then asked if I‚Äôm looking for someone casual at all, perhaps asked me this as a while back when we were talking, I said I probably didn‚Äôt have the capacity for anything serious but would be open to it. He questioned at the time and said ‚ÄòI thought you were looking for something serious?‚Äô I said not pursuing something casual but the same for a relationship. He agreed to see how things go.

So there's not much hear as far as singles.Population is skewed older and happily married.I've went to bars every friday I've had off.Went to the small local coffe shops a few towns over.Not realy any meet ups.Not much in the way of social hobbies around here Except for drinking and bowling.Not a fan of either.Area's great for outdoor stuff but most of my outdoor hobbies are solo...and again no meet ups.

So dusted off the dating apps.Set it all up.Set it to 10 miles.Swiped thought 10 people...Can't find anyone.15 miles,10 more and can't find anyone.I continue doing this over the course of the month.Get a few matches here and there.Go on a couple dates.They fizzle out for one reason or another.To the point where I'm at 75 miles.

Where I'm geographical starting to touch some major cities.And the matches start pouring in like a hurricane running though south florida.I think sweet,awsome were back in buisness.

So I start getting a little Pickeyer talk to and set up dates with a few women.Quality over quantity.What I can manage with my time off and the weather.

First one talk to for a few days.Set up a date close to them.1hr 30 minutes round trip drive.Head out ""see you at the restaurant"".I wait a half an hr and get something to eat.Text her an never hear back.

Next one a few days later. same story.but it's a 2hr drive round trip 

Getting kind of annoyed so I take some time to step away from the dating aps for about a week.First woman after I get back to it.Lives 10 miles away.Normal looking but pretty.
I talk a bit and set up a date at a local specialty pizza place.Right by the movie theater and a bar so we got options if it goes well.Double check we were still on an hr or two before.Got there, got a table...Waitress asked if I wanted to order.

However, I have done it in my last two relationships, and I am starting to wonder if maybe I am being too picky. The first one was with a gorgeous girl, maybe normal for everyone else, but a 10/10 in my eyes. We dated for almost a year, but she was being incredibly clingy, and our conversations just didn't flow. We were literally asking what are our favourite colours just to keep a conversation. And she was also incredibly jealous when I am the most loyal guy. So I pulled back and for other reasons, related to me giving her less attention, I broke it off(because it was basically either that or me getting cheated on)
The next relationship was much shorter, only a couple weeks, with a girl who was for me really unattractive but had the best connection with. We were finishing each other's sentences, similar interests sense of humour etc. But I just couldn't get over the fact that when I am out at the street, literally every girl is better looking. Like I would literally try to tell myself it is okay, there are less attractive girls that her outside. And I look, and there are none. So unless I was very horny and on no fap for weeks I couldn't do anything with her, so I broke up again.

So here's the deal, is this me being too picky or just bad luck?

TLDR: Broke up with a 10/10 girl who sucked communication wise, then got with a great girl communication wise, but broke up because she was really unattractive for me. Am I being too picky?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r8t9xy/are_my_standards_too_high/

Although we don't talk about sex that often, I began to worry about her recently regarding her dating and sex life. 

She has a boyfriend who has been with her for 3 months and she found out that he had cheated on her. Of course, they immediately broke up, but she revealed that she is maintaining so- called ""fuck buddy"" or ""friends with benefit"" relationship with him. I literally jumped out off the chair and yelled at her like ""What the hell are you doing ma girl? Dicks are abundant and why you'd keep that trash like that?? Dump him!"" 

She answered like ""I actually didn't care if he cheat or not. I don't give a shit about cheating. I also have cheated on my ex boyfriends. Actually , I love his face and body. He is so hot and what I want is just his body and that's it.  

I answered ""If you really don't give a shit about cheating then you don't need to break up with him don't ya? Why did you change the label from relationship to fuckbuddy in the first place?""

She said ""No,No you are not getting it. It's true that I don't give a fuck if my SO cheats or not but, if he cheats, I will break up. It's a totally different thing"" 

I just lost my words and changed the subjects. Redditors, is it really possible for someone to be a fuckbuddy with their SO who had cheated on them??

I (25f) am a deeply romantic person, raised on rom-coms from the 1930s.

57,r8tssg,1638636940,Was he flirting? What should I do?,"I (19 F) met a boy at a club through a mutual friend. We were all dancing (like 8 people) and he approached me and asked me about in what course of uni I was, and after he said he just wanted an excuse to talk to me. We chatted for a while and then he went to get a drink with his friends. After that, our mutual friend came to me and told me to shoot my shot, but I'm very shy so I just did nothing. This friend kinda tried to force things between us by like graving both of us and bringing us together and so on, and we were both just feeling awkward I guess (keep in mind I didn't even have a drink so I was way to sober for that) and we didn't talk after that. When the club was closing he invited my friends and I back to his place but for several reasons we didn't go.

Fast forward to yesterday and I saw him at the club again. He said he didn't remember my friends but he remembered me, we said hi but we didn't talk more and he pretty much paid me no attention even though we were on the same group of people and I was dancing by his side several times. I also didn't say anything.

Do you guys think he has no interest? I think maybe what happened is I didn't reciprocate enough, but it is also possible that he was just being friendly the first night or something. So what should I do? Approach him the next time? Forget all about it?

64,r8ujzv,1638639081,Couldn‚Äôt get it up and now she feels super insecure,"TL; DR at the bottom

So the other day I‚Äôve [25M] been on a date with a girl that I consider extremely pretty, like 11/10. She was super sweet and we had a lot of fun. We came back to my place and after a while we started kissing and things heated up quite quickly. 

Before I go on with this story, it‚Äôs important to know that i‚Äôve recently had a depression (now feeling 100x better) and the doctor put me on this antidepressant medication that made me lose all libido and sensibility down there. Even masturbation is difficult as it takes effort to keep it up and stay horny. 

So anyway, I wasn‚Äôt anxious but in the moment I started doubting I would be able to get it up. I ""took care"" of her in hope that I would get an erection as it‚Äôs normally the case but nothing. At some point she put her hands down my pants and I stopped as she noticed I was soft. She even pulled them down and I kind of felt humiliated laying there naked and not erect. I explained to her that it wasn‚Äôt going to happen and that I was too anxious (white lie).

We got dressed and she wouldn‚Äôt stop asking what she did wrong. I kept telling her she was really sexy and it wasn‚Äôt her fault. I didn‚Äôt want her to know but eventually I had to tell her I was on medication and that I was 110% sure it was the cause. She ended saying it was alright.

I dropped her off at her house and I really felt like shit, humiliated and mad after the whole anti-depressant situation.

Talked to my doctor and I stopped taking them and I can legitimately feel my libido coming back. Now here‚Äôs the thing. She called me drunk and crying, talking shit and cursing at me, saying that I was lying. Once more I explained how it wasn‚Äôt her fault or even mine but wouldn‚Äôt listen. 

I understand what must go through a woman‚Äôs head when this happens, but this genuinely made me feel even worse and now i‚Äôm super scared to hurt someone‚Äôs feelings if it happens again. Chances are it will as it puts even more performance expectations and results in anxiety.

I‚Äôm mad that some people still do not understand that men are not fuck machines that can get it up on command. That it can sometimes happen and it‚Äôs perfectly normal. This keeps this cycle going and it stays a taboo in society.

What else can I say to make her understand what happened as she is obviously offended even though she said she didn‚Äôt mind? I don‚Äôt plan on seeing her again. Should I even talk to her? I feel like people need to be aware of this reality.

tl;dr: Didn‚Äôt get an erection because of a medication and now my date feels super insecure and offended no matter what I tell her. Should I even bother explaining again after she cried on the phone?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r8ujzv/couldnt_get_it_up_and_now_she_feels_super_insecure/

75,r8vpgo,1638642303,"My crush confessed her feelings to me, I don't know what to do now that we're dating"," A girl I've liked for the past few months sent me a message on Thursday that essentially said she liked me. I replied and told her that I'm glad she told me this and that I feel the same way. Her reaction to me saying that was ""OH THANK GOD"", so like relieved and happy. She went on for a bit about how I made it really obvious I liked her. Until I eventually asked If me and her are dating now. To which she replied ""Well yea"". So me and her messaged a bit after and she joined a call with me and my friend for a couple hours.   


  
Anyways, Friday came around and me and her texted a bit before I went to school to see her. I honestly didn't really know what to expect. Me and her messaged using google chat (or whatever its called) during class for a bit, since we don't really see each other much until lunch and after. We normally talk to each other A LOT more over google chat but not much that day. So fast-forward to lunch. Uh, when lunch started I saw her but we didn't really talk. It was just sorta quiet. That's the issue.  


  
I expected us to talk a lot more since everything that happened the day before. Uhh, when we got home I messaged her asking if she was alright cause she wasn't talking much today, She just said she was super tired.  That was yesterday, and me and her have texted but not much. I know she doesn't like texting much, nor do I. Since me and hers connection is so much better in person. I just don't know if it means anything that like, me and didn't speak much the day after we started dating. And if it means anything that we aren't even like, texting much.

83,r8wh88,1638644440,Surprised by how tiring dating is,"I \[M24\] have never used dating apps before, but recently downloaded tinder and have been on a few dates. I¬¥ve met up with two girls. Both times we went on three dates (once per week), after which we mutually decided to not keep seeing each other.  While the dates have been pleasant and no feelings have been hurt, I¬¥m surprised by how emotionally demanding dating is. After deciding not to continue seeing the first girl,  I didn¬¥t even open the app for a few weeks because everything about dating just turned me off.  Now, after the same scenario happened again, just the thought of starting over with someone new makes me exhausted. 

I think one reason might be that I only speak to/date one person at a time. If I already have a date lined up, I don¬¥t respond to any messages I get because I can only focus on one person at a time. I¬¥ve always been this way, and it¬¥s not something I want to change, because I think it¬¥s a good trait when you meet the right person.

&amp;#x200B;

Don¬¥t get me wrong, I¬¥m thankful that my online dating experience has been mostly positive so far.

So she had him around. Didn‚Äôt even ask if I was comfortable, she just said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs coming here‚Äù and then when it came to it. I had to stand in front of her ex boyfriend and him tell me where I can sleep. She didn‚Äôt see if I was comfortable but then asked me to do that. It was wrote down on the paper ‚Äútell her ex when I sleep over‚Äù she didn‚Äôt fight this at all. When I told her she said ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt going tk let it happen‚Äù it was to keep him happily but in my eyes where I sleep has nothing to do with him and she should of stuck up for me. I told her this and after it becoming an argument she said she‚Äôs make me feel more comfortable and she‚Äôs sorry she didn‚Äôt think that situation would make me feel uncomfortable. 
So tonight, I‚Äôve said if baby sit while she goes out, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs out drinking aswell‚Äù I don‚Äôt mind babysitting while she has fun. But he called her said he‚Äôs having her tomorrow. And then asked ‚Äúwhen is jack sleeping‚Äù and she said tonight and then he said it‚Äôs fine if he sleeps in the bedroom and she said ‚ÄúI know it is‚Äù she again didn‚Äôt stick up for it and say it‚Äôs none of his business. 
When I spoke to her about it she said I did tell him I said ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs alright‚Äù but In my eyes he should be told as she‚Äôs given him this power in the first place, she said I was making a situation out of nothing and then left to go out without saying goodbye or a kiss.

92,r8x7ci,1638646403,Dating dynamics make me really sad,"Whenever I go out to a bar or club(very rarely in the times we live in) I am always left feeling incredibly sad by what I see. There's a particular gut wrenching feeling I get everytime when I realise nobody is watching me, while part of me thinks I might be catching the eye of a cute girl I might have laid eyes on, realistically she hasn't given me a second look. I think of myself as an attractive, affable and kind guy and I always think these traits will radiate but they don't seem to. Whenever we get talking to girls I am always the one on the outside of the conversation, I do try but I always just feel like there's a disconnect between me and the female gender. This seems absurd but I genuinely have no friends who are girls. I had a girlfriend for a year but we got together in very unique circumstances; it kills me to think she probably wouldn't have fallen for me in any other scenario than the serendipitous way that we did. In  a way that makes me cherish the relationship but it also makes me realise that her thoughts on me in that one moment do not suggest that I am a desirable guy that women like.

I was at a bar last night for a live gig(lockdown coming soon so one chance to go out and socialise) and I was one of the shortest guys in the bar at 5 foot 8. I don't care that much about my height but it's like one extra thing to be sad about. Looking around all I could see is happy faces of couples and people flirting and I just felt like such an outsider. I can't flirt I just can't. Social interactions are too fast for me and in fact I find talking just hard to do, it all feels so fake. I spoke to someone about the changing nature of music and the blurring of styles and I was just thinking I'd love to have such a conversation with a girl but it feels they don't like this type of convo. Doesn't matter if it's a hipster girl, a popular girl, an arty girl, they ain't interested in me.

94,r8xfm6,1638647070,My partner is too loud in bed.," I (26M) recently became FWB with a girl (22F). The sex is incredible and we have an amazing time when we get together. She also feels the same way. The thing is, she is very loud in bed and doesn‚Äôt have any restraints about that.   
The past week we had sex two times and both times she was moaning and groaning like we were on another planet and there was no one nearby. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I find it extremely hot. But my neighbors don‚Äôt. My building has very thin walls and I know that my neighbors can definitely hear us. The first time this happened, my neighbor politely told me to keep it down. And that‚Äôs just my neighbor in the adjacent apartment. I‚Äôm pretty sure with the way she was moaning that the apartments above and below mine could hear us as well. Although I have been lucky enough not to bump into the people living in those apartments, I would rather that they not be disturbed. The second time, during the first round of sex, I gently told her to keep it down. During Doggy, she pushed her face into the pillow and that seemed to work for the time being. But then during the subsequent rounds, she told me that she was not going to bother with restraining herself. She told me that she was gonna enjoy herself to the fullest and my neighbors can go to hell. It was mid-coitus and I was thinking with my penis, so I said okay. Then we continued with our sex and I‚Äôm pretty sure the entire street heard her moans. I also know that after we both finished, I could hear my neighbor open the door and go out. I‚Äôm afraid he had enough of the noise and had to step out.  
What can I do to let her know that while I love her moaning, I don't want to disturb my neighbors? I like my neighbor and he tries to keep it down while playing music or having friends over so that he doesn't disturb me. I‚Äôm just trying to return the favor. But I‚Äôm afraid if I tell her once more, she might think that I‚Äôm telling her not to enjoy sex or that I don‚Äôt find her moans sexy. It seems like right now the only option is soundproofing my bedroom :)
