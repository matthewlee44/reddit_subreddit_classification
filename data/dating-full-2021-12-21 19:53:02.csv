I talk to both of them, more so Jackie, but it was really fun.

Anyway, after finals are finally over, I essentially get really drunk and black out with Alicia and a few of our friends in my dorm, and I tell Alicia that I find Ruby extremely attractive. Like I emphasized it a lot. Later, back at my frat house, i see ruby and jackie there but i'm too drunk to really interact with them and i eventually crash. The next day, I see ruby post a picture of her and her friend with me in the background, so i jokingly swipe up abt it saying ""lets goooo"", to which she responds that she'll repost the picture with me tagged. I don't think anything of it and repost her story, she then wishes me a good winter break and i do the same back.

Nothing crazy, but the next day, for some reason, I can't get ruby out of my head. like i don't even know her that well - i've talked to her one time sober before in my life, but for some strange reason I want to date this girl. Not even just hook up with. I have a weird desire to date her. So I looked through her instagram, and I noticed that she had posted a picture with this guy in a few of her posts. Idk if they're dating or anything but they seem to at least be really good friends. Like I haven't seen any ""ILY""s or stuff even remotely flirtatious but they were rly close to each other in one of the photos. How should I approach this situation after break?

It's about an hour drive from the city I live in currently, some people wouldn't consider such distance a long distance relationship, but I do, because of our busy schedules and the fact that I don't drive, which can make me travelling to my parents' house inconvenient.

We started talking and going out a lot in September, he would come see me mostly because he had things to do in my city regarding his work/business. I was really happy in a new city and I wouldn't come back as often to my hometown, I was busy, going to the gym, etc. And I didn't think that anything would happen with him, so I simply didn't put any effort to see him, it was him coming to me. We officially started our relationship in late October. 

I started coming to my hometown more often, I was there all weekends in November, I'd stay a night or two at his place, etc. Everything was perfect. I caught feelings, I wouldn't say I love him, but I do like him a lot, I cherish him and miss him constantly. I think it's a good thing to have feelings for someone, but it's been killing me lately. 

I lost myself a bit, not gonna lie, I abandoned my hobbies and started struggling in university a bit, the university situation has left me extremely stressed and anxious, because I have my exams in January. 

I noticed that he has been very busy with work, and I get it, I'm trying to do the same, get an education and build a future. That's the thing about him that I'm extremely attracted to. I consider myself very ambitious and I hate myself for losing that spark lately and not doing the best on my assignments. 

But the thing is, his effort changed. Maybe it's because of work, I try to be understanding, because I know what it's like to have a lot on your plate. But I miss how things were in the beginning. It's my first relationship, I don't know what to expect. We had a fight over this actually, I expressed that I feel like he doesn't care that much. Because that's how I started feeling. 

I don't know how we're going to close the distance after 4 years, I'm probably going to come back to my hometown which I don't mind actually, because he's close to buying a house there and that's what he wants. He wants to settle down and have a serious future with me, which is definitely worth the wait because I want the same. 

Sometimes we have our doubts, I think it's normal, and we talk openly about them, sometimes I don't know how I'm going to survive 4 years. I think it's okay to be uncertain sometimes.

The thing that's bothering me the most is me coming to my hometown all the time and him not coming to me. I feel like I'm doing all the work, it got tiring. Maybe I expect too much and I'm not appreciating him putting effort in the beginning? Maybe men get a bit tired of doing it all? Obviously I don't expect him to put all the work, the relationship consists of two people, they both have to put effort, I'm just talking about traveling arrangements which have changed. 

It's been messing with my head, university has been messing with my head too, I'm super stressed. He wants me to graduate, he's been understanding, and I'm not going to drop out because of him, I have dreams, he has dreams, and I think that's how it should be. 

How can I help myself? I'm sick of feeling this way. Nothing's going to really change until my exams in January, but after that I'll have more free time and I'm thinking of starting to take care of myself more. I'll start going to the gym again, taking care of my hobbies, maybe something will change if I show him that I have a life without him, working a lot on myself? He broke up with his ex girlfriend because she didn't work or study, had no ambitions and he got tired of it, maybe he changed his effort because he started to see that I'm doing less in my life?

We’ve met up 7 times now and each time since our first date has been a 24 hr + period of spending time at apartments and going exploring. We’ve done a variety of activities together and we’ve each met at least one friend of the other’s so far. 

On our 7th time together, after sex, and right after getting ready to go to sleep which we were now in bed and cozied up, he was telling me about his dog he used to have who died a little over 5 years ago. He mentioned the dog to me before not first time I learned about her. He told me it was traumatizing to have to give his dog (a shared dog from a previous relationship with someone he doesn’t talk to anymore) back to his ex when he moved cities. And that the dog died without him being physically near her. And that his ex keeps a photo of the dog’s dog rage as some profile picture somewhere (he said that he found that traumatizing because the dog is more his  Andre was closer with the dog [is what I got from why that bothered him]) 

While cuddling and telling me about this in the dark I could tell he was tearing up and sniffling a lot. It was obvious he was crying. I had recently hit my dab pen before falling asleep and didn’t expect this depth to come out at this moment. I tried to be there for him, cuddled him more intensely and gently massaged him in a comforting way. He sincerely thanked me while cuddling me really tightly and I let him know that I knew how hard it is to lose a dog. (I do know). I wanted to make sure I didn’t make it in turn about me so I let him have the floor to share so to speak. He apologized for talking so much when we said it was bedtime but I told him that I find him really relaxing to listen to and that it’s nice to listen for a change since I usually share/talk a lot. And I thanked him for sharing something so deep with me.

I actually really like him and find his confidence intimidating at times. 

Did I handle this situation alright and to what degree does it mean he likes me if he is willing to be this vulnerable with me? 

I felt like my voice wasn’t in as calm of a mode as his was and I was in a robotic mode being post sex, post dab pen and exhausted from our adventures we did during the day- but I don’t think he noticed or minded.

We spent nearly 6 hours together and I walked her home, goodbye hugs and a bit of friendly touching but no kiss. 

Now it’s been nearly a week and I still can’t stop thinking about her. I know she’d like to meet again and I’ve received a text from our mutual friend that sort of implied that she saw at least some sort of romantic potential in me (although maybe I read too much into it). My problem is that I won’t be able to see her again for a while, she lives in the city I used to live in (3 hours away from me now) but she’s from another country and is back visiting family over Christmas. And who knows what restrictions they may put on international travel in the new year.

It’s kind of unwritten rule to state this so 17M myself and 18F her. 

I somewhat recently began an entirely online relationship with a girl I’ve known for a handful of years. It kinda began over the summer. She just started messaging me every night usually between 11-2am just to simply chat or what not. Throughout the next couple months our completely normal chats would grow in frequency to the point that we were talking to each other throughout every day and every night. One of her friends at work even dubbed me her, “not boyfriend” due to how much of her free time at work was spent messaging me. 

This kinda put in our heads the idea of a relationship and we’d somewhat discuss it neither really saying much about it. I had in the past made clear my extreme prejudice towards long distance relationships due to every example I’ve witnessed in my life going down in flames (ahaha foreshadowing). Despite this one night right before one of us had convinced which ever one was being stubborn to finally sleep she asked me straight to the point how I felt about her. I told her that I didn’t know and that there was something there, but it didn’t feel like it usually did when I fell for someone, no real fire. I asked her back and she gave a similar answer of uncertainty on her feelings. I woke up the next morning and pretty much immediately realized that I liked this girl I had in the past literally scoffed at the idea of falling for. It took a week to find the courage, but similar as before when one of us was about to finally sleep I asked her if she wanted something more than a friendship. After a bit of back and forth plus a complete misunderstanding of how four square works we ended up agreeing to explore what, “more” could mean. 

Fast forward a bit and we’ve discussed it more. Agreed to keep mutuals unaware of the relationship because it would make things more fun for us, avoid making people feel like third wheels and if this immediately failed we could more easily go back to normal. I had kinda refused to use the titles of boyfriend and girlfriend until we had the opportunity to actually meet up. Eventually though after some convincing and her I guess, “officially” asking me out on a date I relented. 

Then one night as we’re discussing her looming finals she says that she’s having a bit of an identity crisis. I quickly ask what’s up and she says that she thinks she’s Aromantic. A concern she’d somewhat hinted in the past when discussing her mother asking her if she was lesbian. Immediately my mind starts racing with questions and we discuss it a bit. She’s unwilling or unable to really put her thoughts into words so I encourage her to talk to someone other than me seeing as it might be more difficult to explore those feelings honestly with me compared to someone else. She ends up deciding to ask a gay friend of our’s who had earlier on learned of the relationship. She wanted to ask him because he might offer good insight. I decide not to press it until both of us were on break and she didn’t have to worry about finals. After a couple days of waiting I finally ask the question that had been killing me. If she was what would that mean for us. She fills me in a bit on how discussion with our gay friend went and puts her feelings into words. I tell her that I want a romantic relationship with her and that if she doesn’t feel the same way I don’t want to be with someone like that. She asks if we can take a month long break so she can put her head together and we agree despite my misgivings. 

Now I sit after a couple days frustrated, angry, confused and sad unsure what to do. I feel lead on and screwed over. A part of me wants to end it now because there’s no way it ends well. Another part of me refuses to walk away from this no matter the unlikelihood of continuation.

It is often mentioned that boundaries are important and so are compromises in a relationship. However, when we make too many compromises, we eat away our boundaries and if we do it too much - our sense of self.

Why do I see advice everywhere regarding compromises being key to the relationship? Why can't relationship be built on respect for boundaries without the need for compromises? Why can't we do everything we truly want in relationships? Why can't we accept what the other person doesn't want to do and not give them the option of compromising (by doing)? Watching a barbie show with your girlfriend you don't like, watching a football game with your boyfriend you don't like, going to a certain concert you don't enjoy etc.

Of course this doesn't apply to things that are agreed upon to sustain a living - doing housework, payments etc. This is more regarding the communication and activities. Why can't relationship consist of two people who do what they actually want and meet in the middle where they do things for each other they both enjoy?

A relationship where both people never compromise and do what they want to do sounds perfect to me! It's based on pure honesty and can be done with love and respect for the other. You never do what you don't want to and you shouldn't feel pressured just because that would make the other party happy. You never do something with another that they don't enjoy. You do things together/for the other/for yourself that you both enjoy.

I've been trying this approach in my relationships, but I'm yet to find such person. I never insist on doing something the other party doesn't fully enjoy.

I’ve been “talking” with a co-worker of mine (whom I’ve had a crush on for a bit) and I knew that she also had a thing for me. Fast forward a few weeks and we’re sleeping together and having a really good time (gifting each other stuff and borrowing each other’s things as well). Told her that I like her and that we should date (which instantly left a bad taste in my mouth). She says she also wants us to date, but I think it’s too soon for that (that’s why I regretted asking her to date). I think we should take it slow and get to know each other more before an actual commitment can be made (I’ve only known her for a few weeks) and I kind of made the same mistake of getting into a relationship way too quickly with my ex and it ended pretty badly.

One was talking about how his ex would be nothing without his child support money and she gets more money from him than she does working, another was saying how he’s only with his girlfriend of two years because she’s a “consistent hole”, the third was making racist comments about him being the only white guy his girlfriend has been with, and the fourth guy just kind of sat there egging them on. 

As I was sitting there listening to this all I could think of was 1.) how are these guys not completely embarrassed to be talking about women/dating like this 2.) what would they say if their mothers heard them 3.) why does it seem men like this have no issue attracting, getting, tricking, sleeping with, whatever you want to call it, with women?  

Is having this kind of personality really what it takes? I can’t possibly believe they hide it that well from women. Maybe I’m just naive.

It isn’t wanted anymore nowadays but my mom (no I’m not a momma’s boy) raised me to treat women old school, open doors, don’t curse, always offer to pick her up, etc. so it just doesn’t make sense to me.

I've met I think a dozen girls on there so far, after filtering through what feels like hundreds.   None of these meetups have resulted in anything relationship wise, other than it looks like I've made one new friend.  
What has happened on about half of these first time meets is, we have a great time. Good conversation. Fun activities. I try to get to know them on a deeper level than surface stuff. We stay out later than we should.  
The attraction is there so there's hand or arm holding, and inevitably we kiss.  
Then a second meeting never happens. Perhaps we get caught up in the moment, perhaps we've moved too fast, perhaps me or her are starved for affection, either of which can somehow make her turned off the next day. The excuses I've got are, you're not what I'm looking for, you remind me of my ex, the connection just fizzles, or just straight up ghosting.   
It's hard for me not to go for the kiss if I'm feeling it. Part of me thinks if I don't do it, she'll think I don't like her. But another part says hold off it's too soon. Most of my relationships started this way, albeit never from online.   
I remember a girl I went out with twice, I went for the kiss on the second date and she smiled and gave me her cheek. It was actually really cute and certainly kept my interest. Maybe I'm being too easy lol.

We have no idea how we even matched in tinder 

We started talking on tinder for a day and the next day she asked if I wanted to text instead. It wasn’t until she gave me her number and I saw the area code that I realized she wasn’t from here. I saw her tinder profile said 1700 miles away

We both noticed this and talked about how much of a bummer it was. But that didn’t really change anything. We’ve been texting all day for a week almost and yesterday began talking on the phone and FaceTiming. Today she FaceTimed me twice while on her break from work just because it was easier than texting 

I must admit I am head over heels for her. I haven’t felt like this about a woman in sooooooo long. The thing is we’ve been talking so much in running out of new things to say. She called me while she was on a 10 min break. And we kinda just sat in silence while looking at each other haha. Obviously we talked a little about what I was doing. Etc. 

It wasn’t weird, like the usual “awkward silence” wasn’t awkward for me. It was just comfortable silence. 

I’m scared she might think those silences are awkward. Maybe I’m overthinking this.

This guy has a room right next to mine. However, eventually I heard him on the phone talking to another woman and it turns out he's been on/off with this girl for the past 2 years. There are photos of them at the beach and going on dates on Facebook, dating back to 2019.

I guess they were fighting when he first moved in and that's why he cuddled. However, now they are back on STRONG and his girlfriend drives an hour to see him, and she is basically over our house every other night. 

In fact, she was over the WHOLE weekend (I could hear them in his room next door) and she left, but he just called her and told her to come back...so now she's over here ANOTHER night.

I want to tell him how lonely and left out and abandoned I feel, and I wish I could get him to like me again. No one knows how painful it is to just be in my room alone, looking at losers on dating apps when all I want is the guy with a room next door to me. What should I do?

This is also majorly hurting my self esteem because I'm RIGHT next door to this guy and yet he waits for this girl to drive all the way down and she has more stuff she can talk about with him because she's from his hometown, went to high school with him, etc.

Anyway, I photoshopped a photo of her cat that I took, found an old frame at Goodwill and printed/framed it for her.

It's kind of large, from top to bottom the frame is ~11 inches. It was originally planned to smaller, but then I found that frame and couldn't help myself.

For bonus fun anxiety I mentioned I was excited to give her her gift and it sounded like she was taken off guard by us exchanging gifts. That's the main driving factor for this post existing.

I was asking him about COVID’s transmissibility after quarantine since I looked on the CDC website couldn’t really find straightforward info other than about quarantine itself (this all relates to he has covid and is inside for 10 days). 

I’m in public health and a lot of my work focuses not on biology but interventions in health. And I wasn’t sure how it worked  cause this isn’t my area of expertise I’ll admit I don’t know the whole biological transmissibility after quarantining. And to this he said “I should be smarter than this”. I guess to imply I’m dumb for not knowing this stuff.

There hasn’t been too many times but I feel like he does these small slights when I maybe don’t know something that I guess I’m “supposed to know”. He apologized but honestly I’ve had men be constantly mean to me and I’m worried if I continue with him he might do this. I guess previous experiences have me jaded.

I’ve been on &amp; off friends with my ex since I cut it off 2 years ago to get well. I was a toxic person. He has been the one thus far to end the friendship then come back. We’ve been trying to see where it goes but he constantly tells me he’s not ready yet. He even said if his dad doesn’t accept me, he can’t be with me. I’ve made mistakes along the way but I never stopped trying. All this year until September he played mind games, then he of course came back and apologized. Trust was also broken through things I found out. I cut it off the other day bc I feel like I give more than I get back. My birthday was saturday, he had a funeral for his old coworker through suicide that morning. My ex’s brother lost his life that way years back. He also got into a car accident which lead him to only being able to drive back n forth to work(and funeral) until it was resolved. He said he wasn’t going to make it to see me but would make it up this week. I offered to get him uber rides to me. He declined, said he will still make it up. So later that night he told me he hung out with his boy which he walked to. (they live close by). His response to mine was “he’s a 10 minute walk” I understand the passing of the coworker impacted him but how would he walk over to his friend but not come to me when I offered ubers? So, that’s what drew the line for me. There was some other things involved. I’ve waited 2 years and he’s been the only person I’ve been with since I met him meanwhile he’s had 2 girlfriends in that time. I truly love him and made a lot of efforts. It’s really hard. I feel guilt.

I said to her: “let’s go to this place to drink a beer this Wednesday night” she said okay sounds good. 

Today (Tuesday night I say hello to her she replies hi! And I tell her “just verifying if tomorrow’s thing still happening”?

And she responds “well sincerely because we don’t talk much I lost the thread of the conversation and I didn’t remember so I already made plans for tomorrow”.
