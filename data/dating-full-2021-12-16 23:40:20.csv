Sometimes it feels like G feels something for me, e.g we don't talk much on social media, but he's one of the few person who comments on my Instagram stories, we usually do play that ""Senpai - San"" thing where he's my senpai and he calls me Sheng Kun.

Any help or thoughts is greatly appreciated!!!

So a couple weeks ago I met someone off of Tinder. We hit it off immediately.  We went on two dates, were intimate on the second one, then the next time I saw them they admitted they don't want a relationship right now and although they were attracted to me, were more interested in making friends and working on figuring themselves/their life out. I accepted this because I was under the impression the dates were casual anyway and we connect really easily so I was happy they wanted to continue with friendship and even suggested fwb as an option for us because Im attracted to them a lot as well. After we talked, we went back to the car and listened to music and had really vulnerable conversations with each other. We hugged and said goodbye, but once I pulled away they lingered, almost as if they wanted to kiss me or say something. Since that night, we have hung out two more times and have plans to see each other again next week. One of the times, we went to a show they invited me to, which they bought the tickets for, and we had a really great time. After, we sat in the car and listened to music again, and while we were listening, they reached out their hand to hold mine. We just sat like that, fingers intertwined, talking and laughing and jamming to the music. When they had to get ready to go home, they leaned over and kissed me a few times, really gently. Almost as if they were savoring it. We kissed again when I got out of the car to hug them goodbye, and they told me to text them when I got home safe. 
The last time we hung out (earlier this week), I invited them to go hiking with me and surprised them with hot tea because they mentioned their favorite kind last time we were together. Again, we had an amazing time talking and laughing with one another, looking at the sun set through the trees. As is becoming the norm, once we finished we went back to my car to listen to music and chat. We had a really deep conversation and I ended up leaving them speechless because apparently I had said aloud something they had thought to themselves a lot nearly verbatim. When I asked what they were feeling, all they said was a sincere ""I'm really happy I met you"". We didn't really hold hands on this occasion, but they were facing me or our knees were touching the entire time. I even casually rested my hand on their knee for a bit and they didn't pull away. Again once we were hugging goodbye, they kissed me slowly, softly, and intentionally. Then asked me to text them when I was home. 
Although we don't avidly text back and forth, we always find little ways to talk to each/check in on one other daily. Whether that's making a plan to hang out, sending each other songs, replying to each other's Instagram stories, etc.

I guess I am just a little confused as to how they feel about me and I don't feel like I can ask without making things feel awkward since we already had a conversation about it last week. But I can't shake the feeling that they like me more than they're letting on. My biggest clue so far is that although I put the friends with benefits thing on the table, all of the touches and kisses and stuff feel caring and tender. I've never experienced that with someone that only saw me as a friend. Like theyre taking their time and that those interactions we have actually mean something to them. 
What makes it more complicated is that although I'm definitely happy to be friends and it's more than enough to just get to spend time together and have fun, I think I'm slowly growing some feelings for them and I'm scared that that could taint my view of things. That's where you guys come in.

I’m at an age where most of my friends are long term relationships, newly weds or married with children. The older I’m getting the less likely finding someone is looking for me.

I’m decent looking but extremely shy. My personality isn’t too bad either, just takes a minute for me to get comfortable. When I was younger Instagram and Twitter mutuals were the only *”sources”* of meeting guys but I’ve grown out of social media now. I think a lot has changed from 2016 social media and now.

At first I was waiting loose my virginity to someone I loved and would end up marrying but I think I’ve steer so far away from it maybe I’ll never be able to do it now. 

I don’t know any men irl and I’m extremely shy. Any time I get compliments I don’t know what to do other than smile like a giddy school girl. I’m worried that my time has past. Most people my age have experience and would see my lack of as a red flag. Like what’s wrong with me. Why hasn’t anyone ever tried to pursue me sort of thing. 

I’ve tried online dating (apps) but I’m not looking for a purely sexual relationship. Sure it’ll come along but to sign up to something with the expectation of it doesn’t really sound appealing to me. 

I have no one to talk to. I want someone to share my feelings and thoughts with. This might sound sad but I feel so lonely. I was okay when I was younger because I was surrounded but family and friends in similar life stages, now I have no one. 

Even my parents have gone off to travel the world now that my siblings have grown up too. I can’t make plans with anyone because it’s my husband this, my boyfriend that or I can’t we’re staying in with the kids tonight. The other half of my friends are pregnant.

I (35F) met a guy (38M) on tinder in July. He has a lot of baggage, but honestly the sweetest guy I've ever met. First date was fantastic, like 5 hours long, and only ended because we both had a drive and needed to get home. Then both of our lives blew up, and it took a month before date 2, but we talked most days in between. Date 2 was great too, again ended because it was getting late. 

Then our lives blew up again, him slightly more than me. Conversations became less frequent, he would go days, a week+, even the entire month of October before responding. Things seemed better through thanksgiving, with only a few days MIA (which is totally fine, we both have lives).

It's been another two weeks of silence. Which bothered me, but I justified. Until I glanced at his tinder profile to show a friend a picture, and realized it had been updated slightly. So obviously he has some level of free time on his phone.

I honestly don't think he's the type to consciously ghost, and every other time he's gone silent we would pick things up and be just as flirty as before. I don't mind playing the long game given his history, but not knowing where we stand (at least explicitly) is driving me insane.

Given the season, I've decided to give him a last ""Merry Christmas"" text next week, and if I hear nothing by new years it'll be a Dear John situation.

Tldr- I feel myself pulling away in my very loving relationship, help! 

I (20f) have been dating my boyfriend (21) for about three months now. Our relationship moved incredibly quickly. We met at a party, slept together that night, then thereafter were inseparable because we hit it off so well. Two weeks in he asked me to be his girlfriend and about a week following he said “I love you”, and I reciprocated. This little blurb is already probably setting off red flags to anyone reading but it felt so right in the moment. But now three months in it’s all catching up to me and just last week I hit a major wall in terms “how did I get here??”, and began feeling very stressed out about being so close/ having an obligation to this person. When we met I was not in a place to start a serious relationship, (but I liked him a lot, I didn’t want to turn him down and things just felt fun and light. Whereas now it’s setting in that this is a serious, emotionally invested relationship). He makes it clear to me daily how invested he is and treats me incredibly, he is so loving. Yet I still find myself with these dilemmas: 
Where I am now is: 
I just can’t make myself be intimate/ physical with him. I am very attracted to him but I feel this internal “no” That just won’t let me and leaves me feeling tense when it’s just he and I alone. And I’m torturing myself over this situation day in and day out. I feel awful that I can’t stop pulling away from him because he deserves his care to be reciprocated. 

He wants me  to meet his family over Christmas when we’re both traveling back to our shared hometown. There’s a part of me that wants to tell him I need space over the holiday to just focus on myself and my family so I can figure out what the hell is going on inside my head and my heart.

please don’t be mean. i’m not okay at all. 


he’s been emotionally abusive for months and months but i never thought he was capable of something like this. he was driving and we were having a normal argument. i was sitting behind him on his moving bike and he pushed me on the highway and i fell on top of a car. there was a loud thud, he didn’t even look back once and drove home. 
one of my leg was bleeding and the other felt..broken. i got to the side of the road and the owner of the car on top of whom i fell came and asked me if i was okay. the car owner thought that my bf ran away because he hit his car but he didn’t know that his bike didn’t hit the car, it was me. 
it felt so humiliating, cheap and small when i sat on the side of the road, crying. i felt like…i’m nothing . i’m worthless. i wish no one has to ever experience this feeling. people were looking at me cheaply..i was so scared. he car guy had other guys in his car too and he offered to take me home but since there were many guys, i refused because i felt unsafe and scared. 
i just couldn’t believe my bf did this. i could never do this to someone…especially if i claim to love them more than anything. i would never throw anyone from a moving bike and then not even look back..
i had to call him because i had no money…and i was 50 mins away from home. after an hour of begging, he returned. things only got worse from here. he started hitting me. he hit me with his bare hands, his helmet, his keys and even beat my neck with his phone. after finding out my leg was broken, he stepped on my leg and kicked it. he spat on my face…called me cheap names, abused my family, i just can’t say it all even here…i feel so humiliated and ashamed and small…i just felt like i was..nothing. i am nothing. 
he also told me to sell my body to get home. he said i deserved to get raped by those guys in the car and he told me i’m good for nothing but sex. he just said really cheap things..i cant even say them. 
he then threw me on the road again and went home…

i cant talk about this to anyone that’s why i’m sharing it here. i’m 20 years old but i still live with my parents and where i live, if my parents find out, they’ll never let me leave the house. all my freedom will be taken away. 

i also recorded all of this on audio. maybe someday, i’ll be strong enough to do something. 

i’m just so…scared. how could he do this to me? all i ever did was..love him..i could never do this to him or anyone. i feel humiliated, belittled. i don’t even feel like a human. i feel like i’m nothing. i feel so scared. i went to the doctor and my leg was broken…i keep having panic attacks. i kept having dreams all night where i was trying to just love him and he kept hitting me..i am so scared..all i wanted was for someone to hold me and make everything okay. i even begged him to hug me even after all this because i felt so scared. i just wanted someone, anyone to hold me and just make me feel safe. 

i have an important exam in 4 months. i couldn’t clear it this year because of something he did..i don’t want to get into it rn. i am just scared. if i don’t pass now, my life will be over. my parents already hate me. i feel like i can’t do this anymore…i’m just so scared and i feel worthless..


it’s 5 am. i just woke up and had a panic attack…im really scared. i talked to my best friend last night and she started crying and said that she is scared that i’ll do something to myself. i don’t know what to do…i just want to feel safe..",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1138260,public,self,i just got physically assaulted by my bf,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ri61h2/i_just_got_physically_assaulted_by_my_bf/,no_ads,0,,,,,

So as the title suggests, I have unfortunately never dated anyone and I am a 30-Year-Old virgin (Only 10 more years until I get my own movie haha), and I do not have any friendships, which you may have guessed, has been pretty difficult for me.

I wouldn’t consider myself bad looking, my job is decent and I do financially fairly well, and have a handful of hobbies and interests I’m passionate about (playing/watching basketball being my absolute biggest interest). I’ve tried to put myself out there, but I have had serious issues with rejection in both women and friendships. It has been really hard on me and I am actively in therapy trying to mitigate that sadness and working on myself.

Are there many of you out there that are or were previously in a situation as me? Maybe some of you understand the juxtaposition of knowing you want to be a happy person people actually enjoy being around to not being able to make it happen. If so, we’re you able to get some opportunities at friendship and romance? I’d love to hear how you did it and see if your approach could help me.

Entering my 30s, I’d love to finally go on a fun date, have close friends and a sex life, but if that can’t happen I’d love to mentally give that up and put my eggs in another basket - love and friends might not be for everyone but I’d like to try!

We have made out but no sex. During the 3rd date we both said that we enjoy each other company, we both feel good about our dates and would like to keep seeing each other. I ask for his opinion regarding multi-dating vs dating one person at a time, he said that he thinks it’s respectful to only date one person at a time. I said I agree with him. Together we then made plan for our 4th date a week later. We send several texts to each other every day during the week.

The morning of the day that we were supposed to have our 4th date, he texted me saying that he was not feeling well so we would have to reschedule the date next week. I asked him whether he is still interested in dating each other exclusively. Normally this guy replies to texts within 30 minutes at most, this time he took over 2 hours to reply to my text with a “yes, I do.” Later that evening, he texted me asking if I can do a phone or video call, I agreed to a video call. He was in his bed and appeared to be sick, nothing too out of the ordinary from the video call but he seems to be a bit weird (he kept asking me why I was shouting, I told him I was not it’s just my normal voice). After that video call I did not get another text from him, which is out of the ordinary as he would normally reach out to me during the day.

The following evening (almost 24 hours after the video call) I sent him a text asking if he was feeling better, no reply from him. 3 days later (yesterday) I sent him another text asking if he is still interested in seeing each other, and that I would appreciate if he could let me know either way. No reply from him so I believed he ghosted me and ready to move on. Today (over 24 hours from my last text) he just sent me a text that says “Hey I am really sorry I was dealing with something really personal. It’s no excuse.

We have good chemistry, things in common, and were both pretty well put together as adults. Seems great for a potential partner.

Thing is that we discussed our 5 year plans and mine was basically career and dream oriented (save money, advance my career, pursue making music more) hers was literally just be married and have a kid at 32. This kinda gave me great pause. I do enjoy this lady and though weve only had two dates i do feel like we have good chemistry. Part of me wants to keep seeing her. However another part of me is completely terrified of having kids. Housing, education, general life costs seem to constantly go up without wages ever increasing. On one hand i think having a family could be rewarding but on the other hand ending my family cycle of being poor while focusing on my dreams sounds amazing too. 32 seems so young to me to be a father but its actually totally the norm and more and more women will bring this up on dates around my age now.

Thoughts? Im pretty lonely sometimes and it seems like most people want kids so if i make this a dealbreaker i might just be single indefinitely. At the same time though I really cannot imagine being a dad within 5 years right now and dont know if id end up resenting starting a family.

Thoughts greatly appreciated.

I think regardless of their intentions,  when a guy sees another guy with a pretty girl , it can sometimes trigger a response in him that makes them combative ,like ""he must think he's much better than me"", similar to someone having a high position at work or having big muscles.

Now here’s how I got there: What worked for me is becoming my best self. First, I quit almost every vice I had, most importantly alcohol. I no longer got hangovers, mood swings, no black-out drunken texting etc. Next I focused on diet and exercise, had to get my brain right. Alternating days with cardio and weight lifting, while eating a diet of mostly vegetables with some fish and occasional chicken did wonders for me. After that I stopped procrastinating, I deactivated all my social networking apps, I put aside my phone for hours at a time to focus at work, I became an important asset at work which solidified my role and now I have a job for the foreseeable future. I saved up money, which I would of spent on booze, it led me to upgrading my apartment. I went from a studio shack to a sweet loft. Now that my finances and shelter were set, I learned to love spending time with myself, being alone. I got back into gaming, reading, and picked up a guitar. I believe if you’re happy alone, it takes a lot of the pressure to be with someone off. When I went on dates I didn’t care if they liked me, because I liked myself. I knew I would be fine with or without them. Every few months I tested the waters from time to time on dating apps, went on a few dates, but I never felt a connection. I stayed patient, continued everything above, and then one random day a year later, I matched with her. She’s perfect. She’s quickly becoming my best friend, I love our stupid inside jokes, I love that she also loves gaming, reading, and all the stupid shows I love. I knew it the moment I met her. It was like coming home, only to no home I’ve ever known. Thanks for reading, I’m hoping this helps someone thinking about becoming their best self.

I then gave her my number and told her we should chat and I'm sure we'd be laughing the whole time, but she just kind of ignored it and talked about something else.

I don't know, I am just secretly blushing since the day he did the little things for me in my moody days.

We are in an LDR and hence, usually when I hit my periods, he is far away from me. But this time, we were together when I was in my days.

I never had a boyfriend who bought sanitary pads for me(I always felt awkward about it). But, with him, I just casually told him on the way back from my work to get a packet of sanitary pads for me. He exactly knows how moody I get though, and as I walked in the room, I find my sanitary pads and a bouquet of flowers and some chocolates laid on the bed.

He welcomed me with the biggest smile and the brightest eyes. Massaged my shoulders and ran a bath for me. I never felt so pampered like this ever before. Took me out to my favorite restaurant and even entertained me for the night with his silly little happy dance and singing his heart out.

He never sang in front of me, nor danced, but, that night, he didn't care. He knew I would never judge him. And that too, made me feel that, even when I am bleeding and in pain, he wouldn't judge me too. He made me feel so comfortable and special.

He is a very sweet guy and he always takes care of every little thing of mine. But, this time, he won it. I looked at him while he was happily singing and dancing, and said to myself, ""Yes, this is the guy I wanna spend the rest of my life with.""

Went on a date with a girl last Sat. justa lunch date, a get-to-know you type thing. I thought it went well. But I have fucked this up before and showed all my cards within about 15 minutes. Well, things have changed a little bit. I know now that isn't the way to play the game. So after the date I labeled her name as ""Don't Do It"" in my phone.

Got to know her over the course of the school year, ended up working on the same political campaign as her by the start of the Fall 2019 semester, saw each other more or less every weekend.

Asked her out in Sep. 2019 since I saw her on Tinder. Got a ""not interested"" back, life went on.

Campaign lasted until March 2020 (the election night watchparty was the last big event I was at pre-COVID), stayed in touch with her by text intermittently over the course of the rest of 2020/early 2021.

Candidate we both worked for filed for a 2022 rematch back in the spring, so since this past June we've once again been spending most of our weekends together working on campaign stuff. 

And while this is probably partially caused by the fact that I've hit yet another cyclical rough spot in OLD (couple of successful dates each with two matches followed by ""I've found someone else and want to see how it goes with him"" texts)...I kind of want to try again with her? Not until after the campaign ends in March/May since I don't want to once again shit where I eat, but definitely after that ends.

Of course, all my friends that I've asked have told me to not push this further - that she knows my intentions and would make a move if she's interested - and I don't want to revert back to the pushy creep that I was back in high school.

I was in a really toxic 3year relationship. I broke up with my ex almost 2 years ago. Since then, i decided to be a fuckboy. I have been with 25 girls in dates, honestly just trying to have sex. 

Two months ago, at an arcade place I go often to pick up chicks, I approached this girl. She was pretty to my eyes, took my breath away. She seemed really interested. I asked for her snapchat, and then later left the place. 

She reached out to me first, we talked for 4 days and then went on our first date. The date was the most incredible date ive been in all of my life. No kidding, amusement park, beach, alcohol, the fucking best. We kissed and had sex that same night. The problem here is that she told me she was married, but that her husband and her were sleeping on a different room, that they were no longer together. That the love was over, and that she stayed because of their kid and because he is going to help her become a US resident.

After that, the next night, I brought her to my house and she spent the night, then the next day we chilled all day in my room, she spent the night again and then I dropped her off. No calls from her husband at all. 

We have been doing this weekly, and I really feel like she is so special. Like Ive said, ive been a fuck boy. I have slept with 15 girls this past year, even slept over. But I havent had this romantic feeling towards them, the time together is wonderful. I never want her to leave, Im never bored of her and the thing here is, that she feels the same about me.

I know its fast, but I have some really deep feelings for her already, and she tells me she does too. She has a lot of great things. She is not looking for money, Ive been unemployed since I met her, and she has paid for a lot of my shit without asking anything in return. Her sex is amazing, she is a fucking nympho and pleases me in every sexual way. She is romantic, we talk all day everyday. Our chemistry is through the roofs, honestly, since my ex, i haven't felt anything like this. I just feel like I can't lose her, like maybe, even if I sound crazy as fuck... Maybe she is the love of my life...

She left her husband's house a month ago. She went back to her mom's. Weve been seeing each other at least 2-3 times a week. Almost always ending on a sleepover. She brought up the ""exclusivity talk"" because she probably sensed that I was a ho, and I asked her to be my girl

A week ago, she asked me If I could help her move her stuff from her old apartment. The now ""ex"" wasn't there. That day I asked her, because I had my suspicions, that if she and her ex were really sleeping in different rooms like she told me 2 to 3 times when we werent official... She said that they were sleeping together.

That shit broke my heart to be honest. Since then I feel less trust for her. Now I'm not going to act like a Saint, when we weren't official I had 5 sex partners including her. But I have dropped them for her now. And I lied to her about that too when she asked me. She said that she lied to me because she did not want to lose me, I did the same.

That shit has been drilling my fucking mind, I dont wanna fuck shit up, because as crazy as it sounds, she is my baby and i feel a lot for her, but it just hurts me to think that the ""relationship"" wasn't over over. That she lied to me. Now I know its unfair, because is not like I wasn't fucking nobody since i met her. In fact, after I dropped her off when she first came to sleep in my house, I went to a party and met this girl, which I had sex with the same night and we had sex after that many times. 

Is this something bad? I don't think Ill leave her to be honest, I wanna squeeze every single moment I have with her because she is so special.

I'm about a month or two from getting back on my feet. I don't have my check truck anymore either so I walk an hour to and from work everyday so it's not like I can go out looking for a descent woman on my Chevrolegs 6 miles away.

Everything was going amazingly, and that was the only deal breaker, which does not make any sense at all. We met here on Reddit a month ago and it was going so well. We seemed to click, have a lot in common, and could easily talk to each other; we used to tell eachother that we liked each other a lot, how glad we were to have met one another, and how we wanted to be in eachother's life for a while. That obviously didn't last long. Lol.

I didn't like that we just had to be friends over that one insignificant thing and I ended up pulling away, even though we enjoyed talking to eachother and hanging out (online). I made new posts to meet people, and he followed suit and did the same. I asked him about something he said to me during that day and he told me that he didn't say what he did, even though he did. I asked something else, and he stopped responding as quickly as he usually did. I saw that he unfriended me on and was separating from me, even though I began to do it first. I got upset and sent him a goodbye message, and we definitely can't make up and be friends even after what I said.

Main part: He was a cool guy, and seemed decent for the most part, and was Christian, so I was told. I feel like my chances of meeting a decent partner would be higher if he's Christian. I'm spiritual myself and want a partner who is at least spiritual or believes in something. H also didn't care about my religion and just wanted to be with me, and I'm hoping to find someone who feels the same way, or is like him, to be honest.

I (M17) was an entertainer at a summer camp for kids, as many other teenagers. There was this girl (15) who I was getting along pretty well, and since i liked her, I thought to try actually flirt for the first time. Two weeks later, after a little success (but not really) we go with the kids to an aquapark. There she flirts back, and we spend a wonderful day together (while keeping an eye on the kids so they didn't drown themselves, and protecting a child from a group of perverts, ugh). On the way back, on the bus (so other people were around) we cuddle together as expected. Then, she guides my hand on her boobs, and I didn't know what to do, so after a while I just move it back and start petting her again. Then, she does the same thing. Now, I was down for a little playing, but not in a bus full of people (and kids). After that we texted a bit since I was in other location for the same job, and she was coming the after. I did a bit of flirting but she wasn't responding. Until the day she came, she told me that ""sadly for you, I have my period now""... And then proceeded to fall for an older (and more handsome) guy, which I was cool with since she was acting so strangely.

(maybe from my peers/generation/the whole world...)

So I (20 sth. M) am an oversea scientific researcher in Aus, and two months or so after my journey started here COVID came, and then lockdown and lockdown again, which might literally ruin everything. So really not much chance to get into real friendship, relationship etc. even though I really hoped to and tried... 

I won't say I am a handsome guy like David Beckham, but at least would say it's a ""decent"" outlook I suppose ? also enjoy a wide range of hobbies from outside (sports) to inside (art). 

From others' point of view, I am bloody reliable and considerate and organized (acknowledged by whoever works with me, even just briefly interact with me for this and that...) and maybe a bit romantic or at least artistic (as one of my friends told me another one considered me like that lol). Plus, most people I am acquintance with would feel more than safe when I have their back, which I understand might be a great compliment as friends .... (but not sure, and please see below...

As for myself, I sometime would doubt whether I might be too good to be friend or too good to date lol, like a text I received before Xmas is like, ""could not ask for a better lab mate/collaborator, sth. like that...""; yeh so not sure maybe I am more suitable to work with instead of hanging out together, who knows... On the other hand, I also find myself difficult to adapt to my peers or generations, like I don't drink, I can hardly hold a casual conversation or chit chat (maybe bc I work with science and am more solution-orientated lol), I never play PC game, don't watch Netflix or whatever series etc. etc.; I usually could hold the talk better when it comes to my research or my hobbies, which are unfortunately quite specific and though might be interested but won't really last in a dating or hanging out scenario.  

So after spending my birthday alone again recently, and likely alone as well for the coming Xmas and new year, I really hope something could change in the new year, even though I also understand I might just be who I am LOL...

I go over, and she immediately jumps my bones. I take care of her, and she starts taking care of me. She stops and wants me to fuck her. I say I'm not ready yet. She gives me a handjob. She stops halfway through and saying nothing, rolls over and goes to sleep.

Ok, now I'm a bit frustrated, but I'm a big boy, I promised her a fuck I didn't deliver, and I am big on active and ongoing consent, so I just hold her.

30 minutes later, she starts falling asleep, so I hug her goodnight and whisper goodnight in her ear. She says it back.

I start pulling me arm away and get up to leave, and she FLIPS out on me. She says ""WHERE ARE YOU GOING!?""

I told her that I have an early morning and don't want to hit traffic.

""FINE. JUST LEAVE!?""

I then say we should slow down and offer to lay back down and hold her.

She then starts SCREAMING at me to get the fuck out over and over again.

My boyfriend was being sly,  purchasing porn - but that's not the point of this post -He's subbed to some effing site  and can't remember which one but it's charging him 64$ish a month. 

The charge comes up under ""mlnce.""com 

Apparently he needs to unsub from the site directly to stop the transactions. 

Can anyone  shed light on which website charges under this name ? 

I've found out it's registered to Izeo Dating.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1138390,public,self,Dating Site Subscribers HELP,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ridydh/dating_site_subscribers_help/,no_ads,0,,,,,

Last weekend I ended up going to her house and we had sex. Days later I didn’t hit her up after that night and so did she. I thought I had made the mistake of not reaching back out and that she felt some type of way about it. So I called her and we talked for about 20 minutes of how our week has been and she didn’t ask why I did not reach out, so I ended asking if she felt some type of way about it , and she replied NO and I simply said ok good and switched the topic. She was doing things through the days before the call to try and make me jealous and “chase her”. So after the call she gave me the closure that she was running her manipulative mind games on me and now Im putting her on ICE. I stopped reaching out and flaked on group setting hangouts and put the stories on mute. Now I can tell she wants my attention even more by sending more snaps, posting more stories than usual, &amp; and trying to get my attention. I wanted to have some self respect for myself and now my worth.
