I'm only a young male and I am not interested in casual meetups. I respect myself and other people too much for that. I understand people want that sometimes however, I don't think its right they use the apps for this. I believe that dating apps should be used for their main purpose, dating. It'd be so much easier for people to find dates and create relationships if the apps cut down the amount of people using the apps for ulterior motives.   
I don't like to mess women around as I don't think its fair on them. It literally just wastes their time when they could be pursuing something serious with someone who makes them happy.

He is from a small rural town and a very simple, down-to-earth person, a quality that I adore about him. 

I can see that he is also quite frugal and responsible financially, which is a great thing and makes perfect sense given that he is still a student. (He is finishing his master's degree and works part-time.) 

I never thought this could be an issue until recently. So, although we are the same age, I started working way earlier than him, and my salary is quite decent. And sometimes, I want us to try nice things and go to nice places, not always, but time to time. 

(And by this I don't mean fine-dining and going on luxurious vacations -- just traveling time to time, going to good restaurants, drinking decent wine, decompressing in the spa, etc.) He seems to be happy with a student-like life style, and I am also happy to spend time with him regardless of what we end up doing, but I just wish we could do nice things together sometimes. 

Given that I am making more money than him and I am quite comfortable financially, I really wouldn't mind covering for him. But at the same time, I know he won't be comfortable with this. 

For example, he had a really hectic week at work and I really want to treat him to a massage at a nice hotel spa this weekend. But I'm not sure how he will feel about this... One of my friends who lives abroad invited us to visit her this summer and he's mentioned that he wanted to visit the country before. But how do I bring this up? The ticket is quite pricey (especially thinking back how poor I was as a student) and I don't want to make him feel pressured or anything...I wouldn't mind paying for his ticket but how would this make him feel? I'm not sure. 

Am I too selfish for feeling this way? Am I a condescending jerk?

Tinder: The most famous of them all. Everyone knows tinder. Originally started off as a hookup app, and was then taken over by relationship enthusiasts. Now almost entirely bot accounts. Most common thing you'll find is ""Add my snapchat so I can tell you about my onlyfans.""

OKCupid: Another relatively large one. Surprising mix of religious fanatics and ""Can my husband watch?"" types.

Clover: Fantastic place to research pricing for sexworkers in your area. I dont have anything against sexworkers, and I absolutely think they deserve respect, but this app has a disproportionate amount of people who will share their rates with you immediately.

Plenty Of Fish: ""I want to get married immediately but I can't afford match.com""

Match: ""I will literally murder a human baby in order to get married tomorrow.""

Fetlife: Same as match, just substitute getting married for getting tied up.

CoffeeMeetsBagel: Scream endlessly into the void, never receiving a response, that you want to date someone. Anyone. Please.

KinkD: Same as Coffee Meets Bagel, but replace date someone with being whipped by someone.

Events And Adventures: Pay $900 to go on vacation with 13 dudes and one single female.

Hinge: You've been geograpgicslly near this person at some point. Try to form a relationship based off that I guess.

hope y'all are doing well &amp; staying safe!

both of us are 21 y/o, just that i am a couple months than him (5 months)

**BACK STORY** : so during 2016, there was a get together (college pals reunion kind of thing) at my dad's friends place which consisted of 5 families. there were around 10-12 kids present there and i had a huge crush on one of the guys (let's call him J) who was the quietest in the whole bunch. whenever i tried initating convos with him, he would walk away so i thought that maybe he wasn't comfortable talking to me or just not interested. fast forward to 2018, we kept touch over social media but that didn't last for long either cause sooner or later he wasn't that active on it as he used to be, due to excessive college work and all that stuff.

**CURRENT SITUATION:** yesterday at work, i had seen J in the cabin opposite to mine and it turns out that he's working as an intern just like me. J told me that he knew i was working here. the very day before, i was actually late to work and he was seated on the waiting couch in the HR dept. J heard the HR manager call out my name and once i left from there, he checked the attendance sheet. that's how he knew it was me and wanted to say hi but couldn't since i was in a rush. tbh i didn't really expect that he would remember who i was.

so when i went to his cabin, i was still doubtful as to whether it was J or not. i said hi and he stood up and i was shook when he recognized me instantly cause like i said earlier i hadn't seen him in the HR dept. we interacted quite a lot and caught up with each others current life situations. surprisingly it looks like we have quite a lot in common, and the only difference is that he is a big time extrovert while I'm an introvert. J was actually stunned when i told him about the party that was back in 2016, to which he told me that he remembers that day as well, since it was an awesome day after all and will definitely be treasured forever. i felt so comfortable talking to him and it was the same from his end as well.

*now here's the real deal:* at times i keep having this feeling of whether to pursue him or not cause of many reasons. J might have a gf already or maybe he was being open because he is an extrovert like i said earlier or maybe because i am family friend to him.

When I asked my friends for advice they told me to get to know him more and speak to him during our off work hours and know his secrets and stuff like that. I told them I'm gonna take it slow &amp; it's meant to happen it will. they also stated that the way things are proceeding is still a good start. 

we haven't exchanged numbers nor do we follow each other from social media and from my end, i'm really scared to send him a request or ask him for his number because that would come off as clingy apparently.

im not jumping to conclusions here, just putting my thoughts out is all.

i dont mind having him as a friend either because he is just an awesome guy, but i'm just kinda confused about the whole situation.

I spent a lot of time with them in school and while I'd admit she was attractive, I thought of her more as a little sister.

So I'm heading back to college and went to advising to figure out the best path forward. The person at the front desk was a cute girl and we kinda hit it off. We kept talking to the point where someone would come in, and she'd quickly check them in while I pretended to fill out more of a form that I'd finished way earlier. She'd then pick the conversation back up or bring up another topic. I'm bad with picking up signals and wasn't sure if she was being friendly so we talked for a bit longer and she asked for my name as I left and I replied and asked the same. I've gotta head back this coming week so I'm guessing I might see her again.

If it still seems like she's interested can I ask her to get a drink or give her my number? I was in a very long relationship and it was the only one I've been in and haven't really tried since(2 years) so I'm pretty bad with this sort of thing...

I am not the most handsome, tall and/or muscular man out there, but I have many things to offer. Yet, when I'm there, I just feel like a hunk of flesh presenting myself in front of masses of potential pickers, trying to present my best angle, in the best lighting, say the right words, yet every time there is no match, it's like I am rejected by all of womankind. Is it the way I look? the words in my bio? Should I leave things out? am I not worth it when I simply state what I'm about? (My bio states my hobby's, and is just a very simple introduction, nothing special)

Every time I seem to be doing the picking myself, even when I say yes to all, there is no response. Just the empty page with no matches. When it happens, I am expected to do all the heavy lifting, carry the conversation, be someone else. There is no conversation, just the meat grinder killing me inside while every instance I succeed leads to more nonsense, more meaningless, short conversations. No dates, no good conversations, just a second phase of the selecting process where it does not feel like meeting someone, but like a job interview, even though I'm trying to be amicable, inquiring into who a person is, how they are, and just trying to have a good conversation to figure it who I am dealing with, so that I might make plans to meet them in the near future, which is why I use the app, I do not get that. 

In most cases, I am the one carrying the conversation where it seems like the other side is not interested. I try telling funny stories, tell them about something very interesting (my family runs a company that breeds kittens, deals with many dogs and cats, many nice photos and all), ask them how they are, what they have been up to, and all of that. But there is no enthusiastic response, no matter what I say. I let them talk about whatever they want, participate, but there is no talking from their side, just short, conversation-killing messages, even though they swiped right and entered the conversation willingly.

Before the lockdown, I had places in real life where I could meet women, but now I just have the internet, so I returned to Tinder, and the same things are happening again, even though I've matured and am more attractive after losing weight, growing a nice beard, matured in the face and all of that.

(M 25 6’1” Scorpio(Idk if this applies) Financially secured. Been told I’m very handsome/good looking. Know how to cook/bake gourmet food) I got out of a serious LTR of 3 years about a year and half ago. Waited a year to put myself out there again. 

But I keep running into the same problem. Tried dating apps but it always ends the same way. Don’t want to go on a second date and always say Tell me I’m nice but “they’re aren’t ready to open themselves up. Or just got out of a relationship.” 

Went on a date with this girl and everything was going great. We were clicking well and had more things in common than I was expecting. Went on a second date. I drove us to a sunset beach and packed a cooler with drinks, snacks, and homemade desserts. Went really well and she invited me back to her place and we also picked up some Thai food. 

We were on her couch and started making out but she said she “didn’t want to hook up.” I responded immediately with “no problem,” and tapered back. She started beaming with a bright smile and taken aback said ”I was the nicest guy she’s ever met and whoever raised me. Raised me right.”

We hung out more watching a movie, snuggled, and made out more. Had a really nice intimate kiss goodbye and I left. 

Don’t hear anything for two days then receive this

“You’re literally one of the nicest guys I’ve ever met and I had a good time but it’s a classic story of I got my heart broken by my ex and I’m not ready to open myself up to something new. I’m sorry I wasted your time!”

I’d be lying if I said this didn’t hurt. First girl I’ve felt comfortable with to even consider opening myself up to. Everything goes great and still managed to get burned. I feel completely closed off and want to give up but yearn for a human connection. 

I’m completely lost. Is this normal? I’ve never really been in the dating game and I want to meet someone but I always end up burned.

We have only been out on two dates. The first we spent almost 5 hours together talking. A couple days later he planned a second date for the following weekend. He ended up cancelling the morning of and apologized saying that something came up at work. I figured this was his way of dodging me but then he asked to reschedule a few days later.

So we ending up going on a walk. This date was VERY short. There was a chance of rain that day and he had told me if it rained we could just go for a drive instead. However, about 15 minutes into our walk it started to rain and instead of going for a drive he just drove me home! When he dropped me off he apologized for a poorly planned day and told me I could plan the next date. 

Since that date he has reached out less than before but when he does he is still flirty. I decided that maybe I was overthinking so I reached out a few days ago to plan a third date. I asked him when he was free and he told me that he worked on the weekend but should be free during the week. The conversation kind of ended there without any set plans. BUT THEN he snapchats me during the weekend (at a time he said he would be working) and hes not at work???

Over the past few days there has been very little conversation between us. But then out of nowhere he sends me a message saying something like ""I'm really sorry I promise I haven't been trying to avoid you I've just had a really hard week"" but then doesn't mention when he'll be free next...

I tend to hit on the guy, give him that cute smile or say hi. Yes, I as the female approaches the male... I'll ask for his number or compliment him. Get to know him and ask what he likes and see if we seem compatible. I also tend to be the one who asks him on a date and offers to pay for it because I do not like when men think women just want a free meal. I am really here to try to make a lasting connection and figure out if this could work. Although, I am not saying after one date, I think we are made to last either. lol. I just find there is this tendency where I put this time and effort into this person and getting to know them for a couple of months, and then something just changes and the guy is over it/me and disconnects and disappears.   


I get sometimes men aren't interested, like they learn you're not what you're looking for and leave. I just feel it happens so abruptly with my relationships and I am blindsided. One thing I think it might be is when a relationship is starting to be more serious, I find the men I date don't seem to be able to handle that. They usually are immature emotionally. I am the type of person who I feel is very responsible and acts a bit older/mature for my age. 

I have become a bit discouraged to try to meet people though. I do not really get approached or hit on either when I am out. Stuff like a guy walking up to you in a bar or at a grocery store seems like just the movies... Or maybe I'm just ugly lmfao. 

Knowing all of this though... I was just wondering, how do I meet men and start that romantic relationship? I do not think what I am doing is working... 

Also, I work a lot. So I will admit, I do not get out a lot to meet people and there are virtually no dudes where I work unless they're fathers (because I work in pediatrics). I do not want a family as well. I see myself one day getting married, no kids, and spending my days with a significant other vacationing all over the world. I find most nice guys are usually guys who wanna settle down one day and have a family and I just don't really feel I can ever give that without being a phony. I am not super picky on looks, but I do tend to lean towards leaner or even super skinny guys. I also am not interested in guys who smoke or get high a lot. I personally do not drink but I don't mind if they do. I don't care if he has tattoos either, but I am not a fan if he has tattoos like all over his head and face and neck.

This person and I were pretty good friends and worked on a few creative projects together. We’d get drinks and dinner, but it was always platonic.

I’m a few years older than them so they’d say stuff like how they look up to me and even drunkenly asked me to mentor them.

*I should clarify, I’m only 4 years older, this isn’t like a creepy thing lol*

After we went out one night, it was getting late and we were pretty drunk, so they invited me to stay over until I felt better to get home.

Of course, being drunk 20-somethings we started to fool around (we did a bunch of stuff but they said they weren’t ready to have sex, which I fully respected).

It was actually sort of a weirdly intimate experience for both of us and after a few hours I felt sober enough to go. 

We did the whole “I’m so surprised, I wasn’t expecting this to happen” thing and then I left. 

This was about a month ago. We haven’t spoken since really. It was very much a one and done thing — in fact, the whole night they was telling me about a person rent really liked and was starting to date. 

But today, out of nowhere, I realized they blocked me on all socials. I’m sort of surprised; we were pretty good friends and never argued or anything. 

We also have a lot of mutual friends.

Fast foward to around April 2021 she said she would like to have a girlfriend too because she is bi and asked me my opinion.   I said yes because I understood her position plus I really dont see anything bad about it. If it was a man then yes I would not like it but I dont mind women ( as long as she is clean and not a crazy person obviously).  


Now the problem to the problem. She is beginning a new relationship type of thing with this new girl, who from what I know seems like a good person but thats not the issue haha. The other girl is not the problem she seems fine and my gf looks very happy.  The issue is that I AM NOT allowed whatsoever to touch another human being. Reasons she gave me?   
1. I am not bi so I would only touch women and she doesnt want me to touch another woman ever.  
2. She is the very jealous type so she says here mind would not allow her to share even if its just sex.  


I repeat I dont have a problem with her dating a woman. My problem is that I consider this very unfair that I cannot do anything with another person.

I’m planning to do the following to get out there more, but if anyone has any other tips, let me know! 
- participate in more social event doing things I like (i’ve already joined a running group, but im also planning to take up power lifting, and join a local board game meetup) 
- go to bars with my single friend with the goal to start chatting with guys (something ive never done before) 
- go to speed dating events or other singles meet ups 
- let friends, family, coworkers know I’m looking for a serious relationship, in hopes they might know someone willing to go on a date with me!  

A little background as well, I dont think I’m all that attractive (mostly due to being overweight) but I’ve been working super hard over the past year and lost 50lbs and have developed healthy habits, but i know still being overweight puts me at a disadvantage.

I met this guy through a dating app and we have been texting to each other for nearly 4 months now. He seems to be very down to earth and super friendly. We’re pretty chilled and laid back as well. Our conversations are mostly about casual things like work, study, hobbies, etc… and we don’t really flirt. Although we text everyday, we don’t text constantly from day till night, instead we would reply to each other’s texts once every 6-7hrs. Sometimes, it can be longer than 7hrs or even a day, but he always replied to my messages and never left me on seen. Plus, he’s also the one carries the conversation when we run out of things to say. Last week, he invited me to his discord server as i told him i was bored during lockdown. He said i can join them anytime if i want to. I’m more like an introvert and shy person, and i only know him, so i just stay there in the server. I only use discord for uni stuff and the spamming bothers me, so i muted all the servers i’m in, including his server. A few days later, he messaged me to not to reply to his friends. They were asking who am i, and they were questioning him as well, since he was the one inviting me. He told me his friends were tryna find my socials and he told them nothing so he needed to unfriend me for awhile, and he would add me back later. I was surprised for a bit, like why didn’t he tell them i’m just his friend? From what i know, he also has some female close friends and all of them are his besties. His friends were teasing him coz he doesn’t date  any of these girls but staying single and being these girls’ besties. He also invited me to play games with him and he said he’s gonna train me to be a pro lol. I thought he would forget to add me back on socials but i was wrong, he definitely added me the day after.

one thing that has been getting under my skin as of lately is that this man is repeatedly suggestions shows to me that i have absolutely no interest in. i have made it clear that i don’t have an interest in anime, it’s something that i’ve never been able to get into and i don’t see myself getting into (i’ve tried four as a result of my last boyfriend consistently harassing me to give it another shot and giving me the cold shoulder when i didn’t want to, this became a real point of contention in the relationship, believe it or not). i myself have made recommendations to him for shows that i very much enjoyed, all of which couldn’t be further away from anime/supernatural/superhero marvel/dc content. he’s enjoyed my recommendations thus far. 

i will repeat again that i’ve made it clear what sorts of shows/media i enjoy: non-animated, non-superhero or supernatural, psychological thrillers, horror, true crime documentaries or shows depicting true stories/cases, drama or coming of age content. but again, last night, he asked me if i’ve seen loki as he is going to start watching it, then when i again explained what i just said at the beginning of this paragraph, he asked me if i’ve seen some film about superheroes and suggested that i watch it since it’s “dark” or “has dark elements”. 

i am beyond annoyed and at that point, i just stopped responding. i don’t know how to make it any more clear that i don’t want these recommendations and that i have no interest in this sort of content. what would you do? 

additional info: another possible series of red flags that i am seeing:
he’s continuing to ask me for selfies, tries to butter me up with excessive compliments in basically every message, and at one point yesterday when i mentioned that i am about to go swimming, he said something along the lines of “i’m imagining you in bikini and it’s giving me questionable thoughts 🥵”, when the conversation was nowhere near flirty at that point. 

he hasn’t once referred to me by my name, it’s always “good morning gorgeous/ beautiful” or some other generic term of endearment that makes me feel as if he’s just running through a roster of girls. 

at one point when we had established a weekend to meet, he asked me if he can leave his car at my crib since he doesn’t feel comfortable driving in unfamiliar cities, which okay fair enough because same, but at the same time i don’t feel comfortable with someone knowing where i live on the first date. 

i don’t feel as if i am being respected and i just feel as if something about this whole interaction is sus. what do you all think.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,901779,public,self,dude (27) keeps recommending me (24f) shows/media that i’m not interested in.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/olo45s/dude_27_keeps_recommending_me_24f_showsmedia_that/,all_ads,6,,,
