Right now I’m trying to decide this...

Matched with a guy and chatted for a few days in the app. He seemed great, attractive, smart good sense of humor. He asked if I’m comfortable moving to text after about a week, and we did. (I now know not to do this before meeting, I’m learning). 

The past week we’ve been texting back n forth almost daily. Overall good banter but here’s the thing, several times now, out of the blue, he’ll call me “babe”. Wtf? It’s like totally out of context. We’ll be having a normal chat about normal things, then boom (“good night dream of me, babe + kiss emoji ”). This grosses me out and I don’t even like a dude I’m in a relationship to call me babe. Plus he sent me a couple (very normal) selfies out of the blue that I didn’t ask for.  It’s not my style. 

So question: we’ve planned a first date for a couple days from today. I don’t know if I should give it a chance or not. Aside from the babe/selfies shit, I would probably be excited. But right now I want to bail. But then I think, should I give it a chance in person? Or is this enough of a red flag to run?  Also if I cancel what should I say? This is all new to me.

Need some advice, good, bad, ugly I want to hear it.

A bit about me:

I’m 41, divorced, 3 kids. I own a successful business, hit the gym daily, have a good social life, interesting hobbies, and have had an abundance of potential women offer to do life with me. 

I have dated every age group and walk of life, and previously had ruled out single moms due to the lack of time they have for a relationship and also due to my lifestyle. 

I generally am pretty carefree when my kids aren’t here. I like to boat, have cocktails, have lots of sex, have friends over, travel. Basically a very traditional single lifestyle. 

Here’s the thing. I met someone that I am seriously into, and she has two small kids. 

She clicks all of the boxes for me personally, and I would love to spend my life with someone like her. 

Lately I’ve been feeling like this single lifestyle is getting old, I’m getting old, there has to be more substance to my life. 

Has anyone here successfully been with a single mom long term? Am I crazy for considering this? 

I am currently dating a 24 year old ex model and feeling like what the heck am I doing. Should I just settle down and join this amazing woman?

For context she’s 34, which also I’m a little worried about. Why? I have no idea I’m just used to the late 20s girls at the gym I guess.

(Great timing, I know). The majority of women I have “met” online, or dated, are either:
- Very flaky
- Have an agenda (money)
- Very likely to lose interest and ghost (which is a rude way to handle things)

It seems to me that women have access to so many men online that they don’t seem to think they have to try anymore, they don’t need to be respectful, or they think they can scam men for money.

The number of times where...

I’ve been stood-up... (really? In the age of mobile phones and messaging apps? How rude)...

Or I’ve struck-up a great conversation only for her to tell me that she’s dropped her phone and cannot afford to get it fixed (hint, hint)...

Or they’ve just taken advantage... One time, my date chose her favourite (expensive) restaurant, happily talked non-stop throughout the date, then suggested we stick around for cocktails. She then told me she was going to smoke a quick cigarette outside, and didn’t come back... leaving me with a rather hefty bill to pay. Of course, by the time I had realised she wasn’t coming back, she had blocked me on social media.

I guess “a girl’s gotta eat” (as Phoebe Buffay said in Friends)...

I detailed my most recent date (a week ago) in another post, so I won’t repeat all that. But, it seemed to go really well, and then I got blocked and ghosted. Now, I understand some people are dealing with the trauma of previous relationships, but treat people with some respect! Otherwise, why go on the date?

Are there any women out there who realise men are human beings, and deserve a bit more respect? Or do you have similar experiences dating men?

Is there any respect for other beings anymore? Or is humanity itself just heading for the sewer?

He’d Facebook friend requested me earlier which I accepted and immediately felt weird about. 
Then at eleven pm he posts on my Facebook page about how great our date was with a heart.
To me that feels so yuck. Like he’s marking his territory for other men to know. I immediately deleted the post and blocked him on every place we could connect.

I thought of divorce since almost the beginning off and on, but felt trapped because I have 2 kids, now 16 and 10 — I have full custody (ex is out of state). I have recently been diagnosed with ADHD and have realized that some of the struggles with that definitely affected my relationship and social life in general. I didn’t have very much dating / sex life experience before I got married at age 22, and what experience I did have was kind of sad. I didn’t know how to communicate well and had this idea that romantic relationships were totally different than friendships so would act not really like myself. 

I have done a LOT of work on myself since then, have grown and matured of course, am a respected professional in my field, do service work in my community, am a great mom, a fun person, finishing my PhD, am decently attractive (but have to work on my fitness), in therapy, saving money, independent and self-reliant, honest and caring, have come to new understandings about relationships....

I’ve been lurking on this sub and have a ton of questions. How do you know you’re ready to date after divorce? I’m terrified of OLD but don’t see a lot of other options as long as Covid continues ... how do you find people to date IRL once it’s not a pandemic (I won’t meet them in my line of work)? Should you wait to date until you have a solid idea of whether you’re looking for a LTR or just fun dates or FWB or whatever (because I don’t know yet)? Will people be scared off by my past once I tell them about it? Will men be terrible to me because I’m not thin or particularly in shape (but working on it)?

First of all a disclaimer:

&amp;#x200B;

**Disclaimer:**

I don't think that life as such is unfair just because I am am man

I don't hate women, I've had my share of sexual partners and I had my 12 years long marriage that led to two wonderful kids that I love more than anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Secondly - Please ladies .. Stay out of this thread.** 

This isn't about you. I'm interested in what my fellow men are thinking. And sure, there are going to be a few that come here to brag and tell me that they've just re-married (maybe even a 25 year old) and there are going to be a few that will go all anti-women ... But hopefully we are going to get a discussion that can benefit us all :)

&amp;#x200B;

**The actual post:**

I just find that I sit here in silence facing zero interest and I've basically given up on ever having a relationship again. 

I mean, I'm fairly extrovert and intense when the mood strikes me, so since my divorce 5 year ago I've managed to get laid whenever I was feeling too ""desperate"", but apart from that .. Everything seems bland. 

The thing is after that first shag then sure, I can get laid again .. but I still have to do the heavy lifting. Initiate, be awesome, entertain and then ok .. we do a repeat .. but next time you again have to initiate and .. fuck it! 

&amp;#x200B;

**Kids**

I didn't realize this back in the day, but with 20/20 hindsight it is blatantly obvious that having kids was the main driver .. Sex and fertility in other words. Especially in my younger years I accepted a lot of shit just for the sake of good/fun sex. 

&amp;#x200B;

That thing is gone ... So what I'm left with is still very little interest .. and it is still having to do a shit load of heavy lifting. I mean .. I can do that .. and I can get a woman going if need be, but I no longer can do that continuously like in the old day. The reward is simply not there. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Simply put**

I want interest, I want engagement and I want support. 

Sex alone is no longer can no longer carry it .. I suspect it's the lack of fertility that comes with being our age

But that seems to be too much to ask, so there ... oh well .. *shrugs shoulders*

&amp;#x200B;

**My questions**

So here are my two questions:

1. I'm not the only one that feels this way am I. That life no longer is about relationships. It's about my kids, it's about me, it's about work .. But the dating stuff seems to no longer carry a reward, right?

I went back to school when we were pregnant with our second and into a time-intensive job. We both knew that to be case. While I was doing that and starting my career she started hanging out a lot with a stay-at-home dad friend that we had just met. They both had more time to do fun stuff and work out a lot than his wife or I did and I guess found out they had a lot in common and just recently bought a house together - mostly with money he extorted out of his ex in lieu (per his untrustworthy word) of child support that she would have to pay him for the next 15 years.

She never talked to me about anything we could do so salvage our marriage and keep our family in tact. After we were separated for 18 months and divorced she said in an email after I mentioned the word affair (which she still insanely doesn’t think happened) she said some mean things and that I didn’t make her feel wanted as a woman. That was painful because I did want her as a woman but in retrospect my being so busy trying to learn a hard new thing made me emotionally and psychologically and physically exhausted and I guess allowed me to not place our relationship on the forefront in her mind. It was on the forefront, I felt like the things I was doing was for us and for her. She appreciated it and told me until she stopped and didn’t tell me. I didn’t want her to feel that way. She was the most important person in my life. My hopes and dreams and what I strived for were mostly related to my family and she was the most integral part. 

I don’t have hopes for her and I. She threw me away like garbage after 17 years while I was doing the hardest thing I ever did for us and our children. I feel like I am a good man and think she will regret what she did but I think that her having 50% of her time without her children right now is what she wants and she is the kind of person who takes what she wants. She is also prideful and narcissistic and would never admit she was wrong. 

Anyway... How do I talk to a new person about that? I would have described myself as a family man but now my family is my kids half of the time. I have of course felt worthless and inadequate since the separation. And broken. I think that ultimately it is just that I married a person whose values I thought aligned with mine and they didn’t. I think the most important decision I ever made, to marry her, was a bad decision though I did not know it at the time.

I’m not worried about getting dates. I’m quiet but (forgive me this next part but the anonymity of the internet allows me to be a little more blunt than I normally would be) I am attractive, in good shape, tall, smart, kind, and talented. I just worry that people will think something is fundamentally wrong with me because of what happened with my marriage. That is something I’ve questioned. It just didn’t work out? That’s not really it.

These men all have a PhD and said that men like them enjoy conversing with me but not to date me.

I have a few degrees and have an interesting career with a wide range of worldly experiences. I am well-mannered and very pragmatic about almost everything. My ex is a professor and cheated on me with a whole bunch of women who don’t look as good as I am nor anywhere close to being as well-educated. That really hurt me and took me a long while to get back my confidence. We are still friends after the divorce and he still likes talking with me and sometimes (before Covid) asked me to go to his university events with him, because he was always proud of me and liked to show me off.

I value education and used to be around people with the same level of education or higher, but after divorce i thought i wanted to try something different. I met a couple of community college educated guys who said they weren’t threatened by my education, so I thought cool. At first i enjoyed talking with them, and then I got bored pretty quickly when the conversations couldn’t go beyond what they know or their interests. I met another guy with a master’s degree, and he had to prepare topics for conversations before our dates. A couple of times he would have the questions or topics written down before meeting me. Another guy also told me that he had to read up and prepare before he went on a date with me.

I do not know what i did that they think they had to do that. I usually just show up and don’t start the conversation until the guy does and go with the flow. I can talk about anything except cars. In my opinion, i never tried to be intellectual or intelligent. Most of the time i just threw out one-liners unless I was asked for opinions about specific things/topics. I was just being my laidback self most of the time, and have a tendency to make fun of myself or of the situation.

And yeah, I live in a van.  I guess you could call it ""houseless on purpose"".  I just enjoy the lifestyle. I've been doing it for nine years.

So here's the nuts and bolts of it: I meet a nice woman through mutual friends. We're doing this socially distance party thing.  Where I live you're allowed ten people per group, six feet apart.  There's obviously chemistry and we're hitting it off.  As we're walking up the beach back to the parking lot she wants to keep the night going.  I say ""sure, this is my home.  Wanna hang out and drive up to the mountain for a sunset?"" The look on her face was like a deflated balloon.  It didn't end with a mountainous sunset.

And this isn't the first time it's happened.  I've got a Tinder profile, I explicitly say I live in my van full-time for financial and adventure reasons.  I still match with women which means they aren't reading my profile buy just looking at the pics. ..  We'll go on a date and throughout the course of the night, the topic will come up.  It doesn't end well.

I'm just wondering what's up.  I'm just wondering if there's a stigma against it.  Like, I'm not some crackhead making meth in the back of a clapped out RV.   I didn't get kicked out by my ex-wife and I'm living in my van (never married no kids).  I'm not a bum.  I just live for adventure, I've lived in a dozen countries in my lifetime and I've been to over 85.   Legitimately the only difference between me and another guy is that my house is on four wheels, it costs me 1/4 of what people paying to live in a place.  Even with my mortgage I'm still making money.  And that's nothing to say of all the other things I have going on in my life.

And it's not even about the money.  I just truly and deeply enjoy going on adventures, exploring my backyard (socially distance of course) and living my best life.  It's not like I'm some student eating canned chili like a homeless person.

I dunno just frustrating with the dating lately.  Maybe it's covid who knows.  Pre covid there was no problem finding those pixie wanderlust fairies who loved going on a road trip and living in 60 square feet.  Maybe times are changing and I'm just getting old.

I hope everyone is happy and had a great weekend (for those reading this on a Monday). I have some requested insight/question to ask all of you fine people.

   I (46M) did OLD a few years back, before swipe apps took over and had above average sucess with it and enjoyed it even. I had no problems finding women that I could get interested in and once a meeting was set up, get excited about. It didn’t always work out, but quite a few times it certainly did. 

   Since then, Ive moved to a large US city (large enough to have pro sports teams) and have recently went ‘back out there‘ and I have to say the quality of profiles have significatnly dropped since (and Im sure this isnt gender based at all). Im no great shakes in the looks department ( a 6 at best, a 7 if i wear a tie), but I can’t seem to find a single person in this multiple million people city that I’m interested in online. I can’t tell if its me being too picky, the pandemic still keeping folks away , or have people become so boring? What Ive found in profiles so far:

\- Nearly ALL are blank (even on paid sites, non swipe). If there’s a write up which is rare, its sparse or super negative. Did we collectively stop writing ”about me”s? Did creative writing stop being a thing?

\- Photos are 3-4 selfies ... often in the same outfit, same day. Nothing interesting that I can grab ahold of and comment. I can swipe through 500 profiles and literally see none with anything but selfies only. 

\-Replies are never more than 1-3 lines. Ive yet to receive a paragraph in reply when my replies are of decent length.

\- The rare time that I match with someone, the conversation has yet to be engaging. Not once. This of course could be my fault. I try but the lack of profile/ photos makes it challenging.

This isnt a rant, or gender based. I’m just curious if things have changed or have you noticed? Have people just given up? Maybe its the pandemic and what’s still on there are ‘bottom of the barrel’ profiles? I’m not faulting the people, as I’m sure they’re wonderful human beings, I just dont understand the 100% lack of any effort. There are profiles that are far worse of course (Snapchat filters, “just ask” write ups etc) but I’m more talking about the average person that could very well be on here. Are you one of those people that put no effort in? Maybe it still works out and I have to give up on caring about such things?

  Have things changed or am I being too picky?

Not really because I was sad, but because I was SO damn frustrated and discouraged. The men would seem great via text and/or phone conversations and then, when we meet, they lose their damn minds or something. For example, I talked to one guy for a few weeks via text/telephone, and the conversations were great. He was intelligent, kind, and funny. He didn't ask for any nudes or send any unsolicited dick pics 🙄 (It is sad that I even feel the need to mention that, but that is the dating world we live in today, unfortunately). Not once was sex mentioned during any of these conversations, and there was minimal flirting. My profile even stated very clearly... ""If you are only looking for a hook up, you should look elsewhere.""

Anyway, long story short, I met him at his friends' house (wife and husband + another friend). We all sat outside and had a few drinks. I wasn't there 30 min when he invited me to come inside to ""talk,"" as it was kinda cold outside. He led me into a bedroom and starts undressing himself and tries to kiss and undress me. I'm like ""Stop. Stop. This is NOT why I came over here."" He persists and tries to kiss me again, but sees that I'm not having it, and pulls away. I looked at him, obviously disappointed, and said ""Wow. Seriously?""
He didn't say anything, so I said ""I think I should go."" He stays quiet so I just walked out of the room and down the hallway, and then here come condescending remarks from the room, ""I know, I know. ... Im such a piece of shit... yeah, I'm the asshole... I'm so ridiculous... Blah blah blah.. ,"" and I walk outside towards my car and turn to see if he is behind me, but no... He didn't even walk to the door as I left. He just let's me leave, alone. I never heard from him again, (not that I ever wanted to), but you see my point. 

That is just one example of the type of experiences I've had with OLD, and I just don't know if I want to deal with that BS again. I love sex.. and I want it, but I can't just jump into bed with any and every guy I date one time. I have had some one night stands in the past because hey.. you can only be lonely so long before you NEED some type of physical contact, but that seems to be the expectation of MOST every man I have met via OLD. You are a whore if you put out on the first date and they don't respect you... and you are a prude and a bitch if you don't put out on the first date. I feel like I just can't win either way. Ugh.. I'm getting off topic. Sorry... 

So someone asked me the other day, ""Are you actively looking?"" I had to say no because, how the hell do you ""look"" for someone today if not online? Even Pre-COVID, the options are pretty limited. I work full time and have two side jobs doing home health, so I have no idea where or how I could possibly meet anyone in a spontaneous, natural way. I am content being single. I have a good career. My children are now 19 &amp; 20. I have an amazing family. But I do want to find love again at some point. I just fear that my options for finding that someone are running out. So that's all, I guess. I can't be the only one that feels this way, surely. Thanks for listening to me whine and complain.

First, there are too many options.  Normally, that is a good thing, but most of them cost a serious amount of money with no workable free trial period or something that doesn't require access to my credit card.  Sure, I can check online reviews, but a LOT of those are paid for by the company and therefore unreliable.  The rest are written by hopeless romantics who are riding high on the honeymoon period of a relationship they finally managed to get after YEARS of acrively searching.  I've tried asking people in person, but the best and most common response I get is, ""I dunno,"" accompanied by a shrug of the shoulders.

Then, once you find a place, it's IMPOSSIBLE to make a meaningful connection.  Every physical woman I've talked to says they have to dig through a veritable mountain of garbage people only to find that nearly every ""single"" guy is either hopelessly hung up on his ex or just wants sex (or both).  And for us men, it's even worse!  You have to reach out to LITERALLY HUNDREDS of women to even have a chance of a response and most of the women that reply get bored easily and lose interest if they aren't being love-bombed, ESPECIALLY THE WOMEN WHO SAY THEY DON'T WANT TO BE LOVE-BOMBED.

Sure, I could keep trying and be patient, but that costs money, a LOT more for men than for women, by the way, as much as 5 times what women are charged.  If I wanted to pay through the nose to get a woman's attention, I'D HIRE A PROSTITUTE!

The ""free"" ones are either a scam or Reddit, which is so beseeched by trolls as to be completely unworthy of even the most desperate lounge lizard in search of a one-night stand.

It's such a waste of my time, energy, and sometimes money.  All of it.  I'm just going to crawl back into my black abyss now.

The connection was instant and we had about 3 to 4 dates, shared a lot of kisses (no sex) and alot of messaging and video calls but we never visited each other's home. I really liked him but some things just didn't sit well with me. 

He has his own company and would work the whole morning or pretty much the whole day. If he wasn't working, he would be spending time with his mum, sister, or meeting up with a friend in the day which never bodered me but, all I was left with were little chit chats. He was also into playing guiter/his music in the evenings while having his beer, and he over did the whole ""enjoying life more and putting myself first"". Meanwhile, I have a 7yr old, studying full time at uni and on clinical placement but I always made time.

When we met, he mentioned that he and his ex girlfriend broke up because she was ""controlling"", she felt unappreciated because he didn't prioritise her and that she threw tantrums everytime she sends him a message and he didn't reply on time, therefore he doesn't want it to be a problem when he does not reply to messages on time. I thought fair enough,  we both have lives to live, but then he overdid it. His warning also made me supper careful about expressing how disrespectful I found this behaviour when he later started doing it to me, cos I didn't want to sound like a nag or be like his ex (smart move on his part). 

With me: he blew hot and cold, had on a few occasions not reply to messages for over 8 hours despite being online,  and a couple of other funny things he did like getting super defensive when I saw his profile after we had both established that we were only talking to each other. A pushback from me in response to some of those behaviours eg me ignoring his messages for hours with no sensible excuse afterwards got him in his feelings and we just decided to stay ""friends"", but even that didn't go well as he would make promises/plans to meet up for coffee but wouldn't follow through or acknowledge it at all. So, I ended up walking away/cutting ties for a few month's. 

We had such a great connection, he was quite lovely and we found each other incredibly attractive, but I sensed he was prideful and those behaviours were a manipulative way of gaining control. He once jokingly mentioned that I look like I have a lot of options and he would have found it hard to think I was single if not for OLD. He also mentioned that I had no idea how much he liked me but he would rather make sure I don't get it way in my head or get  too comfortable (not sure where all that came from). 
My question is, was I fair in abruptly cutting ties? Was I overreacting or is this what dating is like this days? I feel rusty getting back out after all this years and it feels tiring already. 

He is 42 and I am 32 so I don't know if age had anything to do with it? I've always had a personal preference for slightly older men because I find thier emotional maturity and intellect most compatible with mine but I won't lie, this experience has had me thinking otherwise.

Pls any comments on what you think was happening (eg red flags), or advice for the future will be much appreciated.

 I (23) was seeing/dating this man(43) since January. He travels often for work (every 2-3-4 weeks) because he owns hotels. He’s a very active person, since he was young he doesn’t stay in a place more than a month, he has traveled a lot when he was younger (backpacker). He doesn’t have kids, hasn’t married. He’s not from my country, but he’s been living here for 15 years. He’s not romantic but he’s very direct, so I don’t really have a problem with that.

On January (the third time I saw him) he invited me to a house he has out of my city (4 hours from here). We stayed there 3 days and he tried to have sex with me and I told him that if I have sex with someone I don’t want it to be something casual, that I just want to have sex with someone if we’re both willing to have a relationship. He understood and we didn’t have sex in that ocassion. Next time I saw him we had sex (I started to like him since that day) and we talked about what I told him the other day, he told me that he wanted to know me better and go out with me (he basically accepted what I told him that I wanted) but he also told me he usually takes this things slow.

So a month later (Feb 19) he traveled to one of his hotels that is in the middle of the jungle, he stayed there for 2 weeks. Since he came back from there we’ve been seeing each other often, he has introduced me to some of his friends. I started to trust him even though on the inside I always had insecurities about him having sex with other girls (just because I don’t know him well and bc he’s impulsive and always moving from one place to another). He told me he wanted to earn my trust. So I decided to trust him and to not speculate over things I can’t control or find out. I respected his space, he respected mine and everything was going fine.

So yesterday I decided to log into a fake account I have with some friends on ig and that I haven’t used in a while (bc for some reason it gives me anxiety). I follow random girls in that account and I saw a story of a girl that follows him on ig (he follows her back). I decided to see her profile out of curiosity and she has a lot of pictures in the same city where his hotel is located (seems like she lives there). So in her highlight stories she has one with the name of this place and I started watching all the stories and found out she was in his hotel and in other story I saw his car on the back (according to the date it was 6-7 weeks ago, the same weeks he was there). 

Right now he’s in another city for work and he has to go to that hotel within the next days. I told him to call me because I wanted to talk to him. When he called me I sent him her profile asking who she was, at first he was confused, but then he told me she was a girl he met there (I think he had already met her before). I asked him if he had sex with her he said no at first. Then I sent him the stories and asked him if she was with her the last time he went there and he said yes, but he was with his other friends too (friends that work and live there). He asked me if she was my friend, I said yes and that if he had something with her I rather hear it from him because I was going to ask her anyways. He accepted it. Long story  short, he apologized for what he did, he told me he didn’t like her, that he likes me and wants to have something serious with me that I’m an incredible girl and that I don’t deserve what he did to me. He said that he acted like an “animal” (that’s the word he uses and I think it describes him well bc he’s very impulsive in many ways). I told him that I always respected him and I was very clear about what I wanted and expected from him (respect/ exclusivity) and that I know my worth and I don’t deserve this at all. That he lost an “incredible and gorgeous girl” just because he decided to have sex with a girl he says he doesn’t even like. He told me that he did that when we started dating (it happened a month after we had sex for the first time), that he didn’t think about it and that after he came back from there we have been talking and going out more, so he didn’t think he was doing something wrong because he was single (we’re still single but I always talked about exclusivity and respect). Finally I told him that if he did that one time he will do it again, that I deserve better and that I don’t want to keep seeing him. He accepted it, apologized again and told me he expects to see me when he comes back, just to talk. 

I like him, I have feelings for him but there are also things I don’t like about him. Because of the pandemic is hard to date other guys . I’ve been single for 5 years so right now I rather just date one guy or have a relationship with someone.

What do you guys think about this? I feel bad but at the same time I know I acted right all this months so I shouldn’t feel this way. He had sex with that girl when we started dating, do you consider that as cheating/betraying? Would you forgive him? Should I accept talking to him in person when he comes back?
