2,pzrdkq,1633163830,I need advice,"Hey so iam a 17year old, and iam dating a 14year old for a year now, me and her know the age difference so does my parents and hers. Iam not a bad guy I love her to death, and so does she, we've known each other for almost 2 years now, I've broken up with her because of the age gap but I just couldn't be without her she means alot to me I'm willing to do everything for her I feel so happy with her. Her parents love me I work hard all summer get money flip bikes, am in love with games, cars, bikes iam not a fuck boy I don't tease around with other girls or sum. Her family knows about the age difference but they agree with us because they think that it's true love. And we don't think it's love we know it. We've been thru so many fights and bs like other couples but we cope with each other, we talk like 10+hours plus for the past 400+days and not get tired of each other idno it's just her smile and her personality that makes me love her. She says that she truly loves me she feels safe around me. Our friends don't mind us dating because they've seen how our relationship is, we truly balieve that we can date till marriage. And I really want to spend the rest of my life with her. Me and her family went on trips and so did she with my family.  Iam not attracted to younger girls, actually I like older women iam not even lying I like 30+yrl women but this girl turns my heart upside down I just cannot I love her to death, iam going to turn 18 in a couple of months and she'll be 14.  Not gonna hide it but we've had se* I didn't force her nor I put myself on her, I've never forced her to do anything everything just happened by itself. Iam not ashamed of it neither is she, never asked for nu*es or anything. The only pics Ivve asked from her are her smile and face because i love seeing her smile, and her in a dress because I imagine her in a wedding dress idno why... 

Am I wrong for dating her? What should I do? Should I break up? Should I continue dating her, because I feel something I've never felt love besides her?

6,pzrq8a,1633165658,Obsessive behaviour towards new dates,"I recently met a wonderful boy I can't stop thinking about, and we've only seen each other twice. The problem is that I am obsessed with him, days after we've seen each other I can't catch my breath to do something else, I procrastinate and do nothing while I think and go back to our 2 meetings. He is emotionally intelligent, we have wonderful communication, everything is with cards on the table from day 1. I haven't had such a close relationship with anyone so far, he is also not very experienced, but he has experience compared to me.

From our first meeting we started with a lot of physical contact, everything became super natural, as this is the strongest sign of sympathy for both of us. The second meeting was already intimate, without anything particularly sexual, we were just took our clothes off, cuddled, and talked. I think I need to note that this is definitely the aspect + the easy and pure communication of course that keeps me in the whirlwind.

The problem is also that at the moment I don't have much to do from work and university and I can't find something to distract me. I feel that this is toxic to me, but subconsciously when I try to distract myself with something, my thinking always quickly returns to him and our 2 dates.

My question: do you have any advice on how not to be so obsessed with it, for me to be able to focus on other things?

There's this girl(21or 20F) whom I've met multiple times 2 years ago, she has even sat behind me in my bike, she enjoys talking to me &amp; it's obvious with the uncontrollable smile she has whenever she speaks to me. We even went to a trek together with group of people. This group involved a guy who's my aquintence(say X) whom i play football &amp; cricket with, he's her classmate and her old friend too. So now me and this girl on the way back home were having a conversation for maybe an hour, it was as if she didn't want to end this conversation and she seemed so happy, even i was surprised to see us get along so well. Then midway we went for dinner &amp;  X sat next to her. I even saw him touching her and getting sensual, i looked away as i believe it's her battle and must not interfere unless she's vocal about her security. We got back on our journey and this girl looks sad &amp; doesn't even try to look in my direction. I wanted to ask her out on a date, but because of this it never happened. Two days later i asked her on text that why she looked upset... she said she was sleepy.

Then i tried contacting her once more and within 2 mins she gave reason that she's busy with studies. We continued streaking on snapchat for 2 more years.

Later i came to know that these both were dating, but since a year I've seen him in multiple occasions with other girls out.

Yesterday, i spoke to her on text just on a casual topic and later i asked her out on a date, she said that she isn't interested in dating anyone right now. I said we would just meet up once &amp; it's alright if she doesn't want to. She replied that she isn't comfortable meeting me. I replied that i respect her decision... End of conversation.

I never got this reply before from any girl because i always maintain my physical boundries, but right now I'm feeling as if I'm being a threat to her safety. And it's badly eating up my head.

Is it creepy to ask a girl out i know for a date on text? I mentioned date because I wanted to be clear about my romantic intentions. FYI We still snap on snapchat, My mom knows her mom too. And we have many more mutual connections, but she's uncomfortable meeting me!!!

Hi everyone. We all know I go for ‚Äúbad boys‚Äù or people with mental health problems. I just want one real chance with him, idk why.

We met around the 2nd week of September as friends in the psych ward together but it developed into something more. For the most part, we have the same sense of humor but ever since I got out of the psych ward mid September my life has been a mess.

I‚Äôm currently living out of hotels because I have an extremely dysfunctional family. My only safe places are at hotels so I can complete my partial mental health day programs, on top of waiting to see if my application is approved for a mid October move in date, as well as doing many interviews for technology companies after my day program is over. I have unreliable help to for my physical needs. 

I‚Äôm quadriplegic and this is the first time I‚Äôve been mostly independent since I‚Äôve been injured in May 2019. I‚Äôm in a very sensitive state right now and usually I can take dark humor jokes but not right now, as I am very manic and don‚Äôt really have a clear path, everything things in limbo, and I really don‚Äôt have a support system. I just got diagnosed with BPD, bipolar I, along with my other mental illnesses which are complex ptsd, depression and anxiety.

The guy who I met at the psych ward is an alcoholic yet is very kind and I know he cares about me since he‚Äôs done a lot for me after the psych ward, but I think I‚Äôm just too much for him to handle right now due to my mental state. He‚Äôs telling me it‚Äôs not me it‚Äôs him and he doesn‚Äôt think he can be here for me since he‚Äôs on the road working a lot but I really don‚Äôt need that much attention. I don‚Äôt care about how often people text me, if I‚Äôm able to see you once or twice a week, I‚Äôm good. Just text me once in a while. 

Oh I‚Äôve talked to numerous mental health professionals and they say I‚Äôm fine from a self harm stand point, I just have a lot going on. He was telling me all these things that we could do together when I was stable in the psych ward. I think I‚Äôm just too much for him to handle right now and he criticizes me for so many things, I just feel like I‚Äôm not good enough for him.

My ex-boyfriend with a heroin and drug addict, I told myself I‚Äôd never date someone with addiction issues, but the guy the psych ward dude did so many good things for me regarding my physical health and mental health, it‚Äôs hard to let him go despite him being very insensitive to my situation right now and making tasteless jokes about my part and self harm tendencies.

For example, I have CPTSD and right now since I‚Äôm very sensitive everything is triggering and I tried to explain to him that. He‚Äôs a very aggressive driver and I told him to slow down I‚Äôm having a panic attack yet he didn‚Äôt listen. (I have ptsd from a motor cycle hitting my car in a large city and watching him die).

And then at the hospital, (after psych ward for urology reasons), I needed emergency surgery and he brought me there and stayed for as long as he could. Something happened where I became really sad and he started making tasteless jokes about my attempts last summer. He put a plastic bag over his head like I did last year as an attempt which put me in a darker mood. My anxiety and cptsd were so bad I lost all strength in my body including my arms which I have normal arm movement.

He mentioned to me that he thinks that I‚Äôm using him, but I paid him the other day when he helped me, I paid for his gas and parking tickets multiple times, I even bought us food. He tells me over criticize what he wears, his taste isn‚Äôt really my style but I really don‚Äôt care what he wears because I like him more as a person rather than what he looks like. I just like to joke around with him and be like I ‚Äúpimp your ride‚Äù and he got offended so I respected him telling me that and won‚Äôt bring it up.

He came over to my hotel last night for about two hours, I bought us dinner, I‚Äôm smoking weed like a chimney right now because my doctor won‚Äôt adjust my anxiety meds. He says he doesn‚Äôt want to be a stoner which I am a stoner but I‚Äôm not addicted, if he really was interested in me then I would cut back on the smoking. Yesterday he told me he wanted me to/agreed with me to do s*x work to make extra money, so I did check my phone a few times when I was with him but I know was rude but I‚Äôm literally homeless and am blowing throw the money I took out from my 401k and stock market. If he really wanted me to not do it, I wouldn‚Äôt.

I texted him telling him I‚Äôll stop trying to do s*x work to make extra money‚Ä¶still waiting for him to respond back. I haven‚Äôt seen him in maybe a week or so, I was very touchy-feely yesterday, we cuddled and nothing else. 

He gets very uncomfortable when he comes to sex even though he‚Äôs really good when he is comfortable. He gets performance anxiety, which has never really happened to me except for one time with another guy, so I felt like I‚Äôm the problem why he can‚Äôt get hard. And I mentioned that to him and before he left the hotel he just told me he doesn‚Äôt think things are going to work out with between us which I wasn‚Äôt really expecting that.

Should I just accept it, focus on my self and move on? He has done so many things for me that I can‚Äôt explain on Reddit. And I told myself I‚Äôd never give an addict a chance but he told me to put my walls down and to give him one. I feel like a fool. I literally was talking to at least 5-7 guys waiting for me but I ghosted and dropped them all because I wanted to get to know him and he told me he wouldn‚Äôt talk to other girls.

I know sex on a first date is a bit much, and I promised myself I wouldn‚Äôt have sex with him - but he was so sweet it just felt right in the moment.

The morning after, he tells me it was the best he‚Äôs ever had and asked for my number, suggesting to meet up again next week. We have so much in common and just clicked so well on the date, and the chemistry was nothing like I‚Äôve had with any other guy. I‚Äôm down for something casual with him but also open for it to become more serious if the opportunity were ever to come up.

The only issue is that he takes so long to reply. Normally I‚Äôm fine with slow repliers, because I am one myself. And I‚Äôm used to his slow replies because when we were talking on Bumble we usually took hours to respond to each other - but the conversation was always worth the wait. But after the first date and meeting irl I was half expecting him to be a little faster with replies but it seems to be going the same pace as before. Usually I reply slow on dating apps (because talking to multiple people at once is exhausting for me sometimes) and when I make a connection with someone I start to reply much faster to that person. I thought maybe it would be the same for him but it‚Äôs just starting to make me feel as though maybe he‚Äôs not into me as I thought he was?

It got to the point where I almost gave up on him and went back to talking to my other matches when he suddenly made me a personalised music playlist with all my favourite artists I mentioned to him on our date. Obviously I found this incredibly cute - music is literally my love language and the fact he remembered what I told him on our date just seemed so sweet to me.

So am I just reading into the slow replies too much? I‚Äôm not sure whether I want something serious or casual yet (just seeing where things go) so I don‚Äôt mind about the fact we had sex on the first date and also the prospect of him potentially talking to other girls at this stage doesn‚Äôt bother me much (as we‚Äôre certainly not exclusive after just one date). I just want to know whether he‚Äôs actually interested in me or not and whether it‚Äôs worth pursuing him. Our time together, conversations and the fact he took the time to make me a playlist suggests that he could be into me but the fact that he takes so long to reply just tells me that he‚Äôs probably not as invested as I think he is.

For reference: it would sometimes take 6-12 hours to receive a reply from him but he would always reply with multiple messages/paragraphs (not dead chat)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pzvzms/cant_tell_if_hes_actually_into_me/
32,pzw10x,1633184355,"Online dating - Letting them know you really like their profile without sounding too generic, or too forward","I'm just wondering about this: a scenario where you see somebody's profile, and after reading the whole thing and looking at all their photos, it really leaves you with a positive feeling about this person. A combination of all the different elements of their profile leaves you thinking ""wow, I think I'd really like to get to know them, this really resonates with me"".

The thing is, however, that their answers to the prompts (think Bumble, Hinge, eHarmony) are not overly deep or detailed - although sometimes that isn't a bad thing - in many cases, a simple, well-constructed profile can still be effective in evoking an idea of what they are like.

The question is, how to let them know that you really like their profile and how it makes you feel, without making it sound overly generic? That is, convey that you actually *read* the thing, and actually put some thought and effort into writing that message, and express yourself. Something like ""your profile really piqued my interest, I really think we'd click, I get really good vibes from your profile, yada yada"". I guess the idea is to be *confident,* but without giving a sense that you already know them or creeping them out (it's important to keep in mind that you're actually dealing with a stranger here).

I have been speaking to a guy \[34/M\] on Bumble for a little while, and we are organising a date. I have a bunch of health problems, which I have disclosed, aside from my severe hand (and sometimes body) tremor. It will be evident as soon as he meets me.

I have essential tremor, which is a benign, non-degenerative condition. I am currently investigating surgery and hoping it will be gone by sometime next year, but I'm still likely to experience a tremor sometimes. For the record, I'm otherwise cognitively fine and ironically a health professional who works with people who have serious illnesses.

How much would this tremor bother you, when you consider that it would be present when eating meals? I find eating the most difficult, which is why I'm seeking treatment.

My body tends to shake a lot during sex/when aroused. Needless to say, it does not impact my sex drive. What are your thoughts around this? Feel free to be explicit - interested in how you would feel about hand jobs with a girl who had a tremor as well.

Please include your age so that I have context.

So I have been going on dates with a couple girls and I‚Äôve been noticing a common theme that I wanted to share and get advice on. So I was dating this first girl I thought we had a good connection and we would have a lot of fun together go on dates and we did end up sleeping together a few times however, it seemed like I was the only one let initiating contact or setting up dates. So the last date I set up with this girl I got a hotel in a near by city and we went on a brewery tour and had a nice dinner and we‚Äôre just enjoying each other‚Äôs company and I brought up the fact that I didn‚Äôt feel like she wanted to hang out with me because I always contact her first and that it makes me feel insecure so if she wants to hang out again she will have to contact me and after I dropped her off that day I never heard from her again. Fast forward a couple months I‚Äôm dating another girl we seem to be really hitting it off and I think things are going good our conversation flies I really enjoy her company and this time we haven‚Äôt slept together which I think is good to feel each other out. (We have made out a few times) But I experiencing similar traits where I find I have initiate all contact and set up all the dates. Which I understand which is fine like two or three dates in in my mind. However once I get like 5 dates in I feel that other person would know what they want. And I feel as though maybe I‚Äôm setting my expectations too high so early on maybe or they just aren‚Äôt that into it?

So I directly messaged the girl on facebook asking her out for dinner.

She told that she recently went through a difficult break up and wasn't interested in getting into another relationship.

We spoke on the phone  where despite my best efforts to flirt, she repeatedly expressed her desire to only be friends - She started telling me about how she met my sister and about her ex.

She wants to have a platonic relationship and become friends - I even mentioned I was happy to wait for her to get over her ex and then give me a chance. This ended with a resounding no.

I feel like I've been immediately friendzoned. She quicky clamped down on all my attempts to flirt.

I don't want to be that guy she speaks to about other guys she's interested in as frankly speaking that's just not what I want.

Should I try and be friends with her and slowly flirt with her or should I just move on?

Does anyone actually manage to become friends with someone they want to be in a relationship with?

46,pzxnra,1633189659,Could depression/life trauma and cheating be connected?,"Can depression be a reason someone would leave a supportive, seemingly happy relationship for someone else?

I am asking on behalf of my (29F) ex boyfriend (M30). I've been with him for nearly 3 years and met him during the worst part of his life. His dad died a little over a year ago, he recently had to put his mother in a nursing home due to health issues, and on top of all that his dog passed away suddenly. He watched his dad slowly die and had to quit his job to take care of both with no help from anyone. He developed a drinking problem because of all of this. 

I have tried to be there as much as he let me. I was even there when we had to call the ambulance for his dad 2 days before he died. He often would get angry at me and push me away but would always come back. 

2 months ago, he said he was done with the roller-coaster of our relationship and only wanted to be with me. We talked about living together, getting married, and kids. Everything was going so good. This was prior to his dog dying. His dog died 3 weeks ago, the same time he put his mom in the nursing home. This weekend is his father's celebration of life (the funeral was postponed due to covid). He initially leaned on me for support. 2 weeks ago he was still spending the weekend with me and saying he loved me. Sunday night of that weekend he told me he needed a break from a relationship because he was bitter about everything and didn't want to take anything out on me. Last weekend I found out he went out on a date with someone he had known for a few years but wasn't close to. He never talked to her or had any interaction up until that point because he gave me complete access to his phone. He is now seeming to want to be with her. I confronted him and he got angry which is a typical response for him. 

I just don't understand what happened. There was no fight, no warning. I gave him the space he requested and sincerely thought we'd be fine. He introduced me to everyone and all his friends seemed to like me and wanted him to marry me at some point. I really think this all has to do with his world being completely thrown upside down and a combination of substance abuse and severe depression. 

I'd like a perspective from someone who is actively going through depression and if this sounds plausible.

They say that they don't like dating shorter men not because they are shorter, or the height difference bothers them but because they want to feel safe and protected. To me that seems to imply that shorter guys can't make a women feel those things. Now I am a natural bodybuilder, so I have plenty of muscle. I am only 5'9 however and prefer women taller than me. When I hear a comment like this it tends to confuse me. I would definitely defend anybody that was being bullied or talked about especially if I was in a relationship with this person. Plus my muscular frame does tend to make people back down or at least think twice before speaking to me. 

So what is the real reason tall 6'+ women wont date shorter guys? Do you really want to feel safe and protected? 

Let me say I would jump of a bridge, mountain, or literally do anything to be with a taller women. In fact I have a friend she is 6'5 I am incredibly comfortable around her and when I am enjoying her company, which is all the time because we get on so well, I don't notice or even care that I have to look up at her plus I think it makes her look all the more attractive when she wears heels.

I met this really awesome guy on the Hinge dating app a few weeks ago and there were instant sparks. We went on several dates and texted back and forth a lot when we weren't together. Things were going really well but we weren't exclusive yet. We were both looking for the same thing (serious relationship) but we didn't have the ""exclusivity"" talk yet.

So I went on a date with an old co-worker because I figured it wouldn't hurt anything.

He seemed caught off guard when I mentioned this and it was like he completely lost interest in me the second he heard that.

So, 2 years ago I was living in the US with my boyfriend. I only moved there from London for him. We were together for about 3 years. I don't want to go too deep into that but he was a very troubled person. He had a heart of gold but his life didn't treat him well, he was suffering from a lot of trauma. And he would turn to destroying coping mechanism like heroin. I did my absolute best to help him. I spent all my money on his therapy, rehab, meds, things that would make him happy. I didn't leave his side. I don't know what else I could've done but apparently that wasn't enough. He hanged himself in the bathroom when I was asleep in the next room.

Fast forward 2 very difficult, very sad years of living with my mother, I'm back in London. Got a job I've been studying for my whole life, I'm back with my friends. And here's the deal with one of my friends. I like him a lot. We hang out very often and he's so so kind to me. He's been there for me when I really needed him. Not only after my boyfriend's death. 

He's already admitted that he has a thing for me. Even though he's not generally into guys. And I think I'd like to give this a shot. But I'm afraid that guilt would eat me up alive. I wouldn't stand being judged by other people over how quickly I moved on (I haven't). And there are my huge abandonment issues. I'm not sure I'd be a very good partner right now. And I don't want my friend to feel like he's a consolation prize. 

TL;DR I want to start dating again after my boyfriend's death but I'm afraid of being judged or getting hurt again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pzzjvc/m24_im_afraid_to_start_dating_someone_i_like/

62,q009q5,1633198210,Help: how to avoid an ex-ish,"Hey this is gonna be a long one

I‚Äôm in grad school (30 m) and a fellow grad student (21 F) had been watching the really late and talking till 3 o clock in the morning.  We also climb and workout together. Eventually one of those nights, we were both drinking. First we started playing footsies then I asked if I could sit next to hurt and massage her legs. She said yes to this so for the next hour we are next to each other as I‚Äôm madsaging her and holding hands with her. She mention she was gonna head to bed and I asked I ask if she would mind if I kissed her. She said she wouldn‚Äôt mind so we end up making out. I end leaving because we were both drunk and I didn‚Äôt want to regret anything. As I‚Äôm walking home she texts me how she is wet between the legs so we start sexting.

Next morning I ask when we can leave where we left off. She says she thinks last night was a big mistake. I tell her I disagree but I wanna respect her boundaries but I‚Äôm into her and let me know if those boundaries change. We keep texting and 5 days later we are texting about a music artists and she says I should list 2 sexually explicit songs that have lyrics like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a freak‚Äù and ‚ÄúI wanna fuck you like a dog‚Äù. I mention another artist and she sends me more songs like this. I point this out and she just says she‚Äôs continuing the conversation. I start sending her similar songs and we go back and forth for 6 more songs. The next day her and a bunch of fellow grad students are getting tacos and I ask ‚Äúmind if come?‚Äù She says it‚Äôs up to you. I show up and things seem different but I offer her a ride back to her place but she wants to go with a friend. I take this as a sign that I‚Äôve creeped her out.

Unfortunately at this point, I have a group project with her, and she hasn‚Äôt gotten back to be about the adjustments that need to be made to her part. I try to setup a meeting. Radio silence for 24 hrs. I say ‚ÄúI need some communication if you need me to take over your part I can‚Äù She says ‚Äúshe can meet but she doesn‚Äôt wanting me to force anything‚Äù
We meet and get the project done.

I‚Äôm now back all the way off and don‚Äôt talk to her at all. Because I‚Äôm super confused and this seems like a one-sided relationship. I stop talking or see her at run ins for a week. I make a dumb mistake and invite her and her friend over for out weekly show. She says can she bring a friend over, I say ‚Äúyeah?‚Äù She ends up bringing a guy over she met in the past week at climbing. He sits with his arm wrapped around her the entire show. This is a gut punch to me so I pull back even further.

2 weeks after this; We text every other day about work stuff but I am avoiding seeing her outside of work. She texts me ‚ÄúIts pretty clear you dont actually want to be friends and were only trying to get into my pants so I'll stop reaching out about climbing etc‚Äù I told her I‚Äôm just following her directions and not try to force anything. She then says I hurt her and took advantage of her when we were drunk by kissing her. I then ask how come she is texting somebody she doesn‚Äôt trust and that she feels took advantage of her? She says she‚Äôs just trying to set the terms of the friendship and that she just wants to see me when I‚Äôm around others. I say cool I‚Äôm fine with that and we stop texting conversation

So the question is why did she text me yesterday and what is the best way of maintain work relationship? I‚Äôm trying to continue to avoid her because it literally hurts me in the heart to be around her. Also just need support because we were good friends before this

 I've been talking to this guy that I met on tinder for a few weeks. We went on a first date and it went well. He lives an hour away from me and he told me that he usually doesn't drive an hour to meet someone, and that he didn't think that he'd want to date someone so soon after getting out of a relationship a few months ago, but that there was just something about me.

He told me that he's falling for me and obsessed with me and that he could see himself spending his life with me, and that he might be my perfect match, and that the reason that other dates I went on didn't lead anywhere was that no one else is as smart as me except for him.

We've had a few moments where we're weren't sure if we were sexually compatible. He wanted to have sex on the second date and become boyfriends if it was good and I don't like to have sex with someone that I don't know too well, especially since I'm a virgin and always imagined my first time being with someone that I was in a relationship with and really cared about and had a connection with and knew really well.

I told him that I didn't think we were sexually compatible and he said that he couldn't be with someone that wasn't sure if they wanted to be with him and said that this is goodbye for now. I was afraid to lose this guy who might be my perfect match and I'm not proud of it, but I sent him a bunch of messages asking him to give me another chance.

He said that he would, but that I acted crazy and made him lose all his feelings for me, and that he has to have sex with me to see if he can get them back. I really like this guy and don't want to lose him, and I feel awful that I made this guy who said that he was falling for me and could see himself spending his life with me not have those feelings anymore, but I'm still a little hesitant to have sex with him so soon, after just one date and a few weeks of texting.

79,q01wjt,1633203593,I lost attraction to a girl I'd been seeing for a little while and she threw a tantrum.,"Seriously, I'm tired of being made to be the bad guy. I'm just a normal 25 yr old single guy who's content being single when I had just spent the last 24 years chasing after women and finally having my heart broken to itty bitty pieces by one who physically and mentally abused me. 

I'm sick of dating if this is all that is left. 

For one, I'm meek and reserved, and I barely have an angry or abusive bone in my body. Secondly, I'm a short shit, and my abusive ex overpowered me multiple times when she didnt get her way. I've had mental health issues to the point of self harm that are somewhat under control and yet I'm the one who gets treated like shit, like the dirt under their shoes. 

I've dated 12 women in my life, 8 of them in my adult life, and after the 11th I just decided I wasn't going to make it so easy to kill me anymore. Anyone who came into my life was going to have to show effort and not make me question everything. All i want to do is marry and have children and be right with god in my relationship. That's all I want. Sweet and simple. 

This twelfth individual seemed to have fit those categories. She was very pleasing on the eyes, very intelligent and animated, wanted to settle down eventually and was a christian like me. I told myself I would put in effort if she was reciprocating. 

Now there's a wildcard about her. We haven't just met. We talked before when I was nineteen, which was nearly seven years ago for me, and people tend to change a lot overtime. She was much more mature this time around, didn't give me so much trouble and didn't start any drama like she did when we were younger. Our ""relationship"" if you could call it that, lasted less than a month, because we were both young and stupid and knew nothing about relationships. I made a mistake which forced us apart and it ultimately cost me any sort of friendship with her. 

Recently she messaged me and we started chatting and she told me she forgave me for doing what I did. I was touched by that because I had truly felt terrible for what I did and vowed never to ever again. It wasn't violent or abusive, just stupid. A man is horny and makes stupid mistakes. 

We met up and she was just super happy to see me and wanted to make out and do stuff and all that other jazz but I was being careful and didnt want to do anything right away. I wanted to go on more dates to kind of feel out the situation, see if she was being honest or not in forgiving me supposedly. 

Well, three months later and no new dates, barely communicating, and I didnt press the issue. I asked if things were okay and if we could just hang out eventually and she said maybe. So at this point I'm thinking, 'well, probably a lost cause at this point', and I wasn't really feeling it anymore. 

So i did the polite thing and just talked to her about it. I thought she would be understanding since we hadn't worked well in the past, but man was I wrong. 

I came under her fire on all her social media, messages, and she's blocked me on all of them as I share this here.

I wanted to ask for everyone‚Äôs advice / experience with living together BEFORE marriage. 

PREFACE: we do NOT have children.

Here‚Äôs my current dilemma: I (21 M) am currently living at home with my parents, I work full-time and go to school part-time at a local community college.

My girlfriend (20 F) lives with her parents and is currently working full-time as well and attends the same local community college full-time.

I have received a significant job promotion to live and work in Arizona. I have been working with this company for over two years and it is a very prominent company in itself (Amazon). I currently reside in Illinois. I will take this job offer as I will be earning a minimum of $52k/year w/o factoring in any OT hours worked.

I wouldn‚Äôt under any circumstances pursue a long-term relationship with my current girlfriend (have been dating for 1.5 years to date). Having said this, I am NOT forcing her to tag along with me to move since I feel that that in itself is a lot to ask from of a girlfriend.

If she were to not tag along however, I‚Äôd end the relationship. I‚Äôd love for her to tag along and she has already expressed her high interest in wanting to tag along as well.

I do plan on marrying this girl in the near future but feel as though, I am not ready for such a commitment this early in both my life and career.

I tend to always think worst case scenario and we have spoken about it already before (the possibility of break-up) as with any relationship could experience.

I tried to give as much background info as possible, if more is needed to form an opinion/suggestion on the situation then feel free to ask away!

I posted to the [r/datingoverfifty](https://okd.reddit.com/r/datingoverfifty) sub with a pic from today. I wish I had done this when I was younger.  It wasn‚Äôt until I was in my forties (a few years into my former marriage) when I was inspired by multiple writers who wrote on this topic. No matter your current relationship; joys, struggles or absence of partner, I‚Äôm a true advocate for carving out time for oneself. Treat yourself to the best experience that fulfills you because ‚Äúyou‚Äù have value and deserve the kindness for yourself (said in my best Stuart Smalley voice).

89,q02w0h,1633206904,You can literally break up for any reason,"I don‚Äôt understand why people feel so entitled to tell a person that‚Äôs breaking up with them that their reason for breaking up isn‚Äôt good enough especially in the talking stages. If a person comes to the conclusion of wanting to break up, don‚Äôt fight it! I have other examples but this situation is the worst. 

One guy told me it was unreasonable to not want to date him because he lied about being divorced. He said that most women didn‚Äôt care‚Ä¶..as if that justifies it. Then he told me we could be FWB since I didn‚Äôt want to date him which I also declined. 

I also told him another reason I didn‚Äôt want to date him was because one time he asked me out on a date through DM and I said yes. 3 days later, I asked him why he deleted the message and he said ‚Äúsorry I got back together with my ex girlfriend‚Äù (a new person). He told me that I should enjoy competition when I brought this back up with him.  

He told me all these horrible stories about his ‚Äúex wife‚Äù (before I knew he lied) and said she was a narcissist. Now I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs the narcissist.

With that being said, if you genuinely want to break up with someone for any reason, just do it. It‚Äôs your life and not every needs access to you.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q02w0h/you_can_literally_break_up_for_any_reason/

I f24 was asked out on a date by 29m. We‚Äôve been talking for a couple of weeks (I did ask for advice previously because he isn‚Äôt the best texter although said he really would love to meet me and you guys very kindly gave me advice that it would be probably best to meet them as soon as possible). 

I hadn‚Äôt been able to meet him in these past couple of weeks because I‚Äôve been moving plus he lives about an hour and a half travel time for me to meet him. 

The problem is that I was hoping to meet him sometime in a couple of weeks (he doesn‚Äôt know yet because he said he was free for me whenever but I was just putting plans together in my head) 

However, the next two weekends I now can‚Äôt meet him because I have to catch up on university work as I am starting a masters that I have no experience in (also I wanted my best friend to travel with me and she said she would be happy to wait for me in case the date goes wrong/she is meeting friends in the same city). 

Just I‚Äôm scared if I tell him it‚Äôs going to be another three weeks I‚Äôve blown it. Again like I know he said to not worry at all and he just wants to meet me, but at the same time I just feel like such a dick delaying it this long. Does anyone have any advice on how to tell him I‚Äôm just so nervous.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q03klj/how_long_is_too_long_to_postpone_a_date/
93,q03opm,1633209543,Stuck with a FORCEFUL GUY.,"Hello, I'm this is my first post on reddit and english is not first language. Anywyas I need some advice on a perwon that I'm seeing. Here's the story, I meet this guy(18M) on tinder, we chatted and we clicked. So, I proposed to him to go on a date to meet each other at my house to chill which I know is totally wrong but at the same time I was scared to be with him alone since I'm only 18 (girl) and my parents are overprotective. So a week pass, the day comes he's at my house and meet my parents ( I lied to them that I met him by via a friend and that I know him for a while) everything goes well my mok leaves to do some errands and my stays in the basement to do some work. While, we go upstairs to watch a movie. When seeing the movie, he asks to me cuddle I'm like sure, then he asks for a kiss and I'm mhm sure but only on the check. So, he does the same but I'm not feeling anything and not comfortable, afterwards, he leaves to meet up with his friends. We chatted for days after and he brings up that we should call have nicknames for each othwr I'm like sure ... He calls me bb...When we were talking he told me how his countries hated Jews and he showed me some comedies  or jokes made about them but in a lighthearted, I was like okay....and he also insisted to take for a ride which parents don't want too cuz they don't know the guy the same goes for me. But he still asked me multiples times I was like no and asked me what happened if he would to ask my mom. I said she sould would refuse, he was like okay. He also stated beforw we meet up a second time that how my mom would react if he told her we were bf and gf..I'm like umm idk. He also brought up his past about being a fuck boy and that he broke with his last girlfriend last year and it been a year he was in a relationship. After that we decided to meet up a second time for the second week at the mall, he meets parents everything goes go fine and I go with him alone to eat and we eat outside the mall, which purposely brought up about the contest who would win the bet for the first time which Idk how to respond to on his text. So, he won the contest and start kissing me which I thought would be a simple kiss which turn into making out and Idk how to react so I followed along. Afterwards he stops after doing it to times, he says it was good but I was to fast and that I should let him guide me I was like no i just want a simple kiss or one on the cheek but he insisted and I just give a simple kiss and we leave after to shop more. We are at a store qnd he says mention while we were lining up to pay our stuff at the cashier that we look good togheter , I'm like yea.. He also while we were sitting didnt stop keeping me closer or hugging me which I'm like im fine with it but he did stop sometimes when I was trying to see some stuff and while we walking I would hold his hand and if I wasnt near him he would pull me multiplrd back to him. Anyways after that he asks if he could go to my houses sobwe could have more private time, I'm like sureee.... He comes at my house  where my mom was upstairs and my dad downstairs. So, we decided to continue to watch the movie we didnt finish last week. While watching it, he would cuddle none stop and kissing me. When he would kiss me he would want to make out I was like avoiding hima nd telling him instead to kiss me on the cheek ( I really didn't comfortable) He would go on with this for another 2 hours were he would tell me I know you like this , let me do it I will guide you and I would avoid it He would get sad cuz I didn't make out with him. He would say thats the way I show my affection. I told him like 2 times that I don't want to kiss cuz im not in the mood, im really tired and I felt it was too rushed. So, then it was like 12 am I told hik it was for him to leave cuz I needed tomorrow to wake up early cuz I was busy, he would tell him he won't unless I would kiss him which for him wws making out and when I did it fast he would get sad and say your teasing me huh and to do it go real. So, I went him to the front door he told me to kiss him if not he won't leave until I did. I was getting mote and mote uncomfortable.  So, I did it and he left. Then, I went upstairs to see my mom and she told me she felt anxious in a moment , so she went downstairs to check us cuz she heard alot of moving around and when she went she told me I looked weird cuz my hair was all over the place and the guy was acting weird. I told what happened qnd she said she wanted to about it with me tmrrow but ended up talking about it with me all night. Which, I told her I didn't fell ok and that I was disgusted which she consoled me and told next time he comes she would stay in the same room and I need to tell him nicely that I dont to rush which I told I already told him and he wasn't listening , she was like sad and told that if I wanted to continue seeing him. I was not really but at the same time , I don't to ghost him suddenly cuz he knows where I live. She got sadder cuz it was my first going on a date with someone. I told her also thatbhe mention that It's his first serious relationship and that he previous relationship weren't serious cuz he had his fuck boy phase. He told me also he felt insecured. Afterwards, I stated with her a little bit and I felt really uncomfortable,  a numbed feeling and my body was shaking a little bit. Afterwards,  I go to sleep, and woke up to a text which he told me yesterday was nice hehe and that he liked the kiss, I was like not french kiss tho and that I felt that things are going to fast. It's been 5 hours and he didn't he resond yet.

94,q03ssr,1633209922,My One Passed Away 6 Years Ago and I can't Date Again,"How should I get back into dating after my first love died:

I'm a 22 year old guy in college. When I was 11, I met a girl and we became ""special friends."" We were inseperatable. When we began maturing, we developed real romantic feelings and became girlfriend and boyfriend. It wasn't our hormones rushing, we genuinely loved each other. Even on school nights, we would be at each others houses helping with our homework and chores so we could cuddle and watch a movie. We were voted prom queen and king at our 8th grade dance.

When we were 16, she died suddenly. Her and some friends had been drinking, and one of them crashed a car they were in and she died. I had a rotten feeling that I couldn't explain, then her uncle called me and told me what happened. I felt like a part of me was buried with her.

6 years later, I'm ready to start dating again, but I can't seem to bring myself to it. I can't take the framed picture of us at our middle school prom off my desk. I just got into a relationship last July with a girl I liked, and after had what was supposedly ""the best S3x I \[my at the time new gf\] have ever had"" she has not pleased with the locket that used to belong to her, framed picture of us, her peppa pig toy, etc, the marinating attraction for her flipped off and the relationship ended soon after.

I never had sex with him anywhere near the point of when I began dating anyone new, but I do think about this now when I meet someone whose relationship ended in the past few months and if they haven't completely disengaged.
