I was talking to a guy for about a week. He invited me over to his place and we cuddled and watched a movie. And then I never heard from him again despite me reaching out to him. He didn’t explicitly say he was looking for a relationship so I think I was just an attempted booty call. Still got my feelings hurt even though I should’ve seen it coming. 

Then a couple weeks ago, I went out on a date with a guy. He kissed me at the end. And then nothing from him despite me texting him. 

And a couple days ago, in a moment of weakness and loneliness, I went over to another guys house for cuddles. I ended up staying the night. He said he was looking for a relationship. I said I was unsure of what I wanted because I was scared of being ghosted. And theeeen nothing from him despite me texting him asking him if he’d like to continue seeing each other and go on a date (because I felt like I gave him the wrong idea).

12,r02nl3,1637634701,How to reconnect after a bad date,"Hi Reddit, I'd like to ask for your advice.

I (f33) met a guy on Tinder, as cheesy as it sounds I felt an immediate connection with him (just based on his pics and bio, never happened to me). We were chatting a lot, shared many interests, opinions and pretty simillar sarcastic humor. We went on a first date, it wasn't great at the beginning but the longer we've talked the better it got. Afterwards was again a lots of texting, I really felt that we are a good match and have fun and a lot in common. On the second date, that went initially great, we decided to go to his place and try some drugs.

It was my first time so I didn't know what to expect, he was very nice and sweet the whole night and took an excellent care of me. I felt so good and comfortable with him altrough I knew I behaved strange as I really wasn't thinking (and behaving) like myself. We ended up cuddling and sleeping in the same bed, the morning after was amazing until out of the blue he rolled over and said that it's not what he wants and he's not happy like this. That he's 100% into me physically but I didn't care enough of him as he did.

You know, I'm not expecting to spend the life with him but I really liked him and I hate that he based this decision on the time while I wasn't really myself. Yes, I didn't care about him as much as I'd normally do because I was pretty high and had a hard time to handle myself and all the hallucinations and weird thoughts that went through my head, but we've talked all night, had deep (maybe 'deep') conversations, multiple times I asked him how he felt, what he was thinking about etc... Also he might be disappointed that I didn't take care of him sexually, but I'm that type that needs a moment to feel comfortable with a man physically.

I've read tons of 'how to get your ex back' articles, but as we didn't really have a relationship, I'm not sure what to do. I wanted to not contact him for a while, be fun and positive after but I wrote him after a several days because I experienced possible side effect of the drug and I panicked a little. We texted a bit, he seemed pretty caring and positive but my last message remained unanswered and no response since then (4 days). Also he mentioned something I said to him (a joke) on his social media and referred to me as 'one friend.' 

Trust me, I'm totally aware that I should let it go but I simply don't want to as I feel I was judged for a behavior that wasn't really mine. I see that his communications skills are not the best. But I don't expect anything, I don't feel desperate. I just want to give it the best possible try to reconnect and date again or to become friends. As I'm not very good in relationships - I'll be happy for any thought or advice and thanks for reading this!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r02nl3/how_to_reconnect_after_a_bad_date/

14,r02si3,1637635122,What am I supposed to think about my(23F) boyfriend's (29M) creepy hobby?,"So I've had this problem on my mind for a while. My boyfriend isn't the best or the worst boyfriend, yet I don't know what I would do without him. Yet there's this thing that disturbs me about him.

He and his discord friends have this role playing game where they all pretend to be magical half animal women who do sexual stuff and have very overly dramatic ""episodes"". They call it “Redhurst Academy” where they’re all wizards in training who go on adventures and what not. They added a twist to the game, and basically re-made it. My boyfriend, when he does a dramatic episode over the discord chat, he actually pretends to cry during an emotional ""scene"" and he gets emotional over it afterwards. When they're not playing games over voice chat, they're doing it in chat on their discord server. Which means that they send some of the most lewd and embarrassing things to each other. If I was caught dead saying some of the things they send, I couldn't live with myself.

It really creeps me out. In the past I just ignored it, saying that was his thing that made him happy. When he was deployed, it was this thing that's kept him from apparently killing himself. Whenever they would have their weekly “games” I would leave the apartment for the day because I couldn't stand to look at him afterwards. It was like he was a completely different person. I can't help but to think that this is the real him.

His roleplaying really makes him happy, and I can tell by the way he talks of how excited he gets. Yet, I'm not sure that I find him attractive thanks to this hobby of his. I've grown up in a family of boys who were into farming, cars, sports, etc. So getting to know my boyfriend more and more is a culture-shock.

Recently, he's been buying art online covering his character that he had commissioned. They're always really lewd and melodramatic. His most recent one is his spider-girl character sword fighting topless with her goat-girlfriend. Others include the two of them having sex in varying positions. I felt sick once after looking at a really graphic one.

Another thing is that my boyfriend writes smut about these two characters. To top it all off, its some of the worst writing comprehension I've ever read lol. This all wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that these are all grown men acting like girls engaging in sexual acts.

He's a good guy and all, but I'm in a mental state about it where I don't know what to think. It really disturbs me, but I don't want to break up because he is still such a good guy. What would you do?

tldr: My boyfriend plays a game with his friends that include pretending to be magical women having sex and going on adventures. It creeps me out, and I don't know what to think of it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r02si3/what_am_i_supposed_to_think_about_my23f/
15,r02uyc,1637635344,The toxic activity of girls when dating,"What a fucking joke today’s “relationships” are, and what makes it a joke is how complicated girls these days are. Before you say that im rude, just read this cuz believe me I’m speaking feom experience as a 20yo male, and most importantly you will never find a man talking about this anywhere. I mean just think about what i will say and criticize me if you want cuz i really dont give a fuck. 

Honestly, i cant stand how girls brains works, i mean how the fuck is a man supposed to build a relationship to last when the woman is playing toxic mind games, ghosting him for weeks, leaving him on delivered, cancelling dates on the last minute,  calling it “hard to get” type of bullshit, thinking that this adds up some fucking value to them, but instead it put the man in the most confusing place to ever be trying to find the missing part in this, analyzing what he’s done wrong when in reality, he’s done nothing but respect, love, and care about the women. 

Given that they(girls) showed us absolutely no effort, no interest in dating or knowing each other more personally, we(boys) find ourselves trying way harder than the other person. But as soon as we stop checking up on them and try to move on from this shit, even though we never stop caring about the person, all of a sudden, they come back and start talking to us like nothing ever happened. But then, when you tell the girl that you no longer want to continue dating and that you lost interest in her, guess who’s taking the blame? Yeah, of course the man takes the blame because for some fucking reason men are always supposed to be strong, responsible and always linked to every bad thing in our society, therefore, if a relationship fails, it’s always the man’s fault. 

For one reason or another, girls don’t like being treated well, they don’t like to be treated nicely. Whatever  a man do in order to keep the relationship going, thinking that it will make the girl happy, trust me, it won’t, its gonna blow back on him and only him, because in today’s society you care too much, “you’re weak”, you dont care enough, “you’re an asshole”, you talk too much, “you’re needy”, you don’t talk enough, “you’re awkward”, you compliment her, “you’re too nice”, and the list goes on… 

The sad part about all of this is that they know exactly what they are doing. All these mind games, the toxic activity, them being distant, them not texting you back, then not calling you back, them flaking on dates, flaking on hangouts, they know exactly what they’re doing, they’re just  trying to play with your emotions and try to get a reaction out of you. I don’t care how many times you’re fed into it, i don’t care how many times you’ve dealt with it. It stops now. I need you to remind yourself who the fuck you are. I need you to realise that they aren’t able to call you, they aren’t able to text you when they are available. I need you to realize that they aren’t able to hang out when it’s convenient for them. I don’t care how long have you been in a relationship with this person, i don’t care how long you’ve been dating this person, you do not deserve to be a second fucking option. If they treat you like a second option, then you leave them right where they stand because YOU DESERVE BETTER!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r02uyc/the_toxic_activity_of_girls_when_dating/

18,r03i8t,1637637376,How Do I Ask Him Out?,"I (19F) have a crush (21M), and I have had this little crush on him since August of this year. Now today I posted on a different Forum asking for advice about a recent fiasco involving him and my ""friend"" (She deleted him off my socials but that's not the point). Anyways, I received 2 comments total, and they're telling me that I should ask him out but with me being me, I tend to overthink EVERYTHING lol. So I want to give some background information on him and I.

I started following him on IG around July or August of this year, and let me tell you when I say everything about him just draws me in. I continued watching what he posts and around September was when I mustered up the courage to DM him since I'm really really shy. We had some small talk and then left it at that. Then in the middle of September, a fake account using my pictures was following him and he showed it to me and reported it for me since that account had me blocked. I expressed how embarrassing it was, and he said ""It's okay, it only happens to the cute girls."" and when he said that I turned bright red. However, that was the last time we talked in September, but I was still crushing on him. 

October comes in, and his band has shows lined up so I went to one on a Saturday, posted I was there and he said, ""Should've stopped and said hi."" and then I expressed that I was very shy and that I promised him next time that I would say hi next time. Coincidentally, he was going to be performing at the state fair I was going to that next weekend, and I didn't know he was performing until I initiated that plan. So I watched him perform at the state fair, went up to say hi, and then he said that he would be in the area if I wanted to hang with him. I unfortunately couldn't (really long explanation I won't get into) but we were in the same vicinity and I could just see from the corner of my eye him eyeing me. Later that night he DM'd me saying, ""Thank your for stopping by and saying hi :)"" and my heart melted. We didn't talk much after that because again I'm really shy and awkward. Now back to the whole fiasco, my ""friend"" deleted my messages between him, unfollowed him, and restricted him on my account, and now he has unfollowed my account because of what she did. I feel like if I follow him again, I'll look weird or an idiot because of this ""friend's"" actions.

So my questions are: Is he just being friendly or is he possibly into me? And if so, how do I work through this mess of what my ""friend"" left for me to clean up?

I really don't want to get in way over my head, and I really can't think of a way to explain to him what happened and confess that I like him and want to go on a date with him. Any advice is greatly appreciated :) Thank you for reading &lt;3",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r03i8t/how_do_i_ask_him_out/
19,r03o82,1637637909,Should I reach out to my ex after 3 years to get an answer ?,"3 years ago, I was dating this woman(35f) casually. We dated for almost a month. We hooked up the first day we met and I want to confirm that I didn't get her pregnant that day. 

She was playing with my thing which was leaking a bit of precum and when I put the condom on, she unintentionally touched my thing (with the condom, she had some precum on her fingers) and pushed it inside her. I wasn't hard, so it didn't go in much. But I am afraid that some precum might have gone inside her vag. I got stupid scared and wasn't able to perform. We then dated for another month (didn't hook up because she told me she was having unprotected sex with a couple of others). She didn't tell me that she was pregnant during that month. She also used to drink and smoke as usual. Does that mean that she wasn't pregnant and I am simply too worried ?

I have tried reaching out to her via text a couple of times to get that clarified - no response. I don't know if she deleted my number or was busy. I am afraid that I might not get the correct answer unless I call her and explicitly ask her if I got her pregnant given that there were other guys involved. 
Also, she makes little money and has asked her dates for money before. So, I don't want her to get any weird ideas with my call. Not saying she is bad.. I don't know her well enough to say she won't do it.

I am getting engaged in Jan and want to get this sorted one way or another (either deciding that I am overthinking or contacting her). 

What should I do? Am I being too paranoid?. Should I contact her directly and ask her this?. Should I contact her in a different way? . We dated casually, so we don't even know each other's full names. She might not even  remember who I am :/.

21,r041kc,1637639084,I realized tonight I love her.,"We've been dating for close to four months. It was the third date I realized how special my time was with her. Our first kiss had me feeling enamored in a way a first kiss hadn't before. My time spent with her quickly magical; I had no other passing thought when we were with each other. Her appreciation, gratitude, and comfort continue to leave me in a state of awe like I've never experienced.

Each of my previous relationships were doomed from the beginning. My first girlfriend was inconsistent, my second was abusive, and my third lacked the chemistry I was hoping for. This time, though, this girl keeps checking off all the boxes, needs, and wants I knew and didn't know I could experience.

Thinking of her brightens my day. Seeing her photos brings me peace. Spending my time with her alleviates any anxiety. It's just seamless and simple and easy. I had no idea it could be like this.

I remember the moment it first occurred to me I was falling for her. We were walking home with her roommates late at night and we'd stopped at a park. We stumbled over to the baseball infield, laid together, then looked at each other and kissed. In that moment, nothing else in the world churned. if I had the option, I would've laid there all night.

There's nothing else I want out of this year than to make the relationship official. Her current schedule has left her drowning and unable to make much time for anything besides herself. Coming to the conclusion that I love her has left me happy and sad. Sad, because I'm not sure when I'll get to see her next. Happy, because not once in my life have I felt this engrossed in a relationship. She's incredible.

This post is me getting it off my chest. Thanks for listening.

I still can’t get it off my mind though, mainly because I’ve never had a relationship before. And I know the longer this goes on and the longer I take to get myself dateable, the more of a red flag this becomes. 

So how do I stop wallowing in my singleness and accept this for the next probably 6 months?  I dont know why it’s even this big of a deal to me, I’ve gone 25 years like this.

Like when I say quickly I mean quickly. We talked almost every day, hung out a few times, and he would ask me to help him with his homework (usually writing papers for him) and I would do it, since he asked and told me how he's not used to going to school because this is his first year back at college since he's in the military and he's been deployed for the last couple of years. So yeah, I sound like an idiot writing his papers for him, but I honestly didn't mind it because I had nothing better to do. He began to get distant, and started posting about his 'gym crush' so I began thinking that he was basically using me for sex and homework. Every time we hung out he was always so mushy, sweet and absolutely dreamy in person, but he was talking about this 'gym crush' on his snapchat story and so I started becoming distant.

Flash forward to about four weeks ago, he had asked me to write a paper for him. It was a pretty detailed paper, and I also had a lot of my own school work to do, but I told him I would do it for him. I ended up completely forgetting, and the next day he asked why I didn't send the paper, and when I opened his message I began writing it, but when I looked back at my phone, he had blocked me on everything. I was really crushed because I had fallen head over heels for him, literally, he's all I can think about.

I ended up messaging him how I felt yesterday. I thought he would've blocked my number, but he didn't. I told him how sorry I was for not writing his paper, and that I fell for him so quickly that I was scared that he might think I'm trying to rush into things with him. He did respond, and we texted a few times more after that, in which he asked ""I just don't understand someone that distances themselves when all they want is me"" and I texted him this long paragraph, explaining that I didn't want him to think I'm weird because of how quickly I fell in love with him.

Is this a normal part of online dating nowadays..? 

I talked to my friends about this, and they thought he only wanted to hook up. So, I confronted him about his intentions because this “horny” vibe doesn’t do anything for me. He said he’s genuinely interested in seeing where this goes. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Honestly, I think sex is something too special and I don’t want it until I really believe that he and I have a great connection. I’m not the kind of girl who can brush it off as if sex doesn’t mean anything. But I’m terrible at dating and I’m slightly nervous that he’ll lose interest. If he continues to disrespect my feelings, should I keep accepting his apologies and wait until we meet? (Possibly this weekend) Or should I cut him off without seeing if there’s any chemistry in person?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r04caa/we_havent_met_and_hes_already_way_too_horny/
27,r04dwc,1637640188,Is this girl into me?,"The first time we met was when I was in class doing my work when she hugged me from behind and said that I'm her friend now out of nowhere despite us not talking to each other at all prior. I responded by putting my hand on her arm and she looked at me and smiled. We talked a little bit here and there, then covid hit, and we didn't talk for a couple of years. We meet again in high school, she approaches and strikes a conversation with me, we had a lot of small talk. We began talking a lot more when the teacher by chance put us right beside each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

She's a very strange and physical girl. She hugs me, pokes my nose, writes ""peepee"" on my schoolwork, pokes and grabs my hips to tickle me, cuddled with me, bites my fingers, and sucks my neck. I don't initiate conversations with her at all, and always wait for her to respond.  Like one time she told me she was going to kidnap me and bursted out laughing when I said she can kidnap me anytime she likes. I've made her laugh a lot more times after that with weird sayings. 

&amp;#x200B;

Later on, I show her my school picture and she said I have an adorable and cute face and takes the picture away from me. I asked her what's she's going to do with it, and she said she's going to keep it so she can look at it. Later, she told me her mom saw my picture and the mom said I was cute and said that she wanted me to date her daughter. This girl also talked to another person who sits next to us about how they talk about me a lot to their mom and told their mom I'm funny and say weird things.

&amp;#x200B;

We start texting and opening up to each other. She said she wanted to be my friend because she said she enjoys my company and likes talking to me, and that she'd try to find ways to sit next to me even if the teacher moved us. We also talked about how we're probably going to be separated eventually and I told her she'll be fine without me. She said ""I will not be. And I will not forget you.""

28,r04pxk,1637641280,I have only seen my GF for 45minutes in the last 14 days,"So I (25M) have been dating my (24F) girlfriend for nearly 5 years now. 

With our conflicting work schedules (she works overnight) I'm already sleeping when she comes home at 3am. I wake up at 6am, go to work and I don't get home until 5PM. At this point she is already at work as she works 12-hour shifts. 

So literally the only time we see each-other is for about 60 seconds when I talk to her as I kiss her goodbye when I leave for work in the morning. 

What somewhat upset me is that she recently got a 2nd job as a waitress (about 6-months ago). I fully respect her drive and motivation to work, but now with the 2nd job we don't get to see each-other anymore. At least before, we still had days off together. Now, she works 6 days a week and her only day off is during the week (I work M-F) and she typically sleeps all day as she works overnights.

Out of curiosity, I kept track of all the times we were physically awake next to each-other for the past two weeks. I counted a total 45 minutes...in 14 days! We live together and sleep in the same bed and I have only seen her for 45 minutes combined the last 2 weeks. 

I feel like I'm in a long-distance relationship.

I've tried explaining this to my GF and she doesn't seem to really want to hear my point of view. I asked her why she is working 2 jobs and she doesn't have an answer. I know it's not for the money because I pay for most of the bills. It's just making me upset that I don't even get to see her and I feel it's taking a toll on our relationship. I want to be able to come home and have dinner with her, not talk to her on FaceTime during her 30 minute break. I want to watch a movie together, or go to the store together.

1) Should my profiles state that i am not looking for a hookup? I'm cool with platonic relationships, and i eventually want to find someone to marry.

31,r04squ,1637641537,Sending initial text,"There’s this girl(R) at my university that I’ve recently became interested in. We know each other for about a year through an organization on campus that I help run. A few weeks ago it was my bday. R found out and asked if me and my friends were going out that night to the local bar as Thursday’s were college night. At first I wasn’t but since R asked I said why not. That night along with friends we all hung out and had a good time. Towards the end of night at an after party I was in a good conversation with R but then my buddy got a call and I had to help him deal with some other drama. After I got back, the party was dying out so everybody went home. That same week I was on bumble and got a notice of a recent like. Based on the blurred picture I knew which profile to look out for. As I swiped I came across it and it was R’s profile. I knew it would be a match if it I swiped. After getting some confidence I swiped and we matched. Since it was bumble, she had to message first. The next morning I received a message saying “hi”. I messaged back “hey, look at this” but then never received anything again. Later that weekend we both had a trip for my engineering organization that I help organized. We had a charter bus and I assumed she would want to sit with me and some friends that she knew. Since I was busy doing stuff for the trip I was last to get on the bus and sat in the spots my friends reserved in the front. My friend who she’s cool with asked her to come sit with us but never responded. We did the event and on the way back, while I passed out lunch, I saw her and asked if she wanted to come sit with us. She said she wanted to finish some show she was watching.  I was bummed out. Trip ended. Later on that week I messages he cause me and some friends were going home(where R is also from) for the weekend back for a local beer festival. I invited R and she said she would be in town as well so would possibly go. She genuinely seemed interested in going. As the weekend came closer I sent her more details on the time and where we were planning on meeting up. All seemed well even the morning of she asked what time. A few before meeting up she backed out saying she was tired from the drive. Ended up having a good time with friends but felt like it would of been a great time if R would have came. After that didn’t really receive any more communication for about two weeks. I’m at a point where I feel I’m making the effort but she isn’t.To me she’s too good to pass on but also know when it’s no longer worth an effort. I decided since we’ll both be home for thanksgiving break I wanna ask her to go out this weekend.

32,r04tlf,1637641616,Best way to meet people online for dating based on qualities/personalities rather than looks.,"For me, attractiveness in a partner is 99% what's on the inside and 1% of what's on the outside. I give zero fucks about appearance unless there's a really bad hygiene issue, severe deformity, or something of that nature. 

I've struggled bigtime meeting people in person, partly because I live in a semi-small town and partly because I have quite peculiar interests and hobbies. I've pretty much accepted that if I am going to meet someone it's going to be over the internet.

The only issue is that the majority of people put a substantial emphasis on physical appearance and pretty much every dating app caters to this. My dream would be an app where you match with people based on common interests, religion, etc (whatever your top criteria are) and then see pictures afterward. I hate to be judged by my looksand I hate judging people based on their looks. Unfortunately I don't think such a service exists. 

Is anyone aware of something like this or something similar? Or a different approach to non-appearance based matchmaking?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r04tlf/best_way_to_meet_people_online_for_dating_based/

I don’t think I’m bad overall, I have a good career, my own apartment, years of therapy has made me emotionally intelligent, etc. But I still can’t date right now because I need to get my depression under control, need to lose the weight I gained, and I need to redevelop my passions/hobbies. 

I still can’t get it off my mind though, mainly because I’ve never had a relationship. And I know the longer this goes on and the longer I take to get myself dateable, the more of a red flag this becomes. 

So how do I stop wallowing in my singleness and accept this for the next probably 6 months?  I dont know why it’s even this big of a deal to me, I’ve gone 25 years like this.

Hey so I asked this girl on Instagram messages if she would like to get to know each other more. She left me on read. (This was during the summer) 

A few months later she dms me saying that she was sorry for not getting back to me and it was unfair of her not to, but then tells me she just got out of a relationship.

I told her its ok and that I didn’t take anything personally. Also that I understand that she didn’t want to date anyone right because she isn’t in the right place to do so. 

She was saying that I’m glad I didn’t take it badly.

We kind of left it there, so she posted a meme about how she closes people out of her life before they get it in.

I replied to it in a funny way Then I asked her for her Snapchat. I put friendly in brackets next to it like this (friendly) 
Too which I respectfully asked her for it.

But she left it on read again.
(After Viewing all my Instagram stories)
A week later out of the blue she messages me that she felt uncomfortable with me asking for her Snapchat too which then made me very uncomfortable because I’m not that person who wants to make people uncomfortable especially women.

I’ve loads of girls who I flirt with all the time just for the fun in it. I mean no harm and they love it when I do it with them.

So I apologised to her for making her feel uncomfortable because that wasn’t my intention at all, which then made me slightly uncomfortable. But i asked her why did she leave it a week to respond? 
Too which she said that she said that she wasn’t interested in anything &amp; she said already told me that but doesn’t like it when people push when she already said no.

Again I said to her that I wasn’t going to be flirty or sleazy nor was I, but I just left her with telling her how attractive that she is &amp; that I like the love she has for her dog and that’s a very attractive quality in a girl.

Anyways we had a few slight dms back &amp; fourth since but they only last 3/4messages at most.

But as of now she still views my Instagram stories all the time. Practically being one of the first or almost first to do so.

Should I ask her straight out to way she felt like she had to apologise? Or do I just leave it and let everything go as it is.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r05373/instagram_dms_she_apologised_months_after_leaving/

I sent her a message the next day staying how much I enjoyed myself and how I thought going to that place would be fun. She sent back a somewhat generic response. I probably should have quit there.

I have never been in a relationship and honestly it's something that I really want. I am worried I'm socially falling behind. So if yall would be kind enough to help I have a list of questions based on my experience.

1. How do I make my intentions clear without being too forward 
I have often been in the I like you best as a friend situation, and not in the i just want him to stop bothering me way. While i enjoy having friends I do sometimes want more, I have been told its best to make my intentions clear in the beginning, however alot of the time I don't have romantic feelings until I know someone as a person as a friend. 

2. How can i communicate in an intresting manner? 
I personally struggle with digital communication like texting and facetime. Its something im trying to work on, but how do I not sound bland and generic. I feel like I am so much more interesting and personable in person. I also feel like this is a big part of dating today and i am just not good at it.

3. Is it ok to try and flirt with random people?
I feel like in a public place I'm never really sure what to do, I never understood how people just flirt with strangers. I dont want to make anyone uncomfortable or anything. 


4. Whats the difference between, having a crush, infatuation, or just thinking someone is cute?
I feel like when I like some one its always yeah I think I could see me dating them, is that really a crush? I have only ever once been in a situation where i was like wow i really really want to romantically be with you. I don't think this is a good question and i definitely dont think I worded it in the way I wanted to.

44,r05wiv,1637645323,Should I move on?,"Hey guys,

So following up on a previous post. Basically, this girl in my class who I’d say I’m pretty close to in the class, acts super friendly and vibes with me in person, but is a horrible texter. 

We had classes with each other twice last week. 

On Monday, she came up to sit with me while I was studying before class. We talked and chilled in class, then after I asked where she parked, and if she wanted to give me a ride to my car further away. We go in the car, and I’m just teasing her about having a basic white girl car and how it smelled like alc. we talk about med school plans, tastes in music, and at some point she asks me to help her get a volunteer position, since I just told her I got one. I just kinda laughed it off and said you’re so needy. She drops me off at my car, we say see ya and I leave it at that.

Wed in class, we have lab together and are partners in a group. Keep it straight forward in lab, I notice she’s kinda sick though and keeps going to the bathroom. After class, I tell her I parked on the other side of school and walk the opposite way. On a whim, as we leave the building on opposite sides, I happen to see her walking by herself to her car. I call out to her, and ask if she would be willing to give me a ride(another opportunity to talk to her alone). She says yeah, gives me some shit about parking so far, and we hop in. She tells me about how she has ovarian cysts (little personal), I teased her about her dinner plans(she likes to eat frozen food like every night), asked her if she called a volunteer place yet. She said she hadn’t, and I joked and said you should just ask your boyfriend to do it, to which she paused and said yeah. I told her I wanted to get nose and ear piercings cause I thought they look sexy, to which she admitted she is really attracted to guys with nose piercings. I asked her what she was up to this week, she said I’m not too busy I may go out but not sure yet. We talked about night life for a bit, before we pull up to my car. I tell her  I’ll hit you up this week, if you want to do something, to which she says “Yeah okay”. I hop out the car, feeing like a G.

Come Friday, I’m going out with my friends already, just send her a “Hey” text to feel the waters around 3pm. She never responds, so drunkenly around 930 I double text and say “did you die or something”. No response, so I proceeded to get hammered and flirt with girls at the bars.


Little sad about getting ghosted this morning, mostly because we are friends and she still ghosted. I don’t have class again with her till after thanksgiving, so when I see her and if she comes to sit with me, I was going to ignore her until she brings it up and say “Oh I’m sorry, I thought we were just ignoring each other”

I dated a girl in middle school for a year and then during my sophomore year of high school I dated someone for about a month, and both of those girls approached me rather than me approaching them because I didn’t have the mindset of wanting a girlfriend. But then a year after my last breakup I decided that I was going to actually TRY to get a girlfriend and I made a ton of mistakes that got me rejected and even put into the friend zone too lol, I also tried online dating too which did not at all work for me either and never did that again because of how worthless I think online dating is.
So yeah with that information aside, I love playing video games, doing let’s plays on YouTube, watching action movies, I’m also working on a video game myself right now and even plan to start my own studio sometime in the future too.
I’m also a geek too.
In terms of looks I have brown wavy short hair, blue eyes, 6 4 feet tall, broad shoulders, lean body, 17 size feet. And yeah.
Lastly I’m an introvert too but I will have good conversations with friends though when I see them.
So yeah with all of that aside, basically my plan is to get a girlfriend who shares a lot of the same interests as me because then we can do a lot of stuff together including playing video games, watching action movies, and some others because I feel like if I get into a relationship with someone who has none of the same interests that I do, the relationship just isn’t going to work out for me. And so I just think it’s best to be with someone who is much like me.
So yeah where exactly can I find these girls when I have a chance?
I feel like gamestores, and geek  conventions may be the best places.
However coffee shops, grocery stores, bars, ummm yeah how about no.
Also when I think I’ve spotted the right girl for me, how should I talk, flirt, and ask her out?
And not only those but how can I find out if she’s single or not without asking her?
Please give me your best advice.
And please don’t recommend me to try online either if it’s through an online game or a dating app because online just doesn’t do anything for me I feel like.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r0636g/give_me_your_best_dating_advice/

A couple days pass after finding this all and the topic of her ex came up because she has a kid w/ him. I snuck the question of: ""When did you officially end things with him?"" The answer I got was: ""I don't know"". She couldn't look me in the eyes. She looked away.

A week passes, she finally opens up on her own that she was still with him. BUT. Not sexually with him. When we started talking. She of course does not mention when she stopped being around him.

Since the start I've told her I am 100% open and honest. When she told me she was only seeing me, I told her I was seeing other women. She blurted out that she was too. Then said sorry, that it was a lie. Earlier that week was when she was with her ex at a bar.

We agreed to be responsibly open with each other. My gut is telling me that she's not being open with me. My gut is telling me that she's keeping things from me.

55,r06sac,1637648586,"I'm 25 years old and never dated, kissed a girl, and let alone held hands with one","This might be a little bit depressing post but I'll try my best to not make it into one. 

As the title says, I'm 25 years old male and I have never dated before. Throughout my teenage years, I had some serious family issues which resulted in my current mental health problems (I have a borderline personality disorder which makes it very difficult to maintain any kind of normal relationship). When I was in high school, I was just a very depressed and sad kid and I didn't know I had issues. This spanned into my early 20s and I was recently finally able to start getting treatments for it. 

However, this makes me wonder if I can ever properly date someone with what I have. I have no experience dating and because of my issue, it is incredibly difficult to develop trust (as in even if I try, it takes great deal for me to trust someone but then that trust can be broken at any given moment at a snap of a finger). I am skeptical if any girls would be willing to date someone with my burden even though I am getting treatment.

58,r06z7n,1637649320,My best friend fucked my fwb (what would you do?),"I’ve been in a fwb situation for around 6 months now. I knew that we weren’t compatible long term, but the sex was great. We had a conversation about “us” 1-2 months ago, and concluded that we should continue our fwb situation and not enter into a committed relationship. She told me she has strong feelings for me, but it’s okay for us to continue our current situation (I was probably in the wrong here, but always honest about my intentions. I’m not a player). We continued to see each other and hook up after that.

I learned last weekend that my best friend had sex with her. He ran into her and a friend late night at a bar. He initially wanted to fuck her friend, they somehow entered into discussions around a threesome, her friend left to talk to another guy, and my fwb was left with my best friend. My best friend was blacked out and apparently she initiated sex. She ordered a hotel room on his phone and they went back. He was pretty drunk and didn’t last too long before passing out. I know all of this because he told me the next day and apologized. This is his side of the story.

This is a complex situation because there are multiple variables: 

1) I did not see myself with her long term, and I wasn’t exactly monogamous. I had sex with another woman the night before. The fact that she had sex with another man doesn’t bother me at all. That’s not what this is about.

2) My best friend was wasted and he claims that he did not initiate anything. Knowing him, he was out of his mind lmao. He always blacks out when he parties. 

3) I’m convinced that my fwb was targeting me since I kind of shot her down when we talked about dating long term. I don’t know this for a fact. But either way that’s a dark move. 

4) My friend broke “guy code”. There’s a common understanding amongst guys that you don’t fool around with your friends sexual partners. It’s as simple as that. I would never hook up with a friend’s fwb or girlfriend (obviously). I don’t think I can look at him the same again. I lost my trust in him. 

I told my friend that we’re cool, but it would have been fucked up if we were dating. At first I didn’t have strong feeling about it, surprisingly. It’s been 3 days now and I feel like the more the time passes the more sus this situation is. As I said earlier, this is a complex situation and I don’t know how to feel. I just know that it’s weighing down on me and I feel like shit. I’m going to distance myself from him for a bit.

62,r07azd,1637650603,I am in an interracial relationship &amp; here are a couple of weird things that happened during times when my fiancée visits me in the USA.,"So I'm an Irish American woman &amp; my  fiancée is Indonesian Chinese American man.

We met in LA and our courtship was very long since it was not love at first sight but we fell in love gradually through time.

He eventually went back home to Indonesia because he was offered a good paying high position at work there, we were in a long distance relationship for two years until he proposed. I fell in love with Indonesia and decided to live here with him.

When we were still bf-gf and in a long distance relationship, when he regularly visits me in the US, here are a couple of weird things we have experienced:

\- We were visiting my relatives in Wyoming, we were peacefully eating at a fast food when this man was strangely eyeing us, approached our table and asked ""Hey, is this man bothering you?"" pointing to my boyfriend. We were confused and I said no, he's my boyfriend and that weird man looked shocked. he was speechless, stared at us for a good 1 minute then left.

\- In San Francisco we were in Chinatown and  3 random Asian women kept giving me nasty looks on the street when I am with my boyfriend.

\- On Facebook a former work colleague of mine (he's white) commented on me &amp; my boyfriend's picture: ""You are gonna waste your good genes if you start a family with him."". I unfriended and blocked him.

\- I was having a drinks with high school friends when this close guy friend of mine drunkenly said ""I bet if your boyfriend isn't Asian, you won't even like him. I know you. You love Koreanovelas, Kpop boybands, BTS, Anime and Asian culture. You are into Asian men."" I said that isn't true because all my exes are white and my boyfriend is the only Asian man I've been with. I also told him I was offended. Eventually my high school friend apologized and I forgave him.

So there. I wonder why is it that if people are in interracial relationships, some members of the opposite sex who's race is the same as your partner's and yours acts all weird, acts kind of insecure and hates the fact that you are with a person of another race?

Like, white men, please don't be insecure when you see white women who are with Asian guys.

White women, don't be insecure when you see white guys with Asian women.

Asian men, don't be insecure when you see Asian women with white guys.

Asian women, don't be insecure when you see Asian men with white women.

Same goes for Black people and Hispanic people.

Just because a white woman is with an Asian guy, does not mean she thinks less of white men and vice versa. 

Please do not hate the opposite sex of your own race.

You can't choose who you fall in love with or who is your person.

We are all humans regardless of our skin color, upbringing and culture.

In the future I hope humanity can improve.

P.S.

64,r07c9q,1637650747,Why is it attractive to have no thoughts? Or is it?,"I am Norwegian 5’10”, 30M and seem to have some sort of thoughtlessness syndrome - I have no internal monologue. I found that I can make strong eye contact with girls and not have any anxiety or worry whereas my friends often look away. I can stand in the middle of a socializing crowd and hold still with no need to do anything or talk to anyone. My friends are busy speaking to girls and I just stand with them the entire time saying nothing. Girls end up more attracted to me and initiating conversations with me instead. I have nothing to say to them really.

I was rated 5.5 on an objective TRM scale and subjectively 7 by a girl in same post. I was told I look like a yoga dude with mustache and long hair tied in a bun. I wear large old school circular glasses. I was told I look like I have a good penis.  I have had tons of girls approaching me. multiple girls invite me to stay with them for sexual relationships. They would buy me tickets to travel and see them. stranger girls would give me presents for no good reason. Waiters and receptionists pay more attention to me than friends.

I get that I can be attractive to girls, but I am not the most attractive guy. what part of it has to do with my thoughtless state of being? Seems girls get turned on when I just stare at them with a slight grin and say nothing. I was thinking maybe the lack of thought would lead to lack of anxiety and thus gurls would sense the energy.

We had been fighting a lot in the weeks before the break up sometimes it was me being a prick and sometimes her. A lot of the arguments came from are financial struggles do to Covid and both of our laziness. We both let ourselves go . The night of the breakup she was in the other room (we live in a two bedroom Apt) I sat down to eat after she cooked (we had said very little to each other that day) and I get a message from her saying I think it would be best if we broke up. I fell apart instantly and when I walked into the other room to ask why and she says it's the small things and when I ask to talk about it she turned me down. 

Early in are relationship we had agreed that if we broke up we would stay friends but, how she ended things made it hard. I felt unloved af I confronted her and all she could do was make the excuse I was scared of how'd you react. I said she got a worse reaction out of me by doing it over message when she and I were a room apart. I felt like she didn't care or didn't understand why it was wrong but I can forgive ya know but I can't forget how she made me feel. The next part only gets worse so we have a son together since the beginning of are relationship ( I'm a dog dad my son is a 3 year old German shepherd) he's always been a big part of us even though he's a handful I love him. She told me he's my dog again after I asked her to take him out the day after the breakup (we take turns but she hadn't taken him two times prior so she had to take him twice since I did) and she said no because of her legs hurt ( we argued a lot about that she said I didn't understand her pain and she's right but if you lay in bed all day with weak legs of course their going to start to hurt more) And me being ya know heart broken I said no you have to do it it's your turn then she hits me with he's your dog. It was like a punch to the heart and I got mad saying he's not just my dog he's ours and said some unkind words I don't quite remember. She now has left all responsibility for him on me and I honestly wanna leave this town to many good memories turned bad. ya know? I gotta figure out what to do with him because he's a sweetheart to me and her but meaner than a bull to everyone else. If I'm gonna leave and go stay with family for awhile he can't come with me and finding him a home is near impossible because of his problems but I love him he's had my back this whole breakup. I'm so scared I'm not gonna find him a home with people who have patience to help him and give him the training we never could.

Then we talked ya know after I went away for a few days to clear my head and I was hard headed to her because I guess she couldn't explain herself which kinda pissed me off cause I'd done nothing but think of what to say. I came back the next day to talk and apologize for being hard headed the day before. we sat down and watch a movie after talking. We tried communicating but she was so disconnected like she completely severed are bond like riping off a bandage. I sat up thinking about it all night when I got up I kinda just didn't want to do anything but I got up eventually to think about something good to cook for a breakup like healthy food. As I was looking I didn't realize I still had her Google on my phone and saw something in her search history. What to do on a first date and what questions to as? my heart sank and I remember my aunt saying maybe she is trying to pursue someone else. I didn't want to believe it I trusted her ya know we'd open are hearts to each other so I wanted to get a reaction to see if it was true. So I messaged her asking how was the first date? She said what and I wrote back nevermind. I waited to see if she would say something or maybe talk to me about it but all she did was walk in the room and say do you still have my account on your phone? Which I replied to yes but I'll take it off, her saying that in my mind gave me all the answers I needed and I asked her who it was she said no one (she told me the day before when I asked, if there was someone else? She said no there wasn't but, then why did she look that up? she also told me we'll see if we end up together again. Thinking about it now I felt like it was her way of saying if what I do doesn't work out I'll fall back on you) I got mad because one of her reasons for breaking up with me was because she wanted to work on herself but, how are you gonna work on yourself and start another relationship? So I got mad and she kept saying things that didn't make sense as we argued and I gave up and decided it was time for me to leave for the night. 

Now I'm sitting here alone thinking about all of it and I wanna blame myself but then I think about what she did get mad/sad I don't know what to do I know it's over but I'm so hung up on it I'm asking strangers for advice. I don't know what I need to hear or how to feel all I know is I'm hurting. I don't even know if I'm allowed to post this here. I guess my questions are. am I justified for being mad? Why did she end a three year relationship over text? How do I learn from this relationship? How do I move on?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r08ghd/im_going_through_a_breakup_and_need_some_advice/
82,r08m59,1637655856,Im getting tired of this,"So I‘ve been talking to a few girls recently. Met them irl and completely unexpected. The last girl I‘ve met was clearly into me. We‘ve been texting a bit back and forth until I asked her to go out sometime. We picked a date and kept on texting until eventually the day before the date came. Then, when I asked her If she liked to eat such and such food tomorrow, she just canceled the date. After that, we havent been talking and when we see each other irl, she just completely avoids me.. her whole demeanor just changed. When I asked her if she was doing that on purpose, she just denied it. Now, Im giving her the same energy back.

I know this can have a number of reasons and Im not particularly mad at her but I have to say this:

It hasn’t been the first time sth like this happens. I would say it happens rather regularly. Am I doing sth wrong? Im not trying to come across as too pushy or too needy when texting/talking but I always make sure the women Im talking to know that Im seeing them as potentially someone more than just a friend (I try to be a little flirty at times etc.)

84,r08omu,1637656137,I (M21) think I really need support. Got rejected in real life and dating apps were a disaster. Am I really too unatractive to date a girl?,"Hi,  I am a 21 year old male living in western Europe. I never had a    girlfriend, kissed, went on a date or had sex. It makes mee feel lonely    and depressed sometimes even thought I got a great family, good   friends,  a good job and I do things I love.

In    real life I only got rejected by girls or friend zoned, which already    hurt my self esteem. Now I really wanted to go and try and I made  some   accounts on multiple dating apps, because in real life I  absolutely do   not meet a single women. Honestly joining the apps was a  disaster.

I   barely got any  likes and in all the apps combinded I only got one   single match. And  she did not reply on the dating app nor on her insta   she had written  in her bio. I tried an app where you can actually send   text to girls  without being matched, because I do not get any matches at   all. I  messaged about 30 girls. 8 looked at my profile (you get   notified when  that happens) and they just ended the chat. 1 did text me   back, but  then she ignored me even when I could see she had been online   or she  was online (probably texting a more attractive guy) and the  other  21  girls just never replied to anything.....

I    asked friends and they told me I am not ugly, but I think they are   only  being nice to me. With my looks I cannot compete with all the   other  guys to get a date with a girl. I already basically lowered my   standards  to the point that I was texting and liking girls that I didnt   think  were attractive and even they just ignored or deleted me. I   honesly do  not think it would be possible to lower my standards much   more.

I  am planning to delete my   accounts again and just accept my faith. I am  unatractive to date so I   will never get a gilrfriend and I will be  forever alone. These dating   apps confirmed what I already thought. I got  so many help from  friends  improving my profile, but it did not even  help getting me one  date. I  HATE MYSELF. I cannot compete with other  guys so girls will  always  choose for the more attractive guy rather then  me.

I   think I am really a caring  and trustworthy person, but girls only go   for the outside. In 2-4 years  every girl on my age is settled with a   good looking guy and I am still  sitting alone in my apartment.

I really want support, because I feel worthless, hopeless and desperate. Feel free to send me a DM.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r08omu/i_m21_think_i_really_need_support_got_rejected_in/

87,r09kyy,1637659961,"I didn't think I'd get chance to date again, but I think it's going pretty well","I (25, f) was with my ex partner 'George' (28, m) for 3 years until a couple of months ago. I thought we were really settled, mortgage together, very integrated into each other's families, then he just told me out of the blue that he only saw me as a friend. The house went up for sale and I plan to move back to my hometown. It just felt like my whole life was coming apart. The idea of starting again was completely terrifying. What made it harder is still living in the same house until we complete on the sale.

The other week, I decided to making a dating profile. I wasn't quite sure exactly what I was looking for, it kind of felt like testing the waters a little. I was doing something I didn't think I was ever going to do again because I thought me and George would grow old together. I've also only had 3 first dates in my life and 2 turned into long-term relationships. 

I matched with 'Chris', (30,m). We had a lot of mutual friends due to a shared hobby/lifestyle and was actually from near where I'm from and had moved away like me. Chris had also just had a 3 year relationship ended and didn't want to jump straight into a new relationship, which I think suits me too. Very much in the same boat. I'd also like to mention that he's totally my type physically, and neither of my exs were in that category. We got chatting and really got on. We agreed to meet up on Wednesday, but then both got super impatient and decided to go out last night instead.

We met in a nice pub and had something to eat. Reality did meet expectations...and we ended up going back to his for a cup of tea. We ended up ending each other's dry spells...twice.

so far my feelings haven’t changed much, should i wait longer and hang out more with her? i don’t want to raise expectations and then essentially slam the door in her face.

91,r09t54,1637660971,Did she(f18) play me(m18) or is there still a “chance?”,"So this is a long story to get the main situation..

It all started in sophomore year of high school, she was the new kid in school and barely knew anyone. We never talked to each other, but we did have a class together. The reason why we started talking is she became friends with another girl I was friends with. The three of us went out for a small birthday celebration, that’s when we started talking more. 

Nothing really changed between us until halfway through senior year of high school. 

I came back to my school after leaving for that semester to take college courses and online high school classes. She was excited I came back, including a lot of other her and my friends. I got back on the school tennis team and started practicing again with my old teammates that didn’t graduate last year. I jokingly asked her to join the team and she said she would join with me. At the time, nothing really seemed special between me and her so I never really thought of us being in a “relationship.” When she joined and we started hanging out more, I started to like her more. We would always practice tennis outside of school every week and just have fun. After awhile, we started going to activities together and going to restaurants. 

This is where the story takes a turn.

After graduation, we had a lot of free time. Every week I went to her house and watched her favorite movies and shows. The first couple weeks were just me and her sitting there watching the tv and us talking. After a while, she started laying on me and touching me; which caught me off guard. Probably a month in, she was literally on me and and rapping her arms around my body. At one point, she literally grabbed my hand and put it on her ass. That night of the ass touching, we both went outside so she could say bye to me when I was leaving, and we did a 30-60 second tight hug, which was kinda awkward since I’m quite a bit taller than her. She also brought me around her family and her mom and dad loved me. Her dog also LOVED me, it was hilarious. She’s also in pageants and won the city last year and she was competing for state queen. I promised that I would go but something came up and it made it where I couldn’t see her preform. So I got her a small gift for what she did, and it was a cameo of one of her favorite actress’s congratulating her on what she did. When she saw it, she almost cried. 

After the gift, was when I gained up the courage to tell her my feelings. She did say that she cared also but since we were going to colleges that are pretty far apart from each other. Which I understood, I was in a long distance relationship at one point and it fell apart. So do you guys think I still have a chance or was she playing me in some small way? The thing that stings about it if she was playing me is that she seemed like the one. Whenever I tried to talk to other girls after her, I would grow disinterested with any other girl because they weren’t her. She was the perfect girl I was looking for; funny, smart; likes to play video games, same religious standpoint, and same political views. I know this is surface level but she is beautiful and she would always complain about her “assets” but I thought her body was perfect the way it was. I’m not a fan of girls having big “assets.”",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r09t54/did_shef18_play_mem18_or_is_there_still_a_chance/
92,r09ypy,1637661652,Girl I've been seeing writing with for a little over 3 months ghosts after 5th date,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize if my formatting is wrong and hard to read or my English is not on point; I'm not a native speaker and a first-time poster on Reddit, but a long-time lurker.

&amp;#x200B;

I (22M) have a chaotic night behind me after suddenly getting ghosted and might need some advice or input on what to do or how to cope with my current situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory:

At the end of my final year of high school, my girlfriend and I had a somewhat nasty breakup. We were immature teens back then. In hindsight, both sides could have handled the situation better; however, I tend to be very emotional. Since it was my first ""real"" love, I took a long time to get over that relationship. We were both really shy so we never did anything more than cuddle and feel each other up.

&amp;#x200B;

During my first year of Uni, I was not interested in relationships, basically worked on improving myself mentally and physically, and focused solely on my studies.

&amp;#x200B;

When I felt ready for a new relationship again, Covid-19 hit, all bars, clubs, and gyms closed down, and with lectures being online, I barely left my flat during these 2 years, hanging out with my usual friend group, not meeting new people.

&amp;#x200B;

During the past half-year, I was working on finishing my degree and moved to a big city for an internship and work. During that time, I realized that something was missing in my life, and I was not fulfilled by an endless cycle of work/uni, gym, and evenings of gaming with my friends. I was missing an intimate partner in my life, a person you can be close to and share nice evenings and moments with, that trusts you. However, when it comes to romantic relationships, I'm somewhat socially awkward, a late bloomer, and lack experience. In person, I am generally very shy, observing, and silent. Still, once I am familiar with a person, with close friends and family, I am bold and speak my mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

To improve my situation and advance in life, I figured I needed to gain said experience and first improve my confidence. To achieve that, I just thought I needed to start approaching strangers and girls I'm interested in in my daily life more often. 

&amp;#x200B;

Situation:

Into the picture comes this girl (22F) I met a while back while shopping. I hesitated at first but asked her for her number to take her out for coffee very boldly. At first, she was puzzled as she did not expect to be asked out that direct, but she liked the different approach than the usual few minutes of chatting first.

&amp;#x200B;

Over text, she was hesitant at first, postponing our date twice. Mentally I set the limit to 3 cancellations before I call it off by myself. But we kept on chatting, and eventually, we met on the 3rd try. It was the usual awkward first date. However, we got along very well and decided to follow up on that.

&amp;#x200B;

I was upfront that I was looking for a long-term relationship. I needed to be comfortable and emotionally close with the other person first before having sex. She seemed to have a lot more experience and said she doesn't make a big deal out of having sex. That didn't stop us from seeing each other. The following weeks we met 4 additional times, going out to several amazing places and got super touchy always, holding hands, her putting her legs over mine, us bumping into each other ""by accident,"" in the cinema she first leaned into me, then basically sat on me while we felt each other up. The tension was insane. It was clear that we were both really into each other. Most of the time, I reciprocated on her making a move.

&amp;#x200B;

On the most recent date, last Friday, we went to my place after. We ended up having sex, and she was surprised that it was my first time ever. She did not have a problem with that and she was very respectful and guiding(?).  There was definitely room for improvement, and I could have been more proactive in initiation and moves. Still, considering it was my first time, my performance was okay-ish. 

&amp;#x200B;

When she got home that evening, she assured me it was an average performance and that first times aren't always as we imagine; one has to do it a few times to get into the ""flow."" However, we kept talking the following days, and we're already making plans on meeting up once more on the upcoming Thursday before I leave town for 2 weeks this Friday (her proposal actually).

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I say ""we were making plans"" cuz it appears that she cut me off in the middle of our conversation, blocking me. Her Picture on Whatsapp disappeared, and she unfollowed me and removed me from her follower list on Instagram; her profile doesn't show up anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last few messages are her saying that she might be free on Thursday and she would love to see me again before I leave. 

I answered that I'd love that too, and I might also be free on Thursday, but I'll know tomorrow for sure. 

She then responded that we could go to my place a bit earlier this time. 

I answered that we should definitely do that this time and we should talk about it tomorrow when we know more details about our time schedules. 

\&gt;End of chat&lt; \*ghosted\*

&amp;#x200B;

Clearly, she does not want anything to do with me anymore, but it caught me super off-guard. And since nothing in our chat pointed towards this, it hit me like a truck. When I realized I was devastated, we were already making plans to meet up again, planned on going on Christmas markets in December, etc. I thought we were on the same wavelength where this was going, and I could not sleep at all last night because of the abrupt ending. I was super careful not to get clingy or develop any kind of feelings until I received clear signals from her.

&amp;#x200B;

During the night, I was an emotional wreck but cooled down a bit by now. I have not slept at all, typing this out at the office right now. On the one hand, I got laid, so there's that - on the other, I always wanted to share my first time with a partner I have at least (some) future and can be close with. I feel used, played, and purposely led on just for sex.

&amp;#x200B;

It is a shitty feeling and it feels pointless to potentially go through that stress and drama over and over again until I find a person I get along with perfectly.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I deserve some closure, or at least tell her that it hurt me, and it is super cowardly on her part, especially not even giving a reason or sending a text. I was being transparent and fair about my intentions from the start. I feel like someone pulled the rug from below my feet, what I thought I had did not exist. My gut is telling me to just get over it and ignore it, let alone for self-respecting reasons.
