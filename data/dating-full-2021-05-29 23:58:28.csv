During the video call, she didn’t really put any effort in her appearance. No make up, she was cleaning her room, and folding laundry. We were talking for 30 minutes.

At the end when we spoke about the upcoming date, we originally planned to go to a cake shop for desert and afterwards stroll on the boardwalk. It turned out to be raining that day so I mentioned hibachi which she said she doesn’t like. She asked what’s wrong with getting dessert anyway. I said that without the boardwalk, it’ll be a pretty short. She said that will be good in case it’s awkward and uncomfortable and laughed, saying she cracks herself up.

I thought that was a bit of a weird joke. Like there was some truth to it. Maybe she feels stuck and uninterested. I’m interested and I made sure I looked presentable for our FaceTime call. She didn’t. Her joke also makes me feel like we’ll go out but it’ll be a waste of money and time.

I prefer a more consistent daily flowing conversation and can keep up or guide the convo as needed. But the person I’m talking to doesn’t initiate too much or depending on day etc doesn’t reply too much, not their fault of course, busy day and such. Before people say it’s because there’s no interest, we do have plans made and stuff but just the in between time, I like keeping a convo going.

I'm sorry to disturb y'all, I am making this post to vent a little ...   


I just had one of the most intense anxiety attack, or at least the one that made me crying the most ever.   


I think i'm bad at love. I may even have a romantical disability I don't know anymore what's wrong and why it's so hard for me to be ""successful in love"".   


I'm 22 years old and I never had a girlfriend ever, despite falling in love something like eleven time. eleven is no big deal, I know, but I am so sensitive it broke my hearts every time. Of course it hurts a lot but I always get confident after some month (years sometimes) and I jump into love head on again.   


I don't think of myself as a bad dude (according to the DnD alignment test i'm more like loyal good aha), I try my best to be good and kind, doing my life without hurting other's. In love i often see myself as a very romantic person, and even if I never tried I think I would be somebody very passionate and cuddly, or something like that.   


But, sadly I never found love. My heartbreaks made me go deeper into an overwhelming feel of loneliness, sadness, being unloved and unlovable (even if I know it's not true), and it made me also very anxious about love.   


I usually fell pretty fast in love, and that's one point. I think this make the whole seduction process unbalanced. I'm more into the girl that she is in me (never saw an inch of interest in a girl tho) and that may make things difficult.   


After another hard heartbreak in the end of 2020, I decided to let myself another chance not so long ago, and I allowed my heart to love again. The girl i'm in love is like so sweet, so kind, so adorable and we share many common interest. I thought that the odds were pretty good, because we both loved the same video games so I could found excuses to spend time with her and maybe start something in her heart too.   


But that got expectedly (considering my overwhelming anxiety) more difficult. Firstly she is kind with a lot of people  which makes it difficult to check if she's interested in me (I know she is single btw). Secondly she prefer not to talk with people in private (only with a very few people). Thirdly she dosen't let people got close to her easily ...   


I am trying to see if she ever gets confortable with me, but I'm not sure at all. I can see that she likes me, but this is hard because I know she need time to be confortable.   


And there is a guy on the same discord. They know eachother since sometimes, and they are close, like really close. Like she initiate the conversation with him and she talk to him about everything and nothing (i don't know the content of their conversations of course). She wants to talk to him. I don't know if they are interested in eachothers or if this just one of the two, but that triggers my anxiety like fire.   


I feel like the whole thing is slipping through my finger and I can't hold it, I don't know what to do. There is nothing that proves me that they are interested in eachother in a romantic way, but i'm just dumb and I have this creeping jealousy that make me feel terrible.   


I feel like I just fell in love with a girl, right before her heart is taken by somebody else. And I feel so bad, I feel guilty because I want her to be happy and I'd rather let her with somebody she loves, but my heart scream to death that it want her. I'm teared appart by those contardictory emotions, I don't know what to do ...   


I feel like I will never know this feeling. That my issues are to great and prevent me to do anything of the sort. That I will never feel the warmth of a cuddle, the softness of a kiss, the confort of being stared at with loving eyes ... Why do all those things sounds like unreal things to me ? I don't know what to do, i'm lost in all of this ...

He also has reframed our brief interaction to say I pursued him. Meanwhile I had thought it was mutual. He keeps talking about me to people and it’s like extremely embarrassing at this point.

Anyways tho. Part of me thinks it’s really dumb why he is going out of his way to treat me this way after he rejected me. Like he could just like move on and leave me alone. He could be KIND. How can he not know that he’s adding insult to injury ? I’m so humiliated by the fact that he told ppl I chased him and basically was obsessed. I feel like I can’t even talk about it bc then it would only confirm that I’m “obsessed”.

I had been pretty much keeping my distance because I didn't wanna be a creepo or try hard, though I could notice her looking my way, or if I'd be in the area she was training someone, she'd play with her hair a lot (an attempt to get me to notice)  


She happened to be training a former neighbor of mine and we talked for a bit and I dropped that I did photography for a living and the trainer goes ""You do photography? I do too!"" and talked for a bit, kept it short and went about my workout.  


Got her insta, followed her and she's been liking almost everything I've been posting lately, but when I see her at the gym I simply nod, or even just leave her alone cus she's training clients and plus has a ton of guys already talking to her -- I've learned not to be that guy who chases, but the one who doesn't to leave some mystery.  


The other day I was grabbing my water bottle to drink mid set, she's at the training desk and happens to walk by, I've got my earphones in, I decide to give her a fist bump -- but rather as a ploy to make her think I've friendzoned her. Then went about my workout.  


Today, I walked in, she hadn't been there for maybe 4-5 days, but as I walked in she walked by me and gave me a bit of a sly look, like a slight head tilt, no communication and I gave her a wink and went about my workout.  


I could get the feeling she looked my way maybe once or twice. I was walking back to get in a final stretch and she just happen to get off her shift, I threw her a ""peace"" sign like ""cya"" and then she goes ""Hey, how are you?"" almost like surprised. So I say, ""Good, you? Okay well, bye"" and I left.  


I have the slightest inclination that she knows what I'm doing, but might be doing it back to me -- thing is, she's young, so I'm maybe mistaking friendliness here? Or she's intimidated?

1. Online opinions are completely different from IRL opinions.

3. I also feel lots of you with problems are aware of what the problem is and just don't want to fix it, nor want reassurance that it's not *really* a problem. It's probably you, not the and i think you know that.

4. Facts are not acknowledged on this sub, and therefor all advice is not that helpful or correct. People will often tell you what you want to hear or be extra supportive just because.

5. Nothing and I mean NOTHING is accomplished through r/dating, you have to actually change and apply the solutions to your problems which I think most of us have no intention of doing

“Here's a rough guide of how much of your emotions you should invest in different dating scenarios.

•	⁠Before the first date: 0%
•	⁠First date: 0%
•	⁠Second date: 5%
•	⁠Third date: 10%
•	⁠7 dates: 25%
•	⁠Dating for 3 months: 50%
•	⁠Dating for 6 months: 75%
•	⁠Dating for 1 year: 90%
•	⁠Dating for 2 years: 100%

The emotional investment should somewhat match the likelihood that things will work out. During a first date, things are way too uncertain to invest any romantic emotions at all.” 


While I know the numbers are rough estimates and every situation is different, I find myself going over and my goal is to really just lessen my emotional investment. As for what happened, I went on 3 long dates with someone (totaling 17 hours) - obviously we had a really good time and enjoyed each other’s company. We both thought we were on the same page about not wanting anything seriously, but after the 4th date, he clarifies that he’s not looking for any commitment *at all*. Up until then, we had been talking constantly for weeks and meeting up every week (this is what I usually think of when casual dating is going well). Now he’s taken a step back and just wants to be able to just focus on himself, take it easy, and if things line up then we meet. 

I respect that he knows he needs to work on himself and heal from a toxic relationship and I’m at a point where I don’t feel I need a serious relationship nor am I dating with the intention of getting serious (but I’m not against it if it happens later on). Obviously I’m pretty disappointed - I really felt like we clicked extremely well on top of physical attraction and it went both ways. In fact, normally dislike physical touch and affection but really enjoyed giving/receiving with him. After finding out, I’ve been lessening my hopes and expectations towards him but realized that I had probably 25%-40% emotional invested when I should’ve had less. 

I know I have anxious attachment style and have gotten better with it over the past few years through therapy, but I’d really love some reminders/tips/encouragement on how I can avoid investing too much too early and save myself extra disappointment moving forward.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,804347,public,self,I (early 20s) want to work on myself too after what happened.

About two weeks ago she slept over and when we were going outside to get some food to cook at home her phone locked itself and said ""wrong password was put in to many times"" she didn't question me but I obviously knew she thought I tried to unlock her phone.

Fast forward to yesterday and she comes over and we get intimate.  Around this time she had gone to the bathroom and I was just laying in bed. When she comes back she checks her phone and it was unlocked and she asks me if I've been trying to enter her phone for these past two weeks.

I haven't. And I can see why thinks I have tried cause it really does point to me. The big problem with this is it makes me question if she is hiding something and I should be concerned. Do you think she is or is this all in my head?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,804380,public,self,Should I be worried?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/no28ei/should_i_be_worried/,all_ads,6,,,,,

I’ve dated the narcissists, abusers, manipulators, and everything in between. 
And I really want to share a moment with you today, with my current boyfriend of close to 2 years, that really voiced to me that this is finally what I deserve. What I have longed for. What I am worthy of. 

For my entire life I have been in a toxic household growing up. My mother has been very emotionally abusive to me. To where as an adult today, I still struggle with my self worth in lots of ways. I finally found a way to move out now, to get away from this environment for myself. However, I cannot bring my cat with me until after I finish college. My baby. My comfort animal I confided in for 8 years through all of the absolute he** I went through. For a major part of my life, she is all I had. I would scream and cry to her, not understanding why I was dealing with the things I was dealing with. She is also equally as attachment to me. 

When things began setting in my mind that I would have to be leaving this piece of myself for a while, I began to get really emotional. I felt horrible, I felt guilty. Even though I knew deep down this was best for me. And that if she was a human, she would understand. And that I will be back soon. 

My boyfriend listened to me. Sympathized with me. He Understood how much she meant to me. And as a complete surprise, invested in several ceramic planters that look exactly like my animal, to have a peace of her with me. I cried on my way home from receiving this gift.

I’m not sure whether it was on me or if she was just a bad kisser but it wasn’t really all that enjoyable. She has her mouth open too wide and then she randomly switched sides on me not too far in to the kiss which caught me off guard. 

Afterwards, we were both at a little bit of a loss of words as to what to say next. I could tell by her body language she didn’t enjoy it and was trying to get out as soon as possible. To comfort the situation, I made a joke about her leaving her purse in which she laughed but maybe more just out of politeness.

Then he comes back with “how are you? So sorry, there was a death in the family...”. 🙄  I told him coma woulda been a better excuse, bye.

I'm technically using them for non-romantic reasons, so I hope this post will be allowed. I thought I could be less picky since I'm not looking for anything too serious. I don't want to ghost non-terrible people, but I'm really starting to get frustrated. Here are some things I'm wondering if they should be dealbreakers:

* Catfishing: I'm not trying to be superficial, but this guy I was chatting with sent me more photos, and it became clear that he looks like a junior magician and tried to hide his bald spot. Tbh I genuinely don't judge people harshly based on appearance, but I'm pretty annoyed about being purposefully misled. I assume he knows, because the photos on his profile and the ones he sent are completely different.
* Bad at scheduling/rescheduling: I have people that I'm down to meet, but they'll tell me they're free ""this weekend"" and then wont seal the deal. I want to give benefit of the doubt, but it's pretty annoying to me. How many times is it reasonable to nudge them? How many times is it reasonable for something to come up?
* Bad at small talk but constantly wants to chat: Guys who message good morning, hi, etc, but give really short responses and expect me to carry the conversation. I personally do not like small talk and find it really annoying esp since they started the convo, but is it petty to make this a dealbreaker?

Additionally, is it terrible to just disconnect with someone you've been talking to for a while? There are people who send me racist/misogynistic messages, and I'll cut them off right away. There are also people who seem nice, but we just don't have chemistry, and I'll just be honest with them and tell them we aren't a good match. What about people in this grey area? Should I give them an explanation? Some of these people I have been talking to on and off for 2+ weeks, waiting for their schedules to work out.

We are exclusive and do boyfriend/girlfriend stuff often spending 3-4 nights a week with each other. I have stated before I do not want a bf at this time, but I obviously do enjoy his company, have developed some feelings and could see myself dating him in the future. He has expressed he likes me as well and has always been honest/kind. We do not see or talk to other people, frequently talk everyday, and it essentially feels like relationship behavior.
However, he has been less than forthcoming about his emotions towards me. He has stated he is unsure about dating. I find out tonight he said he realized he did not see a romantic future with us (i.e. dating) since our second date. Furthermore he expressed that he can’t end it every time he has tried to as he is so confused by his feelings for me. He states he cares about me and likes me, but to be quite frank I don’t think withholding this kind of information, especially when i have been forthcoming with my own emotions, represents this.

I had initially approached this situation with a lets see what happens mindset. However, I feel the fact I have started genuinely caring about this person are making me question his intentions and if I am even ok with continuing. I have never been in a “situationship” before, so I am unsure how to proceed.

I just got into a relationship with this girl I've known for a while now. We've known each other during high school but only really started to talk during the last half of the final year. I've always liked this girl but she's never shown a single sign that she was interested. Keep in mind, I'm a little bit introverted in general but she's probably more so than me, so I had to put in the most effort to even talk to her in school as she was very quiet all the time. It generally stayed 100% platonic up until now. We've also gone out irl a few times but never acknowledged them as dates.

Because the Covid cases were rising rapidly in my country, we both started calling since we couldn't go out for a long while due to lockdown. She then came out to me first on-call saying she always liked me but was terrified to make a move on me. We both confessed and things were going along smoothly for a while. (FYI, we've never been in a relationship before, so this is a first for both of us.) Anyways, ever since that confession, our calls and texts have gone from close to every day to little to nothing for about a week as well as being dryer than the Sahara Desert (it's only been a week since we confessed).

Obviously, I want to keep this relationship afloat, so I start every convo or hitting her up every so often, but recently she's been a bit dry for no apparent reason. I try my best to give her enough space but I thought communication in a relationship is the most important thing? She NEVER hits me up first or ANYTHING. And the thing is, she said to me herself that she too will put in effort into the relationship, and that she cares about me. I kinda feel like I'm overthinking this too much since this is only the first week, she probably feels a little awkward about this whole thing too as it's her first time, but I would appreciate if she puts in at least a little bit of effort instead of none :(

I’m new to reddit hope i’m doing this right! My birthday just passed a week ago and I decided to celebrate the day with my bf (22) instead of with my friends because we are still in covid lockdown and only one visitor is allowed in the house. 

I was really excited and I was ready to pick him up from the bus stop, when I did, we hugged and while walking, I realised he had nothing in his hand. This made me a bit confused because we always exchanged gifts on occasions. He said he’s sorry because he didn’t know what to get me. 

I think it’s a very lame excuse (receiving gifts is also second in my love language after words of affirmation) but I was thinking he might do something special for me later. It can be super simple like making me pancakes but to my disappointment, he didn’t. 

We got home, i had a lot of food prepared and we both ate. We planned to visit the theme park later in the afternoon so while watching a movie (which he chose and i told him i didn’t enjoy this sort of genre but he watched it anyways) he kept asking me about the timing schedule or how long it’ll take to reach the theme park. The park was pretty far, about an hour train ride but i told him from the station. But he soon lost his cool and asked me “yeah so how much time  is it in total?” 

I was confused, was he referring to how much time we needed to walk to the station? I was pretty pissed he couldn’t well check it himself and expected me to do everything. I then told him “check it yourself” and I think he wasn’t happy with my tone. 

It resulted to a 3 hour silent treatment from me and he asked me what’s wrong? I told him and he was pretty stressed out saying “if you don’t tell me how would i know?” 
the situation was bad and he seemed cold so i left and cried silently in the toilet. 

But at the theme park (which i paid for him and me too), we had fun at the end of the day. 

In conclusion, he’s usually a gentleman, he’s handsome, tall, polite and likeable but I find that we both have NOTHING in common and my feelings for him goes up and down a lot. We been together for 2 years and I find it tiring I’m the one always paying when WE AGREED TO SPLIT THE BILL throughout our relationship. But that day was my birthday and tbh it was the worst birthday. 

Now, I’m thinking of breaking up because I don’t find us compatible.
