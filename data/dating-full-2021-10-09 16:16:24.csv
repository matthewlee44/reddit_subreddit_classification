I'm 35, male, and a widower with 3 young children. I don't wan to give details about my wife's passings, but for context she passed from cancer. 

It's been 2 years now and I haven't dated at all, I've just focused on work and supporting my children. I  have had it in the back of my mind for the last year though, knowing eventually I'd feel ready again, and she would want that for me. So I've also been taking care of myself very well for this past year as well. Not just to be in shape for dating, but also because I want to be healthy for my children. I'm healthy and fit mentally and physically and I'm finally feeling like I have some control over my life again.

Because of this I've also decided I'm ready to put myself back out there, and I've signed up for bumble but haven't actually used it yet or flushed out my profile.

But now I find myself hesitating, because honestly I'm not sure who would want someone with all this baggage. Plus, it seems many women in their 30's who are still single are hoping for children of their own, and I don't want any more children. 3 is enough, I love my kids, they are my whole world, but financially speaking I know I can securely provide for 3 and worry that any more would be difficult to support, especially if I lost another partner somehow or my future partner lost me somehow. Also there is the factor of age, I just feel too old to have another baby now, not to mention if I date a woman it would likely be a few years before we even approach that topic, and at that point I'd be pushing 40. 

Sorry, I feel like I'm rambling. I suppose I'm just feeling hopeless here. Would women really want a widower with 3 young kids? Who doesn't want any more kids?

I’m a 30 year old female single mom out in the dating world. Long story short, I had someone over on Monday night I’d never met. We had talked plenty of times before and after a few glasses of wine on a whim, I invited him over. 

We had an incredible time. He is exactly my type and also was not shy about anything in his life. I am a very outspoken, unfiltered, eccentric person and he made me feel more comfortable by telling me his outlandish upbringing. We seemed to have an instant connection, both physically and mentally. He said he was only going to stay an hour as he had to work the next morning but again- he did not expect anything, pressure anything, make any crazy advances. He was super affectionate though, but I am also the same so it was very refreshing. 

We laughed ALL. FREAKING. NIGHT. I have an… interesting personality and sense of humor and he matched it crazily. He opened up about his family life, etc. We were both on the same page about sleeping on the first date together- if it happens it happens, but there had to be a connection and we’re both consenting adults. Why does sleeping with someone on the first date mean you’re not serious about someone, etc. He told me countless times how dope I was, how beautiful I was, how much he really liked me. He would just look at me with googly eyes and be like “god you’re just so cute.” etc. 

Needless to say he spent the night. We did sleep together, but it felt okay, not awkward or anything. He left the next morning on great terms. It’s been almost a week and he has completely ghosted me. I’m so confused? He pursued me on hinge haha and he said ALL night how great of a time he was having. What the frick?

Tldr; got ghosted by someone who pursued me, but our date was so awesome and told me all night long how much he was enjoying himself and how much he liked me.

Another thing I noticed is that she lets me know whenever a guy hits on her, so idk if she’s trying to make me jealous as part of her being interested, or just being shallow and trying to show off. Knowing her, I don’t think it’s the latter but also can’t say it’s the former of the gut feeling I mentioned (could just be small talk, idk).

A lot of being attracted and in love with people comes down to physical attraction and sexual chemistry and enjoyment of each other’s bodies. I know people always say: well everyone grows old and wrinkly, which is true, but also, most relationships fall off when the sex starts to die off. I’ve known many long term relationships where this is the case. We always say that personalities are what counts, and while of course emotional chemistry and personality is definitely extremely important, I think we underestimate how important physical intimacy and desire is for the love with our partners to keep going. If you have to wake up every day next to this person or spend time with them, a true desire for wanting to touch and kiss and have sex with them and be turned on by them still has to be strong. This also goes with people becoming much less attractive as they don’t keep up with the health of their own bodies as they age, so people fall out of love because they find the physical component to be not interesting anymore. I also believe it’s not really even a shallow thing. We as humans are attracted to what we like to look at, and to be honest, the relationships I’ve been in that were the longest and strongest were with people I was incredibly physically and sexually attracted to. Otherwise, I just didn’t even want to have sex with people after a while, and I stopped even feeling any remote physical attraction to them whatsoever, even though I still liked their personality, it felt almost more just like a friend than a lover or romantic partner.

I'm a girl. We had been talking about school stuff for months and he was like ""hey do you want to grab lunch?"" 
I had to decline because I had other stuff planned but promised to get back to him later.

A couple of weeks later I asked him to play golf with me and he was like sure. We played golf for an hour and so and then he invited me to his friends place to meet his friends. They were friendly.

I had fun etc and time went by when a week later I asked him to go on a walk with me in the evening, it was like 7 pm. And he was yeah, answered very fast and all. We went on a walk for an hour and just talked, it was flowing so good and never felt stale or awkward.

A couple of weeks later we went out for drinks and pool. Before I arrived he sent a snap, a selfie of himself with tons of heart emojis. I just thought it was a joke so I didn't think much about it. 

And then two weeks ago he sent me a text telling me to come to a student bar that he works at. I went there and saw him in the bar and we talked a lot and I held him company for a while before I went to a table and talked to some students rest of the night. He texted me and was like ""where did you go?"" And I answered I was at a table with some students.

When the bar was closing and I was going out, Kind of drunk, I saw him, he approached me and put his arm around me and was like go home you're drunk which was funny.

And then the day after, kind of late, it was 11 PM, he texts me again telling me to come to the bar again. I was sleeping so didn't see the text until the morning after so I couldn't come. The week afterwards I asked him if he wanted to hang with me and a friend at the bar. He was like probably if I'm not busy. However some things came up so I had to decline the whole thing unfortunately.

I'm going to a festival soon, and he asked me a couple of days ago if I was going. I was like yeah. He then asked if I could get him tickets (the process of getting tickets is kind of lengthy) and I'm like sure I can try. And he was like thanks ❤️

These are things I've actively changed in the past 2 years that significantly helped me, and why: 

* Get a workout regime

This advice gets thrown around often, and it's good advice. But people often discount it as bad advice because of the expectation. Working out and/or getting fit or ripped will not suddenly mean a plethora of high quality, attractive dating prospects will come knocking on your door with no additional effort on your part. 

The reason working out regularly is key is because it requires discipline, and often that discipline can transfer over to other areas of your life including dating. On top of that, it gives you a 'rush' that is actually healthy, instead of one caused by drinking/drugs/eating bad food etc. It also increases confidence and the obvious, increases physical appearance. 

* Get therapy 

Many people want to skip over this step, when in reality it's the most important one. Choosing a compatible therapist is just as important as choosing a compatible partner. If you can't afford therapy, there are tons of self-help books, online PDFs, self-improvement goals, etc for free. While I don't think anything can replace actual therapy, if it's not accessible to you something is  better than nothing.

People are walking around thinking they're healed, when they are not. Issues from your childhood, early friendships, prior relationships, attachment styles etc WILL often come up later in your relationships. It's absolutely critical to dive deep into yourself and heal prior baggage. You don't need to be completely ""fixed"" (no one is) before getting into a relationship, but you need to be willing to take some accountability for decisions you make and how they affect your outcomes.

I also think couples therapy is very beneficial, even if everything in your relationship is solid. The best time to work on potential issues is before they happen. 

* Understand that the places/spaces you put yourself in (or don't) contribute to your perception

Some people consistently go out drinking every weekend, predominantly meet others at bars/clubs/parties or on apps, and then wonder why they're only getting superficial, fleeting connections.

That's not to say relationships can't come from those spaces, but IMO it's the exception and not the rule. That's also not to say you can't use those spaces as a tool to meet more people and increase the probability of finding someone, but I do think you need to adjust your expectations based on the spaces you're looking. Spaces that are based upon superficiality, ""paradox of choice"" and disposability culture will have a significantly higher % (maybe 95%+) of flakes, fakes, ghosts, cheaters, misleaders, pump and dumps, foodie dates, etc. 

* You are what you attract (usually) and you get what you value (usually) 

What people say they want and who they choose often paints two different pictures. This applies to both men and women even though both genders like to point fingers.

As hard as it is sometimes to take accountability, that's exactly what you have to do. If you only attract people who are emotionally unavailable, it's probably because you're also emotionally unavailable. If you only attract people who are shallow, it's likely because you're shallow as well (and disregard character/integrity so long as the person's hot enough).

People learn by positive/negative reinforcement, not by words generally. If you say you value reliability, but you continue to date/bang someone who is flaky, that is saying to them you DON'T value reliability and it's okay for them to continue the behavior because they're rewarded. If you're sticking around because of the physical attraction, good sex, familarity, etc, then that's what you actually value. 

It's important to be honest about the things we truly value, and make sure our words align with our actions. 

* It doesn't matter how many fish are in the sea, all that matters is who wants you

Here's a dirty little secret: You could line up thousands of amazing, attractive, suitable dating prospects but the only ones that matter in that line-up are the ones who like you back.

The pool might be wide but it's not deep. Genuine, reciprocal romantic compatibility is rare and going into every date expecting that is only going to leave you jaded and disappointed.

* The ""spark"" often preselects for players/serial daters

Some people view ""the spark"" as simply genuine attraction, common interests, and a fun time together. Totally realistic. But many people view ""the spark"" as being completely wrapped up in eachother, pure bliss, perfect conversation, a completely ""in sync"" connection on date 1, like a movie.

This can happen and be genuine, but it's rare. More often, expecting this quick and fast chemistry from date 1 preselects for players. 

People who are excited about you might get nervous, fumble, say the wrong thing, have some silences. Players, however, are generally charismatic, smooth, charming, good conversation skills, experienced with dating. 

That's not to say you should continue seeing someone you're ""no"" about, but if it's not a perfect date give it a few more shots.

* Low effort, low reward vs high effort, high reward

It's understandable why a lot of people now are gravitating towards dating apps over IRL, but for many people that's the only way they're attempting to date. 

When we talk about ""the old days,"" where meeting was so much easier, what a lot of people forget is those people were putting in more effort. They were more social, less reserved. They couldn't just stay in their houses and hope love came knocking. They had to put themselves out there, by actually leaving the house. 

The highest quality way to actually meet people IMO is through mutual interests/hobby groups/social circle, where the effort is higher but so is the reward. The issue is people want to circumvent the process. They want the end result but they don't want to try as hard through the process.

There's still tons of ways to meet people these days, if you do your research and put yourself out there. This defeatist mindset many people have these days is all in their heads. People are still out socializing, people still meet new people in person, romantic connections are formed IRL all the time. The best thing you can do to branch out of your comfort zone is to get better at socializing with strangers, make yourself visible in more places, and don't get bogged down by the social media bubble telling you there's no other options. 

Hope this helped some of you!

She is going straight from work for this date and she has really been really great (best one I have chatted with)  communicating and being very interested in going on a date.

The thing is we are meeting up quite late at 10:45 PM for drinks. I asked about if she thought it would be hard to find a good spot that late, but she said that we would find a “magical spot”.
I asked her about her covid terms and she said that she loved that I asked.

Thursday evening I had a date with a match from Bumble. It was my first date since May. 

Typically I don’t do dinner as a first date (I’ve been used for a free meal one too many times). However there was a  seafood place neither of us had been to that she wanted to try.

Since it’s been awhile I figured what the hell. It was nice to get dressed up, as that’s not really done for the usual coffee date. I had a good time and I wanted to see her again. She texted me that she made it home safely and that she enjoyed our time together.

Up until 20 minutes ago today that was that last I had heard from her. I figured I got ghosted again.  However she texted me that she really liked my personality and sense of humor, but she wasn’t attracted to me.

It’s not much different than looking for a job. I can interview well and then hear absolutely nothing from the potential employer. 

To her credit though at least she didn’t ghost me, I’m happy about that, but the bar is set really low in that regard. 

I’m tired of being so touch/affection starved. When we hugged at the end of the date it was the first time I had gotten a hug from someone that wasn’t a family member in two years. I wish it lasted a little longer.

I genuinely want to know if anyone really believes that those strategies work or if people just push this toxic dating narrative for amusement and the downfall of others. Also Has anyone ever had success in finding a non toxic relationship or a relationship at all by creating jealousy and playing games or using set time frame limits for responding?

My experience with dating is when I wanna talk to someone I’ll talk to them. If I’m in a position where I need to try to make someone jealous it’s not someone I should wanna be with anyways and I leave. Typically those strategies have been way more effective in garnering girls attention for me and currently I’m in a solid relationship. Of course you don’t want to come on to strong or overwhelm someone but the lengths some people seem to go in order to create these “games” is amazing to me and I wonder if that’s just an internet persona or real life.

Anyways I know this came off as more of a rant but if anyone has any situations where these types of advice worked for them or where it backfired on someone when they used it on you I would actually love to hear it.

I'll call him Ben. We've met up three times so far and are planning on going on a fourth date (I'm on holiday at the moment so we haven't organised it yet). Anyway, I'm just starting to doubt that he's into me - but I can't tell if it's my anxious/obsessive tendencies flaring up or if I should actually pay attention to my feelings and just end it before I get hurt. I just don't want to waste my time either. But at the same time, I haven't clicked so well with anyone on a dating app before and am worried it would be a mistake if I ended things so quickly. So I could do with a second opinion.

It's probably just easiest if I list out what's going well and what's making me doubt things, so it's easier to read.

**What's going well**

1. So far he's been keen to meet up every time, and has suggested what we should do etc. He's also arrived on time and been keen to hang out for several hours - I've always been the one to say I need to go.
2. We have a good rapport on the dates and the conversations have flowed well/we've asked each other questions.
3. He hasn't initiated any sexual/romantic talk (which is actually quite refreshing) but he's complimented my hair several times. He also hasn't initiated anything physical (except hugging at the beginning and end of dates) but tbh I haven't either. I think honestly we're both quite awkward - like one time he put his hand on my arm but it caught me off guard and I didn't really do it back.
4. He's offered to pick me up from my house in his car a couple of times for our dates - this hasn't happened yet though because I haven't really agreed to it yet and we haven't organised it.

**Why I'm having doubts**

1. The number one reason I'm having doubts recently is because he takes forever to reply to my messages (we moved from Bumble to Whatsapp).I would say he messages about once a day, max twice. The one good thing is that I think his texting habits have been pretty consistent i.e. when we were on Bumble he also used to message at this frequency and has kept it relatively the same since then (I think??).I should probably mention our conversation is like a never-ending stream of different topics with multiple paragraphs (we don't message 'good morning/night' and we just continue the convo until we meet up basically), so maybe it takes a couple of minutes to get through it all and requires a bit more thought than just single messages.I am actually someone who is an \*awful\* texter and can even take days or weeks to respond to my friends, so I do understand that texting can feel like a chore. But when it comes to a potential partner, it personally never feels like a chore for me. I'm excited to text him/enjoy texting him, and I would want/expect him to feel the same!Ben will also openly go on Whatsapp but won't read my messages - but I know because he has his active status on. Granted, I sometimes do this with him too but not as often (and it's always when I'm really busy/in work).Plus, it's not even like I'm replying to Ben straight away either - on average, I take a few hours to respond myself, I would say, as I'm busy working during the day. But as soon as I'm free, I text him. It just doesn't feel like he's doing the same to me though. I know this because sometimes it's been late at night and he's finally replied and I message back instantly/within a couple of minutes and he doesn't reply until the next day. At that point, it just feels like he's deliberately avoiding the message, which surely can't be a good sign?
2. His energy in the texts feels slightly off lately. I remember when we texted on Bumble he was super enthusiastic, sending long messages. He's still enthusiastic now, and still asks questions etc. But the enthusiasm feels ever so slightly less so (i.e. messages not as long/expansive). I can't tell if this is just because he's getting comfortable or if he's just losing interest? It feels too soon IMO to get comfortable but idk
3. He's never messaged me first after our dates. I've always been the one to message within an hour or two after the date just to say 'hey, I enjoyed it' and suggest meeting up again. Granted, maybe if I left it, he would message the next day or something. He could also be playing it cool, and he does seem quite shy - but I just don't know

I feel silly to fixate on the texting but I do care a lot about keeping in touch in between dates, and I suppose I'm looking for someone who's on the same page - because if not, I think I would constantly be questioning the relationship tbh. I have considered bringing it up to him - just to let him know that I would like us to communicate more frequently throughout the day - but because we're in such early stages that would definitely feel too soon and way too needy. Plus there's a part of me that feels like it should come naturally to him if he really liked me.

I have considered that maybe once we start getting closer/physical then maybe he will be in touch more often, but then I guess I'm focusing on his potential rather than the reality of what he's like now. There's also a part of me that's like, well, even if he does like me, but doesn't like to text, maybe we aren't suited to each other in that respect and this mismatch will just be what inevitably makes us break up?

My gut is telling me that he just isn't that interested and this isn't going to get better. But I can't tell if I'm overreacting. Maybe it's a good sign he's taking it slow and isn't being too forward. But we're always told 'if he wanted to, he would' and that men fight for what they want if they really like a girl. Do you think I should end it?

Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She also told me that she hadn’t really dated anyone in years and never even kissed anyone.

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfterbal. 

After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

So does yours

It doesn’t really matter if you’re very young, like five. Or you’re 36. Like me. It just doesn’t make sense. But there are too many of us, so you can’t count.

Paragraph 5

Subsection b

“A rat’s nest”

Did that make sense to you? It made sense in my love. I just skipped first ten paragraphs divided them by two and jumped straight to subsection b. Because that’s what you do in love. Oh, and yeah, that section has a title. “A rat’s nest”. Of my love.

Why would you give a name to chapter of your love “A rat’s nest”.

You heard better description?

You into toxic relationship? Abusive? Tragic maybe?

I just believed in you.

So what’s in a rat’s nest? What can you find there? Is there like scary? When you can have a look at it in daylight. That shouldn’t be scary. Should a rat’s nest be scary in a field on a sunny summer day just lying. Maybe it’s even empty. The rat left long ago. In a past life.

Now did she leave me or did I leave her?

I read all the books and I watched the DVD. She said, ""Get rid of all the things that you think you need."" I gave away my record collection, I became a volunteer.

So I've actually called (a couple times now) to ask her out over the phone, at least that way I'm talking to her one on one and we can have a private conversation...

Women calling men incels and creeps, men claiming women enforce a double standard and are lazy and entitled. Rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat. 

In the LGBT community, it's not much different. People are just arguing and arguing. About terms, bigotry, rights. It feels like you have to be SO careful to not upset anyone. 

I don't identify with any particular community (maybe Pan or Bi but labels don't interest me), but i find every ""group""  attractive regardless of gender. That shit isn't even a discussion point in my mind and I'm not actively promoting my own rights as someone who might want to be with a man or women, trans or not, and anything in between. And of course i agree fighting for rights and equality is necessary. The lack of them is a major contributor to this problem.

When I participate in discussions on dating and relationship subs, my intentions are earnest. I try to help people, to understand perspectives, and to just give my honest opinions. 

But there's almost always a contentious argument and people that are rude.

And there are always generalizations and assumptions about a group of people.

I like it when there's camaraderie, when people are nice to each other. 

But it seems like on these types of subs, the down votes are soooo popular and the arguments and generalizations are everywhere.

Why are we all so toxic to one another online? It makes me really sad and it genuinely upsets me. 

Why can't we BEHAVE? Can we just have discussions without escalating to arguments? I know, I'm a sensitive baby. But sometimes it pains me how negative things are because I'm active online.

Is it a human thing or an internet thing? What is it? Can't we all be a little nicer? I'm guilty of not being nice sometimes too! But it's typically in response to something rude that was directed at me personally.

The second one is more problematic. I consider myself an extrovert. I can easily talk to girls and be myself. However, I've never got them interested enough.
