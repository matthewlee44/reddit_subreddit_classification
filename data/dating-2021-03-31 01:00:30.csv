1,mgzuv5,1617172259,Just a pleasantry of sorts? (28M),"I met this girl (26F) over a dating app about a year ago, went on one date and got rejected when I followed up on grounds that she was just back to the dating scene and needed time to recalibrate what she was looking for. I probed slightly more saying that I felt a spark but she said that she’s sorry that she didn’t feel the same/maybe it’s cuz she is quite comfortable with most ppl.

Things ended amicably and she said she wasn’t afraid if I approached her some time down the road. I occasionally texted her a couple of times just to test the water and always received slow replies that didn’t lead to anywhere. My last text to her was made in Sep 20 just to end things off since my last reply was seen but not replied; telling her that “guess you’re busy, in any case, if you would like to reconnect, you know where to find me”and I left her with a YouTube music link to a song that I thought she would appreciate. That message was left unread. A few weeks after I noticed she rejected my FB friend request.

Fast forward to New Year’s Day, I wished her a good 2021 ahead just to end it and mentally move on completely. Then suddenly when I thought I was over this, she just texted me (4 months after) saying that she literally just opened my text since she doesn’t use that messenger app much. She said she was doing well and hoped I was doing the same in the current situation.

So I replied her saying it was a pleasant surprise to hear from her and that I’m doing fine. I noticed she had sent me a text at 2am so I made a (weak) joke that I hoped she was awake by choice and that the song link I sent her would be a good companion. Haven’t heard from her for about 3-4 days and my message is left unread again.

From what I see, she probably saw my sep20/new year text and didn’t want to reply so she just pretended that she didn’t open up the app until now (when she wants to clear her chats). 

I’m mentally prepping myself to just ignore anything else and continue to move on but am I perhaps missing out on something? I would say her recent reply just threw me off my recovery path.

To me, it would not have been rude per for to her having ghosted me (what I thought initially) after the New Year message considering that I have no mutual friends with her and unlikely will bump into her anytime soon. I got the hint back in September but was being obstinate.

Honestly I think she was just trying to be polite, but indirectly caused a healing wound to reopen.

11,mh0yjg,1617176966,"Am I really ""something special"" for him or not? I'm confused.","There is this guy (m24) I (f22) know since June 2020. When we first met on tinder we both agreed that we just want a fwb and started texting on Snapchat. We both get along very well, have the same stupid sense of humor and the same interests. However, we never actually met, because of his work or because I was already seeing someone (he too, but never exclusive). Nevertheless, he continued to text and flirt with me regularly.

Now my FWB ended and we want to meet soon. It's a little complicated now, because he had to move back to his parents, who live 2 hours away from my town. He told me before that his ex-girlfriend (who he wanted to marry one day) cheated on him, but that it was not 'a big deal' for him. Since then he's single and has sex on a regular basis with quiet a lot women, often spontaneous. He is very handsome and charming so that's not a big surprise. He never lied to me about his activities.

Up to this point everything is fine, but he now said things that make me a little insecure: ""You are something special, for real. You're awesome, we're so similar it's creepy"" and ""It would be so nice to be in a relationship again"" (""but until now there was not a connection with the women I already met""). This makes me thoughtful, because I'm open for a relationship and I don't know if he really means the things he said to me. He doesn't have to say these things to have sex with me, he knows I want him, I know he wants me. 

He told me he'll let me know when he's free to meet me and that he absolutely wants that! Yesterday he told me (after I asked) that he had spontaneous sex on the weekend with the neighbor of a friend, after BBQ and it was ""nice casual/normal Sex"". I didn't really know how to feel about it, because he can do whatever he wants - just like me. I still thought he'd text me and I told him this. He replied that he only went to the friend for 1-3 hours (no time to drive all the way to me). ""It was nice normal sex but let's not talk about others. I want you!!"" he texted me. 
I once dated a guy who met other woman frequently beside me and I know that it's a huge turn off for me. 

In conclusion: I can only repeat we're not in a relationship, so he can do whatever he wants. 
My problem is that we get along perfectly, have contact since over a year (it's like we can't let go of each other) and now he told me those things that I'm different than others/special and that he's generally open for a relationship, if he finds a special someone. But he's also a guy who has sex with a lot of women and I don't know what to do now. I don't want to be hopeful when I'm in the end just like a trophy for him. I'm so confused :/

12,mh1aug,1617178366,What are the best questions to ask on a first date?,"First date is essentially to evaluate the similarity of the two people with one another and know not many key interests/attitudes of the other. 

I would zero in additional on the inquiries that a person should pose to a young lady on their first date. 

1. First of all: As she is concurred for a date with you, all things considered, she ought to approve of your looks and investing some energy with you and don't be urgent in knowing whether she like you or investing time with you. 

2. When the primary point is clear, it is compulsory for a person to comprehend that the young ladies improve and care/spoil and backing her for what she is and above all don't pass judgment on her. 

As the standard procedures are set, start the discussion like this: 

1. When you were little,what did you fantasy about being the point at which you grew up? [You understand what she needs to be and in the event that she is seeking after it or not] 

2. In the event that there is a plausible excuse/twin for you, what attributes/characteristics would be useful in distinctive you from her ? [Good thing is you will hear, the genuine unmistakable abilities she has and not the banality terms] 

3. If at any point there was a circumstance to propose to your SELF(opposite sex with same characteristics and accurate reproduction), how precisely and what precisely you propose ? 

4. Sit peacefully for 10-15 minutes and simply investigate her eyes unobtrusively and let the correspondence occur through quietness and grins. [You may think this is unusual yet you will associate with the other individual on an extremely profound level. Continuously see at her at whatever point you ask/sit tight for a reaction, she can't lie.] 

5. What do you think your definitive reason for the presence. [this helps in realizing how cognizant the other individual is of themselves(self mindfulness quotient)] 

time to change the play: 

The time has come to request that she surmise the responses to similar inquiries regarding yourself. You can continue to right as she say and give clarifications as and when required. 

You need to value all her occasions she makes a correct theory and that helps in keeping up the energy. 

The central issue is allowed her to communicate everything, you be the arbitrator. The benefits are a great deal, you are giving her heaps of consider herself and comprehend her as a superior individual too. The second piece of the cycle helps in setting up some interest in knowing your subtleties for her also and trust me she is going to recall each piece of theory she got right and I guarantee there will be incredible comprehension between the two individuals. 

There are various different inquiries/followup addresses that can be asked yet I am parting with just not many here as it isn't fixed, you must be inventive and ask according to the circumstance.

20,mh2e6z,1617183074,I think I'm starting to see how meeting people itself can still be nice even if things don't work out.,"I've struggled with dating pretty much as long as I've felt attracted to people (I'm 27 now). With the exception of two very short lived positive relationships and my last relationship that ended horribly, it felt like seemingly every time I met somebody, things did not work out for varying reasons. Due to this, I struggle pretty bad with the fear of nothing working out.

I've been posting about this stuff on reddit for a few years now and one thing I have seen in response to several of my posts is the suggestion to just see dating and meeting people as fun itself and just enjoy that part of it instead. This was not something I was able to wrap my head around. It made no sense to see rejection as fun, as well as all the energy I had sucked out of me in my past experiences as fun either. I'd just think of how things didn't seem to ever work out and I'd ruminate on that and feel scared and horrible about my future with this stuff.

Then like a week ago I met a girl who is dating a mutual friend, and I started crushing for her really bad. She is ridiculously sweet and attractive and shares the same sense of humor as me, that last trait in particular really standing out as I rarely meet girls with that in common anymore. However, she is already together with the mutual friend, and I respect them and myself too much to create a really shitty and awkward situation like that. 

I immediately started feeling like shit and feeling horrible about everything as usual, but this time something different happened. I was really distant one day and she reached out and asked me what was wrong and offered to talk to me. Of course, I still never admitted I was having feelings for her, but I just spoke broadly about my problems with relationships for a bit. She really listened to me and would wait until she wasn't busy with something to take the time to give a thoughtful response and we grew closer as friends in the end. She told me I deserved to be happy and it felt sincere instead of just as a courtesy from somebody rejecting me.

After that, I started thinking about what just happened and our friendship and I started feeling way better even though nothing else really changed. She's still with our mutual friend, I still have feelings that I won't admit, and I still don't really see how something is going to work out for me with somebody in the future. However, this experience didn't end so horribly like I was initially making it out to be. If I kept meeting more people like her, or people I like as much as her, and they also turn out like this, I can actually see how that can be nice. I think I can see what those reddit comments were trying to say now. This feels like a huge deal because if I'm not scared to try dating and meeting people again, I can actually at least make the attempt to do so and keep trying when things don't work out and maybe enjoy the process of it after all.

Things didn't work out with this girl I like a lot but I'm still so glad we met and became friends. I didn't think I'd ever see things this way.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mh2e6z/i_think_im_starting_to_see_how_meeting_people/

I’ve been dating to this guy for a month. We starting talking through a mutual friend and would just text and call each other. Im really not great at texting cause sometimes I just don’t want to answer so I’d disappear for a few hours/days and he would do the same.

I know cliche title, but that's the situation","So I've (31M) been hanging out with this girl (27F) every other week during this year. We had dated 3 years ago for like 6 months, broke up, but kept in good terms, nad never actually lost contact. When we didn't hang out we would also watch a movie through Teleparty or something. Recently she even told me to go on a getaway trip. So I thought she was trying to go serious again, but then she started to go silent, so I also began questioning myself where this was going. The last couple of hangouts have been proposed by her as well.

Anyway, this week she told me she had gotten a new haircut and it would be a good excuse to show me if we hung out, and I said sure. But the day after I found out by her WhatsApp status that she was actually seeing someone else. I got curious and saw that they had been dating for a while.

I know we weren't actually dating, but it felt like she was trying to lead it to that, and now I found about this and I don't know what comes next. I ghosted her since the last she texted me, but if she texts me again I think I'll come up with an excuse. I don't know if I should confront her in some way for this, since to me clearly she was hanging out with me as friends and I was the one seeing it as something else. Or am I being to naive?

41,mh6lg1,1617198800,Is it becoming the norm for girls in their 20s to prefer teen guys?,"I've noticed a trend with girls in their 20s where it is way more common for them to express attraction to younger teen boys, including underage boys. I was on a date with a 28 year old girl and we were watching a movie where one of the actors was like 13, and she straight up said he was ""hot"". On another occasion a friend who is 25 mentioned the waiters being attractive at a particular restaurant and then expressed wondering whether they were old enough to be pouring alcohol. She then said how she thinks the age required to pour alcohol is 16, then said actually 18...sooooo essentially these waiters look like they're younger than 16-18 and they're attractive to her?? 

It's interesting because the stereotype is guys preferring younger girls, but the preference for teen girls among guys is pretty much non-existent. Even teen guys would say girls in their 20s are more attractive.

Our convos started off like a casual thing but because of covid we couldn’t meet up for a month. Past the first week our convos became more meaningful and we started to plan things we could do together. Im not a fan of texting but we ended up texting about 7 hours everyday between work and by that i mean like 2 min reply times. Usual good morning, goodnight texts and she opened up about her personal problems too. I set up a date for an evening but she suggested another time because she wanted to spend more time with me and go out for breakfast. 

On the date night due to circumstances (few housemates) we didn’t sleep together but we cuddled the whole night. Morning after went out for breakfast. I was ready to leave and go home after that but she wanted to show me around town so we went for a 4 hour drive and also ended up getting lunch. She wanted to hold my hand the whole drive and even joked about us being hot together. She even asked that she really hopes she met my expectations. At the end she suggested that we should go on a second date. A poorly timed second date was organised for few days later. (Only had 2 hours free the both of us)

She texted the usual had a really good time and really enjoyed your company. The night before the second date she confirmed if its still on. The morning she canceled saying we wont have enough time and asked to reschedule to next weekend. Still texted normally for the next 3 days and then bam on the fourth her replies became less enthusiastic and bit drier. 

She had a big exam the next week so i started texting less and less because of her replies and asked if she is still free the weekend which she wasn’t due to studying. After that i only ended up messaging every 3 days. 

On the weekend she posted that she is going to start therapy regarding something she went through which she opened up to me about earlier. She got mostly guy friends and on her snapstory i saw that a guy made a sneaky appearance twice now. I asked if she is free the weekend but she said because of what she is dealing with she is only seeing close friends and her therapist told her that she shouldn’t start anything romantic/sexual right now, so she would like to remain just friends.

Normally i would take that as a fuck off but her situation made it somewhat believable. That guy made another appearance and she posted that she had a 4 hour call where he listened to her problems. So yeah its been two weeks since i messaged her. The mixed signals, confusion and uncertainty really tangled me up. Not sure where i went wrong. Im tempted to message her in a week or month to see how she is doing but i don’t see the point if she is seeing someone else at the moment.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mh6v0s/a_month_of_texting_a_great_first_date_and_then/

I'm a 19-year-old guy from England and I really struggle to meet girls.

I'm a pretty introverted person at first which I think was mainly due to me getting picked on as a kid for my looks because having red hair at school is a pretty easy target lol. Once people get to know me I'm quite open and a lot less shy, but initially I'm a closed book to most people due to my anxiety.

I've started working out to improve myself slowly as I'm on the skinnier end but I wouldn't consider myself extremely unattractive or anything, I'm just an average-looking person.

My interests include sports, religion, video games, university, etc. Perhaps this will help someone understand how I could meet people in a social setting (assuming COVID-19 rules don't apply).

I suppose my question is what can I do to improve my chances of meeting people who may have similar interests to me and is there anything I can do to better my odds of creating a meaningful relationship? By the way, please don't suggest that I should download Tinder, Bumble, etc - not really a fan of how the dating scene works there.

50,mh7syl,1617202340,I really do not understand what number of sexual partner had signifies about a male (the way women tend to think about that),"Disclaimer: I know that there is no ""general thinking"" and ""women"" is a very heterogenous group. Still, I want to get the reasoning behind the following:

24 m who has a lot of female friends. This week, I talked to two of them and I observed that both of them texted with older men (in the 30y old range) and when considering them as a partner told me the concern that ""he has only slept with 2 girls"". 

However, I do not get why more would be better. I mean, of course if you have slept with more people then you could be more ""experienced"" than someone who did less, but then this is also not necessarily true (if a person is in a relationship the number stays at +1, but you still probably gain more experience than someone who had 5 one night stands). I really do not get how this could possibly be a turn-off, but it seems to be for these two and I heard that reasoning before. I also do not get why 150 would be a ""better"" number than 2. 

What is your opinion on this? How would a curve for the number of sex partners your partner should have had look like?

Weirdly, one of them turned out to be one of my biggest cheerleaders and tells me I'm great a lot.

A couple of months ago I went on a date with a guy just out of a relationship. We'd had a really great time so it came out of the blue that he didn't want to date me as he didn't think he was in a place to but wanted to be friends as he knew we'd have a great time together. Because he took the time to tell me this I agreed and we see each other most weeks.

We met up last night and although there were a couple of flirty moments, he also told me that he'd been seeing a girl for a few weeks but it hadn't worked out. This made me really confused because it coincided with him flirting with me... it left me feeling super confused and kind of hurt as he'd told me he wasn't in a place to date and then flirted with me but was also dating someone.

I do go to therapy for it, I did make a lot of good progress. Until I started dating my Ex. 

I started dating this girl, I was older, she was younger. Things were going extremely well at first, she treated me well, loving, wanted me badly, etc. About 6 months in she 180'd and started treating me poorly, would talk back, be extremely negative, abusive even. Wouldn't want to do anything with me, would always be messaging other guy friends that I trusted her with, because I always think innocent until proven guilty. They would flirt with her, I told her how it made me feel uncomfortable. She said she'd stop, months later she started talking to them again, they kept hitting on her madly and she'd just accept all of it. One night she went out drinking with her best friend, ended up making out with a guy. I broke up with her. She comes back crying for like 3 months begging for me. Low confidence me accepted and we're dating again. 1 more year of agony, because she had other qualities that were ""amazing"", She went out drinking again, made out with more guys. I saw messages pop up on her phone about how she planned to lie to me and hook up with one of the guys I didn't need to worry about. I broke up, this time permanently. I know that I simped hard, she was very emotionally abusive and manipulative, we had sex like 6 times over 3 years, my self confidence completely obliterated by her as I try to boost hers. She would humiliate me in front of my friends, she hated herself and projected it on me. After dating her, I ended up going out and casually meeting girls, everything felt pretty dull and it made it very easy for me to pick up, since I just didn't care anymore, there was nothing in me to give or care about, I was empty and felt nothing.

2 years later since dating this girl, I'm completely fine with the first 2 months of talking to someone. I can go up to any girl and not care, I'm confident, I don't think, I do well. The second I start to feel something, all the manipulation and pain comes back, it's like I can't escape what she did to me, how she treated me, it still haunts me. It's not fair to the people I talk to and it's not fair to me. Luckily I'm not the person to project my feelings negatively, I just get anxious, feel the pain, and become ""too nice, too respectful"" if that makes any sense, as my confidence drops and my trauma resurfaces. I deeply regret staying as long as I did in that relationship, I should have left after she stopped treating me with respect, but I didn't, and now I continue suffering, it's ruining potential relationships. I'm trying to heal, it's been hard.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mh99r0/still_suffering_2_years_later/
64,mh9gpz,1617207016,I bet so many people on dating apps have missed opportunities with matched they would have hit it off with had they met IRL instead,"People act very different from behind a screen than they would in IRL, and the only way I can describe it in the context of online dating is that in person, most of us are usually very grounded and not so dismissive of others, where as on a dating app, a lot of people are always trying to flex hard in their profiles, have short attention spans, and an unreasonable expectation out of their matches.

I sometimes wonder how many of us have actually come across someone on a dating app who if they met us IRL rather than saw us on a dating app, they'd have hit it off with us, but because of  all of these internalized biases, assumptions, bad experiences, and daydreams people focus on with dating apps, you never stood a chance. 

Whenever I hear how people have been on and off dating apps for years with no real success, my guess is that at some point, they probably came across at least one person on there who could have saved you the time from ever needing to rejoin the app again, but tunnel vision prevented that.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mh9gpz/i_bet_so_many_people_on_dating_apps_have_missed/

Our love has grown very strong and it’s getting to the point where I know we are going to want to meet soon. In our messages to each other it gets very sexually graphic and we always talk about the things we want to do together. I know he has experience because he has mentioned it in the past, but he does not know that I do not have experience. I’m assuming he thinks I have experience because he’ll say things like “I want to please you like you’ve never been pleased”. But maybe he’s just saying that? My question is, am I leading him on to think that I have experience by the way I talk sexually to him? I have never flat out said whether or not I have experience, but I don’t want him to think or even hope that I do and then when he finds out the truth he’s disappointed. He says he loves me more than anything, so if he finds out that I am an not experienced do you think that will change his love for me? Should I tell him before we meet? I also don’t want to make it into a big deal, I’m just not sure how to go about this. I don’t want him to be mad.

TL;DR Guy I’ve been talking to online for the last few months does not know that I am inexperienced. Are my sexual messages to him leading him on to believe that I am experienced?

66,mh9og5,1617207625,Keep the talking stage to 2-3 months,"Dating now is pretty rough but I have found that the cutoff for the talking stage should be around 2-3 months. After 2-3 months of going on dates, you would be able to get to know this person to the extent of whether or not you would want to be in an exclusive relationship with them. This also gives enough time to determine if I truly like this person and their personality or if it was purely physical attraction.

After 2-3 months of seeing someone, I will express that I want to commit and be exclusive and ask where their head is at. If they say that they aren't sure, I will move on. In the situations where I’ve ""waited it out"", it has ended up being a waste of time because they couldn't commit even months later.

71,mh9tpj,1617208022,"Need help with girl, no clue what to do","So, I’ve had my eye on this girl at my work who works in another department so I see her here and there. Finally since 4-5 months ago just 2 weeks ago I built up the courage to talk to her when she was on her break. We talked I didn’t ask for her snap or anything and that was that went well. Then when I saw her around I attempted to j say hi (her name) and mind you she’s VERY shy very introverted and doesn’t like people. So her hi’s were very quiet. Anyways fast forward to last Monday I talked to her again on break, went amazing like probably the best night of the last year so far I’ve just been working and in university so this was the most excitement of got in a long long time especially since we’re in a pandemic. Yea so I talked to her for like 30 mins on my lunch then when my lunch ended I told her I gtg back to work and she said well I’m basically done now I have nothing to do so she walked with me to my department and she followed me around as I stocked the shelves and we talked for a long time like we spoke for 30mins then she finished at the time my lunch was done so her sister came to pick her up at 10:00 when she was finished and while she followed me around and we talked her sister called her multiple times and texted her and I noticed she kept ignoring it and j texting her sister back, anyways long story short she made her sister wait 45 mins outside work meanwhile she talked to me and many times I said to her u know if u have to go I don’t wanna keep u and ur sister and she was like nah it’s okay I told her I’m talking to someone she’s cool with it. Yea so fast forward to about 10:45-10:50 while we’re still talking her sister comes into the store and yells out her name and I’m like what was that she rolls her eyes she’s like nothing it’s my sister she came in. So then we’re standing there talking and her sister is walking towards us and I’m j like scared like am I gonna get yelled at. I j say hi and she says hi then I start leaving cuz my shift was almost done and she’s j talking to her sister quietly for a min and I start walking slowly away with my stuff so I can end my shift and I get a lol far waiting for her and it looks pre heated their conversation, and eventually she turns around comes back to talk to me more, and we end up talking for another like 10 mins or so. Then she says yea I have to go now and she says goodnight and everything and I get a huge from her and this whole time she told me the second before she left she completely forgot to clock out, put her clothes in her work locker, and get her bag. So she had to go back to the back and do all that. Anyways so I’m excited as can be I leave work about 20 mins later I snap her and she snaps back and we start snapping a lot we’re still snapping each other. Then a couple days later she’s in work again I get her number as she was passing by and her entire face goes red well like I said she’s rlly shy. So I text her to go to lunch together and we were supposed to but then, she ended up having to take it late at around when she finishes and it just didn’t work and she gave me some excuse about “Covid” so I got pretty upset but I said it’s okay I left for lunch cuz I usually go home. Then as soon as I leave she texts me “I’m sorry, I feel so bad” and I didn’t respond for like 2 hours cuz I was j kinda annoyed tbh cuz I waited a bit later so she could come to lunch. Then the next day we were texting and she explained to me how she was sorry and that she usually explains to people how her dad is high risk for this virus and she’s afraid of getting it and giving it to her dad. She said it’s not like I think u have Covid but just in case I don’t wanna be the one who gets my dad sick and everything I’m j scared to. And she says how she hasn’t seen her friend in like 3 months and she always says how boring her life is and everything. So I understood and I told her it’s okay and I wouldn’t wanna force her into it in that case. Anyways then she also said that it’s not like my dad isn’t letting us see people, it’s j a choice I made. So I got kinda confused and hoped that maybe there still some hope for a date. Anyways I see her at work again a couple times and just yesterday I asked her again if she was going home for lunch or if she maybe wanted to go out and get something she said “I  have to be carefulll remember” and so I got it I understood and I told her yea that’s true it’s okay. Then now idek what to do because a couple nights since last week she stayed up late talking to me either on snap or on text message, and as soon as I didn’t respond for whatever reason she just fell asleep. Also she would come by where I’m working sometimes and after her shift was done and she would talk to me I would goto her at times to. So I figured I’d ask her to lunch yesterday. Now Idk how to feel, should I j wait and see how things go going forward or j move on to another girl and forget about this, because I really can’t do anything about this and I don’t wanna be the one who gave her dad Covid and I certainly do not want to start a potentially good relationship on something like that. My buddy told me he feels like the Covid reason is huge bullshit because she goes out to the mall w her sister still. Also I’m really kind of against waiting for a girl I barely know, like I like her a lot and I wanna get to know her more, I’ve tried to over text but u can only go so far over text that’s why I wanted to j go on a date. Also my semester finishes like end of April and I’m actually going to work at a car dealership for the summer until school starts again, and it’s kind of unfortunate because I feel that if I don’t get on a date with this girl by that time, I see no reason to continue talking to her. Idk what to do here, should I j keep talking to her here and there at work and not worry ab the a date yet, or should I j move on because there certainly is plenty of fish in the sea.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mh9tpj/need_help_with_girl_no_clue_what_to_do/

The first date was amazing – we both acknowledged it was the best of our lives – the second one was decent but definitely fell short of the high bar we set at Date #1. She texted me after our second date to say that she was nowhere near ready to date again after her six-year relationship ended last summer (I posted about this separately if anyone is curious and wants the full background). I have since done a lot of reflection and am pretty confident that the real reason she broke things off is that she really wasn't feeling the chemistry on our second date; there were red flags on that date that she wasn't feeling it anymore which I'm happy to elaborate on if anyone is curious. But I do want to emphasize that our first date, FT conversations, phone calls before that were all really great, to the point where she had told her friends about me and talked about seeing this going somewhere. 

Anyway, she broke things off earlier this week, and I responded with *Thanks for your honesty. I respect your decision, wish you the best.* And that was that.

I am considering reaching out to her again in a month to ask her if she wants to have coffee, and to tell her *I wasn't feeling like myself on our last date which is probably why our chemistry felt off compared to our first date.* and *if you're not interested that's cool.*

I guess I just want to know - mainly for the women out there - if you were really invested in a guy early on, and then lost interest after a few dates, and then a month later, he sent you a message like that, how would you respond?

75,mhalng,1617210197,So that ended here...,"
So i met this girl on reddit back in January, we became friends quite quickly. We’re of the same age too. Later on we created a discord server for our sub. And we all got more close to each other there. I had a crush on this girl who i mentioned above. I invited a dude i met around the same time.
Everything was in place. We did a face reveal one day and this guy got a crush on her as well. Was flirting with her too. Kinda made me uneasy but i’m busy with exams and shit so couldn’t bother much either. I never cared too much about it. We’re both preparing for the same entrance exam (me and her). 

Then when i left the server, she DMed me and said ‘do drop a message whenever you pass by’. In another one i said ‘we’d meet again on discord soon!’ , she replied ‘we’d meet in real life!’. And the convo went like that. Was fun and got personal at times. She was the one who DMed me first all the time. And well today was the day. I pinged that guy(my friend) and asked about their ‘relationship’. It’s a YES. They’re both in an LDR and said she’s also willing to wait for him. She’s 18. He’s 19. Both introverts. Never met before irl. She’s in HS. He’s a College Junior. And they both landed in an LDR within 14 days since they met. He sent a convo and well it’s true. She was reciprocating to his flirty texts. But never said a direct yes. They were talking like ‘nuuu uuu is cuteee’ and shit.

And today she abruptly made up an excuse to talk to him. We were talking for like 1 hr and then she went like ‘byee i’ve got to make food’. Lie. He was online. And he told me she’s texting him. 

I kinda feel a little shit now. Even if i had foreseen this. She just saw me as a timepass ig. But fault is mine to have drawn such lame ass conclusions. His approach was little creepy and felt like he lacked confidence (was deleting stuff immediately after posting, esp flirty texts). But this worked out? Sigh.

76,mhao1j,1617210380,Dating with a Messed Up Past/Family,"I'm not sure how my parents even came together and married, but I'm the product of good and evil. One side of my family is outrageously embarrassing and the other so prude (old school Catholic) that they'll dismiss anything less than ""image worthy"". 

My dad was a good guy. Typical dad jokes, live by the book, do the right thing. He kept his immediate family close. He would've been the dad on Tik Tok with his grandkids. 

My mom... she means well but she's a ball of constant ...negative... energy. If I need a good cry with my mom, she'll out trauma me with examples or make comparisons as if my trauma doesn't beat hers. Extremely depressing. Her side of the family partakes in various lifestyles that is highly inappropriate. My sister is bipolar schizophrenic (my mother may be too) and won't take meds. She's violent, loud, rude, ghetto and always angry... ALWAYS. Now, my oldest child is favoring that side of the family and I'm actively getting her therapy and resources to guide her to the good side... but like my mothers side of the family, they're strong willed in making bad decisions.  

I know there are millions like me with family issues.  My problem is I am attracted to men with character like my dad, but in the past I never felt like I deserved it so I settled.  Ended up in an abusive relationship. Became a single mom. I've recovered from the past as if it never happened, but the stigma stills plagues me at 31. I meet men all the time that literally tell me I'm everything they want in a wife... but the kids are a no go to them, their family or image. After hearing that, I sometimes shy away from even telling men I have children.  I know it's wrong, but I just want to enjoy dating wholesome men and enjoying romance because I deserve it 😔. 

The guy I'm dating now is so good to me, but I have anxiety about the future. He sees a big wedding in his future and I have flashes of my immediate family starting an embarrassing fight at the reception or displaying *gasp* worthy behavior.  My moms side of the family is not for the weak. They ruined my spirit my entire childhood and I wouldn't want that anywhere near this guy. He comes from a two parent household, wealthy suburbs, private Schools, etc kind of life and he seeks guidance from them regularly.  I'm so afraid of being judged. He said dating a single mom is new to him (so it'll be new for his parents to hear), but I'm the best person he's ever been with. I feel like my fears are going to ruin another good thing.  


We work in similar fields and have all the same interests. I currently earn more (not that it matters)....  It's just, my past is daunting. I wouldn't even date me if I'm being honest. I cut my family off in my last major relationship and felt bad for it because I'm the happy medium in their lives, but things were peaceful for a while. 

How do I move past this? 

I'm in therapy for the abuse and I'm honestly past it/ healed from that part, but that's the topic every visit 🙄.  I may need to find a new therapist that wants to help me move forward. I've taken genetics and DNA tests to reassure myself that I am nothing like my mothers family. I even do a mental health assessment annually to be sure that I don't have one of their disorders.   

Any advice, similar stories or successful experiences would be appreciated?  I really like this guy and I'm trying not to run from him like I typically would do when things get this deep.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mhao1j/dating_with_a_messed_up_pastfamily/

78,mhbayf,1617212158,Friend can't figure out why I struggle with dating sites and casual dating,"Had a conversation not long ago with a older friend who never did the online dating stuff.  He's trying to convince me to try online dating again becuase I went about it wrong.   

His sticking points were as followed

I was being too picky and should of just swiped every girl since the idea is to meet them  and go from there  and i should only focus on sexual chemistry  first. 

My radius  for distance  should be bigger &amp; that the 30mile radius  i had wasn't big enough and that driving over an hour or 2  shouldn't be a concern if I want to meet women and subsequently get laid and even find a nice girl(maybe)

He  also thinks that becuase his friend( pretty boy Foreigner) was able to get a tinder hookup while visiting means I should be able to as well.  


And his last example was an ex female coworker  in college town found A guy on tinder so there deffinely girls looking  so you shouldn't give up. 


Now, I'm one of the only guys he know who genually struggles to get laid.  He claims I don't want it enough otherwise I'd find a way.   And that I make it harder than it needs to be.    And it genually baffles people why I'm not trying to chase and get women.  (In some ways I feel I can't )   chasing shows thirst  and I don't want to be seen as a thirsty guy wanting to just get his dick wet.  The best I can think of it is I hate the feeling of using other and being used and not sure how to twist that to make it feel better.  

Now, I agree with that last statement.  But I don't know how to go about casual dating/sex.  It's never been something I though was on the table and No woman really showed they were into that with me.  My mind says long term my body says short term and I'm always at this mental spilt of what I want.    I don't know how to act to get women to want to be with me for fun... personally I don't consider myself that hot or fun of a guy.   I'm average there is nothing special about me.   I don't understand why he thinks I just need to try harder with these apps and. Be out and about on weekends at the bars(open in my area)  and be trying to do dumb fun things with women.  

But honestly what makes these  things fun is the lack of understanding how to have fun in these situations. And in turn I get frustrated and angery mostly at myself for not understanding what it takes to get women and being social.    It's hard to take anything small as a win.

83,mhbsdz,1617213557,Can't understand the correlation between doing things and losing respect,"This comes off as an attack on women I suspect, however please know it isn't intended as such. I happen to be a man (40), so women are my point of reference when it comes to dating. 

My grandfather was my hero growing up. I was named for him, and it's an honor to carry his first and last name. One of his trademarks was that he never said no. And people used that to their advantage. Even my grandmother. If she wanted something the answer was always yes. (And make no mistake, various family members took advantage of him frequently.) But that's my frame of reference as a man; basically you're a provider. And I kind of believe in that role when it comes to relationships.

However I've noticed that in relationships (at least contemporary relationships), that never seems to fly. I dated a woman casually for the past year or so. I love her VERY much. And she claimed to feel the same about me - we had both said we could see marrying one another. Since her baby daddy came back into the picture, she's been fizzling out. Told me she'd make time for me, but never has. Something's always come up. It's truly devastating.

And I've done EVERYTHING for this girl. She's never spent a dime in my presence, I took her and hers on vacation with me last summer, etc. And I never minded doing any of that - heck, I'd do it again. As I said, that's kind of how I fly. And I've read a lot of things where they say guys such as me never get the girl, but someone else (in this case the baby daddy) just waltzes into the picture and with minimal effort wins her over. In fact, she told me when she was with the baby daddy before he rarely did anything for her. She was stunned when she realized I was the type to pay the bill for a lady and take care of things. Basically to treat her the right way.

But I could slowly see her losing respect for me in a way as I look back. And make no mistake, I don't want to change. I don't want one devastating experience to make me change who I am. And I don't do things like pay for dinner or take her on vacation because I have an agenda. I do them because I want her to have nice things and to be happy. I'm pretty old school. But I just can't see the logic. Whereas before I'd text her and get a response. I'd call her and she'd pick up right away. Now sometimes she takes a day to respond, and sometimes she just clicks the call to voicemail. I might understand the idea that she assumes I'm not going away or something, but it's still a bitter pill to swallow. It's easy to say ""her loss"" and so forth. But the idea that my own ""goodness"" might make people lose respect for me doesn't sit right with me.

I have a tragically logical mind. The way I see things if someone's going out of their way for me, that's someone I'm going to keep around. Or appreciate. I recognize that it's no guarantee that you're going to date the person, but I certainly wouldn't treat them disrespectfully. And when I look back at my past, there was probably some of this same ""phenomenon."" This is just cutting me deeper because it's someone I love so much and someone I was/am willing to dedicate my life to. If ""going big"" for someone you love triggers people losing respect for you and leaving you for someone who does nothing for them, maybe I'm better off single.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mhbsdz/cant_understand_the_correlation_between_doing/
84,mhbtsc,1617213658,Do I (f20) have to confess I once created a fake profile and send him a message just so he would receive a notification and come online to reply to my real profile because I thought it took him so long?,"I did this in the first/second month we first started talking on an app as friends (not a dating app and we never met each other in real life). My only goal was that he would get a notification on his phone because I thought that he maybe didn’t receive the notifications (happened to me a lot) or deleted the app and that’s why it took him longer then usual to reply (me being bored in quarantine totally forgot he had a life in a different country). I didn’t even think he would reply to the fake profile because I had no profile pic but he did and I just feel so bad and I really regret what I did. I see it as a big lesson I learned from and I would never do it again. It gave me a lot of anxiety and I keep overthinking what I did. At the time I thought we would stop talking to each other and never meet. However, we still talk every day and I really enjoy it and I feel like we really get along.

Is this something you should tell your crush/boyfriend about, or is it a “minor” thing you should just forget and is not worth mentioning (like “stalking” your crush on social media)?

85,mhbtth,1617213660,"""Don't you want to get married?""","I just wanted to come here to harmlessly vent for a bit. This is something that has been creeping up on me slowly throughout the years, whether it's a side comment from my Aunt, curiosity from my coworkers, or criticism from my mother. 

I turned 30 a few days ago, and I feel pretty good about it, considering I never thought I'd live past 30 (I was suicidal a lot growing up). Physically, I'm in the best shape of my life and I stay active. No health problems (that I'm aware of!), everything seems to work fine. Mentally, I still have work to do, but this is the most I've liked myself in my whole life. 

I've had my ups and downs with dating, casual flings, and serious relationships over the years, and I've been single for the past 2-3 years now. At first it was by choice, but nowadays I've found myself wanting to get back out there.  It's been a little difficult with the pandemic, but I'm willing to adapt. 

 I understand now that committed relationships take a lot of time and effort, and if I happen to find someone worth it, then great! If not, then it's okay. More time to work on myself. However, my family and whoever else they talk to all seem to share the same concern: ""Don't you want to get married?"" I mean, yeah? Someday, if I meet the right person, that would be cool. But I like things to happen organically and I don't want to get into a relationship just for the sake of not being lonely. They worry that the more I age, the worse it'll be for me. And to some extent that may be true.. IF I want children, and IF I will care about my age affecting my chances of finding someone. I wish their immediate response to me being single all this time would more of the milestones I've had and celebrating my self-growth.

88,mhbyqj,1617214038,Questions for the socially anxious daters out there,"Hi everyone!  Let me start with the fact that I am a socially anxious introvert who has figured out how I can get around my own nerves to manage interactions with others, date, and engage in a lot of public speaking. With that said, I'm trying to alter my career (I'm currently a professor of interpersonal relationships) to help people like me succeed. 

I'm NOT trying to sell you anything, just floating some ideas and questions. (But, I have free session options if you want to talk for free - just message me for my site info) 

Feel free to respond to one or all of these questions. Also, feel free to rip apart my ideas, but please just let me know your reasoning. 

1) My goal is to help socially anxious introverts develop better interpersonal skills so they can meet quality romantic prospects. 

Does that sound good? My friend said it ""lacked humanity,"" but I'm not sure that's true. Would this statement turn you off?

&amp;#x200B;

2) What do you struggle with most as a socially anxious individual?

&amp;#x200B;

3) How would your life be different if social anxiety was less of a problem for you?

&amp;#x200B;

4) Again NOT ASKING FOR YOUR MONEY, but if you had/have disposable income, what would you pay for someone to help you manage your anxiety successfully?

92,mhc9fy,1617214886,being apart for a while while one partner has health issues?,"I'm wondering if you guys could give me some advice about how to handle being apart for a while while one partner is experiencing some health issues early on in a relationship. 

I've been seeing a guy from Hinge for a few weeks and its gone very well. We both agreed we are interested in dating one another exclusively. 

A few days ago he developed some symptoms (fatigue and other stuff) which we thought were covid but after both getting tested we didn't have it so he's waiting to see a doctor. I've not seen him for nearly a week now as a result. As part of him being ill our texting contact has gone down a fair bit though we still talk a little most days, mostly at my initiation. Frankly, I just miss talking to him as much as I used to, especially since I can't see him in person. Plus, not being in touch just really triggers my anxiety. Even though last time we hung out it was really great as usual, I just get constantly paranoid about drifting even though I don't have much evidence to back it  up. I asked if I was texting him too much or bothering him and he said no, he just really felt like crap lately. 

Basically, I'm wondering what you guys think is the best way to approach this. It's still fairly early on in the relationship, so I don't really know if I have the recourse to message him something long-winded about how I want him to text me more, especially if he's feeling crummy. I'm also trying to be mindful of not being too much while he's dealing with a tough time. On the other hand, I'm not sure I have it in me to just sit around with minimal contact for when/if he fully recovers. 

Do you guys think its better to give him space while he deals with this, even if I am kind of antsy and want to text him frequently for updates? My game plan for now is just to suck it up for a few days and try to get in touch later, which I am having trouble sticking with due to aforementioned antsyness, so if you guys had any thoughts or affirmations about this strategy I'd love to hear them. 

PS: I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt here and assuming he's not being dishonest about the health problems. I guess it is a possibility but it feels kind of out of character and if it were the case I'd deal with it later on. ",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mhc9fy/being_apart_for_a_while_while_one_partner_has/
93,mhce0q,1617215242,BJ on 3rd date?,"Hello! I 28/f had 2 wonderful dates with this guy 27/m. He has done the asking out and pursuing me. On our 3rd time getting together, he came over to my place to hang out low key. We messed around and I gave him a blowjob, but didn’t have sex. He asked what it would take to have sex, and I said him not hooking up with other girls while we are. I said having sex makes me feel vulnerable and I only like to have it with those I’m exclusive with. 

He slept over and was sweet in the morning and when he kissed me goodbye he said he will text me (we will see if he does...that will be the big indicator to see if he is still interested) 

A couple of questions:
1. Do you think he disrespects me for giving him a BJ? I know we didn’t have sex, but not sure if he thinks I’m dirty with giving him that still
2. Am I spooking him/putting too much pressure by telling him I need exclusivity for sex?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mhce0q/bj_on_3rd_date/

95,mhcmdy,1617215900,Confusing Date Sitch - would love some input:)," Hey people,

So, on Monday I had a date (M23) with (F18). Dated 6 years older than me before, the same age and a little younger but never experienced this before...

We had a great first date: lots of laughs, compliments back and forth, sat in the sun &amp; even a fair bit of kissing (weyy). Even had a bit of gazing in each others eyes and she blushed heavily (very cute). We said after leaving each other that we'd see each other again but after suggesting Wednesday or Thursday on text.... no response?

I understand she could be busy and has her own life but a text to say ""I'm a bit busy"" wouldn't have gone a miss.

What do you think? Leave it until she replies or a non-pushy text saying ""Would still like to see you so just lmk when you're about""?
