I realize that I have really forgotten (or did I ever know?) what a truly healthy relationship looks like.  

The men in my life that I've spent the most time with ( Dad, husband and last bf) were all somewhat or highly dysfunctional.  My dad was an alcoholic who treated me well but my mom like crap and basically didn't do shit to take care of our family and was very, VERY selfish. He would also go MIA frequently drinking. Mom was the classic co-dependent enabler. She was our rock, but basically taught me to deny my feelings and always look for how to make things look/feel better for everyone else, despite what I felt inside.  I am literally just now figuring out how I feel about certain things that many people would know immediately, esp if it was a negative feeling.  


My ex husband is a self-proclaimed selfish man who has no desire for family (this was proclaimed AFTER we had a kid and were married but I should have seen it coming).  We have been having some interesting talks lately, as we both realize we have some limiting beliefs/messed up ideas about relationships and also discussing how our issues played out in our marriage. It's been incredibly healing and we can speak candidly.  This is helping me see my part in our marriage/divorce and also how wrong he was for me. Had we only known that when we were in our 20's......  


My ex boyfriend was not nearly as dramatically dysfunctional as my dad and my ex husband, but he lacked an emotional availability that was always confusing to me and also lacked any desire/skills to ""work"" on the relationship to overcome issues.   He also could NOT own any mistakes or things he did to hurt me. So once again I was swallowing my pain, which is so familiar to me.  

My biggest issues/pattern is that I try really hard to make something that is 'good' (or not good sometimes) be really great by accepting unacceptable behavior (lying, verbal abuse, disintrest), I do all the emotional heavy lifting b/c I choose partners who are not interested in true intimacy. Some of this shit is really subtle and even not clear to me when I'm doing it. I used to think that love and compatibility were the same thing, and love could conquer anything. They are different things and love does not solve everything.  


So here I am at 44 trying to redefine what 'good' is (and working on myself in a big way)'.  As one of my therapist once put it for me 'I have a high tolerance for bullshit due to my childhood'. I don't want this to be my M.O.  But on the other hand ,the idea of a LTR where there is still love, sex, laughter, trust, common interests and yet ability to be independent, almost seems like a unicorn.    


I recently wrote about how I realized what I wanted in a relationship. But now I'm realizing I actually need to be ready for it in order to recognize it.  Sometimes I think back to men that I dated or knew that had romantic potential and I looked past them possibly b/c they were too ""normal"" and I was used to high-conflict/infatuation/chasing/feeling like something was missing and I just needed to fix it, etc. 

So, good people of Reddit- how do you define a good relationship (thinking about LTR), and in your experience, how did you know the difference between a good ol' infatuation/idealization, and something really healthy and lasting?",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,52581,public,self,Re-framing what it means to be in a healthy relationship: how do you all define a healthy LTR for yourselves?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ogglj5/reframing_what_it_means_to_be_in_a_healthy/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am hoping to get clarity on (if not settle) a disagreement between myself (a lady) and a male friend (""Nigel""). 

Context: he has recently met a lady who he is smitten with and they have been dating. Her boss move was to mention that she has a ""friendship first"" policy. They did that for 2 weeks and are now ""more than friends,"" if you get me.

I've kind of been afraid to express a need/wish/boundary of forming a friendship with a potential partner (recovering people-pleaser here, seeking eventual partnership rather than something sugary that will leave me hungry again in 20 minutes). I tend to be anxious and would rather slow things down and see how I feel. I realized that the current ""hook-up game"" apps don't work for me (because they weren't meant to).

I've also been quite heartened to read on several guys' profiles that they are seeking a platonic connection first, friendship, slow dating, you name it. 

So, I mention to Nigel that I dropped a ""friends first"" request into the convo of a first date recently (for other reasons there won't be a second date: he wants kids, I do not). Nigel reacted, but in an outsize way which made me think he had been triggered by his lady's boundary-setting or something (he thought I should massage my phrasing more to make it more palatable, 'nonsense' I thought). My date seemed unbothered by my request.

TL;DR: I am super wondering: (1) how have you successfully navigated the ""friendship first"" boundary (on your profile, on your dates?) regardless of your stance pro/against, and (2) have we fully euthanized the friend zone yet? 

Please be kind - real person here.

We all have areas of weakness and self doubt.  When you love someone, you should support your partner in the things they feel good about, and boost them up where they may struggle.  I’ve seen confident men that when times get difficult, they simply run away.  Especially when it comes to sex. As we age, sex may not happen as easily, and stress is a huge factor.  Learn to communicate your needs and desires, and if your partner has difficulty here, open the door.  Learn to talk about sexual desires, dysfunctions, or dissatisfaction. Be open with your partner about what’s bothering you, even if it IS about them.  They can’t improve in areas if they don’t know it’s a problem.

3. Our nationality I'm from UK and he is European 
4. He has a child aged 9 and me my son is grown at 22!🤣 as I had him at 19 years old with some additions to the family, we haven't introduced everyone yet but maybe if things go well we want to do this at some point.

Has anyone experienced many differences.  For me I'm okay with everything and I'm always lightly and gently opening up conversation about these things and he to is asking questions about race and certain things he sees at work, which is really good that we are open.

I asked him if he is okay with my age difference because if he wants more kids could come up in the future?, but I'm trying to be realistic as well about my age and having a family and that potentially this may not be easy, anyway cut a story short he just sort if explained his take on things perfectly reasonable.

On the whole we enjoy our company and just enjoy and no pressure is felt and we feel free, so this issues is defo not on our minds all the time,but facing friends, family and the outside world could be a challenge.

So, I thought this might be interesting: what would you change (if you could change anything) that would make online dating better for you, enjoyable for you, or even successful for you?

I wish I could make people stop with the assumptions. I have mostly female friends, and the most common one I hear is if a guy doesn't have a job, they assume the worst. I usually respond with ""so.... you've never been unemployed before?"" As far as I'm concerned, if a person is unemployed yet has a very recent career, and is clearly taking steps to somehow ensure they are not reliant on anyone, then it shouldn't be a problem. 

Same with profiles. ""Oh, look at his profile, he's boring."" Maybe he just doesn't know how to write a profile... much like the rest of humanity.

When I go out to pick flowers out of a tree, I don't tell the tree ""oh, your flowers are not purple enough. Grow a flower that's more purple."" If I truly *want* freshly pick flowers, I go outside, I see what's there, and just select the one I like the most. 

This is what I think is missing from people these days. Everyone has their laundry list of qualities they *think* someone must need so they can have a successful relationship. They no longer seem to be looking at the other person and considering ""can I have fun with this person?"" The interesting thing is the same people with these laundry lists are the same ones failing at relationships, but they don't seem to notice the connection.

My summary: What would you change to make online dating better specifically for you? For me, I want people to be more accepting of others, not to be so judgemental and get out of this mindset that they have the exact formula for how to get a great relationship. Because the data is showing, they really don't know what they are doing. They need to calm down, relax, and give people a shot.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,52665,public,self,Online Dating Solutions?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/oh08qb/online_dating_solutions/,some_ads,7,628375fa-4425-11e9-9805-0e7c3aad8200,Discussion,,,,,,,,,,

He’s very kind. He’s divorced. He has two kids. From what I gathered, he’s only ever been with her. It’s not amicable, and it sounds like he’s over it. He’s been on a few OLD dates, and said they felt like job interviews, with me it was easy. 

We had a really nice dinner. Conversation was easy again, and he told me straight out that he likes me a lot. Asked what I’m looking for. I’m at the home stretch in my divorce. It was toxic and emotionally abusive. I told him I like this. I like how natural and easy it is. Maybe I should have asked him. 

We went to an outdoor beer garden, listened to live music. He asked if he could kiss me. Played with my hair. Was affectionate. I dropped him off at his apartment and we made out in the car for 10 minutes. I got lost goin home because I was dizzy happy. 

He texts me the next day, and when I said how nice it was last night, and that he’s a good kisser, he said it felt like a dream and it’s nice to have things to look forward to. That was at noon yesterday. Didn’t hear from him anymore, unless today when I sent him a playlist he asked me to make him. He said, “thank you. I’ll listen tonight.” That’s it. 

We don’t have plans for a third date. I have a 7 year old and it seems like our custody schedules are opposite each other’s. There’s no texting. No calling. No nothing. It’s like the dates are romantic and easy and then poof. I had to ask about the second date, I’m not asking about a third. So of course, despite everything he said to me about liking me, I’m questioning everything I said and did. Telling myself he’s not interested. I’m sad! Ugh after two dates, and I rarely feel that much of a connection with anyone.

So anything you say or do, if they get offended, then point the if finger at you and accuse you of being BS. So they walk away. Men who are single and have always been single, no long term relationships, no kids, often love their single life, they are serial daters and are simply looking for something better, gosh....they just don't know what it is??? Hence, why they are single in their forties. You have the broken men, be careful of these ones, they have become the love bombers, these are the ones that will jump in and believe you are the one, then quickly jump back out of it and blame the hurt and pain from the past relationship(s).

Been seeing each other for a little over a month. She had mentioned early in our dating that she had trust issues (from past experiences) and would not know when or if she would be ready for sex. I was okay with that. Willing to take our time and go when she was ready. Yesterday, we practically spend the whole day together hiking. I made dinner for us later that evening and afterwards, things got hot and heavy.  She finally let me know that she was ready for sex. Despite the wonderful news, it caught me off guard because I simply wasn’t expecting it. Things got hot and heavy. We were in the middle of making love when, during a position change, I lose my erection.  When it happened I was in a bit of a shock. I am super attracted to this woman in many ways. I could not understand why this was happening. I apologized. She said it was okay, that it happens. But later, while cuddling, she was thinking it happened because I wasn’t attracted to her sexually.  My heart sank because that was simply not true.  She is amazing in every way and I am incredibly attracted to her physically. 
In trying to make sense of why it happened, I recapped the events of the previous day. I should mention that I take pretty good care of myself. I exercise almost everyday and eat healthy. 
So the evening before we made love (sorry, it just sounds better than saying we had sex), I did a grueling workout of squats and lunges and masturbated before I went to bed. The next morning she and I did 2 hikes that involved a lot of stairs on one hike and traversing rocks and changing elevations during the second hike. By midday I was already feeling tired, but got talked into running a couple of miles with a friend of mine. Afterwards, I drank a strong coffee to help me energize for my date later that evening. 
I’m thinking my performance issue had something to do with being exhausted and having previously masturbated the night before, but I’m not a doctor and feel like I’m just making excuses.  I do feel incredibly embarrassed. I like this woman a lot and care about her.

Thank you for sharing! I am looking forward to sharing my experiences as well. 

I have been divorced for 5 years and rebounded into three more relationships immediately following the end of my 17 year year marriage (we have had two kids together: who are now 9 and 17.) There has been a few other little flings in there as well. 

I know I should have taken more time to heal and focus on me during this time but instead, I convinced myself that I had found the “love of my life” a mere 8 weeks after fleeing my emotionally abusive marriage. Even with many friends suggesting that I might be rebounding- I was like a child with my hands over my ears during that time and was determined to learn things the hard way. So that’s what I did. 

That being said, I did learn a thing or two from those experiences and am currently working on truly focusing on myself so I don’t jump into another relationship that is not based in reality. ☺️

I am currently single (again). And for the first time since my divorce, I think I am actually feeling like I may be moving into a space where I will not be rebounding or just looking for a FWB situation. I am also thinking there is a good possibility I am still not ready for a serious LTR since I have spent a lot of time the past five years distracting myself with rebounding. So I thought this might be a good time for me to listen and learn from my community and do a little research! 

I am hearing that Bumble, Tawkify and perhaps E-harmony can be good….anyone willing to share some feedback?

I am not ready to create a profile yet but am excited to learn what you guys think of the various OLD sites.

This is going to be a truthful
And emotional post. Thank you for allow me to share here. ❤️

I have been divorced for 5 years and I have a very ingrained pattern of rebounding since I left my marriage of 17 years. 

Within 8 weeks of leaving my marriage, I convinced myself I had found the “love of my life” with a man I barely knew that lived in Belgium. We then embarked on a three year long distance relationship based mostly on vacations but  not based in reality. When I realized he was never going to take the steps to move closer (and he was a nightmare around my kids), instead of facing reality, I began a 2 year affair with a man already in a long term committed relationship with his GF of 7 years. Again, at the onset of this , I convinced myself that we had “magic” and that it was “cosmic” and that he was absolutely the one and only love of my life. 

His GF eventually found out about us, he landed on my doorstep and I allowed him to move in with my and my two horrified daughters. Within a short time this fell apart too and I swore I would never do anything as crazy again. 

A few months after this break up, I met another man on FB and we embarked on a rather secretive and highly dysfunctional relationship due to him being a Jehovas Witness (he was constantly trying to indoctrinate me) and since it was during the pandemic, and we technically were supposed to be in isolation, I kept him a secret. It was all very stressful
And finally we broke up as well. 

I’m realizing today they It is feeling like it is practically impossible for me to be alone even for 5 seconds to collect my thoughts and focus on truly healing. And what I invite into my life is stressful, time consuming and  unsafe. 

I have a lot of childhood trauma issues that I have have been in therapy and coaching for for years and I do feel I have made some progress with this. I also have a background in counseling myself byt even with all
This support, I am pulled very hard to constantly reach out for someone, anyone, and then it’s like I enter a fantasy place where I convince myself, this is the “love of my life” and I have somehow “finally” found him. 

Two weeks ago I had a dating profile up on FB dating and within a few days of meeting this man , he and I decided we were in “relationship” and making all
Kinds of long term plans together. A few days in i found out that he was married. 🤪. 

I struggle to share all this because I know at a cognitive level, I  have not allowed myself the time to properly heal from my divorce and I am then moving things too fast with men I barely know. And it is a repetitive pattern. Obviously. 

Thanks for listening. The good news is that I have managed to keep the subsequent dysfunctional relationships following the live  in BF away from my kids. I also have owned the harm I caused them and my relationship with my daughters feels in many ways stronger and more authentic than it ever hash 

So some things have improved. 😉

But I am really questioning what is going on with me especially following last weeks experiences….Because frankly, that felt a bit nuts…

So I landed on the side of giving her the benefit of the doubt and a bit of ""what do I have to lose?""  

We went out last night, ended up hanging out for 3.5 hours and it was pretty fun.  She was cool and smart, sorta cute.  Talked my ear off, which is fine since I am on the quiet side.  

Turns out I had nothing to worry about with the in shape thing.  She's in good shape for her sport but it doesn't mean she's got some objectively attractive body.  Dunno how else to put it without sounding bad.  

In the end I got the feeling that she was into it more than me and I am not sure I want to be anything more than friends with her.  

We talked a bit about online dating and our different experiences.  And it dawned on me that she probably was having other dates in between the times we were in contact.  

But what I realized - and this is important, I think- is that who cares if she wanted to see other people while we were not in contact?  I didn't wait around for her.  If she didn't answer a text I was willing to let it go for an extended period.  So if she wanted to come back around and give it a shot, great.  She doesn't owe me anything and vice versa.  

If nothing comes of this interaction I do not consider it a waste of time.  I met a cool lady, learned a lot from her, found a cool place to hang out, and perhaps down the road have made a friend.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,52778,public,self,Update: Just curious how you would handle this,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ohrgwg/update_just_curious_how_you_would_handle_this/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,

I didn't go on a single second date. 

Coffee Meets Bagel: This is my favorite. It sends you a limited number of profiles each day to look through. This is the only site I had relationships through, but the pool is small. Also it skews younger.

Bumble: Too much to filter through. The GPS tracking is creepy. Overabundance of men being interested in polyamorous relationships. Deleted after two weeks.

Hinge: Not bad. Ran out of quality matches after two weeks and ultimately got turned off by a man cat fishing and lack of serious men. Not much information listed on profiles. Deleted after 3 weeks.

I’ve been dating this guy for over a month. We have a great time when we are together. When we aren’t out, he is very busy with his job and social life. Love it. 

Last weekend I was visiting some friends I hadn’t seen in ages. I text him during the day with pictures, I was having such a great time and wanted to share it with him. Radio silence.

The next day I finally asked what was up with his silence? He finally admitted that I text way too much the day before, and I made him feel like I was suspicious of him when I text and asked him where he was headed? Uhhh, ok...?

Didn’t see each other at all during the week. Some texting, now I’m paranoid about texting too much.

We go out yesterday. GREAT full day together. Early on in the date he slickly uninvited me to a family party he is attending in a week. Said he has that family function and they want to keep it small and what should he give as a post wedding gift (the party is for a weddings that happened during covid), was xxx cash amount good since he was going alone? As if he was paying back at least his dinner price. Uh, it’s a bbq at his sister’s house. He is close with his sister. 

It was quiet a few min after that. I let it go and enjoyed the day/night. Great time, even with that uninvite in the back of my mind.

Now it’s the next morning. I know he is up. No good morning text, which he usually does. I even told him I like that.

I think I’m answering my own questions as I’m typing this out. LOL

What is so hard with saying, hey, let’s take step back. Or hey, I don’t think we are a good match. Or hey, my very wealthy sister that I am super close to won’t let me bring a guest to her kids wedding celebration at her house.

We had an immediate rapport and I liked that he (50M) wasn’t being overly charming/smarmy, just normal.  Generally one of us would text good morning and we’d chat (not intensely) but a little bit over the day.  Then once every few days, we’d get into a longer conversation in the evening - anything from 2-4 hours. Other times one of us would be tired and say goodnight after 10-15 mins.  So very natural, easy and nothing too high maintenance or fast moving.

Felt like we were moving nicely towards meeting up at some point and the effort felt quite equal.

Then he had a medical emergency and is now undergoing tests to see if he has long term issues.  Understandably his attention isn’t likely to be on dating with that going on. He apologised quite a few times and I said no worries at all and I understand completely. 

I didn’t hear from him for a few days then I dropped him a quick message to check how he was doing - he read it immediately and replied and we chatted for a few minutes until I had to go.  Then didn’t hear from him for 3 days and I dropped him another quick message - again he replied immediately and we ended up chatting for an hour.  He talked about how he was very worried about the medical stuff and work.  He is definitely very engaged when we do chat and he goes long periods without being on WhatsApp in between.  I don’t get the feeling that it’s due to his attention being on someone else. 

It’s now been another few days and I’m wondering whether to
A) leave him to get back in touch with me as and when (if ever)
B) drop him another message to check how he is doing
C) send a message saying I know he has a lot going on right now that is worrying and I understand if he wants some time to concentrate on what he needs to and if he wants, to get back in touch later on. But that I was really enjoying getting to know him - just recognise that it might not be the right timing for him.

I (40F) own my own house (well... I'm slowly buying it back from the bank, I own about half of it TBH) and my partner (51M) is really irresponsible about money and savings. He was renting when I met him, he is always in debt etc. It is the main thing we argue about but I've just had to learn to keep our finances totally separate because he's a nightmare where money is concerned and can't be trusted.

Anyway... we've been living together for about 18 months now, and in our country after 2 years of living at the same address something called a ""De Facto"" law kicks in where you are treated as if you are married, even if you're not. I hate this law, I feel like unmarried people should be left alone to do our own thing and if we wanted all that legal interference we'd get married, but that's the law and sadly I can't change it.

I also don't really understand it all because I don't see how it's different having a lodger who pays rent to the homeowner, or having a partner who pays me rent because it's my house and he's living there, but apparently it is different (because we have sex sometimes apparently, how is that different to a FWB-type lodger???) and I have to have a legal contract drawn up, which my partner has to sign and agree to, to protect my property in the event of breakup.

Here's where it gets murky. He doesn't want to sign up. I guess if I was him I wouldn't either because technically in about 6 months he'd be entitled to a share of my assets if we broke up even though he has contributed zilch. I've been to a solicitor and it's going to cost about $4k for me and about $2k for him to make this agreement because he has to see an independent solicitor (he can't use the same lawyer as I do) and he's essentially signing away his rights to my property and assets.

He said he doesn't want to, it's an unnecessary expense for him. My bestie is a family lawyer and she said I should just pay his expenses myself to get him to sign the agreement, she told me to look at it like an insurance for my house and my savings and super which will be worth it in the long run.

For me, the online dating thing is a double edged sword. You obviously have more visibility and can show your strengths and market yourself any way you want depending on who you're hoping to meet. Similarly, you can browse other singles in a manner not unlike online shopping. With any sort of online purchase I make I like to check user reviews and ratings. That's not an option with OLD.

And I’m now married (one month), but this is where I’ve come before with advice on my partner’s ex girlfriend. 

They lived together for 3 years, then on and off for 2 years. They don’t have children together. They never married but she desperately wanted it. Begged him to propose, but she had huge insecurity issues and would email his coworkers telling them to not contact him- even for work issues. She caused a lot of work problems for him. 

My problem is- she won’t back off. My husband has ignored her in the past, but he recently emailed her- asking her to stop engaging his son (14) on social media. And now she’s posting old pictures of his son on social media. Seems so crazy to me! She won’t back off!

Since I’ve been with my boyfriend-turned husband (19 month journey), she has emailed him and texted him trying to stay friendly. He shut that down once we became serious. They had a horrible break up and he didn’t want anything to do with her.  Then she turned to the son. Asking to go out to eat with him- my husband declined it. Then she started sending selfie’s of herself in bars to the son. What 40 year old “motherly” influence does that!! My husband blocked her from the sons phone snd told him no more contact. I’ve been married to him for one month and in that time-
She keeps finding son on FB and Instagram and adding him. My husband blocked her on both accounts since. Then he emailed her. Telling her - enough. Move on. Leave me, my son and my family alone. He threatened a restraining order- do to the inappropriate selfies she sent - drunk and scandalously dressed. 
Then She has mentioned him on a mutual friends FB.

It's been about 6 months since we met and 3-4 of which we have been serious.  (We actually knew each other for a year but only met in person 6 months ago). We are somewhat long distance right now but he is all set to move to my city in the next 6-8 weeks.  He has a great job here but lives about an hour and a half away right now.  We typically only see each other for a few hours one night during the week after work and have a sleep over on the weekends.  It's tough sometimes and I get lonely once in a while but we're winging it pretty good!

He works a LOT of hours both in and out of the office.  He also takes on a lot of side jobs and as a result is spread quite thin.  Like this dude packs 37 hours into a 24 hour day.  I don't get impatient or jealous or pouty about it because I respect how much is he trying to come up (for lack of better words). He never leaves me feeling lonely or forgotten and we text often.  This man lifts me up every day, seriously - he is such a hugely positive influence in my life.  I know it's foolish to attribute happiness to another person and I won't do that but I have to say he came along at a time in my life when I was at my lowest, never judging me.  In the past few months I have transformed as a human and feel so excited about who I am and where I'm going.  I did that for me and I'm proud as shit.  But a lot of that was inspired by my man's gentle encouragements and this incredible way he has of talking me through my bullshit.

He does all this while being a single Dad of a teenager! A very good one too, devoted and loving.  His son is a respectful and brilliant young man who I get along fantastically with. 

 We all have ugly moments and get frustrated but I have yet to see my guy become flustered, impatient, agitated or angry.  He keeps his cool in the toughest situations and is so patient.  Even during the couple of times I got a little bratty with him over something petty he was super chill about it and he has this way of talking sense into me that's so respectful and never condescending.  He says this is from his time in the Marines but I think he's just genuinely a strong minded person!

He makes probably 3 times as much money as I've ever made on my best days and has never made me feel like less of a person or some bumpkin ass girl from the hills (which I kinda was til moved to the city in the spring, off a 50 acre farm in an extremely rural area).  When we're together we talk for hours and hours til we lose our voices.  It's like we can neither one get enough of learning about each other's lives and dreams.

So I guess the TLDR version is I have a man in my life that is absolutely a dream come true and every day I go to bed feeling loved and cherished.  To put it bluntly I am so fucking overwhelmed to think I have this amazing person supporting me and am free to love him back shit tons. He goes out of his way to care for me emotionally and physically (the dick downs make me forget my own name sometimes, holy shit!!!).  How do I tell him this and what can I do for him to reciprocate all he has done?  I want him to feel appreciated and respected every night when he falls asleep.  I don't have much money as I'm waiting to start my new job and we live somewhat LD for the next 6 to 8 weeks.  I'm crying typing this out fully realizing how much gratitude and respect I have in my heart for him.  Maybe this is love?  He hasn't said it but I FEEL loved.
