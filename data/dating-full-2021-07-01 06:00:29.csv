To let go of the past and let someone in.  
I spent my youth, my boyhood, dreaming of someone to hold and by held by.  
Someone to love and to love me.  


I always dreamed of being able to lie next to someone and tell them everything.  
To look in their eyes and see them looking in mine and know they see me.  
They really see me.  
But that can't happen anymore.  


Because like all the ones I've fell for before.  
I'm just a ghost now.  
And when I needed someone the most, they weren't there.  
Why?  


I was a sweet kid. I was kind and I was perfectly nice.  
So many abusers and cheaters who ended up with the ones I fell for.  
While I was passed over and rejected and left behind.  
And I've never felt someone's warm embrace.  


What was so wrong with me?  
And now I find myself with my instruments playing on solemn nights.  
Showing talents and with modelling as a new professional delight.  
And glares and touches come my way.  


And I just brush them off and let them slip away.  
They come up to me and touch me, unsolicited and try to take something.  
Not noticing, or caring, about how I wear a special ring.  
My promise to one day give someone special, devotion and everything.  


But I don't think there is someone anymore.  
Because she'll never know and she'll never really see the true me.  
She wasn't there when I was a boy, when I was a loser, no one wanted me.  
And she'll never be able to see all I endured.  


She'll have been someone who was wanted and desired and had people.  
While I never was and won't know how to deal with it.  
Won't know how to stop the envy and the jealousy and the resentment.  
Unfair and unreasonable but there nonetheless.  


I won't know how to trust her and how to let her in.  
My only company is myself and I don't know how to change it.  
All I ever wanted was someone who sees me.  
Not everyone seeing my shadow.  


How do others deal with it? What changed?  
The schoolmates I grew up with have grown and matured.  
In the mental place that I was when I was half their age.  
And finding the empathy I had back then when they were kicking me to the dirt.  


And I had no one to care for me but my slowly building rage.  
I don't want it.  
But I don't know how to let go.  
I don't know how to stop the fear and the resentment and the envy.  


I don't know how to let someone in again.  
I don't know how to stop asking the questions of why I was always passed up.  
Why I was always hurt and unnoticed at best and rejected.  
And why I was always left behind, why I didn't deserve someone before.  


I don't know how to respond to someone's question of what they could do to convince me.

All of those shows are done so I have slowly given them up.

The only 2 Disney Channel shows I was really into were Phineas and Ferb &amp; Milo Murphy’s Law. Both of those are done too, so I gave them up too.

I also used to watch a show for preschoolers called Olivia, which was based on the books by Ian Falconer. I gave that up as well.

I didn’t watch Cartoon Network all that often, the only show I watch there is Rick and Morty.

Since 2016, I have worked at giving up any TV show that is childish for someone my age to be watching. I have replaced them with shows that are more appropriate for my age.

The only remaining show for children that I still watch is SpongeBob SquarePants. I originally intended to watch it until it was over, but the problem is that that’s 90% of what I watch when it’s on Nickelodeon (which I have tuned out of while I do my send-off marathon on a streaming service). I felt like I was watching it just because it was still going.

I will stop watching SpongeBob at the end of September of this year. After that, no more kid’s shows. I can watch animated shows but they can’t be for kids. I will be replacing SpongeBob with Friends because it’s a show that a lot of people my age can relate to, and I’ve heard great things about it even though it’s over. My stepsisters, who are slightly older than me, went to the Friends reunion. I wouldn’t have been able to relate to it because I don’t watch the show yet.

Hopefully when I give up SpongeBob, the last remaining kid’s show in my life, I will attract someone who doesn’t want to be with a man who watches cartoons for children. I believe that watching those shows tells women that I am immature and can’t support myself.

Women are also attracted to strong men who will protect them from grotesque or horrific scenes. I watched the first 2 episodes of Game of Thrones, another show that’s not for children. I’m kind of squeamish so I need to man up and not look away from the screen whenever there’s nudity or violence on the screen. Looking away shows weakness in my opinion and no girl wants to be with a man who’s weak.

I need to stop acting like a kid and start acting like a man. I need to give up all the kid’s shows because it’s unattractive to women, and a man who can stomach nudity and violence and watches shows that are relatable for his age group is attractive.

I’m not trying to over generalize an entire group of people, but these are my observations from my own personal experiences dating Indian and Pakistani men. Im a white woman, who was born and raised in Canada. While in university, I met a close friend of mine, who moved from India to Canada for her studies. Long story short, we spent a lot of time together and through her I met my ex-boyfriend who also moved from India. After that relationship ended, her and I continued to hung out, which was how I met my other ex who was Muslim and from Pakistan. During our time together, we spent a lot of time with his male friend group that were also Pakistani. 


- Men who were born and raised in India or Pakistan, do not adhere to North American dating customs. Arranged marriages are still quite common, therefore they likely see you as a fun meantime thing.

- There is a high probability that their family will not accept you because you’re a woman outside of their culture, caste, religion, etc. A “love marriage” could happen, but typically marriages are arranged to form alliances between families and have the potential to make or break a families ‘reputation.’ 

- If he is even *willing* to consider a serious relationship with a woman outside of his caste and/or religion, he could be alienated if not outright shunned by his family.

- Since a fair share of marriages are arranged by a ‘couples’ family, physical intimacy prior to a serious commitment and/or marriage is looked down upon and sex is heavily stigmatized. 

- Indian and Pakistani men intentionally “date” women outside of their cultural and/or religion, because some of them view western women as easy. One guy literally said they “use” white women cause his “kind” of women would never engage in *those* kind of activities.

- Misogyny is rampant, the amount of cruel comments that were said in regards to my own and other women’s body were astounding. Women are responsible for all of the house work and cater to their partners.

When my mother and sister got into an explosive fight, I left the house (I had the misfortune to have been visiting). The first thing I did when I got back to my apartment was call him. He came over, bearing consolatory chicken bowls from Chirp (this bomb ass Peruvian place). We watched Futurama and I cried in his arms. He ran his fingers through my hair and hummed Bruce Springsteen. I’ve been talking to him very frankly about my breakup with my ex, and he’s been telling me horror stories about his previous breakups. We’ve only been seeing each other for a few weeks, and I don’t know if it will ever evolve into anything serious, but I’ve open-mouth sobbed in front of him already. That might be something. 

I love it when he holds me. It’s warm. We like to spoon. He smells earthy, in a nice way. I tell him he smells like a poetry slam. He likes kissing my neck, although it always tickles. I love kissing his. We play footsies occasionally, underneath my sheets. I love feeling his breath on me. The other day we both woke up earlier than we typically do, and looked into each other’s eyes. He kissed my nose. 

He took a picture of me watching Futurama on another one of our Futurama trysts. It’s too early to call him my man, but it’s the kind of picture your man takes of you after sex. I’m smiling, broadly. I’m generally self-conscious of my smile, but I’m beaming here. My titties are proudly displayed, and I’m lying on my side. He told me he needed to take a photo of me in that moment because I looked beautiful. I felt beautiful. 

We have gotten into one argument and it was about cancel culture. He was arguing it was unfair to men, and doesn’t let them grow. I agree that sometimes it tends to be absolutist and that people are complicated, but this was a conversation about Shia LaBeouf. 

I usually identify as straight edge but I indulge in a little acid once a month. We took some together and visited a few food trucks. I had the most intense tacos I’ve ever had in my life.

First time posting here.
And, obligatory notices : 
1. English is not my native language, so please do forgive me, if I had made a few mistakes in my post
2.  A long post 

I am a 25 M, obese, brown, with okayish facial, physical features. Reddit rated me 3 - 3.75. I am naieve and not so good with social skills. But I do fix myself up well, stay well groomed and make sure to smell good.

Recently, I had started a new job in another part of my country far from hometown. New people, new culture and, to add on to that, an entirely new language.
I went on a date with an attractive coworker of mine a couple of hours ago. It, kinda, went okay. But at the end it just didn't feel right.

So here is what happened.

I met her about a month ago. I got to know her a bit. We had a lunches/dinners together a few times. But it was like a work lunch. She was cute and witty. A couple of days ago I mustered the courage to ask her out. She said yes. 

Today, I took her to an upscale restaurant overlooking the sea. The place was ecstatic. We had the whole rooftop to ourselves. We shared a meal and a mocktail. Some casual conversation. Clicked some pics (they had a photo booth). 

Then it started 
She pointed at a guy in beach and said 'he looks hot, and he can pull off your look (my attire) way better ', in a ""supposedly"" joking way. After a while, she started talking about her ex and how she's not looking for a relationship right now or anytime in the future. Lastly, the worst thing, she started making fun of my weight. I didn't like that quite a bit. I calmed myself and stated that I don't appreciate her making fun of my weight.

Then we finished off the meal with an oreo based dessert. (I learnt that she liked oreos, a lot). When the check arrived, she did make a gesture to pay for the meal (kudos to that). I paid for food. Finally, she wanted some good photos on the beach side. We clicked some. That's when the restaurant staff delivered the chocolate covered oreos. (I requested them while paying the check. Even though they didn't have any, they procured it on my request. hats off to them!). She was surprised and happy. Seeing that, I was happy. We took a cab to the nearest subway. Even on the way back she was cracking some fat jokes. I had one of her favorite chocolate as a parting gift. I said ""I had a great time today, we should do this again sometime, blah blah the generic post date jargon."" She just nodded her head, gave me a hi fi. (I was like wtf). Then said that the chocolate might melt and ruin her purse in the way home, and that I should bring if to our work place so we can share it together. Maybe she realized my facial cues, that I wasn't happy with her response. She then gave me a sideways hug, like the ones where you distance yourself from the person and kinda sideways bow in to give a pat on the back. We, then, parted our merry ways.

At the end of the day, I am half out of my weakly paycheck, more insecure about my weight, sad and dumb. I just kinda feel nothing, definitely not happiness, you know? Like feeling empty. 
I would never get such a hottie to ever go out with me, in my life. But I didn't like the date. 

I would really appreciate some words of advice. Especially on what should I do now?  how should I proceed? Should I go for a second date?

I’m never into it when I try, so I just have given up for the past year or so. COVID was my free pass to wave the white flag indefinitely.

In the past (prior to my 4+-year relationship with my ex), I had an anxious attachment style where, while I was dating someone, I was just full of anxiety if I couldn’t outright tell that someone was interested in me. 

Before my ex, I saw a guy for about 6 months. He was a great guy. We worked together at the time (made the ending so much sadder than it had to be for me). He was the first person I ever dated who seemed NORMAL. He didn’t have any drama in his life. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop; but he was just pretty amazing. I had a history of dating people who weren’t the most stable before him, so I guess I just didn’t know how to handle someone so normal and healthy. The only thing that seemed off to me was his relationship with his ex — who was also dating his best friend — and his involvement with her and her family. This ended up putting the ultimate halt on us and we stopped seeing each other. I was incredibly hurt and felt undeserving of a guy like him.

I remember just constantly feeling anxious if I didn’t think he had interest anymore. We generally took turns arranging plans, so it wasn’t as though he didn’t make any effort.

I remember a similar feeling when I met my ex: the beginning where you feel something is promising, but you can’t tell how the other person feels or if they truly are interested in you.

With both of these guys, I would put off making other plans in hopes they’d want to see me in the beginning stages (LAME).

I can only imagine that meeting someone I’m into now, even in my 30s, would spark similar anxieties.

It feels like everyone I've ever talked to or dated has somehow made my race into a big deal, and I'm tired of it. I'm half korean and half white, and I think this is seriously starting to give me baggage when it comes to dating. I don't know if it's just because of the area I grew up in, but it feels like it's only a matter of time before a guy that I start talking to ends up saying something with weird racist undertones or just straight up fetishizing me. Why does my race even have to be brought up at all? I kinda knew it was just dumb guy shit back in middle school and even high school I let it slide a bit and thought that maybe they were just ignorant. In college, I was just completely over it, and I was hoping guys would be more mature by then. Umm no. I'm in my mid-20s and I still get this. I've had guys ask me a range of offensive questions. I'll list some of the ones that have stuck with me over the years below.


""So, you're Asian, you must like tentacle porn, right?"" That one came from a guy that I didn't even know that well, but was a mutual friend. 

""Wow, you don't even look that Asian. You just look really exotic"". Like, what am I supposed to say to that? 

""Do you go out tanning a lot? I know Asians don't like to tan, but I can tell you would tan really easily and I bet you'd look hot tan"". 


""Have you ever tried dog meat before?"". ""Did your family come over on a boat?"". This one's actually funny. The white side of my family did, but my Asian side came on a plane. 

""I was so surprised to hear that your Asian relatives don't have accents!"". 

""Oh, that must be Asian thing. Most white girls just completely shave themselves smooth"". That was a guy's comment right before sex in response to the fact that I had only closely trimmed myself instead if completely shaving. 


""You have a lot of *oriental* things in your home"".


""Mixed girls are always so hot"".

If not this, I'll have white guys pointing out that they're just soooo white compared to me all the time. Even Asian guys can be annoying though. They always have to point out how white I am, and that I've been white-washed or that I wouldn't be able to relate to something with them because I'm not Asian enough.

My current boyfriend is great, and I love him. We've been dating for 6 months, and he's never said anything like this to me. The other day, out of nowhere, he asked me if I saw myself as more Asian or white. I didn't even know how to respond because it caught me so off guard. I just replied both, because I feel equally attached to both parts of my culture. I don't know if I'm just overly sensitive to comments like this now, but I just feel tired and done with dating. Why is it that as soon as I start talking to someone in a romantic context, my race has to be brought up? My friends have never brought up my race unless it was something innocent relevant to a situation like asking me for good korean food recommendations or asking me to translate something for them.

I (22m) (date 22F)just had one of the best first dates I’ve been had. We met in line at a donut shop on campus, I matched with her on hinge later that week. We talked for a couple weeks and she was incredibly responsive and engaging to my text. We got some drinks at a bar that she had been wanting to try. She was flirty all night, we ordered each others drinks, we were sharing each others drinks, she was constantly asking questions about my job and asking to look at pictures from work (veterinary assistant) and I was asking all kinds of questions about her family and her job. I thought it went so well. We talked until close and then I walked her back to her car, ( we each only had 2 drinks each) and hugged and went on my way. I texted her once I got back home, “just got back, had a great time getting to know you :), have a safe ride home”. She didn’t reply until a day later saying, “Hey, thank you for meeting me for drinks last night! I enjoyed spending time with you! I’m also sorry, but I don’t think I’m ready for anything serious. I’d love to stay friends with you though if you’d like! ☺️”  It just really sucks cause I legitimately thought this was my best date in a long time and she’s literally my perfect type. It’s my first one I’ve tried going on since my ex ended things with me last November. I did tell her I want to be friends and I even told her i wasn’t expecting anything serious yet, I just wanted to get to know her while having some fun. I can understand not being ready but saying that after a first date just makes me feel like she wasn’t feeling me at all, and to just be nice told me to be friends rather than say it isn’t working out.

Remove yourself. Ghosting is so yesterday &amp; immature. 

For context as to why I’m fuming and hurt at the same time. 

I (26f) matched with a guy (28m) beginning of June, we met up on a walk at a park, hit it off very well, talked about movies, hobbies and discussed that we are both looking for something serious and long term. We then talked about having a second date. 

We spoke for a bit more after that before he didn’t message me for 3 days nearly so I unmatched him. Last week we matched again on a different app and hit off again. This time he gave me his number and set a second date quick. Went to his to chill, talk and because we were so tired I started to fall asleep which I said I’m gonna go but he insisted it is ok I stay, he wants me too. So I did. 

I left in the morning. The next day we were messaging and all is going well. We set a walking date for Tuesday evening approximately 7:30pm. He messages me later saying he’s working late until like 9:30 if I can just come and chill again, so got the games and pastries I had ready for us and went to his. Again he said it’s ok I stay over and we are getting on well. 

I’n the morning on Wednesday, we were talking about the walk and he asked me how my day is looking. We pretty much discussed our whole day to say Thursday (today) evening we will go for the walk. Yesterday, Wednesday the whole day he did not message me. I didn’t think too much of it. This morning at 5am I woke up for my morning walk (I naturally wake up early sometimes and I like to go on morning walks) and messaged him if he’s still up for our walk. 

I went on the app (it’s something I automatically do now as I’m actively dating) and saw he’s updated his pictures. I felt shit. 

Anyway, it’s nearly 3pm now and he hasn’t messaged me back.

He could have said by now no or yes. Or that he isn’t feeling or doesn’t think we are compatible. Yes all of these would suck but I really respect honestly and communication. 

I hate how he decided to ghost me. It’s messed up especially how we were planning this walk in the morning together. 

Anyway, I know this is a blessing in disguise as looking back on it I don’t want someone who can’t communicate with me, especially with things that are hard to talk about. 

But dear humans of the world, stop ghosting! Just be honest. It will suck if it’s bad but it’s better than ghosting.

This isn’t to make a pity post. This also isn’t to complain about the fairer sex, it’s just something I want to know if other guys have noticed. I feel like since I was a kid, the importance of my appearance in every aspect of life but most importantly for this post, in dating has been severely understated.

I have always been the ugly fat one, like if I was in a boy band I’d be that one token ugly guy that everyone’s like “Why is he there?” I’ve tried to not let it bother me too much but bullying was RELENTLESS. Honestly I didn’t get a break from it until college and I still caught shit for it until 2020 and I started wearing a mask and hiding from people.

Despite this I didn’t worry about dating too much from messages given to me by my family, friends, and America’s favorite babysitter TV. They always told me that the ugly nerd gets the girl because it’s all about personality and that if I work on myself the good will attract girls. Like look at any romcom from the 2010s. It’s all underdogs getting the girl because of their personality. 

I spent high school and early college working on myself. I took academics very seriously and did so well that I got awarded a full ride to my college where I still make the deans list consistently, lost the weight and got into pretty decent shape, I did a lot of extracurriculars and learned how to play the piano, I also volunteered and did community service as much as I could, I even taught myself how to cook when my parents refused to because I’m an guy.

I’ve always been told that I have qualities women love. I’ve been told by friends that I’m funny, intelligent, hardworking, compassionate and fun to be around and I don’t think they were just blowing smoke up my ass. I haven’t had a problem making friends with girls, but I just can’t even get a first date. When I go on dating apps I get no matches.

I think I rightfully feel like my biggest obstacle is the way I look. At this point I’m not sure what else it could be. The most unattractive features are things I can’t change and when I look in the mirror I just feel hopeless. The constant rejection is slowly tearing down my self esteem.

This may be dramatic but I feel like I was kinda tricked into thinking appearance didn’t matter as much as it does. I have good looking friends that do nothing but drink, party, and barely pass their classes and they do incredibly well and get beautiful girls. Maybe I just don’t see it but I don’t get how they do so well.

i’ve told my counselor about this, he told me to relax, and that this person is in my age group, we’re under 3 years apart and we have a once in a lifetime connection and to cherish it and focus on bettering my mental health. i feel like a piece of shit, i don’t want them to think i’m a horrible person, which i don’t ever think they could, but i don’t want them to see my as something horrible when i wasn’t tying to be that at all. even typing this makes me fucking sick, i feel horrible. 

everyone i have asked about this has told me to relax and that my situation was entirely okay. none of our friends said anything, nobody said anything at all. she is more advanced than i am, nobody has ever said anything, anyone i’ve ever asked had told me i’m overreacting entirely, but to me it doesn’t matter. i want to kill myself because of this.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,871746,public,self,i want to hurt myself because i dated a 16 year old at 18/19.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/obmqp7/i_want_to_hurt_myself_because_i_dated_a_16_year/,all_ads,6,,,,,

A few weeks ago I posted about how I confessed that I liked one of my closest friends.  But she has a boyfriend who is also a friend of mine. 

I was just lonely and didn't think anything of it. But then a week later she told me she felt for me too and because of her relationship that meant we had to stay away. 

Fast forward we started getting really close to each other. And she genuinely made it sound like she wanted me and was gonna break up with her bf for me. We hugged and pecked each others shoulders, held hands etc. All intimate stuff and nothing sexual. She told me of all the signs in her life pointing to me like seeing my name in graffiti and how random kids at her work looked like my little brother. (to be fair im asian and shes white so maybe shes being racist?) 

She said she wanted someone that would lead her closer to God. I admitted and told her my broken testimony which i thought would drive her away but she said that in all my pain and struggle she could still see God in me.

The time comes, she has to choose. She msgs me telling me she chose me at first but then had to change her mind to fight harder for her existing relationship. I respect that. But I've also been strung along like an idiot here

So I go to her house and try and win her heart back by serenading her. Which pisses her BF off. And now I lost him as a friend. 

Idk what to do or feel. I know it seems like such a TV drama scenario but please. This has been consuming my life the past few weeks, I want some good advice. Whether it be to move on, wait for them to breakup, or how do i handle things with her if they do breakup? 

I did betray a friend here. Her BF looked out for me in my time of need but in my loneliness that I used as an excuse I went behind him and tried to take his girl. But idk. No girl has ever made me feel so loved and so stupid. Yet through all this pain and confusion she's caused me, I still feel love for her. I still want her. Am I dumb? I really just need some encouragement or something I don't know

My emotions have been all over the place. I go from feeling thankful for the pain and love she gave me and then getting mad or sad from it. I don't even know anymore. All I know is this. I want to snuggle with someone I love and hold them close and embracing the calm.

So let me preface this with saying it's only been about 3 days and she recently moved on the 25th. We met on OLD about a month ago and things were doing so well I couldn't believe it. I admit I was skeptical of her even being real with how well we got along and talked and all of that. I went from Bumble to Texting faster than I ever thought possible. We were in constant contact for pretty much all of that month up to her moving. We had even done DnD and Roleplay hobbies together and she had watched me stream a few games and it seemed like we were really going to build a good relationship.   


Come these last few days, she's basically gone radio silence save for a day before the 3 days of silence where we talked a little bit and she assured me she was just busy and she was happy that I was worried. I explained my issue to my friends and they've told me that I'm blowing it out of proportion and I should just relax but I honestly can't help feeling this way. I've been ghosted and silently broken up with so many times it's hard not to feel this way.   


Am I at least a little justified or am I a moron and should wait for her to text me back at least for now.

These are things that I (21F) wish I understood sooner and remind myself of constantly as I navigate hardships in life and interactions with others. Although I am a woman, I feel like this applies to anyone. Please comment any additional ideas that you have helped you grow and mature. Disregard any grammatical errors. 

-1. You are not responsible for other peoples feelings (you can do your best to be considerate and apologize if you accidentally emotionally hurt someone, but their emotional pain is not your problem). 

-2. Nobody Cares: Nobody cares how you dress, how you style your hair etc so do what makes you comfortable. Don’t let others’ opinions of you dictate how you act and express yourself. 

-3. Take yourself out: an excerise in confidence, building self-worth, and a social challenge. Your relationship with yourself is the longest, most intimate relationship you’ll ever have. Invest your time, energy, and thought into that relationship. Be honest with yourself and kind to yourself. Take time understand who you are and why you are this way (therapy is a good way to do this if you can afford it. If not, use journaling to recognize trends in your actions and feelings) 

-4. Don’t pretend to be someone you’re not. Being genuine attracts the right people in your life. Be unapologetically you and people will like you as you are. 

-5. Crying doesn’t make you weak. Sometimes you need a good hard cry to get through something. There is real strength in allowing yourself to fully emotionally feel and react to something (at the right time)

-6. Learn to love to have sex with yourself (aka masturbation) before you have sex with other people. Figure out what you like and don’t like and verbalize those things with your partner. Also be committed to listening to what they want/don’t want.

-7. Things usually aren’t as personal as they feel. You have absolutely no control over someone’s actions or feelings. In dating, if you lose interest in someone without a good reason, know that they can also lose interest in toy without good reason even though it might be painful.

-8. Ask for what you want with confidence (living life passively will make you resent yourself and those around you). If you want a raise, ask for a raise (if you know you are qualified). If you want a date with someone, ask for that date. If you don’t get what you want though, know that the main thing was at least trying. You aren’t always going to get what you want and people don’t owe you that. 

-9. There’s a lot of pressure to date at this age,  if you are actively seeking to date (whether that be casual, FWB, relationship) be clear with yourself and your potential partner about what you want and ask them what they want. Make sure that you are on the same page, even if it causes  an uncomfortable but needed conversation. A lack of communication can cause things to get ugly. If you don’t know what you want then eliminate expectations and communicate your feelings throughout. 

-10. Check in on people from time to time. If an old friend crosses your mind, reach out and ask them how they are. It will make them feel good. Ask your friends if they’re doing okay even if they seem fine. Genuinely ask your parents/siblings how they are.

-11. If someone wants to be with you, they will make that clear. If someone is acting aloof in your presence and not making it clear that they want you, move on to someone who does. You never deserve to feel unwanted by someone. People don’t break up with people they want to be with.

Soo....this was really weird. There's this guy I've been seeing for a little bit and we really click. The first date he took me out to dinner and paid for me, and then he got me ice cream and we went walking around town. The whole date lasted about 5 hours and we were laughing and enjoying eachother the whole time, then at the end of the date we ended up laying in the grass stargazing at a park at around 10pm, and before I knew it we were making out passionately and he slid his hand up my skirt and started...you know. It lasted like an hour and I could definitely tell he was nervous and inexperienced but it was honestly amazing. I've never had an experience like that, and he later he admitted to me that was his first time doing something like that too. Then a few days later we had our second date, he took me out for dinner again and we hung out at the mall just having fun and being goofy. It felt like I was 16 again it was so much fun and we felt so comfortable with eachother. He took me back to his place where I thought we were going to...you know, but then he got really nervous and panicking and told me he was a virgin and scared. He thought he was really small but I felt him and I honestly don't think he is, but when I told him that he didn't believe me. He then kinda had a panic attack, but we ended up doing it anyway and he seemed really ashamed and sad afterwards. I spent the night in his bed but we didn't cuddle or anything. The mood completely changed and he wasn't fun and bubbly anymore but more cold and aloof. We didn't talk for like a solid 2 weeks after that and he said he needs to work on himself and he just wants to be friends, and I said that's fine and we hung out again. This time we went and did some shopping and ran some errands together, nothing romantic. It was nice and laid back and everything was good. When he brought me home we ended up talking about sexual topics, and said he wanted to see me again. Then we didn't talk for a weekend and when i reached out to him he blocked my number and my snapchat. What does this mean? Did I do something wrong?

On being introverted: Most people seem to prefer extroverts, which I can fake, but drains me in a couple of hours. I just love watching shows and anime too much. I find it challenging to go out to random places by myself.

On being black: Most girl seem to prefer white guys or Asian guys (kpop)

On being short (5 feet 8 inches): Most girls seem to prefer guys taller than me

On being balding (since my teenage years *sigh, my luck there): Most girls prefer a guy with a head full of hair

On being vegan: Most people aren't vegan and they don't seem to like vegans. I just do it because I love animals. I grew up with tons of different pets that I loved (including chickens and pigs) and I just cannot bring myself to eat animals having grew up with so many of them as pets.

On not drinking: Most socia activities seem to revolve around alcohol. And I don't see the point on going to bars and clubs if I am not going to be drinking. So my options of where to meet people are pretty limited.

On not smoking: I am missing out on smoking socials like hookah launges and places like that. Also, so many people seem to smoke weed nowadays.

On not being jacked: Most girls seem to prefer guys that are jacked. I exercise, but I cannot achieve the jacked look. I guess that I didn't get the Arnold Schwarzenegger genes...

I also live in a new city all by myself with no friends to invite me to events. And due to Covid, I spent months at my apartment without interacting with anyone in person.

I tried talking to my hallmates which most of them are girls that go to dancing/acting/ liberal arts school nearby, but they all give me this weirded out face if I even look their way. So, since they clearly didn't want to get to know me and I am not an emotional massochist, I stopped even looking their way and I just ignore them now.
So yeah, I am pretty much all alone most of the time. The only people that I see are the people at the apartment gym, and we don't talk to each other, and from my window I can see people walking around the city.

It just sucks being me. Sometimes I wish that I was a white Gigachad. But then, I wonder if I would even like the girls that I would get.

Then I wish that I could just find the right girl for me, but then I wonder if she even exists since I am so different than most.

Then I wonder if I am trying hard enough, but then I think that the only way for me to try harder would be to quit my job and just do hobbies all day to meet people instead.

I think they still like him to be honest or they are at least fond of him. He would text me from time to time and we talked a little but it would always end. I just feel like he is giving me the breadcrumbs to make me fall for him like other girls.

So, recently we kind of started talking. Like not talking-talking but he would say hi and I would say it back.

Thinking of this, I realized there's quite an age difference between that and the 98% of students (18, 19, 20, 21, 22) at universities. This poses a problem in dating and making friends there.

I didn't do that well in high school because I had some mental issues going on. Also didn't look good (I do now). It was a small town of 7,000 too, so if you didn't hunt, trap, or play football (all things my dad wouldn'tlet me do), you basically had no way to shine and be accepted in those small-town cliques, which largely mattered in the pursuit of dating.


 After high school I drifted away from the idea of going to a university. Work made it hard to stay focused on making a college plan and doing all the steps in it. 
But I did get into fitness. I even got so into running at one point that I ran a few half-marathons by myself, just for fun. So I look good now. And from being around some co-workers I know, I'd say my personality is pretty good too. 

But is being 25 seen as too old for someone 18, 19 or 20? Considering that most of these younger students still have a lot of other students their age to date? I look about 19 despite being almost 25, so maybe that would make me not seem too old. 

Would being 25 make me seem too old to make friends there? I never had a decent teenhood, so I want to hang out with people.
