2,o2ezba,1623985150,Should’ve stayed single,"
I’m starting to regret agreeing to be in relationship. It’s still kind of early, so I know adjustments can be made but I don’t want to make a mistake. I’m a very spontaneous adventurous person who loves to have fun. I decided a long time ago to stop dating guys with addictions so meeting my bf was a good match initially. However, as time go by I’m wondering if we are really compatible. I enjoy going out from time to time rather if it’s a lowkey lounge, for a drink, something adrenaline rush oriented. However, my bf is the opposite. He doesn’t like loud noises, afraid of heights, not pressed to travel, and doesn’t like to get lit. In my past relationships I was usually able to do the things I enjoyed with my partner however with him, he declines all the things I consider fun. For example, tonight I just want to go for homemade mimosas, get tipsy, and make out/have sex. I asked him to join and he’s like you can drink by yourself which is his response to a lot of things I suggest for fun. Before meeting him I did things I enjoyed with my prior partners or friends. So I’m not about to do things alone now just bc we are dating. He pushes me to be my best self but I’m afraid I will end up bored with him. Sigh. Idk what to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o2ezba/shouldve_stayed_single/

TLDR; Talked with girl for 2.5 months, started seeing her in person a month ago. Had a few dates, things were going great, she came over to my house for the first time for a few days, we had a really good time, hooked up. Then she left and pulled away. Said she has no idea what she wants.

&amp;#x200B;

So we finally had a bit of a conversation tonight, and basically, she gave the spiel that she ""doesn't want a relationship, doesn't want to get emotionally attached to someone. You're an amazing guy, but I just don't know what I want and don't want to hurt you in the process of finding myself.""

I'm just so fucking frustrated with online dating at this point. I'm a successful, confident guy that brings a lot to the table. I don't know why, but I keep attracting emotionally unavailable women. It's always the same story. We get to know each other, seem to be compatible, have some really great times together, then when things look like they'll start becoming more serious, they get cold feet and bounce.

I know that I have my flaws (like we all do), but I've been working very hard on myself and have been making a lot of progress. I'm just so sick of getting my hopes up just for them to be shattered a few weeks/months later. I live in a small town and it's hard to meet someone around here, so I turn to online dating and have been having equally shit luck.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o2flns/update_she_says_she_has_no_idea_what_she_wants/

my current bf dated one of my friends almost a year ago, but they broke up because this girl cheated on him and broke up with him. but she and him still remain good friends. 

when my current bf and i started dating, i asked him that when he does hang out with this girl, because he works with her and still are good friends, to at least let me know. because i made it clear that i was uncomfortable with the fact that he would hang out with her alone or something and not tell me. and he was like sure ofc thank you for letting me know. and so all is well.

now comes summer. my parents refuse to let me out and hang out with him. so i havent seen him in a good while. he has kind of been distant and we havent talked a lot. weirdly enough, i call my friend today to check up on her and she includes the fact that her and my current bf haven't hung out alot. my protective girlfriend side is like okay good. but then she includes the fact that he asked to hang out with her yesterday, but she was busy.

how should i feel? my bf hanging out with his ex? going out of his way to ask her to hang? and he knows that i cant hang a lot, but it makes me feel so sad.

17,o2g0dj,1623988553,"Has anyone gotten the ""ick"" with a genuinely good person?","I've (f33) been dating a genuinely great guy (m34) for about 5 months. He's kind, considerate, easy-going, secure, humble, smart, has strong friendships, and pretty much every other trait that I would want as a partner. I never felt ""sparks"" with him, but for most of our time together (until recently), I really enjoyed being around him and talking to him, and was initially drawn to his kindness and intelligence.

He's not a model, but being objective, he's about as physically attractive as most of the men I've dated in the past. The sex is not great, tbh, but sex is often not great for me and I have never asked for anything different than what he does so I can't put that on him.

For the past few weeks, I've been feeling like something is off. We're both on the introverted side of the scale, and so sometimes our communication is lacking. And I've found myself increasingly irritated by some really minor stuff about him (I won't go into detail, but none of it is red flag material).

Last night when we were trying to have sex, the ""not right"" feeling become overwhelming. my entire body tensed up to the point where penetration was impossible. I was horrified, but he was fine about it -- we made out, cuddled, and he reassured me that it was no big deal and that we could try again some other day.

I'm not sure what to do. I've never felt the ""ick"" before. I feel like the attraction might be gone, I'm not sure it was ever there.

then we took a little break and i decided i was done completely. i realized how mentally it was messing me up so i was accepting that it was over. fast forward a few weeks and we were back together, at that point, he very clearly felt the strongest feelings for me he had ever felt. i loved it, it was like i finally was getting what i wanted. a year later we are now completely committed to one another, soooo comfortable with each other and happiest as ever.

for some reason i just can’t fully trust him, even though we’ve had these conversations before and i’ve explained how much he messed with my feelings and he’s cried to me how sorry he is and he really really has changed in every way for the better. but i don’t know why i just get sooo anxious every time he’s out and if he’s not responding and if he’s on his phone. like how do i get over this, i have no reason to not trust him anymore.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o2g4q0/i_dont_trust_him/

22,o2gi1k,1623990198,Being attractive / unattractive,"I think men are too hard on themselves when they say they are unattractive and no one likes them. Being attractive might give you a leg up in the dating world, depending on your definition of attractiveness.

So many times I have seen a woman say a guy is cute or good looking etc but not give out her number to him or I've seen good looking guys attempt to pick up girls and get rejected even if he had good game, etc. I'm a generally attractive guy and I've been turned down several times, even after she told me I was cute, handsome, etc. 

The reason is that women are not visually stimulated like men, where men want to automatically date/hook up with every attractive girl we see. They are more emotionally driven. She had to be in the right emotional state. So even if a guy is handsome, she will reject him if she's not feeling it or whatever. 

This is what guys need to understand. I mean yes there will be a small percentage of  girls that will be attracted to you based on how you look but that's very rare, because it's mostly emotional for women. Ive even seen what is considered  average or below average men with beautiful women. I've seen this over and over again.

25,o2gun1,1623991475,"Guy (28M) has texted me (29F) everyday consistently for 2 weeks, suddenly stopped two days ago.","Sorry kind of a long post! But I wanted to include the whole story to help you understand the situation. I met someone through an online dating app. After the first day of msging he started to msg me good morning and texts throughout the day everyday. We have been texting consistently like that for the last two weeks! Sometimes we would even talk on the phone for hours at a time. We also met in person and things seemed great! To put it in persepctive we met after talking for a week, and in the span of another week we saw each other about 5 out of 7 days. He always seemed enthusiastic about meeting up. We live 2 hrs away from each other and half the meet ups he would drive and come to me, so he definitely was willing to put in effort to see me. 

The last time we saw eachother we met up for dinner and it ended kind of awkwardly. The beginning of the date was normal and fine! He seemed happy to see me. It was after we ate and went back to his place things kinda went a little awkward. After dinner he kept saying he was really tired and had a food coma and our conversation kinda dried up a bit. Then when we got to his place he smoked some weed. Which he usually doesnt do until closer to going to bed. And usually he smokes so little I cant even tell hes high, but this time I could really tell he was pretty high. 
So we were watching a show and he sat next to me. Usually even when hes really tired hes very physical and would hold my hand or have his hand on my leg and snuggle closer to me. But this time there was just this gap between us and he didnt try to touch me at all. So I felt kind of awkward about it. There wasnt much conversation happening so I just told him you know your tired so I'm gonna head out. Usually he would walk me to my car but this time he just gave me a quick kiss at his door and said bye from there. When I got home he had texted me apologizing for being a bum. I msged back saying it was fine, but he just seemed so distant at the end of that night that I sent a second text asking if anything had happened because I noticed he was kinda off? He said no he was just tired and didnt have the best day. He said he usually has a routine he likes to follow on weekdays that he tries to stick to. 
I asked one last time if hes sure hes just tired or if I had said anything to bother him? And before he could reply I decided to drop it and wrote again saying never mind, I'm just gonna take his word for it. I thanked him for dinner and wished him goodnight.

The next day he msged me good morning as usual. I was out on a little road trip to the beach so I may not have been as responsive as I normally am but we still texted throughout the day. The conversation was maybe a little mundane just asking about each others day but nothing that bad. 

The last msg I'd asked him what he ate for dinner and he said ramen, and I didnt feel the need to respond to that so I just liked it and left it. Since then he has not msged me once! No good morning texts nothing... it has been two full days with no messages from him. What is going on? Is he losing interest? Should I reach out to him? My initial instinct is to just message him but everyone is telling me that I should just give him space and wait for him to reach out to me. Especially because they found out I was the one who initiated every single meetup. Lol I'm just a very straight forward person so I'm not afraid to be the one to ask the other person to meet up. Apparently this is a bad thing and I made myself too available and that's why this guy has ""pulled back"". Is this true? Or am I just over thinking things? Also might be useful to note I am super new to dating. Been in serious relationshipfors one after the other for the last 10 years. So a part of me wonders if maybe I kinda acted too much like a girlfriend too soon and scared him away lol.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o2gun1/guy_28m_has_texted_me_29f_everyday_consistently/

I’ve not made very good choices in my lifetime and there are times nights get lonely. I’ve attempted dating sites but mostly feel like I’m being desperate and choose to take this opportunity to embrace being content with who I am. I’m a hard worker, a good mom even though I feel I can do better. I’m a grandmother which is really where it’s at lol. To anyone that is struggling with the dating I believe when more than anything that when the timing is right the right person will just appear. That might sound a fairytale and I truly get that. I spent most of life searching for someone that will see my worth and the love I possess to just look stupid and consumed with even more problems. So I’m saying now that maybe the answer is to stop searching. Find out or evaluate past relationships and see if there was something that could have went differently and learn from it. I’m correcting to not be so codependent or look for validation because whoever my person is will respect my mistakes and appreciate me more for the woman I’ve become. I try harder to not expect me from others—easier said than done sometimes. I feel people need to be met where they are at and not have conditions placed that are unrealistic. We all have something to offer but with that all of us are at different points with dreams and goals so we all have the right to say this isn’t my direction but I wish you the best.

A lot of her aesthetic is typical 90s and it also  helps that she worked at Calvin Klein (one of the defining designers of  her time). She wasn't unattractive, but her face was very unusual. She  looked attractive in some photos and not so much in others.

I'm  assuming that she had a great personality. She was the quintessential  popular girl in her high-school and somehow managed to have that spill  over into the rest of her life.

What I'd like to speculate with this post is how she was able to date so many High Value Men (as per Kevin Samuels).

Among  the obvious bagging of America's most eligible bachelor JFK Jr., she  also dated Alessandro Benetton (billionaire heir), John Cullen (NHL),  Liam Dalton (high profile investment banker), Stephen Dorff and Scott  Winters (actors) and various Calvin Klein models. How? And most  importantly, how can find out what she ""had"" and use that to become more  confident and have better luck at dating? (No, I don't aspire to date  rich and famous people, but I don't want to sit here waiting for that  text back---so frustrating!)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o2h685/what_made_jfk_jrs_wife_carolyn_bessette_special/
31,o2h6wk,1623992706,Advice needed,"Alright me and my exgirlfriend broke up almost two weeks ago and I’ve been really going through it. I feel this is my first real relationship as we would have hit 2 years in august. I loved this girl heck I still love her, we had plans of moving into together, getting married and more. During the course of our relationship we had some rough patches. She would be very controlling as she wouldn’t want me messaging people, she’d want anytime I had spent with her so it was hard to just be home sometimes. In the beginning she cheated on me. Then about a year later we broke up for a week because she wanted to “live her life” which she eventually came back to me saying how much she missed me and she realizes that she wants to be with me after a couple weeks. Then we’re here. Lately I’ve felt like the relationship was dying on her part. The sex life was no existent and she started to not be there emotionally! I confronted her and she reinsured me everything is fine that she just didn’t have a job and school was stressing her out. So about a week from that talk we decided to get a dog. This kind of gave me hope because I told her if we get this puppy this is like a next step for us and we got to be serious about each other before we get a puppy. She agreed so we ended up getting a puppy. About four weeks after having this dog she tells me we need to talk and tells me she loves me but she’s not in love with me anymore. This crushed me and I couldn’t really say anything and I just walked out. Now I’m left without feeling without closure and I miss her. So the thing I’m coming on here for advice is what should I do. I feel she reacted quick instead of fighting for us.  I feel like I shouldn’t just give up like this that I should fight for us and our puppy. But I also feel I should give up, move on and experience more maybe something more healthy, but that roads feels so lonely right now.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o2h6wk/advice_needed/
32,o2h7v7,1623992808,When will things ever change?,"
I just wanna talk through this to anyone who might want to listen. I’m so very sad. Literally every one of my (M23) friends is good enough to have a girlfriend except me and I just don’t get it. I spend hours and hours each day wondering and analysing everything I can to find out what’s wrong with me because I wanna be good enough for someone to love me. I work so damn hard at this, tryna dress well, be funny, be fit, be successful, be smart. I feel like that the end of the day I’m doing just as well (or even better if I’m honest) than most of the guys around me on paper, but nobody has ever loved me. I don’t mean it in a bragging way but literally the only reason I worked so hard to graduate from an Ivy and get a great job was because I thought if nobody is ever liking me for who I am, at least they might like me for that. But that didn’t work either and I feel like I’ve just wasted more of my life away.

I just don’t know what to do and I’m not sure if I should even continue living like this or throw it all away and run into the woods and just become a hermit. I’d be lying if I said I’ve never thought of ending my life because of constantly seeing everybody find love while never coming close to it at all myself, though I don’t have such thoughts anymore. Why can’t I just be good enough for somebody at least ONCE?

33,o2haew,1623993075,Went on a date with this guy and I feel like it went pretty well…,I’m 27mvand he’s 30m and we started talking on hinge. We weren’t really flirting we just were talking about our interests and realized we had a lot of the same ones. We decided we would hang out and get lunch the next day. We talked about growing up gay and our childhoods and our lives leading up to Covid…stayed at the restaurant for almost 3 hours talking! I us drove around Hollywood and we kissed here and there and held hands and it was very casual. He was affectionate and respectful and really nice. When I dropped him off at home he kissed me again and had a more intense kiss. He told me he wanted to hang out again soon and asked me to text him once I got home. He gave me one more peck goodnight and we parted ways. I texted him and he told me I had pretty eyes blah blah blah and asked what I was thinking about and I told him just about him. He fell asleep I guess and texted me the next morning apologizing for passing out on me. It’s been about 2 weeks after and he has been really short with me or just won’t reply at all and kind of seems uninterested…I would understand if he wasn’t into me but he hasn’t said anything or mentioned anything about not wanting to see me anymore. I’m not unreasonable and I get some people just don’t vibe with others…I have been told I have a strong personality and that I “suck the air out of the room” so I feel really insecure. He randomly texted me last night asking me if I knew of any bars that did rupauls drag race viewing and I gave him a few and was friendly and all he said was “I appreciate the insight lol” So today I asked if he wanted to hang out not thinkin he would say yes and he did but seemed kind whtever/casual about it. What should I do? Should I back off? And take the hint? Or just ask him straight up if he’s interested in me in that way? I’m confused. Anyone been through something similar?

The one thing that I thought I knew for sure was our love was strong for one another. From the fights physical, mental,and .....  , and the arguments to u cheating on me. We were both in our addiction together  but we found our way to beat it together people saying u will never make it .blah blah .. I knew that as long as I had u by my side. There wasn't anything we couldn't do and  us together was unstoppable love.  
 I have  stuck by ur side no matter what I loved u threw ur worst but now that I'm having a little trouble with my mental health and all . U jumped on the opportunity to kick me at worst make me feel like I'm not good enough to love and be with u at ur best .I could never turn my back on u even though u destroyed my heart and set it in fire . I would stil be here bye ur side if u needed me.

39,o2icq0,1623997002,Love vs Family and cast?,"I met my co-worker a few years ago. I thought she was beautiful from the moment I first saw her. Her shy deer like innocence drew me in.

I tried hard to avoid the complications this 'office crush' would cause.

There was no way she would like me, like that. I greeted her ever so often to be polite but when she smiled, or replied at me my heart would always skip a beat. But I could not help but feel my eyes wander over towards her whenever she was in a room, waiting like a madman for the next moment she smiled, spoke or laughed.

She had completely bewitched me, without even trying. 

Time went by. Eventually the more of her I saw as she joined a department close to mine the more harder it became to not want her. Until I eventually stopped trying. Everything about her was beautiful. Her looks and personality. I felt like she had feelings for me. Because sometimes when I would look at her I would catch her looking at me almost the same way. She always blushed when I spoke to her, Waited nearby for me to catch up to her and always gravitated towards me.

I was right she did love me. I found out from a reliable mutual friend she had confided in.

We never dated. I was happy we both knew how we felt about each other. It was unspoken off but I knew she was mine, when she wore the bracelet I had casually bought for her everyday. Our connection was pure. We would talk to each other for hours after work. We spent all of our time together. She was happy with me. She would laugh at my most awful jokes or stories. She would look up at me with a soft look in her eyes. That drove me insane.

Her family were very well to do. They are a high cast family, our mutual friend said that she felt confused with her feelings for me knowing her family would be against her ever being with me. To the point of disowning her. She never brought it up to me. Almost afraid it would upset me. She knew I liked seeing my bracelet on her wrist and how I felt if someone kept her away from me even for a half hour. 

Everything changed so quickly, her father got sick. She stopped talking to me as much as she used to. And it was something that made me really angry. 

I blamed her father. I cursed at him. He is not a good person. I could derive that much from my conversations with her. She never spoke ill of him. But he emotionally blackmails her often. She had not come to work for a few days, Then there was a company announcement, She was engaged. Everyone distributing sweets in the office and got one there after  someone said shes engaged. I went to her desk. Something I avoided usually. There was a few females all gathered around her, asking to see her ring. She saw me and looked uncomfortable. The mutual friend saw this and asked to talk to me. She said she was sorry and that she did not want to speak to me anymore. Her father wanted her to marry a family friend before he died as a last wish. I was livid. 

I wanted to shake her. Scream at her. Do something. I did nothing. I watched her with disbelief as a month passed.

She no longer smiles like she used too. She barely says a word when I am around. She avoids me. I just want to clarify that it is not her fault her family is like this. Shes a good person. She just loves her family deeply. I despise her family. 

An outdated cast system and emotional blackmail is going to take her away from me. I will never see her again. I heard her fiance wants her to quit working. I wish she would have spoken to me once. That was all she had to do, and I would take her away from all of this. I know I am an asshole for even thinking of asking her to leave her family for me. That is the only way out of all of this. 

If she rejects me it would crush me. 

In my heart I feel that if I asked her to come away with me. She would pick me. She had said before I am her only weakness. That is why she has stayed so far away from me. That is what is making her strong.

tl; dr I love my co-worker and she loves me. Her family is separating us. 

I am 28 m and she is 23 F.

My question is too all of you, would you pick the man you love over the cast system and your family?

41,o2ionm,1623998295,Advice on being optimistic in dating? Or ways other ENTP types stay interested when dating? Have you noticed your best relationships happened later in life?,"So I’m quite young mid-twenties, but I’ve noticed from past experiences I can detach so quickly or get rather bored with dating. One minute I go 2-3 months super excited to meet new guys and go out followed by another 3-4 months of me being totally uninterested in the entirety of it. I know some other ENTP types do this too. Usually I follow my instincts about my attraction to someone but in a recent dating experience I didn’t and it’s left me confused and a bit uneasy. So I’m unsure to listen or not listen to myself now. 
Now I’ve been talking to a new guy for about a month now and we connect so well! However we have yet to meet in person because of schedules and slight distance. His communication skills so far have been amazing, and we’ve had great conversations about our wants and expectations in future relationships. He has made it clear he wants a connection and a monogamous relationship that could potentially lead to marriage and a family. Of course I know it’s super early and we aren’t exclusive but that scared the hell out of me. 
The last thing I’d want to do is hurt someone who has been a doormat in his previous relationships and admits he is finally growing and knowing his worth. 
 I also feel confused because physically he looks the exact opposite of what I’d ever date yet I still feel attracted but not surface level (idk how to explain it). I know I have the tendency to be flighty not a cheater but reprioritize my career over romantic relationships. Anyone else experience these things?

50,o2jp4q,1624002579,"Hello, it's over","Hi, 

I (26M) have 0 direction with this post but I just wanna vent. She (28F) cheated on me 6 years ago, the summer after we started dating during college. She didn't tell me until I was about to move to take classes to prep for med school, which was 3 years later. She was very, very apologetic and I forgave her because she was an amazing partner and we were living together. I eventually got into med school, which she greatly helped with. 

One thing is that she never wants kids, and I do. I don't think we can compromise on this topic. I also fell out of love when I found out about the infidelity, but was afraid to be alone in a new city at the time. I just feel so comfortable with her because we share so much together which includes a house, dogs, interests, etc. 

But I finally realized that the romanticism just won't work out long term. I won't get over the child issue and cheating. I should mention that I have felt love for her, but have never been in love with her. Never had the strong feelings, just comfort and security.

54,o2k265,1624004081,My fiance (27/F) and I (27/M) threw away our engagement after a 2 year relationship. I need to know if I was a toxic person.,"So, we had been together for over 2 years and for the last year, we had been engaged. She decided a month ago that she could not see any future with me. When the relationship started, I wasn't too keen but she was kinda obsessed and even with political and religious differences, she wanted it. The more time I spent with her, the more I realised that this could happen so I said yes. Early on in the relationship, there were some things that bothered me but I wanted only to focus on her. A week after we officially started, her aunt rejected me because of religious differences, but she convinced her. Then, she came to where we worked, another city, just to know me better. 

I found that weird because it was fairly new and I did not feel ready. I knew she would be sad if I said no so I went with it. They said they liked me but other things happened. Like whenever we spent time together at her house, like talking or watching a movie, her aunt would video call just to see if I was there. I would then hide. I started to like her so I kept. my mouth shut. About 4 months later, I had a job offer to another place which had always been what I wanted. But I could not leave her behind so said I would accept it if my girlfriend can also find a job there as well, to which they said okay. 

So, we both started somewhere else. The problem was the new city is only 45 minutes away from where her aunt lives. Not gonna lie, they did. help a lot with the move and such but I knew better than to think it was for my sake. Anyhow, everything was going well and a month or so later we decided to get engaged. Engagement was great but I had my doubts. Not. about the woman I wanted to marry, but how fast things were going. The engagement was her aunt's idea too. The whole ""what would people say?"" kinda thing. So I said yes. Not to mention, after our engagement Covid happened so we stayed mainly indoors and worked from home. 

Our flats were different but in the same building so other than work, we would spent time together. When summer came, we decided that it's best if we cancelled wedding plans and such for some other time because of Covid-19. My fiance was pretty afraid of the pandemic too. And the daily cases were about 3000 or smt. Anyway, with summer the cases declined and we went away on holiday, her aunt and her aunts husband coming with us. Which I did not like. But went with it anyway. She also wanted to buy a car so that we can go to different places during Covid-19. I wasn't sure about this and told her so. Our workplace was very close to where we are, like 5 mins by walk. 

I didn't see the need. Not to mention the pandemic so you can't really go anywhere. She got sad so I said okay. We both took a loan. I kinda paid the 1/3 of the car, which was brand new. Anyway, her aunt also got one. So from this point onward, everything went to shit. I'm sure you guys know how shitty working from home actually is. The fact that we had a car actually meant that she could now drive to her aunt when she felt like it. Which was okay for me but not when they already talk for about 2 hours every night. Like we decide to watch a movie, and halfway through her aunt calls and never once did she decline a call. 

They would talk and I would just wait for it to end. When we started again, she would just fall asleep. Her aunt would come, she would. go to her aunt. This kept on going and I sometimes told her not to do this to much but she didn't care, it seems. So, I started to spent time myself. I realised that I was. losing myself. I started playing video games with some friends. Which I never do as I'm mostly a single player guy. Anyhow, after the new year, she wanted to get furniture as it would be cheap. I said that there's no need atm because we are already paying for the car and that that could be done after we're married. 

She got sad again. I told her a new house is also needed because our flats were small, furnished studio ones. So, as always, her aunt came into play and said it makes sense. We started looking for a house, just for her, and furniture. We got them but could find a house so we rented one in ola building near mine. We started to fight more, mainly because of my work and how I spend my free time. She told me that I wasn't paying her enough attention and that she was doing everything. I always helped her with chores though. Cooking, dishes, taking the trash out, help with cleaning and shopping and such.

Btw she was earning more money than me so she could save it. Most of my free time was either passing by playing games with my friends or just waiting for her to come and do something fun together. She liked going out so she wanted to drive the car around. I said okay sometimes but also told her that if we're going to go out, I'd like to walk and talk, holding hands. We did that once, only once, in four months. When we did it, she got so tired that she fell down and sat somewhere. Like after 10 minutes. The next days I went alone. She started to complain about me sending money to my family and such, whereas I encouraged her to do the same when her family was in need. Even saying that I could do it if she couldn't. Anyhow, I made some mistakes with not paying attention to her feelings. I know that, and I apologised and asked for a second chance. I told her that now the covid is. almost over with summer coming. Oh BTW, I forgot to mention. The main reason I didn't want to go out was because those cases that were 3000 when she was afraid now became 65000 each day. She once felt so bad that I took her to a friend I know and he performed a test on her which was negative. But I was really afraid, genuinely afraid that I started crying after I knew that it was negative. 

Her main points for break-up were that I didn't want to go out with the car much, playing games with my friends and not helping all the time. I say all the time because there wasn't a day where she did all the work. I always helped either by cooking, cleaning or shopping. I also don't have a driver's licence and didn't get one because of Covid-19. So. what do you guys think? I did play games almost every night with friends but this kinda happened when I started to feel lonely. She told me that she was thinking about it for the last 3 months but we only spent less than 30 days alone during this time. Can you guys tell me what I should do to be better? Ask any question you have too.

PS: I lost my mother to cancer 2 years ago so I was in depression and told her so back then. The last few months, I felt the same again, not due to my mother but this time about what I was supposed to do. Told her that I felt depressed but saw that she wasn't interested I guess as she decided to end it like 4 days later.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o2k265/my_fiance_27f_and_i_27m_threw_away_our_engagement/

56,o2kmfq,1624006454,Just uninstalled Tinder. This is my brutal honest 1 year experience,"

**This is for the people, who exclusively date through Tinder and want something more. Please Read!**

I’m a M20 if that matters. I installed Tinder spring last year, and honestly, i’ve quite mixed signals about the whole experience. The reason i uninstalled is i just met someone, we have been dating for some time and i think we’re getting serious… we didn’t meet through any dating apps.

Before you begin online dating, really consider and ask yourself, what you’re looking for: is it a friend? A hook up? FWB? A long term relationship?

Whatever it is, ask yourself that first, and say yeah, that’s my goal. For me, it took me some time to realize hook ups weren’t satisfying and in the long run, i’d rather want to wait it out and look for something serious (which is what i’m doing now, without Tinder).

I wasn’t very active on Tinder, but i would occasionally find someone i found nice and would chat with for some time…

Imo, you should definitely not be on Tinder, if you’re looking for more than FWB. A lot of people don’t take it serious. I get it, in some rare cases, some do. My own mother found her bf 1,5 years ago on Tinder and he’s super sweet. I’m not generalizing Tinder. Not *everyone* is looking for casual, but it’s rare with more.

Keep in mind that i’ve had quite a lot of succes on this app. I’ve personally met a few girls, especially around Fall last year, but it would always end up as a hook up. The girls who wanted more either tried to play hard to get or was really bad at expressing their emotions. Idk if it’s because of my age…? Probably is. 

I seemed to either attract either girls same age as me or max 2 years younger, who were VERY childish High School girls… or i would attract girls same age or bit bit older, who litterally just broke up and wanted a Quick fuck.

I especially remember one girl. I actually knew her through my Old High School. I actually had a crush on her and i think she’d too. We had one date. Again, a girl who was just childish, and couldn’t express her feelings/seemed so weird about dating in general. Ofc that was a dick move by me but i ended up ghosting her (i would not do that again tho). But she was just so bad at communication, i couldn’t stand it. Then half a year later, like maybe 1 month ago she ask me how i’m doing, we should meet up and she missed me and what not. Tf? So weird.

**Summary:** Tinder - if you ask me - is a ‘dating’ app, that should be used for you and your friends to find local parties with single girls and easy hook ups while you’re single. Tinder is a perfect post break up thing. Having some fun. Nothing more, nothing less.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o2kmfq/just_uninstalled_tinder_this_is_my_brutal_honest/

We have gone on a date every week since then, sometimes twice a week. In total we have met up 17 times. We have kissed. I haven’t slept with him, because I am a virgin and i want to only sleep with someone who I really like. Well I do really like him. I have never met a guy who I actually liked as much as I do him. I think he is incredibly attractive and we get on intellectually too (which is super important to me). Anyways, on the fourth date I told him that I am a relationship person and that thats what I am looking for. He told me he wants something casual but is not ruling out a relationship if that’s what happens. Anywho, many dates / weeks have passed since then and I asked him last week what we are. He couldn’t tell me. I told him that I want to be in a relationship with him and he says he has anxiety when it comes to relationships and he is afraid. I know he isn’t seeing other girls, we already established we were not going to be seeing other people after the 6th date.  
I can see myself losing my virginity to him. Heck, I already got on the pill for it (I would like to be double secure). But if he can’t commit to me , after three months? You should know if you want to be with someone after three months right ? 
I mean granted, he was never in a relationship before. I get it, he is scared, but I don’t know whether i should wait around for him. 
Please give me some advice. 
I really like him, I think I am already falling for him.

**Context:** I've been dating a friend of a friend. She is awesome in all senses, she has a great personality, is smoking hot and gorgeous. We are not oficially a couple. However, I know that our common friend may has a crush on me

The girl I've been dating, told me that she thought my friend had a crush on me and if this was real, we would stop dating because it was our friend, we both agreed, our friend goes first. The problem is that I had a crush on my friend a long time ago. Nevertheless, I thought she was way out of my league and not interested on me so I stopeed seeing her in that way. 

Now, I would say that the feelings I had hadn't disappeared entirely but I find her friend (the girl I've been dating) more attractive and filling than her, she just eases my tough days, and while thinking about this, I realised, I find our common friend less atractive than ever. This thought has made me feel fucking horrible, like a human piece of shit, and I don't know what to do.

My conclusion is: even though I could have dated our common friend some time ago, I think that the girl I've been dating is awesome and I'm really into her. I'm not, physically and personally, interested in our friend and I feel horrible about this.

I have a few individuals to talk too but they don't live near me. I have never jad anything like a group of friends or social circle. This has caused me tons of depression, jealousy, loneliness ect. Having no friends is by far my biggest insecurity and has been forever. My biggest fear is others realizing I have no friends and judging me for it. My life has been a brutal contradiction of not being comfortable and not getting along with people while also desperately wanting companionship. I really would like a girlfriend but as I get older it seems more and more impossible to meet someone who i like and who actually likes me. 

I have tried online dating for years to no avail. I have very few decent pictures of myself and almost no social media presence. I think i look bad in photos although i know I am not ugly, I am very active and quite fit, although thinner than the ""ideal"" male body type.  I have a decent job and income.  Although I am not good at fashion I usually just wear shorts and t shirt. Also I have let my hair grow the past year and wear a beard, which I don't know if most women like or not. I look like a stoner I think lol people always assume I smoke. 

Last night I went for a walk around town and it was a beautiful summer night and i literally started crying at the sight of people walking around, eating dinner and having drinks with a significant other while I go home alone. This is not good. 

I have also spent years doing things like joining clubs, sports teams ect but I never meet anyone. I always feel like every girl who I am interested in is not attracted to me or already has a boyfriend.

I have felt this way for years and its getting worse.

84,o2pu4i,1624025047,How do i ask a co-worker for her number,"Long story short my (m17) co-worker (f18) and I have been talking a good amount lately. We don't work together a ton because we usually work opposite shifts. But I've run in to her a fair amount and we've talked a lot. And I have a few coworkers that have told me she's really into me.

So I don't really see her enough to ask her for her number formally. I have her number thanks to work posting it on a back wall, but I feel like asking her formally would go better than just texting her out of the blue, but idk. Alternatively I was thinking about adding her on Snapchat casually.

If I saw her more often I would just ask her, but lately every time I see her we bump into each other between shifts and there's not really time for me to bring it up. I'm a little torn what to do.

 Preferably I'd keep talking to her in person, but that's not really an option with work right now.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o2pu4i/how_do_i_ask_a_coworker_for_her_number/

But I met a really cool girl last night! She is different than the girls I usually go for (better personality lol) but still my type so I’m physically attracted to her! And she’s made comments about how she likes guys with my style.

87,o2q7nu,1624026065,Totally lost after this breakup wondering if there is any thing I can do or say?," To give a little background to the initial story:

Was on a float trip with my (28 M) SO (31 F) and a couple of friends and she was slamming seltzers and beer approx (10-12 total) for a four hour float. She is a relative light weight and two drinks normally gets her tipsy. She gets flirtatious with other people, and I find her to be quite annoying the more drunk she gets -- there are some positives she is hyper sexual but it comes out in an unclassy way, e.g. flashing me while other people are around (they are not necessarily looking but she flashed me on the river for instance) etc. I have had more than one experience where she has gotten totally obliterated and been a royal pain in my ass. She managed to flip her kayak on this trip because she had her kayak turned around and was next to a groups raft trying to take a shot of Jim Beam with them. Me and the friends were a little ahead, and the other group had three guys jump out to help her out (I am sure they thought they were gonna score brownie points or something).

On more than one occasion I told her to slow down and so did her friends but she just wouldn't listen and kept on drinking. She continued drinking even after flipping the kayak and getting pestered by the friends husband that the only reason it happened was because she was drunk and was not paying attention.

She is not the most reasonable in general but as she drinks more and more it lessens and frankly I just didn't want to talk to her. I was annoyed and nothing I was going to say was going to lead to a productive conversation so I just would have choose to keep my mouth shut if she would have let me.

The thing that really set her off is she was acting like she had no clue I was miffed even though she had announced to multiple people I was mad and was trying to give me a blowjob as we drove back and I did not want her to. It infuriates her when she cant get what she wants through sex. This culminated with as we were nearing the town we were driving back to, she jumped out of the car (we were only going like 15-20 mph at the time topless. She claims she did nothing wrong and I am a complete asshole for not supporting her getting drunk, and I am sitting here like this is the behavior that makes me think you have no freaking business drinking.... After we got to the friends house, the friend tried to talk her down but she wasnt having it (she told me to take her car and leave and she would find her way back). She walked over to her father's house (right down the street) I stayed and talked with the friend for 20 minutes or so. Some of my stuff was there so I went over and she was in the front yard with it asleep. We spent the night at the friends cause I did not want her doing any stupid shit while we were driving on the highway and she was drunk. The friend helped keep her relatively calm and got her to eat some food.

A perfect example of the boundaries issues, she was bugging me from 10:30 pm -12 pm that night about why I was upset and I initially said ""I am upset because you are 31 going out with the sole intention of getting plastered and you have a history with alcohol issues"". After that I just would say it is late I do not want to talk about this now, she would poke me again to get me to talk with her.

There is the background story to the situation, I took a couple of days to take some time to think about what I wanted, and I decided I would give a last go to see if we could come to some sort of agreement to not get into this situation again (against a lot of peoples advice but I still care about her). I sent her two different texts asking if she wanted to talk and both times she said no.

I asked her if things were completely done or if she was just taking a some time and then wanted to talk. She said completely done and we exchanged some texts where she tried to say that ""I had no empathy and her best friend who went floating with us told her that I did not care about her and she should leave me and that the hate and disgust I had for her was so apparent"". I responded with something to the effect of ""that is interesting because the conversation me and your friend had was totally different, she was in agreement with me that you were being unreasonable and the situation was ridiculous and that it was not hate and disgust from me but rather anger, annoyance, and stressed, because my girlfriend who had self professed alcohol problems was binge drinking which I do not think was or is good for her.

Honestly I am at such a loss for what to do here, I know I should just move on but a part of me just wants to ask her if she got what she wanted in terms of ending the relationship. She has vocalized feelings for awhile that I thought she was not good enough or that I did not care about her, and really that was never the case. I just did not want the bs to happen that caused everything. She caused a scene during a family vacation this past Christmas involving alcohol and I was forgiving of that under the condition she went to therapy which she did. Obviously me staying was indicative that I did care and I did want things to work out and yes I was very angry about the situation this past weekend that led to everything, but her coldness to the situation and trying to blame it on me is like common.

I am sure the advice is going to be just move on but is there anything I can say here to get through to her?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o2q7nu/totally_lost_after_this_breakup_wondering_if/

89,o2r3rv,1624028515,"I’m (29F) done dating, but not in bitter way, just dedication to being better.","I’ve been doing a lot of self-reflecting lately and I realize I have been in a relationship every single year of my life since the age of 17. I’m now going on 29 and I will be 30 this year. I am definitely a serial monogamist and I am just now becoming self-aware of how harmful and impactful it’s been to be in relationships and not embrace solitude and singleness.

I’ve lived on my own for 6 months now and I’ve changed. Just that little bit of time building a routine, customizing my space how I want…it’s been transformative. I briefly tried a relationship with a childhood friend this year but sharing space, the rapidness of it all was just too much for me. Before I would have tried to make it work and changed myself just for the sake of love and a relationship which is kind of sad.

It made me realize, it’s okay to be single. It’s okay to be lonely and crave companionship but continue to grow individually and untethered to someone else. Living on my own, dancing in the kitchen naked, rearranging furniture how I want, not cleaning up after anybody, doing what you want and when you want, I love it. I keep chasing love and relationships in hopes of marriage and passing down the generational love my parents and grandparents have, but it’s not meant to be pressured or in a way where you pour into others above yourself in order to have.

I feel free. No relationship or dating anxiety. No looking for external validation, rejection or going through the motions or settling. Sometimes it’s okay to just stop, take a break and focus on yourself. It feels good to give up and get off the market.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o2r3rv/im_29f_done_dating_but_not_in_bitter_way_just/
90,o2riew,1624029599,Can someone help me figure out what's going on please?,"I (22f) met this guy (28m) at the gym about a month ago. We started training together and really hit it off. Workouts that would usually take 60-90 minutes turned into 3 hour workouts because we spent so much time talking. We exchanged numbers and IG profiles. One thing I noticed is he's awful at texting. If I was lucky and he was online we could have a decent conversation but if not he'd take hours to text back (8-12 hours). But whenever I saw him at the gym we'd talk and have a good time. Since he's a lawyer I figured he was probably really busy during the day so I didn't really care too much that he took so long to reply.

I really liked this guy so last week I asked him out for dinner. He said yes and that we'd agree on a date that weekend. However, he had to leave the country on a trip but he sent me a voice note explaining that he had to leave and we'd go back to training this Tuesday. I did not hear from him the whole weekend. He did see the IG story I posted tho. And on Tuesday I texted him asking him if he was back in town. He still has not replied. He saw my IG story from yesterday and last night he shared a story in a nightclub. (Covid restrictions are lifted in my country)  
I don't know what happened. I thought everything was going really well. Even in his last text he said something about looking forward to training with me when he came back from his trip. Why is he ghosting me all of a sudden? Am I being crazy? My friend thinks I should text him and ask him if everything's ok. I would rather wait to see him and ask him in person.

92,o2rlap,1624029805,Someone gave me issues for this...,"This happened some time ago but just venting.

I consider myself a fairly normal person. I work hard, I have a good personality, and I have hobbies. I'm in the medical field where our hours are very long. Most days in medical school would consist of going to work, coming home after a crazy long day, kicking back and watching some netflix, maybe talking to friends/family and then studying-medical school is chock full of exams. The weekends would be more when I pursued my hobbies. Hanging out with friends, exploring the area, going to local parks, restaurants, drinks with friends, things like that. Admittedly, I probably don't have as much spare time as some other people-for those not familiar with the medical field the hours as a trainee are long (in medical school worked 60 hrs/week on top of studying) but I still made time for hobbies, interests, etc.

This one guy I was talking to/seeing was an attending physician (done with medical school and residency), and he had a lot more time on his hands. He also insisted that he wanted to date someone else who is or will be a doctor. This guy worked a 9-5 job, and every day after work he would go grab drinks with friends, followed by a walk in various parks, and then explore the city. All things I to enjoyed doing and despite my busy schedule I made time to hang out with him as much as he wanted. But...he gave me a VERY hard time when he found out I don't do these things everyday. When you work from 6 AM to 7 PM and have to study, you simply don't have the time to explore the city every single day. It's not like I didn't make time for it. I did, albeit on the weekends or some evenings but not every evening. He judged me and acted all surprised and upset when he found this out...and yet, he insisted he had to date a woman who was in medicine and younger than him, meaning all of them would be in med school or residency working crazy hours.

Obviously I'm not always the most cheerful person, but in general I'm not feeling sad as often as when I'm dating or in a relationship.

On the other hand, being with someone is an exciting and beautiful feeling from the beginning, but gradually I'm becoming more stressed. I'm not feeling good enough, I start noticing imperfections on my body, my face and slowly I feel ashamed of my past, my hobbies, my goals in life and so on.

The worst part is after the breakup, when you're left with now useless information about the other person, that you can't get out of your head.

97,o2rscm,1624030291,"If someone doesn't text you for 3 weeks after hooking up and then asks to see you 3 months from now, do they sound genuine in their intentions?","I'll try to explain this chaotic situation. I met a guy on a dating app a month ago. We went out for one coffee date and talked for several hours. The next date, I visited his place and we hooked up. I knew it was a casual thing on both ends. I also knew he was leaving for a summer job in 3 weeks so assumed it would be over then. That said, due to our first date and the extent that we talked to each other pretty deeply I thought it would be more of a friends-with-benefits situation where we were actually friends who could talk to each other as well as sleeping together. 

However, after hooking up we did not really talk for 3 weeks. He texted later the same day to say it was good to see me. Then a week later I texted in a panic at night because of a bug situation in my house (we.... had discussed spiders so it made sense at the time). He texted back the next day and we chatted briefly but when he suggested I come over, I didn't answer because I was looking for a FWB and not someone who sleeps with you but doesn't talk to you outside of that. I didn't hear from him for 2 weeks and assumed that was the end of it. We were looking for different things.

Then yesterday, he texts out of the blue to say how are you, I wish I could have seen you again, I was just in a rush the past few weeks with moving and are you going to be around in August. (When he comes back.)

Now I'm confused because I assumed he was just in it to sleep with me and move on. While I wasn't unclear on the casual nature of things, I realized afterwards that I was looking for something more serious (either a genuine friends with benefits where you still communicate and support each other, or actual dating). I assumed I should move on because it was clear he wasn't providing that or seeking that. However, it seems like a lot for a casual fuck buddy to want to see you in 3 months and now I'm wondering if he does actually want to date me and it was just genuinely a hard time with his move.

I realize I could just ask him his intentions, but the fact is I've learned by now that people don't always tell the truth and often lie to themselves too. Based on this interaction, does it sound like he's interested in something more than just very casual sex, or was this text just an attempt to be nice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o2rscm/if_someone_doesnt_text_you_for_3_weeks_after/
