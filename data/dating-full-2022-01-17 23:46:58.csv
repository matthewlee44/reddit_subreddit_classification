We met online about 4 months ago on a dating website. We are from different countries both in Europe. Since then we have been in contact on Whatsapp. We video call weekly but text everyday. We have met physically twice and things seemed to be going well.

Yesterday, we had a serious conversation about where this is going. The plan was for her to move here  in my apartment, in the next coming months as we want to know each other better and see where this leads. She would work and study at the same time. Rent would also be shared 70/30 as her finances are not great. 

However, she said that she will not remove her dating profile online ( I have already taken mine off) stating that she would only do it after we get married! She said that she is committed to me and does not talk to anybody online from that website or other social media platforms but wants to keep her profile there. I have asked her several times about any logical answer to explain this but she could not explain and instead called me a manipulator. 

I am not sure how to take this. The plan was to live together to further our relationship and this is a big setback as this shows a lack of commitment IMO. I am confused about how to take this.

I met this guy on tinder about a week ago. We texted for hours one night and the next night we had a phone call which went even better.

We sat in his car and just talked for hours and he asked me on a second date for the next day. We went on a walk for our second date which then lead to us having sex in his place which I definitely wasn't planning on. It was so nice to be with him. He told me he felt like he's known me for so much longer, kept complimenting me and telling me he really likes me. He even asked me if I was free to spend the next weekend with him. Now the next day our conversation has completely died down. We still message. He still messages me good morning and all that but it's not as good as when we're together in person.

 7 months ago, B and I were drunk and slept together and we have been together since that day. On that night, B told me he was in love with me but I wasn't. I was afraid of losing our friendship so I decided to be with B (I know, stupid thing to do). On the first month, things were great so I didn't think too much about it. But then, I started to get annoyed... B is really different as a boyfriend (compared to what he was as a friend). Here are some things:
-when I used to hang out with B and his friends, B would got mad if I answered to his friend (with whom I had a passion 1 year ago that ended because he didn't pay much attention to me and he lives 2h away by plane) or if sometimes I looked at his friend (just look, as I look at other people!)
- if I went to a party, he wanted to know every people that were there. Once I told my boyfriend that I said 'hi' to a guy I hooked in the past and he got really mad
- B was really jealous. However, once he wanted to have a drink with a girl that he dated for 1 year (he really liked her in the past, I Saw that) and he used to text everyday a girl he had a big big crush on some years ago (I got mad and he Said that it was her that was texting first and that he had to answer, however, they didn't have a friendship since the girl refused to have a relationship with him 4 years ago). I used to talk to that girl 1 year ago and she told me that she regretted not having a relationship with B so... It's normal if I don't want them to talk!! B and I had some arguments about it and he stopped answering her
- 1 month ago, B got really mad because I posted a picture on Instagram (usually I don't post anything). I said that it was an obsessive behaviour from him and he said it wouldn't happen again. However, 1 week ago I posted another picture and he said to one of my friends that now I post pictures and that I want to get boy's attention.
-he lives 2 hours away by plane. When I visit him, he just wants to Stay at home and he says that he just wanted to be at home because he was sad since his grandmother was dying BUT when he came back to my city he was always hanging out with his friends. I think that he was jealous of me and his friend being together.
- when B argues with his mother, he starts to punch things and he said to me 2 times that he would like to hit his mother 

So, after all these things I decided I didn't want to continue to have a relationship with B. Besides, I feel that something is missing, I feel that I don't have that connection with him... I feel that I don't have the passion..

For the last month, I'm trying to get some clarity so I got more distant from B. But, 1 week ago, his grandmother died. I called B on the day she died and on the day after and we talked for hours... However on the next day (the funeral day) I didn't talk because we use to talk at night and he said that he was with his friends and didn't he didn't say much more. HOWEVER, he said to one of my friends that I didn't talk to him when his grandmother died!!! I asked him why he said that and he Said that he didn't explain himself well and that he meant that I didn't talk to him on the funeral day. I Said that he was with his friends and he said that I should have asked what time he was going home.

So... Because of all his jealousy, my lack of connection and these dramas I decided to get more distant and breakup in a few days (I wanted to wait because his grandmother died 1 week ago). However, 2 days ago he asked me what was going on and I couldn't take it anymore and I called him and we broke up. It was sad, he was crying a lot. It was a pacific break up, I said that I wanted to break up because I don't want a relationship, I don't feel the passion and I want to focus on my studies (I didn't want to blame him). BUT he said ""oh you don't want a relationship because you want to fuck around!"". So it means that he continues to be jealous!!

Yesterday he sent me a big message, saying that he is really sorry, he knows he was obsessive but that he is like that because he had a very very codependent 3 year relationship that ended 1 month before he started dating me. He said that he was like that too because his grandmother is dying and know he feels much more free... I don't know if I should accept him back... Even if he changes I feel that I don't have that inexplicable love (that I felt before, including with his friend). He says that I seemed in love at the start of out relationship and that I lost it because of his attitude but now he is changed. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!! I don't want to lose him. Maybe I'm wrong and overreacting.. maybe the love comes back now that he is changed...

Today we talked and he apoligized a lot, he Said that tomorrow he is going to talk to a psychologist and that he is ready to change... We never fought, I would get upset with his attitudes but I didn't talk much about it. It seems that my chip changed 1 month ago and he was he was caught by surprise... I'm afraid that I might overreacted and maybe I'm being unfair because I didn't give him any chance to change...

I have social anxiety but I've had some fair share of guys showing interest in me however those experiences were mostly in middle school and I have just started college about 4 months ago so really, I haven't had anything serious yet.

Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, my first year of college is currently online and I resort to talking to people online when it comes to assignments, tests, etc. But I haven't made actual close friends nor have I met up with the people I'm talking to. I'm scared to use a dating app because I'm too insecure about my looks and I want a serious relationship, not a hookup. My family and friends tell me to focus on my career and love can come after but it's genuinely hard for me to focus on my classes because of the online environment and wanting a boyfriend has been on my mind for months now.

Any advice on how to combat these insecurities and find love and acceptance within myself first will be greatly appreciated.

For context I am F/28 that has never been in a relationship before. The co-worker is M/23, who I see briefly on a daily basis. 
I mention that I am romantically inexperienced because I am terrified that I have misread his polite/friendliness for something more.
I have had low self esteem my whole life due to weight issues and bullying so I’m a not the most confident person. 
A few months ago he walks in the office and greets me by name to ask for a document he needed. I was very shocked since we had never met before and I only knew of  him from process of elimination. These interactions happened a few more times through out the next month. Until a co worker of ours told him he could find the sheets elsewhere and doesn’t have to ask me every time. When we interacted the first time I noticed he was not making eye contact with me, and in my experience attractive guys do not make eye contact with me so I don’t think they like me. Over the last month or so I would get very nervous when he would come into the room so I did not make eye contact with him but there have been many instances where he would enter the room and take a deep sigh. Since it’s only us two in the room, I wasn’t sure what to make of it. There have been other things he’s done that give me “into you “ vibes but my insecurity has made me deeply doubt it. 
To make a long story short I began thinking he might be attracted to me but is shy or something. For the past week I have been making it a point to greet him when he comes in, to show my friendliness but also practice for talking to an attractive guy, which I have no expertise in. 
Today I saw him coming up behind me, in the reflection of my window, and when I turned to say hi he answers with a very curt “hi”, instead of his usual hi [my name] and looks down fidgeting with the cuff of his shirt. He was actually waiting for my office manager to get off the phone to ask her something. I was confused because I saw in the reflection of the window that he was facing me, not her,but when I turn around slightly he is messing with his sleeve and looking down. He is usually nicer than that so now I’m concerned that he has realized I am attracted to him and is turned off by it. I don’t know if it’s that he’s immature and I’m trying not to get my feelings hurt because I knew that it was bound to be just my crazy idea that he would be into me, but I’m not hurting anyone by saying hi.

Finally saw her last night after not seeing her for a while and we had been flirting a lot leading up to it. She spent the night and, around 10am today, sent me an ambiguous text basically saying she felt ""unsettled"" by some things and needed some space for herself. 

I said, totally.. take the space you need, but I asked if she could share what things caused her to feel unsettled. And she.... didnt respond. No idea what happened so it really sucks to be left in the dark. My mind keeps running through possibilities, but without clarity I'm left feeling bad and ruminating on all the things that possibly were not right. 

It's probably unintentional, but I find it rude to demand space and go completely silent after texting /talking daily for 3 months straight without at least saying why.

So I (32m) matched with a women (30f) about 6 months ago and very quickly she told me see wasn't in a good place to date and was looking for nothing serious and mostly wanted a friend. Being that we had just matched and I was new to area I agreed. This kicked off us texting for almost every day for hour ours sometimes. Due to my work we didn't hangout for this whole month. However the chats quickly went deep and deeper she was pushing the conversation. She even wanted to meet my mom as she was due to come vist me soon. This struck me as odd since I hadn't even met this women in person yet. 

Finally I get back from work and we end up hanging out doing a shared hobby and grab dinner afterwards.  At the end of it I can't shake the feeling that it felt like a date. She had asked even more personal and deep questions and asked more details about my family.  I have many close friends and none of them went this fast. 

Life got busy again and we didn't hangout much, we talked and I invited her to some things but she was busy. I also noticed she was never really inviting me to things with her and never initiated conversation. 

A few months later of just some texting her and there we end up meeting and grabbing food together.  I'm having a bad day and she digs into me and I tell her I'm not having a great time dating recently and it's been alot of bad luck. She also confesses that she has been having a hard time dating as well and had no luck. She actually invites me to a few things which surprised me. 

We hangout two weeks later and she excitedly tells me right off the bat she's dating one of her friends and she's so excited that he's ""normal"" I'm trying to be happy for her but I'm a little jealous.  As we talk more my dating problems come into the talk and ask for her reasoning of why she asked me to be a friend so quickly responds with a few wants that I didn't have. Okay I get that fine. However then she starts using things that I told her as a friend against me and that she would never want to date someone these issues. ( things like my parents are divorced, and I'm not 100% happy with my job..) I was pretty taken back by that. 

I definitely felt like i was lied to. I was under the impression we were friends and she was continuing to judge me on whether she wanted to date me. Granted I wouldn't want to hide my problems from someone I'm dating. I just felt she asked to be a friend then dug into my past under the guise of friendship to judge me with no pressure of dating. I feel used and lied to.

- She’s been very forward about finding me attractive and has sent me texts like “I can’t wait to kiss that gorgeous face” or alluded to getting into bed with me. While frankness about sex is to be expected with Feeld, I’ve had some bad experiences with people who lay it on this thick before even meeting IRL. 

- She rescheduled our call and was then 40 minutes late to it. She did let me know she was running behind but when 40 minutes passed, I texted to suggest we reschedule. We did end up doing a shorter call but she said “if this were in-person I wouldn’t have been this late” and I found that kind of odd.

- She didn’t really ask me many questions on the call. I asked several.

- She urged me, several times, to hit her up for a porch drop off if I needed any supplies while self isolating after this possible Covid exposure. I’d like to think she was just being very nice, but, like...I’m not giving out my address before we’ve met.

The most recent one we finally got some physical action in (just making out) and it was great. He’s a pretty shy and nervous guy and I come across more confident. I don’t mind this too much as my last long term relationship was with a guy whose personality was way too big for my lower-energy life.

Anyway, while this new guy is a bit different than anyone I’ve dated before, he’s been really kind and communicative. Something I picked up on around the 3rd date is that I feel like he is idolizing or obsessing over me though. A few reasons why:

1. He has a lot of free time and not many friends in town - so he initiates convos and hangouts almost daily. 

2. He mentioned that his friends and mom know about me. He also has a young son (7) and he said he brought me up to him. This all felt a little too fast for me but, it’s not my family/friends/kid to make that decision.

3. He’s offered to run errands for me or fix things around my house. I love acts of service, but in a longterm relationship - not from someone I just met. 

4. today, I managed to find his instagram account and noticed he has hardly posted any photos (like none in the past year) but he posted one of a scene from our last date. I wasn’t in it or anything but something about seeing that made me feel like uh this guy is REALLY into us. 

I don’t want to be too judgmental. I am very grateful for his kindness. However, my last relationship was very codependent and these actions are starting to turn me off a bit.

These statements aren't helpful at all, they will be disregarded.

I'm a 30 year old male, and I've never been in a relationship. More importantly, I've never had actual sex. Perhaps that sounds backwards to you, but it's quite psychologically damaging to most guys
.
I've attempted sex, I met a stranger online and she literally picked me up at a local park and drove me to her house.
She catfished me, her pics didn't look anything like her...but I was so desperate to have sex I bit the bullet and got naked with her.
She gave me crazy oral, but I couldn't get hard to save my life because she was pretty heavy and not my type at all. In addition to that, her lady parts smelled disgusting. Clearly a lack of hygiene.

So aside from that, I've been alone my whole life because of social anxiety and up until 2.5 years ago I was also pretty ugly. I've changed this by eating incredibly healthy and getting into bodybuilding, it literally changed my face.

So now I'm fairly attractive, women stare at me in public and occasionally flirt with me without being too obvious. They sneak glances, and I catch them staring at me when I'm ""not looking.""

The main problem is....I'm bald. 
A year ago I decided to start shaving my head &amp; wearing a hat everywhere I go.
So now.I have a good face &amp; physique, but I'm balder than Mr. Clean.
I legitimately thought muscles &amp; being attractive would at least get me some dates on dating apps, but boy was I wrong!
There isn't a woman in a 50 mile radius that will agree to go on a date with me. I've tried all of the dating apps. Anytime I match, they end up ghosting me. I'm a fairly good photographer, so my pics are very high quality and get really good ratings on photofeeler (while wearing hats).

Last week I finally got a girl's phone number on Bumble who actually agreed to meet up for coffee. I was stoked. She knew I was bald and told me that bald is beautiful.
After hours of getting ready, she stood me up. Couldn't even meet me for a coffee date. No explanation.

After that I came to the realization.....the last 2.5 years of bodybuilding were pointless. Being bald has completely ruined any chances of me dating/screwing.
I've even had someone tell me recently ""I'm not into bald guys, if you had short hair you'd look really good though.""

I did some research on this, found some guy that did an experiment. He is an attractive man who can grow a full head of thick hair. Has a high paying job as a CEO or something. He made two dating profiles, with &amp; without hair.
He got hundreds of matches with hair, almost zero without hair. Same guy. Same face. Same amazing job. 

So now I live in a severely depressed state. I find no joy in anything anymore. I can't even watch a movie because my depression is so severe that I can't follow the storyline. I hate my life and don't want to do anything.

I can't just go out and hit on women, I don't have the social skills/experience for that. I live in a small town. I'm seeing a psychiatrist, but the medications I'm allowed to take are very limited because I'm bipolar (antidepressants don't work for bipolar people).

I don't know what to do. I will not go to prostitution.

You may want to say ""sex won't fix you,"" but you're wrong. It's literally the only thing I've ever wanted to experience in my life. If I could just sleep with a woman one time, it would change my life.
It would give me hope. It would make me want to peruse other things in my life.
I'd love a relationship too of course.

I'm just done. I give up. I regret my existence every waking moment.

I do know I am being closed minded here, but 

I was seeing this girl in college (We were both 19 when we first met) for quite a while over 4 years ago. We weren't officially dating, like a complicated relationship I gotta say. We were pretty much exclusive and intimate with each other until things started to change without any intimacy for months. 

I was introduced to her friend group because I just didn't have much friends in my current city when we first met (I came to study in my city from a different part of the country) and we had to cut ties with each other because we were struggling being in each other's life. She kept getting triggered at things I do/say whereas none of her friends did get triggered/annoyed by the things that she had issues with. I will refer this girl as my ex-friend. 

We ended on good terms wishing each other all the best and my ex friend and her friend groups did always know I was very caring and loving even though she was being extremely rude against me at times.

However, because her friends know that I was at no fault in the relationship, they still like me and they still want to be in touch with me, but I must say that I am not sure if I am interested in being friends with them. 

Reason 1) I actually don't like some of the things her friends group like to do (smoking weed, drinking, swearing unnecessarily, etc) and when this girl and I were arguing, she told me that she was uncomfortable that I was still seeing her friend group. She probs said that at that time cuz she was mad at me, but after we had cut ties with each other, she apologised to me the other day for everything she did to me. Right now I kind of feel like I shouldn't be making her feel uncomfortable anymore by continuing to see her friends because she admitted all of her wrongdoings to me.

Reason 2) I've been recently matched with this new girl on a dating app, we went our first coffee date recently and I thankfully didn't screw things up on the first date. She's happy to see me next time when she's less busy with school. Having known her for a few weeks now, I think I am very uncomfortable to introduce her to any of the friend groups because I can tell that this new girl and myself are quite different from my ex friend's friend groups in terms of things we like to do, lifestyle, etc. Also I am hoping not to tell her anything related to my ex friend because it was full of very happy but also very sad memories in the end overall. If I keep seeing my ex friend's friend groups, she might eventually know about my ex friend and I just don't want things to get complicated....

I've recently told a boyfriend of my ex friend's friend that I had these personal issues and thoughts, and that I was not willing to see them anymore in order to respect my ex friend's final wishes to cut ties with me, but it seems like all of my ex friend's friend group still like me and want to be friends with me. 

It's quite complicated and rough. 

Sorry I do know I am not giving the full context of what's exactly going on. Please ask for clarifications if anything is unclear.

It went well, we got a late lunch, spent some time just talking, then saw a movie, and we had a good time together. We talked about seeing each other again at the end of the night. She messaged me on the app later on to make sure I got home OK (she lives an hour away, I drove there), then texted me from her actual number a little after that to tell me again that she had a great time and asked about some books I had mentioned during our date, so I replied. And that's the last I've heard from her

If she'd messaged me through the app itself, I'd think she just ghosted me. But she had told me during the week that she doesn't give a guy her number until they meet (I'd given her mine), and I figure that's only if a date went well, because otherwise, why bother? So I saw it as a good thing that she was comfortable enough to give her number after. Plus, it'd be a little strange if she texted me from her number just to ask about the books - she could have just done that through the app

The other thing is that she's been a fairly straightforward person about things, so I'd expect her to tell me if she wasn't interested in meeting again - to tell you the truth, when I got the notification on Saturday night from the app, I was expecting her to tell me she had a nice evening, but didn't want to meet again. So I was pleasantly surprised when it was just her checking in, and then more surprised when she texted me again from her number

One final thing to throw out there: I'm at peace with whatever happens. If I see her again, great, if not, it's fine - sometimes things just don't work out. It was a nice afternoon/evening together regardless

I'm not the type who needs to hear from their partner every five minutes, I just found it strange that I haven't heard from her for two days after a good time together and her deciding to give me her number.

Why? 

My mental health takes a drain when the thought of a serious relationship begins. It makes no sense, I'm excited and happy to be with one person, fine being exclusive, then after things turn to the label/title of bf/gf, my body enters a state of panic, fight of flight. While cuddling today, I started to have an anxiety attack while she held me to the point where i wanted nothing to do with her or anyone romantically.

This isn't the first time this has happened, roughly a year ago similarly i get close and intimate with a girl and as things were going good, the thought of a relationship comes up, my brain hits a state of anxiety, panic, questioning (if i truly love her or not, what if i don't love her, why don't i love her, why don't i feel in love with her). This cause me to have an panic reaction, no appetite, can't focus, excelerated heartbeat ECT. It ruins me.

A year later and it's happening again, I have an opportunity for something real, I've been feeling happy with them, then all of a sudden once the thought of a relationship enters, I start to panic, shutter, anxiety kicks in. 

HISTORY: I began dating my first love at the age of 18 and stayed with her for almost 2 years till i left for college. My first love was healthy, everything i wanted in a person and it was great. It set a very high standard for what a relationship and love it. Dating your best friend and having it as your first love was a double edged sword, as it helped me so much understand love and what it was to be loved, but losing a friend post relationship has always effected me.

This first time i felt this type of anxiety was during that break up. Falling out of love with someone you thought you were going to spend the rest of your life with, and trying to force yourself to love them to drag it on, took a toll on me. 3 weeks of not eating, sleeping properly, constant anxiety not knowing what to do, thinking there was something wrong with me. 

But the inevitable happened, breaking up. Although we tried to remain contact as friends on and off (and temporarily getting back together for a summer) we continued to damage each other by just remaining friends, so we went our Separate ways.

Ofc breaking up and having just moved to college gave alit of opportunities, the occasional hook up, ECT. But all those empty casual encounters never made anxious or panicked, just fulfilling temporary needs mutually.

Fast forward, life continued, but i continuously blamed myself for letting the relationship end after years, if only i tried harder to love i would think to myself. Eventually therapy would helped me overcome it, but only recently.

Friends of mine say i never truly got over her, or maybe not over the stress the break up caused me, idk.

I through i was ready for something, but as soon as it got to being official, memories and comparisons hop in my mind, if she's not perfect and i don't feel in love i immediately start to panick, even though I know love isn't perfect.

About me: 24, male, hetero, 5'11"", 150lbs, I'd rate myself as maybe 5/10 face, body of a runner so lean but what I do have is fairly muscular, had one relationship that lasted a couple of months, never had sex, and live in a metro area of several million in midwestern USA. Undiagnosed autistic (what used to be called Asperger's) and ADHD, though I'm usually pretty good at masking when needed.

Some things I have going for me: I'm actually a pretty good model of what you \*should\* do according to a lot of posters on this site. I'm physically active, I'm a pretty talented photographer and musician, I have a number of casual hobbies that I genuinely enjoy, I have good hygiene, and people generally consider me to be pretty funny once they get to know me. My dating profiles have good pictures that show my face and body and I keep my bios/prompts fun but also informative. On Hinge I exclusively send (original and fun, in my opinion) messages instead of just likes.

Some things I don't have going for me: I am pretty shy (but no longer cripplingly so like I was in HS and part of college), I have pretty high sensory sensitivity (making clubs and many bars pretty much out of the question), I'm looking pretty exclusively for a relationship rather than hookups, and I am pretty covid-conscious (asthma) which currently rules out a lot of indoor dating. I am also on the demisexual spectrum, meaning I don't usually develop (strong) sexual attraction to people until I get to know them a bit. As a result most of the people I crush on are friends, though I don't really want to ask my friends out because I have tried it in the past with results ranging from ""sorry I don't feel the same way"" to the end of the friendship. I also prefer not to ask out co-workers for obvious reasons. Hence why I've tried to get into the apps. I've also browsed sites like Meetup, but there doesn't seem to be a lot going on in my area on there. And finally I will only date people with political beliefs similar to my own. It's not too much a problem where I live but also an absolute non-negotiable.

I'm mostly looking for advice from other people who haven't had success covering all the bases of what you're \*supposed\* to do and have had to come up with more creative ways to meet potential partners.

In the past I’ve tried to please my partners but they either make fun of my body (which I leave) or are just not interested in me sexually and say they don’t think of me that way. Like saying they aren’t interested in looking at me topless but that I’m nice, pretty, and smart. I know it’s kind of dumb, but I’d like the man I’m with to find me sexy too.

It feels embarrassing as a girl to have to ask after months for your boyfriend to be interested in taking off your shirt and get a polite no. I feel like an idiot for even having to ask for my boyfriend (at that time) to be interested in taking off my clothes. I feel shallow and dirty.

I feel horrible but I’m so tired of the “but you’re so sweet” moments after being made fun or disinterest in my body. I just want someone to think I’m nice and smart and find the thought of my body appealing too. 

I feel very at ease in my own skin until the man I’m seeing isn’t interested in me, then I feel uncomfortable and just don’t know how to continue dating them. I’m not sure if Im making something out of nothing, none of my friends have experienced this. They want to be loved for who they are inside, I want this too. Everyone I’ve been with says they love me, never felt this way before, want to marry me, etc but Ive never been sexually wanted. I’d just like for it to translate into something physical too.

There was a lot of chemistry and even though we hung out for about an hour, I could tell that we both liked each other a lot. Anyway two days later I decide to text him and invite him out. We both agree on a time. The time to hang out comes around and he calls me and tells me that he’s out doing some errands. He asks me if I’m ready to hang out and I say yes. (This annoyed me because we both agreed on a set time, yet he calls me and asks if I still want to hang out. Even though we had already agreed to).  He tells me that he still needs to go to the store to finish his errands and that he will call me back when he’s done. At this point I am turned off by him still being out doing his errands. An hour passes by and I decide not to wait for him anymore. I send him a text that he could finish whatever he was doing and that I wasn’t willing to hang out anymore, I also wished him a goodnight. The next day he calls me and asks me what was wrong the night before, that he was excited to hang out and that I cancelled on him. I proceed to explain that he didn’t respect the time that we both agreed to hang out. And that it annoys me when people do that. He apologized for the misunderstanding and asked me when we could hang out again. I told him that I would have some free time next week. And my point comes to this, it’s already next week and he has not texted me yet. it’s been a couple of days since we last talked and I am debating whether or not to text him.

I have been consistently seeing one guy for about nine months now and we have never once spoke of what it is we are doing. I have no idea if he’s seeing others, sleeping with others, talking to others, or just being with me. 

In the first 5/6 months I didnt question it, I enjoyed the company and could tell there was common interest and didnt think we really needed to figure it out though I had told him I had a crush on him but that was about it. Around 6/7 I started worrying that he may be seeing others but didnt want to bring it up since I felt it was too late at this point and I had been dabbling in seeing others too. 

Now I’m at this point where everyday I overthink every little thing he says and worry he is in fact with others but I can’t bring myself to talk to him about this. It’s been legit 9 months and I’m still not comfortable talking to him about this. I can’t tell if that is a sign this isn’t supposed to work out or what.

One person hasn’t had a decent meal in three weeks

The other eats fish 3 times a day

The 1st person without food is expected to go out, hunt/fish, clean, cook, prepare the fish perfectly on their own. The few times that the person can eat they must hold back until all the etiquette of eating has been met or else be seen as a degenerate, douchebag, famished hobo with no home training, and therefore punished with more weeks without food 

The 2nd person who gets fish, eats a Shad fish, a very bony but tasty fish, one which at times is terrible to eat. This person must pick through all the bones just to get to the meat. It kinda sucks, and some of the bones are sharp. This person must get good at avoiding the bones, but they still get to eat, regularly

Mind you, the 2nd person did not have to work for or earn their fish. It was simply plopped down on their plate, already cooked for them. However, it was not dissected. That’s their one and only job. They did not have to put forth money to find this fish, or cook it. Someone simply offered to do 95% the work for them. Society does not demand they reciprocate the person who brings the fish unless they “feel” like it

In no way shape or form does the person who gets fish 3 times a day get to compare themselves in the same conversation to the person who hasn’t eaten well in 3 weeks. At the end of the day the person who eats fish 3 times a day can stop accepting the fish when they want. If they decide sturgeon sucks, just throw it in the trash and go on a hiatus. 

The person who does not eat often doesn’t get this option. 

A person who has abundance does not get to complain about the abundance to someone who does not have or compare themselves to the person who is without abundance simply because their abundance naturally gives them a few bad experiences.

It’s like a rich person complaining to a homeless about having to manage their money and keep it away from jealous family members. Yea no, the two comparisons shouldn’t even be in the same convo

We are both 27

We recently connected more than friends 

Please note the fit the past 5 years we have talked almost every single day we live in different places 

We met and went on a vacation
Suddenly everything changed

The guy was nonchalant and got casual

He texted once in two days and had responses which really never lead to anywhere 

I let it go for 3 weeks to a month.  I never even asked for a reason.  

Because he has initiated conversations when I felt not talking to him.  

Then I asked him after that. 

Suddenly the reasons which didn't matter,  became more important  than me. Reading a book was more important  ( I agreed and was okay with it)

I'm not a nagging person but it really hurt because I had told him many times to always be frank and let me know if he didn't want to talk to me anymore.. no reason required. 

Obviously it's not what I want.  I have never shied away from  expressing how much he means to me.  And he also has always been expressive 

I asked him jokingly,  semi-seriously 2-3 times and he always brushed it off and said he had been like that only.  And asked him whether I'll accept him like that. I told him that it's not a question of acceptance,  I just feel somethhas changed Suddenly and it's bothering me.  That he should know that I have always accepted and trusted him.  He is the one who knows about my health issues and treatments 

I know and understand what he is saying but that's not what we do with people at are close to. He hasn't before 

Suddenly he forgets to call. And doesn't even inform me.  He has never done that. He has always asked me what's wrong even when there was nothing.  Asked me for assurance multiple times but only in a funny way and accepted my answers. I always reciprocated and validated. 

This off handed Ness is new. 
Then I got angry and told him that it's unfair that he would act this way when all I requested of him was honesty. 

He insisted nothings wrong and he would tell me if anything is.  And asked me to point out what he has done wrong

I told him that knowing him,  he must know what I'm talking about.  Because he can understand my answers with just my facial expression.  
And he has always been sensitive to my issues. Even the non problem ones.  

So if he hasn't initiated a single proper conversation and rebuffed my attempts with things that don't matter.  It has got to be intentional and he can figure it out himself.  

I told him that next time with anyone,  consider being honest.

He said he didn't like that I was doubting that there was anyone else.  And that he was just talking to his office colleagues on a group casually joking with a newly married guy

He asked to let him call me.  I told him that I'm all for being light and breezy but if I say there's an issue.  I shouldn't have to get angry for him to notice and call or discuss.  

He retorted with a noted and to keep in mind nexttime. 

We haven't spoken since.  I don't plan to unless he does.

In this day and age women make just as much money as men do and maybe even more, especially if you’re an attractive waitress. But the main question is whether women should spend money on dates.
In my personal opinion, I believe who ever asks the other person out on a date should be expected to pay. The way I see it is if a woman asks a guy on a date, and the woman expects the guy to pay, it’s basically like asking for free food. I understand some may disagree with me but that’s just my personal perspective and opinion. If women make just as much as men do, I believe men shouldn’t be expected to pay for dates as much as they were back then.
Now this leads to my second question. I was actually also wondering about this question as I was wondering about the previous question. If men spend most of their money on food for dates and women in general, what do women spend their money on? I would imagine like makeup and stuff like that, but me being a male, I honestly have no idea. 
Now my final question. If guys spend so much money on women, what are the benefits men get from women? I mean women gets benefits from men because of having someone to love and talk to, and have someone to is willing to spend money on you. But what about men? I guess men only really benefit from having someone to love and talk to. I think it’s crazy how men mostly ask women on dates more than women ask men on dates if women benefits more from dating men. I may be the only one with this mindset but I just think that, in this day and age, these expectations and gender roles shouldn’t really exist.

We had our first date 2 weeks ago, which was a cafe and a museum. There was a lot of chemistry and we had fun.

We went out again this past Saturday and she invited me over to her place. We ended up hooking up. This is the first time I’ve hooked up with a girl from dating. The sex was good and she even said “I’m gonna cum”, and her legs were shaking. We hung out for about 1.5 hours after. 

But since then she’s ghosted me all of a sudden. The day after, she only sent me one text, and yesterday, she didn’t respond at all. Prior to this she was texting me all day every day, and even double texting me if I didn’t reply.

I’m kinda sad. I thought she quite liked me. She complimented me a lot, laughed at my jokes, she asked me out on the second date, and her mum even viewed my LinkedIn profile so obviously she’d been telling people about me. 

As I say, it wasn’t a long fling, so I’ll get over it. But how do you guys deal with being ghosted?

Guys, your girl is out there.    
She's alive, living her life, somewhere on this earth, right here, right now.  
  
She's looking for you. Maybe she's not looking for the ""you"" that you are right now. Maybe she wouldn't like the ""you"" that you are right now.  Maybe you've got to get some of your life in order, take care of those things that you know you need to.  
  
You've got to become better than you are this moment. You've got to take those steps to improve yourself to become that guy for her.  
Conversely, she's got to get her life in order, she's got her own problems, and she's working on herself too.  
   
One day your paths will cross. You're both being prepared for it as we speak. And as long as you do the work now, you'll be ready.
