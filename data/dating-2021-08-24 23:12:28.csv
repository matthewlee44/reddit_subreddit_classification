0,pb3sqk,1629865139,How to “ask out” a loose colleague,"I am a college student in a research group of maybe 6-10. We usually don’t work together, and just have a group meeting at the end of each week, with sometimes smaller meetings throughout the week. Anyway, I kind of like one of the girls in the group. I never talked to her before really aside from professional emails and teams messages. But I get the vibe that she is into me, instantly replying to my messages and liking them.  But of course that could be just her personality, I’m not sure. I don’t think she is that bubbly of a person. Anyway, how do I move forward with this?

I got over it but I recently saw him a few times and my feelings have been resurfacing because it was a first crush and we had a lot in common and shared experiences. I dated a few guys but honestly I like that one the most. I’m in my 20s and this is a crush from my early teens and I’ve known the guy since middle school, so it’s been a while. We don’t keep in touch now due to a drift which is why I was kinda surprised to see his social media being on my recommended list. 




He’s popping up everywhere like getting recommended as someone to follow on social media after I saw him when I was out.
But I can’t keep living in the what if’s even if I thought we were good together. Whenever I see him he always stares and it makes me even more upset.

4,pb4c0t,1629867382,Am I doing myself a disservice by not even *trying* to date?,"I know the title is a bit weird/offputting, but just bear with me:

So for context, I met up with my uncle and his new girlfriend recently at a restaurant. He is recently divorced and I haven't seen him much lately because COVID. I've only met his new girlfriend a few times but she's very nice and friendly and the whole family likes her. When I got there they were already a few drinks in, so they both were a little loose-lipped and more open than usual. Somehow she steers the conversation towards my dating life and asked if I was currently dating, and when I said no, she asked why not, but I couldn't answer because we got interrupted by something, either the waitress or my uncle saying something. Later on she says she was going to be my matchmaker and find me somebody, which she has previously joked about in a past quip while I was on the phone with my uncle. 

This got me thinking, am I more ""dateable"" than I previously thought? The reason I haven't even been trying is because I feel like it's kinda useless/hopeless for me to do so at this point in my life. 

I'm 24M, and live in a somewhat rural area with my parents in a smaller house while I save up some money so I can have a strong start in life. I have a car and a decent job permanently working from home right now, I'm in a very good field and have a degree from a well-known university, but I've got a shit ton of student debt and I'm trying to build some experience so I can get a kick-ass job that will ensure I can live comfortably once I move out. So I'm planning on staying here for a couple more years. I have pretty much zero dating experience, not a virgin but I'm still way less ""experienced"" compared to everyone else my age. I don't have much of a social life either, if I go out to do something, it's with family, but I still have a friend who lives in the area who I'm trying to stay in contact with, but I'm pretty bad at that kind of thing so I'm not sure how long that will last. 

I'm really not building a good case for myself, am I? I guess that's the point of this post really, these are things I know I need to fix, but at this point in my life they really can't be fixed without a mountain of effort and a lot of time. I know nobody's perfect and there are probably tons of people who don't have their shit together as well as I do that go on dates all the time, but for the longest time I've felt like I just have too many dealbreakers for girls my age and I'm better off saving myself the wasted energy/constant rejection of trying to date and instead filling my time with work and solo hobbies. Yeah, honestly I'm pretty lonely and depressed, but what else can I really do for the time being?

I don't think my uncle's girlfriend knows any of this about me except for the career stuff and living situation, but still, her broaching the subject just messes with my head and makes me wonder whether I'm needlessly self-sacrificing, and that I'm more ""dateable"" than I realize? Then again, she's a lot older than me and she probably doesn't understand the current landscape for people my age, so maybe her optimism is misplaced? Can anybody else here weigh in on this? Feel free to ask questions to gain more context, I have a tendency to make lengthy posts and I'm trying to cut down and be brief.


TL;DR Uncle's girlfriend trying to be matchmaker, I don't know whether my self-esteem is shit and I have a chance of being successful in dating or if I'm being wise and saving energy/preserving mental health by waiting to move out of parent's house/gaining dating experience",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pb4c0t/am_i_doing_myself_a_disservice_by_not_even_trying/

8,pb4is5,1629868164,I’m afraid of getting back on dating apps again because of fear of failure. How do I get over this and try to go in without expectations?,"I did dating apps for a few months and I didn’t have much success. Sometimes I would have conversations with people but matches were far from plentiful. I tried to force a relationship with someone that I met on a dating app but was unsure about because I was getting nowhere with the other apps, and I felt embarrassed about the fact that I had never had a girlfriend at my age and I was almost done with college. I was also losing a lot of money using them and I don’t want to lose more money because of the dating app addiction. It felt like I was buying a girlfriend and I didn’t get the product I paid for.

I’ve also been trying to move on from someone who emotionally manipulated me (most likely out of immaturity), but I was also coming up with stupid reasons as to why I don’t deserve love. For example, a married man who is around my age (he is married to a girl I went to high school with but never had feelings for, and she is a day younger than me) has an assault rifle on one of his profile pictures and I have never shot a gun in real life which makes me feel inferior to him and makes me feel like I’m not good enough.

10,pb54bk,1629870829,Emotionally Available,"I (32F) recently met a sweetheart (35M) on OLD. This guy is totally different from the guys I've dated in the past. I've had a handful of relationships over my 20s with various dudes but something was always missing. I always felt anxious in those relationships, like I had to guess what the guy was thinking, and it took SO LONG to get to know each other. I never felt like I could get close enough. Even after 2-3 years together, my past relationships still wouldn't feel right.

With this guy, it feels like there's a deeper, easier sort of connection. He shares his feelings openly and he's always available. He's very easy to connect to. He includes me in his hobbies and plans. We share a ton of similar interests. He really impressed me the other day when I failed an interview, he called me to listen to my pity party and cheer me up. Then we just ended up laughing about random stuff. I honestly feel like if we weren't dating, we would be best friends. It's just so easy.

And don't get me wrong, there's a lot about his current situation that I think would deter someone else. But we click so naturally, I find it easy to look past. He's such a kindhearted and nurturing sort of guy. I think his gentle personality is rare to find. Not saying this is the ideal match for everyone, but I finally found what works for me.

I started to develop feelings for her pretty soon, just how I am. She, on the other hand, didn't. She told me she's questioning her sexuality, thinks that she's late at developing feelings unlike I am and she's not sure if she will at all. She has never dated or been in love, just had crushes on people (guys and gals).

Together we enjoy our time, we share similar interests and hobbies, we have similar views on certain things, we are open to each other, share things we usually don't, tell compliments to each other, flirt, flatter each other. She said that she finds me attractive too. During the talk about the sexuality and uncertain feelings I asked her a few things and in general I think she really feels some things for me, cares and stresses about this whole thing a lot. It just feels like we could easily be a couple at this point from my POV, yet something's missing on her end and she doesn't know what.

So I wanna hear some opinions from strangers on the internet, did someone face something similar? How did that turned out?

We’ve been on 3 dates and the 4th is programmed for next week. 

On the first date we’ve talked about wanting something serious. She told me she needed to take things really slow if it was something serious. We haven’t been intimate (not even kissing) yet, I don’t really mind it. We don’t really text (once every three days), but when we see each other it’s always really nice.

I’m fine with taking things slow, but I want to make sure I’m not being « played ». I trust her, but we’re not in a relationship per say, so she doesn’t really owe me anything. I want to talk to her about it, it would put my mind at ease if we could put « rules ». I don’t want her to feel imprisoned, but without any other signs of progression in the relationship, it’s hard for me to figure out where we’re at. 

I don’t want her to misinterpret my intentions, and it’s quite hard to explain (even here I’m struggling), do you think next week would be a reasonable time to talk about all this ? You know, after a glass of wine or two, talking about holidays &amp; all

For the past couple of months, I've had an interest in a girl (18F) who is in my scholarship group at my university, and finally built up the courage to introduce myself during our college's freshman camp.

Once the camp ended, I decided to text her, saying that it was nice to meet her and asking her if she'd like to hang out once we moved onto campus. I'd had her number ever since all of the scholars made a Google sheets with our contact into, but I didn't want to just randomly text her because that'd be weird.

She replied that she was glad to meet me too and that she'd ""love to hang out on campus :)""

We texted pretty constantly ever since, exchanging emojis, gifs, and various applicable pictures to what we were discussing. Lots of compliments back and forth, like ""they don't give this scholarship to just anyone"" for example and joking about things like how pale she is and how easily she gets sunburned and when I crashed my bike before I even moved in.

Anyways, both of us moved in to our respective dorms last Saturday (me engineering honors housing, her university honors housing), and pretty much as soon as she knew I'd moved in she asked if I wanted to hang out that evening, so of course I said yes!

At our university, there's a whole rivalry between these two chicken restaurants, so after some mild banter we decided on the more local one. It was only awkward for like a minute or so, and we just sat down and started talking and talking and talking, for about an hour and a half, with her laughing at all of my jokes, even the crappy ones, and smiling a lot, and barely even eating half of our food, we realized that basically everyone had left and we should get going (side note, I love the spirit of that restaurant).

We walked back to campus and looked at the moon and we parted paths about halfway between our two dorms and she told me to let her know if I wanted to hang out again.

We've kept texting, though limitedly, because we've been so so busy during this week, though I did see her today during an escape room (more like escape building) and she looked really happy to see me and waved enthusiastically.

She's also invited me to some parties by her dorm, and we're planning on hanging out again the two of us (like that song lol) this Friday (she wanted to do Wednesday, but I was busy like a bongo).

I'm planning on asking her out on a true date in a few weeks, but I thought I'd get y'all's thoughts on: a) if you think she likes me romantically or like at all b) if so, how should I proceed.

Honestly - thank you for the time we shared together. I had an absolute blast with you. I think the friendship we shared is the only thing I miss now. You’re one of the smartest people I’ve I had the pleasure of meeting and I enjoyed that about you. I know you were in a broken place (emotionally) when we met…so….in a very weird way…thank you for sharing that time with me. I hope I was uplifting, to some degree, during our time together. 

We are polar opposite human beings in almost every way…and that still puts a huge smile on my face lol. I now know that I loved the idea of being with you; not actually being with you. I don’t hate you nor will I ever hate you but I understand that neither of us can give the other what we want out of life. 

While we did not work out, you deserve nothing but love, happiness, and respect from whomever you are dating/will date in the future. I hope you find the happiness and fulfillment you’ve been looking so hard for.

34,pb6tka,1629878962,Tinder really played cupid on this one,"I know that Tinder gets a bad rep when it comes to finding a long-term relationship (and for good reasons too). But I wanted to share my story that sometimes it just might work.  


I had my fair share of men ghosting me, acting weird, and being overall kinda terrible (oh, so many entertaining stories to tell!) so I decided to give up on the relationship. I started browsing just to find a hookup, no strings attached. I found a guy on my Tinder Gold (yep, I paid for one month, what to do) that looked fun. Nice tattoos, piercings, had a dog in the picture. On his profile, he mentioned that he's looking for FWB or Netflix and chill type ""thing"" so I knew what I was going into.  
We had a thrilling conversation, like really connected on multiple subjects, made jokes, and overall the vibes were impeccable. He is 3 years younger than me (24) but I couldn't really feel any age difference and then again, it was supposed to be sex right?

Well, two days into talking I decided that it's time. I drank some liquid courage, invited him to my place and it kinda went off the rails. As it turns out I got a bit drunk and I don't remember exactly what I said. He filled me in recently that I assured him a couple of times that we are not gonna sleep together this night, and when he said it's cool and we don't have to, I said ""ah, who am I kidding, of course, we're gonna sleep together"". And we did.

I was ready to let him go when he invited me for a walk with his dog and that's where I lost. I completely crushed on him the whole time. Turns out we couldn't stay away from each other. He was a perfect gentleman, we laughed, spent a lot of time together, and went back to his place. 

Even though I was ready to jump ship to avoid potential heartbreak, he did not give up. We talked every day, met every other day, spend weekends at each other houses. I got invited to all the parties and hangouts with his friends, within a week and a half we said ""I love you's"". We met each other families, recently went on vacation together (just the two of us), and are going away for a weekend again. We discussed moving in, children, marriage, all this stuff. Never would've expected a random Tinder match that was sitting in my ""waiting likes"" for a week to be my soulmate.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a couple of long-term relationships before and was never treated with such respect, never felt so wanted and appreciated. This dude makes me laugh every day and the communication is perfect. I've never been happier in my life.

Some weeks ago, I began chatting with another student after we finished our projects. She's been in the same group during the semester, plus we share some common interests, so it did not come out of nowhere. Despite that, the texting felt quite weird: Sometimes, she took up to two or three days to answer - Her replies were not short at all, but still it gave me mixed feelings. Since I really appreciate her joyfulness, I decided to ask her out for a date, expecting a no. Surprisingly, she agreed to it, and we went out of a coffee. The date went well, the conversations were interesting and she also stated that she liked it.

Of course, I asked her out for a second date. Since we both had to study for the exams in August, she replied that she prefers to focus on studying and to see how well it goes, before agreeing to go out again. I did not want to stress her further, since I had to focus on that too. I asked her how the studying went, but no answer.

I did see her before an exam, and we chatted just a bit (more smalltalk). It was not awkward, or she did not seem to feel like that. Additionally, she waved at me when she drove away in the bus and saw me.

I (M23) soon to be 24 have never had a proper relationship. I've been on loads of dates off apps but never got anywhere. 

Hookups have never interested me, I've always desired a deep connection with someone. But to no avail. In recent months I spent too much time feeling sorry for myself. 

My most recent saga ended a few months ago after seven dates with a woman I met off Hinge. I didn't shed a single tear over it but it still got to me. I'm actually proud I didn't cry over it, considering I'm a very sensitive man. 

But most recently, I had a revelation: I can't continue using dating apps. Getting numbers and then instantly getting ghosted will never do your confidence any good. 

I have officially deleted all apps and will work on myself to gain confidence, to be able to approach women irl. It's something I've not done much, but I know if I don't try then I won't ever get anywhere. 

It's okay to long for affection, I have for a very long time now. But it's important you remember to enjoy life when you're single. Think of all the things you can do without worrying about anyone else! 

For all the wonderful, lovely single people on this sub, please remember: you're so awesome you don't even know it!

46,pb7or7,1629883473,Dating as a teetotal male is rough...,"Wondering if any other non-drinkers/smokers here have an absolutely miserable time on dating apps when the alternatives are few and far between. Most people who don't use OLD can rely on going to pubs and clubs and then meeting people organically through friends etc, but that almost always has to involve alcohol, and where I'm from in the UK, 99% of people make drinking or what their favorite drink is a central part of their personality. Going to those places and not drinking has people assuming you're weird or trying to force you into drinking with them.

Swiping through dating apps is mind-numbing, it's almost like seeing the same profile over and over. Wine glass in hand, LED angel wings, birthday balloons and a dress. I don't want to judge that lifestyle because each to their own, but it's like finding a person who actually has hobbies and interests beyond clubbing is nearly impossible these days, even for people in their late 20s who you'd think would have grown beyond it a little bit.

I know I'm in the extreme minority here, and most people's idea of having fun is a good night out, but I've always been more of an introvert and drawn to focusing on my hobbies, working out, and living a clean lifestyle.

The fact that she led me on has just made me think more of her now that I've cut her off for my own mental well being. The last thing she said about it was ""don't do that, or nothing might happen"". That's an example of the mind games she played. 

Anyway, I'm heartbroken and constantly fall into the trap of thinking ""I'm genuinely never going to meet anyone again who makes me feel that way"". And ""I'm going to be alone forever"". It's self pity but hope is just absolutely impossible for me.

Mind you, this woman has had past relationships, is beautiful, successful, sociable etc. Also, I told her I'd stop trying to date her if she told me she's not interested and she said she was not saying that to me because she didn't want to lie to take the easy way out.

So after a really good talk we decided on seeing each other this week and see where it takes us, but tongue in cheek made the deal to stop after a certain number of dates, because that's the mark where guys pull out with her apparently.

I met her through work in february through work and what started off as just a bit of fun with talking on the phone slowly evolved into a really strong connection, we meet for the first time 30 march and after the second date we spoke out to eachother that we like eachother. I always have a hard time opening up but she did not mind and was willing to wait, two weeks later i slept at her place and we slept together. Until that point everything was great between us until a week later she said she does not know if it just friendly between us or romantic. I told her it would be hard for me as i do have those romantic feelings, She just had some doubts about it, some moments she did had attraction towards me and sometimes she did not.

As time progressed we remained friends, still talking on the phone everyday, telling eachother everything going on in our lives and she frequently said things like she is really happy that she has me in her life and that she needs me. But as time progressed it also was harder for me at times. Especially if she was hanging out alone with her guy "" friends"".

I was feeling jealous and really questioning my own self worth/ respect at times. I know i just should have go NC the moment she friendzoned me, but yeah stupid me.

But i was becoming more distant from her to just protect myself and 3 weeks ago she send me a messages that she really misses me and did not thought our bond would ""break"" this quickly. I told her i miss her aswell but from the moment she told me she just wants to be friends a lot had changed because i really thought we were building something more then just friends. she did not respons on my reaction.

For the last 3 weeks our conversations are really dry and it feels forced. I got a snapchat from her last week from her that she was taking a drive with her ex, which she always complained about to me and talked alot about when we were ""dating"" in hindsight it maybe meant she was not over him still.

62,pb9sva,1629892925,Am I [23M] dating too few people?,"I worry that I'm not dating enough people. Everyone always talks on these subs about just how many people you have to filter through before you find the right person. I live an incredibly busy work life, and my social life with friends is massively, massively important to me. So I only tend to date someone when I meet them and feel a really strong connection. 

I've tried to push the boat out a little by going on a few very random dates where I didn't necessarily feel a very strong connection in the past couple of years (maybe one every few months). But honestly, it's quite hard for me to get a date on apps and I only really go for it in real life if I meet someone with whom I really, honestly feel a strong connection to (which maybe happens once a year). So, really, I'm dating maybe 3 or 4 people a year, if that.

I guess the reason I'm concerned about this is that a relationship is something I would really, really like if it was with the right person. I've never really been in a 'proper' one before, and I'm still a virgin - I have a history of sexual abuse that I am getting over, but I think for now I would only feel comfortable having sex if it was with someone I truly cared very deeply about and had built up a very strong trust with. So that's something I really want, and I'm worried that I'm not going through enough people in order to find the person with whom I build that connection.

Btw, it's not a case of me not meeting enough people - I live a very active social life and meet loads of new people every week.

At this point, I would say we are decent friends because we enjoy the same activities together. When we hang out, we have great conversation (one time over a couple hours), but I have no idea whether she has a potential interesting in me beyond a friend. She responds quickly over text. I have not initiated any physical touch, and neither has she when we hang out.

My worry is that if I ask her out, she will get weirded out and not talk to me anymore. But where I am now (college senior) I almost say to myself that I have nothing to lose, and rejection happens all the time. That I can just move on. I am almost 22 and I have never asked a girl out, except for HS prom.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pba09g/should_i_ask_this_girl_on_a_date/
65,pba5av,1629894245,Wildfire evacuation and a girlfriend that won't house me.,"I (30m) live in an area that is evacuated for some terrible wildfires right now, it's a stressful and straining time for everyone. My girlfriend (31) lives 10 minutes from me and is not in a mandatory evacuation zone. We were in a serious relationship for 2 years, had a falling out and started dating again two months ago. We had both talked about how we want to take things slower. I have stayed at her house that she owns and lives in by herself often for the time that we were offical. In the last few months I've stayed over numerous times and things are going well. We exchange 'I love yous' and all the mushy stuff. I'm heading back from an out of state job for four days this weekend, then leaving again. But I can't go home. So I hinted at the idea that maybe I could stay with her, just for two nights without completely asking. She shot it down and has been cold and non supportive. So, instead I paid a ridiculous amount of money for a hotel room (20,000 people are evacuated) in a decent area that'll take my dog too. I'm upset but I feel like I sound entitled. I feel like I'm good enough to stay when she wants me there but not when I NEED it. Am I overreacting? Should I call it quits over this?

67,pbabow,1629894916,Mixed signals; Hot words and cold actions have me completely lost,"So this girl (20’s) I’ve (M/ 20’s) known for a year and asked out for a date was supposed to let me know after she moved, but didn’t. I did not hear from her for 2 weeks and reached back out to find she had already moved. 

I think maybe she was busy or whatever and forgot to remind let me know so I propose a coffee date for the past Sunday (she suggested coffee). She tells me she has a crazy schedule but will let me know. 

So Saturday I didn’t hear from her. Didn’t her from her Sunday morning so I figured it was off. Sunday afternoon she texts me that something came up and she was out of the area... whatever

I tell her to just let me know when she’s free and reply to some small talk she made. I send this Sunday and she leaves me on read. 

Yesterday I run into her on a little campus tour (were both grad students). We are introducing ourselves and are on opposite sides of the circle. I hear her name first and then I’m waiting. It comes to me, I say my name, and she pops out from behind a person gives an awkward wave, and looks like she saw a ghost. She gives me a little hug but makes no effort to talk to me 1-on-1...

She pulls away from the tour to take a phone call for 5 min... comes back and still won’t talk to me 1 on 1 even though I make a point to walk away from the group a bit so it’s private and to give her a chance. Instead she walks behind me talking to some other girl, then tries to introduce me to her and gets her name wrong lol

Then she tells me and the girl she just met she has to meet a friend and leaves mid tour. Gives the other random girl a hug but not me..... and runs off

Afterwards I text her and say it was great to see her but I wish we could talk more trying to be cordial. She tries to justify running off but doesn’t respond to the great to meet you part

I tell her to get in contact with me when she’s free as a act of good-will to keep things cordial since we are in the same-ish circle so we will 100% run into eachother again not expecting her to do it

And then she text’s me back saying, “yeah I think I may be on campus again tomorrow. What about you?”.

Mind you we’ve known each other for a year, she has said she wanted to go out for a year (according to her) she said she wanted to spend her birthday with me in 2 months, and she was “super excited” to go out. I even asked 2 weeks directly if she wanted to go out and she said yes. That’s when she suggested coffee. 

If your not interested that’s cool, she’s had multiple opportunities to cut and run or end it. But she keeps doubling down

So I have realised this. I go out on dates with guys and one of three cases happen:
1. I am not into them
2. I am not crazy about them, I see some red flags but they check other boxes in my checklist (great job, often same as me. Tall. Works out. One/more of these.)
3. I'm crazy about them!

Now I'm talking about when case 2 happens because for case 1, I don't care for a second date and honestly 3 almost never happens, not through OLD atleast.

So I'm not necessarily into these guys, but I try to give it a chance. I feel like I'm fun on dates and we are having fun, there is chemistry and everything. BUT a few dates later they decide somehow to move on and even though that works perfectly for me I am devastated!!

Now that they're not into me anymore, they become these amazing men I can't have.

I met someone who I developed strong feelings for already after 4 dates. During the 4th date, I came on pretty strong admittedly so. I didn't pronounce my love or ask to be exclusive but I did mention that I have strong feelings/butterflies, and how I haven't felt something like this in awhile. I'm not even sure why it was worth mentioning in retrospect but I believe I was coming from a place where I wanted to show how I feel and be the person who gives a lot of love early on rather than play it cool and possibly miss out on an opportunity. We've held hands and kissed many times.

We went on date number 5 recently and I was told that I was liked but the feelings are not mutual. She proceeded to state that she had times in her past where feelings developed over time but she doesn't know if that will be the case here which is something that absolutely makes sense. I get the vibe those feelings won't come but who am I to say that exactly...

Is this one of those time where I'm being let down easy? (which I appreciate how this was handled) or is this something where we should continue to hang out to see what comes of it?

98,pbe1rg,1629906732,General list of red flags in women.,"
As requested by u/throoowwitalllawaaay

I made a general list of red flags in women. Every situation is different.  Not every red flag necessarily means the relationship is doomed, sometimes you need to just work around it. This isn't an all inclusive list, and can usually work for both genders, but I was requested to make one specifically for women. 

**If she isn't responding/engaging in conversation** - She's most likely not interested, and if she is, is it really *worth* it? If a girl wants to talk to you, she WILL. Nobody waits days to answer someone they're genuinely interested in. 
**If she's obsessed with you** - This might seem great at first, but can turn south quick. Codependency is not healthy, and can create a foundation for control, manipulation, and abuse later on.  It's better to have a life outside of your relationship, rather than let your life revolve around it. 
**Always expects you to pay/bad with money** - This might not be an issue right away, but can come back to bite you in the ass in the long run. How can you build a future if your partner can't stop spending? How do you feel about being the breadwinner? Why should it be *your* responsibility to pay for everything? 
**My exes are psycho** - This one take with a grain of salt, because sometimes people legitimately just have bad luck dating and reading people. But in a lot of situations there's one common denominator and a reason their relationships ended badly. So stay on your toes. 
**She slaps/hits you if she's upset** - Physical violence is NEVER okay in a relationship, man or woman. If your date/SO hurts you in some way, run. If they do it once, it's likely it will happen again, and could be *much* worse. 
**She makes her mental health your problem** - A lot of people legitimately have mental health issues, but it is not okay to make them someone else's responsibility. You shouldn't have to tiptoe around them all of the time. If they can't handle their emotions on a day to day basis, they have no business being in a relationship. If they ever ever ever say ""if you leave me, I'll kill myself"", run like the wind. Contact police, family, whoever you need to, to get them the help they need. But that's the end of your responsibility. That is nothing but an abuse/control tactic and is never okay. 
**Showers you with gifts and affection, but uses it against you** - This one is tricky. Have you ever heard of ""love-bombing""? Basically, someone will shower you with affection, but use it against you later. ""I did XYZ for you, and you can't appreciate it?"" You didn't ask for it, you don't owe them anything. It's manipulation. 
**Makes fun of you for humor** - She'll joke about your flaws or make rude comments, but say ""babe it was just a joke"". There's always some truth behind every one, and a lot of people will use humor as an excuse to make fun of you/complain about you. If it hurts your feelings, it was probably meant to even though she said it wasn't. Don't encourage those mind games. If it's a one off situation it might be an honest mistake, but if it's reoccurring, run. 
**She's always picking a fight** - As much as people like to say ""relationships are work"", they shouldn't be like this. Relationships really should be a source of stress relief. If everything you do is a problem to her, you need to find someone where it isn't. You shouldn't have to fight for a relationship, it should come naturally. 
**She doesn't say what she means** - This is a big issue I hear talked about a lot. ""Women never say what they mean"". That just means she has poor communication skills and expects you to just read her mind. Nobody is a mind reader, and relationships don't work without communication. I *promise* you that the women out there who are worth it, *will* tell you exactly what they want. How are you supposed to know unless she tells you? That's not fair to you.
**She plays the poor me act** - Some people are truly down on their luck. But for some they use it as a tool to manipulate you. They just need some help back on their feet, but never seem to actually get back on their feet. They're usually just using you as a meal ticket. 
**She only talks about her ex** - Sometimes this is unavoidable if they've spent years of their life with an ex. However, this is often a sign they are not over them or might be comparing you to them. You shouldn't have to compete for your partner. 
**She isn't consistent** - If some days she's super interested, and other days she's not. She might be working, might have other commitments, but watch for patterns. If she's hot and cold all of the time, you might not be the only one on her radar. If she does have other commitments, are you okay with working around those?

You might be thinking, well how do I find a woman that doesn't have any of these red flags? If it were easy, everyone would be in great relationships. But it's not.  Sometimes you need to sift through *hundreds* of women before you find her. It is not worth dating someone who doesn't give you the love and affection you deserve. Again, this list does not include *all* red flags, but just some major ones I see come up a lot. 

I can't link anything here, but look of different types of emotional abuse tactics. 
Read them, get familiar with them, and save yourself some hurt in the future. 

Remember, you never are obligated to stay in a relationship. Their life is NOT your responsibility. Take care of yourself first. And communicate, communicate, communicate.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pbe1rg/general_list_of_red_flags_in_women/
