I eventually found out I'm into guys as well and decided to lean towards that direction due to my anxieties of talking to women again (I literally have had no female friends after that incident lol). Recently my friend introduced me to one of his friends friend that was also looking for a relationship. I really want to give it a shot because I'm attracted to women too, but it's just like unfamiliar territory in my mind now and I'd really like to get out of my anxious mindset of getting hurt again and try to start talking to women again.

7,phf599,1630707465,Am I expecting too much from him too soon?,"Dating is hard. I recently became better acquainted with someone I know in real life (we are in the same friend group) and it is such a refreshing break from online dating. This guy and I have been in the same friend group for years, but we never really hung out or talked too deeply. We were at a party and I accidentally spilled red wine all over is white shirt. I felt real bad and offered him money, but he refused to take it.

I always thought he was cute, so I used this as an opportunity to ask him out. I offered to take him out for lunch as a token of my apology, and he accepted. The party was on a Friday, and we agreed to grab lunch on Sunday. Saturday comes and he asks me what my plans are. I tell him I'm going to an open mic night with my friend. He says it sounds cool, and he lets me know he doesn't have any plans, so I invite him to come along. He ends up bringing his friend, and the 4 of us have a great time.

Sunday comes along, and he and I have a great time at lunch. I pay, as it was my treat. Since the lunch date, he calls me every day to talk to me. We weren't able to see each other during the week, but the following Sunday, we chilled by the pool together. This past week, I ended up getting sick and missing work, and he is out of town for the labor day holiday, so I won't be able to see him.

Our next planned hangout will be next Saturday. We have planned to go hiking. I guess I am freaking out because I was telling my friend about this, and she said it's a red flag that I took him out on a date and payed, and he hasn't reciprocated yet by taking me out on a date where he has paid. Now, it's making me question things.

He and I have only started really talking for 2 weeks. And the hiking trip was his idea. That counts as a date, right? Or should I be worried? We are both 27.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/phf599/am_i_expecting_too_much_from_him_too_soon/
8,phf7ds,1630707669,My ideal dating app/service,"A bit of context, I have a fat/weight gain fetish and am male but I'm questioning my gender identity. I'm super lonely and would love to try dating but these things make that extremely difficult. I don't want everyone to know about my fetish and gender identity issues but those things are obviously very important to be transparent about when dating. 

I think it'd be great if there was a dating app/service that allowed its users to input their kinks and info on their sexuality as well as their disposition or openness towards specific kinks. The app could then pair people based on this info without having to disclose said info right off the bat. So, as an example, I would only be paired or recommended to women who are okay or open to dating someone with a mild fat/weight gain fetish and are interested in dating men and trans-women.

I have to study and home, he has to work in his country, 2,5h flight away from me. I know that we can’t have a future for the next few years and I don’t want to plan my life around a guy I dated for three months obviously. 

I’m just sad about it honestly. It keeps stinging in my heart seeing couples, seeing people who found their person and I can’t be with mine, because dating him and only seeing him once in a while hurts more than being over with him. I just wish I could forget the pain.

12,phffqi,1630708502,"I set boundaries for the first time, and it feels bad","I got very close to this guy a year ago, I liked him but I thought that for him we were just getting close as friends. He used to come to my place the evenings and we would sit on my bed and play guitar or video games (even though he's not into video games at all). 
There were moments where I thought something might be going on due to how we were around each other and the closeness we had.


I was, and still am insanely attracted to him.


After few months he got a girlfriend. He announced it to me one night in a party while we were in bed together and getting physically very close. He held me in his arms the entire night, told me how attracted he is to me, but nothing happened between us.
When I brought it up, he denied everything and acted like he never made a move on me.
I had a hard time processing this. And before I knew it, our relationship completely changed.
He stopped coming to my place, we stopped talking, we stopped seeing each other ... And that hurt me. I missed him, and I knew I shouldn't initiate anything because he had a girlfriend.
We saw each other 5 times at most during 7 months, when we were with other friends.


About 2,5 months ago, they broke up. No one told me, but I could sense it by the way he was acting (flirting?) with me. I was acting cold, and started feeling like I was being rude. So I decided to just give it a try and hang out with him again.


He came to my place one night, we had fun. Then when he said ""we should do this again"" and started planning, I just couldn't.... And I started telling him that what he did before hurt me. I explained how it bothered me.
We had a long talk, we talked for 3 hours. He realized what he did and explained to me. And I do believe and forgive him. He was sincerely sorry.


He told me that there was something between us, that he couldn't define. But those evening were definitely not just as friends. And that he couldn't keep seeing me while he was in a relationship. But he did admit that he should have told me straight up instead of denying it.


I told him that I don't want us to get close again, and then have the same thing happen when he gets another girlfriend. He agreed, because he knows that things might go out of hand if we keep hanging out.
We decided we wouldn't see each other just the two of us anymore.


It made us sad, we hugged for a really long time, and things got heated up again. We are definitely not just friends, we are both attracted to each other. But he said he's afraid to get into a relationship with me, because he doesn't know how long it's gonna last, that he likes me a lot as a friend and doesn't want me to get hurt.


He ended up leaving my place at 3 am. That was the last time we do something together just the two of us. It was heartbreaking seeing that the feelings were mutual but that we couldn't be together.


I still feel sad about it. I want to call him, talk to him, hang out with him. But I don't want to suffer again. This is for the best. I will not allow myself to go into another messed up blurry situationship without being in an actual relationship.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/phffqi/i_set_boundaries_for_the_first_time_and_it_feels/

Which leads me to believe that most men are fronting when they say that they have options. Is this true?

Furthermore, as I have gotten older, it's really dawned on me that dating is both expensive and emotionally draining for all parties involved. At this point I can't even imagine dating more than 3 people (beyond a 1st date) at one time. So I don't believe that most men are actively dating 5+ women at one time. And when I say ""dating"", I don't mean hanging out or Netflix n' Chill... I'm referring to  taking a woman out to engage in a well-planned, elaborate activity that took a fair amount of planning and also includes dinner and drinks.

And in the case that men have a rotation going, I'm almost certain that there are only 1 or 2 girls they are truly putting effort into courting and everyone else is gleefully settling for scraps.

16,phfw8j,1630710090,My dating experience as a overweight dude,"Hello, i would like to share my experience as a 24 yo guy, I'm pansexual. 

So sometimes, like once a couple of months, I happen to meet people that interest me thought friends or event. I'm only physically interested, I rarely meet people that share my interests.

I use dating app and my experience is different depending on the app. But I started using okcupid 1 year ago and it's the only app where I can have match with girls and meet people that share my interests. I use pictures where I have really nice postures (that doesnt make my belly too big), with nice clothes and taken by someone else.
Although I have only meet 3 peoples. So like once every month I matched with someone where there was reciprocal interests. 

I also use social media mainly twitter to slide in some DMs but it never worked(except to make friends)

Usually when i match with someone I try to know them, talk about myself, talk about stuffs in commons. Usually if the other person doesn't invest themselves in the discussion or that we share nothing in common I let the conversation die.

Usually date go well but I always wonder if weight will be a problem cause sometimes I met girl online, they seems interested in me until they see how I look like. 

Now I date a lot less cause I have a FWB with whom I spent a lot of time, we have lot in common and they doesnt care about how I look like .... I guess I was lucky to meet someone that give little importance to physical appearance. I still met people that interest me (but rarely)

The other people I met or chatted just needed sex or where not interested in me(including people bigger than me)

Usually I just attract old gay persons or horny dude that want sex.

This summer I have met a lot of new people and spend significant amount of time in bars (with friend).
Usually in bar and party i don't go toward stranger I find attractive cause I dont know what to say. I already fought my lack of confidence a long time ago... now I don't know what to do or say when I have nothing in common with the other person in those situations 


So I'm overweight I started working out again since june, I try to eat healthy as much as possible, my social skills are good only when I have stuffs in common with the persons in front of me. I have like 2 outfits that make me more attractive, but I'm still searching for a way to make me more attractive with clothes 


So I have said everything I guess, if you have advice I'll be glad to hear them !!!!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/phfw8j/my_dating_experience_as_a_overweight_dude/

I feel sick to my stomach.,"I understand people move on differently and at different times. It’s been about 4 months since our break up - we dated for a bit over a year. She’s already slept with other people and now is seeing someone, meanwhile I haven’t been able to get a date. It’s hard to believe I’ve been “replaced” in a sense. She’s doing everything she did with me with someone new. All the little intimate experiences we shared, the late nights, the dances, the short kisses, the “I love you’s”. Everything we had… now with someone else.

And I get that’s the nature of things. She has to move on. I have to move on. I suppose it’s been easier for her though. I wish I could find someone so I could feel that way about someone again and to share a life with her. But I don’t want to just move on for the sake of it, or find a rebound of some sort. I don’t want to put this on someone else before I handle it.

Until then though it’s going to hurt. I wish it didn’t. I don’t know. I’m in my feelings a lot today and the news of her being with someone really stings. I hope she’s happy at least and cared for. I wish it was me or I had someone at least but that’s not the case. Just wanted to vent I suppose or get some advice for moving on.

25,phg8xl,1630711371,Relationship Advice!,"It’s a long read! Just warning you. But if you think you’re up for the challenge, read away and give me some advice! Thanks ❤️

I am in one of the most healthy relationships I have ever been in, but I can’t shake these thoughts and feelings. 

Let’s start from the beginning. I spent most of my teenage years and some of my young adult like in a three year relationship. Him and I had so much chemistry, and we have so much in common. We broke up August of 2020 after some cheating on his end, and some emotional/manipulation problems on mine. We had been together for so long and it really started to get unhealthy towards the end and I can now see that. We have two dogs together, who I have 100% of the time. He didn’t like to work or do anything other than play video games and sleep. I had spent a lot of my time “mothering” him. I would pay his rent, teach him how to do taxes and basically do everything a mother would. My love language really is caring for people and doing acts of service but I started to get burnout with every task I felt like I needed to do. 

I started this new relationship I am in now in January of 2021, after hanging out for a few months. I would also like to add that he is a friend of me ex’s. It wasn’t done intentionally to upset anyone, but it did cause some hard feelings. At this time in my life, I was drinking very heavily and not in a good mental place. I stopped drinking a few months ago, and I feel so much better mentally. In the beginning of this relationship he was gone very often for work trips, usually lasting between 2-5 weeks long. We moved in together really quickly since he wasn’t really living at his apartment since he’d only get to be back for a week or two. I think it was a month or two in. Just in the past couple months he’s started working at a construction job where we live and is home 100% of the time now. He’s an adult! He pays his own bills and saves his money (with a little guidance from me). But I don’t have to mother him. He’s motivated, loves working and doing tasks even on his days off. He does do acts of service for me too and he knows I love when he does those sort of things for me. 

Now here’s the thing. It’s been slowly chipping away at me. We are polar opposites. We have nothing in common. We often time get in really heated arguments about politics and he ends up really upset. We’re both stubborn as hell and that doesn’t help either. I do love and care about him but I can’t see myself in a relationship with someone who doesn’t share the same morals and ethics with me. I couldn’t imagine raising my children or staring a home with the views he wants to instill in his children. And the WORST of all, he doesn’t like my dogs. I have two dogs, and they’re not perfect but they’re good and they listen to me. They act weird around him, and he has stated many times that he just doesn’t like them. Specifically because he “doesn’t like little dogs”, they’re medium sized dogs. I told him if he ever laid a hand on my dog, I would lose my shit and become unglued. 

I also had a run in with my ex at a music festival and we hung out. Nothing inappropriate or crossing boundaries (I actually told my current boyfriend all about it) but it just made me realize how emotionally unhappy I am in the relationship I am in now. I don’t think I’d ever go back to my ex, but it just showed me how much I don’t have in common with my current boyfriend. 

It’s really hard to think about right now and my mind is trying to convince me one way or another everyday. It could just be relationship anxiety (which I do get) but this feels different. I really do love and care about him, but I’m just future tripping. My family and friends like him! 

If you have any advice I’d love to hear it! Or if you have any questions on the situation to give better advice, I can definitely answer anything!

However, I feel like casual sex is so normalized and common anymore that I feel so out of place being a 21 year old female in college who needs a little more time to feel comfortable enough to have sex with someone (trauma, past experiences, and overall mental well being have led me to this). I feel like literally any man i have ever talked to or dated expects me to put out practically ASAP. Whenever I tell friends that I’m talking to a guy or if I’m out at night with a guy, even my friends ask if we are going to hook up. Basically, I often times feel so uncomfortable in a sex charged society because I feel like I am the outlier. I especially worry that people may see me differently or as the girl who “doesn’t put out.” I know everyone says that people like that shouldn’t be worth my time, but I feel like it is so ever-present. It honestly feels like I’m so alone in all of this, and I don’t even know how to go about explaining it to others, especially guys that I’m interested in. It’s not like talking about my trauma is a great conversation topic as to why I need more time — so I wonder, what should I do? How can I navigate this?

36,phh5a4,1630714754,"I told my friend I had feelings for him, and he just sees me as a friend. Was it really all in my head??. (Long post)","I (F22) told my friend (M24) that over the summer when we got closer that I started catching feelings for him. I wasn’t planning on telling him because sometimes it definitely felt like the feelings were reciprocated, and other times I’ll think not because he’s so private with his emotions. He’s a very flirty person and being friends with him I do notice that a lot of girls around him think he’s into them more than he really is. So basically a bit of a player whether he means to be or not. He’s dated a few times before, and at the start of our friendship had an LDR, I’ve never had a bf. 

(I’ve also NEVER caught feelings for a guy friend and I have a predominately guy friend group. It’s him, my guy best friend that has only ever been platonic, and my brother, with an extended group of a few more girls and guys.) I do feel that my feelings for him were real because I haven’t gone that place with a friend.

In July, long after he and his LDR broke up from the winter, we were skirting on a situation-ship, our hangouts are always like 5 hours minimum, we’re so comfortable around each other and make each other laugh. It just made sense. I went on my first hangout with him 1-1 where we had a dinner and a movie, and I at first thought “oh I don’t have butterflies, maybe I don’t like him as much as I thought!” but then I thought that was a good thing because I wasn’t nervous around him. We would hang out three more times, we went to a museum and our friends kept leaving us alone because it looked like we had a moment. At the bat with some friends we were snuggling under my sweater, he danced with me on the dance floor after taking a shot and loosening up and HE reached out to hold my hands and twirled me around etc. I usually always hug him but he started to initiate goodbye hugs and hold me tight and the hugs will linger. 

My other girl friends that know I like him kept encouraging me and saying “he totally likes you it’s so OBVIOUS” and basically pushing me to say something all summer. My platonic bff (M22) didn’t know anything about his feelings but said that relationships that start off as friends tend to be more successful. 

So over the weekend my friend (M22) told me he (M24) was going on a date and thought I should know. It was just some classmate that we talk to sometimes, and he wasn’t really interested but said yes because he admired her confidence in asking him out. Naturally this made me upset because it felt like everything that was building up just got knocked down in minutes. I visit them on campus the next day, not realizing his date was THAT day in one of the cafes on campus. It was so heartbreaking seeing him on a date right in front of my eyes. 

He said it was just fine, nothing crazy. I hang out with him separately for an hour before his next class and this is where I tell him I started catching feelings for him. He seemed pleasantly surprised by this news, and was smiling but then he cuts me off and says “I’m sorry I just see you as a friend”. He said it so casually and I was taken aback, so I played it off like no big deal, but I was crushed and confused and EMBARRASSED. 

He said it won’t be awkward for him that I just have “a little crush” and when I drove him back he hugged me and waved before leaving. The second I got on the highway I broke down. Told my other friend what went down etc. The next day I sent him a text saying I thought he felt the same way and didn’t want to hold it in anymore. Then I said I would need some space from him before I can be comfortable around him again. He was nice about it and said take all the time I need and that he'll always be around. and since then I haven't spoken to him all week and he keeps watching every IG story I post.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/phh5a4/i_told_my_friend_i_had_feelings_for_him_and_he/

Back like way in the past..like a couple years ago..I know this is super super lame and cringe but I used to like..post nudes on Reddit..just to see what strangers had to say about my body..it was weird but I did it and then I weirdly liked the anonymous attention. I posted when I got drunk and lonely and I sexted with strange men on the internet..yes I know it’s pathetic. Anyway. Moving on. 

August this year, I was in Chicago and really missed my boyfriend (started dating in June, hadn’t seen him since July). I got super drunk and horny so I posted again..like I was horny for my boyfriend but he wasn’t there physically so the only thing I could do to stop myself from cheating on him was to post a nude on Reddit again..and then flirt with a bunch of strangers. 

I don’t know why but this is all coming back to me..do I tell him??

It was a one time thing I did in the first week of August…but I guess it kind of still counts as cheating. I know a lot of people say porn doesn’t count as cheating…so I guess I wonder what category this falls into. I don’t know what to do.

Then we kept meeting at some mutual friend's place on weekends, then we started meeting alone (not dating) just hanging out in a park or at her or my backyard and talk about some general stuff.   


Then she started taking my opinion about some personal stuff and open up about her family and her friends, what she likes, her future plans, ... etc. And we went for lunch twice, she invited me for a dinner and watch movie at her place once and sometimes we flirt and compliment each other.  


BUT, Some night she invited me to a gathering of her friends and we had a good night out, and on the way back she told me she has a FWB relationship and the reason is she is in her mid/early 20s and don't want anything serious now and she also told me she has never been in a serious relationship before, only this FWB and a previous FWB relationship.  


Right now I am pretty confused, she told more than one time she really likes hanging out with me and she shows interest in my personal life and also I like hanging out with her and she literally told me very personal stuff.  


Am I a good friend to her, if so, What's the flirting is all about? , or Is she interested in me (relationship wise)?

42,phhxgc,1630717767,Initiating all physical contact,"Hey all, my boyfriend (17m) and I (17f) have been dating for a little less than a month now. It’s both of our first relationship and we’re new to everything that goes with relationships too. I asked him out like 2.5 months ago and we became official a few weeks ago. However, we have known each other for like 3 years from being on the same sports team and school.

About two weeks ago I hugged him before I left his house which was a big step for him (he is quite shy and inexperienced). Then about week ago, we were sitting together on my couch and I put my head on his shoulder. He put his arm around me and we stayed like that for a while. Then when hanging out yesterday, we cuddled a few times and rested our heads on each other and hugged. I also held his hand on a walk. 

I feel such a genuine connection with him and he is literally the sweetest thing ever. I admire that he is respectful of my space and isn’t forcing himself on me, but I wish that he would initiate physical contact more. I have anxiety and I overthink and that maybe he doesn’t like me. I really want to kiss him but I want to give him the opportunity to show me affection so he feels good about himself. I’m just worried that he’s too shy to initiate contact or that maybe he doesn’t want to.

44,phi26l,1630718287,Online dating is hell,"So I'm attractive, not model attractive but like girl next door attractive. I've been called pretty and cute. I'm bubbly and friendly but can be a bit quirky sometimes. But online dating has been hell for me. Nothing seems to really pan out. Seems like most of the guys there just want something casual even if they're 30. All the convos are superficial or have no substance. 

I definitely do not put out the vibe I want something casual. I'm using hinge right now. 

It makes me disheartened because my last relationship was toxic but I always think how at least my ex would have deep discussions with me, at least when we first started dating, then I learned he was a narcissistic asshole. That's despite the point. I miss that connection I had with my ex in the beginning. He didn't pressure me to have sex with him and we went slow. Just feels like all the men of these dating apps just want to have sex right away or they get bored. 

Based on past experiences I need to be comfortable enough with someone to have sex with them, but seems most people aren't that patient. And since coming out from an abusive relationship, I really need that security in a way that I can trust the person. It's so hard dating, especially when you have just come out of an abusive relationship. No one feels safe. It's like they just see me as a pretty object but not as a person, or a human being.

My friend wasnt abusive or anything like that, but he was holding back emotions, still talking to his ex(which he got back together with even before the breakup). Basically used her. And now I’ve come to find that he is not the guy I know anymore. 

The last week or two has been the best in a long time. Spoken with her on ft almost twice a day. Sometimes she actually falls asleep on some. And I’ve gotta admit I have caught feelings for her. And she’s shown me by multiple signs and hints that she likes me back. 

But a couple of days ago I asked her what we were. And we both said we didnt know, but wanted to find out. She also said that right now she needs to rebuild before she can get into a relationship. Very understandable, considering I weng through the same breakup a year ago.

54,phj5y8,1630722760,Unsure of how I handled this situation,"Here’s how the story goes.

I met a girl on Tinder. We sarcastically went back and forth with one another over text. Eventually got her number.

Then BAM. I got FaceTimed. I wasn’t expecting it. So I kinda flustered my way thru it and said I wasn’t really available right then so then I FT’d her back later on.

We had a good 2 hour conversation or so, but it was getting really late and it was a weekday so I was making it pretty clear that I had to get off but she kinda kept not respecting that. Then, I finally was just like “listen I’m going to bed” and I turned off the lights and she hung up. She then texted that she understood that I had to go but that she was “upset by how I said it”. Honestly, this was red flag #1.

So the next day she kinda just texts me outta the blue talking about something that happened in her class. So we banter back and forth and then BAM…I get another FT call but I was literally in the middle of working out so I said that and quickly hopped off. She was upset. It seemed kinda clear at this point that she didn’t respect I had other things going on in my life.

So I call her back again later when I’m free. She doesn’t answer and immediately just texts “🙄” then said I hung up on her earlier. Then she randomly says she’s about to be naked. I kinda just brushed that off cause we didn’t know each other real well and it came outta nowhere.

She wanted me to FT shortly after this so I did…and she was in the shower. Like it seemed that I interrupted her and she didn’t want to speak cause she thought her roommate would think she’s weird. So I just said for her to call me back when she’s done.

She then got upset that I didn’t want to talk to her or see her naked. I basically just pointed out that we barely know each other and it just felt weird to me.

Then she goes on about how I don’t want to talk to her. I basically just pointed out that we had agreed to meet in a couple weeks and that I was busy otherwise and that her calls were just random.

I kinda got fed up with the BS at that point and I blocked her. Idk, just felt that my boundaries didn’t matter.

There had to be a logical explanation, but to add on to the bad news she stopped texting me and just disappeared for 4 years.

59,phjcjs,1630723523,Not happy when single?,"
I’m a 24 year old female and I am always been told that I am the total package. That people don’t know how I’m single. Yet I’ve only been in two serious relationships in my life and have always been broken up with. I can’t find someone who wants to stay in my life. 

The only times I’ve been happy are when I’m in a romantic relationship and usually they end up being toxic and takes away my happiness Bc I have an anxious attachment style while they are avoidant. The last guy I was dating, seemed perfect. We literally had everything in common besides the fact that he didn’t want to be official even though he claimed he liked me so much and treated me like a gf. This was one of the first times I’ve ever set boundaries and have been the one to end the relationship because my needs weren’t being met. Usually the guy always ends things with me. 

I’ve worked on being less anxious, but it seems like I still can’t get out of that cycle. Once I think things have gotten better and I’ve done the work, I get into a relationship, and a similar cycle occurs. 

I’ve went on a couple dates since that guy and I ended things, and I can’t help but compared everyone to him. That guy and I were just so compatible. I’ve never been so similar to someone in my life. 

I honestly just feel super let down with dating. I don’t feel like there is anyone that I like or am interested in on dating apps and it’s so hard to find people in real life when I go to the gym or when I go out. 

I honestly just feel really miserable and I hate how my happiness depends on a guy and whether I am in a relationship or not.

67,phjj23,1630724267,"Who are the men who have dating so easy they are making no effort in conversation, asking random women for sex, and ghosting women constantly?","I keep hearing from women on here about how every guy only wants sex, makes zero effort in conversation, and ignores or ghosts them. I think this is absurd because it certainly doesn't match my behavior on dating apps.

Then I hear from men on here talking about how they get no matches, how if they write custom messages based on a woman's profiles they still get no replies, and how they can't even get a date or second date if they get a first. That matches more what I see in the real world of what men I know go through.

So who are all these guys women are complaining about? Who are the guys who have so many thousands of women trying to date them they just don't even care anymore and behave this way?

Do they even exist? Are they all tall white supermodels? Or is this just a fiction?

It reminds me of how women talk about how ""guys only say hey as an opener,"" but when I see any online dating experiments with a woman's profile (or any female friend/relative's profile) they get loads of well thought out messages.

I feel like there's some disconnect here that's not adding up.

Like there's one thread on here where a woman asked ""Why don't men make any effort in dating?"" and then she goes on to describe how she's chasing a guy who's stuck at home on a DUI and just keeps asking her to come over to his place but she can't find anyone else because ""he's so good looking.""

Is this the sort of thing women mean? Or what exactly?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/phjj23/who_are_the_men_who_have_dating_so_easy_they_are/

I thought I was in love with a man before, otherwise I’d just be a full out lesbian. I think women are overwhelmingly more attractive than men, I see a man I don’t think is ugly maybe once every few years. I see women fall for these guys who seem way less attractive than they are, who aren’t very nice and put them down, who never get them off in the bedroom, and I’m just curious what’s so attractive about them? I found my ex attractive physically (REALLY drawn to him) but didn’t really like who he was as a person. Ok, actually I hated who he was. But I still liked him, I thought about him all the time, even though I would never want to marry him bc he just wasn’t very nice or responsible. So I guess I’m wondering if that’s attraction? Or something else. I’ve dated men since who I feel fondness for but I don’t want to interact with them sexually and it feels like a chore and is often painful. I’ve been SA many times by men I’m dating bc I don’t want to have sex with them and they do. I’ve even thrown up a few times from men touching me when I don’t want them too, it grosses me out. I haven’t been with a man in almost a year and have no plans to. But I really desired my ex. I felt drawn to him, almost magnetically. So I’m wondering what this means?

I’m very focused on my career and work a lot of hours so free time is limited. In fact I’m going to be working through the weekend and that often happens. 
When I do have free time I prefer solitary hobbies: playing guitar, reading, painting, etc.
I hate bars, clubs, and loud crowded environments in general. I’ve always been quiet and reserved. I basically work and if I have free time I only seem to have energy for my solitary hobbies.
I like being alone for the most part and rarely feel the need for friends. But I’m only human and sometimes I do feel lonely and I know I don’t want to be alone forever. I just don’t even know how I’m supposed to change that at this point.

75,phkm81,1630728775,Emotionally exhausted from playing the game,"A little backstory for this - 

I always had Tinder and Bumble downloaded on my phone but never really tried too hard to find dates or a relationship for a couple of years out of college. My father and mother started to really encourage me to find someone in my life so I tried a little harder to seek out a significant other. 

I had relative success with finding dates and etc. I would usually get about 2-3 dates with different girls each month. It was fun but most of those dates never really develop into anything serious.

On the girls that I really felt good connections and feelings about it always end up breaking my heart. Two of those girls have told me that they're talking and seeing other people after like the second date. Whenever they tell me, I am always flabbergasted and unsure where I stand in their eyes after those talks. I always feel like I am playing some sort of games where I need to prove how much I want them. It always feel really fake to me and I don't believe that love should be a competition between men but something organically felt between two people. 

The recent one really broke my heart. I just ended up deleting all my dating apps and getting off of social media. Had to really dig deep inside myself and ask myself what do I want and how do I want to live a life with others or even potential be alone forever. This subreddit helped me a lot that I am not the only one with dating woes.

I am going to step away from this for a bit to recollect and understand some things more clearly. Going to focus on the simpler things in life like studying for my certs and running for new PRs.

He lives 2 hours away from me. With our busy schedule, we only hang out every 2-3 weeks. In the beginning, we talked about how we are both looking for a serious relationship. Around the 3rd date, he told me he is not talking to anyone else. Since the start, he would only text me every 2-3 days, but he would call me at least once a week. When we talk on the phone, we would talk for an hour. I feel like we have a great connection. He invited me to his friend's wedding as his plus one. He told me that I would have fun meeting his friends. I told him that i would go with him. He asked me a month ago. 

Last week, we made plans to hang out. I am going to visit him and see his house for the first time. We planned to watch movies and order takeout. He told me that he was excited to see me. So last week, we texted almost every day and we had two phone calls. This was weird because he would never text me every day. I texted him on Sunday, and he didn't reply until Tuesday. I replied on Wednesday and he didn't reply until Thursday. He apologized to me and said, he had a busy date at work. He told me that if we could plan a phone call this weekend. To talk about our plans. And i told him i was free today, but he told me that he was going to a baseball game. I didn't reply until this morning because i fell asleep. I texted him this morning. And he hasn't replied. The last few days, he has been acting distant, or is he pulling away. The vibe changed. Does he need space? 

I am not sure this is a red flag, but we haven't had any physical touch. He hasn't kissed me yet. If he did initiate any physical touch, he gets awkward. At first, i thought he was a gentleman and he respects me. Or he is not attractive to me. This connection is making me feel anxious and nervous.

1. High quality photos of your great lifestyle. (Photographer)
2. Well fitted clothes.  Buy custom clothing if you want dates.
3. Have goals and a schedule that is more important than dates or dating.
4. Have pre-planned well thought out messages that you will copy and paste.  You are a Company looking to hire someone, not the other way around.  Your way or the highway.
5. Send no more than 5 messages to get a date.  If she wants more info, delete her, move on.
6. Control the date, planning, schedule, time ect from the beginning. If you lose this part and let her start planning you will lose the girl.
7. Actually use the word ""date"" often, all the time.  Not hang out, hook up, go out.  This means gibberish to a girl.  ""Date"" is the socially accepted word to use when meeting someone for romance.
8. Have a plan after the date.  Let her know what's really up. What you really want at the first date.  Don't waste people's time.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/phlv84/guys_who_understand_women_are_cleaning_up/

Finding your right half consumes lots and lots of time and money. Welcome to the world of online dating. You no longer have to search for someone special through your friends circle, just log on to a online dating site and you are ready to go to find your better half. It is reverse kind of phenomenon, in which a person understands one’s aspirations and expectations via internet and finally decides to meet in person.**  

&amp;#x200B;

**There are many benefits that glorify this concept. Anonymity is the first and foremost benefit that online dating provides you. You may hide your vital information including contacts, address, surnames and so on. This provides you a freedom to know the person better without a fear of being revealed. You may choose to be anonymous if you wish to until you trust a particular chap.**  

&amp;#x200B;

**Security, moreover, is other benefit which invites ladies for online dating whole heartedly. No more you need to fear unwanted person to disturb you and interrupt your search for a right match. In case someone gets on you, you may block him and continue with your search. Just logging onto a right dating site can get you access to millions of prospects to go through.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Just a few words regarding your online dating venture:**

&amp;#x200B;

**\* Don’t be half hearted and get ready for risk bearing. Not all ventures go 100% successful, hence, it is important to prepare yourself for some let downs. Be sure what you want and get a through research work done before actual dating.**

**\* Spoil yourself. Treat yourself with good and new clothes and get some shopping stuff that relaxes and you and provide better confidence then ever.**

**\* Decide in advance the reasons you are dating for. Be sure, what you want from your partner and does the search satisfy your dating goal. Be sure if you are seeking for nice companionship or you are seeking for a life partner or so.**

**\* Boost up your confidence before going for any sorts of date. Attending social functions and getting along with your friends would surely enhance a positive aura around you.**

**\* Decide the meeting place in advance. Be sure, the place to be public enough. Although night clubs prove to be a bad idea for meeting for first time. Obviously you would not like to scream into ears to get your views conveyed to your partner. Choose a place like a coffee shop that proves to be ideal to talk to.**
