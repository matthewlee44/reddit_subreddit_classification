3,om16kx,1626514776,"She finally agreed to go on a date with me next week, what to plan ahead?","Long story alert…

I’ve (M) been attracted to this lady since last week, when she helped me and my friends starting on a new mobile career plan, on installment and new phones. The whole thing was pretty messy at the beginning but she handled the whole thing so gracefully I instantly fell for her. 

The whole time she was having small talks with all of us, we exchanged generic informations, but no social media ID or contact. The whole process took around 3hours and when everything was finished, she came along to the exit door and when my friends entered the car, I asked her out, and she said maybe. 

I never knew what to say when you face a maybe, so I blurted, “so what do I do now?”

Luckily enough, she said, “you should wait patiently!”

I took it as a challenge. 

Fortunately, the career shift wasn’t smooth, so I had to go the store a few times around the week, along with some other necessities, which allowed me to talk to her and know more about each other, and finally today, I asked her again, how do I change the Maybe to an Yes. She smiled, and said she doesn’t know, as she’s taking summer classes and has work. 

I said, a 30mins won’t do much harm, and I’m taking the same courses in her department so I know the deal.

She smiled again, and said, okay next week!

I told her, I know which days you work, Tuesday, and Friday, and another day I’m missing, and she corrected, Wednesday.

I said I came here Wednesday, you weren’t there, and then she corrected me again, she works in the morning that day. 

So I said see you next week and left the store. 

I didn’t stop there. I noticed she was having a cold problem, so I went to Starbucks, bought a hot chocolate, and went back to store. That time she was assisting other customer, and when she was done, she came to me, and I handed her the cup. 

She was genuinely happy, I could see that. 

And when I was going back, I turned back, and said, see you next week, and she gracefully said the same too. 

Now that I can say, I am going to have a date NEXT WEEK, what should I plan ahead?

At first, which day should I choose?

As I haven’t taken her number yet, because I feel this is a very personal information, so my only to pick her is to meet her in the store on her work days. 

Plus, what else should I plan ahead? I hear people say do not go on lunch/dinner on the first date. But as I am from a different culture (Indian Subcontinent) I wish to take her to an Indian Restaurant nearby which is pretty good. 

Seeking advice from experts. Thanks. 

TL;DR Cellular store Lady finally agreed to go on a date next week. Only way to pick her up is to meet her in store. She works Tuesday Friday and Wednesday (morning shift). Need advice on which day to choose, and what to plan ahead before the date.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/om16kx/she_finally_agreed_to_go_on_a_date_with_me_next/
4,om16o9,1626514790,*LONG* FWB Debacle (23M),"
I’ve been lurking the past few days because of my own unaddressed trauma so I’ll share.  

Matched with a girl on tinder (18f) who was super cute with great pics. Got off tinder fast to Snapchat, she quickly turned things sexual and we hooked up pretty quick. I’m no ladies man I’m just decently attractive and fit, I also have anxiety problems like the average zoomer. I feel like a mistake I made early on was answering her question of how many partners ive had. I told her the truth which was 2 at the time, she would be the third. She told me I would be her tenth which I genuinely do not and still do not have a problem with. She also told me she didn’t want a relationship, which at first disappointed me but I became okay with it as long as she was actually a friend to me.

We had amazing, mind blowing sex as in my **** was chafed after doing it for an hour or two. Had her orgasm in the double digits from foreplay and the real thing. Genuinely best sex ive had. She told me the same as most of the guys she’d slept with had been one time things that were bad.

Great I’m looking forward to this new hot friend who I can fuck (lol). She told me she had mental health issues and I’m the type of person who cares for people they are intimate with even in this situation, so I would support her when she was sad etc. I can’t express how sincere I was with that, I have mental health problems myself and trauma from my past. 

Fast forward because this is getting rambly, anytime I would bring up my own problems I would get literally zero response. She would actually ignore what I said to snap me some cute photo. She would tell me she didn’t want a relationship when I would bring up that that was unfair to me as if I was asking for a relationship, then use BPD as an excuse for any bad behavior as if she has no responsibility for her actions. 

I would ask her to hang out and she would always insist on letting me know vaguely at some point in the future with no consideration of my time (happened over ten times). I just genuinely wanted to see her as a friend. Obviously I cared much more than she did. But she would always tell me how much she cared about me and my feelings, it’s like she was a different person when we talked on the phone versus Snapchat and text. I called off an overtime shift once to see her after we verbally made plans on FaceTime just for her to cancel last minute so she could hang out with her friends.

She was only 15 minutes away from me and could only make time to see me barely once a month. Continuously claim she doesn’t want a relationship when I would bring up how inconsiderate some of this behavior was, randomly ask me about my exes and if she was hotter than her, grilling me if I fucked any girls when I went on vacation. I cut her off a few times for several weeks because of this behavior but I would always let her back in when she would text me because she was cool in person.

The last straw was her trying to humiliate me when she cancelled on me last minute again. She told me she couldn’t come that day after work because she felt sick. We had made very explicit plans over FaceTime, there was no doubt about these plans I’m just expendable. Okay,we keep chatting and try to make another plan for later in the week. I end up FaceTiming because it would be easier and she is dolled up in her car going to see her friend. Then she said “you’re always disappointed/rude when I don’t end up coming. I never said I would.” Then she tells me she knows I have feelings for her, it all clicked right then. It was humiliating to feel like this whole time she was using me because she knew I cared more than she did. That she probably told her friends that she had this guy falling for her giving her attention while she had no intention of seeing me just leading me on for the umpteenth time. I was actually talking to other girls at this point so I let her know that as well as remind her I told her we would NEVER be in a relationship because of her behavior. She’s tells me to go fuck my h-words then. Huh???? FYI when we didn’t see each other for two months she hooked up with her ex who gave her two stds. I just can’t win. 

So caring about someone’s well being and being considerate of others time is considered a relationship now? This is scarring as it makes me want to never open up and care again Just to have it thrown back in my face as if she has power over me because of my good nature.

6,om18lv,1626515079,Similar pattern with men I meet,"I’ve been going through some pattern here with men I meet online.

They are usually from a country nearby, employed as an army guy.

Anyways we would talk, then they would visit my country, we would meet. We would spend a great time together, we would have sex, they would treat me as a gf. 

They would already tell me when they are coming next, and they would look mad serious about that. They would tell me they had a great time and would like to progress somewhere slowly. We would still be talking after they are back to their country but just a little less. After some days they would ghost me/block me or even delete their IG accounts (I checked with fake acc) 

So I’m guessing they do have women there that they possibly cheat on but they are hiding it. I don’t understand why? They could be fair and told me it’s just one time thing, I wasn’t planning to marry them but giving false hopes is so annoying. Also from perspective of their gf’s, how dare are they?!

11,om21nz,1626519338,Dating in the military. Age gap,"F/27 here. 
I'll try to be short. I've tried something with an older guy (40), but despite our connection, undeniable chemistry, we end up fighting a lot and now we've decided to take a break from each other. 
They we're some things going on, as follows: 
-we're both in the military, officers. Being a female in the military and a lot younger (inferior rank, obviously) seems to be an issue and I partially understand. Regardless of smart or diplomatic I might be, people will still talk shit about female in the military and that bugs him. The age difference says a lot, as back in the days there were a lot fewer females in the system and he gets to hang out with people his age, listening to their sexist, inappropriate comments, also seeing women using their sex appeal as an advantage and I feel like this gets to be projected on me. We met outside work, so he said often that he can't see me as someone in the military, but we both know that's an issue. I don't know if he can get past it;

-the early jealousy tantrum. He acted all jealous over an incident I mentioned happened after first encounter. We didn't kiss or establish that we're dating at that point and the situation went from 1 to 100 really fast and he was constantly bringing that up, although I was telling him constantly that i was owning him anything back then. He just projected on me his plans and dreams and me not going that fast just triggered his insecurities. Took him months to apologize for being out of the line;

-communication styles. We don't communicate in the same way. I try not to take things personally, but I feel like sometimes he's patronizing me and I told him that. I don't have a problem with constructive criticism and arguments, but he called me naive several times, bankrolled eyes at me and there are times when he acts (and verbally mentioned) like he's disappointed. The last fight was on why I dont keep my phone on sight. I told him I get to see him once a week, so i don't need my phone to constantly check, which was entirely true, but he insisted so much on not believing me, on me having something to hide or be ashamed of I started crying in anger and frustration. I think that if that was something bothering him, he should have asked specifically. This is how I do, I point out what bothers me, but he 'wanted to see me act naturally'. This lack of clear communication and acceptance towards natural behavior annoys and frustrates me. 

-I told him once I don't think I can feel loved by someone like him and I know this will stay with him forever. When things are good between us are really good, he treats me nicely, he has manners, he's smart and appealing, but when we disagree on the smallest thing, the power imbalance feels rather obvious. He makes me feel small, naive and patronized, rather than someone with less experience he can tactfully taught, if he wants. And even if there's something I might be be right on, purely theoretical subject, sometimes he takes  my personal opinion like a mind game I'm playing just have a different opinion than his. I just like debates and is not the first time I'm mentioning. 

The question is...why do I keep getting back in this vicious cycle and how do I break it? Does it worth trying again? Is it something that can be fixed using a different approach? 

I do think about him often, but the reasons I mentioned above weight a lot, especially the first one, as is the one completely out of control. He never dated in the system, I can tell he really likes me, not ashamed or scared to go out with me in public, but the system is a trigger for him. He gets annoyed by plenty of aspects work related and being both in it, I can't be avoided permanently. There's a tension between us and sometimes it doesn't feel right. We've been through a lot already and our honeymoon phase was smashed by the early fights on jealosy and system. 

We both struggle with depression, anxiety and various traumas, but we never bonded on those. We expressed our vulnerabilities, but we seem to be unable to treat each other calmly and compassionately. It almost feels like mirroring each other. 

Then how 2 people so similar can't get along and have so much friction between them?

My arrogance has started to be a problem since I've never approached a girl, but all my past relationships I've been approached by the girls. I honestly think that im good looking but my biggest problem is that im really shy (with girls).

I've caught my self thinking that im better than most girls, and only thinking about sex with them. I've even told some that i see them as objects and not wanting anything else than sex. Really cruel I know.
I wasn't like this before, i had female friends and some of them were attracted to me but i acted like i didn't know it and play it off.

Since the pandemic started my exgf broke up with me and that made me really insecure since i always thought she was out of my league but she dumped me anyway (I really cared for her, called her every day, took her out and always payed, told her things I've never told anyone, etc).

(My partner is non-binary so I will refer to them as s/o)

TW: mentions of sh and suicide

Throw away account since they know my main

Me and my s/o have been dating for 2 and a half years and we’re both in our late teens, but due to their strict parents we only se each other about twice a month. We both have our fair share of personal problems, mental illnesses, and other challenges we deal with but they are on a different level.

They have depression, anxiety and an ED, but show signs of BPD, Adhd/Autism, schizophrenia, and a couple other things that I can’t remember.

They come from a family were their father was extremely abusive to them and their mother, both are drunks, smoke a ton, don’t know how to show affection to their kids ,are terrible when it comes to taking their children to hospitals when they need to be at one ,and don’t believe their children have any mental illness even when putting them through multiple traumatic experiences when while we were together. I hear them constantly fighting and have heard the father make fun of my s/o’s cuts and multiple attempts of suicide.

So all around a horrible environment.

Since even before our relationship started I’ve always tried my hardest to be there for them when no one else would, tried my best into talking them out of a lot of things, and as quarantine came around it severely impacted their mental health to where this is the worse I’ve seen them.

Although they have apologized multiple times for the way they are and feel like I would leave them since their “too much baggage” unfortunately I feel like that’s what’s happening.

They now were constantly struggles to get out of bed (often spending full days in bed), never eating, constantly conveying ways that they would want to “go out”, purposely sending me other people with a better physique, or having aggressive mood swings towards me out of no where. I can’t even find time to talk to them about my own issues without them bringing up how they have it worse. 

And when they aren’t doing any of this they’re completely obsessed with me. Talks of marriage, kids, apartment planning ,stealing my clothing, wanting to look like me and does things that make themselves extremely uncomfortable just to “make me happy” when usually I beg them not to do so and other things when Im just about to be a young adult next year

I’ve tried my best to accommodate to the best of my abilities to them constantly even when I’m tired, sick, or emotional/mentally unavailable and after dealing with them so long I feel drained and unhappy with the relationship.

And it doesn’t help when neither of us have friends anymore so I have no one to vent my stress out to so I’ve just been holding it in and try my best to distract myself whenever I get the opportunity to be alone or off the phone with them. 

I’m also trying to go into a career of music, but feel like I have to put away my interests since I either get too passionate about it and become “annoying” or just that I have to put their problems first.

At this current moment I feel as if I don’t care what’s going on with them anymore and would want to stay single for awhile if we end up splitting.

I really don’t know what to do anymore and apologies for how this is worded, I’ve never had to type something like this.

TLDR : S/o is extremely mentally ill and I feel unhappy about our current relationship and where it stands

Last week I finally got the courage to message her on IG and I suggested that she should join me for a run sometime. Surprisingly she said that it would be really nice and we arranged to go for a run last weekend. after the run I asked her to get coffee with me and she immediately agreed. And I have to say I had the best time with her. The conversation was constantly going, there was no awkwardness or silence at all. She was asking me a lot of personal questions as like she was trying to get to know me better and I was doing the same. There’s was some banter and mocking of each other. I walked her to the station and she even gave me a hug. 

Naturally after an hour or so I messaged her to say that I had great time talking to her and that it would be nice if we did this again! I also wished her a nice weekend as she was saying how excited she is for other plans she had made. The reply I got from her was not the best and not the one I expected. She only wished me a nice weekend too and didn’t even acknowledge the previous message…

After a few days and some convincing from my friends that I messaged her again, i message her to ask if she wanted to meet up on the weekend and very quick I got a response saying that she is working on the weekend and can’t make it. Nothing else, didn’t propose alternative time, didn’t try to hold a conversation with me or anything, so I left it there….

This outcome really made no sense to me so since then all I have been trying to figure out is why that happened. Is it possible that I completely miss read the situation and the date was not actually that great or did i pick the wrong energy from here? Is it me or is it her own issues or sth?

30,om4pin,1626530131,Can someone explain to me how is dating even worth it for a man?,"In order to expend effort on something, there must be a benefit to be obtained - but I don't think there really is much benefit in dating a woman.

Let's look at what would a man expect out of a relationship:

- an emotional connection

You can straight up forget about this one. A woman will never feel anything close to a real ""emotional connection"" to a man when she has 10 other options, ready to replace you in a week.

You cannot feel ""emotional connection"" to someone who you cannot relate to - majority of women have robust social lives and dozens of bodies before they hit 20, while male loneliness is at an all times high. A ""good social life"" to a man would be crippling loneliness to a woman, they are used to being wanted by everyone. How can you relate to someone like that?

- for the partner to put in an equal amount of effort

Will never happen. Women are used to men doing everything: the first approach, carrying the convo, chasing after her, making plans, paying for everything...

Only thing women really offer in a relationship is sex, but that feels good for them too, so can we really consider ""a favor""?

If the man stops putting in all the effort needed to maintain the ""relationship"", then the woman will simply find someone else who will.

- be actually wanted and desired

Not gonna happen for men who dont look like male modes


And for a man to even qualify to *attempt* to date, he must first check a number of physical requirements: height, good looking face, be socially well versed, have income and not be considered a loser by society, fit...

Its all just too much work for no return...",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/om4pin/can_someone_explain_to_me_how_is_dating_even/

Any advice?","For the last several months, I’ve been going out with a “girl—friend” we’re both educators and get along really well. Last weekend, her friend went out with us, she was telling my friend how attractive I was and how she wanted to talk to me. 

I found out later, that she had just gotten out of a 2yr relationship so I was cautious of the situation. We exchanged numbers and have been talking the entire week. She’s been really trying to get to know me intimately and I quote “fighting sleep so she could respond to me”

I’m out with my friends last night, and I see her. We hug and talk a little bit. I end up hanging out with her friend group. But there’s this guy there, that looks like they have something going on between them. Every time however that I’d look over, she would stop holding his hand if I looked in her direction or she’d try to get closer to me. 

I don’t compete for anyone, so I go back and hangout with my friends the remainder of the night. I guess I’m just lost, why go out of your way to text me, and want to get to know me, but essentially show up to the bar with a guy it looks like you’re talking to? Like yeah I thought she was pretty, but I was not pressed to get her number or anything.

32,om4sy5,1626530459,Proceeding with caution,"I've (21F) been seeing this guy (25M) for a little over a week now and we've been on three dates in total, one where I spent the night. We discussed early on what we were looking for, I said I wanted a relationship, he said he wasn't necessarily looking for a relationship but was open to one and that he hoped that wasn't a dealbreaker for me (I said no, but I don't have casual sex). We have not had sex though we have a lot of passion between us and spend a lot of time doing other things and he's very attentive to what I like and don't like. We have very interesting, thought-provoking conversations and definitely have plenty to talk about when the conversation is non-sexual and often poke fun at and joke with each other. He told me that he likes me and has told me he's taking a trip in early august so he wanted to communicate that to me because I had expressed earlier how important communication was for me. Whenever we're together he always says ""next time we should XYZ"" and has given me vague invitations to events down the line and he'll stare at me when he thinks I'm not looking and even when I am looking he'll stare right into my eyes and say nothing then smile, and ask me what I'm thinking about.

Anyway, I hope that this is going somewhere but it's sorta hard to believe that it is because 1) I'm not entirely sure that we are on the same page about what we want and 2) I've been disappointed in dating before when things seemed to be going somewhere but ended up not working out. He's shown a lot more initiative in person than over the phone (we exchange a few texts everyday but no phone calls and don't have each others social media) which I don't know is more about how he communicates or shows a lower interest (I'm thinking the first thing). For now I'm going to continue to take things slow, talk to other people and date around, and see where it goes but try not to let my expectations or idea of who I want him to be ruin the course of things.

I asked her how she feels and she said she feels the same way but "" it's hard to tell "" which put doubts in my mind. My problem is that we only meet up like once or twice a week. She's told me that she wants to meet up more, but has been busy recently so she cant. She's been to the doctors and discovered that she's infertile but they don't know why and her stepdads dad has died recently which she was sad about but she wasn't very close to him so she wasn't destroyed by the situation. I'm pretty worried about her and I don't know her situation that well but I want your advice on sending her this:

""Xxxxx, I want you to know that I would appreciate spending more time with you. Sometimes I find it hard to tell whether you're busy so you're unable to hang out when you otherwise would, or you simply don't want to hang out. I want it to be clear that I will not be offended if you tell me you don't want to hang out, I understand and respect that it's your decision whether you meet up with me or not, that your life shouldn't revolve around me and you can have your own interests. It's important for you to know what I want as well as it being important for me to know what you want so that we can figure out a way for us both to be happy. I know you've said you've been busy recently and I hope you're not too stressed but I thought this message was important to send regardless &lt;3""

I want to be as open as possible with her but I'm not sure if that's off putting or not.

But even though we can't date we still wanted to be close friends, I enjoy being friends, she cuddles me for two seconds it feels so nice, sometimes we accidently hold hands and smile at each right after and it feels incredible, I wish we could do it more, I've suggested going to her parents as a friend for them to get to know me first so I can hopefully gain their trust but she doesn't think it will work, I just want to be able to show her how much I love her, I sometimes really want to kiss her but I have to stop myself.

I'm not gonna do it behind her parents back because I love her too much to want to risk her getting in trouble, but I don't know how to stop feeling this way or make sure two can date.

47,om71bg,1626537775,I’m addicted. Dependant. I need the distraction. The attention. But I hate dating.,"I had a bunch of dates this week, and got overwhelmed, and deleted tinder. That was the last dating app I still had, kept it longer than usual. (6 weeks?) 
Last night I had a falling out with a guy I went on five dates with. Basically he’s a player, lied to me about his intentions, I called him on it, and he left in the middle of the night. 
So today I’m feeling used and alone and depressed. Not over that loser. Just over life. 
I’m a 51 yo widow. I’ve always been in relationships. This is my first time living alone since I was 22. I love it! I’ve met a few hobosexuals, and generally avoid them. I’m committed to staying single this summer. Really giving dating a shot. And I thought I had the hang of it. I’m just treating the guys I meet like a friend. Going with the flow. Seeing what happens. I’m mad at myself I let that one guy into my life. But he kinda wore me down. I can’t believe he had me thinking, he was the guy who would make me want to give up dating. Because despite my intentions to stay single. I am tired of dating, and being disappointed. Love bombed then let go. 
I’m trying so hard to not download another app. I feel so weak. I keep telling myself, but maybe he’s out there. I need to keep trying. 
But what if I don’t. Why can’t I just go a day or a week or a month without being on any apps? Without the constant hello, hey, how you doin? 
Why can’t I just embrace my life, and get control of my grief, and not depend on others to distract me from my depression? 
I’m pretty well adjusted. Most of the guys I meet are into me. I get lots of attention. It’s like a high I can’t live without. Till I crash and burn. And it’s so hard constantly having to send that “sorry I’m not interested” text after each date. 
I know I probably need therapy but figured I’d start with Reddit lol. 
So what is it? An unhealthy addiction? Or a needed outlet, a necessary step to finding the one who is truly going to treasure me. 

I met my late husband online over six years ago. He’s been gone for a year and a half. I believe in fate and I know my man is out there looking for me. Don’t I have to make the effort to find him?

Obviously no one forces these men to take these women out on dates  .

53,om78mg,1626538466,2 great dates followed by whiskey dick,"I (37M) went on a second date last night with a woman I met on tinder. I suggested that we go to this pretty swank place that we had talked about on the first date and we had a great time. We really had a great time on both dates, the chemistry was great, lots in common, and the attraction was very mutual. My intention was to pay for the entirety because she did the first time around, as I had told her I would on the first date, but she had told the waiter to bring her the bill while I was in the bathroom. I protested but didn't want to make a deal of it, thanked her, and told her next time is definitely on me please!

So last night we end up at my place around midnight, and we've both had a few but we were far from drunk. So I set the mood and we get down to it, and things are going nicely until I notice that I'm starting to lose my ahem virility and this is when the anxiety starts to set in, making it even worse. So I pause for a bit to just relax and take in the moment to get back into it, meanwhile I'm reassuring her it's really not you it's me let's just take a few etc.

To preface, it's odd 'cause I don't really consider myself to have ED, and my willy would easily spring to life throughout both dates as there was a lot of light touching, but I guess it isn't clutch during the big game. This has happened before as well and not recently, but once I got through the first time with my last partners I would never experience it again and it would only get better, although most of those times there was always alcohol involved.

Anyway, I'm lying down next to her in bed just chilling out for a few, and I'm starting to feel her mood wind down, and about 5 min later she gets up, tells me ""don't worry about it"". That's my queue to worry, so I reluctantly ask her to stick around cause it's gonna come back up any minute now and try to explain I'm just having a little performance anxiety, but I know that with my anxiety of her wanting to leave now coupled with all the booze it's going to be a moonshot. She seemed pissed and shot back with ""you know what? It's not even about the money, but I could've spent those 300 bucks on hanging out with my girlfriends tonight instead"", and she left.

I felt kind of bummed after that. I didn't mean to kill the mood, and I thought that was kind of tough to hear cause sparks were just flying before all this and I thought the rapport we had built could get us through that hiccup, but I digress. oh well, guess I blew it, but now I'm worried this is just going to keep happening.

56,om7aus,1626538663,Is it wrong to not date a transgender?,"Is it wrongful, transphobic or anti-LGBT to not date a trans woman? 2 weeks ago, I introduced my friend to a dating app and within 2 days, he got his first match and first date (yay!). Things were looking very promising for him. They exchanged messages and arranged a date. I was proud of him for accomplishing this so quickly.

And then tragedy struck. During the middle of the date, the woman told him that she was trans. And then my friend said in a polite way that he wouldn't date a trans woman because he's straight but would still be friends with her. Then she stormed out of the restaurant and left him alone. When he went home, he received a lot of abusive text messages from her calling him anti-LGBT, a right-wing supporter, transphobic and to name a few other offensive terms. It got so bad he had to block her.

While some dating sites/apps offer the option for transgender or it would show up in their description, her profile did not contain any of this. She was classified as a regular woman in that profile so he wasn't able to find out until she met. Not to mention the way she dressed and her body appearances looked nothing masculine (although she had a deeper than normal voice). Now would I support him even if he accepted dating her? Yes but he chose not to. We don't hate or anti-support the LGBT community. In fact we went to a pride support parade 2 years ago as straight guys. He even has friends who are MTF trans on his Facebook.

Unfortunately he has avoided dating apps because he's afraid he might end up dating another trans woman. So is it really wrongful to choose not to date a transgender as a non-LGBT person? And if you were to reject a trans woman because they're trans, how would you tell them in a kinder way? Or what would be an easier way to tell if they're trans during a dating profile if there's no mention on this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/om7aus/is_it_wrong_to_not_date_a_transgender/

Here’s the thing, I find most girls to be ugly, there’s a certain type I like, that I get attracted to. They aren’t 10/10 models by any means, in fact some may consider them ugly. It’s more of a personal taste that’s not conventional.

Anyway, the girls that I am attracted to never seem interested, like ever. It’s a very frustrating experience for me. It’s as if I’ve been given a taste that I can’t get, if that makes sense.

My friends sometimes question if I’m straight and claim that I might be gay. This is false I have no attraction for men, I just find most girls to be ugly. It’s like an instinct that kicks in. I don’t mind being friends with some, if they’re cool and all, but never in a romantic way.

95,omar7b,1626549522,Can I salvage this friendship?,"
Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfterbal. 

After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird. 

Tl;dr: met this girl a while ago. Thought she was interested but she wasn’t... now its messing me up in future interactions because now i dont know whats just being friendly and whats interest. I dony want to put anyone in an uncomfterbal spot.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/omar7b/can_i_salvage_this_friendship/

&amp;#x200B;

I\[25M\] met this girl \[25\] 3 weeks ago. We also had 3 Dates and at the end of the last Date I'd say I confessed her my feelings. I wrote that in that way, because I just told her, that I really like to be with her and that I like her very much. 

Because we both have almost no experiences in dating this moment was quite embarrassing. But I did it and she respond that she also likes to be with me and she also likes me very much.

Now we are planning our 4th date.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway the point, why I want to post this is the following.

I plan to open up to her a lot. I want to tell her what I feel and what I think. And in my head there is the idea to go a little further. She is a girl that doesn't write much (actually she hates chatting)

She is also quite busy at the moment. She works in the Kindergarden and this is closing in the next days, so she has much to think of and to do. Also her best friend marry this weekend and so she is on her wedding. And on top of that, her father has cancer, but in this case she doesn't seemed really bothered for now (she told me why, but for this post it is not really important).

So the last day I've heard from her was Wednesday. I asked her, when she has time for our next date and she told me that this week is full of other meetings (she is in clubs) and the next week she will go on holyday with his brother, but she don't know when exactly. she told me that she knows when we can see at weekend, but she really want to see me again. I don't doubt that, because the feeling I felt when I told her my feelings was real. I mean I felt that she also felt something. But this is not important for this at all.

I'm kind of an insecure person due to some events in the past. She knows that, and I already told her that I meet a therapist.

The reason why I tell you that is that I want you to know why I want to ask her how she feels and thinks about me between our dates. So I mean, I think very much of her. The whole day, I want to be with her, I want to speak with her, and so on. And I want to know if she also thinks that way. And if so, I want to know why she doesn't have the need to write with me.

But I'm afraid this could sound a bit creepy or so. So what do you think?

&amp;#x200B;

As I said I'm pretty inexperienced but I'm also very curious and want to know as much as possible. Therefor I also plan to ask her what was wrong with the dates before me (she had 2 or 3). I just want to know why it didn't work out for them. Is this a question for the 4th date, or would you wait with that? (I know this is not important, because she's seeing me, but I'm really curious)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/omawr6/talking_with_a_girl_about_feelings_and_past/
