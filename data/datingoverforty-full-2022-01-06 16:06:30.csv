I'm 40sM married to 40sF. Over the course of 12 years of marriage, I've come to realize that my spouse is never going to contribute her fair share. I will outwork her every day of the week. She won't plan things, won't make decisions, is generally unwilling to discuss things without a big blowup first. She is moody, although not unbearable.

I've tried to address this stuff. Not well received. I get either mockery, denial, or an attempt to address it and then nothing changing. Ive also tried to ignore it, and just not let it bother me. She refused to go back to work after the kids, and with COVID, I see now how she spends her days. It's about an hour of house work, and 8 hours of naps, texts, dog walks. Nice life that I'm subsidizing.  I dont really feel like I have a partner. 

On the other hand. It's not terrible. We mostly get along. It's not as thought life is unbearable here. I have thought a lot about ending things here. But I worry that maybe it's me. I am driven, I work a lot, I workout a lot. She is none of these things. She wants to be happy and coast through. 

We have kids. They are used to be traveling for work, and I like to tell myself that they will be ok if we split. I would obviously continue to be an involved parent. 

But worry is that I would be jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire. I enjoy having time alone (only child), but do I want that every day, day in day out? Do I want to be dating? Am I likely to find someone that makes this change feel worth it? I'm a romantic at heart (she is not). I would love to know that I will find my happily ever after. But, how likely is that?

So, from where you sit, knowing what you know now. Is it worth starting over? I'm not happy. I know this. But I'm not convinced that I would be much better elsewhere. 

Last thing. I'm reasonably attractive, early 40s, above average income (I'm self-employed), pretty outgoing, relatively fit. I'm ok with casual encounters, but the point of separating would be to find happiness first with myself, and eventually with a forever partner.

Hey, sorry but I’m going to take a raincheck on tonight’s date. Perhaps we can reschedule sometime…..

At this point I know I will never, ever meet this woman.

I have gone through this more times than I care to count. But here I am, dealing with another cancellation a mere 4 hours before the date.

I am annoyed. This type of behavior has become the norm, and I don’t like it.

Most of you reading this probably understand this all too well.

Here is some context - 

I (M50) am a musician with my shit together. On Hinge I get about 2-3 likes a day. I am not a model, but I would say I do pretty well.

OLD has become toxic. 

I am pretty serious in wanting to find a life partner, and I don’t understand the constant ghosting, cancellations, and lack of civility.

I make sure to be open and honest to anyone I am dating, whether I am interested or not. Doing the right thing should be the minimum one should expect from a potential date.

Just the other night a woman called me an asshole for telling her that we weren’t a match.

Why, you ask?

She used a lot of filters on her pictures, cat-fished me, and was high. 

Yet I was the asshole. 

Dating should be fun. You go out, have a couple of drinks and hopefully great conversations. It doesn't have to be that complicated. 

Maybe it works out, maybe it doesn’t. 

But at least you get to spend a few hours getting to know someone new.

That doesn’t even exist anymore. 

It’s not fun anymore.

The reality is that swiping, social media, and ludicrous expectations has turned us into entitled 

Idiots.

Never settle! They say.

If that is the case, then we will all die alone.

This is why I’m posting today. So he was visiting me today before we were going out for the evening. We were watching telly sitting next to one another on the sofa and he picked up his phone from the coffee table and was hunched over his mobile while checking it in such a way so I couldn’t see the screen. As moments before we were talking about where to go for dinner I had originally thought he was checking restaurants. Nothing of note my rational mind tells me. I have been cheated on by an ex in the past 5 years ago so I’m sensitive of any change of behaviour with phones. I told my insecure part of myself to back down, as I often do as I’m being silly nothing to worry about etc. What made me think something was a bit off was he normally sits back while looking through his phone. I’m not one to check someone’s phone screen even when someone is sitting next to me as I respect people’s privacy. As he was sitting in such a fashion for a good few minutes I let my curiosity win and I changed how I was sitting so I could see the screen. He was texting a woman. Now I know he has female friends as well as male and I’m not one to be jealous of my partner having female friends but I felt he was hiding this message chat from me for some reason. I felt confused. Lines of thought - Who is this person and so forth. Later at dinner he had a message and was reading through it he said a friend had sent him a news article. He opened the text as soon as it beeped even though we were talking. I told myself he has other friends it wouldn’t be the same friend. After dinner we went to the cinema and before the adverts came on his was texting, I looked over and it was the same woman from earlier and noticed a new article thing on the feed. Something else I took note this person was replying to his texts very quickly. Something else to note is that when he visited me after Christmas he was getting a good number of texts, I told myself most people are off work so they’ll want to get in touch. One time though we were watching a film on telly and I was talking to him about something as he didn’t respond I looked over and he was holding his phone next to his leg texting so I couldn’t see. I thought that was odd at the time now I’m wondering if something is up.

I know I’ve been a train wreck, but I actually got some good advice along with the negative judgement. I have been trying to get an appointment for STD checking, but the health department here locally is full on appointments for 6 weeks out. I’m looking into other options but one actually gave me a panic attack because it is service that sends you to the place where he works to get the urine and blood drawn.  

I was able to find his girlfriend’s phone number. I signed up for a free phone number service app, and I texted her from that. I sent pics of his Tinder profile, proof we matched, and an explanation that he was there, I’d slept with him, that she needed to get tested for STDs, and I said I was so sorry. 

She responded back asking when, denied it could have happened, I offered proof, then I sent it to her. 

She believed me. She confronted him and he said he never slept with me. I said “Well, he did. And if he’s lying about me, there are probably others, and you need to look out for your own health.” She called and asked questions, I answered honestly, and she said it all sounded exactly how he had gotten her.  She called him to the room, asked him again, he said he didn’t sleep with me. I maintained I’d sent her proof already, and I wasn’t 12 years old, so I’m not going to go back and forth about it. He knew what he did, as he most certainly did have sex with me. She had me on speakerphone, she said, “what do you have to say about that? …. That’s right, nothing, because you know you did it and so do I!”  

She said she was going to call me back. She never did, and honestly it doesn’t matter if she does. She knows everything now, so what she does is on her, what he did is on him, and they are none of my business anymore. 

I feel I did the right thing, despite making the wrong decision in the heat of things. I feel a huge sense of relief about that part but still super anxious about finding testing options. If anyone has ideas how I can avoid $600 lab fees in the US for full panel early testing, please reply here. I think many people in this community could benefit from this info. 

Also: Googling his images got me no information. He was not in the search results at all. Funny though that mugshots showed up for one of his pics and car seats for another (I laughed out loud at that. He was paranoid about his height and being shorter than me so I got a good snort out of it at least). 

I’ll probably never date again or talk to anyone else on these apps ever. I’m done. I’ll meet in real life or be single forever—and I don’t know if that even bothers me anymore as long as I never have to weed out this crap.

He said that he is genuinely enjoying spending time with me and wants to do so more, but because of past experiences doesn't rush into things-- I was happy we were on exactly the same page and we made plans for tonight.

Last night, he texted saying he has cold symptoms and cancelled our plans for tonight. This morning he got at home Covid tests, and dropped one off at my door. We both tested negative, so again I directly asked what this means for tonight and he still wanted to cancel (no surprise) saying just in case, for safety and didn't suggest rescheduling. I answered with ""sounds good. Be well soon.""

While it hurts to be rejected by someone I was truly enjoying getting to know and I do wish he could have matched my direct communication, I am super proud of myself for communicating directly and advocating for myself. Those things don't come easily to me.

We are both seeking long term serious relationship. A couple of years ago i came out of an extremely abusive marriage that lasted for 15 years. My ex husband was the only man i ever knew. I like him very much, and scared to do anything, scared to say anything more than “i like you” and he said the same. Fast forward Last week he calls and says, i really need to meet up with you, i don’t think we’re compatible, and mentioned along the lines something like “do you ever even call?” With quite a pissed off tone, then proceeded with i really like you and want to stay friends. I was quiet and replied i am not that person who can be friends. Yet, you are entitled to feel whatever you feel and i can only respect that. He insists we meet, i agree because i felt i need to say something too. We were supposed to meet last weekend, i told him the following weekend (which is tomorrow &amp; day after) will be my birthday weekend amd I don’t wanna do this on my birthday. I lost my job same day i got his call, he insists on helping me and called throughout the week to let me know he’s making calls….etc
I thanked him and thought that was kind of him. Now we are most probably meeting tomorrow, because of my terrible anxiety and i just go blank i wrote down literally a script of what i want to say. 
I think, because i poured my heart out in the past, I probably came off as I don’t care… i want to tell him how he made me feel, i poured my heart out amd wrote it all down.
How I felt with him makes me feel its worth trying. Im worried i’ll come off as needy and clingy. Im not asking for another shot, because he seemed like his decision was made.

My job involves a lot of critical thinking and problem solving and this week I disappointingly came up short on four elements. Need to decompress my brain so thought I’d see what everyone in here thought about this:

Do you have something that is continually brought up by those you date or in relationships with that seems to be a problem and how are you working on it?

For me it’s that I’m unimpressed with a lot of things that, according to feedback and observation, a lot of other women aren’t impressed by.

This has been brought up quite frequently. I just find it difficult to want to congratulate someone on communication, bringing me flowers, cooking dinner, being a good parent, scheduling time to see me…the list goes on. 

To be clear I do acknowledge these things but I guess my reaction isn’t big enough? I think it’s given me the appearance that I’m hard to please but I’m really not. I just want to be heard, stimulated and valued. Anything very much outside the norm I do have a big reaction to but normal every day things I just really don’t and feel a thank you should be enough. I say thank you and acknowledge effort on a regular basis I just think that my reaction isn’t big enough to them.

How I’m working on it? Still trying to decide if it’s something I should work on. So guess a bit of a stand still at the moment.

We went on a lunch date. As soon as he saw me he hugged and kissed me. After holding my hand across the table, I sat next to him and we were making out before the food even came at 11am🤣 point being, it certainly didn’t seem he wasn’t attracted to me in real life. 

From that point on, he threw up walls. He had his kids and would say he couldn’t talk bc they were there. They are teenagers. I have one. They don’t want to spend every minute with you. He still texted or called daily. 

We had plans for Christmas Day. I spent the entire day waiting for him (that morning he said he’d let me know when he was on the way). His phone was off. Finally at 8pm he responded to my text asking if he was still coming. He said “I’ll let you know after xyz” I asked “how did we go from having plans to ‘you’ll let me know’ at 8pm” I mean I would have been with friends had I known this. After that it was a slow fade until 5 days late he said “I had the best first date with you. You’re so intelligent, funny and kind. But I think we shouldn’t see each other anymore.”

Wtf happened? Did I do something wrong? I did keep texting him when his energy changed, but I slowed down eventually.

While I'm still sad, I've moved on from the relationship. 

Last month I (40M) ended a nearly 4 year relationship with my (ex)gf (37F). We met through my language teacher while I was working in China. Up until just before COVID started we got along great (but not perfect). 

I admittedly did not communicate my female (platonic) friends well with her, which started creating a lot of cracks in the relationship foundation. And I had two short term relationships that ended in utter disaster (will share at later time). It also didn't help that she knew I dated a lot prior to us meeting and her bff (who I don't get along) slept with pretty much any man that has a pulse. Eventually these factors created a lot of insecurities. I kept reminding her that she's amazing and tried to be very transparent with my communication with her. 

She's met my mother, closest relatives and friends, my friends and relatives were floored when, for the first time, I introduced her to them. Of the 38 years of my life (at the time), I've never introduced a woman whom I'm seeing to them. She was incredible and my family and friends loved her. I was ring shopping when first signs of relationship trouble started happening. 

While I went hiking with two of my female friends, we bumped into an ex, who I'll call S (a narcissist), while she's on her date. We were walking in direct path of one another. My two friends knew how much damage S had done to me during the short amount of time we were together. As S approached, one of my friends jumped onto me and gave me a hicky and said something along the lines of ""who would ever pass you up?!"" While the other friend (her sister) said ""you two are so cute together."" While a very much appreciated their protectiveness, I would've appreciated without the hicky. Before anyone thinks she's interested in me. Her and I had talked about our relationship before (before I even met my ex) and it's very strictly platonic (we originally did start out as dating, chemistry wasn't there, but we both had same type of humor).

My ex blew up over the hicky and wanted to confront my friend over it. My friend told her what had happen, but ex didn't really buy the story. She felt we had conspired together on the story. 

Ex: What are the odds of you running into someone you know in a city of 18 million people?

Me: Remember that crossfit photo I showed you where 3 people I dated were all in the same photo? Or about the story of bumping into college friends 1500 miles away from where we went to school? Or the time I bumped into this couple at the airport who I paired up hiking for safety? World is small when hobbies are the same. 

My friend ended up hanging up on her. I got dog housed for the week. 

When I found out I was being sent back to US I wanted to do some shopping before my things are shipped back (and I'm not a person who likes to shop). As word got out that I'm leaving, the first woman I had relationship with in China (let's call her K) reached out wanting to meet for lunch. I was very hesitant meeting her, but eventually agreed. Told my ex that I'm going to lunch with her and the restaurant we were going to. She was supposedly fine with it (one of those okay but not okay deal). At the restaurant, K wanted to share the news of her pregnancy and show off her baby bump with her fiancé. She didn't want to do it over WeChat video. I thought was weird but happy for her. However, had a miscommunication with the ex and went to the wrong meetup spot to go shopping. I ended up about an hour late and was accused of banging K.

From that point on she was a bit distant. I left China not having fully reconciled with her, but remained in relationship with her. 

Things started getting better over 2020 and most of 2021. Unfortunately, with the timezone difference, we can only really video chat on Friday and Saturday nights. We couldn't see each other in person due to US/ China tension and China was not doing tourist visas (my work permit in China expired). For her, US doesn't make it easy for single women in their 30s to visit. 

As places started opening up I stated traveling with my friend's family (ex had met them). To my ex, she thought it was weird that I'm hanging out with their family so much (true, but they were my only friends in 400 mile radius of where I lived. They lived 10 min away). Ex made a few passing remark that she thinks I'm dating their 22 y/o daughter. I kept reminding her I never date women more than 5 years younger than me. And I treat my friend's kids as if I had my own. It was when I started getting annoyed with her insecurities and told her I never had problems breaking up with someone if I don't believe it'll work out and I am very much in love with her. 

A month goes by I change job and moved across country. Thinking my new location will help ease her into US life (she's visited US 3 times), I told her, 

""I want you to visit US under K1 visa [90 day fiancé], but I can't promise you at the end of the 90 days I will marry you, but I want to give this a go. If it doesn't work out I'll pay for your airfare back and provide you 2 month living expense while you find a place and job.""

After a month's thought she called one evening explaining her feelings and that based on how my offer didn't express love and she would not risk coming to US. Also she felt it was odd that I had far too many female friends than male friends in China (most single guys in China didn't want to hang out with me) vs complete opposite in US.

There's a lot more to the story and I know what I've typed didn't do her true personality justice. 

TL;DR - Ex and I split in Dec after nearly 4 years over increasing insecurities starting with platonic female friends acting protective when I bumped into another ex (S) by acting overly affectionate via a hicky on my neck. Ex didn't buy the story. Another ex (K) wanted to announce her pregnancy and baby bump in person. Ex was okay at first, but when I went to the wrong meetup place, was accused of sleeping with ex (K). After returning to US, ex suspected I was dating friend's daughter. Ex didn't felt loved with my proposal to come to US (with no guarantee of marriage at end of 90 days despite covering her living expense if things don't work out).",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,65124,public,self,How my last relationship ended (long read),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ryvmfj/how_my_last_relationship_ended_long_read/,some_ads,7,e06d24a4-275e-11e9-9b74-0e6a6c05416c,Casual Conversation,,,,,,,

I’m in my early 40s and I am going through a divorce. I was with my husband for 20 years and discovered his secret lives to say the least.

For half my life he was my best friend, my lover, my spouse, my other half. We grew up together basically. I would have followed him to the ends of the earth. Then one day, my world shattered when I discovered that he basically had hidden secret lives with other women.

The marriage wasn’t perfect and he was abusive at times, well, really emotionally neglectful and mentally abusive at times and towards the end, it was out of control.

I decided to leave and it’s been a year and I still want to cry EVERYDAY. He’s moved on to his other girlfriends he had behind my back and I’m just here….on earth, depressed.

People say that I did the right thing to leave but I can’t stop thinking about how things used to be, how much I miss my husband or who he used to be or who I thought he was. I’m so depressed, all I want to do is sleep.

Pro say to get out and do things and meet people, but I’m not 20 years old anymore. I’m average looking so it’s not like guys flock to me either. I scared to date online as I’m sure it’s full of narcissist and I’m not trying to find another one.

How does one average 40-something “older” woman find their forever love? I know people say that you shouldn’t look for anyone, work on yourself, bla bla bla, but that’s just not me. 

It’s been a year already, I’m kind of an introvert, haven’t met anyone I’m semi attracted to to would even seem like their interested in me or looking for the same thing.

God I’m so depressed and lonely.
I wish I could have a lobotomy and erase every memory of my ex. It’s hurts so much to be just basically abandoned by the one who you thought you were gonna grow old together, by the one you you’re to talk to everyday. No longer have a home. Just barley scraping by so I’m not homeless.

No skills because I was a house wife for twenty years. My job was making him happy and making him a happy clean home everyday. That made me happy. I was the happiest when I was in his arms. That was my home, not a building. Now it’s all gone.

I’m just wondering if any of you guys ever went though this and how did you get through it. And please don’t flag this, I’m not going to hurt myself or anything, I’m way to chicken sh*t to do anything like that. I’m just expressing myself and trying to see if anyone here has had any similar experiences and see if you got through it.

Thank you for your time.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,65164,public,self,"I feel eternally lonely, depressed, &amp; hopeless.

I had no idea what this was until he gave me a tiny accidental tip off the other night that he's reading a book by Robert Greene which led me into a really gross place on the internet. 

I'd say I'm about 70% sure that he's been deliberate in his communication (or lack thereof), how he's planning/not planning our time together, and things he says to me. It works! 30% of me is so hooked on him that it's desperate for this not to be true. There's still a possibility that he's really bad at dating, scatter brained and closed off emotionally.

Either way, not a great guy to keep dating, I get it. I need to stop seeing him but these two scenarios require different exits:  
If he's playing me (!!) using some freaking internet guideline then 100% I should ghost/block/burn it down  
If he's just a lousy romantic partner, I think he deserves a conversation or explanation.

I should repeat that I am extremely interested in him. I'm a grown woman who thinks about a guy  ... every 2 minutes. Breaking up with him is not going to be easy for me either way (I failed the first time I tried to do it after my last post here-- he talked me into giving it more time to see)

And that his kids will be around a lot longer than any pet

After that I ended up ghosting the dude. But it was compiled by other things. Focusing on my physical appearance and sexist comments about women , that were all red flags. 

But for me , not liking animals or understanding them is a deal breaker. I get if someone had been bitten by one , being scared. But not actively disliking. Makes me think you’re potentially a sociopath lol. 

Anyone else feel strongly about this ?
