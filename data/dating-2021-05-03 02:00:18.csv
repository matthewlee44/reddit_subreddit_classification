1,n3q8vg,1620026309,Unsure how I (26F) should proceed with this person and how he (35M) feels. Advice?,"Had been talking to this guy for a few months prior to the meeting. He said he is open to a relationship but not with anyone (same). I ended up thinking that he was a bit too forward in the kindest way and I had gotten out of a relationship a month or so beforehand. We had some really great chats. I think he took it a bit negatively and blocked me on social media. I had noticed that he unblocked me on social media so I reached out saying it was probably a miscommunication. He responded positively and we had our first date. Said to me to come to his which we did, we ordered food to his (very gentlemanly sort of guy), attracted to each other, great chats again and we went on a little evening picnic. We both have similar interests in academic stuff. We only kissed that night. I got to his around 6 pm and left almost 12 hours later. He offered that I could stay the night but we could sleep in separate rooms or he was happy to drive me home but it was late, so he ordered an uber for me. We both are quite busy and we had our second date a few weeks later. He said it would be nice to hang again.

Anyway, the second date comes, I got to know him a bit better and he mentioned that we're quite similar. Joked that we both mumble a lot. Ended up sleeping together, not a selfish person, cuddled afterwards and had our good chats. The date went really long like last time and I got an uber home. He messaged me asking if I was okay and to send me the details of the driver. We have been in contact via social media a bit since.

I'm just unsure whether he should be the one that expresses what he wants in person or do I mention that this is what I'm after. He works till the evenings throughout the week and weekend so it seems that I can only see him after work hours.He reached out asking how I am, days went by and I started to think that I didn't like it how I wouldn't know when I was going to see this guy again and that if it's not meant to be, it's all good. Immature but I sent him a text saying that I didn't like it how our two dates consisted at just his house and that I'm often left not knowing when I would see him again, I said I don't have expectations around texting.

He said he would talk to me the next day as he had a lot on his plate and he is sorry for not mentioning when he would like to see me again in the manner it deserves. I knew the answer wouldn't be good so I deleted him off my social media. He sent me a very rude message the next day saying I was immature, we ended up calling and he said that he thought he would be open to a relationship but he thinks he cannot provide what I would like. I then said to him that I've only met him twice and I'm unsure myself but I do like to know when I'm with someone if they would like to see me again such as 'this was great, when are you free next?' and weirdly he said he felt the same with me. He also said something along the lines of that he doesn't hear from me for days and is unsure of how I feel. He said forget the relationship talk, that he likes me and thinks I'm cool but he asked what my expectations were regarding texting and said he would like to see me again. He said we don't also have to be sexual when we catch up, we can be friends or anything. He told me that he's meanest to the ones he likes the most. He jokingly said that I'm so annoying when we were bantering over something.

The next day I said I would like to see him again but I would not pressure him but I understand if he doesn't as I don't want to waste my time. I apologised for blocking him. He rudely responded and said ""I don't want to deal with this f\*\*king bull\*\*\*\* right now, name. I said I've been accommodating enough and to not contact me again. He replied saying 'f\*\*\*\*\* off, mate' and blocked my number and on WhatsApp.

TL;DR guy that I would have liked to have seen again has proved to be quite unstable. Unsure whether I've done the right thing but not ever going to talk to him again. We unfortunately are very similar and have similar interests. I've noticed that he's been blocking a lot of people on his Instagram. Unfortunately, we get along really well in person but do have a habit of overtalking each other and that was evident in the last phone call we had. I had to resort to saying 'I'll give you 30 seconds' and then you can talk etc.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n3q8vg/unsure_how_i_26f_should_proceed_with_this_person/

So basically I have a bad history in my dating life. This year a girl asked me out about few months back in January. She seemed really genuine at first and she is obviously really good so we both started dating. Last week we shared our social media accounts (instagram). I kinda wanted to know a bit about her past life relationship so I tried to find the message box of her ex. I got in and it was pretty ugly. Now here interesting things come up. She admits to be really into me and wants to have a serious relationship with me and I wanted the same too rather than just hooking up and go away. 

In the ex's message from way back they were asking questions each other and the guy asked her how many relationships she was in by now - she said casual relationship - 6 and serious - 0. Interesting thing is she told me she had 2 relationships only. My insecurities grew. I also found another guy chat which seemed like a pretty serious relationship texting. Nothing more than after that.

I looked more and more and I found more lying stuff as in she told me I was the first guy she kissed ( I didn't wanted to buy that but she assured me) then I found a text where they were talking about a truth or dare kiss and she said to the guy that it was annoying and get lost and whatever.

One particular thing I notice is she practically texted everyone (I want to justify this a being very social) I did find 2-3 pics which seemed like a date with some dude but the chats were contradictory.

Now comes the juicy part - there was a particular guy who was considered as friends with benefits shit about an year back (my gf told me about him) and I found some bad sexting and shit. What interested me was the guy called her a ""playgirl"" as in a girl who parkours out of relationship really fast. 

She did lie to me about having less exs. But her defence might be she shared her social media to lemme know her history or something. And my past relationships (particularly one resembles the same kind of situation but the girl was really fucked up in that one.). Something in the back of my head says ask her and she must have some good justification which can relief me from my over thinking insecurities and I shouldn't be insecure too at any cost.

Lately, we've been going out more and our ""dynamic"" isn't focused around sex as much as it used to.

However, it's still a big part since we both have a pretty high sex drive. Unfortunately, I'm not able to have sex with him for like 10 weeks (we're at week 7 now).

I've told him at the beginning that it's more than okay with me if he wants to stop meeting up, and that he should meet others. Which, he declined and sais that it's not a long time.

Lately, I've noticed that he's texting other girls (which is more than okay with me since we're not in a relationship). But yesterday, while I was sucking him off he was keep on texting with someone, which idk you just don't do that???

That's why I thought he doesn't want this anymore, but doesn't want to hurt my feelings idk. So, I told him today that there's nothing holding him back, he should just go and meet others.

I never really put forth much effort into dating because of constant rejection and poor self-esteem.  After becoming more self-aware, I decided to start making changes in my life to better myself and my circumstances.  I started eating healthier, exercising 6 days a week and started CBT therapy.  I consider myself a much improved person mentally, socially, physically and spiritually.  

I started dating my first girlfriend around a year ago but broke things off with her after learning about her sexual past.  From there I’ve learned that it’s very hard for me to date because I’m very uncomfortable about a potential partner’s past.   This makes things almost impossible because almost every woman in my age bracket has been with multiple people.  I’ve tried to just get over it but it’s not that easy.  I’ve brought this up in therapy multiple times but nothing seems to be working.

I’m more upset with myself than anything because I’m a late bloomer and feel like I’m weird because I’ve only been with one person in my entire life.  

I don’t mean to ramble on.  Guess I’m just looking for a friend to talk to about this or any sort of guidance.  If you feel like helping, I’d greatly appreciate it.

32,n3urgu,1620044992,Women aren’t great at giving advice to men on dating,"
This is going to get downvoted but whatever i feel like it needs to be said.

Because of how different dating is for men and women, women usually are very bad at giving dating advice to men. In dating women are allowed to be passive. They aren’t expected to ask guys out, make plans, pay for dates, et cetera. 

Men are expected to make all of that magic that happens in the early stages of dating happen. Whether this is fair or not is irrelevant. But this objectively is the way things are today. This isn’t to say dating for women is effortless but it takes significantly less effort than dating as a man.

Because of this I don’t think many women understand how dating as a man is. Most men slog through constant rejection (which in a lot of men leads to other issues), the pressure of being the one that has to make things happen, and the feeling of being replaceable because, let’s be honest we are to most women when it comes to dating. Most women could find a date every night for a year, so they really can just replace one man when he doesn’t meet their standards, guys don’t have the same luxury.

As an example I like to use some commonly said dating advice that I typically see coming from women.

“You’ll find it when you stop looking for it”
This is so untrue for most guys, as most guys need to be the ones making the first moves for a relationship to happen. If they just stop looking for it they’ll end up single

“Work on yourself and you’ll find someone naturally”
This isn’t bad advice I just don’t think it’s true for men. Men need to work on themselves but most won’t find someone through that. It’s the same as the previous example, if you work on yourself and put no effort towards dating, you’ll be ignored for the guys that are actually giving women attention.

It just feels wrong. So many men have so much pain, and they have to pay in order to have someone do what, criticize them while they continue to bear the burden? Therapists are trined to detach from a person's problems. They can't connect, because they are trying to find constructive ways to help. Having a support network means having ways to bond and feel ""like the World isn't so bad after all"". It helps a person to process their pain and move past it. 

American society seems to want to blame men for a lot of bad behavior, but they don't seem to want to support them when they are hurting. Kind of funny how that works.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n3vxy1/gender_bias_with_support_networks/

43,n3w8zn,1620049046,Please recognize the difference between having standards and having requirements.,"This goes out to all genders and all sexual orientations. When choosing a partner we have a tendency to have a checklist of prerequisites that we look for before even considering whether or not to date that person. We also have a tendency to refer to these prerequisites as ""standards"" when in fact they're ""requirements"", and yes there's a difference and it matters. 

For starters it's good to have standards. We all have standards for ourselves and it's good to want those standards in a partner. Is it good to have requirements though? Well it depends. Too many requirements can reflect how shallow or narcissistic a person is. If you don't mind being shallow or narcissistic then have all the requirements you want. But if knowing that you are shallow or narcissistic bothers you, then you need to take a hard long look at your requirements and ask yourself if it's worth it to have these requirements at the expenses of your own self worth and reputation.

So the easiest way to tell the difference between a standard and a requirement is to pay attention to the language you are using when you say what you want from a partner out loud. If you say that you want a partner who believes in a certain concept, or you want a partner who thinks a certain way, those are standards. However if you're saying that you want a person who ""is"" a certain way or you want a person who ""has"" a specific thing or status or position, then those are requirements. 

Some examples would be saying ""I just want a partner who thinks love is more important than sex"" is a standard. Saying ""I just want a partner who's body is in good shape"" is a requirement. Saying ""I want a partner who is willing to talk about our problems before walking away"" would be a standard. Saying ""I want a partner who has at least a bachelor's degree"" is a requirement. Saying ""I want a partner who believes in the same religion as I do"" is a standard. Saying ""I want a partner who makes good money"" is a requirement. If it serves a physical or functional need, then it's a requirement. If it serves a principle or belief, then it's a standard.

Once you recognize the difference you can stop labeling your requirements as standards and hopefully recognize that what you want are a list of conditions that must be met. Now as I said before it's not necessarily bad to have requirements, but having too many can make you seem too superficial. Is it okay to require your partner to have a job? Well that's up to you to decide but if you require that your partner hold a certain title at their job or make a certain amount of income, well now your requirements can be viewed as shallow. It's up to you if you care or not if you are perceived as shallow or not, but if it bothers you, try recognizing that you do have shallow needs and decide how much are you willing to change yourself. If you have certain requirements and it bothers you that you may be shallow for having those requirements, try relaxing those requirements a bit. Recognize that the more requirements you have, the less attractive you become.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n3w8zn/please_recognize_the_difference_between_having/

I’ve been with a few people I feel like I have cared for deeply to call it love but I don’t think it was. I don’t think they ever truly saw me, if that makes sense. I give my all to a person and that just who I am, but I think they only payed attention to what I was doing for them. I’ve been through so much, I used to just throw myself at people, be around people to avoid being alone. Surrounding myself with people who were not good for me, I was in a bad space, it didn’t matter who they were, the only thing that mattered was what I was getting out of it.

I want to fall in love, and I mean truly fall in love with someone. I want to know what that’s like, I want to know what it means to have a person like that.

We had fun in the beginning but right now it's crunch time for the finish line for grad school and I think that and the whole covid affected our energy dynamic. I am more low energy, awkward, and monotone (basically can't be myself) and she's the same and more venting. So basically that's how we were in the last irl date. At the end I asked how she feels about dating and she replied with basically with our dynamic/personality she sees us more of friends. We talked a little bit about how things might have been different had it been non covid and we are on campus together and our dating approaches. She is very old fashioned and needs alot of time before opening up on top of me being the first guy she's dated past a couple weeks. I walked her to her car, she asked for a hug and we said goodbye. 

When we got home I called and communicated to her how I felt. Basically I needed to focus on school and some personal stuff and I couldn't put the energy into dating and also asked if she was willing to try again once we graduate. She said this wasn't an answer she could give on the spot because as of right now it would be a no but she will really think about it and text me. We talked a little bit (awkwardly lol), she said that it took alot of courage to tell her that, and said goodbye. My approach right now is to give her and myself space. But maybe after 1-2 weeks I would like to text her something light hearted or wishing her well because this program is pretty intense and stressful. 

Do you guys think what I said regarding my own feelings on the situation waa innaprorpiate considering we weren't official or anything? Right now I do feel embarrassed putting that out. Also do you guys think I should even contact her at all after that?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n3zkfh/was_this_phone_call_appropriate/
63,n3znyv,1620057449,Anyone know if someone can locate my whereabouts through dating apps?,"Hey maybe this is a stupid question but bear with me! Yesterday I was getting off the bus to visit my bf when a guy with a mullet in an old beat up truck pulled in near the gas station I was walking by and asked me if I knew where 1st Ave was. I asked him if he meant downtown Seattle and he said ""yeah I'm from Federal Way"". I told him he needed to get back on I-5 South but it was weird because if he was from Federal Way he would've drove right through downtown and then some but whatever. I turned to go and he asked me for a cigarette which I gave him starting to feel like a charity case here haha. He tried to give me a dollar, I said no but he forced the issue so much I finally just took it. I said good luck and turned to go again but he looked a little, I dunno, almost surprised like I had cut him off and just as I was about to leave he says this: 

""Well then, you have a  good night, Angela..."". And from the corner of my eye he flashes me this huge grin. 

So my question is...I clearly clearly heard him say my name and I do NOT know this guy...is it possible for someone to find you with one of those dating apps? That was the only thing I could think of. I don't have them on my phone anymore and hardly used them when I did but the whole interaction was very intentional feeling.

And i kept waiting for her to pass by again so i can approach her and tell her how i feel and give her my gift
And after 4 days of waiting, i saw her again and i did, even though i was so nervous but i approached her, told her i like her, gave her the gift and walked away right after she took it without asking for her name or giving her mine
She hesitated a little bit to accept it obviously because she doesn't even know who I am but i told her to accept it and i will just walk away,
She kept saying ok you like me what then??*(she meant what do you want from me now that you like me)*
I said take my gift and i will walk away 
So i did
What should I do next then,
Should I wait for her to call or at least text me on WhatsApp?
Or should I approach her again? And if so what should I do?

She’s also kind of a close friend of mine too and before they started dating I would occasionally handout with her when my brother or anyone else from the group has not been keen to join us. I don’t want things to change now as they are dating but I am feeling that it might bother him that she would hang out with me now even when he’s not around too. Also whenever she’s around and it’s the three of us (I live with my brother, so that happens a lot) she would spend way more time talking to me than him (me and her seem to have a lot more in common that she has with my brother) and sometimes I can see that he will act differently towards me after she leaves. Like he would completely ignore me and even pretend I’m not around and just be quite rude towards me in everything he does or says to me. And i really don’t feel like I’m doing anything wrong here. To me it just seems that he is just very insecure and acting jealous, but I would be curious to hear what other people think and if this is normal?

I really don’t want him dating our friend to affect my relationship with him and with her but I feel like that’s actually what’s gonna happen. Or him acting insecure might push her away and make her end their relationship and in my brother’s eyes it will be my fault.

We both had crappy partners in the end and have been each other's first in a lot of regards. She says I'm easy to communicate with, we don't fight, show each other affection and much more. Lots of simple things we both got that each other never had. Fun under the sheets is great to. I for 1 enjoy it more them every 2 months now. Long story short things are amazing.

Here's the catch 22. We hardly got anything in common. I'm a big nerd into D&amp;D, games and I write animation and do IT for a living. She's got a kid (15 F) and is mainly into bingo and meat raffles. We both agree we love walking (Not had the time for one yet) and movies but that's about it. We've cooked together, helped each other with chores so on. So still pretty good. 

After a chat we both had we found out we on the same both thought wise. She would like a kid before she's 40 and she wants to stay in small town in the middle of no where as she has been here her whole life, I think she is to scared of change. I moved here bout a year ago as family here and they helped me back on my feet. So I don't want to stay here forever. I also don't want kids this late in my life (personal preference). 

We've both agreed compromise is an option down the track and we want to give each other more time as we are still not sure on each other for lifetime partners.

While there have been some reasons to raise an eyebrow from time to time, I do not have a legitimate basis to really feel this skeptical of my GF or anyone else I have dated for that matter.

&amp;#x200B;

Heres the hard part, and why I don't want anyone to feel bad for me. I'm the asshole in this relationship. I dont treat her poorly, infact quite the opposite. I shower her with quality time and affection. But, I got into it because I was lonely, and the pandemic really cut dating and sex out of my life and i truly felt desperate. Other than the fact that Ive now spent 4-5 months with this girl and developed some level of emotional attachment, there is so much lacking in her and in the relationship, that I know I wouldnt put up with if i felt more secure with my prospects outside of her and I together. 

I am an objectively good looking guy, and have recently really come into myself socially. But my anxiety with new women is still crippling, and I don't have many friends in the city where I live. I don't know what to do. 

I am just so sad, and feel guilty. This girl is falling in love with me, and here I am just going through the motions. And yet DESPITE that, I still cannot help but feel incredibly insecure and anxious about her fidelity. Why do I care so much if I don't even really feel I care about her that much. I know I suck, I just want some truth thrown my way.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n4362q/can_someone_please_explain_what_the_frick_is/
93,n43aps,1620066076,I get bummed out when a girl I like loses interest in me,"I've recently been getting back into the dating game recently. I've had some dates with a few different people. The first girl, I got ghosted after 3 dates and we never hooked up. That kinda hurt because we spent a lot of time building a connection. she made a lot of misleading statements (said I was everything she was looking for) and then she just iced me out.

 Most recently I hooked up with this girl twice and we seemed to get along. Tbh I would have been happy to keep it as a casual thing but I feel like she lost interest in me. Where she would reply almost instantly she takes a few hours now. I think I'm just gonna leave it and move on.

I guess these things are to be expected, dating is a minefield. It's just a bit disheartening and although I keep my chin up and carry on, I do feel a bit hurt whenever a girl I like loses interest in me. 

What are your experiences with this? Any wisdom you've picked up along the way to make it sting a little less or any tips for dealing with it?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n43aps/i_get_bummed_out_when_a_girl_i_like_loses/

95,n43fp2,1620066404,"What’s going on here?? Does he (M24) just want to take things slow, is he shy, not confident sexually, and or does he not want me(F24)"," Does this guy actually like me? We have been talking a little over a month now. He (24) is sweet and I (f24) think he is a bit nervous and shy. Things are incredibly slow. We kiss, but it seems odd. It’s very small swallow like kisses... and I tend to catch him with his eyes open sometimes. He doesn’t hold me really tight when we hug.

So we went to a baseball game with his two best friends (Hunter and James) and Hunter’s girlfriend. It was a good time. But my date (Mark) talked more to his buddy that also sat next to him than me. He is super into baseball and he is really close with his friends. I could tell he was more comfortable talking with them. But it felt awkward because the couple was very much into their own conversation. So I sat there silently trying to watch the game. No arm around the shoulder, occasionally a hand on my knee. It was a good time and we all laughed and joked. But my date found it easier to chat with his friends.

Then he invited me to his baseball game. He lit up more when he saw his friend James than me. He came over and talked with us and he was more interested in joking and chatting with his friend. No hug or anything, no touching when he saw me. I invited both of them to lunch and paid the bill. My treat. 

I was invited to their friends’ (Paul and Dan) pool to drink and swim after lunch. I accepted and we had a great time. He was a little more open to affection with me. Liquid courage or he was making it known to the other guys I was with him. 

Well, all five us of got drunk (Mark, James, Dan, and Paul). I found out my date had hyped me up A LOT, but with the wrong information. Wrong car and wrong profession. I laughed and joked. I thought it was hilarious, but I did feel a bit ashamed. I wasn’t the person he hyped me up as, was I not okay and good enough as I was? Mark is more silent than his friends. Later when it was getting late and time to call it a night they started arranging what was going to happen. They started to get pushy and said they would drop me and my date off at his place and his roommate James was going to stay with the friends we were drinking with. They started getting bolder and basically telling us to have sex and different things. It was funny and I was secretly down for it. I wanted to. My date didn’t say anything to any of their remarks. 

We went back to Mark and James’s house with Paul to be dropped off. My date started to fuss with the laundry he had been stressing about and wanted to. Down the hall was a straight shot into their bedroom. James goes in there and starts to show off the handcuffs he had and puts them out for us. Saying he wasn’t giving up his comfy bed for nothing and hoping we would go at it. Paul and James complimented me saying how much they liked me and how cool I was. Telling Mark he picked a good one. 

They leave and my date was flustered with Paul (apparently he didn’t like him) and with his laundry. He told me I didn’t have to stay the night if I didn’t want to and not to let them pressure me. I declined and said I’d like to stay if that was okay with him. We go to the bedroom and lay on the bed. It was awkward at first not cuddling, but I just lifted his arm and put it around me and put my head on his chest. He liked this and picked a movie. We both fell asleep soon into it. He woke up when the movie ended and saw I was still asleep and gave me a kiss on my neck and then my forehead. I kind of woke up from that and smiled and curled back into him. He didn’t make any moves or anything. He kept his crotch away from my back side when we were spooning. He didn’t really even put his arm under my head. But he did wrap one arm around me and kind of grabbed my boob on accident and pulled his hand away when he noticed. 

We slept and awkwardly cuddled that night. We kissed a little before I left by the front door. Again the awkward kissing. 

He hasn’t made any sexual remarks or hints at anything toward me. No indication he wants me that way. 

What’s going on here?? Does he just want to take things slow, is he shy, not confident sexually, and or does he not want me?

I'm at the point where I feel I need to ask what's going on. But I don't want to make things weird or seem like I'm only interested in sex. I really enjoy my time with him. But my number one love language is Physical touch and I'm feeling a bit lost with the signals.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n43fp2/whats_going_on_here_does_he_m24_just_want_to_take/

97,n43uwz,1620067397,ghosted even though he seemed really interested in something serious?,"TLDR: guy seems very interested in a more committed thing with me initially and deletes apps, however after hooking up a few times i made a comment about him being selfish and now i am being ghosted 

initially talked to this guy for about a week and he came on really strong and showed a big interest in me, we would text paragraphs to each other and the conversation was really good. he really wanted to meet up so we met up last monday. 

during the date it also went really well, he told me that i ticked off all the boxes for him and we we had some really deep convo and found a lot of similarities with our childhood and experiences. he went as far as deleting the bumble app because he told me he was happy just talking to me. 

i live far away from him and was originally going to go home but we ended up talking so late until about 3am that i slept over. we ended up hooking up and the next day i hung out at his place as i had work to do and we still were talking a lot and later that night he took me out to eat and we ended up just really vibing with one another.

he texted me that night and the next morning saying he had an amazing time and was looking forward to seeing me again and set a date for friday. we still were talking a lot but i noticed his tone did change every so slightly however we were still communicating a lot.

second date comes around, he pickups me up from my city which is a 45 min drive from him, drops probably over 100 on snacks food and drink and we head back to his place to hang out. from here, he ended up ripping his bong which i found kind of weird but chalked it up to it being a friday and him having a busy day. from here the vibes were just off, idk if he was too high but we weren’t connecting and it felt awkward. we ended up hooking up twice that night and all of the times we hooked up i found he was quite selfish and ended up busting super quick. the last time we hooked up during the night i made a comment saying he’s selfish which he laughed awkwardly to but we still ended up being ok. 

fast forward to the next day, we’re still talking normally but it just feels weird. i leave his appt and he doesn’t text me and i shoot him a text late at night which he delivers a dry response to. i texted him again the next day asking i if i had done something wrong which he ignored. 

did i fuck up here? did i fuck up by fucking on the first date which ruined the chance of a relationship and did i fuck up by making the comment about him being selfish?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n43uwz/ghosted_even_though_he_seemed_really_interested/
98,n43x1x,1620067535,Girl advice needed,"So at university I met a mutual friend at a gathering and we hit it off and she made was clearly interested in me she'd constantly initiate conversations on social media  and always catch her staring at me when we're in a social setting  even my friends meeting her for the first time made comments about how it was obvious she liked me, however I was seeing someone else at the time and didn't give her my full attention, however, I've recently broken up with my girlfriend and we attended another gathering, she asked to me come sit next to her at the table constantly touching my legs moving closer , intense eye contact  we were chatting for an hour, and someone asked her is she seeing ___ she just said I'm kind of seeing someone,  and when the guy she was seeing turned up someone was teasing her  "",ohh your boyfriends here"" and she said ""he's not my boyfriend"" , like she was embarrassed or something.

99,n44074,1620067732,It’s looking like I’m never going to attract anyone I’m attracted to so what’s the point in dating?,"You might say I need to lower my standards. But barely anyone finds me attractive and it’s not even close. You may tell me I have unrealistic goals, maybe so. But I feel like my only option is to have 0 standards. To just say fuck what I’m actually attracted to or anything close to it, I’ll just take literally anything I can get. Because I really can’t get much. The question at that point is why? If I’m not attracted to them and we wouldn’t be happening otherwise, why should I make that happen? It’s probably better to stay single than force something crazy like that.

You may say I need to work on myself. Okay. But I’m always working on myself. You advising that isn’t changing anything because it’s already happening. I’ve been progress minded for about 20 years of adulthood and I’ve seen lots of progress because of it. When is it enough? I’m not supposed to say this but I think I’ve become an extremely valuable part of society. I think I’ve done well. Some people seem to think any guy with any significant value of any kind will easily get a girlfriend. Cause that’s just how it works, they say. But that’s not how it works. Plenty of people can attest to that. Just because that would make sense doesn’t mean it actually explains everything. I think the truth is no one really knows how it works. They just have their experiences and make assumptions.

I’m 33 now. At a certain point you’ve been trying long enough that you can make certain assumptions. Like “apparently my odds are not good at all.” Cause no matter what I’ve done for over 20 years I’ve got nothing to show for it. That’s a reasonable assumption in those circumstances.

So it is what it is. I never was a popular kid. I never was widely seen as beautiful. And I’ve never been particularly attractive to much of anything. If I was still trying to be popular at this point and dwelling on that all the time, I’d be a huge mess. Maybe I should stop trying to attract people as well",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n44074/its_looking_like_im_never_going_to_attract_anyone/
