Turns out that this friend is my super hot masc non-binary date for later this week (NB23). Not only did they talk about me but they were asleep on this girl's couch as we were talking.

So I go to this person's instagram and follow and am going through their pictures when I see that another queer person I'm talking to (NB22) is in their comments leaving lusty comments.

She said she usually talks a lot and I said that's perfect for me as I don't. Anyway after the show we went on a long walk where we got to know each other better. When we got in front of her building I wanted to kiss her but as I had never kissed a girl before I was too afraid I would fuck it up so I only asked if I could hug her. She said yes we hugged and I asked if she was free tomorrow for another date. She said yes and I said I'd contact her. That night I proposed that we go watch a movie and she accepted.

Movie was ok, I tried holding her hand while we watched it but again couldn't muster up the courage. After the movie it was pretty late so I drove her home. She invited me in saying we could watch some stand up and drink hot cocoa because I had mentioned I like it. We went in, watched a short stand-up clip and then she dimmed the lights and got closer to me. After a very awkward time where I didn't know what to do, I asked if I could kiss her. She said yes, we kissed a few times, this was for me my first kiss, and I mentioned that to her afterwards. She was very understanding through the whole thing and said it's fine if I'm a beginner. After my awkward attempts at holding her and kissing her we tried french kissing quite a few times and then I had to leave as her roommate was gonna show up soon.

Well, this was on Sunday, today, Monday morning I left her a Morning &lt;3 text, when she woke up she replied with a very long text telling me how she only got tinder to meet new people and have fun, she mentioned she thinks I might have feelings for her and doesn't want to hurt me, she said a few more things and I told her I'm not sure how I feel about her yet but also that I like her company. Now...It's true that I am not exactly sure about my feelings however this girl is all I ever dreamed, I really love spending time with her, she makes me happy and I would love to pursue a relationship but since she made it clear she doesn't want that should I just move on?

I stumbled upon a job posting for an online matchmaking company. Although I had never been a matchmaker before, I had dated A TON in my personal life and have a lot of customer service experience, so thought, 'hey why not give it a shot'. After four interviews (I wish I was kidding) I got the job. After extensive training I began working with a team of writers, photographers and coordinators, as a matchmaker for elite clients around the world. Essentially what we do is manage their online dating accounts for them. Swiping, messaging with matches and setting up dates on their behalf. Basically all the clients have to do is show up on the dates. There are several packages ranging from several hundred dollars per month to several thousand per month USD! My clients run the gamut, 20s to 70s, women, men, gay, straight, queer, from several countries (but mostly American), and different professional backgrounds- writers, tech people, doctors, lawyers etc. While I definitely think this is a great service and is really helpful to a lot of people, I found it obscenely expensive and completely out of reach for regular people.

The more I learned as a matchmaker, the more I realized that online date is EXTREMELY FORMULAIC. I found it sad that while this formula is not overly complicated or nuanced, it is so inaccessible to the majority of people. Anyone who doesn't have several hundred (or thousand) extra dollars per month isn't able to access this formula. I really believe that there is someone for everyone. I know a lot of people have given up on online dating, or even dating all together because they find it too discouraging. Without the right strategies, online dating really is a waste of time for a lot of people, especially men. But, there is a better way!

I decided to put everything I know into an online course, put it up online at an accessible price and make this knowledge available to everyone. If this course helps even one person find love (or lust ;) I will consider it a success.

We hit it off and felt very attracted to each other, great conversations, intimate talks etc. . I clearly fell hard for her than she did. 

A little bit about myself. I rarely flirt or chase women. Honestly, I did not get attracted to a lot of women till now. My brain shows me something that make women unattractive and they just become as good as stones however hot they maybe. Recently, I felt the need for a romantic partner, realizing a void, wanted someone closer &amp; intimate than the closest friend at all levels and started looking for potential partners. I have talked to a few women, but I didn't get a feeling to continue even when they were physically attractive, had sorted career etc.

Then I met this girl accidentally, the first 2-3 days after the meeting were nothing special even I was not sure. But, as the conversations progressed I knew her more and wanted her more. She is nice, independent, kind, has a great personality, shares similar ideas of relationship. She ticked all the right boxes and my brain let me fall for her. I started feeling greater affection as time progressed. I fell in love madly. I could not even look at any other girl, because my brain whispered you have the best girl in the world, what more you need. 

She also wanted someone who is passionate about her. She also knows that I am exactly what she is looking for. But, here comes the twist. She loves me but she feels guilty that she is not able to feel the same level of affection. She makes time for the dates and conversations in whatever time she has. I also don't mind it, she has her commitments and a life to live. She is worried that if she lets this continue, I will grow even more closer to her and if this relationship does not work out, I will end up getting hurt. So she wants to end this now. I tried explaining to her in every way, but she is hell bent on her current thought. She wants me to find someone who can reciprocate my love with the same amplitude. Can we find similar reciprocation ever? Note that I enjoy loving her, and very happy with how things are progressing. Her presence itself is a kind of enjoyment because of various things she does.

I don't want to lose her. I am willing to take things slowly. I have a strong feeling that we can be perfect partners. To me she is  extremely precious. From her perspective, I am special, therefore she cannot afford to hurt me by continuing this.

So, regrettably, I went out with a customer of the restaurant I work at. He hangs out with regulars I’ve known for a couple years so I figured it was safe. It was stupid, I know better, I let my guard down. 
I wasn’t interested for many reasons after our one date, but because of the customer/employee power imbalance I decided to tell him I wasn’t interested in giving time because of my schedule. I most likely gave too much information, saying I’d like to refocus my priorities, main one being  developing a career skill. This is technically true, but he doesn’t know I’d be willing to have a partner during a that if they were very right for me. 
He pulled me aside one day when he came in to tell me that he will take any time I can give him, and I told him I felt like it’s better to not be enmeshed if we aren’t working toward anything. It seems like he wanted, in a way, to manipulate me to developing feelings if he offered a more casual approach. I didn’t like this, but it felt good that I very plainly rejected the idea. 
Up until yesterday, I felt like seeing him at my workplace was maybe a little awkward but we are cordial, so I felt okay about it overall. He has texted me a few times, which I’ve ignored. 
As he was going to leave yesterday, he very plainly says, “What have you been up to? You’ve been blowing off my last few texts.” True. I did. I really didn’t know what to say. 
This pissed me off. Why in the hell do I have to respond to you? 
I just told him I’m busy and don’t have the time.

Hi! I met a guy about 1.5 months ago. He is kind, caring, consistent, interested and making a true, concerted effort.   
However, he says he can't truly enjoy being physically intimate unless he has it without a condom. For our 4th date I went over to his place, and I was ready to do the dead but whenever he put on a condom, he got soft, saying it was uncomfortable it. I asked him to get tested (a week before) and he did it (which was very sweet). I also saw the results and he is clean.   
But I've never not used a condom with a guy. So my question is, what would you do if you were in my place? He seems to really be into me, but the truth is I've only known him for less than two months. I don't know if he'll be with other women in the time we aren't seeing each other (between dates etc) and I don't know that I can trust him just yet that he won't (we have not had any direct conversations about being exclusive with each other). I won't be with anyone else between meetings because that just isn't me (I've had 2 sexual partners in my life, so sleeping around isn't my thing). Him though, I think he's capable (not sure if he'll want to) and I'm afraid to given in to go all that way without a condom. I'm also on birth control. I haven't allowed unprotected sex yet because our 4th and most recent date was the first date where we went all the way and it was also the date where he was very open about his desire to have sex without a condom. He did not force it on me, he did try, because he's a guy but if I said no, he would stop.   
How to move forward? Are guys who say they can't have sex without a condom, and get uncomfortable etc telling the truth? Is this something he can, in fact, control, and get over if it's about my comfort level?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1124776,public,self,Unprotected Sex,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qph93x/unprotected_sex/,no_ads,0,,,

Iv had more experience with casual dating and picking up in bars than most my age and I thought I’d provide my 3 rules which have resulted in respectful and pleasant interactions for all involved. 

This is from my perspective as a straight male but have helped friends of all persuasions with their endeavours. I feel these rules apply whether you’re promiscuous or just trying to talk to your crush in hopes of a happily ever after.

I will clarify, I have terrible luck in nightclubs. So this is more for pubs, bars, festivals and in general public. 

Rule 1: Eye contact. 

I can’t stress this enough. Eye contact is the single most important factor that determines whether approaching someone is even a possibility. I’m talking anything from a bit of linger when your eyes meet to full blown devouring. If you appear at someone’s side and they haven’t seen you before, or worse, have avoided making eye contact a couple of times, they will be immediately defensive. 

If you’re trying to pick up, let your eyes do the work. If someone likes the look of you then they will make themselves available to your gaze. They will be visible to you for a good portion of the time. 

The adverse is true also. If someone is open to some adventure for the night, their eyes will be doing the same. They’ll be seeking to find someone they like the look of and hold that gaze. 

Rule 2: Be yourself.

Why would you want to be a shallow, poorly written version of something you think you should be over the person you genuinely are. 

That’s exhausting and you will get tripped up on your lies. We all have flaws, don’t be afraid to some a little of them. If you’re a bit shy and bashful then be shy and bashful. 

If you’re a pickup line kinda person then go for it. As long as you’re not greasy about it then it will come across genuine. 

If you’ve had the eye contact and you’re now talking to them and it’s gone smoothly so far. Your job is to not mess it up. They’re interested, don’t give them too many reasons not to be. 

Rule 3..: I call it the rule of 3. 

You have effectively 3 topics/questions you can raise. If during these 3 prompts the person you’re talking to doesn’t initiate their own interaction. 

If they don’t delve into your discussion and if they generally don’t participate in the conversation. Then just wrap it up politely and move on. If the conversation is going smoothly and it dries up, go back to the rule of 3 and try to re-spark it, if not. Wrap up and move on. 

This will do two things. 

It will save your time and energy for someone who is interested. It may be that you read the cues wrong. Or they don’t like what you’re saying. Or your vibe doesn’t match theirs. What ever it is, it’s not a bad thing. Just move on. 

It will also stop your ego from flat spinning/spiralling out of control. We all like to be accepted and we all fear rejection. By doing this you can write the experience off as either a learning experience or just a pleasant conversation with a nice person. 

And that’s really it. From there it’s on you lovely people. 


Honourable mentions: 

Hygiene - For the love of god (fellas I’m looking at you here). Please wear clean clothes, wash before you go out, brush your teeth and keep some mints handy. There is no quicker way to turn people against you than a bad smell. 

Be polished - What I mean by this is try to present the best image of yourself as you can. Do your hair, wear some nice clothes, wash your shoes. This is as much for you as it is for anybody else. If you’re dressed good. Smelling good. Looking good. Then your confidence will be higher already. 

Fragrance - go easy on it. A spray on each wrist and dabbed on either side of your neck is all you need. It’s meant to be an intriguing aroma. Personal and intimate. People are meant to catch a wiff of it and wonder who has such a nice smell on. It’s not meant to tranquillise an elephant. Even the best smelling cologne/perfume will give someone a headache if it’s over applied 

Don’t be slimy - if you’re there just to get laid that’s okay. There’s bound to be a counterpart for you somewhere that night. But don’t let that be your dominating angle. 

And that’s it.

There’s a guy (24M) at my (24F) university whom I got pretty attracted to the first time we talked (some weeks ago). I haven’t had many opportunities to talk to him since then so I can’t really say I know him but he seems friendly enough and people seem to like him. 

This weekend I’ll be going to a fancy dinner event and I think (&amp; hope) he will be there too. Or at some other event in the near future. 

The problem is, I get really nervous around guys I’m interested in! Sometimes it even makes me ignore them (I haven’t dated much before). I don’t want this to happen again. 

I just wanna talk to him and get to know him better, and let him get to know me. What are some good questions to ask, or topics to talk about? How do I avoid being too nervous and seeming closed-off? 

I’m generally pretty good at making small talk and being relaxed around people I’m not attracted to.

Drinking was a heavy theme on all of our dates. Quick rundown, first date we went to a brewery, had a few pints and then went to a dive bar where she proceeded to order two 24 oz beers with a shot of vodka in each, followed by sharing a couple bottles of wine back at her place. Second date, she invited me out to join her and her friend at a restaurant - when I got there, she was more intoxicated than she had been at any point on our first date. Spilled wine on me within a minute of joining. I quickly learned (or should have learned) that going out with her on a Saturday night when she’d had all day to drink wasn’t the best idea. Third date we went out on a work night, a bit tamer with her just having four margs at dinner.

Fast forwarded to what would have been date number four. Silly me I made plans with her on a Saturday, though we were initially supposed to have lunch so a bit safer than our second date on a Saturday night. She texts me when she gets to the restaurant, I’d just finished working out and needed to shower quick before meeting her. By the time I was out of the shower, her plans had changed and she was now going to a friend’s party that “she had just had sprung on her.” We left off that she was to give me a ring later once she was free. 

Fast forward to 7pm and this is the first I’m hearing from her since around 1:30pm. She calls to apologize for blowing me off, still at the party she got to around 2 with no end in sight. We leave off that again, she’ll call me when she’s free.

I hear from her again at 9pm that she’s leaving the party and would love to come over to my place. I text her my address and start getting ready. She was about 15 minutes away, so should be over around 9:20. 9:30 rolls around and she’s still not here so I give her a call. No answer. Shoot her a text to make sure she’s okay. Call again at 9:45pm and this time she answers.

“Hey what’s up?”
“Where are you, is everything okay?”
“I’m just about home, what are you doing?”
“What do you mean you’re just about home…?”

The party she was at was only a 5 minute drive from her house… even more concerning. She seems confused and doesn’t really say anything.

“You said you were coming over and asked me to send you my address… I assumed you would have been over 30 minutes ago and have been worried you either got in an accident or got pulled over”

“I’m just pulling into my driveway now”

“Did you forget you were coming over…?”

“I don’t know what to say”

“I’m just trying to understand… You called me and asked to come over and for me to send you my address. And then rather than just plug in my address, you somehow forgot and went home?”

“I don’t know what to say”

It went back and forth like this for another minute or so until I just had to hang up. It was clear that she was heavily intoxicated, had gotten so drunk that she’d forgotten she even called me and was supposed to be coming over, to the point where she made a 5 minute drive home take 45 minutes.

Needless to say there won’t be a fourth date, and I am genuinely concerned for this person’s well being as well as the safety of all the drivers whose paths she crosses. She commented on our first date that she had been in five accidents, at least one of which had been pretty heavily under the influence. Am I obligated to do something here?

There's this one family friend we have. I guess she's fine, I never really thought much about her appearance or personality, fine but not particularly amazing or interesting to me, let's call it neutral, same with her career and pretty much everything. Every conversation seems to be this completely crazy story. Most recently, she was dating a doctor, who she described as funny, smart, and even good looking... 
 
And then she broke up with him because she wanted to wear high heels everywhere, he's her height and no shorter. 

I was just like...What...Look, I fully acknowledge that I have to be attracted to who I'm dating, but there's never been a time where someone was 90% great and then I broke up with them for a single physical metric outside their control.  
 
I could have brushed that off as one odd person, but it's always been similar. Breaking up with a guy because his laugh was bad. Just two inches too short. His shoulders were barely wider than mine.  
 
I'd say this will all come around to them when they're alone searching for someone perfect, but this world doesn't work like that at all, and through the fault of my own gender someone will always bend over backwards as a replacement for them. And then this same group will make it out like only guys are vain.  
 
It's all kind of depressing to hear as a probably very average guy. For me, I'll go out with people who I'm even neutral on attractiveness wise and sometimes it's worked out because of a personality match or other factors that are plusses. But it makes me think, those dates that later ghosted or said they had a good time but just wanted to be friends, was it really that I was dismissed for some tiny physical metric that was off, two inches too short, didn't like how I laughed, proportions off?

I think a huge part of growing as an individual is to analyze your mistakes and figure out ways to fix said mistakes, but something in my last relationship still bugs me.  


A little backstory - my ex had an abusive relationship before me, and she opened up to me about that fairly quickly (even before we got together). I listened to her and assured her, that I'd never do something like that. I'm generally a very chill person that never resorts to aggression in any way (not verbal, nor physical). I'd say I generally treated her nicely - I've bought her gifts (nothing big, just small gestures, like getting her favourite desert on casual days, bringing some of the food I cook for myself when I know she'll be busy studying, etc).  


As we started dating we would make plans together initially, and we would both be excited about said plans. One thing, that I noticed even early on, is that she would only make plans for the evening of the day we make plans on (for example, I'd ask ""when will we meet next"" and she'd respond with ""I'll let you know whether I'm available tomorrow during the day"" for the same night. She was very busy with her studies, so I never really cared about that, but thought I'd drop this in here as well). If she let me know, that she'll be busy that evening, I'd usually make plans with my friends and spend time with them, so I don't really see myself as a clingy person. She would sometimes go out with her friends as well, and I was always happy for her, that she is spending time with other people as well.  


Since it's her last year in university, she starts thinking about whether it's a good idea to remain in the current city or to move cities (finding a job in her field is usually very difficult, she is studying to become a doctor, and there aren't too many hospitals where we live). I would ask her what her plan was after she graduates, and she would always speak with an ""I"", instead of a ""we"" statement. She'd say ""I'm thinking of perhaps moving to the city my family lives in"". Now, I know this usually shouldn't bother me too much, but it kind of did. I've let her know from the very start of our relationship, that I'm looking for something serious and long-term, and that I don't date casually. She was okay with that. I also work from home (remote job), so I can move pretty easily, and I've told her, that I'd be willing to move cities alongside her if things in our relationship went well. Yet again - she never spoke about ""us"" as a unit.  


One night I decided to confront her about that, when she said ""I'm probably going to move cities after I'm done studying"". I told her, that it bothers me, that she never includes me in any of these plans, and she said ""I just don't like to think about the future, it scares me"". I didn't really know what to say, but I let her know, that it really bothers me, and that I don't think it's fair on me. After that night, she started withdrawing from the relationship and it got to a point, where she was feeling ""depressed"", and could no longer remain with me. I'm pretty much over the breakup at this point (4 months later), but it just left me wondering - did I do anything wrong there? I knew about her abusive ex, and that it'll take more for such a person to open up, but when I said to her ""Listen, I know your ex has treated you badly, and I'd never do something like that, and with time you'll see that yourself"", she responded with ""I've done inner work and I'm already over that. It's in the past, and I've changed a lot since then"", so I dropped my guard a bit, and started treating her, as if she hasn't had such an experience, and treated her how I'd treat any partner I've had. Obviously I had expectations, but aren't those a part of being in a relationship?  


I guess I must've pushed harder than I needed to, since I've mentioned to her, that once we move cities, I'm hoping we'll get to live together (we were already 3 months into our relationship and the ""move"" wasn't happening for another year, so that should be a pretty reasonable time for two people in a relationship to move in together, right?). I just don't know whether I was being too pushy in this situation, or whether she was too traumatized to be in a relationship. If you have any questions, I'll be sure to answer them as well, since this really bothers me, and I don't want this situation to repeat itself in any of my future relationships.

We just broke up recently bc he couldn't meet my needs. I was seeing him every 2-6 weeks and he lives 30 min away. I wanted to see him 2x per month. He has a lot on his plate rn and we both have kids. So it was difficult to see eachother. 

Also sometimes he wouldn't text me for 2 days while he traveled and id get irritated bc he wouldn't let me know he's okay. I only wanted 1 text per day checking in and letting me know he's okay, he's been stranded before. He is very sweet and empathetic, so I don't think anything shady was going on. 

I came up with solutions to make it work, but he decided its best to end it. He said doesn't see his life becoming less crazy until after the holidays. He said that my needs are very reasonable, yet he is still having trouble meeting them. And that im not clingy at all, and that most women are much more demanding. I asked if he would have regrets and he said he probably would. He said he didn't want to end it, but I deserve to get my needs met.

He asked if we could be friends and at first i said no, then he cried. He said he still wants me in his life in a way. I changed my mind the next day. I don't usually stay friends with exes, but our relationship is the healthiest ive had, outside of my needs not being met. And hes an awesome person. So I made an exception.

We then decided to be fwb for now. He already knows how to please me and I need sex. I let him know that I started talking to other people. He said he just doesnt want to hear details.

At a small social gathering in an undisclosed location somewhere in the US. A broad range of topics were considered and talked on by in no way shape or form experts. One of these topics stuck out in my mind. But unfortunately, I am no researcher. So I went to the one place I knew had a bunch of people who know a thing about a thing or two. 
For todays special, the topic is on mystery in a relationship. To the tune of “women like a man who is mysterious” and that it was a key for a healthy relationship sort of came out to be a general consensus. 
There were 2 notable objections, including my own. Their objection was that they didn’t like to play guessing games. 
I, however, just felt like that is a little dishonest. I was under the impression that in a healthy interdependent relationship, why shouldn’t you have no secrets or mysteries? Not in a “I need to know everything about my partner or it’s a failure” but rather something along the lines of like “I am spending the rest of my life with this person as we try and accomplish our goals. Along that journey surely there will be time to talk and learn everything. Wherein from that perspective I can see the pros to always making it feel like theres always something more but is that alone a reason to keep walking on the journey? Because to me like, isn’t knowing everything essentially just a door to another journey?“ But. Again. Me no scientist. Me also single. So take some salt to taste here. 
Which brings me to where I need your help. If in the event my gut reaction is wrong and that mystery is more important than I give it credit. Or, in the event it is not a mutually exclusive situation. What are some innocent ways to be mysterious? What, is, mystery? How many grams of mystery do I need for the recipe of love?

My boyfriend and I have been dating for 7 months. He is an amazing human, very respectful, honest and Godly man.  He has never been in a relationship before and I am his first girlfriend. He has been on dates before but nothing serious as he didn't find the women he went on dates with ""girlfriend"" worthy or what he was looking for.

I talked about my past relationships (Which was 2 long term) and his experiences on dates. I saw a few of the women he dated in his past. They are just beautiful. When I mean beautiful I mean jaw dropping gorgeous.  Walking into the room that's the first thing your eye will catch.

I am not saying I am not beautiful, but I just see myself as not beautiful enough, or I can reach at that certain standards.

my boyfriend has always called me beautiful even before these insecurities even started. He has done nothing to make me worry or that I am not enough. All he ever has done is made me feel loved. He is loyal and honest.

I am at a point where I keep comparing myself to the women he went on dates with. They all had something common. Blonde hair, colored eyes, beautiful features, and knows how to do flawless makeup. They were mostly white women. Compared to myself, dark brown hair, dark colored eyes, average features and does casual makeup and I am Asian. Before dating me, he wrote a list of what he wanted in a wife. And on that list had blonde hair and blue/green eyes. I know things can change when you start to date someone. But that just sticks to me.

Now my boyfriend is a really handsome man. (White guy)  Where he gets hits on both women and men. He models for a few things and is in the beauty industry. I think to myself, if he dated these women, he would look so much better with them. But he chose me out of all of them. And I know looks doesn't always matter but personality does. But of course I want to be attractive to my boyfriend. which I am so he says.

I did speak about my feelings to him. He reassures me that I am as beautiful and he doesn't want to date them. But chose me. That he waited so long to find someone to really start a date. So he can start to date towards marriage. that's why he never had a gf, never had his first kiss ( we still haven't kissed on the lips), still a virgin  (Both religious so waiting for marriage). Because he wanted to wait for that someone special to spend it with. But insecurities is getting in the way of me seeing that..

So I am just looking for some advice how I can overcome this.

I hadn’t really considered it before but not a single girl has never been interested in me. I’ve had tons of crushes and girls I’ve wanted to date, but no one has ever felt that way about me.

This is leading me to consider a lot. Mostly whether or not love is for everyone. I know everyone says that, “beauty is in the eye of the beholder” and “every pot has its lid” but is this stuff really true.

Like if it was I’d think there’d someone already who has like me but maybe I wasn’t a perfect match for. But no, nothing.

We go to the same school, but we met at our job at a fast food restaurant. He and I get along really well at work. He's a very friendly guy, but very much a nerd. When we first started talking, I would always be the one initiating the conversation. It would only be questions such as weekend plans and stuff. However, I felt like I was doing that too much, so one day, I stopped initiating. I still said good morning to him, and talked to him when I needed to, about work-related stuff, but I didn't go out of my way to talk to him about things outside of work. The next day, however, he walked right up to me and asked me about my weekend plans. It's been that way ever since. Sometimes, when I come in, he'll stand next to me and not say anything, so I'll initiate. 

Sometimes, he'll help me out at work, even when it's inconvenient for him to do so. For example, one time, on a day where it wasn't busy, and therefore less employees, I was helping a customer at the register, and he was nearby restocking items. I made a mistake and forgot to give them their change back, and I was unable to reopen the register. There is a code to open the register, so I was going to go to the back and ask another more experienced employee for help. Before I could leave, he asked me what happened. I explained to him, and he tried opening the register. He wasn't able to reopen it, but he tried. There are several more examples I can give when he helped me. 

Two weeks ago, he asked me about my weekend plans. I told him, and I asked him what he was doing.  He told me that he was going to visit his friend at work. He then said ""I'm not going to say no to bothering someone at work, I already bother you enough. Or maybe I should bother you more?"" I didn't realize he was flirting at the time, but I know now. 

With all of these signs, I was pretty sure that he liked me. I'm having a party this upcoming weekend, so I invited him. He responded saying that he's not sure yet, but he'll let me know in a few days. However, I saw a few hours later on his twitter (which I don't follow) that disloyal people irritate him. In a separate tweet, he said that he has a headache thinking about the situation and that messing with someone's feelings is bad.

I don't have many friends and the few that I do have, I don't get to see them very often. This last girl I was seeing, we had like almost 20 dates. Everything was going great until 2 weeks ago. She started getting cold around me, we started kissing less and less, we barely talked via text anymore. Before that we used to text everyday (not necessarily all day long, both me and her worked during the day and we had our own personal time as well). She told me she noticed she was being distant, but that it was just a bad week, and nothing to do with me. After a while she just texted me she wanted really hard for us to work as a couple, that I am special to her... but that she just wasn't feeling the relationship flowing anymore. I felt really sad ofc, but I kept it cool and I respect her decision and lack of romantic feelings towards me.

I've met this great girl and I brought her to a friend's party where we danced a bit and had a great time. After a week she invited me to a party and I met a lot of her friends who all were wonderful. People started shipping us. But the thing I am struggling with is that she did not start a conversation with me at that party, but afterwards invited me for a sleepover. A week after that I went to a karaoke bar with her and again had a wonderful time. Sometimes she sends me the occasional post on Instagram, but then the conversation is kinda dull. We have so much in common and I really like this girl. She almost always shows interest in the things I'm doing, by replying to anything I post.

I’m 30 years old, mixed black male, 5’8 in height and I’d best describe myself as witty, personable and outgoing. 

Currently I’m passionate about fitness and amateur modeling, but outside of that I just enjoy being spontaneous and trying new things. I enjoy hiking/camping, rock climbing, kayaking, running, yoga, cooking and nights out dancing or grabbing drinks.

This post is inspired because most of the activities I engage in (D&amp;D, art association, board game club, video game club, etc) and even my major (CS) make me even more of a minority in my potential dating pool. Semi-recently, at board game club, a group of men playing a game (that I was not playing), made a disparaging remark about the black woman on the cover of one of the board games, and then continued to laugh and mock black women in general. Someone else told them to knock it off, but as the only black \*person\* there, not just black woman, I was extremely uncomfortable and it ruined my night. 

It's made me start looking more in depth at certain gamer subreddits, D&amp;D/gaming spaces, and CS forums (admittedly, terrible places), where I can't help but notice that no matter what, black women are always put into these memes as unattractive, undesirable, ghetto, and just overall seen as the lowest of all women. I'm not saying that all people with these interests explicitly think this way, but it definitely feels that most people in these circles have an unconscious preference against black women, which makes me feel like there's no hope in dating anymore. It's made me question if the amount of matches I get, the quality of the people I match with, the amount of people I don't match with, the people I meet in person and don't connect with, how many of those people did not go for me because of my race? 

Even in OLD, black women are not only no race's preference, but Asian, White, Latino, and Black men are least likely to select black women at all, and Asian and White men are more likely to select against seeing black women at all in apps where that is an options.

Knowing all this, it makes me feel incredibly hopeless, that no matter what I do my race will be the determining factor in whether or not someone even gives me a chance. I have gone on two dates, and both of them decided to share with me that they have ""a thing"" for black women. Is that all I am going to be able to date? People who see me as basically \*only\* my race? It feels like that's what I'm going to have to settle for. I have no clue how to work past this barrier, any advice?

We started hanging out and she said right away on our first Netflix and chill “date” that she just wanted to be friends and isn’t in a mental state to give anything more. I said that’s fine as that’s all I really needed anyways and I could always use more female friends.

Well we end up hanging out a couple times a week and enjoying each others company. She would let me sleep in her guest bed after we would stay up watching Netflix and drinking/smoking. She would randomly say stuff like “my friends are wondering who this good looking guy I’m hanging out with is and I just say we’re friends” or “you are such a nice guy it’s crazy”

Then a few days before she moves (we are travel nurses so we move every few months) we are hanging out at a beer garden and she says “I feel like I’ve grown so close to you, I would have been depressed if you didn’t move here.” She then starts looking at flights to the next city I’m moving to and told me to come visit her after Christmas before I move. We also were at improv comedy and got singled out and the comedian asked if we were dating and she said “yes”

The last night she asked me if I’m an emotional guy and she thinks she attracts emotional men. I keep quiet and change the subject. When I get home she says goodnight and I say sweet dreams, she replies “I hope they’re wet dreams”. Well I took the bait and she rejected me saying she values our friendship too much to ruin it with sex and that she’s sorry she sometimes gets drunk and suggestive and is working on not doing that through therapy. She gets mad that I start replying with one word answers and calls me. I say I’m sorry but she can’t be saying suggestive stuff like that and that I find her attractive and it’s been a while for me too. She said well she already made it clear she only wanted to be friends in the beginning and she just got out of a fucked up 6 year relationship and needs to be guarded and have clear lines in relationships.



The next day she leaves and I’m a crying wreck. I call her and tell her I’m depressed. I don’t confess my feelings. Just that I’m depressed. She said she’s here for me if I need her and gave me advice because she deals with depression and sees a therapist once a week.

I do feel depressed and not sure if this rejection is bringing it out or if it’s all it is. I want to be friends at least because she is awesome and good female friends are hard to come by. But it’s hard to separate my feelings right now when she is still texting me and checking up on my well being. 

Should I tell her my true feelings and tell her I need space? Or just keep doing what I’m doing and keep it short with her but friendly? I feel like both options have their pros and cons",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1124838,public,self,I’m in love with my close friend,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qpm57e/im_in_love_with_my_close_friend/,no_ads,0,,,
