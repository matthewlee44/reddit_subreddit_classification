Basically I've (27F) only ever had sex with one person who I was in a 9 year long relationship with. Needless to say, I am no longer in that relationship and trying my hand at dating. I've never dated as an adult, but all I ever hear about are hookups and sleeping on like the second date and shit. I don't want that. Sex is special to me, and while I don't take THAT long to ""warm up to the idea of it/get that special connection"" (was with my ex for about 1.5 months before I lost my virginity to him), I still don't want to rush into things/I want to take things at my pace. I also have anxiety about it because I'm afraid of having a ""wham bam thank you ma'am"" moment and getting ghosted as soon as it's done. Basically, I think I don't want to have sex with someone I'm not officially in a relationship with. 

How do I communicate this without scaring off potential partners? I also don't want to be ""tricked"" into thinking I'm in a relationship or something only for them to pump and dump. 

I get that I'm probably over thinking things, but I'm honestly really afraid of this and it's affecting me in a really negative way. I was in a position where I never thought it would be an issue and now suddenly I'm having to figure this all out waaayyy later than a lot of other people. I don't even know if this is a healthy attitude about sex or not or if I have some sort of weird hang up or what. Societal standards have me feeling ill. 

Just for a little extra information, I'm about to go on my third date with a guy and things are going really well, but he's also been a little extra flirty lately. I do love the attention and his flirting gives me butterflies, but we haven't even kissed yet and the thought of rushing into sex when we haven't even kissed/made anything official makes me uncomfortable. I've told him I don't know what pace I want to move at and he seems to be respectful of that, especially since he even asked before giving me a hug (also said something about how he's fine with just going with whatever happens, happens), but I'm still afraid he will lose interest.

So I've noticed I have no clue how to make my intentions clear to girls I talk to. I either come off too strong or hide my intentions and they get scooped up by someone else. It might be good to know that I have asperger and aren't the best at reading people. I've never had a problem making friends. I have several friends, including girls, but as soon as I want to pursue a romantic relationship with someone they either reject me (usually with a ""let's be friends"") or I'm too vague and they meet someone else.

I'm kind of lost at the moment as someone I was talking to for a bit just told me she went on a date. I exercise twice a week, I'm pretty tall (2m or 6,5 feet) and not that bad looking I feel. I know girls aren't quick to ask you out, and no one owes me anything, but I haven't really been on an actual date and I do feel a bit frustrated.

I told him to please send me a copy of the id via text, and that it was fine to block out any info about his address.

I really like a guy that lives a couple of doors down, I first met him around 7 months ago and first noticed his dog, I was an overweight drunken mess at the time and just come out of a 10 year toxic relationship.

I moved into a new place and was sitting on the front step and out of nowhere this stunning dog came over to me and I started stroking him, then his owner came up and I told him that I wanted to keep his dog, I think he got freaked out and got funny then walked off.

I kept seeing this dog and didn‚Äôt even notice his owner.
One day after a week long bender on drink and drugs I made the decision to stop drinking and in my mind created a dream in my head that one day I was going to get my own place and adopt a dog, an old dog like him and I would spoil him rotten in his last years..

I promise I‚Äôm not crazy or obsessed but that boy touched my heart and stayed in my mind.
Over the months I got better and better and ended up dropping from a size 18 to a size 14 and got my looks back, I found my style and discovered my Art.
I am now a different person.
I love myself for the first time in my 39 years of life.

My ex came back and I ended up dumping him after a traumatic event, I got a court order and made sure he will never come back to me again..
Unless he wants to serve some time. 
I grieved and wrote and wrote and wrote..
I kept thinking about my dog and the thought kept me strong and sober.
I didn‚Äôt go out for weeks and weeks until court was finished and I had the order..
When I was granted the order and felt safer, I started sitting out on the front step again..
That‚Äôs when I noticed him, he was tall dark and had the most Seraphic eyes, he was gorgeous!
I‚Äôd never noticed him before and I got crazy butterflies, he was very shy but we got to a stage where he would greet me and then hurry off with his boy.

The other day his dog came straight up to me and I stroked him, the guy looked touched and said aaaah.. Then he rushed off, I decided that I had to ask him out.

Yesterday I was sitting on my front step again after an afternoon nap and he walked by and this time I said ‚Äúexcuse me but would you like to go for a drink one day(non Alcoholic for me though, I hate Alcohol now), he looked stunned and said yes he would but that he had to go as he was late to meet his Brother..
Then ran away!?

I‚Äôve been outside today but he must be still running because I‚Äôve not seen him.
I feel like such an idiot and must have looked so desperate!

I think I might move because I don‚Äôt feel like I can face him again.
I used all the courage I could find to ask him and he ran away! 
Wtf is wrong with me?!

What do I do please because I don‚Äôt want my heart broken again and this has knocked me for six.

Should I just get 100 cats and become a hermit?

This will be a longer post but I need advice 

Basically my ex and I were together for 7 months and she was my first love so that might be important idk but I really thought I was gonna marry this girl which might sound crazy cause we were only together for 7 months but I was absolutely head over heels for this girl.

So my ex and I had a decent relationship for the most part but constant arguments about small little things were such a problem. Before I say the rest tho I should say by no means was I perfect, I did mess up and I did try my hardest to fix my mess ups.

Some of the situations were like I told her I wouldn't be happy if she posted a bikini pic on Instagram just because my moral beliefs just don't agree with them and she thought it was controlling and toxic to not be happy if she posted one. She would also say stuff about being sad because she sees other dudes post pics of there girlfriend in a bikini and let me know she's sad cause she knows id never do that, I always felt so bad but looking back it seems kinda wrong she compared me to other boyfriends she would see on TikTok and stuff. I feel like if we could've just talked it out and been mature we couldve respected each other's opinions and continued on instead of her just calling me toxic which shut down conversations about it.

We also had broken up one time and 3 days later she was considering getting back together with me. I told her who I was with the day before which was 2 of my guy friends and one of there girlfriends and the others friend that's a girl, I'm in no way freinds with either of them and my ex knew that. She was so secretive about not telling me who she was with because ""it seems to normal and things aren't back to normal"" so I told her if we were getting back together id need to know who she was with cause if she was inviting dudes out 2 days after breaking up then the next day tried to get back with me then I wouldn't be cool with that cause I wouldn't want to get played. She then said it was the most toxic thing I ever said and we were never getting back together. I asked why it was toxic and she said ""you should know"" and then she blocked me. Fast-forward a couple days and we talked about it and she said it was toxic of me cause I was hanging out with 2 girls the day before but I told her context was important on who the girls were cause she knows I wasn't friends with them at all and they were there because of my dude friends. If she would've mentioned this concern instead of calling me toxic and shutting down a conversation I feel like we could've figured it out pretty easily. 

One time I saw her Snapchatting this one dude she hadn't talked to before and wasn't freinds with. I knew he wasn't a great person and has done bad stuff so I said ""I wouldn't snap him"" and said I didn't really like her snapping him, she then said ""good thing it's my snap and not yours"", I wouldn't have told her not to if they were friends or anything but I knew they weren't which is why I said it. I feel like this was an unnecessary situation cause my friend who has a good healthy nice relationship once said this to his girlfriend and she said ""sure babe, I won't snap him anymore"". 

After breaking up I asked Tons of people if I was toxic and they all said no. I then talking to my ex about it and found out one of the stories I told about her was a miscommunication, I remember her saying it's not wrong for her to snap dudes selfies where her top is out in a bikini, she remembered her saying it's not wrong if she shows her straps of her top. She said obviously it's wrong if she sent dudes snaps with her top all on the picture, and I agree with her that it's not wrong at all of her to send dudes snaps with her straps of her top in it, it was pure miscommunication. We then stopped talking again and today we started talking and I wanted to talk to her about our relationship and all the things she called toxic, alot of people thought weren't toxic and she would just say ""obviously people don't think you are, you lied in your story"". Obviously I remembered a situation wrong and I told everyone I remembered it wrong and apologized but she just kept saying I lied in my stories, and wouldn't talk to me again.

I try and date well educated or successful and attractive women that are in their 30‚Äôs. I‚Äôm picky but I‚Äôm not unrealistic, I do well with dating apps and I‚Äôm not negative or dissatisfied with online dating in general(OLD).

Over the past 6 months I‚Äôve been on several dates and started exclusively dating 3 women, obviously not at the same time. I‚Äôve always been clear and concise that I‚Äôm looking for a serious relationship and that I‚Äôm interested in marriage and a family but not to rush into it. My approach has always been to vibe with people and make it feel natural but still be a gentleman and romantic.

3 times now, I‚Äôve met incredible women, attractive, successful, great communication, we‚Äôve seemed to hit it off, multiple dates, good sex etc‚Ä¶ but, all of these women have ended it. One said, she needed to focus on herself, another said: she wasn‚Äôt ready. The last said, she was too busy with her career and asked if I wanted to be FWB. She was shocked when I told her I wasn‚Äôt interested.

My theory is that people always think they‚Äôre ready for relationships until it‚Äôs there in front of them. When it‚Äôs time to commit to something real, people back out, be it because of fear, convince or just disinterest. I don‚Äôt know that there‚Äôs a way to filter people because I genuinely think that, they think they want a serious relationship, they just don‚Äôt know what it takes?

These experiences have made me second guess myself, makes me feel like there‚Äôs something wrong with me or my approach, it‚Äôs made me more reserved and made me less interested in committing.

I am still out there dating, swiping and trying, I chuckle a little when I see posts from women saying ‚Äúall guys want is sex‚Äù because I wonder if when a relationship is open to them if they‚Äôd take it or if they‚Äôd back out at the moment of truth like the 3 previous women I‚Äôve dated.

When I was roughly 19 years old I took my lack of a love life as a big wake up call to improve myself. The first thing I focused on was making something out of myself. The idea is that if girls are not noticing/interested in me, then I have to become worthy of their attention, so I started studying to become and currently am a Medical/Laboratory Engineer. During these 5 years I worked on different things such as my hygiene, my wardrobe, fitness etc.. Things I had been greatly lacking during my teenage years. Hardest part was learning to socialize properly with people, even with strangers on the go. I am good friends with people from all walks off life and even some YouTube ""celebrities"" keep me in high regard as a valued friend. My dog was also a big help socializing with girls, and he helped me land the second date of my life (Mans best friend indeed).

This summer, I was hoping that I would finally be good enough to peak the interest of girls. I asked girls for their numbers, snapchats or just if they want to meet up sometime and nothing ever led to a date. I don't think I have high standards either, the only physical standard I have is chubby girls (more than 30-35% fat ratio. Even with a gun to my head I wouldn't be able to be attracted) Other than that, I dont care about physical appearance.

I'm out of ideas now on how I can improve on myself or what I am doing wrong. I'm hoping any feedback here can give me new ideas or things on what more I can do.

I try to convince my group to spend the night at my house to watch football game and drink, she was also into it while everyone doesn't because they live far away (including her)...but she doesn't like football.

I don't know if I should try asking her out seriously again. She is quite chatty and we also have a lot of mutual friends so it'd embarrassing if she turned me down. Also she supposedly broke up with her long distance boyfriend very recently but I don't know how serious it actually is. We are hangout in the same group of friends but we're not close at all, we don't text or anything.

Even if it was an unusual relationship and in the eyes of some not a real relationship, it was my first one, i'm 21.

In 21 years only 1 girl asked me out (I said no cause she was extremely annoying) and with my ex we kinda confessed our feelings at the same time.
I've asked a few girls out, got rejected ofc but didn't really know what I was doing.
My social life isn't the best at the moment I have to be honest, but even when I try to really socialize it seems like no one is interested.
I've received a wide variety of compliment from many people, men and women.
I above average looking, I know how to dress, I have a nice voice, know how to hold a conversation with anyone, I have many interests, been told I was charming, i'm fit (I workout 5 to 6 times a week), I have nice hands...
The only things that can be a bit of a turnoff with me are my height (5'7/170cm) and I kinda have a babyface (I'd say I look more 18 than 21).

I also should add that i'm not looking for hookups or anything, only a commited relationship, hookups/one night stands and such things make me feel really numb. I tried some dating apps but that's really not my thing, i'm also probably shadowbanned on Tinder or something because I deactivated my account too many times.
I don't know what I can do honestly, I know I'm still young and some people might have it 10 times worse than me but so many of my friends are in relationships and I just feel like there's something wrong with me at this point.

TMI: He gave oral a few times, but he's never wanted it back, in fact he kept his pants on every time we were in his bed after I mentioned I had a few bad experiences, and that I don't sleep with people unless I really trust them. So he really just focuses on me everytime.

A few days ago, for the first time he held my hand when we were walking on the streets, put his arm around my shoulder and held me close when we were standing outside. We text everyday, sending memes and both of us don't care about sending a lot of texts. 

We meet at least twice a week, sometimes 3-- depending on our schedule. I would like to see him more, but he doesn't try to ask to see me more, so I haven't told him that yet. 

I don't know where to go from here. I just don't want to get hurt. I have the onset of catching feels, and on one hand, I feel like maybe I should just tell him I've started to like him, and if he rejects me, to just stop the feelings when it's still very early and move on.

i 18F have had SUCH a hard time finding a relationship. i know what your probably thinking, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre only 18, there are plenty of fish in the sea.‚Äù but i‚Äôm just getting so tired of it.

i‚Äôve never been in a relationship, or even had anyone actually like me. no one has ever said it or even mentioned a date unless it was for sex. it‚Äôs really starting to break my heart. i‚Äôm getting tired of building myself up again and again.

i‚Äôm not sure where the deep rooted insecurities come from. i definitely don‚Äôt have the best relationship with my parents but that should pose a problem in romantic relationships right? after so many years of doubting myself, i can proudly say that i love me. i hype myself up every day in the mirror and actually believe it now. i think i‚Äôm pretty. i‚Äôm also very charismatic. i can make anyone laugh. i‚Äôm in college now and plan to be a veterinarian. so far, i‚Äôve been incredibly successful in my school and previous jobs. now i help doctors at a nearby animal hospital and i‚Äôm learning so much. every time i get ghosted or what not, i pick up another shift and focus on helping the animals. i also found my passion at a very young age. lots of my 18 year old friends have no idea what they want to do meanwhile i have a long resume of animal care. im extremely great full  to have already found my passion- and i‚Äôm very serious about it. do y‚Äôall think that scares people away? 

i‚Äôm afraid one thing that has constantly posed a problem is that no one looks further past my body. i‚Äôm lucky enough to fit the basic Pac-Sun beauty standard and have a little more booty than most. that‚Äôs all anyone sees. i‚Äôve talked to guys from the club, tinder, high school, in my regular college classes, and from my vet classes and it‚Äôs all the same thing. they get to know me for a little, then ghosted again. it‚Äôs really starting to get to me. 

what hurts the most is no one views me as a number 1. every single time there was someone better. i don‚Äôt like sneaky links. i just don‚Äôt want to have sex with someone who doesn‚Äôt care ab me. it‚Äôs not my thing. however these same guys don‚Äôt have the decency to snap me before 10pm but they bend over backwards for other girls. i‚Äôm honestly very jealous of those girls. 

i‚Äôve wondered if there something incredibly wrong with me. like statistically shouldn‚Äôt someone like me? i feel like i‚Äôve looked everywhere. i keep getting ghosted. it‚Äôs been about a year since i even tried to put myself out there. since i‚Äôve changed a little i thought i‚Äôd give it a shot. however it‚Äôs the exact same thing. getting ghosted. honestly i‚Äôve probably tried with 10 different guys this year and not one has been actually interested in me. i respond in a pretty timely manner, i stick to plans, i engage in conversation and i send full face snaps. i don‚Äôt know how to keep anyone interested in me. i‚Äôm talkative, the convos are never boring. i‚Äôm just seriously at my wits end here. 

this time of year gets me especially sad. halloween is my favorite holiday and all i‚Äôve ever wanted was to enjoy it with someone.

I forgot about dating or trying to have sex because I had to assume the roll of adult bc sister and dad were always drunk, combat my grief and my preixisting mental health issues, planning the whole funeral myself, people kissing my ass that I don't know, managing finances, signing papers until my hand was sore, suing the hospital for wrongful death, getting sued by estranged family for my moms portion of her inheritance, being paranoid that I would get arrested for the time I paid a stripper to bang me while high on some drug, and sleepwalking, so finding love was not my concern. 

I really want someone to love, but the issue is that too cynical since I can retire today and have enough money to live until I'm 300.

Wisdom I learned from the past year and a half:

\-At your darkest rockbottom day where suicide isn't a bad idea, DON'T DO IT. YOU WILL GET BETTER. 

\-Buy a casket on Amazon, its multiple times cheaper for literally the same exact casket. 

\-Don't let other people disrupt your inner peace

I have hobbies and take good care of my physical fitness. Ive been in 3 relationships in my life, all were long term. None of them ended badly even, no toxicity. Nothings really strongly impacted my thoughts on dating in a negative way until recently.

Time has gone by and Ive been single for a good 5 years.  Focusing on my career and bettering myself. 

Ive been on a few dates recently and each time the guy has become forceful with me. Borderline sexual assault...one actually did assault me. I met 1 through a dating app and just assumed it was my bad for not reading him properly. I was upset for a while but got back out there. The other 3 were actually through friends or work. I assumed because we had mutual friends, they were ""safe"" to a certain extent. I was wrong. All 4 experiences were traumatic. We meet up, we speak for a while and share a few laughs. Normal date stuff. Then things escalate super quickly and I'm not feeling it. I say I'm not comfortable with what theyre doing and they keep trying throughout the date until i ultimately decide to leave.

 Thing is, im not a flirty person really unless i am comfortable with someone. Theres no way im giving them any kind of signal to pull this shit as i am often nervous as fuck going to the date at all.

The one that was the most upsetting was a guy that i actually set boundaries with before meeting up with. I explained to him that i am celibate now and looking for something long term. He agreed and said he respected that. Then that date went the worst out of them all. Tried to force himself on me and grab me mid conversation. It ended with me yelling at him and leaving. Weird thing is he texts me later that night and asked for a second date. I feel like Im fucking losing my mind, lol.

I feel heartbroken honestly. I get really excited that we're hitting it off and love the energy. I want things to work out, i want to love these men. Then its spoiled and it hurts. I feel unsafe.  I have so much love to give and i want to share my life with someone. 

Is there some kind of vibe I'm giving off now that attracts  these types of men? Is it something I'm doing? Not saying anybody deserves this btw. Im just noticing a bit of a pattern and I'm genuinely curious. I even texted one of the guys and asked what the fuck was going through his mind to think that what he did was okay and he told me it was because I'm sO bEaUtiFul...are you fucking kidding me?

Sorry. 
Background: My Fianc√© (M) and I (F) have been in an LDR for over 3 years now &amp; got engaged last year. We plan for me to move halfway across the world to his country next May/June (2022) ish to get married, if everything goes according to plan. 

Recently we got into a major argument because I found out he was planning to go on a trip to an amusement park around the same time I would be moving there, AND he decided to exclude me from it. His reasoning being that I don‚Äôt really like the crazy/dangerous looking rides (especially rollercoasters or anything else that goes upside down etc) and that I wouldn‚Äôt enjoy it, and I would also ruin the experience for him since I would be screaming the entire ride etc.. 

I love amusement parks, like Disney or universal studios, I just am not a fan of the big crazy rides. I have however gone on them before just because my family or friends wanted to. So it‚Äôs not like I completely hate amusement parks or would avoid them. I love the regular rides and the rest of the amusement park experience. Plus, for me the most important thing would have been to enjoy spending time with him regardless of where we were or what we were doing. 

While this might seem trivial, I‚Äôm very upset because of the following reasons 
- he excluded me from the entire decision making process as a whole and decided to exclude me and made a choice for me. 
- I‚Äôm moving halfway across the world to be with him while he wants to go on an amusement park trip and leave me behind around that same time. I thought we‚Äôd be doing things together to make up for all the lost time in a LDR
- he barely gets actively involved in any of the planning, like the move/the wedding/our future plans etc.. but he‚Äôs making the effort to plan some random trip to an amusement park. I feel like he doesn‚Äôt have his priorities straight as he should be helping me plan our future, and the amusement park plans can wait. 
- moving to another country plus the visa fees, flight tickets etc are going to be very expensive and I have been doing my best to save up for these. He has been claiming to be broke as he met with some unexpected financial trouble recently so I think a trip to an amusement park is the last thing he should be planning right now.

    *Preface* So I‚Äôve been working at a store and I would usually stop by a sandwich shop for my lunch. I met a girl there who I thought was pretty and my type so I did some flirting but I didn‚Äôt feel like things hit off. I decided to just have fun and talk with her regardless. I always make her laugh really hard and she acts more of her ‚Äútrue‚Äù self around me ( she doesn‚Äôt use the fake customer service attitude etc.) and often doesn‚Äôt charge me for anything/everything I buy. I would probably consider her my friend, We have each others number but We don‚Äôt text just talk/ flirt in person about once or twice a week. I never really thought she would or did like me.

Her: Ditzy, pretty, very kind, intelligent( compared to me.) probably a objective 7-8/10. She gets ALOT of male attention, many guys hitting on her complimenting her etc. 

Reasons why I could see she likes me:

She has brought her mom to my work (Deli)
she was doing some shopping with her and she was all dolled up and kept asking how she looked. I did the usual class clown and made them both laugh and entertained. Her mom and her left and I heard her mother say faintly ‚ÄúI like him‚Äù 

Constantly gives me free stuff and tells me to come visit her at work. 

Her boss ( I‚Äôm chummy with him also, older gent real nice guy) always gives me her days on and tells me to visit her. (Weird but dunno)

Three months into our work friendship and we are talking about her upcoming outfit for her dance ( no outsiders allowed to it) . She claims its ‚Äúsuper hot‚Äù and she is excited she gets to dress up. Usually when I meet her she is in her work outfit. She says I  should come see it, ( we have never met outside of work) but I had work so she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come to you then you work sat?‚Äù 

*The event* I was just cleaning the deli with my boss and then I see out of my eye her and two friends, all three dressed very pretty. Her friends were prob ‚Äúprettier‚Äù but her dress was the best. They come up to me and we all chat for a bit ( I was kinda breathless so I probably seemed like a idiot to them, I regret acting so bashful) but regardless, my boss comes over and she says ‚Äú are you sure she doesn‚Äôt have a crush on you? Who the hell drives out of their way to show some guy she knows her fancy dress.‚Äù I said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù and then my boss calls me clueless. Took a poll with my friends and they all said she does also

Sorry for bad formatting and long winded my first reddit post tbh. I just want a outsiders POV feel free to ask any questions if you need more info.

TLDR: talk to girl for three month, super friendly with her, she gives me free crap and wants me to visit her, she came to my work out of her way to show me her outfit for a dance.

I'm pretty average looking and super shy, and in group conversations I don't usually contribute much, and rather listen to what's being said. I often fade into the background and go unnoticed, which in the past was preferable due to having loads of social anxiety. Now that I'm older, I'm having a really hard time with dating and relationships. 

In the past, I've been in two relationships. Both were online and pretty toxic in their own ways. I've had my fair share of short flings, but once again everything has happened online. My online persona is much more confident and charming in comparison to how I act in person. I don't have the same nervousness that I do when interacting with people in real life.

I'm seeking advice because I want to know how I can make myself stand out more. I haven't had my first kiss yet, and I feel left out because many of my friends are in super happy and loving relationships. I'm fine with online/long distance relationships, but the most important thing is finding someone who can appreciate me for who I am. I'm a nerd who likes to watch anime and geek out over music and writing stories. I don't want to change myself and yet I want to increase my confidence despite this.

The first month, the mom and I started exchanging texts, starting to exchange personal things with each other, eventually borderline sexting, seeing each other every now and then. She was so adamant about seeing me some days, showing care for me and such. We finally went on a date and when we got back to her place, we hooked up. A few days after I noticed she was slowly starting drift away. She would occasionally like my posts on FB and make a comment every now and then. When I would text her the next two months, i was most initiating things, she would keep it small talk and occasionally flirt with me, but when I tried to see her again, there was a reason. 

Finally I had a talk with her. I asked her why she had been so distant. She said that with her divorce and work, she wanted to focus on herself, not looking to get into dating or relationship, just want to have fun. So i just backed off a bit, I told her how I felt about her and we could just go slow and play things out, she didn't turn down the idea. So for the last several weeks, I gave her some space. 

Yesterday, at my friends get together, she shows up with a dude driving her and she gives him a couple kisses before she walked in. I caught it all and not going to lie, I was hurt/salty about it because IMO what I saw kind of felt like she just did me wrong because I didn't feel like she gave a indication that it was a one and done type of thing. So I just couldn't help but ignore her while she was around, we said a few words to each other and i just couldn't make eye contact with her. I know I probably could have handled the situation a little better, but I'm not of the smash and dash mindset, and she feels the same way in a sense. She had told me in the past that sex is more than just a fun act and we move on, like she wants to have that connection with someone before she does it. So shes leaving, she says to me ""do i get a hug?"" I said ""yea sure"", but I couldn't put much into it, and she was on her way. 

I told her today that after what happened yesterday and just seeing what's been happening of late, she just doesn't have those feelings for me clearly, and I even mentioned as a friend, I said I hope we can talk but honestly I don't expect that we will now and wish her best of luck. She never respond.

I am the loyal type, not a smash and dash. I feel used. Is this how dating is now? Like a Black Widow, ""have sex with your partner and basically cut their head off after your done?"" Did I just run into a situation where I was just the rebound guy and that she just needed me to get some until the next guy? I literally couldn't sleep last night thinking that I never changed being the person from one day to the next with her and she had a change of heart. I personally feel like damaged goods now, my one friend says don't take his personal, we weren't dating....and I get it, but if this how dating is, putting time and effort into it, getting personal, and then once the sex is done, your just another notch on the belt?

I (30F)  have met this guy (25M) around 4 months ago and we are getting to know each other. 
We live in the same city but he is originally from a city that's 3 hours away by driving.
He told me he was transfered here because of work and almost one year ago he broke up with his ex and she came back to the city they are from because there is where her parents are.
The thing is they have a 3 years old daughter, and the girls lives with her mother.
So this guy drives every weekend to this city and stays there for a day and a half with his daughter.
He's always talking about his daughter and he shows how much he loves her. He videochats with her every night and seems like a present father. He shows himself very sad about being away from his daughter and tells me the girl gets very sad when he leaves too. 
The thing is... His boss told him he gonna be transfered back to the city where his daughter lives. They didn't give him a choice, it was an order and he's currently there. But he is fighting back legally because he says he doesn't wants to live there, that they can't make him and that he wants to live in my city because he likes it better than his city.
My problem with this is I'm wondering if he really wants to be a present father like he says, because he is always telling me how much he misses his daughter and how much she wants to be with him, but when he gets the chance to come back to his city he doesn't wants to, and not for a legit reason.
I know you still have the right to do what you wanna do when you become a parent, but I'm starting to think his daughter is not his priority and this is making me respect him less.
Because now he is all the time with his daughter, but he is deciding to come back here and only see her for one day and a half every weekend. Also, he told me he is waiting to his daughter to turn 6 years old and decide to live with him. I also think this is so selfish, to make a little girl decide between her mother and father just because he have decided to live in a different city.

My last relationship didn't end well, and I've missed a lot of opportunities, but I still want to feel that way about someone again. Maybe this time it'll end well, maybe they won't hurt me, or maybe it won't be too late.

Still, I don't know how to find that ""someone"". Dating apps are out of the question for me, and I live in a very homophobic country so my dating pool irl is already so small (I am part of the LGBTQ community). Plus, my ex was my classmate, and we only dated because we were together almost everyday, so I doubt we would have been a thing if we didn't or we were in a long distance relationship.

And speaking of, I've had crushes on people who lived on different continents, but that didn't end well either. There is someone I had a mini-crush on as well, but they just told me today that they planned confessing to their irl crush. I didn't really care, to be honest, I'm actually glad there's someone close to them who can make them happy.

Sometimes, when I look back on all my negative experiences with dating and attempts-at-dating, I start thinking that maybe I am the problem. I'm simply not likeable enough, or I don't do enough for my person of interest to like me back. This thought is also part of what's keeping me find that ""someone"".

I have six guys that I consider exes. I view all six as wastes of time for different reasons:

1. I was teaching English abroad and he almost trapped me in a country and job that I hated.

2. Cheated and left after a year. No explanation given. Took and never gave.

3. Cheated and dumped me on Valentine's Day. We worked at the same place and ignored me when I even said hello. Waste of time.

4. Cheated on me in a beach house with his friends Memorial Day weekend (I was there). Waste of time.

5. Was with for three years. Implied when we met he was looking for marriage. Somewhere along the line decided he liked what we had and never wanted marriage, just a committed serious relationship. Three years down the drain.

6. Used me and took advantage of my kindness. Took me out on my birthday and dumped me by lying about not wanting to come out because his parents would disown him. Was actually seeing someone else for two months before he dumped me. Waste of time.

I view failed relationships as a waste of time, because I don't think I actually learned anything from these folks. What I did learn is that I hate dating and think most people try to use relationships to fix their own messed up personal lifes. I don't think I actually learned anything from any of these though.

My theory is-

1. Makes the person feel like it's not a copy+paste message
2. There's some instinctual reaction to someone who says your name

In-person- Definitely made a date feel more comfortable on both sides, obviously don't keep saying their name like a weirdo, but saying it once or twice during the date after initial meet-up is good practice and etiquette.

Ex. ""So tell me X, how would friends describe you?""

1. It makes the date event more personable
2. Something about people acting nicer once they know you'll recognize them by name (even more if they forgot yours)

The little things help, you can imagine the opposite reaction someone would give if they realized you don't remember their name.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1058325,public,self,Remembering and addressing someone by their name goes a long way,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q5lmx9/remembering_and_addressing_someone_by_their_name/,all_ads,6,,,,,
