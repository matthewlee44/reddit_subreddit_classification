0,oc06hh,1625190252,I found someone I really like but I feel so conflicted,"I (24M) am very confused with my feelings for this girl (24F) that I have been dating for a couple weeks.

She has a great personality and I immediately started becoming infatuated with her. However, I'm feeling a ton of anxiety about us and it feels so soon for that.

She has bipolar disorder and has been going through a rough time in her life. I think it is a bad time for her to seek a relationship but she is alone and has almost no emotional support system so I sympathize with her.

Every other day she sends texts saying that she is feeling depressed, alone, wants to self-harm, or even wants to die. I have depression and I can understand where she is coming from but sometimes it feels like she only wants me around to make her feel better. Sometimes she'll randomly text me ""I don't think I should be alone right now"" and asks me to come over. I love seeing her, but I don't want to just be there as a coping mechanism.

On top of this, she was recently seeing a guy casually who provided her with some financial assistance and she is still talking to him. I know she is dead broke right now, but they were having sex and the fact she is still talking to him makes me uneasy. She also told me about spontaneous sexual interactions she has had with other men and it makes me worry she would cheat on me. She asked me if I would be comfortable with her having a sugar daddy if we were serious and I said no way. My ex asked me that too. Why do people think that is okay in a serious relationship?

I like her a lot but my anxiety is eating at me. I'm scared to talk about my own problems because she has plently of problems of her own. I have no idea what to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oc06hh/i_found_someone_i_really_like_but_i_feel_so/

9,oc0oaj,1625192094,What. Is. Wrong. With. Me.,"I met a man tonight on a night out (in my area, covid restrictions are low) and was hoping just for a nice vibe, someone to chat with even just for ten or fifteen minutes. But I refuse to kiss him in front of a group of strangers, while it was light outside and we were both sober, and I get told I'm prude and ignored for the rest of the night.

It seems so obvious to me that this guy was in the wrong here, but it has happened so often that I can't help but feel: is there something wrong with me? 

In fact, I pride myself in recognising red flags in people, as I am well trained and versed in this field of psychology, and I don't understand where I'm going wrong. 

I don't expect that every or even any man I meet on a night out will be The One. I couldn't care less if they never spoke to me again the next morning. But is it really too much to ask that, just as I do not force such expectations on the man in question, the same respect isn't given to me?

I would say this is all just because I meet many guys on nights out, they are often intoxicated or just stupid college guys (I'm in college too, don't worry), but it's happened with every guy I've ever met with and it hurts. I'm fed up of it. And the strange part is, I love to be single. But - as I say - just because I don't want a relationship doesn't mean I don't feel hurt when somebody I've been chatting to quite innocently the whole night turns and tries to take me then and there in front of half the cohort. 

I hate to generalise, so I will add that I'm sure this isn't ""all guys"". But it's all the guys I've ever been with, so maybe you can understand where I connected the dots. How do I stop these interactions from taking place, as it is so hard to see the difference between red flags, green flags and orange flags these days.

16,oc1kd1,1625195441,How to get over a guy I was not in a relationship with?,"Background Info 

There is this guy I have been talking to for a bit now. I am F24 and he is M29. I have known him for years but we were both always in other relationships. Recently we both reconnected to find out that we were both single. We started texting a lot and became a bit closer and then met to hang out in person. In the beginning, I was not overly interested but I grew to like him more. We ended up having quite a bit in common and I felt quite comfortable with him. At this point, I wasn't overly attached to the idea of him. As well as, there were some things (traits) about him that I couldn't see myself actually going into a relationship with him for. More time passed and I was going through exams at school so I was a bit distant as I was studying. He would message me often and would tell me how he missed me and wanted to see me. I explained to him I was really busy with my studies but after my exams, I would love to get together and I apologized for my absence. This is the point where I began to like him quite a bit more. We hung out again and had a great time we stayed out until the early morning and I had so much fun. About a week after this he began to text a lot less and he would respond slower and slower. I am very straight up so I asked him if everything was okay. He mentioned he was going through a lot at the moment and having a rough go. I let it go at that point. However, now we barely talk and he will watch my stories and now and then won't reply to my messages. As well as he will post stories out with his friends but then not reply. I like to think I am not naive so he is either very suddenly lost interest which how sudden it was makes it strange for me, he is actually going through something or he is playing games. The only reason I think he could be playing games (referencing back to the reasons I don't think I could date him) is because of things and ways he would act with his ex gfs. As in deliberately doing things to play mind games with them. So I wonder if he is trying to get back at me for being busy those few weeks and going MIA with studies. 

So you would think that knowing this I would be glad he isn't messaging me but I feel so hung up on him and bothered that he isn't messaging me anymore. I am not a person that plays games with people so I feel irritated and confused. 

Question :

My question is:

1. how can I get over him (tips/advice/experience) because he is consuming my mind 

2. should I text him and ask him to be straight with me or does that seem like I'm being too much because we aren't dating?

(28m) - midwest town of 500k.
Thought you guys would enjoy my attempts at dating. So I matched with this girl a couple months ago on bumble. She started asking me if I knew these random people. Like, sorry girl, no. Turns out she has an interview with my company. Anyways, we seem to hit it off. Then one day that week, I forgot something in my car. Walking into the building, who did I see? Ms bumble of course. We had masks and I didn’t realize it so it was a wave and hello. We laughed about it over bumble. I got the number shortly after and the texting went well. So after a week I asked I asked her out to the local zoo, it’s pretty cool. Then I got ghosted. 2 months later, I’m sitting in a company meeting and guess who walks in, lol. Btw, it’s a 10 story office building with a couple thousand employees so not that small.

I was going on dates with this girl. She asked me to join on a jog. Sounded fun so sure! Anyways, I got to the park and couldn’t find her and her description of where she was at didn’t make sense. Turns out I went the park across town and had to call her and drive the 20 minutes there.

Same girl I went running with, asked me to get a Swedish massage. I’d never got one before and wasn’t sure what she meant. I also felt weird about getting naked in front of strangers and her for the 1st time. My friends all are made at me because I didn’t go and they wanted me to get a handy because they are all married and want to live vicariously through me.

Another girl I met online, we really hit it off and had chatted on the phone quite a bit before meeting in person. We went out and enjoyed it and then went back to her place to watch a movie. Thing is, I get really nervous about relationships so then my stomach gets all topsy turvey. I also hadn’t kissed a girl before so I was extra nervous. Turns out I had to blow up her bathroom quite badly and I also had some gas issues. She was in med school so we laughed and she gave me some pretty strong stuff for my stomach.

It's always seen as a harassment and bother, so I have no one I can geek out over with since they are all like *""oh man you should had told him to fuck off or do something weird so he would leave you alone.""*

I was walking today and I was about to turn a corner and some dude stopped me and I had headphones in be he was all like oh I love your whole look and vibe. Which was funny because it was simple yoga pants and cut crop top, like literally not impressive at all. But I got fun hair and tattoos so I guess the combo is cool, active wear but alternative. And he was being so nice and being like wow you mannerisms are really cute. And the whole experience just made me super happy and giddy. I usually get flirted on at bars and in the club and get cat calls but this was the first time someone stopped me and wanted to talk, so I wasn't really sure what to do. I eventually walked away and i'm like damn we should have exchanged insta's or something.

Also very interesting to note when flirting happens. Like I wore my hair the same way, same makeup, same yoga pants and shoes but the difference was my top. I kinda gained some weight but luckily bless with always having a small waist so I wore a big cute sweatshirt the other day, and nothing. But today I wore a long sleeve crop top that shows my waist and shape and bam thats when I get all the comments on the street and stuff (which I don't mind event he raunchy stuff). But yeah again lots of girls despise men for hitting on them which in turn has caused men to do it less in fear of it getting called harassment but I've been feeling down on myself because I gained like 6 pounds but to get someone to come up to you just made me so happy the rest of the day.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oc2gg3/i_feel_like_im_the_only_girl_my_age_who_likes/

I got her number last week, we exchanged a few small messages about out weekend then organised a date for 4 days later. We didn’t text until the night before the date, where I messaged her to confirm we were still on. 

The date happened last night. The conversation and banter was amazing, so after drinks I suggested we get some food - she agreed. We got dinner, continued the joking and chatting. We then went for a walk, held hands, and when it came time to depart, I said I had a fun time and would love to see her again. She said she would like that too. I asked what she was doing on the weekend, and she repeated what she said earlier in the night when we discussed what our weekend plans were - but she said she could do Sunday night. I said Sunday night would work for me, and I’d text her to organise. She was super giggly and awkward and an opportunity for a kiss was there, but we just went in for a hug instead. I then said to text me when she gets home, and we parted ways.

I didn’t hear from her for a while, so I messaged her to say I had fun, and to check if she got home okay. She responded with a ‘same here! and yep I got home all safe’. 

I didn’t reply, and its now late afternoon the next day. I’m thinking of messaging her:

“Hows your Friday coming along?

p.s. I’ve got an idea up my sleeve for Sunday night that could be a bit of fun - lets tee it up if that works for you?”

I think based on the fact that we had a good first date and discussion of a second, this should be fine to send? If the date was okay and we just parted ways then I would be more conscious, but there was interest! I’m also a bit nervous because we’ve used texting solely for logistics (except to talk about our weekend in the initial texts).

35,oc3dt5,1625202752,Pining after someone I can’t have,"Kind of a long story time so bear with me: 

My entire senior year of college (2019-2020), I (22f) was in love with this guy (22m). I quickly found out he had a girlfriend. That didn’t make my feelings for him go away but I kept a bit of a distance and respected that. We became closer friends and I kinda felt like he would flirt with me sometimes but I was probably reading into it and he was just being friendly. Then in March of 2020 our college sent a group of students to participate in a week-long competition across the state and he and I ended up spending a lot of time together on that trip (his girlfriend didn’t go). The last night of the competition one girl invited him and me and another girl to her hotel room to drink and watch a movie and it was fun. When it ended everyone else was asleep in their hotel rooms and the rest of the group that watched the movie went to go sleep too. Except for him and me. He said he wasn’t tired at all and I said me neither so he suggested we just walk around the hotel. We were both tipsy and I still had a full drink in my hand. Anyway we walked around the empty hotel and ended up sharing the drink and getting kind of drunk (this was pre-Covid btw) and we just talked and it was really nice. I was still in the mindset of “I know I can’t be with this guy but at least we can be friends.” But then he invited me to come hang out in his hotel room and I, being drunk and lacking my usual inhibitions, said sure. I had forgotten my key to my own hotel room so I asked my friend to get it for me and they ended up hanging out with us and me and the guy never went to his hotel room after all. I was annoyed at the time but I think my friend saved me from making a big mistake. I don’t know if the guy was into me and would cheat on his girlfriend but I’m glad I didn’t make myself a home wrecker. But the thing is I replayed that night over and over in my head and wondered what would’ve happened if my friend hadn’t joined us. 

I tried to get over him. I got a boyfriend that summer and although I really liked him I still secretly had feelings for the first guy. 

I haven’t seen him in a year and I’ll think I’m over him completely but the truth is I’m not. I still have feelings for him, they just go dormant for a while.

He always tells me he appreciates my efforts, and asks me / makes sure I am fine with it. Which I am, I love to drive. However lately, I have gotten in a bad situation with my parents and going to long drives would only cause problems between us.

We haven't seen each other for around 2 weeks, so I suggested he meets me halfway by going through public transportation. He says he will try, but I just feel like he is dismissing the idea.

We usually go out then I go to his place and we have sex. This is making me think that since sex is not on the table if we were to meet half way could this be why he is not interested to see me?

I have to mention that he is a very nice guy, he texts me all the time and is interested in what I have to say. When we hangout it's not just sexual.

When I’m there everything seems great between her and her mom they get along and joke about things and just seems like there’s not a problem between them but she keeps telling me she is crazy and this and that and I don’t know if I should believe it. But she’s got all this going on and I want to help her and I’ve been trying to help her and I’m kind of limited to my ability to help because I don’t have a license right now and she’s been letting me use her truck to pick her up and do stuff with her because my truck is broken but her mom doesn’t trust her truck to make it to her dads and won’t let me drive her car and I know I can’t borrow my dads or moms car so that’s out of the question. But i did make sure she got to spend Father’s Day with her dad, I even went with. But I have problems remembering stuff and have anxiety, depression, and add and I have told her this and tried to make it clear to her how they effect me and she seems to get it but doesn’t change how she does things and keeps doing the same stuff that I tell her bothers me.

51,oc5f6c,1625212256,I don't know what to expect by this Post :/,"Hey Reddit ;),

i guess i need to tell you some details about me. Me (31m) never rly dated but i had one girlfriend for 1/2 year when i was 25y old. I never rly looked for dates because my mind gets occupied by things and persons im interested in and it always jumps to those topics. Im honest and a very rational person (studying a MINT Topic) and feelings are so danm irrational. Normaly im very soaciable and i able to talk to alot of ppl because im interested in alot of topics but i suck at flirting.

After 1.5 years of pandamic i had enough from my everyday life. I was gaming alot and kinda irresponsible. So right now i trying to get rid of my bad habbits (i.e smoking,  procrastination, alot of gaming) and i started dating earlier this year.

Due to the pandemic i decided to choose bumble (it got recommended to me by a friend). It went okeyish i had a few dates. I didnt expected much because i tryed tinder in the past but i wasnt convinced by those apps. But then it happend. I matched with a women and it went great. We facetimed for \~10h and wrote each other everyday. So i kinda fell for her before we even met.

Our first date went kinda horrible. I cant recollect alot but the liquor got to me and my selfdoubts got the better of me. The main thing i can remember was her disgusted face due my selfdoubts and how unattractiv i became and her comments on my jeans (out of date) and t-shirt (was my fav shirt which i wore in two of my profil piccs).

Honestly i didnt mind the comments about my outfit because there was some kinda truth to it. But the facial exprassion kinda boggled me. Writing became hard after the date. She withdrew herself completly and the answers were short and there was no effort on her side to keep up the conversation eventhough she agreed to meet up again but told me the wasnt interested in a relationship in general with anyone at that time.

I got some advise from a friend who is pretty succesfull in the area dating and he recommended that i should stop writing her after she admited that she would meet up again.

Its been a month now with no texting or anything. But my mind sucks and im catching myself thinking about her daily and im wondring if i should write her. But it seems kinda pointless because somehow i dont expect a diffrent outcome.

I guess i want your opinion about it. Somehow i have the feeling i just should get over it but somehow i kinda rly liked her. Maybe its just in my mind, dunno rly.

And i have a last question. Why are women (not all of course but those i met) interested in if i think im intelligent or handsome? Why do i need to compare myself with other ppl and whats the standard of this comperison? Some famous Scientist or Superstars?

I'm a trans guy, queer, POC have quite a few mental issues that therapy hasn't been able to help so far, physical health issues, lived through an abusive childhood so I have no positive family experience or any examples of healthy relationships in my life, and I'm short and wide due to genetics (losing weight won't change it much) so in general there's really nothing attractive about me beauty standards wise. 

Personality wise I do get along with most, and people do tend to view me as reliable or a good person but that never goes in a helpful way as it usually just leads to me being pushed into the useful friend role. Any time I've had a chance of a relationship with someone it would be stopped by them being uncomfortable around my circumstances or by me being trans making it a deal breaker for them.

Even though I'm a minor in highschool and I have more time to try things I can't help but wonder if I should just give up now. I know a relationship isn't everything, but to me I just know I have so much love to give and I feel so empty/lonely with no ""one"" in my life. I try to distract myself by always being productive in other ways and spending time with friends but I can't stop having this query in mind. I don't think my expectations for dating are overly high. I really just want to be in a relationship where I could trust someone.

My question is if dating just isn't meant for certain people to ever experience. People have made it very clear I'm unwanted in multiple ways for the reasons I listed earlier and I want to know if those reasons make it completely impossible for me to find someone I'm compatible with or if there's even a chance that I should hold out hope for.

Now I'm lean and I have a good personality. And since I'm moving to college in a month, I would seemingly be able to date or hookup with all the people there that are 18-25. Along with all the people in the city the college is in. But I have 3 dorm mates. We each have our own bedrooms in the dorm though. Would having 3 other dorm-mates make it hard to have sex in there? Or would having my own bedroom make it still pretty easy to do it?

59,oc6blq,1625216841,I don't feel like I'm ready for love even when I'm in a relationship,"I love the boyfriend I have. But it's because of the toxic relationships I've had in the past that I feel unsure. Like I'm testing him more then I should. And I found myself feeling more unhappy picking at his flaws when I know it stems more from discomfort from myself. 

Recently I found myself wishing more for friendship then for a relationship. I have told him this as well but whenever he tries to get close or talk about me in front of his friends I just feel put off. A tad bit when he flirts in front of a crowd. I asked him to treat me like a friend as I need some distance but he treats me the same. I don't dispose him for it cause I know the fault lies with me having such weird feelings cause im double guessing myself and I don't know why. 

Other then me being afraid that if I fall into a relationship deeply im going to get trapped into a toxic relationship again. After I got out of one so quickly. Where the guy was over my shoulder everyday and that I wasn't able to spend time with my friends. But now I'm feeling like I need a step back because I never got that time to breath.

The chemistry is there for sure but other than that it would be nice to talk to him face-to-face to see his reactions and body language. But with only texting I have a hard time building a trust between us. He’s out of the country at the moment and will be traveling a lot during summer so texting is our only choice since he didn’t ask for my number. Maybe if I’m lucky we can meet up once or twice during summer. I’ve brought it up to him and expressed my discomfort or dislike of using all the texting as the only form of communication between us and he said that he understands but it’s the only way we can communicate until we can meet in person. The problem is I feel like I keep losing interest because of it and he is not the best Texter either so the conversation is pretty boring, although in person he was really totally different and fun. I have a hard time texting people back, even my friends and i can feel my initial interest in him fading away quickly... also he always texts me “what’s up/what are you doing” which seems like low effort to me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oc75jw/tired_of_texting/

I am not afraid of speaking to them nor do I have anything against them. 

The problem arises after the first introduction. 

I am currently in my third year of university and I notice a trend of many females that I meet ditch plans or only try to befriend me to get some help with their work or to get something out of me. 

I have called many of them out several times that if they just want to get something from me that they should be blunt and end the conversation there and don't try to waste time. To which they don't respond to. 

I also try to go out of my way and message them to meet or make some conversation but they do not tend to do the same after messaging them a few times. I have to constantly start the conversation but I am also afraid that I am being too aggressive with my approach and being seen as someone desperate. 

I personally am not trying to get a date or relationship, just some friends and the female perspective of life. 

I think that I have held my values and dignity intact but I also feel that I am very disposable and not seen as anyone cool to hang out with.

78,oc8qqd,1625227734,Dating could be so simple - We need to give ourselves more chances and create more opportunities,"I am a 21 year old male who has found myself dating after losing my near 5 year relationship just over 3 months ago. I had never experienced the world of online dating until recently and I can only find negatives to it currently. We are living in a society where the internet and technology is beginning to rule our lives more than ever. I acknowledge that the OLD scene helps some people and has its success stories however, I believe there is so much potential for people to truly meet the people they long to have in their lives.  


I am not engineered like a lot of lads I know who are my age. I put this down to my upbringing, job and just general personality. A lot of lads I know are only interested in 'playing the game' or look for casual and one night events. I don't want to mislead people. I won't be connected to multiple people as I find it disrespectful to play with their emotions for my own gain.  
   
Everyone on this subreddit has the same goal... to find the 'one' for them. We are all different people and have different goals/interests etc. There are 7.6 billion people on this planet and there are many people who are looking for the same things we are. They may not be on reddit, they may not on OLD, they may be on the opposite side of the planet BUT, they are out there.   


My biggest issue with OLD is that it doesn't really give people a chance. Having signed up to multiple apps there are common themes. Every single app stops you from making a proper connection by requiring currency to see people who 'like' you or limit the number of users you can engage with. Every single app has a bunch of individuals who are using the app for 'a laugh' or for 'fun'. Every app has people who use it to boost their ego. I know we could never eradicate these problems. I know that they are present and will be due to the world we live in. My wish is that the people genuinely wanting a relationship will actually seek one instead of being reluctant. If you match with someone, please talk to them. If you think someone looks interesting, give them a chance. Best case scenario is you find your person, worst case is that you move on and find someone else.   


The worst problem is that WE don't give people a chance. As much as we can blame the apps, other people and the ongoing circumstances in life, we limit ourselves heavily. The apps are mainly focused on how a person appears on image and most users won't even look through someone's account. That means that if someone doesn't appear 10/10 instantly they get rejected. There is more to people than just the way they look. Personality is more important than looks to me. When selecting your interests you state what sort of thing you're looking for in a match. If you find a user with a few similar interests? MATCH THEM. They could be your future partner or they could be a great friend who opens new doors for meeting new people or having new experiences!  


I have spent the last few months improving myself further. I have passed my exams. I am progressing in a very good career. I have been socialising. I have started new hobbies. I have got even fitter by maintaining my gym plan and doing boxing. Exercise has been my way of dealing with the aftermath and I could honestly say I don't think I'd be typing this without it.   
I can't say I'm 100% happy as I do feel lonely or lost sometimes. I do feel an empty space in my chest that I want to fill. I do want someone there to talk to, to spend time with. I may not find that anytime soon but I want to keep searching. I have recently been told by someone they are worried about dating me due to previous relationships. Don't let your past hold you back. I am genuine. I want nothing more than to experience love again.  


The main message from this is that there is so much more opportunity for everyone. If we gave people a chance instead of judging them instantly we could have so many more people in happy relationships. If you do one thing today, search for the love you want. It's extremely rare that it'll just find you. Create the opportunities you want.

Now that we are almost 2 months into the relationship she has found out her mom who she lives with is moving to the next town over, she just had surgery on her foot and she really wants to spend the holidays with her dad because she hates spending them with her mom. I made sure that she got to spend Father’s Day with her that lives 3 hours away but am not able to make sure she can spend the 4th of July with her dad so I bought a bunch of fireworks and told her let’s just make the best of it together but she’s been really emotional about it and just this whole month I can see it in her face that she’s just not the same person and everytime I ask her about it she just says nothings wrong and shuts me down but I know there is and she just won’t tell me.

83,oc9hgy,1625230427,Getting ghosted after she (presumably?) developed feelings. I think no one will ever know...,"Hi everyone, I've actually read many threads on this subreddit on different topics during the past few weeks and saw many different points of view that expanded my visions about dating. So, I felt like making this post to ask for some advice because I'm really confused (and also need to vent a bit)

I'm 23 M, who met a girl on Tinder (23 F). She started texting first and almost 10 minutes in, we started talking about nerdy stuff and anime in a really friendly way. She is a really good looking girl but what I felt was as if I had found a close friend that I didn't see in a long time, but in a way I've never experienced with anyone (I've never had a ""best"" friend)

So 5 days go by with a non-stop talk, because we had a lot to share and we both don't have many friends to talk to. Suddenly, she starts talking about her boyfriend (I didn't know she had a boyfriend, but she said they took a pause from their relationship) saying she doesn't want to go back with him because he's not good at sex, and then listed all his flaws. Then, she proceeds to talk with me about sex, what I like and stuff like that. I mean, we met on Tinder, I saw it coming, but knowing she shares with strangers personal detailed info about his boyfriend was a big red flag for me. And that killed all my interest in dating her as a potential romantic partner, however the fact that she shares with me unique interests that I cannot share with any of my friends made me think about keeping her as a friend (I told her about that, she agreed)

Saturday, we decided to meet up at my place (I picked her up with my car) and less than one hour before the actual meet up she started talking about fantasies of me kidnapping her, which I took naively as a joke (long story short, it was not a joke). We came home while talking non-stop as we did via chat (and she was visibly nervous). Suddenly, she says ""you're not really my type"" (which was a blessing from heaven, since I had no intentions to commit to anything romantic with her) and continued hanging out as if nothing happened. Then, she starts talking about the fact that she masturbates a lot to fantasies of being kidnapped and that she always dominates guys when having sex (which she regularly has) because she said they're not muscular enough (while I hit the gym regularly and I would say I'm pretty ""big"". In practice she doesn't have a complete intercourse with them because she doesn't allow anyone to have her other than her boyfriend). I've always been dominant and violent during sex expecially when in front of me I have a submissive person but I always try to hold myself from being ""too much"". So I said to her:""what did you expect from me?"". She responded by saying that she was having a good time with me because it were years that she didn't have an ideal date like this during which she could be so open with a person and that every time she hangs out with people she needs to drink alchol in order to be comfortable, but with me there wasn't this necessity because she was feeling comfortable being alone with me. Clearly she didn't respond to my question so I said:""look, speak clearly because I hate wasting my time"". Again, she didn't want to provide me an answer. After some time, however, she started physically teasing me and that led to making the thing I've metioned before sparkle in my mind and I lost it completely. So we had sex, the most amazing sex of my life (for real, like 3 hours went by) and soon after we finished she started crying saying that her boyfriend is not this good but that she also want to make love with him and wants his babies. However, while I brought her home, she still said we need to meet up again. But knowing how she reacted I said to her that first she needs to talk with her boyfriend and until then, we could not have more than a friendship (which she AGAIN accepted, saying I'm so sweet that I care about her)

Almost two days later, I've sent a message saying if she was feeling ok or wanted to talk about what she didn't say to me that night (hoping via text she would have felt more comfortable). However, she ghosted me. And it is almost 6 days. The strangest thing is that (for example) when I post stories on ig, she's the first to watch them (like 5 minutes after I post, at any hour of the day, she watches them as if she was constantly stalking my profile. She hasn't unfollowed me) 

I'm really confused about what she is experiencing and if I should let her be or try to talk about it because I feel she didn't tell me the whole story and I feel that throwing away everything because of a misunderstanding is really sad. I want her to be at least my friend (because I haven't felt this kind of connection with anyone and she's a really cool person) but if she wants to have something serious she needs to take her responsibilities and talk. However, I feel as if I fcked everything up.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oc9hgy/getting_ghosted_after_she_presumably_developed/

I (M24) met a girl (21) at Tinder about 2 weeks ago. We quickly jumped to Instagram to keep on chatting. The conversation went smoothly and last week (Saturday) we went for dinner. Things went good, apparently. Once we got out of the bar we were in. We walked for a couple of blocks to her car. On our way there, we hugged and kissed for a bit. When we arrived at her car she offered to give me a lift home, so I agreed. Before she even turned the engine on, we started kissing again. Things escalated quickly. We were making out intensely(she was on top of me). Although she expressly said ""no"" to sex because it was late and she was a bit shy to do it there, she gave me oral. We must have been in her car for like 2 hours. We asked each other to let know when they got home. I did, and so did she.

This is where it gets weird. On Sunday, we didn't chat; she had ""liked"" my sleep-fine-kind-of messages, remember this was on Instagram. So I didn't push it. I talked to her again on Monday. It seemed to go fine, but I really wanted to take the chat over to What'sApp. She gave me her number and warned me she kinda took forever to reply... I said it was okay, since the conversation had gone very smoothly up to that point. However, once we started talking on WPP, I noticed she started taking a lot of time to reply. She would reply on Instagram within a 20-40 minute window or in hours if she was busy. Here, she takes mostly an hour or more. I don't expect her to message me every after 20 seconds, but it feels off somehow.

I was going to ask her out again sometime next week. She has exams next week, so I know she must be busy. I'm totally okay with that, but I feel she is not into me, and I don't want to have big expectations. Following the ""the sooner, the better"" mindset, I thought of asking if she's free this weekend, knowing she most probably would decline the invitation. She hasn't even replied to one of my messages sent yesterday at night yet. Thing is, should I plainly ask her if she wants to keep chatting/going out with me, to avoid any bullsh*t, or is it too straight-forward? I'd rather have her telling me she doesn't want to have anything to do with me, than me being in limbo. I'd really like to know what the heck is going on. Any piece of advice is useful.

94,ocbgd6,1625236796,Do you feel unappreciated?,"I am a 21 year old male. I have just come out of a near 5 year relationship. I would've done anything for that person. I put all my time and effort into them despite having college, 2 jobs and a life to maintain. I would commute to see them constantly. I would call them before and after work. I would do thoughtful gestures after exams and spoil them at events like their birthday. Despite all this it wasn't enough. The relationship ended unexpectedly and I was left heartbroken. They seemed to move on instantly and I questioned myself for a while. Since then I've started self improvement. I'm still the man I was but a better version. I now have all of those qualities and more. I have achieved more qualifications, progressed my career, gained new hobbies and got even fitter via greater gym time and boxing training. More exercise has really improved my mindset and I can't express how great it is. I feel confident and I'm enjoying myself a lot more recently.   
My problem is that I want someone. I dont need someone, I want someone in my life. Someone to love, support and care for. Someone who can share experiences with me. I can go travelling or shopping alone but having someone else there makes it even more special. Just someone who would like to spend evenings together and watch movies. Someone to explore with.  
I see a lot of my mates not appreciating their relationships enough. I see others who mislead women and use them before later breaking their hearts. I hate this. It isn't what I stand for.  
I have tried Online Dating and haven't had much success yet however, I am staying positive.   
My question is, do you feel unappreciated? Do you feel like you have a lot to offer to someone out there? Why does the world stop us from meeting that person?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ocbgd6/do_you_feel_unappreciated/
95,ocbgva,1625236837,Need advice please,"I've been dating a woman for 4 months now, and we agreed to be exclusive about a week ago.  Everything is going really well and I really like her.  She seems to really like me as well.  We're both in our mid 40's.

Yesterday however, one of my single male friends informed me that he matched with her on Facebook dating.  Apparently he swiped right (or whatever the term is for FB dating) a while back before he even knew about us.  Facebook dating is how we met, so she obviously did not delete her profile (like I did) and she is still actively using it because she for sure matched with him yesterday.  It was a punch in the gut, especially since my marriage of over 20 years ended when I found out my wife was having multiple affairs.  So yeah, I already have trust issues and now this...

I don't even know how to approach the subject with her.  She wants to get together this weekend, and I'm not sure how I'm going to be able to hide that something is bothering me.  I know I shouldn't hide my emotions and all that, but I'm just really uncomfortable bringing it up, or if I even should.

96,ocbig0,1625236964,To no right or wrong,"Someone I am seeing (very on and off we had one date together), said that I am selfish because I didn't want to hang out because I was sleeping. I messaged him first telling him I’m feeling better but surely not 100% and he replies, “come over”. I know I can be selfish sometimes but I felt like I was just tired from the week ( I had a cold that left me fatigued for 4 days) I was selfish I was told because I didn't want to hang out or hook up. He thinks hanging out equates to hooking up when it’s not. I found out we have different definitions for that. I felt like I just came out to see him to hook up with him because I'm feeling pressured to do something I'm not in the mood to do I am tired I was fatigued all week. I also mentioned if we progress I wanted to wear protection when I go down on him and he goes down on me because it’s been a while since we last saw each other and I don’t know if you’re seeing other people as this isn’t a exclusive relationship right now. And he was so upset I mentioned it because he felt like it was a flaw in his character that he was other three seeing other people. I don’t care if he is just use protection when I ask. It was really odd to me he wasn’t okay with using protection granted we didn’t once when I only gave him a bj before but from now on I wanted to. What’s wrong with that, please tell me?! he made it seem like there was something wrong with how I was going about things. It felt like he was trying to manipulate the situation by telling me it’s weird and odd that I wanted to use protection. He was so upset we didn’t hook up and we couldn’t just enjoy each other’s company. We just wanted different things that night and it seemed like he caught so upset he didn’t get what he wanted and he lashed out calling me selfish for not catering to his sexual needs.

97,ocbkei,1625237132,Do I have trust issues?,"I found out she went to a movie with an ex before covid and still keeps in contact through her phone. If I never look I never would have known. I’m not sure if anything else have been hidden from me. 

She would try new food place with her male friend and not tell me or ask if I wanted to join. When I ask about it later she would say she doesn’t need to explain. 

She would make plans without consulting me first so we can plan things out and buy plane ticket or whatever the plan requires together. It is like she is fine with or without me and will still follow through regardless of my opinion for everything. 

One time I decide to surprise her at work with a coffee delivery and I see that she was chatting up with a male friend during her break and it got really awkward when I was there. She looked shocked or guilty as if something wasn’t right.

Am I being controlling and insecure? Should I tolerate this? I’m normally pretty chill and avoid conflicts.
