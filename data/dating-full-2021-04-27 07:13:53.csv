She was intelligent and smart student, my mother always compared my grades with her and always scolded me :p. I liked her because she was attractive but never thought of marrying her.  and then back in 2015 she got married to someone (I'm from a country where marriages are arranged by parents mostly). after 6 months of her marriage, her husband was diagnosed with cancer. He was admitted to hospital, and she faced it all by herself because she was residing in a different country away from her home. The doctor told her that he doesn't have much time left because the cancer is spreading very fast. She took him to the hospital many times. finally she brought her here in my country and he passed away after 1.5 years of treatment.

Now here comes my story  

Just after 5 months of her husband's death, she added me on facebook and sent a message I was like WTF?(because she'd always been very reserved). I was like WHY IS SHE TEXTING ME NOW?( I asked one of my closest friends and he told me that maybe she has no other option and she sees you as a target) so anyways we chatted and after like 10-15 days she confessed her undying love for me. She expressed her feelings , and told me that she used to like me a lot but got married and now she wants me in her life. 

Whenever I texted her, she insisted on phone call, and after a phone call she was always like ""talk to me on video , open your cam and I want your attention"" , ""see my closet, look how organised my things are"", ""I always buy branded things"" ""I like expensive perfumes"", ""hey come on I know you don't say that but you love me too and as a lover you need to show your love and affection for me in front of everyone and must own me.""

I became so occupied with her demands that I couldn't decide what to do. but one thing that was keeping me in a relationship was her honesty. She was damn honest to me. I am not wrong but she has always spoken truth. Like telling me about her family, friends even the minor details of her life. She even revealed details about her family that I wasn't even interested in, like her mother's fight with her father, her family income, her father health issues. She trusted me, asked my opinions in various situations and thanked me for my support. She's given me lots of expensive gifts though her income was not too much.

I don't know why and when that happened but I fell in love with her. She asked me that if i really love her I need to confess my love for her in front everyone and propose her quickly.  Just after an year when I really made up my mind to propose her. She was like ""better do it quickly , because you are making me wait"" I told her that I am facing a little resistance from my family and she must show some patience now and things will get resolved (my mother never wanted me to marry her, due to our family differences and I did not want to hurt her feelings too) but she insisted that If I'm facing resistance I must fight for her. she was like ""If you really love me why not you show your love for me in front of everyone and give them a shut up call"".

She said that now her mother taunts her too much that she's not getting married soon and constantly pressurize her to get married and start a family. she started talking to other rich and well settled guys who showed little interest in her and she thought that they might propose her and when I confronted her about that she apologized and said it's just because of the pressure she is facing from her mother.

After 1 and half year, she told me she just wanted to get married and needed a partner and now that I am making her wait she was like ""you don't care about my feelings"" ""you're a selfish person"" , ""you have no idea what i'm going through"" ""I'm facing pressure from my family"" ""people of my age group are getting married and I am not"" ""you are not listening to me anymore""

She kept on pressurizing me, taunting me, . every other day I get texts like ""I have a new proposal and i will marry him see you later bye"".  I became so depressed , I started taking anti-depressants. and when I told her, she said she's also depressed and taking the same anti-depressants.

She started giving me ultimatums and left me with no choice but to marry her. Anyways, I was like ""okay, if you are happy with that lets get married"". just after that she became happy and decided a date for engagement and planned everything herself. She told me that she's bought clothes and other things. She was fully prepared. I don't know why but back in my mind many things were going on (I needed a break as I wanted to assure myself that everything i'm doing is not under any pressure) I wasn't very comfortable with everything.

I asked her that i'm not very comfortable and if she can give me some more time. listening to this, she started hurling abuse at me, called me names said a lot of bad things about me (which I didn't like), she said that she's decided everything now, and her family is ready and now i'm taking more time. she said I have zero decision power and now i must get out of her life. I couldn't believe what she was saying I immediately blocked her and went no contact with her. She texted me from another number that she's very sorry for what she did, she was upset and now I need to accept her apology and get ready for engagement preparations and when I didn't reply she again said a lot of bad things. I blocked that number too.

It's been 6 months of no contact. I have heard from her family that she got married someone who is good looking and rich. her social media accounts are silent. I'm just wondering , who's at fault ? and how things would go if we got married ?

She ended up breaking things off bc she said she wasnt ready for a relationship and even though we had been seeing each other for 3-4 months, she said she saw things as casual the whole time. I still think about her tbh and i did want a relationship with her and i was very attracted tp her and sad that things didnt work out. I dont understand what happened there (maybe i became too clingy or needy once i caught real feelings) but we skydived together, we would skate together, she cooked for me one time, i bought her a birthday present, somehow we would wear the same colors when we would go out, yet she just ended it in an instant. 

And cut to last week where i meet a girl at a club and we were sort of eyeing each other throughout the night, she was a friend of a friend, and somehow she ends up grinding on my dick and dancing with me. I thought it was fun and all but after my friend mentioned to me how she just wanted to dance and have fun and wasnt really interested in me like that. I don't necessarily want anything with that girl but  i felt like i was just used like a dancing pole lol, we held hands and she grinded on my dick, it's cool to touch a hot girls ass, but i felt bad that she didn't really  mean anything serious by that.

And yesterday i went out with this girl, this was basically the first time meeting her and i wasn't even trying to make a move or anything but she invited me back to her apartment and we had sex. The sex was meh but im not even sure if she wants to hangout again and she was going out of town to see her family which she had told me about before, and she said she would ""let me know"" when we could hangout again which to me means like a soft no. In this situation im sort of indifferent about the girl but i felt sort of used lol, and like she didn't even want to cuddle after and i felt like a sort of boy toy.

With the girl from yesterday we had pretty good conversations as well and talked for like 3-4 hours and she opened up to me about her mom having cancer, her disorders, not having friends, and we talked about what we want to do in the future and stuff like that. I made her laugh and we had some banter but like i think maybe the sex was off but it was my first time meeting her so i wanst even entirely comfortable tbh and i really only had sex with her bc she offered me drinks and i got drunk.

Personally from my perspective i think im decent looking enough and i give off a very carefree vibe, so i imagine these girls feel safe or comfortable just expressing there desires onto me.

I’ve been dating a guy(21) for several months now, who I met at work and basically inspired me to end things with my partner of 6 years because I was no longer happy, and I just thought this person was everything I’d ever wanted and I saw so much potential. 

Anyways, fast forward a few months, we are dating now, and things have been incredible in my eyes. We say “I love you” to each other and everything, and as far as I knew, its been pretty serious and secure.

Now if someone can please let me know if I’m just being crazy and overthinking, or if I’m justified in being upset and concerned here: 

He says weird things like “if/when we break up ....” and mentions that he doesn’t know if I’m the one and that although it’s possible, he just isn’t sure because it is a weird time in his life and he just “doesn’t really know anything for certain.” 
He says that he is happy right now with me, that he doesn’t want anybody else and just wants to live in the moment and enjoy.
I’ve always had this mindset of “when you know, you know”, and that if you truly love someone you don’t want to think about the possibility of losing them. That you just want to keep that good feeling and hold onto it forever. So when he says things like that, it makes me feel like there is somebody else out there for him that he will be absolutely sure of, and that maybe I’m just not that person.

Am I thinking too much into this? Is it normal for him to feel this way or is it a red flag? Because my self esteem has kind of just been destroyed. I thought I was the type of girl who was worth holding onto tightly. Not just a casual fling, I thought I was more special to him than that. And now I just don’t know if I’m setting myself up to get hurt or if I should just calm down and let things play out. 

Is it completely normal to fall in love with someone and still not be sure that you want to marry then one day? It just seems odd to me. Keep in mind we have only been dating for four months, but I adore him so much I would love to think about forever with him, yet he has no idea.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,739889,public,self,Boyfriend informed me that he isn’t entirely sure he seems a future with me or not.

Long post, please bear with me.

I met this girl one fine evening, coming back from the gym. She was limping and yelping in pain. I asked if she needed help and we got to talking. I dropped her near her building and said, see you around. She asked if I'd like her number, I said I'd love that.

Got to talking. 
Met her twice and we walked around the colony, talking about random things.
I asked her out on a formal date, she said yes.

Went on a date, to a cafe and then a long walk in a park where both of us used to visit as kids.

Had our first kiss there. 
Came back and we made out under her house. (She knew I hadn't made out before, or even dated anyone before, I told her this) And in between she said, are you sure you haven't done this before, and there was a sort of glint on her eyes, that I just can't forget.

Before leaving I asked if she'd want to be my girlfriend (again, never dated anyone before) Her expression changed, and she replied, idk why I'm even thinking about this but I'd like to know you better before. With that she left.

I texted her, had a great time, etc, she said the reason I can't answer your question is because it's way too soon for me, but I want to date you more for sure.

Now, she started avoiding me, like blowing me off and ran into her twice but she didn't wanna talk. 

I asked if she was ignoring me, but she replied that she just wants to be friends and nothing more. 

I replied that I understood I got a bit rushed and atleast meet me and say this. She ignored this message.

I thought over this a lot over a week when I became miserable. 

I sent her a long heartfelt text and that I thought there was a spark between and that I am sorry if I did anything wrong. 

She replied that she read the entire thing. And that she's a bit lonely and wanted us to be friends. And asked if it would be weird for us to hangout. I replied I did like her and let's just hang out and see where it goes. 

She agreed to this. 

Hung out with her twice over a week. And the second time, she said it was weird hanging out with me. I said it wasn't, anyways she left. 

A couple of days later she asked about my holi ( hindu festival, played with water and powdered colours) plans. I told her we will plan something. And I invited her. 

Then, by chance, I hosted a Holi party with a couple of my sister's friends. I invited her, and she agreed to come. 

In the party we hung out and made out when she was leaving. 

On the way back to her house, she asked what I thought about dating her, I told her she already knew where I stood. And replied, let's give it a shot. 

Later that same day, a couple of hours later and asked if I could meet her, she had to leave afterwards for her aunt's place. 

We met, fooled around a bunch and things reached to third base. 

Anyways, she later left for her aunt's place. 

The next day, she wanted to speak to me and asked if I messaged her friend, I said I did. She asked why? I said because when I thought you were ignoring me I wanted to speak you, it was a shot in the dark. She said I shouldn't have done that. It was weird. I apologized.

Then she said Anyways, I'm leaving for a vacation for 2 weeks and then had some college work for 2 weeks and had to leave for her mom's place after that. It'll take around 6 weeks and that she needs space, and will not be ignoring me.

Over 2 weeks I sent her a couple of dog videos and replied to her stories, got no reply in return, or ignored. 

Then, I ran into her again a couple of days later at the market. I was with friends and it was very windy with dust flying everywhere. 

Spoke to her for about 5 mins and she said she's leaving. I told her to speak to me and that she wasn't supposed to ignore me but it felt like she was. She said she just got back and hadn't spoken to anyone (lie).

A couple of days later, I called her up to ask if she wanted to come down for a walk, she said she was isolated, she might have covid. I said, no matter let's talk on call. 


Spoke to her for roughly an hour. She said her report would come the following day, and she'd know then. I told her not to worry it would be negative and said, I wanted to meet her in person. 

Next day I asked about her report, she replied at 11 in the night, it was negative. 

I said, 'Woohoo! See, I told you. You were being paranoid for no reason'. 

She didn't reply. 

Now, the city's in lockdown, due to covid.

I called her the next day and she didn't pick up. 

Dropped a message ' You missed a lovely weather for a walk'.

She simply replied. 'Another time'

I said, 'The real question is, would you come to walk amid this lockdown'

Again she didn't reply. 





So this is my situation folks! 
What should I do? Do you think there's a scope of a future relationship, cause I really like this girl, more than I've liked anyone before ? Is this a lost cause? Am I overthinking this?

We've been seeing each other for a while now. This is a long distance relationship so we never met in person yet. The thing was, we were into each other. We would send snaps and talk to each other every day in SnapChat. We basically were sharing our lives with each other and we loved it.

Here's the thing though. He have feelings for me but he has feelings for another boy

He actually was very honest with me. It bothered me sure that he is talking to other people but I understood that he wasn't ready to be exclusive. What bothered me though was he also has feelings for the guy, the same way he has feelings for me.

The problem is, I have OCD and it made it hard as hell to deal with me not being the only one in his heart. I did my best to just let things be but it just ate me from the inside. To the point that it causes me to not have energy to do my homework and other activities. Being in lockdown also didn't help. I also didn't help that this is my first time falling in love with someone and being in such a close relationship.

I did my best. I've gone in and out of my mood and personality just to get comfortable with that fact that there is another person.

He liked us both. And I know he truly loved me. But I can't continue if meant that I am giving him all my heart but he would only give half his back, the other half to the other boy.

I could've just waited and just let things see through but my OCD is eating me and it is affecting my studies. Our age gap was 13 years and he has a stable life and had a lot of achievements but me, I'm still a freshman in college. So of course, I can't let anything affect it. I need to focus on my studies not ruminating and being disabled by all these anxieties. I love myself too much just to fail my studies.

With that I left him suddenly. I sent him a letter explaining the why's of me leaving and just left out of a sudden. I also reassured him in that letter that what happened was not because of him, but was because of me. If I'm a much more mentally stable person I may have stayed. But I wasn't, so I left. I can't kill myself. Loving is painful sometimes but when it becomes painful everyday just because of an issue I have with myself then it's not good to stay. Especially when this is my first time.

I'm just really busy with my studies that if I kept on with it I would suffer. I can't tell him to choose too because that would be a dick move. I can't control what he wants. I can only control me. So with that I left him suddenly.

So the question is, am I a ghoster? I sent him an in depth explanation of why I suddenly left. I only did this yesterday so I haven't heard from him yet. I didn't block him. I only said that I won't be using SnapChat for a while. So meaning no SnapChat. I left my name in the letter though so if he truly wanted to talk he could search other social media.

But still, am I a ghoster in this situation?

Later a girl comes to the game and we start chatting. The stream ends but we keep talking about stuff. It was good, later on we started dating. It was long distance, i decided to visit her. It was the best 5 days of my life. For your information i've never had a ""real"" or ""deep"" relationship that lasted like idk 5 years maybe... This one was full of emotions and felt really good at the time. The only issue was that she recently broke up with her ex and i was basicly the rebound. She dumps me cuz im not there (in her city) starts another relationship with this other guy whom i happen to made us friends with. Anyways i say i need time and stop talking to her. 

Fast forward to 2020 covid starts, she is in another country to study. I see her in my dream doing a glass bird, (she was studying illustration i had no idea about glass smithing stuff) she says that she changed her branch and now she is doing glass work and she had a bird to do in mind. At this poing I am amazed how my dreams can tell me whats going on about other people. Anyways we start chatting again and stuff, we move the conversation to discord we watch some anime together, Berserk in fact i suggest it amazing stuff. Covid starts to take off and she decides to come back home, she stays in quarantine for 14 days and all that. We both got online school and we talk from time to time, i dont feel bad cuz we are not talking all the time, i used to get that when i had feelings for her but now its all good. Maybe thats cuz i dont have feelings or maybe cuz i am grown and know life is life. 

 Fast forward to 2021 April.  Refik Anadol is having a gallery and she wants to see it. Its in my city, we can go together. We agree on that, she drives to my city, we meet, i somehow ended up with buying her white tulips. She loves it, we talk, we drink coffee, i say silly stuff like ""i only drink coffee when im out with you"" cuz im not usually a coffee guy, she laughs and all, i am happy, it is all good. Next day we go to the art gallery, wait for 2 hours, finally get in good stuff. Had a photo with her and its already time to go home. She was staying kinda out of the city so we couldn't sit down for coffee afterwards cuz of lockdown stating at 7pm. But it is all good because she invited me to their house at 10th of May. 

 Now, it was 24th of April 02.00 AM. My mom calls me and tells me that she is going to her city. I had no idea that this was going on. I think real fast, if covid goes like this the city travels might get cancelled and the plan of 10th of May might fall apart. This might be the only chance i am going to get to see her again. I bought her a record player and a record to play too. This is my chance to surprise her and give the gifts to her. I drive to her city, time flies by 3 am, 4 am, 5.40 sky starts to lighten up, 5.45, i can see the sun peaking thru the mirror. 7.14 I am there. No drama. I feel tired but fine. I write her and tell her that i am in her city. But she is asleep. I decide to sleep on the car untill she wakes up. Maybe should've waken her up i don't know do tell what would've been the logical thing to do in this exact moment too please. We go to a hotel thats an hour away from her house to rest a little bit. Btw, it is saturday and there is a lockdown on weekends, but if you have a hotel reservation you are permited to travel. She wakes up and obviously shocked. I tell her to come to the hotel so we can chill here and i can get a little rest while she drives. Her dad don't approve at first cuz of the lockdown and it would be a gamble to go there without getting a ticket. I convince them if you have a hotel reservation it is ok to travel, i tell the hotel reception to write down the reservation and send a photo of that so that is basicly your permit to travel.. 

At first they were ok but then she got scared so i said fuck it im coming to you. I zoom 103km in 45 minutes and finally see her standing on the door. Still in her bed clothes looking shocked and happy at the same time. We hug, i give her the gifts and go in. At this point i am really tired and also kinda feeling guilty because i pushed the ""come here"" thing a bit much. I am thinking her dad is really pissed at me and lucky me they are having a business meeting and things are not looking too good so he was already pissed. She shows me the house, we sit down in the kitchen and i tell her now is a good time to get that coffee she was supposed to give. ( something happened i told her its ok you can pay it back with a coffee) Little inside jokes and all. I am happy, we are talking and it is almost too perfect. I am kinda scared of her dad being pissed at me but it is ok i guess. Her mom comes in we greet each other, say im sorry i popped out of the blue like this and she says its ok and i am welcome. I like her mom she is the best. Her dad walks in and he is really pissed i say the same he says its ok and goes back to the work. I am very very sad i made this happen by coming here and she comforts me time passes we eat and keep talking. That day was amazing, we listened to the record and talked art and stuff. I didn't know if i would be able to see her the next day so i said ""i might not come back tomorrow hug me for real"" Best hug i've ever had :') 

Lucky me we get to see each other the other day(sunday) too! But it was this day where i realized that i still want the old us back. We talked about her past and the things are very very upsetting to me. I genuinely felt a little pain in my heart, the things happened to her made me feel pain... She was all over that literally laughing at the things but it was a bit much for me. She always had a problem with getting friends and stuff, telling these things might be why i said to myself. But i wasn't just a guy she just met so i guess she opened them up to me cuz i am, you know me. She said she wants a real relationship not an amusement and all. She said there is a guy whom she might get that kind of relationship with. She said that person must have a plan for life, if he is in school he should be a harworking student. I tought ""heh she is  describing me"" to myself. I didn't say anything tho. Cuz she mentioned that other guy... I didn't make any moves, maybe i was scared of getting hurt again, but i am still hurt knowing she already has a guy in mind that fits the description is also hurting me. She didn't say like ""he is the one"" but he was just a potential person to try. She did say she is still waiting for ""the one"" but i am so broken right know... We smoked joes and she got sick and the day was ruined. We dropped her to her house hoping her parrents don't suspect a thing. 

 That night i come home at 3am Monday. Feeling like shit. The car broke down and had to call for a tow truck. Worst ride back home ever. I feel sad but don't know why. I talked with my mom, said i might have discovered some burried toughts. I always said she is just a friend we are just friends to myself but my subconscious had other plans. She was the love of my life and i had no one after her. 3 years of loneliness can get you in a state like this fellas. I too want a real relationship, someone to walk the road i call life together. You know all the cliche sayings no need to write them all down. I guess what answer i am looking for is, i think i still love this girl or i want to love this girl or i fell in love with this girl again. What? How? It hurts ok? It hurts cuz i don't think she wants me back. If she did she would've made a move right? Is she not making a move cuz i might get scared? Cuz she was the one to break my heart back then right? But yet again i think is she really this considerate? Most of the time she isn't. I am definetly overthinking this. She don't like me like i like her. Plain and simple. Mom is a psychologist i opened myself to her, cried a bit. She said i should start caring for myself. I am fat. She might not like me like this. She did before but i was just a rebound so... Yea...  I started to work out and eat healty after talking with mom. She said i should imagine myself (my hot self) on a beach without a spesific woman no faces, just a silhouette, see if i am happy seing that. I felt nothing. It wasn't that. Then she told me to imagine myself looking into the mirror. I did, me smiling to myself, me loving myself did felt good. I am going to try, but still, the things she told me comes to mind and i go into this mad tought train of how much i suck, how much i couldn't be and all. I could've been a beautiful boy and made her feel things when she looked at me. She said she don't deserve me when we broke up. Years ago. Someone else told me this before too.. But what do i deserve? Not a fat body for sure, i am working on that but.. I am just.. I just want to cry. And i do, but when will it stop?

On the second date we spoke quite a lot and on the train home she even was lying on my shoulder while we were chatting. I paid for everything on both dates as i chose to.

We speak every day on snapchat (that's just our main way), i do have her number and what not but yeah. She works a lot and is always busy and on top of that she lives about 40 mins on the train away (not too big of a deal), however it can be hard to just catch up in the afternoon or plan to just hang out for an hour. I feel like sometimes the conversation can be really dry and sometimes really good, sometimes she replies quick and sometimes it takes hours (mostly during the day when she is working, which is normal). After our second date (last friday - 3 days ago) she told me we wont be able to do something for 2 weeks as she is quite busy and that's good and all and fair enough.

I feel like everything is going good, she's still talking to me so i think she likes me and we have hugged and stuff a bit (we almost kissed at the end of the second date but she told me she doesnt really kiss anyone til she is in a relationship and thats okay, i can respect that). I'm not trying to be pushy or clingy or anything, just trying to be me but sometimes i feel like i come off needy or something when i dont mean to, i have backed off with how quick i reply to messages and what not (she is the first girl i have dated in over a year and a half).

We both agree that honesty is super important and last night i told her i liked her cause its been on my mind and i wont be able to see her for at least 2 weeks so i just said it to her. She told me 'I appreciate the honesty, i like you too, i really do' followed closely by on the topic of being honest that she has been/or has seen others (i cant remember how it was worded) since we arent exclusive, and its true, we aren't its only the second date. It threw me off a little bit but i had expected it and since we aren't exclusive it's expected.

I guess i'm just a little confused with the signals, she tells me that she likes me, held my hand on first date, hugged me and talks to me every day but still (maybe?) seeing others. Is this a normal thing? Am i over thinking?

Since then, I have been on and off dating apps over the past few years and have been in brief relationships.

Also, I have experienced a handful of weird ghosting behavior from some men in the SF Bay Area. I noticed that quite a few of them will reach out to me months or even years later to reconnect again. I suppose I didn't know how much to invest in a potential connection. Although I am confused when that happens, I have no hard feelings and accepted ghosting as normal behavior. Perhaps, the men matured a bit and felt bad for ghosting me like they had in the past. Even a guy I've only met up with for brunch reminded me that any guy would be lucky to be with me. I think I tend to go with the flow and follow a guy's lead, so I prefer someone who is equally involved in planning a date. Sometimes those matches on dating apps led to great conversations and friendships. I don't regret those types of conversations turned friendships.

**Realizations:** One of my friends said that I'm not a lazy dater, but I like to be taken care of and respected as a person with feelings. Therapy has definitely helped me see that perhaps the men I have met through dating apps haven't treated me with the respect I deserve. My friends have reiterated that I deserve so much better. I'm worried I have become jaded as I worry that I'm too much, too honest, too open, and too patient. I don't want to become pessimistic after being blindsided and love-bombed with sweet words. My best friend made a good point about feeling frustrated as she watches me go through cycles with disappointing men. I'm acutely aware of the power of language and realize I feel very uncomfortable when men continually use ""girl"" in their speech. I've met quite a handful of late 20-something-year-old men with Peter Pan Syndrome looking for something convenient. 

In the past year, I redownloaded dating apps on and off mostly due to social pressure to be with someone in my ""prime"" mid-20s. While my heart gets a bit wounded and disappointed, I'm an open book and love to love. At my age, I don't think have the patience or energy to heal men and be in a disposable rebound relationship for those not over their exes. They're not bad people, but I don't want to cry over self-serving men. Even though the pandemic had made me more hesitant with meeting up with matches, the pandemic allowed me to think more about non-negotiable values and acceptable behaviors in a potential partner. I realize that I would rather spend my time doing solo activities like reading books, taking classes, and creative writing. When I spend a weekend dating myself, I like to visit museums, buy myself flowers, and enjoy reading a good book with a cup of tea. The right person will enjoy wholesome activities and trying new experiences with me. Doing these sorts of things for myself has made me realize that it's not worth waiting for someone to experience these types of romantic things when I can do this on my own. 

**Deleting Apps:** After taking some time to reflect and talk to friends, I deleted the actual dating profile accounts instead of temporarily putting my accounts on pause or deleted apps off the phone. I also decided to remove social media platforms from my phone to mute the noise around me. Sometimes I feel like I'm being jinxed when guys tell me that they hope that I find someone great. I suppose deleting the accounts instead of pausing sounds abrupt, but I was starting to get sick of men searching for a ""foster"" girlfriend and looking for idealized happiness within someone else. As I reflect on the dating app experiences, I don't think I've been able to develop genuine romantic love with someone I met via a dating app. I've come to learn that true happiness is found within yourself. I'm completely backing off to really focus on myself. As a shy awkward millennial, I'm not sure how long this intentional break away from dating apps will last. A part of me is wondering how I would meet someone genuine outside of dating apps. Though, this time around, I'm not sure if I ever want to go back to dating apps after this break.

Of those 5 matches, 4 said they found someone else and 1 was only interested in a hook-up. So yeah totally useless. 

Back in college, I used to get approached by a decent amount of girls, but they were all unattractive. So I just politely rejected them and kept them as friends. They have given me good tips on what photos I should be taking and what hairstyles I suit etc. 

I'm planning of going to clubs with the lads, in hopes I can pull a fit bird with my grooves. If I still can't pull one after a couple months of doing that. I'll likely just give up for a few years and try pumping iron in the gym, or any other coping mechanism.

We aren't girlfriends, we're just idk a thing(?), like we're not sure aaaaa Idk how to explain it, I still don't want any type of relationship yet

What I mean is it's safe, I won't get covid

Buuuut, I'm really scared to ask my parents to go, I still haven't told them about this girl, I've been calling her ""my friend"" ( oh and they know and are ok with me being gay ), I'm afraid they'll won't let me go because of covid, but I'm sure it's safe.

We got high and cuddled a little and then we woke up with a lot of buzz in our body. I said ""I think I'm buzzing for you"". Which made her blush 🤣. Then she pauses, looks at her crotch ""I think I've just got my period"". She went and did a thing, it was all very funny and the air was charged with excitement that came out as laughter. When she came back She asked ""Are you in love with me?"". Me: ""Nah, but I like you alot"". Her: ""Well I don't feel the same way"".
When she said this, I felt the attraction transform into a kind feeling of friendship and I walked away really happy. All I did was honestly spoke my mind out of curiosity what will happen and I was glad that we can discuss things like this too with my friend.
I still got the hots for her cause she's an awesome person and I'm sure I'm not neutral to her either, but I will be happy with her being my friend.

TLDR at bottom of post. 

I went on a few dates with this woman I met online. I liked her, but felt like she had a lot of walls up that I couldn’t knock down. We went on three dates, I suggested a fourth to give it one last shot, because although the dates weren’t amazing, I knew that I liked her and thought that dating her might require more patience.

Anyway, she declined the idea of a fourth date and apologised and explained she wasn’t she if she was ready for a relationship and explained various things that she had on in her life that were causing her stress (moving house, new job, new country, cousin had died from COVID, etc). All very good reasons but when you hear that, you assume ‘not ready for a relationship’ means ‘not ready for a relationship with you’.

I moved on, completely forgot about it, and then a few months later she messaged out of the blue to say that she had been thinking about it a lot since we last spoke, regretted how she handled it, said lots of other things and then explained that despite going on dates and being 25, she isn’t very experienced (her words), has never been in a relationship or had many guys show her much interest before - she said when it’s happened before she’s panicked and shut things down ‘for some inexplicable reason’. 

She said she wanted to see me again, because she does like me and wants to continue getting to know me. 

Her reasons sounded fair and I appreciated her openness and willingness to communicate openly, so I said yes, I’d be up for continuing to see her too. We’re going for dinner on Friday. 

I’m looking forward to it, but I dunno, slightly wondering how normal this all is as I haven’t been on this situation before. Have any of you been in similar situations and had any success stories m?

TLDR: I went on some dates with her, she didn’t want to go on anymore dates as she had a lot going on in life, she messaged me two months later saying she wants to see me again and regretted ending things.

Like, some of these guys give me real anxiety, and I don't know if I'm overthinking it, some of these guys just don't know any better, or if this just makes it easier for a guy to flake later on?

Like, I've noticed a pattern. When a guy asks me out, and he gives me a clear indication of our plans right away, the date is more likely to be successful.

But then, when a guy asks me out on a very vague ""date"", the plans usually end up falling through. Even if a day has been set.

I have a date set-up for Saturday with this guy from Tinder, which I was kinda into, but the way this guy is moving now is making me very uncomfortable and anxious. I'm trying to determine if I'm overthinking it or if this guy is too young to know how to take the reigns, but I really hate when people make plans but kind of just leave it open ended or vague.

The times guys have done that they have ended up flaking.

Like, it was even weird with the way he asked me out. He asked me on a date, and I said I was free Saturday or Friday. He chose Saturday since he's off, but I let him know it'd have to be after 5 pm since I had previous plans. Then, he said, ""Okay, just let me know."", which was weird for me since I thought I was pretty clear. So, I reiterated that I was free after 5 pm, and it shouldn't be a problem.

After that, his responsiveness kinda took a nosedive. Like, he asked me for my snapchat, which I don't have. Didn't talk to me for a day or so, then came back, said he thought he replied (sure dude smh), and asked me for my number.

So, I gave him my number the next day, and he texted me, but after like 2 texts, I asked him how his day was, and he just didn't respond.

Now, I totally get people are busy and have lives and what not, but I'm just getting out of a situationship where the guy's communication was dodgy. I ignored it because ""some people aren't good at texting"", and it ended up biting me in the ass. I also find it weird he still hasn't given me any clear plans for Saturday, and HE started a conversation with me just to drop it and completely ignore my question. So, now, I'm extra cautious.

This guy was super responsive before, which means he can be, but ever since I agreed to the date, his consistency has completely fallen off. I mean, we've only been talking for like a week. This switch up is hella sudden and sus.

So, again, I'm wondering, is this normal? Do guys ask women out and just leave things up in the air until the last minute like this? Is his communication shift also a red flag?

Like, there are so many things I could be getting into on a Saturday night. I don't want to leave that space free if this guy is just going to not come through. I'm thinking if he hasn't let me know anything by Wednesday night, I'm completely justified in just letting him know I'm not into it.

I asked if I could kiss her, but since it was a first date, didn't want to assume she'd be cool with it. She proceeded to tell me that she didn't know what that meant for her ""relationship status"" and that she had been in a relationship (only one in her life) a while back and that it was ""intense."" I didn't know what to say to any of that but ""It's cool - you didn't freak me out."" She then lingered in my car for like an hour spacing out until I decided to head home. So, I walked her to her dorm and left. Looking back, maybe she just wanted a lay and the rest is superfluous. 

But here's where I get a little annoyed: a guy does all the work to break the ice, ask someone out, plan a date, time, place, activity. Then - in this instance - carried the weight of the conversation and took all the dares in terms of physical touch (holding hands, going for the kiss). And then, I get ghosted for 3 days before finally sending a message that essentially asks for a confirmation of her disinterest and she responds in kind.

Recently however, my girlfriend has been venting her frustrations towards me than towards the problem. It's not often, but she would have these random outbursts of anger towards me when she is stressed out or going through something, like why take it out on me.

She told me yesterday that I come across as if I don't trust her (despite me telling her that I do) and that she understands that trust needs to be earned overtime. 

The problem she's been having with me is that, to her, I do not like her male friends she hangs out with and that I act differently around them. She told me that it's as if I'm jealous. Which is weird because she told me in the past that she gets a bit jealous when I'm around my female friends (which hasn't even happened since I've met her due to lockdown).

Now, she could just be reflecting these problems on to me, but I really don't have a problem with her having these friends. I told her so and reassured her that it's perfectly fine because I trust that she won't do anything, yet she still funds this an issue. 

Apparently when I'm around them I act low-key different and don't come across as the same. I literally have no idea how can can ""act myself"" if myself isn't even right in these situations. I'm even scared of acting like myself now

I'm a 26 year guy and I never had any girlfriend or intimate relationship before with a girl. I feel it's still holding me back in life and makes me very (sexually) frustrated. Every time, more and more, I start to think that all girls are monsters and prosties.. And that's not a tought that's going to help me.! . Lately, I'm in therapy cause all sorts of triggers in daily life are making me so sad, angry, powerless.. 

As a younger guy I used to have no confidence at all, a nice guy, overweight, socially anxious... But when I had some internships abroad and did a world trip 2 years agos, I got my confidence back, lost weight, blabla, got older...I have a lot of friends, take care of myself. And, apparently I'm very good looking now! Due my finances and corona, I still live with my parents, but that I realise I have to move out as fast as possible. 

I've been on tinder for a long time and didn't have any good experience at all. I got a real good profile and bio, got a lot of matches.. Girls start talking to me. But all the girls want attention and texting, and if I arrange a date, they just don't show up, cancel, don't respond.. Still, I had some first dates but never heard of them again.. 

Offline I asked like 10-20 girls out already but I keep on getting no's or some girls kept me on a leach for a long time .. Is all about the numbers? 

Anyway, MY QUESTION , wtf is wrong with girls, online or offline dating or me? , I noticed being a dick gets you girls. But I'm not a dick or a nice guy neither.. But there has to be something off with my behaviour, the way I walk and talk.. Is there something I could learn somewhere or some how? I've read Mark Mason's ""Models"" the other day and that was helpful. Anyway, guess a guy has to be lucky as well, but I've had bad luck for about 10 years now and it's making me insane..

I'm posting it here in this sub, on the advice of the mods of the r/relationships sub, who removed it from there and recommended me to post it here instead. 

T**L/DR:  I am 32, still living at home in a little dead-end town; an unemployed  ""mature"" graduate struggling to find work. I have very little money and  don't own anything. I am what most would call ""a loser"" and even a  ""weirdo""  because of where I am in life given my age. But I am a kind,  loving person who desperately wants that special someone in my life.  Where is the best place to look? Is it even possible anyone would give  me a chance or be interested in me?**

I'm so unsure as to how I should begin this post.

Perhaps I'll start with some context about myself.

I'm   a 32-year-old guy who lives somewhere in England, UK and still lives  at  home. To cut a very long story short, I went to university when I  was  18, dropped out after just a few months due to not enjoying my  course  and ended up in a warehouse job back in my hometown. I stayed in  that  job for 10 years, before I decided it was time to make a better -  more  fulfilling - life for myself, now that I was approaching 30. I  gave up  the dead-end menial job and left my dead-end hometown and I  went to  university in London where I studied hard for the next  three-years as a  so-called ""mature student"". I graduated last year with  a First Class  Honours degree.

I  left London  (where I had loved living and spent the happiest  three-years of my life)  in the summer of 2020 after graduating and when  the COVID-19 pandemic  was in its early stages. Since then, I have  tried so hard to find  graduate/degree-level employment but to no avail.  At a total loss and in  a state of total despair, I started thinking  about ideas of going  self-employed or starting my own business, but  tbh, in my position with  no money, no savings, and a poor credit rating  (from mistakes I made in  my early 20s with an overdraft) - that is  just not realistic.

So  here I am.  A 32-year-old (almost 33) unemployed loser who still lives  at home  with his mother, in a small dead-end industrial town with no   opportunities. Hardly a catch, am I ?

Is   there a chance for me at all to find someone who might be interested  in  me for dating purposes? I would like to know what kind of sites are   best for people like me to find people less judgmental? I'm a guy who  is  looking for another guy to be in a long-term, committed and loving   relationship. When I was younger, I had two short-lived relationships   and mostly just spent my entire 20s hooking up and ""having fun"". I   really regret that now and feel so lonely. I long for someone to love   and to love me back; someone to now start sharing life with and having   special moments together. But I feel my background and also my current   situation is extremely off-putting to most - if not all - people. The   people on all the apps are just looking mostly for sex and those looking   for relationships are mainly wealthy middle-class people looking for   people who are doing well in life and have it good.

Forgive   my vulgar language, but I just hate the fact that I am at the age I'm   at and I still haven't got my shit together - and that I am where I am   in life. I know it's mainly my fault, and I left it perhaps a little  too  late in going back to university and getting my degree to try and  get  my life together and improve my chances for a better life.... and I  hate  myself for making myself so off-putting and unattractive to other   people. Nobody wants to be with a loser, even if he is not bad in the   looks department (which I don't think I am despite being 32 and most   people tend to think so).

So, I   basically am making this post because I want to know if finding someone   in my current life situation would at all be possible, and where are  the  best places to try looking for people? I mean, where are the best   places where there might be others looking for love and a meaningful   relationship but who aren't super judgemental? Do such places exist?

I   don't have a lot to give in terms of material possessions or money and   stuff like that right now, but I do have a LOT of love and attention  to  give the right guy.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,740529,public,self,Will I find someone in my situation?

I liked this girl in my class and felt like she noticed me too, so on valentine's, I asked her if she was single to which she said she was single but wanted to stay single. I told her I might have a crush to which she said nothing,, then I said we could still be friends, and she said we were friends (third time I ever talked to her).

A week later the lockdown happened and neither of us texted. Sometime later when things weren't improving I started talking to her over text, and later she told me that ""I was the first person that liked her, she made friends with and that she never does that"", and that I dont expect that talking to her will get me anywhere. 

We share two subjects so kept in touch and became close friends, I was okay with that, but I was very sure that she would drop me hints on insta, (she is an introvert) and we followed patterns where I would text her once every 10&gt; days, and she would post a story or something (which she wouldn't otherwise) which enabled me to do that.

Later I felt like I shouldn't assume things before it's too late, but it was already too late and I had developed feelings for her, bcuz I was very sure that she liked me back. So in December I asked if we were going to be anything more than friends, (unluckily for me she was in a very bad mood that day, something to do with some unknown caller harassing her) to which she said no, and that we talked about it before. Then I told her I had feelings for her, and she said she didn't want to ruin our friendship, and that I was a close frnd and she liked me as a friend and that's it.  So we decided not to talk until I get over it. 

We talk now, but she is still single and I would hate it if she starts dating someone else. How do I get over this partial rejection, wherein I am not completely friendzoned, as there is still this tension b/w us , but not her boyfriend, as relationships always end and we don't want to get hurt. 
Moreover, thanks to the lockdown I don't meet new girls and don't feel like spending that much time on anyone anyway.

“Looks get you in the door, personality keeps the relationship”.

That’s all very well and good. But I can’t get that door open.

Girls have never treated me as someone who they found attractive. Despite the amount of effort I put into myself everyday to make sure I come off that way.

I always see girls with as good looking as they are. It always has to match perfectly or be better aesthetically and genetically.

It can never be a non conventionally attractive person unless there is an outspoken reason of guilt that makes them choose them and makes them then feel better about it.

I’m sorry, if you think looks don’t play a huge role (and I mean more than 50% I think it’s 75-90%, you are delusional.

If they do not see you as attractive no amount of confidence, style, work ethic, money effort will change their lack of attraction towards you.

Ok I should NOT be laughing about this... but it's actually so embarrassing so how could I not laugh at this point. I've been seeing this guy since Halloween and we have hung out almost every weekend since our first date. We had never talked about being exclusive so I was under the impression that we were both somewhat seeing other people. He is the only one that I've invested more of my time in but I have been going out to meaningless dates here and there. I ended up meeting someone that I connected with immensely on a sexual level (about 1 month and a half ago). He was the only other person that I had sex with without a condom. I ended up spending the weekend with my main guy and this was days after I first hooked up with the other guy. Long story short, my main guy texted me  two days later and told me he tested positive for chlamydia. I was shocked and embarrassed by this. The main guy was extremely understanding and he wasn't even mad at me. He wanted me to get tested ASAP in order for us to start the antibiotics together. Honestly, it felt weird how incredibly understanding he was but I'll take it. Anyways, I ended up telling the other guy about it and told him that he needs to get tested as well. Tbh I was almost 100% convinced I got it from the other guy since he was the only guy I had sex with without a condom. He got tested but his result came out negative which was strange but whatever. I waited the 7 days for the antibiotics to do their work and I ended up meeting with the other guy again LOL. ANYWAYS. Long story short.....I had sex with the other guy again (this was very recent) and days later....I went to go see my main guy and we of course had unprotected sex because I was 100% sure I didn't have it anymore since the other guy said he came out negative and I had taken the antibiotics and so did my main guy.

WELP jokes on me cause last week on Friday...my main guy texted me and told me he has chlamydia AGAIN. This time he wasn't as understanding. He sounded hurt and angry. Which is completely understandable. He asked me if i was fucking other people and I admitted to him that I was. I explained that I didn't know where we stood because he would never mention exclusivity so I was under the impressions that he wasn't interested in that just yet. He admitted that it's not completely my fault nor is it ""cheating"" since we both never talked about being exclusive so he left me off the hook for that one. He then proceeded to say that he doesn't want me fucking other people anymore and that's when he asked me out to be his gf. LOL Like huh???? I gave him chlamydia TWICE and he still wants me to be his gf?? WTF. 

I agreed to be his gf since I genuinely always have a good time with him and we've never really had problems/fights since we've been together (6 months). We talked more and we both ended up laughing and making a joke about this.....like it had to take 2 STD's for us to finally make it ""official"" lololol.  Afterwards, I contacted the other guy once again and told him about the situation and that he needed to get tested once again. I also let him know that I can't see him anymore since I'm technically in a relationship now. He was super understanding and cool about the whole thing. I truly feel bad over the whole thing and what I put him through. I definitely should have been way more careful and I think this is what I get for trying to still ""play the field"". It feels good finally define the relationship so hopefully this lasts a while.

Not when you meet someone or also in those cases. To be honest I don't know if I am ready. I am very insecure and I have been working on it a lot. And in most aspects of my life I have definitely gained confidence. I am still not where I want to be but I am getting closer. 

However, one aspect I am still not even close to being secure is relationships. I think I have good enough intuition to not pick the wrong guys as in abusive or too intense. Although never say never. However I just can't let loose. The insecurity of dating makes me a mess and I kind of lose my mind. I don't know if I could be able to function in a relationship. I constantly look for things that aren't right, I don't trust my own feelings and I can't deal with the fact that I am putting a lot of trust into another person, which to be honest I can never fully know. 

On the other hand I also fear being left and that a guy is just lying when he says he likes me or enjoys my company. As a result guys who seem to be sure of what they want give me stress, on the other hand guys who don't know what they want make me insecure. But how do you even improve relationship insecurity without being in one?

I've been talking to this guy on and off for about a year. Our communication has intensified since the start of the year and we now speak daily. We finally went on our first date over the weekend, which went amazingly, other than the fact he arrived late but only due to train delays and called me constantly until he arrived and apologised profusely.

We also got very drunk and at around 2am, one or both of us made the exec decision to go back to my place. We got a little frisky but no sex that night, and knocked out.

The next morning however, we woke up... spooning like we'd been in a relationship. We then intimately made love, full on kissing and staring into each others eyes. It was natural and passionate (I recognise that type of sex, or at least I think I do). We then stayed in bed until he had to leave / I had to get ready to head out.

He text me a few hours later to thank me and said he enjoyed himself. Upon leaving, he also reiterated how amazing the date was and we kissed goodbye. We've spoken since and got on a phone call (which I requested), the night after the date, to debrief (as we were pretty wasted). I vaguely remember us having some kind of heart to heart and him expressing he sees a future with me, to which I agreed. Now this all sounds crazy because yes it was the first time we'd met. But because of our ongoing dialogue, daily, we've pretty much gone deep very quickly and I guess the comfort was built up there.

I don't know if I'm being paranoid or if things have changed? Maybe even from my side. I know everyone says this, but I'm super particular about who I bring home, it's too personal. So I'm confused how it happened. But even moreso confused at the fact we had sex consciously the next morning - that's not happened for me before. He also kinda agreed on the phone, it's a first. 

I don't even know what I expect from this situation. In a way, I like this phase of feeling each other out and don't want to ruin the build up or know too much too soon, it's nice to go with the flow. But I'm also not stupid and know some, not all, men do judge women for having sex on the first night. He hasn't necessarily said that though, but he hasn't really spoken about our intimacy either.

Everything about the relationship was perfect. We compliment each other well and our personalities really align. The only catch is that he thinks he would like children and his family dislikes me and would like for him to provide grandchildren. 

He doesn’t want to break up now, but feels in his gut that he would like to explore a life where he can have children, and is unsure about being open minded to other possibilities of how that happens (I cannot have any more). We’ve had the conversation over and over again and the result is always the same. He is confused.
