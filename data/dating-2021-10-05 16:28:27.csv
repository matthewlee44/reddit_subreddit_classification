0,q2660p,1633469653,Give up or sort it out?,"For context, my boyfriend (19m) and I (19f) have been going through slight issues. Luckily, none of our issues are foundational (I think) so it hasn’t been as big of a deal until recently. We’ve been dating for two years and I’m not sure if I should call it off or not. 

What’s going on: my boyfriend and I have the same friend group and one of the girls in the group is a pot-stirrer. Long story short, she pulled my boyfriend aside and said some nasty shit about me that he didn’t believe and brushed aside. My boyfriend (we’ll call him Taylor) is pretty close to her boyfriend so she convinced him to speak to Taylor about the “issues” she raised. Well, after hearing this, Taylor decided to pull three other people in our group aside and talk to them about the issues that she brought up. Two of the three people said that Taylor was crazy for ever believing that and they told hum to his face that he’s a bad boyfriend and that I’ve done so much for him. I have NEVER spoken to any of them about our relationship but we spend enough time together for them to pick up on things. 

Well, I didn’t know about ANY of this. Even though everyone had told Taylor to just talk to me about it so our issues don’t make anybody in the group uncomfortable going forward, he had over a month to talk to me about it and we were basically living together at that point. Taylor never spoke to me about it and I had to find out through someone else in the group. After we got back, I was upset. I was sobbing and honestly I was livid that he wasn’t the one to tell me, that I had no idea she was saying this stuff about me to others and  my SO, and that he didn’t exactly care about how I felt about it enough to even hint that something was wrong. I raised my voice because he was just kind of blankly staring at me... He said the I was over reacting and that my reaction was unfair and ridiculous because he didn’t even believe her. He told me in the middle of the conversation/argument that he was leaving and I told him that if he left, I wouldn’t be able to forgive him for just saying he’d talk to me tomorrow when I was more worked up than I’ve ever been. He said he’d “deal with the consequences later”. 

I went to his place the next day where he told me that he (Taylor) wants to go on a month long break with no contact whatsoever. A month of no contact after basically living together honestly hit me like a slap in the face. I know this is only one instance but I can’t help feeling like it came out of the blue. 

Why people/friends think he’s a bad boyfriend: I have changed so much for him and he hasn’t compromised on anything. I think going into a relationship expecting someone to change is extremely toxic and only leads in heart break, but you’re supposed to grow and change in a relationship, right? Our big issues are that he is the worst communicator on the planet (it’s not just an issue of is having different communication styles because it’s like that with everyone he communicates with) and I seldom feel like a priority. He makes me incredibly happy which is why whenever I air my grievances and try to talk about the issues, I let it go and give it another chance without anything from the past being brought up until it again becomes an issue a week or so later. We’re stuck in a cycle and idk if he’s willing to change. 

I’m not sure if this matters but I’ve also been told by multiple people in our friend group that I shouldn’t be dating him still and i know they’re right but he makes me incredibly happy even when we do have issues.

Do I end it or give us one more chance to start over?

Edit: we are currently on the break with NC and it honestly sucks. The break started on October 1st/2nd and we’re ending the break on November 1st but we are having a conversation on October 16th to see if we even need to continue the break, get “back together”, or break up completely.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q2660p/give_up_or_sort_it_out/

4,q26noq,1633471168,Why do 85 percent of 1st dates not go to a 2nd?,"I was thinking about this. I almost always ask for a second date if I’m at least somewhat attracted to her and there’s no massive deal breaker. Usually my mindset is “yeah she’s cute and seems nice. I’m down to go out again.”

 I’m super aware that most people are nervous on the first date, so it usually takes awhile to get to know them anyways.  It would be unfair for me to judge anyones personality just chatting with them for an hour over a beer.

But most of the time when I ask if they want to go out again, I get ghosted or a cliche “no spark / chemistry.” It’s like if they don’t immediately have fireworks with a stranger, it’s a next from them.

I get the impression that people are super excited going into a first date thinking “well maybe he’s super handsome, rich, our personalities will perfectly mesh,” but then when the day of the date gets here, and they quickly realize that it’s just a human in front of them and not a greek God, so they next and go back to swipping.

I’ve seen the same faces on dating apps in my area for about a year now. I’ve went out once with some of them.

So my question is: why don’t people give each other more time to mesh? Like what’s the point of a lot of first dates?

It’s weirdly frustrating. I went out with a woman last weekend who didn’t want a second date. The weird thing is, I’m willing to bet we could have been a potential compatible couple if she would have just gave it a go.

8,q27dse,1633473390,I think he doesn’t care about me anymore,"It breaks my heart writing this but here goes nothing. So, a month ago I had a conversation with my bf (23) because I felt anxious for a whole week and thought he stopped caring for me. He said it had nothing to do with me, he had some family issues and a horrible week. I asked him to talk to me next time something bothers him so I know everything’s alright and maybe I could help. He agreed on it. After that talk my anxiety stopped.

Fast forward to now, well two days ago, I started feeling anxious again. I feel like he stopped putting in effort and stopped caring. The thing is, I can say he cares about me when we hang out, I can see he does, but I can’t see it when we’re not spending time together and just text. I love him and I want to work on us, but I don’t want to feel like a burden to him if I’m overreacting. He makes insensitive jokes and he knows I’m kind of jealous so why do that. He says idk we’ll see to things I propose we do (not all of them but majority of them). The other day he asked me if I like spending time with him and I said I do and he told me “I was hoping you’d say no” and laughed. I didn’t laugh, I was genuinely hurt and he saw that and started apologizing and convincing me he was only joking and telling me he loves spending time with me. 

But, on the other hand, he is genuinely happy for me when I get good news from work or even when my favorite series gets another season. He invites me to hang out with friends as well and he doesn’t put them before me which is a good sign I guess (if we had smthg planned and his friends asked him to hang out he’d tell them he made plans with me).

17,q27ue5,1633474890,I feel like dating is a game of who ghosts the other person first,"Honestly, I’ve been in this game for a while now. And once you’re in it for a longish time, you start to notice certain trends. For example, you can be fully kicking it off with a woman, and then she would just ghost you. Or maybe you just matched, and then send a message, and not even get a response. Or perhaps, she will reply after several hours, then you reply, and then she ghosts. 

So I’ve started just ghosting people now before they do it to me. This isn’t only with women, but with old “friends” and acquaintances who have ghosted me in the past too. I especially am very wary with the people on dating apps who reply really late or have something along the lines of “I either reply in 2 seconds or 2 weeks” on their profile since they’re almost never serious from my experience.

I do this to protect my own ego if I get the feeling that they’re going to ghost me. Because most of the times, this feeling is right, and it’s probably because I’ve seen this film a bit too many times, making it easier for me  predict what’s going to happen.

Those were the most four memorable ghosting experiences i have. I mean, there are more, but those are the ones I remember the most.  


With all ghosting experiences I have, I'm very hesitant about re-entering the dating pool because I fear I'm going to be ghosted again by someone. Mid-flirt, after the first date, after the first hookup, mid friendship-with-benefits, whatever the time is... I have a extreme fear of getting ghosted because I always keep overthinking:

I wanna start flirting again, having hookups, having one-night-stands, having friends with benefits... But the fear of ghosting is really messing up with me.  


Always that I get ghosted, I can't help myself but overthinking and wondering...

""What did I do wrong so that Jane Doe ghosted me?""

This is definitely the worst aspect of ghosting: You keep overthing about what you did wrong. And most of the times, you didn't do anything. But even so... I wish I was never ghosted anymore, but I know I will be.

31,q29zm0,1633482484,"Despite craving companionship, I'm hesitant to make myself emotionally vulnerable in a relationship. What do I do?","**TLDR: I'm a 28M, just out of a bad relationship, feeling lonely and craving a romantic relationship, but afraid to open my heart to someone new and be vulnerable. What do you think? What should I do?**

*Some quick relevant history (you can skip this)*... From when I was 16 to 20 I dated my high school girlfriend into college. She was emotionally abusive, which caused me to shut down and stop communicating my feelings when I'm not happy. It took a lot of self reflection, conversations, and therapy to understand what happened and what affect that has had on me today. I'm aware of my problems, but I still have more work to do. Following this I had a series of relationships, friends with benefits situations, and hookups until i was 24 and started dating my now most recent girlfriend. Fast forward to 2021... I'm now 28 and I broke up with my now ex-girlfriend of 3.5 years about 2 months ago. Long story short, over time the compassion and fun we created together disappeared after we moved cross country and moved in together after only a year. Before that I couldn't clearly see the undiagnosed mental health problems she was experiencing and would continue to burden me with. She was eventually diagnosed with anxiety and Bipolar II after an ultimatum I posed. It was emotionally draining and I didn't feel like myself around her by the second half of the relationship.


After breaking up I moved again and am in a new state for grad school. I did have two random hookups with two women I wasn't really attracted to right when I got here as I was lonely and looking for sex. I definitely felt empty afterwards (I've definitely changed since I last had random hookups years ago) and realized I needed some space from any romantic relationships for a bit. I definitely have this feeling of not wanting to be emotionally vulnerable... It sucks caring about someone and they treat you like crap even if you do communicate the issue.


I was doing good being single until recently. I kept running into this beautiful woman every weekend for 5 weeks at a specific house that threw parties frequently. I really liked her (and still do). She was always very friendly with me and I reciprocated. Long story short, we eventually went on a date despite me being so hesitant! I kept asking myself what am I doing as I had such conflicting feelings with how I liked her but was afraid to be emotionally vulnerable. The date appeared to go well, but for whatever reason she has stopped taking an interest. Which is okay, I have an idea why but these things happen!


But now...  I'm definitely feeling lonely and craving a relationship with someone I care about. At the same time, I'm hesitant to make myself emotionally vulnerable. I'm also well aware of my communication problem and am afraid of letting problems get ahead of me because of it. I find myself messaging people on dating apps and wondering if I really want to open my heart up to any of these people. **Is time the key? Will taking things slow and building trust be my solution? What do you all think?**

The first time we were new to each other learning things about the other while seeing each other for about a month. but she thought I was seeing her friend behind her back so she cut us all off. I should note that nothing was happening as her friend had a bf and we all hung out as a group. 

Between the 1st and second time we didn’t talk for 5 months, the second time around is where my problem begins. We reconnected as friends, talking frequently and ended up taking an adventure to this park close to where we live (Tuesday). 

We had a grand time w her telling me things that had me very moved and attracted to her. She made it seem like she was really happy I was back in her life and I was Happy she was in mine. We shared a few nice moments this day to make it feel special at the time.

Anyways we saw each other during the week, and at this time I also asked a friend of mine who connected us together (one of her friends since middle school and a close friend of mine) if he could just watch my back in case she were to try and hurt me because I liked her more than I usually will than most girls I’ve seen. 

What happened is that on the Friday of that same week I was going away for the weekend to party w a few of my boys and on this day she broke it to me that she just wanted to stay friends. I took it pretty well but I also did wanna see where we could take things. I was not to concerned because I would have my boys as company for the weekend. 

Anyways that same day she went and slept w the friend who I asked to watch my back. I found out when I was back in town after he told me “it was really unplanned and a one time thing”. I was pretty upset and didn’t want anything to do w her and we never talked about it because she didn’t know I knew. I was able to get over it at the time as I was more focused on parties and disconnected from her. 

After this we reconnected 8 months later, I forgot about it as it was not concerned because I had my own life during this time. I started seeing her and have been dating for 4 months now, it is starting to be a very rotten memory that is honestly uncomfortable to think about. Neither of us hang out w the third party or talk to him.  The memory still sits rotten in my head sometimes, I was pretty unbothered by this until she had told a friend of hers I knew what happened and that’s why she doesn’t hang out w the third party. Now I’ve been reflecting, feeling embarrassed and very uncomfortable. Since I was unbothered by it for duration of our relationship until now, I hope I can get to that same place again, but I also don’t know how to feel better?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q2a416/been_sad_all_day_for_what_feels_like_no_reason/

43,q2aoz6,1633485431,Ex boyfriend (25 m) wanted to see other people. Then he got mad when he found out that I (24 f) actually did.,"Earlier this year my ex boyfriend and I were having quite a few problems in our relationship. We had been together for nearly three years. Most of our problems stemmed from us not seeming to have compatible goals in life. 

He was really careless with money, I’m pretty thrifty. He would say I was a cheapskate. I happily pursued the career I studied for. He graduated and couldn’t seem to care less about finding  better or even steady employment. We fought quite a bit about these and other things. It seemed at times that I was dealing with a fully grown child. I was at my wits end and ready to call it quits. He came to me one day after an argument and said he thought we should see other people.

I told him I was mentally and emotionally exhausted by the last few months and I agreed we should break up. But during our conversation said I had no desire to see anybody. I just wanted some peace and quiet in my life and to get my mental and emotional shit together. All this happened in August.

 So I spent most of September alone working, catching up on my shows and taking care of my cats. My friends were making jokes about me being a cat lady (I have two) and being single forever. I was honestly enjoying my “me time” though and wasn’t looking for anything. Then one evening out with friends a couple weeks ago we ran into a group of guys we know. 

One of the guys, Henry (26 m), is the older brother of one of our friend group, Angela. I sort of knew him but not too well. We were more like acquaintances rather than friends. In high school I remember he was always a trouble maker. He was a  cute guy but he never really had much to do with our group of friends.

When I saw him that night I was immediately attracted to him. He seemed way more mature for one. He had been in the army he said and I think that changed him a lot. He also looked really hot. He had shaved his head which is a look not many guys pull off. Plus he had grown a beard. He just looked so good.

I struck up a conversation with him as soon as I got a chance. He still had that sense of humor but he was so unlike my ex. He had his shit together for one. He and I talked about our jobs, he seemed genuinely interested in what I do. His job fascinated me too which surprised him. 

By the end of the night he walked me to my car and we ended up sharing a kiss. One thing led to another and we ended up at his house that night. The next morning when I got home my phone was blowing up with texts from my friends about him. They all wanted to know what had happened between us.

I talked to Henry quite a bit over the next few days and I told him that I was still in the process of getting over my relationship. I said I’d had a great evening and that I thought he was a great guy. I said maybe someday if things work out we could date each other but for right now I just wasn’t easy to start a new relationship so soon.  He said he understood and he always had such bad timing meeting women. We agreed to stay in touch and have been texting and talking a couple times a week. He’s been really chill about the whole thing which is nice. 

The problem is that someone in my group do friends must have blabbed to my ex because he called me yesterday. He seemed at first to honestly be checking in to see how I was doing. The he asked if what he’d heard was true about me and Angela’s brother. I told him we had hooked up and decided for now we were going to be friends but stay in touch with each other.

He got pretty agitated and told me he’d been thinking of me most of the last few weeks and this news had really hurry him. I don’t understand why this so such an issue for him. Our breakup was his idea. He wanted to see other people. I said as much to him and he said he hadn’t seen anyone. I don’t know if that’s true or not. He may just be saying that to try and make me feel guilty.

He went on to tell me that he was going to ask if I wanted to get together some time but now there was no way. I told him that I would have said no to that even if I hadn’t been with Henry. He asked if I was going to date him. I said maybe I would when I was ready and if he was still available. I told him Henry and I had discussed that.

So he hung up really upset with me. I just can’t fathom someone being so upset like that. If he had told me he had slept with someone after we broke up it wouldn’t have bothered me. We both agreed that our relationship wasn’t working. That’s why he wanted to see other people. This is
me just venting. Thanks for reading.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q2aoz6/ex_boyfriend_25_m_wanted_to_see_other_people_then/
44,q2aq2d,1633485540,Is It Wrong to Cuddle With a Guy While His Girlfriend is In Hospital?,"I have a huge crush on his roommate. Unfortunately he has a girlfriend he's been dating for 2 years.

Anyway this weekend she was in the hospital for her drinking problem.

It was just me and this really attractive guy who lives in the room next door, home all alone.

He invited me into his room to watch a movie and because I like him and I'm attracted to him, I went in his bed and laid next to him!

He then asked me to cuddle and while I really wanted to, I couldn't help but feel bad because his GF was in the hospital, so I said no.

I just awkwardly sat next to him in his bed and watched the movie. It was really awkward.

Should I have just cuddled with him? It's not my responsibility to protect his relationship and maybe he would have liked me better if I cuddled/slept with him

She really enjoyed being told that, and loved my honesty about it. However, how she reacted afterwards was kinda confusing.

 She said she takes a few months to figure out what kind of friendship/relationship, but she gets a sense of how that's gonna turn out early on, and I don't seem like her type. However, when I asked her in what ways am I not her type, she says that she's been in an emotionally manipulative relationship before, and she has troubles opening up to other people. And she thinks that someone who's as open and honest as me (her words, not mine) doesn't deserve someone like her. 

I dont fully understand why I don't seem like her type, but it sounds more like she's afraid of disappointing me in a relationship. Maybe there are some things about me which she doesn't like, which I'm gonna have to figure out if she does, but I don't think that she was being fully honest there. I've been rejected before, and this doesn't feel like it.

So I told her, ""I like you, and it's my decision of who's good enough or not for me. And I like you. And I understand it takes time for you to figure this out. So I'll let you take your time, and you can take as long as you need. And if you decide that you don't see that kind of relationship, then I still would have made an incredible friend.

I meant every word of that. She reluctantly, but blushingly said okay. It looked like she was gonna cry. I really do think she's great. Seeing her face like that was kinda beautiful. 

Now im not looking for people saying if it's worth it or not, or if someone thinks I'm wasting my time. I don't care. I've made my decision in that category. What I am wondering is if anyone has been in a similar situation to this. In my experience, it's been either you have feelings for someone or you don't. This is something completely new to me. While she says she doesn't see me as a romantic partner, she seems more like she doesn't want to get hurt.

50,q2az17,1633486444,How common are men who are turned off by well-off and independent women?,"This is so embarrassing I made a throaway account because I need some external opinions and viewpoints but I absolutely do not want this whining and confusion in my main account lol. 

But to make a long story short I have a pretty shitty and empty dating life. And this afternoon I just broke down with a couple of friends, asking why no guy wants me. Without missing a beat one of the male friends says ""it's because you're successful."" A debate started up between the group where the guys all kind of agreed on that point. 

Me and the other girls asked what was the problem with being successful and independent women and the general consensus from the males in the group was: being a pretty and independent woman means that at the slightest fuck up they make I can pack my things up and leave. They felt that in order to keep someone like me they'd have the spend the entire relationship walking on eggshells, and the moment they let their guard down and made a mistake I could just go, and they couldn't invest emotionally in someone that wouldn't be more locked down.

I asked for example of a fuck up and one friend answered that he felt like I would be very demanding of any boyfriend given that I was a hard-working go getter myself, so if he came home to me after a hard day of work and just wanted to rest that I'd look down on him for it. Two guys made a point of how when we met they never hit on me, because they instantly knew that a relationship with me would be hard work. If I were just pretty it wouldn't have been a problem, but the fact that I'm pretty and intelligent, and high-earning means that I can have high standards and they just don't wanna deal with meeting those standards. I have to find someone as exceptional as I am and that's gonna be hard and that's my lot in life and I have to deal with it.

Is this the general viewpoint of guys out there? They said that I was ""over-qualified to be the girlfriend of 90% of men out there"" and I never saw myself as such. My response to my loneliness was to think there was something really wrong with me but here was this group of four men saying that the problem was that my life was good and I made all the right choices.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q2az17/how_common_are_men_who_are_turned_off_by_welloff/

52,q2b54e,1633487062,a rant / also want to hear your thoughts,"for context: me and my bf go to boarding school in mass. we’ve been dating for a bit but neither of us have told our parents yet. he’s korean, i’m chinese, and our parents have more traditional views on things like school and mental health and dating. 

earlier today my bf’s mom told him to call him and that it was an emergency. he called her and basically what happened was she told him that she’d been logged into his instagram account for a while after she told him she’d log out of his account and that she actually knew that we’d been dating. 

this wouldn’t be that bad if not for the fact that he’s on my close friends story on instagram, where i post a lot of my less filtered thoughts. as a result, she saw everything i posted on my close friends story, including one story i posted about my parents that was INTENDED for my friends, who know about the rather problematic relationship i have with my parents, but context wasn’t included in the story, since i assumed everyone viewing the story already knew. she told him that she didnt like me and she wanted him to distance himself from me, because i was “weird” and would be a bad influence on him. 

she also told him that if he didn’t break up with me, she would send my mom EVERYTHING on my close friends story. also, she tracks his location and will use that to make sure he’s not meeting up with me, and also will make him send photos wherever he goes on campus to ensure he’s not with me.

our plan is for him to tell her that we broke up and to act like that on instagram as well, because she has his instagram, but continue to date in private. (in case y’all were wondering i left this decision completely up to him.) 

this situation just irks me in particular because it’s behavior like this from parents that causes kids like me to have bad relationships with their parents in the first place, and i don’t understand why his parents can’t see that forcing him to “break up” with me will only make him resent them more. my parents did the exact same thing but with my text messages with ALL of my friends for over a year before i found out, and it’s only making me trust them less.

And every time it happens it’s a blow to my ego. What do I do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q2cmb6/what_am_i_doing_wrong/

72,q2cr97,1633493229,I’m (21m) probably gonna have my first kiss next week. Yet another guy asking for tips…,"
Hello everyone, sorry for the cliche post lol. So here’s a little background. Me (21m) and her (19f) have been on 6 dates, and we’ve yet to kiss. We’ve hugged many times, cuddling in a movie theatre, but no kiss. Mainly because we both agreed to take things slowly, and because there’s never really been a moment for it cause we’re usually around people. 

We’re both out of town until next week, so I’m planning on doing something with her next Wednesday. I’m gonna take her on a nighttime picnic at a small park near a museum. It’s a really beautiful place, plus I think the nighttime will make it romantic. I’m gonna bring her favorite snacks and some things so we can draw cause she likes drawing. 

I plan on kissing her for the first time. Any tips? I was thinking about asking if I can kiss her when it seems right, but I kinda think that’s awkward. I was told to sit close during the picnic, then when it seems right make eye contact and kinda lean in. I’ve her to “lean in 90% and let her lean in the other 10%”. And apparently when we kiss I should put her top lip in between mine? And don’t worry I don’t plan on any tongue lol

And I know most ppl don't like shy grils so that makes things a little bit harder. Anyway a lot of the times for instance when I'm at the gym or at school, sometimes I find guys staring right at me, and I look at them but then I go back to doing whatever it was I was doing. And trust that It's not because I look weird or because I'm doing something weird. I'm just doing what I always do, on my own. Just regular normal shit. And there've even been times when I feel like guys have gotten mad at me because of this?? Irdk. It's just all so frustrating. Like why do they stare in such a serious way?

78,q2dbjv,1633495624,Bothered by too many red flags. Should I quit this relationship ?,"I’m a foreigner in Poland and started dating my girlfriend through an online app. We have been several months together sailing through the BS that all relationships have in common in their beginning.
What bothers me now is the idea of living together, because it seems too serious for me. And please don’t get me wrong, I want a serious relationship, I’m just not sure if she is the one.
Not sure because she told that she never had a serious relationship before (she is 29) and I can’t wrap my head around that, it seems like a major red flag to me. Lately, she asked me to have sex more “aggressively”. Now of course that also added up to the red flag i have mentioned earlier.
She is also very discreet with her phone, and weirdly, did not add me on any of her social media. I did not ask because back in the beginning I haven’t found her, but I know that she is, because sometimes we discuss about news etc and she mentions facebook or instagram (plus when we are in the metro, I can see that she is scrolling on these platforms).
She’s got also a disabled friend, in his 40’s who is a drug dealer (weed as far as I know). In the beginning, she used to tell a funny story and framing it as if he was some distant friend, but I remember one time she mentioned helping a disabled neighbor…  i was surprised and I said is he the drug dealer ? And she sais no with an embarrassed smile on her face. I acted cool about that and with time, every now and then she would say something about him I would be like: ah that cool drug dealer !! (To not embarrass) her. And we would both laugh. 

These red flags bothers me a lot, especially that I was and still very honest about who I am and what I want.
It’s hard to summarize everything, but I tried to summarize the stuff that bothers me in this relationship. What are your opinions guys ? Please help me. I’m a foreigner in Poland and I have no friends here for the moment.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q2dbjv/bothered_by_too_many_red_flags_should_i_quit_this/

I usually don't go out often, and the current situation is very difficult in a pandemic; when I am with someone, I prefer nights when only the two of us do things together.

Some of my hobbies: Lego models, reading history, or calming down and creating a painting with two people, which is very good. I am more active and usually like it.   
Do some outdoor activities. If you like hiking and adventure, it will resonate with us again. This is a must-have skill. Surfing and diving outdoor shooting training is very cool.

87,q2e97t,1633499758,Matched in Bumble and now he referred me as mate,"This would be a long one, so I really appreciate your time reading.

We matched two months ago. The lockdown started then so we had no chance to meet in person. We’ve been only texting, call a few times during the lockdown. He showed me pretty much interest and said “feeling a huge attraction too”. I kinda like him too though we just talked on the phone.

So we just kept talking on the phone daily until two weeks ago we heard some good news about the end of the lockdown. At that time we weren’t sure how it’d be afterward but he asked me to meet up the following weekend. Saturday was okay for me so we agreed on Saturday evening. Didn’t say anything about place and time to meet yet. I guess we just let it until the day comes. 

One, two days after we talked about meeting, we still messaged. Then he went silent, or he forgot his phone under the chair, or he just less responsive. That made me feel a bit off. Also, thinking about going out after 4 months of lockdown, I didn’t really feel ready yet. Kinda like, my look is shit lol you know what I mean. So I don’t want to appear as not neatly. I also told him I’d feel a bit worried to go out but I’d try to work on it. Both of these made me reconsider. But, I still hit him up on Friday-one day before the day we want to meet to see if he’s still on. He was “yeah I’m good with it.” The thing is I’d drive, he doesn’t, and he’s totally aware of that, and he didn’t even let me know where I would drive to until I asked like “where do I drive to?”  Also no timing offers, like “what time would be good for you? I’d be ready by…” sort of thing. He gave me an unsure vibe, like he didn’t remember we talked about meeting.

Next day, which was Saturday, he checked on me if I’d be ready/ comfortable to go meet up. My anxiety plus his vibe really made me reconsider. I told him I’m not sure. Then he was “it’s Eddy’s birthday party today and if you’re not sure I’ll go socialize with them. It would be nice to see people.” I totally got the socialize thing, so I told him just go with the party cause I didn’t really feel like meeting. Then he was “okay so I know it was not me, it was you not feeling good. We talked for months and we get along well and I want to meet in person, like MATES. If it comes out great, good. If not, we’ll be nice to each other as MATES.  Don’t have any expectations. But you seem not interested…” Mind you, there were a lot of flirting and teasing which I’m sure way more than MATES.

Then he went for the party for 2 days. Not hearing anything from him until Monday evening when I hit him up. Exchanged 3,4 messages and he disappeared again. Now I’m tired and don’t even bother anymore.

This makes me feel like I was just entertaining him the whole fucking boring lockdown. Now when he can freely go anywhere when I’ve done my job? And as a mate? Yeah, and just meet like two mates, not date though. Am I too naive here?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q2e97t/matched_in_bumble_and_now_he_referred_me_as_mate/

89,q2ehwd,1633500880,So here’s my situation…,"So just a little back round I’m a 19 year old guy and in college, also am clueless in the whole dating world (never had a girlfriend). I have a small group of close friends and in public I really have never been one to just talk to people. I’ve always been very shy and just reserved I guess would be the way to say it. 

So recently I met a really awesome girl in one of my classes the other day and I think she might be in to me, I’m gonna break down everything that happened and someone please tell me if she might like me and how to possibly move this along. 

So the very 1st day of class she was the first one that caught my eye, we made eye contact periodically throughout the duration of the class, I didn’t think much of it at first but I’ve slowly developed a crush. Fast forward 3 weeks later we get assigned a project and are given the option to work in pairs, instantly I knew what I had to do but instead of me even approaching her she waved me over to work with her. The whole class we just talked and laughed while doing the assignment, she made little light hearted jokes and she even noticed I didn’t have a chair so she went and got me the one from the other side of our table and put it right next to hers. I feel a really strong connection Just from how easy she was to talk to. I really want a chance to get to know her better but I just don’t know where to go from here. Also I never see her on campus other than when we have this class, which also happens to meet once every 2 weeks.

The very next day, I met a guy on FB dating.  I've been talking to him for the last three days, we've really connected and we were supposed to meet this coming Friday.  I've done the basic background checks that I knew and everything seemed cool and all matched what he told me.

Right before going to bed, on a whim I decided to pay for a background check instead of just the free ones I've done.  

Awesome, there was something on their for guilty of first degree child abuse.  It didn't tell me much, I can't even find how much time he did, and it was 25 years ago, but that is plenty of information for me.  I have a young daughter...no way no how.

I know I barely knew him, but I enjoyed talking to him and I was feeling hopeful about meeting him.  I thought between getting to know him and the closure I recently got from my break up, that I could finally start to get over my ex and now that's all gone to shit.  

What do I even say to him?  I don't know if he's dangerous.  He lives like 10 min from me...doesn't know exactly where I live, but he has my phone number so it wouldn't be hard to get it.
