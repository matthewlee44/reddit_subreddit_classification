I'm a guy who's now 27 years old living overseas in Eastern Europe and I'm trying to get used to the dating scene here. In America, dating was vapid for me in large part because of my disabilities *(ADHD + Aspergers).* In my personal experience, these women were extremely picky and superficial. Personally, I blame Instagram, TikTok and Tinder which has skewed the minds of both men and women due to the near unlimited access they have to people now. There's also an abundance of choice like never before and as such, the women back home *(USA)* tended to only go for the best looking men, especially if they were really attractive themselves. Not willing to give an average or slightly above average looking guy like me a chance. 

Beyond this, the fact remains is that I'm an introvert and not really into social media like most people are. I tend to live a more quiet life and I'm into gaming, manga, anime and whatnot. I'm also a Christian and a churchgoer at that, which most people back in America aren't these days, much less any woman I was attracted to. :(

A hell of a lot of people who use Instagram in my experience can be quite toxic. They'll always post about some extravagant thing in their life and the people I know who use it are ALWAYS doing something outlandish such as vacationing to the Caribbean or Southeast Asia and frankly, I wouldn't want to go on dates and having to take pics or have my GF have the camera in our faces all the time. It's just not my style to be perfectly honest.

I've said this before in past posts. All that I'm looking for is a woman who's traditional, conservative and Christian like me. A couple of friends of mine told me awhile back that if a woman uses Instagram or TikTok, then she's not going to be either of those and from what I can see, it's kind of true. Could be wrong however and I'd hope I am.

That said, I am seriously left wondering where in *mainstream* society can I find attractive women around my age who don't use Instagram or at least not on it all the time? Someone who's more down to Earth and mostly spending time off the smart phone, casually chilling out instead?

I've (M25) met a girl (F24) online via a dating site about 3 or 4 weeks ago. We are both students in University.  
She lives like 200 miles down south (UK) so it's mostly been texting and google meets.  
We have a lot in common, and it's been amazing getting to know her. We aren't officially dating yet.  
In all my past relationships and even friendships, I've mostly been a texter. I usually respond within a few minutes unless I'm at work or asleep.

  
But she usually takes a couple of hours to respond, meaning we don't really get to text much in a day.  


This makes me feel like she isn't into me, although we flirt and spend hours on video calls, usually once or twice a week.  
Is it normal for some people to just not text much despite meeting someone they are exited to talk to? Because usually when I meet someone new, there have been times where I have stayed up all night texting them.

I will probably be visiting her in person towards the end of this month.

We hit it off like nothing I’ve ever experienced before both emotionally and sexually and had so much in common.

We’d meet every weekend since we first met and did things that included trips to new places, long drives, nights out drinking and staying in a hotel for the night. After Christmas I let her around mine and she enjoyed seeing me so much she stayed an extra night even though she had work early the next day and was 30 mins from hers.

During this time she told me how she’s never met anyone like me before, she enjoyed seeing me so much, she told all her friends and family about me and we even had plans to travel to new places in the new year and how she couldn’t wait to start the year with me. She made it clear I couldn’t ever be a FWB and could only ever see me as someone she’s be in a relationship with. 

It then took a turn and felt rather weird on 2nd January and we hardly spoke but I put it down to her being busy with work. 

The next day we had a conversation in which she claimed to not being sure about seeing/being with me as she was scared to trust/be vulnerable again after some bad experiences and she thought she hadn’t been single long enough (4 months) and didn’t wanna hurt me and wanted to stop things. She felt confused and her head was all over the place in which I sent a long message explaining my feels but respected her need for space and that’s id leave it and won’t message her again.

It’s now been two days and we have not spoke and I’ve been left very confused as this has never happened to me before? I don’t believe someone can feel the way she said she did about me and then be able to switch off so easily? All the plans we spoke about? Even telling her friends and family which I knew was true due to messages I’d been shown and Snapchat videos of her family asking about me.

I certainly won’t be messaging her as I know this won’t do my mental state any good but I’m constantly wonder if she will message me again in a day? Or a week? Or never again?

Society tells us that if you are attractive then dating is easier. If you're handsome, funny &amp; have an amazing body, you have it made right?

Not in my experience. It's all a lie.

My face is very attractive, my body is ripped from years of lifting weights. I dress very well and have a great sense of humor. I'm not simply saying ""I'm attractive"", it's evidenced by beautiful women staring at me wherever I go....while wearing a hat.

I've been single my entire life. I had a pretty traumatic childhood, so I just avoided people in general for the first 20 years of life. I never dated in school, I didn't have any real friends. 

I decided one day to change all of that, I began lifting weights and improving myself in any way I could.
I became who I am today, a muscular white guy of average height with a handsome face.

But that doesn't matter....none of it matters.

I decided to start online dating, it seemed easy enough. I set out and took 6 very high quality pictures doing different things in each one. I created a very diverse dating profile with a witty bio. It all seemed so perfect.
Unfortunately, no one told me that none of this stuff matters when you're bald. Zero matches. Zero dates. Zero chances at happiness.

Women love flirting with me in public with my hat on, but without social skills I simply cannot ask them out. I am clueless what to say. I usually just walk away awkwardly, unable to think of anything. 

That's where the idea of online dating came into play. I thought I'd just workout like crazy and then it would be easy to go on dates. 

Hell no! 

Women won't give me a chance. Heavy women won't even give me a chance online.
I've lowered my standards to rock bottom, but can't get a date or a phone number to save my life.

All I've ever wanted my entire life was to have a girlfriend. All I've ever wanted was a true connection and of course sex. But no...love and affection isn't for me apparently.

Had I known this, I wouldn't have ever began lifting weights or improving myself. It was all a waste of time &amp; money. 
All I ever see are guys who don't care about their appearance/body/clothes with beautiful women as girlfriends/wives.

It just boils my blood that I can't even have a glimmer of hope. It crushes my soul and has cast me into a deep depression.

I wish I were dead. It's all I ever dream about anymore. The thought of death is the only thing I can find happiness in now. There is nothing majorly wrong with me, in theory I should at least be allowed to go on one date with a below average girl....but nope....not for me.

We finally had our first in-person date today, and it lasted about three hours (went to a restaurant, got yogurt, and walked around our college campus). I was very quiet and awkward, so internally I suspected there wouldn’t be a second date. We ended the date at her apartment, because I had promised to help her move some stuff. After moving things, I asked if I should stay or go, and she said “you choose”. This gave me the sense that she wanted me to stay, so I went back in with her and sat down. She then sat down across from me and asked if I was staying or going, since I was just sitting there quietly. Since I’m completely clueless and have never been alone with a woman in a romantic context before, for some reason I took this to mean she wanted me to go. So I said bye and left.

When I got home, I asked if she’d like to go on another date, to which she responded “you were supposed to ask to stay and watch Netflix.” She said I made her feel embarrassed and that I shouldn’t come back to her apartment today, as I offered to once she told me this. I apologized profusely since I am socially clueless, and I asked why she felt embarrassed. She told me not to ask her directly why and to instead search the internet for an answer to my question.

I posted on the discord and got some nice words but I wanted to get multiple perspectives.

I separated from my wife about 5-6 months ago and I've done enough work on myself that I feel like I can move on, I asked a woman out who lives about 7 hours drive from me and she said yes. I took a trip to see old friends and her(It's originally my hometown) I feel like we had a really incredible time, I met her kids and all goes well.

I got back home and sent her a text more or less saying that I had a wonderful time and i'd love to see her again, she said something akin to ""I enjoyed your company and i'd like to see you again someday"" but she also said she was busy(full time mom, full time school etc) I'm okay with this and say as much.

Today I tried to schedule a phone call with her to try and make plans for another trip I might take in mid February and I got told over text ""School just started today, kids start school tomorrow and I can't plan anything right now""

I answered(maybe stupidly) that that's fine I'm still interested in seeing her on her timings and that if she wasn't interested in the end I'd understand. She hasn't answered since.

I feel really stupid, maybe I came on too strongly? I don't really know if this is salvageable and if it is I don't really know what to do... I'd appreciate any advice or perspectives.

ESPECIALLY if anyone has anxiety, depression, or avoidant tendencies/fear of relationships/late bloomers, I could really use your point of view here!

Okay, before you guys all jump into ""he's your ex for a reason"", hear me out. We only dated for a few months, were just getting to know each other, he acted so into me, and it's so hard for me to like someone. I was really enjoying getting to know him, but I kept myself guarded, where he was a lot more open with me. I had just met his friends, he wanted to take a trip together, he wanted me to meet his mom in the weeks before this. Like he was fully all-in. Then one day he freaked out because he was confused about his feelings and whether he could see a future with me or be in love with me.

This is was so confusing to me, because I've never been in love (something he doesn't know about me). I can't possibly know if I'm in love after a few months. I haven't even really revealed deeper things about myself yet. I was just starting to get more comfortable letting him in. I expressed to him that I thought it was too soon to have those feelings (he was really upset, emotional, crying about it whereas I was totally calm) and we talked it out. He agreed he was panicking and putting so much pressure on the future for no reason. At one point he said ""what if it's been 3-4 years and we're not in love and we wasted all that time?"" I was like, ""why are you worrying about that? We are taking things slow. It's not wasted time to see how things go, that's what dating is.""

He didn't have a girlfriend until he was 30 and she was toxic and emotionally abusive to him. They only lasted a year. I'm his second ever girlfriend. When we talked about it, he admitted he just got himself all worked up that us not being more serious so early in was a red flag and he panicked. We agreed to just be in the moment and see how things go. I'm more comfortable at a slower pace than his ex was.

Then he freaked out again a few days later and that's when we ended things. That last time I didn't argue, I was just like well, you've heard what I think about this, if this is what you want, okay.

That was 7 weeks ago and we've been in No Contact since. The thing is, I'm still crushed. I've done the work. I'm working on myself, got in great shape, dating other people, etc. And I still miss him because I think he's a great person and I completely understand where his anxiety is coming from. I have regrets that maybe I should have been more vulnerable with him or fought for us again that second time instead of just agreeing to the breakup. I was hoping he'd reach out to me once he got his head together but because he's so anxious/shy, he probably thinks he screwed it all up and it's beyond repair, even if he's now sad about it. He spent his whole life avoiding relationships because of his fear/anxiety and depression.

I want to reach out because I think we had something really great and he just panicked and overreacted. I feel like I have nothing to lose because if I do reach out and he doesn't want to talk/hasn't missed me over the last two months, I think that means he was right and we're not right for each other. I don't think I'd be any more sad than I am right now. I've given him space to think about what he wants and while I wish he'd reach out, I feel like his anxiety and non-confrontational nature won't let him.

But what's stopping me is that maybe I haven't given him enough time. This weekend marks 8 weeks since we've seen each other, next week 8 weeks since we've spoken. So what do you think? Should I give him more time to see if he realizes it on his own (maybe at the 3 month mark) or should I just reach out and see if he'd be interested in talking things through and seeing if this is worth another shot?

Also, he hasn't been dating (we met on a dating app, his profile is still inactive), he posted on social media things that felt like they were to get my attention (he hadn't posted in 3 years prior), and his mom watched my Instagram story a couple weeks ago (we've never met and she doesn't follow me so she had to seek me out). So I feel like I'm at least somewhat on his mind.

TLDR: Ex ended things out of nowhere after panicking about our potential future and now that it's been 2 months no contact, I want to reach out and see how he feels about it. I don't think he'll reach out first because he's got bad anxiety/low self-esteem. I don't feel like I'd be any more sad if I found out he's really not interested, as I miss him a lot now even though I've focused on myself/dated other people. It could actually make me feel better, as I'd stop wondering if I could have changed things. But I don't know if I should wait longer and see if he comes to me first. He's just such a sweet person but he's letting his anxiety/overthinking run his life.

So I’m[M] in quite a pickle with this girl right now[F23]. We met through mutual friends in September and talked at a party and I asked for her snap. After that we started exchanging some snaps here and there, nothing serious. Until one day in October when we started talking more and I eventually asked her out.

We went on a date, I was really really nervous, and she admitted was aswell afterwards. But we both had a really good time. We went on another date afterwards. The thing is I work at sea, and due to Covid quarantines and stuff I have worked alot the last months. Since mid September I’ve been at home a total of 20 days and spent the rest of the time on a ship.

We have still talked alot with each other and I’ve grown really fond of her and started developing a heavy crush. I’m bound to go home in a few weeks and have one and a half month leave. Now I’m wondering if I should ask her currently how things are between us, if she is up to meet still once I get home or whats up. I usually dont put alot of weight on dating girls as they come and go lol. But this one has really caught me and I can’t stop thinking about the situation.

At first she said she didn’t want a relationship, then we met up in person and after talking  about she said  we could see where things go, but my gut is telling me she’s just not taking things seriously.

Like when we’re together it’s cool, but she just doesn’t seem that interested over text.

She’s mentioned how much she thinks I’m attractive and wants to fuck me, she makes me feel super desirable but it just seems superficial in a way I guess. I feel like she’s a good person but I have to guess that maybe she’s damaged or has some trauma to deal with bc I guess both her parents left her, she’s an only child, and raised herself bc her grandparents are really old. 

I could see myself in a relationship with her, but I’m not going to waste my time if it doesn’t seem like it’s something she genuinely wants. I’m thinking of telling her this and maybe I’m being too dramatic but there are similar signs from the last girl I was seeing where they just want a sort of boyfriend without any commitment and when I stop becoming fun or exciting, it’s on to the next.

We met up the night he messaged me and went to dinner and a movie. We had a great time and we planned to get together again soon. He ghosted me for a week (weird?) but actually reached back out with a phone call and a text explaining his situation. I truly felt bad for him, he seemed to be going through a depression or something and maybe felt he needed a break from life and isolated.

I gave him the benefit of the doubt, I had already chalked it up to never seeing the guy again and my self esteem plummeted because the date was so great I was dumbfounded.

We even schedule our 4th date which was yesterday. We went out to dinner, we had a couple drinks and we hung out at his place. 

He made a sly comment like “how soon is too soon to see each other again?” And I felt like he didn’t mean that in good taste but he has initiated every date so I took it as, he really likes me and is trying to slow the breaks or maybe things are going too fast and he needs space? No idea. Regardless, the date went very well. After he walked me to my car and hugged me goodnight I drove home and he did not ask me if I made it back which was uncharacteristic of him since he has done that on every other date, it was also like 1AM.. I texted him anyways and told him I made it back and we’ve texted today briefly…(also uncharacteristic since we usually text throughout the day)

I can’t tell if I scared the dude off or he needs space or what gives but for 4 dates in, I feel like I should have more certainty.

I have gone on A LOT of dates the past 2 years but have a hard time finding someone I like. This is the longest I have been seeing anyone ever and it is making me realise how new it all is to me. I just have a lot of questions.

He literally acts perfect but personality-wise he isn't usually the type of guy I am attracted to. I often have doubts, doubts about how much I like him, doubts about how much he likes me.

 When I go on a date usually I can see on a guys face that he is into me, but with this guy I would have no clue if he liked me or not if he didn't say it to me. He initiates stuff often enough but has never compliments me apart from calling me cute once. I get compliments from strangers often enough and it kinda hurts that a stranger will give me a compliment be he won't. I'm never really sure if he's being genuine when he says he likes me, he says it with a straight face and is very hard to read. I can't tell if he is unsure and just saying what he needs to get more time to decide. He has only been in one relationship before.

 I was also really attracted to him at first but feel less attracted to him than before even though he is exactly my type physically. Little things he does bother me soemtimes (like him being restless or going on a long tangent about work) Usually when I like a guy I just naturally start to like everything about them, that hasn't happened with this guy. 

I ussualy feel good about things when I'm with him and when I get home but start doubting things and being unsure when I spend a week without seeing him. The idea of never seeing him again really upsets me but at the same time I'm not confident about how I feel. I have gone out with so many guys and was not romantically attracted to anyone, I dont want to lose interest in this guy or to scare him away. Usually it is very obvious when I don't like someone, I have never gone out for a second date or been in this weird middle ground.

 Idk if I feel less attracted to him and unsure because I feel like he is not attracted to me?

I've never really been particularly close to my sister. And my mom I'm on good terms with. But recently they've been getting really weird about me dating. At first it was just the innocent little 'you should find a wife already' Which okay thats just playful ribbing.

But lately its been getting weird. 

They know my plans to move to Alaska. And they keep telling me 'Ugh, why would you want to move there? Theres no women up there.' Which wasn't the reason I want to move there in the first place. but thats a whole another conversation.

Then they got my aunts and my grandmother involved. And one day I came home from work, and theres a girl in the living room who I don't recognize. And they basically set me up on a blind date without telling me anything.

Because of that, I've been spending some time working overtime. But each weekend its the same thing. 

I'm still living at home because since I left active duty I came back to figure out my next step. And I'm moving out to Alaska in two months, got a new job and a house all lined up there.

It's like I could go on a coffee date with anyone and come back with basically the same experience. I've been ice skating as a first date before as well, and that one was also pretty boring, even though I love ice skating. I have been on *one* interesting first date where we just went out to eat and then walked around the town for a bit sightseeing/chatting. But even then, that feels much harder to pull of and has to be organic I think.

So Me n this girl, Recently we have been having some trouble. Alright Few months back, We started dating and It we talked about 2 Months, I really liked her, So i confessed, First time and She confessed too. Things went smooth, Until we started getting into arguments, not bigs but over small things which caused us to break up. So, I really did miss her and my friend was talking to her, not Like he liked her cuz he already had a Gf but He was talking to her cuz of me, I asked him to send mth i wanted her to know, And it was mainly because i did really miss her. After, She told us she was moving, Which i got sad for a bit, But then im like it' fine. So I said ""hi"" And she responded, I didn't expect her to at all. So She gave me 1 Week to get her back, Dk why but i thought it was werid, Aight i failed that but then i Told her sm things which made her switch her desision and she didn't tell me that at all, i thought we were friends. Aight, I asked her, What do you think of me, She said ""Bf, Future husband, With a 9 Year old mind (Mainly cuz i did dumb shit before). Okay, Few weeks later, Another breakup occurs, All because of me, I really do want to stab my self for that but it was because every Plan i made wit her, Last min she told she can't do it due to strict parents or Someone else issue she needs to solve, So We broke up. So late night i was trying to sleep, and Everytime i tried, Thoughts of her, ANd i was't trying to think about her at all, So im like ""wtf is going on with me"". I dmed her, She wasn't interested in me anymore And I said My bye's to her and last time we will see/Talk to each other. 20 Mins later, I recieved a text from her, Im like alright, And she was being Rude as f, I was being nice, Didn't say much. okay after, Im like 'Alright Did you really want to text me or not, Ill go with whatever you pick"" Because she was pissing me off, But i was holding it in. She said ""Wbu"" Im lke ""Idc, You pick."". and she said ""Yes"" Surprised. Alright  We talked normally for a bit until she texted me ""Im going to sleep, Bye"" Im like alright, 30 Mins later she texted me she couldn't sleep, And then we went into smth else, So basically, She had this nickname for me Which she only called me cuz She loved me and it was only for her, Idk if that makes sense but She made that nickname for me. So we went into nicknames for each other and she didn't list it, She's like ""{Nickname} won't be used anymore, only for your next girl"", I left her on seen and she said ""hi"" and i said ""hi"" We talked for a bit and I had a bit depression so, She noticed that. Aight, After talking about it a bit, She called me the nickname, And now she uses it everyday. I don't get it but how do i exatly get her back? And i don't know if she still has feelings for me or not. I get why was she trying to be rude, But Im still confused.

I know it’s irrational but I can’t help it…. I’ll go on a date with a girl I end up liking and I get very anxious waiting for her to reply. 

It seems so easy / obvious to me to be more confident / have self esteem, but I just don’t. I don’t know why and I’d love to fix this.

I’m very inexperienced about sex but I feel like I have a strong chemistry with this guy. Other than this, I dont see we have a lot of things in common and this relationship cannot go beyond fwb.

After we start our fwb relationship, the guy texts me more often. He cooks everytime he visits my apartment, and always acts like he is very caring about. Recently, I found out he has been lying to me about one of his ex. He was cheated by this woman many times but still loves her the most as he thinks he cannot find someone understanding better than her. This guy told me he no longer talk to his ex as she cheated and hurt him many times. But I figured out he still texts and hang out with that woman. When I ask if he is flirting with any woman now, he always says No. 


My confusion is I’m not sure why he lies to me about this if he truly considers me as a fwb only. And should I tell him that I already know about all his lies and I cannot accept his behaviors? I tried to ask many open question to give him hints that I know about his lies. But everytime, he always try to cover and re-confirm with me that he will never see his ex again.

Our relationship was perfect: we did everything together, never got sick of each other, loved each other to the fullest, and gave our relationship our all. We rarely fought, and when we did, we would handle it very maturely by talking it out and giving each other space and what not. We grew so much together and individually and learned so much about ourselves during our 2 year relationship. When it was time to go off to college, we went to different schools across the state. Our relationship worked because I was still at home doing online learning, while she moved in to a very busy schedule and campus life. We did long distance for a whole year, which wasn't ideal but it was always ok since I was still at home and could talk/facetime whenever we wanted thanks to online learning. 

This most recent Fall quarter of 2021 was different because now it was my turn to move into the college life, in addition to her schedule getting exponentially busier.  As the quarter went on, it got to a point where we were just sort of ""passing by"" each other through text and didn't get to FaceTime all that much. We both started to feel like our relationship wasn't much of a relationship at that point anymore, but neither of us had lost any feelings for each other at all. We just sort of knew that the best and most mature thing to do was to have a clean break up before things turned sour or before we lost feelings and give each other space to continue our hectic schedules and explore more of college. 

I finished off the quarter feeling a little sting that she was no longer in my life, but it ultimately wasn't too bad since I had so many distractions to keep my head occupied. Right now, it's winter break and I haven't stopped thinking about her at all. Since the breakup, we hadn't talked to each other at all until Christmas when she wished me a Merry Christmas and I did the same back. On New Year's Eve, she asked to drop some stuff off and to see me. We both admitted that we still missed each other A LOT and that we still want to be together and have feelings for each other, but we know that our schedules are only going to get busier. We ended our talk saying that we'll make it through until Spring Break or until school is over for the year and reconvene and see how we're feeling about us, but ultimately focus on ourselves until then.

Since our talk, I got COVID so I have nothing else to do but sit here and reminisce on our relationship or think about our talk or think about our future together or wanting to text her and I'm just losing my damn mind over here lol. 

So my question here is what should I do? Do I say fuck it and give into my emotions and give our relationship another shot or do I follow through with what we said and wait until spring break/summer to see how we feel? Or do I not do either of those and just tuck my feelings for her away and let ""if it's meant to be, it's meant to be"" take the wheel and let our paths cross after college and focus on myself?

Idk if any of this even makes sense, maybe I'm just going insane because I'm quarantined with nothing to do and being at home reminds me of her. Maybe all I need is to get back into my college routine with distractions so I naturally wouldn't think about her. All I know is that she means the world to me and no other girl that I've met at college compares to her and I really don't want to mess anything up with her so please help!!!",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1149017,public,self,Help With an Ex,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rx6doq/help_with_an_ex/,no_ads,0,,,
