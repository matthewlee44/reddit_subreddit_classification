Attraction is a big one. It keeps my sex drive high, this is not necessarily physical but I have to be attracted to voice/face, I like someone open minded who cares about themselves and is interested in growing and looking deeply into things, and the obvious ones are just funny, intelligent, and empathic - I want to be challenged and I don’t want to settle. Also sex, just openness and generosity. I am interested really in long term relationships and am frankly bored of short lived things. I enjoy my own energy and just would love to feel connected and interested in someone. I worry about settling. There is no “the one” it’s just compatibility and aligning.

It just makes you look unambitious and immature. Like people who say someone has to be ""born with it"" as if that gives them a pass on even trying.

I tried not to be a dick about it either- but she wasn't having it and unmatched me.

I met her through work in february through work and what started off as just a bit of fun with talking on the phone slowly evolved into a really strong connection, we meet for the first time 30 march and after the second date we spoke out to eachother that we like eachother. I always have a hard time opening up but she did not mind and was willing to wait, two weeks later i slept at her place and we slept together. Until that point everything was great between us until a week later she said she does not know if it just friendly between us or romantic. I told her it would be hard for me as i do have those romantic feelings, She just had some doubts about it, some moments she did had attraction towards me and sometimes she did not.

As time progressed we remained friends, still talking on the phone everyday, telling eachother everything going on in our lives and she frequently said things like she is really happy that she has me in her life and that she needs me. But as time progressed it also was harder for me at times. Especially if she was hanging out alone with her guy "" friends"".

I was feeling jealous and really questioning my own self worth/ respect at times. I know i just should have go NC the moment she friendzoned me, but yeah stupid me.

Then i made a stupid mistake that broke her trust.. She works at a shop and i needed work and she set me up for a job at the same company ( but at another location) i really hated the job and decided to just leave. The big mistake that i made was that i did not tell her i left and she heart it from the manager of the store instead of me, resulting in her getting really angry. Saying she never should have trusted me and that she is sad she heart it from someone else. I made a proper apology saying i should have told her sooner and that i take full responsibilty for my mistake and it wont happen again. But after this incident the situation changed

She became more distant and i was really missing her, i told her that but she said she does not want to put the effort in anymore after what happened Anyway 3 weeks ago she send me a messages that she really misses me and did not thought our bond would ""break"" this quickly. I told her i miss her aswell but from the moment she told me she just wants to be friends a lot had changed because i really thought we were building something more then just friends. she did not respons on my reaction.

I got a snapchat from her last week from her that she was taking a drive with her ex, which she always complained about to me and talked alot about when we were ""dating"" in hindsight it maybe meant she was not over him still.

14,plx3f8,1631320107,Is he really into me? Does he really like me? Should I let him go?,"Not sure where to begin. It’s a long story. We’ve been seeing each other for about 4 months. Things have been good. Sometimes things get awkward and rough. But most of the times we feel the compatibility. He said he likes me. And then after sometime I told him that I like him. After my confession, his attempts on approaching, getting to know, and spending time with me have become more frequent.


He’s a sweet guy, gentleman, sensitive, smart, and a mix of maturity and childishness. He’s very good on bed. Never force when I’m not in the mood. He always make sure I’m done first before him. What a man, right?

Problem is, after 3 months… I begin to realize many things about him that I’m not sure I’m okay with. I have communicated this to him, but I don’t really get a response yet because he’s been busier with work and the school. He’s an adult (FYI), not some young adult at school. Let’s say older than 30 and our age difference is about 4 years.

So, things I realize about him are:
- He’s not into commitment. I know this because I told him about my intention in dating, that is looking for a husband.
- He’s very good at promising little things but some are forgotten by him and never been done. For example, when he promised me to text me or respond to my text, I waited from hours to a day, never got my text.
- He is not very good at multitasking between his school, work, and dating me.
- His cleaning lifestyle is very different to mine. I’m a very organized and clean person. He’s not.
- He’s only there for me when we want to hang out. He never really there for me when I need him.
- He’s not good at acknowledging he’s wrong at something and apologizing.

But of all the bad things I found out about him, he still has many good things. He integrates me into his circle of friends by inviting me to hangout. He introduced me to his dad. Which I appreciate because at least he didn’t let me be a girl who he secretly dates.

Last time, he texted me saying how he respects me much, not seeing anyone else, and liking me lots. I responded the same energy and words to his confession. However, after that, he began to be busy again, longer duration of text response, making me wait in anxiety.

You see? I feel like I’m happy when I get news from him or when I hangout with him. But he’s also torturing me, without he realize it, that I suffer when I’m not in contact with him.

He said that we are in an adult dating situation. Or he called it relationship when I don’t think it’s relationship if he does not give a title as boyfriend girlfriend. He said adults have to be independent and self sufficient. But what I’ve been asking him is the bare minimum. I only ask for his consistency in communication. I only ask him to be able to manage time.

My doubts becoming huge because I started to question whether he is really into
Me the way he said? Or am I just being fooled by his good sides? I don’t know please help me with some clarity.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/plx3f8/is_he_really_into_me_does_he_really_like_me/

20,plxm50,1631322176,Boyfriend slept with ex while we were broken up,"Boyfriend still have feelings for his ex?

My (27F) boyfriend (29M) and I technically started dating in March 2020 but broke up in May 2020 for one month. The first few months we dated, I always felt like something was off. Like one foot was out the door the whole time for him. When we broke up, I found out via social media that he hung out with his ex the weekend after he broke it off with me. I always felt like he still had feelings for her.  They were engaged (dated for 4 years) and had broken up in 2016 so it had been awhile. She cheated on him several times while they were dating snd it was an overall very unhealthy relationship which I do believe my boyfriend probably played a role in.

We ended up reconnecting in June 2020 and I gave it another shot but told him how I know he hung out with his ex the weekend we broke up and wanted to talk about it. He denied it and told me I was crazy. Finally a month ago he admitted it. She stayed with him for 3 days, and they slept together and went out a couple times etc. Even though we were broken up, it still hurt to hear it from him. And to think of all the times I asked about it and he just told me how crazy I was when I was literally 100% correct about everything. It makes me wonder about all the other times I brought up concerns and he just shut down and said I am crazy or psycho. He is more emotionally invested now than before, but it wasn’t until I got a promotion in a new state and almost broke up with him 6 months ago that he “realized he was in love with me and that I was his soul mate”. I still struggle to this day thinking I am just his second option since his ex is now dating someone new. I can’t seem to believe him when he tells me I am his soul mate and how much he loves me. He has never been super complimentary towards me and is really only affectionate when he is drunk. I don’t know. Am I crazy for still thinking he has feelings for his ex?

I believe I am a decent looking man, though I am exercising to lose some body weight. I know there are plenty of dating apps online and was wondering for advice on which app I should try, as well as tips on how to approach women. It seems sending them a like or a hello isn't receiving any replies for conversations when I do get matches. 

For context, I have been using Facebook dating mostly. It is a pain 😅 even when I do get matches, they don't respond. Been this way for a week now, sigh. 

Another few apps I have tried are Tinder and uHinge. Tinder seems to have some pretty confident and attractive women, like models almost, and I doubt they are looking for a guy like me. I'm not quite at that league yet (working on it though!) and for now am searching for more casual women. By casual, I don't mean sleeping around or hook ups 😆 I meant women who are trying to find a good partner, not a good lay. 

uHinge is new to me and was recommended by a redditor the other day, but apparently there are limits to how many likes you can send unless you pay for a subs which is a bummer. Any good dating apps you guys recommend? Preferably not for hookups. 

Also how should I introduce myself when I do get matches? I get a simple hello is boring, but I don't really introduce myself to strangers with a knock knock joke either haha!

I was wearing an Avril shirt and the 2 girls around me were massive fans as well and they were going crazy. I filmed the entire appearance and so did the two girls.

I took a picture with her and then I left. I texted her later that night with my name and the picture of us so she'd know who I was. She said Hey and then immediately asked for the video. I ended up sending it to her Snapchat cause I was having trouble sending it via SMS. She thanked me and it seemed like that was it.

I’ve been ghosted by 3 different girls for whom I’ve had considerable interest in the last 5 months, and I feel so stupid and inadequate every time. It affects me heavily because I get no closure and am left to guess for myself. Maybe I did something wrong, maybe I didn’t—who knows?

Ghosting is immature and I’ve never done it to anyone, especially romantic interests. Knowing my impatience, I’ll probably end up confronting this girl, getting left on read, and beating myself up for it. But why can’t we just avoid these things in the first place? Why can’t people just communicate and be transparent? We’re adults, not children.

We kept hanging out for a while but I stopped talking to him and started seeing another guy because I didn’t think he was the type for something serious. However, he got upset and eventually confessed he had feelings for me and shortly after asked me to be his girlfriend. I liked him, but I was really surprised. Still I said yes. Our relationship was good, until he had to move out of state for work the next year. I assumed that would be the end of it, but he kept saying how I needed to come visit him “every weekend.” I said I would visit him if he really wanted me to, and thought this meant he took me seriously. When he moved, he would hit me up constantly saying he missed me, asking me when I was coming to visit. Then I finally go there (paid for by me, he offered though) and it’s like everything I did was wrong. He refused to spend any time with me. He didn’t want to sleep with me. I had no car and no food  and not enough money to order a week’s worth of takeout food to his house. His roommate ended up feeling bad for me and I spent the week with him and his friends instead. He told me how my ex had had countless girls over and openly made fun of me. At one point I was crying and my ex just started screaming at me. I had to sleep in his bed with him and he wouldn’t even look at me. I went home. We didn’t talk for a long time. Finally he told me that he didn’t like me and never did, and said he was sorry because he knew how bad it hurt to like someone who didn’t like you back.

The thing is that I just met a guy (20) that I really like, he is nice, polite and sweet. For a little context we met at a disco and have a lot of friends in common, i liked him instantly but he was so shy (towards me, not in general) that i was not sure if he liked me. I am gonna be clear, i am pretty straight up girl, if i like you i will ask for your number or anything but if that wasnt the case, we would never have talked again bc i wouldnt really know if he likes me

I mean, if you are in a disco and see a girl that you like (more if she is in your group of friends just get closer to her) (where i am is not common to verbally ask someone to dance) 

Everything went okay and i saw him the next weekend (we really clicked during the week) but he was kind of ignoring me and i know that he is atracted to me is just that i know that when you are in your earlys 20s is kind of hard to approach to someone

The thing is that we are not longer talking bc i am not used to that you know? I can do the first approach once bc i inow how hard men have it and are always expected ti do it but i cannot see him every weekend and getting ignored while we talk all week

So long story short he lost the oportunity bc of his shyness don’t let it to pass to you too

46,pm0dgb,1631333280,How to pursue a relationship with aspergers?,"I'm a 25 year old guy and I was diagnosed with aspergers as a kid. I grew up poor (like living below the poverty line) and was pretty severely bullied at school.

&amp;#x200B;

I dropped out of high school and taught myself for 4 years, I did pretty well at it and got a scholarship to college and law school. I lived at home during college and commuted there so didn't have much of a social life. I did well at college and law school and graduated summa cum laude in both degrees. After a lot of trouble in job interviews I finally landed a good job and have gone from poverty to being materially comfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

I had always kind of assumed that, having grown up poor that money would solve all of my life problems. It's solved a lot of them tbh, renting my own apartment instead of living at home is quite nice, as is not having to count pennies all the time, but one problem remains:  I've never had sex. I've never really tried either thinking I was too ugly and weird to have a chance.

&amp;#x200B;

I started on the apps a few months back at the behest of a drunk girl friend from work. Got a few matches but nothing really happened on tinder or bumble - I got some good matches but no real convos happening. On hinge I did better for some reason and have had quite a few matches and have gone out on dates with 4 different women. The first woman was quite cute and I went out on four dates with her and had my first kiss with (she initiated a french kiss with me after the fourth and final date). She ended up breaking up with me saying she wasn't ready for a relationship and things were moving too quickly. I didn't gel with the next two girls. The fourth one I quite liked (she was very attractive which helped) but she sent me back a message a few days later wishing me the best on hinge but saying we just ""didn't vibe"".

54,pm0rf8,1631334987,Fiancé left me a day before we were suppose to elope &amp; I need help before I o** myself.,"Let me start off by saying. I 23, am a pretty attractive female, although this would be this first I’m admitting such a weird thing in context to the situation. On my good days, I’m a 9. On my bad, a 7. So a year ago in Oct 2020 I started talking to this guy, 22. that was in and out of this absurd toxic 5 year reletionship. A reletionship in which he was cheated on multiple times and his gf of 5 years decided to stop seeing him the last 3 years of their “reletionship” yes. You heard that right. 3 years never seeing eachother even though they live 30 minutes away from eachother. He had seen her before so she isn’t a cat fish. He also has been asking her to marry him within this 5 years and she says yes but then comes up with reasons why they need to postpone. I know, weird. So i started talking to him in between this time and was so utterly confused and dumb founded by their relationship like most are, I tried to support him and see him as someone who’s been abused by her and pitted him. Yet, he would break up with her. Talk to me and then when he found out either that she cheated on him again, or said some really harsh nasty things about him he would get her back. Obviously I thought he was crazy and lost touch after abt a month of talking.. later on in January we got in touch again and the story was the same, “he’s suppose to get married within the next few days” and days would go by she would call it off so again, I backed away. But again, in July. After I was guilt tripped by some mutual friends of ours telling me that I’m too stuck up and should give him a chance.  We once again started talking. Long story short. He broke up with the toxic gf and we started dating in august. One thing to keep in mind. I told him before that I had this feeling he was someone that likes being treated like shit, he liked being cheated on and that it turns him on bc I’ve never heard in my life for someone to go back to someone who cheated after breaking up and staying with someone who won’t see you in 3 years. He assured me the only reason he stood was bc he had no other options. The reason I brought up my looks was bc this kid, was probably a 2 out of 10. He lied about his height and was probably only 5”4/5”5 did not take care of himself and had horrible teeth but I convinced myself that the high value 10/10 men I’ve been dating never worked and maybe a unattractive lovable loser would be perfect for me. And at this point I fell for his personality. Things were going great. He was so sweet to me and made me really happy, of course they’re were little signs I should’ve noticed like. Both his parents died, leaving him orphan living with his grandmother but he told me stories of how his dad once caught him making a MySpace acc when he was 9 so his dad beat him and then tied him up to a chair under the kitchen dining table and was forced to eat and sleep there &amp; if he tried getting up he got a beating. He also told me about his brother being 7 asked for an ice cream and his father beat him so badly bc of it, there was bruises all over him that his teacher noticed and called CPS which is why they had to run from Denver to California. Although, I should’ve stopped to think about the possible violent mental illness his dad may have not only passed on genetically but may have created in him through the trauma he caused. But of course little ol’ me only thought about how I need to love him harder and better than anyone because he truly has never experienced one single person that cares for him. His two ex’s both cheated on him. Daddy tortured him and mom did nothing to stop him, and his grandmother never cared for him.. if you’ve gotten this far I promise you. me explaining that will have a purpose in the end. Things with us were moving fast. He already started mentioning marriage 2 days after it being official and I was okay with it. He told me now in September that he wanted to be married before Halloween so we could spend holidays together &amp; he doesn’t have to be alone on his bday. (Side note, as Romanian ppl it is completely normal for things to go this fast, couples don’t talk longer than a few months before getting married) he also told me he loved me first. Somethings ended up coming up and I called him asking him if he was sure he was in love with me and if things are going to fast to tell me and we’ll slow it down. He said he was sure and he was happy how fast things are going so I said cool instead of waiting for oct 1st to come around why don’t u just pick me up at the end of the week on the 9th. He agreed happily and even suggested we just do it that night instead of waiting the week but I objected. Comes September 8 one day before we were supposed to elope. He gets a IG DM From his ex with a passcode to an account he was trying to sign into that was still linked to her email. He responded to her a few times and then ended their conversation with thank you. It bothered me because he never once stopped to think about how that may have made me feel. You could’ve just asked me if it was OK to get the code from her I would’ve said yes. I was bummed out because this is now the third time he showed me he was willing to hurt me without stopping to think about it for a second. Although bummed and hurt I don’t say anything. That same morning he told me that he. “Can’t wait for these few hours to go by because he can’t wait to be with me, I’m all he’s ever wanted and God truly blessed him with me. Blah blah etc. keep that in mind, so around 7 PM he calls me. We talked  for a little and he notices that I’m not in the best mood and asked me what’s wrong I say nothing and continue going about his day and call me later, he continues to press, “what’s wrong” I tell him nothing Steve I don’t want to argue about it it’s ok call me later. He continues “If theres a problem I need for you to tell me so we could fix the problem, was it about those text today?” And I continue on “Well, if  I would’ve talk to my ex-boyfriend how would you have felt?” Then, he snaps. Immediately start screaming cursing yelling that he did nothing wrong and I’m getting on his nerves of course this goes back-and-forth between us for a little I have yet still though to make it personal or attack him personally all I did was talk about the problem at hand but he still continue to push and scream and yell even though he was the one who pressured me in to telling him what was wrong just to set me up and he could argue with me. I tried to explain to him we only have 24 hours left until we’re married and I’m worried that’s somethings going to happen that makes me lose him and I don’t wanna lose him so I suggested me and him getting some space for the night and I will call him tomorrow when I am ready for him to pick me up he proceeds to get angry and says “you think I’m gonna go tonight without talking to you? That isn’t how this works” while I was trying to explain that I just don’t want to argue he hangs up on my face and says he’ll call me later. 20 minutes later I get a text message consisting some thing like
“ i’m gonna be real honest with you I don’t like this anymore and I don’t like you you’re a snap case and I just left one snap case I honestly try to give you the benefit of The doubt and try to understand your logic and reasoning but you snapped on me for no reason and regardless you’re rushing this way too much it’s going way too fast i want nothing to do with you anymore I changed my Instagram password and I blocked you. Now i’ll show you what a real dick is like” … this all again coming from the same coward who earlier that morning told me he can’t wait to get through these next few hours to spend the rest of his life with me and that he’s so blessed to have me And so excited to be with me. He wasn’t even man enough to put a phone call he blocked me on everything and refused to answer any one of my phone calls or respond to one text message but, The ex girlfriend who cheated on him for five years who cheated on him two days after his mother died and who refuses to get anywhere near him since the last three years got a text message so kindly that said “ i’m so sorry to have to do this to you I’m so sorry It didn’t work out but I found somebody else and I’m sorry that it happens like this”. After all this happened I felt like I was in a fever dream putting all the pieces together. He put on such a good mask I cannot blame myself for not being able to see it but the reason I bring up how abusive the father was is because after seeing the way he snapped and so easily tortured somebody emotionally, the only one person that ever cared about him truly, my question is, is it possible that there are some people that just don’t know how to be loved. Who have only ever known abuse and miss treatment and when shown love and respect for the first time in their lives it’s foreign an uncomfortable to them so they abuse it the way they were. It’s so embarrassing at this point because I wasn’t even attracted to him but I thought he was a good person so I ignored it for some ugly loser who returned my kindness and love for emotional abuse and disrespect. I just wanna know your guys opinion, was it a psychological problem with him? Can he really resent being loved properly? Will he regret it and try to come back? Please help.

I'm so tired of dating apps because I've been on them for so long but nothing ever comes out of it. I easily get 50+ guys like me on Hinge within an hour, but none of them seem to standout to me or can show me their personality. ""Tacos, margs, sports and the office"" doesn't tell me much about them so I don't even get matches. I've been on them for so long that I am seeing the same guys even though I blocked them months ago.

I miss going out on dates or having a small group or 1:1 friend hangouts. Even making friends is hard as well. &gt;&lt; Hope I'm not the only one struggling with friendships and relationships.

""Within the 17-page document, Wright outlined all of her expectations for their relationship, which asked Head for no silent treatment, TO PAY FOR DATE NIGHTS and to not isolate her from her loved ones.""

Wouldn't this be prostitution or a form of it at least? If he is always paying for dates and they are having sex, isn't he just paying her for sex and companionship by buying her dinner and gifts? She NEVER pays. It's right there in the contract. I mean, he's a sap for signing it but isn't this just legalized prostitution?

I thought dating was supposed to be about 2 people getting to know each other that have MUTUAL interest. This seems like she is just looking for a free ride and wanted to make it legal so once he realizes it, he can't get out of it.

If this isn't legalized prostitution, what is it because it sure seems one sided to me and the guy is taking all the risk. Why can't she pay her half or pay every other time? Isn't that fair?

60,pm14zn,1631336690,If a guy currently doesn't have a job is that a turnoff?,"So for context, I'm a 20-year-old guy who lost his job a few months back. I'm also just starting my last semester of college. I was VERY fortunate enough to have enough money saved for my last semester, and enough money to live on till I'm done with school. This is due to me being able to save as much as I could while working and also the fact that I live with my parents. So like I said before I am very fortunate to be in my situation.  This also means that I don't plan on really getting a job before December when I graduate. (Unless a great opportunity comes up or something) I just wanna finish my undergraduate degree on a strong note and be able to focus a little more on my studies. 

Now that classes are back to being in-person I am able to meet a lot of people. So I'm kinda down with the idea of me putting myself out there again!  And out of all the worries to have about trying to meet people and start dating, this is the one that bugs me the most for some reason. It might be a silly worry to have but I've always worked, gone to school, and had myself together like that. So the question being would this be a turnoff or a reflag for you? While meeting people for the next few months I don't want to be seen as lazy or that I don't have anything going for me ya know.

61,pm1b7q,1631337471,did I fuck up or is this just my inner critic at its worst?,"So I usually go out to the park during my lunch break and I did the same last week. Was just lying there when I saw my work crush sitting there at the park bench eating his lunch. I am an over thinker so after 10 minutes of contemplating whether to approach him or run for my life, I decided I'm going to give it a shot and just ask him out. This is a big deal for me and I could feel myself grow mentally as I walked.  

I didn't ask him out but we talked about how shit dating is in this 'hookup culture' and how its so hard to trust people and that romance is dead. He makes music and I asked him to play it for me.. and he did. I confessed that I tried to stalk him on social media and that didn't seem to bother him (or he didn't show if it did bother him). I'm pretty sure he could tell how much I liked him.. I couldn't tell if he was into me or was just being friendly. We walked back to the office together and we both said we were glad that I walked up to him and said 'hi'.

Anyway, the next day, a few of us at work were gonna go out for lunch so I emailed him something along the lines of ""hope to see you there"" to which he responded that he couldn't as he brought lunch from home and had to run an errand during the break. He did say that he'd come around next time and that he'd like to hang out again soon. To which I responded ""100% - let me know when"" AND that ""if you don't mind, could you please send through some of your music, I'd love to hear it properly"" . He did not respond to this which made me wonder If I came on too strong.

Hence the question - Did I come on too strong or what? 

I know if something like that scared him off, it probably wasn't gonna go anywhere in the future. So I probably did the right thing and am just over analyzing everything because my inner critic gets off on the slightest indication of rejection.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pm1b7q/did_i_fuck_up_or_is_this_just_my_inner_critic_at/

So now shes moved back but she also brought her bf with her which at first i didnt care about because it wasn’t blatant and she was thousand of miles away but now that shes back I want my girl back.

They were iffy about it and I can see where their coming from but I really just want to spend time with my girlfriend because I really like her.

I recently slept over my girlfriends house and my parents knew this. I spent 3 days there and we slept in the same bed. Her parents were completely fine with this and they treated me like family. My parents didn’t actually know that we slept in the same bed until I mentioned it when they said she could sleep in our guest bedroom. When I said we slept in the same bed they got super surprised and my dad said “I want playing all my cards” by asking for her to sleep over. Obviously I know that he’s implying I want her to stay so we can have sex. This is not the case. We both have physical touch as our love language and we really just love spending time together. The three days I stayed at her houses were amazing. 

I respect my parents, I always have. I’m a good kid I like to think. In university studying medicine, great grades, never done drugs or drank. I told them if they weren’t comfortable with it then she wouldn’t spend the night but then they said okay reluctantly for staying in the same bed but I’m getting the feeling they’re only saying that because I slept at her house. 

My parents said that when they were younger they never had sleepover, let alone In the same bed but my parents got pregnant at a younger age then me while they still lived with their parents and got married at my age.

I told him I'm only wanting something serious and he agreed to it and even told me straight up, ""If im seeing you i won't be dating anyone else, are you going to do the same?"" And I told him ""yes, I don't believe in dating multiple people at the same time.""

We matched on tinder recently, and I guess when he messaged me he was looking more for a client to do photoshoots since he's new in the country but I told him I wasn't really into doing photoshoots but we continued to chat and eventually we kept talking. We had a few phone calls and met up yesterday. He would like to see me again. Overall I think he's a great guy and hasn't displayed any issues to me at all.

But what is slightly worrying is the fact that he follows a lot of women (mostly on his business and quite a few on his personal page). A lot of the women are from back home in his country but I noticed a lot are from our city. 

Now, I know he was dating before me and so was I. I was actually talking to someone a few days prior but cut him off. And we talked about our previous relationships and dates so I have no issue with that. But now I'm slightly worried that he might be using tinder still (maybe not to hook up or date girls) but the girls may get the wrong idea about it and actually want to go out or hook up with him. I haven't talked to him about this yet as I don't want to come off as the jealous psycho but I did have an ex cheat and lie to me so many times in the past so I only want to be vigilant before things get really serious.

89,pm489x,1631352037,"Starting a relationship could be hard and full of challenges, but am I (26M) out of options here ? (29F)","**TLDR;**

I (26M) loves a girl (29F) who is very smart, kind and pretty. It's extremly hard to find someone like that, so i don't want to really give up unless it's really a doomed relationship from the start.

She had one real bf before me, who she lost her virginity to. The problem is, I (virgin) did live with her and her bf in the same house back in the uni. I can't get the thought of them together outside of my head. Knowing that she was sleeping with someone else and lost her virginity just few meters away from me, is killing me. (and I am already self-conscious like hell).  
We both wanted to have long term relationships that lead to marriage. Her ex promised her he would marry her, etc. and then dumbed her when he was done. The thing is, the thought it self is hard to swallow, knowing that the someone you love most and would spend the rest of your life with, was being fucked just few meters next to you is hard.

When I am with her, I mostly don't have negative thoughts, and I enjoy my time with her. The problem is that when i get back home, especially at night, these thought haunts me. I even dreamt of it twice or so ...

This is doomed from the start, or is there a way around it ? If we moved forward with this relationship, will things get better or worse ? I know the safe answer that most would give is to move on, but I honestly don't want to give up on her.

91,pm4clm,1631352677,I’m into this girl,"Alright so I met this girl. When I first met her she was kinda seeing this guy. But recently we have been hanging out, it’s always been “as friends” but might there be More?

She has stated to me that we have a “vibe” whatever that means. I haven’t dated in a while. We are both in our early 30s. She sends me memes and we flirt. She has a nickname for me, she’s always asking to have lunch or go have some drinks. She invites me over to hang all the time. We do things all the time. I am very much into her but don’t know if she’s into me as I’m very bad with signs and haven’t dated in years. Should I just let it flow and see where it leads or should I make a move? Someone please help",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pm4clm/im_into_this_girl/
