Guy 1 : he's pretty self aware that what he wants a few years from now cannot be predicted.  So he responsibly is careful not to lead her on with promise of lifelong commitment. 

Guy 2 : he has no self awareness. He wrongly thinks what he wants today, he will continue to want it. He irresponsibly gives the girl high hopes and later backs out / breaks up. Maybe he starts getting bored in relationship,  or falls out of love  or the girl gains weight and he no longer feels attraction to her, etc.

Guy 3 : he is an even worse version of previous guy . He knows very well that he wouldn't want this relationship longer than six months. Yet gives the girl high hopes to make her stay. And then, once he has had a good time and wants to move on to some other partner, he just abruptly makes up an excuse and breaks up. Or worse, he gives the girl some inferiority complex, making her feel as if she was the one at fault.

Now,  each of them was having a nice time with their partner but guy 1 decided  to sacrifice it for sake of love for his partner  by being honest. While guy 2 hurt both himself and his loved one by not being far sighted. While guy 3 was very shrewd and selfish and thought only of his pleasure. He knew the outcome beforehand yet chose to keep his intentions hidden from his partner.

And most women don't like a confused guy like guy 1 when in reality,  he is the most honest and truly loves her to save her from getting emotionally hurt.

Most women either would want the spontaneous unworried about future guy2 or the guy3 who gives them a false sense of security and serious commitment. 

So, what should guy 1 do to protect his interests yet not do any unethical action that his conscience disallows?

After my last relationship ended, I've started looking to get away from app dating as it just sucks my soul. Plus it's getting expensive! Bumble is like $30/month now and I just don't care enough to pay for it.   
So how else do you find partners? Well, the short answer is everywhere. And here is what I've learned:   
\- You can meet women almost anywhere   
\- Meeting women off of dating apps is much more rewarding both mentally and emotionally as the success rate is higher   
\- Learning how to use different mediums, apps, and methods of communication increases your overall conversation abilities   
\- In my opinion, people my age demographic (late 20s) are just as fed up with dating as I am   
\- Being out and about just leads you to meeting more people  
\- If you can be clean, have generally interesting conversation, shave and not be an ass, you'll have much better success than you will app dating   
**- The competition in real life is much lower**  
**Again, THE COMPETITION IN REAL LIFE IS MUCH LOWER!!**  
What I've found is that, on average, people are bad at talking to people. For whatever reason, and I don't mean to rag on men as I am one, but men are generally bad at talking, even politely, to women in real life. So, this means that if you are able to strike up a conversation with a woman, you'll have much better odds in real life of actually getting a phone number and a date than you will spending hours swiping on dating apps.   
The thing about dating with apps is that if you have a few pictures from a few years ago that are good, you can keep using them. After all, people only see what you show them. So, for all of us who gained the covid weight, we can still use our beautiful selves from 2020 to strike up matches. The downside, is that you don't have much motivation too actually be a healthy, confident and attractive man as almost all of the interaction is online and, if you don't have much luck on the apps, you never really go out and meet these women.   
However, when you are meeting women in public, there is a lot more motivation to lose that cover weight, shave today, comb your hair and put on pants that don't smell.   
To sum, try meeting people in real life. It's probably better for your mental health, you'll have more success and it'll give you something social to do.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1127733,public,self,Not using dating apps to meet women,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qxav0x/not_using_dating_apps_to_meet_women/,no_ads,0.0,,,

I’d just like to preface this by saying that I’m in university, and I’ve never had experience dating or with girls. I’ve also been a lurker on this sub, so my perceptions could be greatly skewed compared to how dating actually works to which I will take it on the chin.

There’s this one girl in class who I’ve taken a liking to. Initially, we started off talking as we were paired within a group for class, and now a few months later, she refers to us as friends. I’ve always thought she was cute, but I’ve never really wanted to act upon it because I felt it’d be rude to pursue anything as we were just friends. However, she’s been saying things like how we should hangout or how she attended class because I was going to be there or else she would have skipped. She also frequently notices and waves at me when we cross paths. These signs aren’t glaringly obvious that she likes me compared to the more obvious ones that I’ve read on here, and I do also realize that she could just be friendly as every girl is different. As for some more context, we’re not in the same friend group, so I’d imagine that if we were to hangout it’d be on a one-on-one setting.

We’re friends within class, but we haven’t hung outside of class, and I’ve been told by friends and online sources that it’d be much easier to first become friends with a girl to which you could then potentially pursue a relationship, so I am currently going along with this route. I ended up asking her if she wanted to grab some food to which she said she wanted to ask me the same thing and sounded excited. I’d just like to make it clear that this wasn’t a date by any means. And so I thought this was another good sign, but it turned out afterwards she was with her friends yet reassured she would still be available. I messaged her at the planned time if she was ready, but she said that she was still with friends and that she thought she had told me. I was clearly not notified. She planned for a different day to which I agreed.

I’m already a little nervous putting myself out there as this is my first time in uncharted territories, and I don’t want to come off as desperate, so I’m not sure if I should reach out again to see if our plans are still on. Is it reasonable to say that if she doesn’t message me on the rescheduled day that she doesn’t care? If this happens should I just move on and stick to just being friends? Or maybe is being out with friends a legitimate reason as to why she didn’t notify me and make it? Lastly, I do want to note that I understand she does not owe me anything, but I’m still curious on my end.

I’d appreciate any feedback. Thank you in advance.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1127738,public,self,What should I [18M] be expecting from this girl?

More of a vent, but would really appreciate your outside perspectives on my situation before I drive myself totally bananas, lol.

Back in August, I went on OLD open to meeting people, making friends/connections in my new city. So I (25M) started talking to this guy (27M) at the beginning of September. Initially great, having some good conversations. I ask early on if they'd like to meet IRL for a walk (I don't enjoy endless texting - *which.. just wait* \- so I always try to meet ASAP). He agrees, we go on the walk - again, good conversation, felt comfortable, just overall a nice time. We expressed mutual interest in getting together again. 

Now, on this walk I asked what he was looking for. I didn't really get a clear answer, but a couple days later while we're chatting I get: ""Hey, just want to let you know I'm not looking for anything serious/dating. I really like hanging out with you though."" Okay, maybe a bit disappointed, but I was okay making amical connections and I appreciated the honesty. Honestly, if he just wanted to hookup I'd be open to that too. So I suggest grabbing a beer as friends, which he happily agrees to &amp; we pick a date. The day comes, he cancels hours before because of work. That's ok, things happen. I ask if he's free the following weekend: ""sure""! That weekend comes along, I barely hear from him and then late Sunday he tells me he was having a bad weekend. Again, stuff happens, I understand. But this is where I should've probably bowed out...

On multiple other occasions I suggest we meet up or go for a quick walk or what have you (he lives 5 minutes away from me, it shouldn't be that hard). Never really commits to anything but expresses interest. At this point I'm a bit confused, but he seems interested, right? So here I carry along with the endless snapping. 

By October, I'm really starting to feel confused and anxious. He starts giving me hot/cold signals via Snapchat (main communication, even though he could text me). Generally some red flags start to surface that I naively ignore. At this point.. I just feel bloody confused and unsure.

Fast forward, one night I get a snap of a hickey... uhm, ok a little weird to show me. Then he's complaining about how he doesn't have time for boys blah blah (so you have time to go get a hickey, but not a 20 min. walk?). So I ask: ""If you don't have time for boys, why are you on Grindr and such then?"" No passiveness in that question, just genuinely curious. Crickets. Ok, sorry didn't mean to put you on the spot. Him: ""you sound like my therapist."" Me: ??. Like, that should be a pretty simple thing to answer, idk.

Last week he reaches out to set up a time to meet. We agree on a day. Day comes, I touch base with him- ""sorry can't. Work came up. I feel like an asshole but I do want to hang with you *soon* :) ). Just friggin' peeved at this point. I also woke up earlier while working nights to be able to hang during daylight hrs.

At risk of continuing this ramble, he still interacts with me daily but I feel like I'm checking out and I just feel wildly confused. Like, this isn't my first rodeo but damn.. why even interact if you have no intentions of hanging out? Wt\* is going on here?? And better yet why am I still here. I'm less responsive to him at this point, but I haven't been able to let it go. I'm not one to ghost but it's really tempting. Should I? I think the fact that he's not overtly mean or anything is making this hard.

Thanks for making it this far. What do you think is happening? What do you think is the best approach at this point? I'm honestly so embarrassed and frustrated - I feel like I've been terribly naïve and just plain stupid with this. I've had my share of bad dating/whatever experiences, but this is driving me mental. Please virtually slap me, lol.

That is all. Thanks friends :)

I waited a year to get over this, she was my childhood friend and I never thought she would do this to me. I thought I would have healed but that wasn't true, so after a year of the breakup I dated again using Bumble a girl I would travel 2h by car to see. This was 3 years ago.

 She was immature and she liked me only for 3 months, after which she discarded and devalued me. I was in so much pain because I was intent on making it work for ever. She wasn't. She deceived me. She forced me to be the man in the relationship. She mocked me for being a woman. 

My younger cousin also has been using the app to enable her extreme promiscuity which is a feature of her borderline diagnosis. I have loved and supported her but when I was broken I could no longer overlook thaf she was looking down on me for not hooking up with strangers in public toilets like she does instead of realizing she is self trashing doing things like such. She dumped our lifelong friendship for her s*x addiction and ego.

Whenever I am on Bumble or other app I feel discouraged. I am holding out on love for years and focusing on my career which makes me feel deprived of affection and isolated.

They say, healthy relationships are boring. But imagine someone makes you feel comfortable and secure, remembers little tiny details about you including your favorites, and giving you assurance even if you not asked it. Someone you can be vulnerable with, you can be yourself, you can be genuine without disrespecting you. Someone who has clear and vivid plans about your relationship. Someone who respects your time and boundaries and understands that you have other people in your life. Someone who makes time for you, care for you, and sees your flaws as ground for bloom. Someone who never lets you sleep with a heavy heart and never take advantage of you. Someone who communicates their thoughts because they care about your relationship; that disagreements are part of it and wants it healthy. 

Imagine having someone who is good for your heart.

We are blinded by red flags because they are represented by the color of love. We always think that we can change them; that they'll soon realize their mistakes; that they will have initiative to fix themselves. We assume and hope that the love we give will be an enough reason for them to be better. Or otherwise, we want plot twist, we want thrill, we want someone's not boring, we want to play games, that we forgot about peace. We forgot about the love we deserve.

More than likely just paranoid and overthinking but I feel like because it’s been set up by a friend (and he speaks about it a lot) there’s extra pressure for it to go well that there just shouldn’t be on a first date.

I was almost ready to give up on online dating after more than 4 years of having no luck. We matched and hit it off right away. Our interests, world views, personalities and everything just clicked. We had a few video calls before we first met up in person. It was almost 2 weeks before we first met in person as we both had prior commitments/busy schedules, but during those 2 weeks we chatted or video called every chance we got.

For our first date I recommended we do something different from the usual of go for a drink. She is a huge fan of a certain film series, and as we both live only around an hour away from where some of it was filmed, I recommended we go there so she could show me where different parts were filmed. Even though I live only an hour away I had never been there myself as I only moved to this city a few months prior.

We met around midday, and I surprised her by turning up in a jumper that was from her favourite film series. She gave me a warm welcome hug and laughed, and she said she totally digs the jumper and thanked me for the nice surprise.

I then invited her to go grab lunch at a place that has her favourite food on the menu. We walked and talked for a couple hours, getting along so well. She made me laugh with her quick wit and humour, and I vice versa. I could already tell she was every bit as genuine as she was in our video calls and texts. It just felt right, and to be honest the connection we were starting to build here I could already tell was special.

We then proceeded to the main event, whereby she showed me around the filming location and what happened in different scenes and where. I was completely taken back by her knowledge and passion. We sat down on a bench in some gardens and I told her thanks for coming and that I was having a fantastic day so far. She smiled and looked right into my eyes, and then it seemed like the world paused for a moment as I looked back into her eyes with a smile of my own.

I knew this was the moment so I leant it to give her a kiss and she reciprocated. It was an amazing feeling, a true kiss that felt real and with so much intent. As we sat there with our lips against each other it felt like nothing else in the world mattered. It was at this point I knew this could be something special.

The fun on our first date didn't stop there, we then went for hot chocolate and marshmallows. We talked more and by this time it was around 6pm and she had to travel back at this time. I walked her to her car and that is when it finally hit me that this had been the best first date I've ever had. I didn't want it to stop so I proposed an outrageous idea that I would travel back with her in her car if she'd have me, at least that way we'd get another hour together. Her face lit up with excitement, she seemed so happy that I asked this and she jumped at the chance. So off we went for another hour together.

We never stopped talking unless we were kissing or holding hands for a moment. Yes some will say this is crazy for a first date, but we didn't see it that way as we had been chatting/video calling an awful lot prior to this. Also there's no way to explain the instant connection and bond we formed that day, it was simply one of those rare special moments in life.

After we arrived back near her place she dropped me at the train station where we said our goodbyes.

This story is about our first IRL date, but of course things have gone from strength to strength since then and she finally now knows just how I feel about her, and I had almost forgotten what a wonderful feeling this is.

I hope my story can inspire other singles not to lose hope. Good luck to all of you singles currently looking for that special someone, I know the struggles as I spent more than 4 years doing the same. I can now say viola to the dating apps and focus on a new chapter in my life.

One month in I asked him if we were exclusive and he said ""I would hope we are"" (\*Hits forehead\*). Things were going great for a while but then he started hanging out with his female best friend more than me: going out to dinner with her, going to concerts, movies, fun activities and I just learned that they see each other almost every week. I know people can have close friends that are of the opposite sex, I have guy best friends myself, but I have not seen him nor has he taken me on a date for over a month now. Since the last time I saw him he's only offered to spend one night with me and that was so we could spend it having sex (we did not spend the night together). In the time that I have not seen him, I have attempted to plan multiple types of dates, with him, two of them being meals or watching a movie, but he will tell me he's swamped with work or money's tight.

A couple months ago we had an argument over him going on multiple last minute getaways alone with her and not telling me until after they got back. Two weeks ago they went to Vegas alone. This time he did not tell me about their trip to at all, I found out because she posted a picture and tagged him. When I brought it up to him he said they had planned this trip during the Summer but wouldn't say why he didn't tell me about it prior.

I have not met her and he will not tell me anything about her. I know that he's known her longer than me. I asked him if I could meet her and he left me on read for a few days. He ignored my question and texted me about something else. Based on his response, or lack thereof, my thoughts are that she IS his best friend but with benefits, they are dating and I met him when they went through a rough patch, or she is an ex that he can't let go of. He is important to her though, as she has stalked my social media a few times.

I have tried ending things in the past, and voiced that what he is doing disrespectful but he only repeats that she is his best friend. He'll also tell me that he loves me and that I'm toxic because I won't let go fo the past. Either he's a manipulative asshole or an asshole that sees nothing wrong, I think the former.

Should I just cut my losses with him? Of course there's a part of me that still likes the thought of being with him but I'm over being treated like this. I can't end things with him because he won't let me so should I just start dating other guys without telling him? I know that will make me look bad to some people and I would prefer to talk to him but he doesn't want to talk.

I know he won't change anytime soon and I don't want to stick around waiting for him to do so. I've already wasted a lot of time on him.

I thought that when I moved to America, that I would be much more popular and social that I was back in PR. But it’s felt the same, barely any friends or texts. Constantly alone in my dorms even when I have a lot of meetups apps and belong to a group. And a lot of that is because of both covid and my inability to communicate effectively through text. I’m awful at texting, it feels inhuman to me. I can’t read people through a fucking screen, I can’t get their nuances, body language, their tone of voice, their eye contact, all of that etc. And it’s not like I’m awkward or shy or just don’t know how to communicate, it’s just that now our culture has ingrained texting into its main form of communication. I get so depressed seeing people on like discord groups, Facebook, insta, and WhatsApp all have really good communication with eachother, sending memes and keeping in contact for long periods of time. It makes me feel like the years of transforming myself from a very socially inept person into a more charming and likeable,social person went to waste. And that doesn’t even include dating and sex. So I see people constantly complained about how they haven’t gotten laid in x amount of time usually a very short month or two and it makes me feel like what am I doing wrong?! I don’t know how to get casual sex from people neither through apps or real life. I can get dates, make out with them same date. And then nothing. I watched a few posts about how guys miss hints and I felt I never had that problem. But my problem is that I think im just too friendly, and I don’t know (well don’t know completely) what girls do to try and get casual sex or hookups, besides bars and parties obviously. Im honestly stuck between am I socially inadequate or am I ugly? Which I’ve been told in both cases that im neither from both parties constantly. (I am overweight tho, but currently have lost nearly 25 pounds).Ah, the other part that I nearly forgot when I was talking about how our society has ingrained texting into our culture was the follow ups. This is what makes keeping a relationship or escalating one so difficult to me. Because it seems like it’s mandatory to text, and I just don’t know the social etiquette in order to pull this off. I don’t know if I should be texting this person everyday, or share a risky text or meme, I don’t know if I pissed them off or made them uncomfortable around me. I don’t know the timing of how long is a good time to wait until the next text. But worst of all is I simply don’t feel it in me to text. So I spend most of my days alone talking to no one watching Netflix or YouTube….I wish phones didn’t exist…..

For instance, a woman came up gushing about what a cute couple we are (nice) how I must love him so much and wouldn’t care if he was two foot tall (weird) and then proceeded to talk about our height difference for like five minutes while we were playing pool (please stop).

I work with indigenous clients and handle horrific police misconduct claims day in and day out. (I’d say 90% of my clients have been brutally beaten, strip searched or sexually assaulted by the police) I’ve done a lot of research on policing, have taken multiple criminology courses throughout university and have written several papers on state sanctioned violence and I know for a fact that our state’s police force is corrupt and racist as hell. I am deeply opposed to policing as an institution, and while I know that there are definitely great cops out there who do a lot for their community, I do not support the profession/institution at all. Recently, I went on a date with a guy I met last year. We met at a mutual friends birthday and became good friends but then fell out of touch and then reconnected about a month ago. I think he’s incredible - so sweet and smart and cool. We get along really well and have great chemistry. I haven’t liked anyone this much in a long time. Anyway, last year he was working as an occupational therapist. But when I went out with him recently, I asked how his job was going and he told me, “oh yeah, I don’t want to be an OT anymore, I’ve joined the police academy.” I was taken aback because I had no clue he had any aspirations to become a cop. I just said “oh...how come?” And he explained that he recognised police brutality as an issue but really thought that policing was a good opportunity to help people/protect the community and that’s why he wanted to do it etc. I know he means well and I do genuinely believe that he would make a good cop if/when he becomes one. But I also personally think it’s really naive to think that joining our state’s broken, deeply racist police force is a good way to serve the community. He’s a smart guy who is generally very left wing and very socially informed so this was honestly very surprising to hear. I pretty much instantly decided that I wouldn’t see him again because that is a deal breaker for me but when I’ve told my friends and family, a lot of them have said that I’m being too harsh and one track about this and that if everything else is perfect (which it is), I should give it a shot.

I actually explained it to (31M) him before we had sex how it could possibly happen, but it usually just mean I love the sex or love how you make me feel during an orgasm. He understood, but told me I shouldn’t say that and try not to catch feelings. I withheld the urge to say it . We’ve been talking for 3 months. He moved 5 hours away recently and said he didn’t want a relationship because of that. I understood and agreed to FWB. Fast forward a month later . I see him for the first time since our last encounter. While I’m giving him head he says “if I say I love you, it means I love the sex.” 

I thought he was just joking because it’s what I said the last time I saw him. But in the middle of sex he really said “I think I love you. Maybe we can make a long distance relationship work out. I want to see you again next week .” 

I felt that was very specific and not just someone randomly saying I love you when things get intense . After that he never brought it up again. It was like what he said didn’t happen. We had a conversation afterwards and he said he wanted to see me actually after the holidays . Which is a long time from now. I never said anything about the i love you . I know people say things during sex and don’t mean it , but why would he say that along with a relationship  ? Does it mean anything ?

He takes me on dates, we have long deep conversations and we seem to have a connection. He constantly checked on me to see if I was okay when I traveled to see him. I’m very inexperienced with dating and appreciate anyones advice. 

He’s told me before how he’s acted on his emotions quickly in the past and he didn’t want to do that to avoid anyone getting hurt. 

TL;DR!
FWB said he loved me during sex. While I know people say things they don’t mean during sex , he was very specific by mentioning a long distance relationship. However, he never brought it up again.

In order to find the one for you, take ownership of your personality while continuing to grow your maturity

Examples of personality: A love for dance, board games, fine arts, sports, ambition, laid-back, intellectual, high-energy, favorite shows/movies/books, etc

Each of our personalities are unique and we love certain things. You should never compromise what you love in order to try and fit the mold of someone you are attracted to. Why? Because then you will spend your life suppressing who you are to accommodate your relationship. Don't do it! Your personality was molded into you when you were born and is something beautiful and unique that the world needs! Don't be afraid to embrace what you love and let it show through! In order to find someone you will really connect with, you need to find someone that loves the personality that you naturally have, so you can live in abundance with what brings you life. That person is out there and you increase your chances of find the person who loves you personality, when you improve your maturity traits (see below)

&amp;#x200B;

Examples of maturity: physical health, emotional health, spiritual health, communication, empathy, responsibility, consideration, social skills, emotional intelligence, selflessness

While being laid-back can be a personality trait, there is a difference between the person who likes to camp in the woods and the person who never does their laundry. While your sense of humor may be sarcasm, that is never an excuse to be inconsiderate of others. Just because someone enjoys video games instead of sports doesn't mean that they are off the hook for taking care of their physical health. All aspects of maturity will enhance the beautiful personality traits that you have. Maturity traits are something that everyone can work on and will enhance your attractiveness while not compromising who you are. A lack of any maturity trait, whether it be health or quality communication, doesn't define who you are forever, and can be changed with determination and hard work.

I don't mean to harp on this, but I see so many people not growing in maturity and writing it off as their personality. That simply isn't true. I know introverts who have incredible social skills. How? They stepped out of their comfort zone and improved their maturity. Growing in maturity is often hard, because it is reshaping who you are. It will suck, but it doesn't take away from who you are, it carves that beautiful cherry wood personality that you have into an incredible sculpture for the world to see.

Sorry for rambling, I’d just like some advice.

I am a 22f who is both a virgin and never having been in a relationship. 

Why this is the case for me might be for multiple reasons. The biggest contributor for this for me is because of my depression. I have diagnosed Major Depressive disorder and anxiety since high school. I do go to therapy, and I am on antidepressants. However, I continue to have repeated episodes of depression and it’s been years.

I get sad to think about how I have yet to have a relationship (I am heterosexual) because I don’t know if I could be a good partner to a guy. It would never be my intention to hurt someone but I’m not the most mentally stable person. I feel like this makes me highly unattractive. I try to take control of my life and get a grip but seemingly out of nowhere I just become overwhelmingly sad and numb. 

At this point, I feel like depression will always be a part of me even if I keep pushing on and try to get better. I feel like it will lurk in the shadows. I don’t want to feel unlovable because of this part of me, but I also don’t think anyone would willingly choose someone like me. 

But if this is a part of me and no one will want me, I feel like I’m going to be single forever. It hurts my fragile heart that I don’t get to experience love, sex, intimacy, relationships, etc., the way my friends and peers do. 

How do I know I’ll ever be okay enough for a relationship? I’m not even sure there’ll ever be a time where I don’t have depression, and I don’t think any guy would actively choose me knowing this part me. Especially with how old and inexperienced I am, I lose hope for myself everyday. I don’t know what to do. 

I went on a couple dates pre-COVID but I never knew how I would be able to tell a guy in the future that I do have depression? 

TLDR: 22f, virgin, no relationship experience and having depression for years.
