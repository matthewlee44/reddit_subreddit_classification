6,r3njy6,1638048887,I have a huge thing for my former professor.,"I know. Stupid. I (22F) have know him (late 40s M) for about 3 years now and we’ve always had a very casual relationship. I met him my sophomore year in one of the labs one day and started talking to him way before I ever had a class with him, and I had 2 classes with him senior year, one in the fall and one in the spring. Our dynamic has always been fun, sarcastic, and all around great.  I would go to his office often and just vent to him and he would talk to me and give me advice and just chat. He even gave me his phone number before I ever had him in class, so that I could text him if I was going to campus to do research during the breaks and see if he would be there too. Weve always been kinda touchy too (not inappropriately, but whenever we would pass by each other we would maybe play punch the other or put a hand on the others shoulder or something. We also hug every time we see each other. ) he does that with other students too but I feel like it’s more frequent with me. I remember once we were walking down the hallway and I put my hand on his shoulder and he put his hand on it. Idk, small things but they make me think. Weve still been in touch since I graduated in May. It’s all very platonic (I think?) but I just can’t help but have feelings for him. We have great chemistry and everything is so effortless with him. Now that I’ve graduated, he vents to me too and it’s great. We don’t really text or anything though, only from time to time whenever we plan to go to lunch or something. I also know how highly he thinks of me as a student and always tells me how much better I am than other students. I stuck around after graduation and helped him and his research student, and we’ve gotten lunch a couple times in the last couple months. We both consider each other friends. He’s married and I know he loves his wife. I’m not sure if this is even the right place to post this but I needed an outlet.

8,r3nnla,1638049185,Finding faults in dates due to my own insecurities...,"Hi all!

I've (27, m) recently been dating this guy who's all around great. He spends a lot of time with me, is very fun and flirty, and is just generally very nice. When we're together, I feel extremely secure and happy. However, he's been very straightforward with me that he's not a good texter. Honestly, I don't even like texting and my texting with friends is very sparse.

Unfortunately, when we're apart I start feeling insecure and I guess I feel like I ""need"" him to text me in order to feel like he's still interested. This is pretty ridiculous on my part--he does so much outside of texting to show he likes me and he already said he's not good at texting. He even *attempts* to be good at texting, which I know is an effort he's making just for me.

Still, I just can't get over the mental block. I really don't wanna fuck this up. I catch myself thinking things like ""wow, he never messages me just to chat, he must not be thinking of me"" or things along those lines which then makes me question if I should just let it go. It's so stupid. And the craziest part is I know that if he *did* start texting me all the time, I'd be genuinely annoyed by it. 

How can I overcome my insecurities in these times that we're not together? I think this is being exacerbated by the holidays where I'm not seeing him nearly as often as we're both out of town. I'm trying to just focus on all the amazing things he does, but would love to hear suggestions.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3nnla/finding_faults_in_dates_due_to_my_own_insecurities/

The problem is me apparently, though the only advice I've really been given is ""any girl would be lucky to have you"", ""Just be yourself, they like that"". That was nice when I was 16 but nowadays there's more to it than that. I always start with a simple greeting when I match with someone with like ""Hey, my name is x, its very nice to meet you"" and it usually ends with me getting blocked etc.. I'm not trying to be the usual guys they come across that's usually like ""Hey"" etc..

27,r3oysg,1638052961,Not sure if friend is ignoring my messages because of their depression,"I recently started talking to a friend who I haven't spoken to since May. We had both decided to take some time off from each other due to our depression making it hard for us to maintain a long-distance friendship. We started talking again last month and had been texting each other almost every day until last week. I haven't heard from her since last Wednesday. Two days prior she apologized for being bad at responding to my messages. She told me she's not doing great right now because of her depression and school piling up due to finals. I don't hear from her on Wednesday so I decided to send a follow-up text on Monday just to check in on her. I don't get a reply. Days later I notice she's posting on insta and hanging out with her friends. I can't help but think this is something personal but on the other hand, maybe texting requires a lot of emotional energy from her. I just don't understand why she couldn't tell me she wants to be alone or is incredibly busy at the moment. I find it odd that we were having fun texting each other then she suddenly goes silent without warning.

This isn't the first time she's gone silent like this for a couple of days. Months prior to our break she was also going through rough depression and would disappear like now. Before she went silent last week I wanted to have a call to discuss boundaries and communication so if something like this were to occur we would both feel secure. Now I'm conflicted on whether I should send a message telling her I want to have this conversation. I feel like I shouldn't because I'm not sure what's really going on and if it's really about her depression and school piling up due to finals then I don't want to stress her out even more. School is already hard for her due to her ADHD and she's prone to having bad depression. I think the better option would be to message her once finals are over that way I can catch her in a better mood.

We started hanging out alone this summer when he invited me for lunch and then we went out for drinks a couple of times playing minigolf and satt and there's been some flirting on snapchat. He sent me selfies of himself asking which ones to use on his social media accounts and I was like I'm really bad at this you'll have to ask another girl and he was like you're the only girl I'm talking to. We used to text regularly on Snapchat although the frequency has kind of stopped a bit. If I'm not mistaken, there is sexual tension between us but I'm not sure. I think I might be mildly autistic because I suck at picking up subtle cues. 

I've met his friends and I've been to his place briefly when I had to pee and he was like let's go to my place I live nearby (lol). He has asked if I have a boyfriend in a joking way and whenever I'm out with some male friends he is always asking who I'm with. Recently I've also noticed his friend acting weird whenever I'm around, like there's a teasing vibe in the air and he knows something I don't. There was also this time recently when I was joking how I could only get socially awkward guys because I'm socially awkward myself and he was like no worries, those guys go on to become the next Bill Gates/Musk, and then in his last Snapchat he was like ""who knows maybe I'm the next Gates/Musk"". He has also said once I should stop using Tinder and try to meet someone in real life. He has also had longer hair and beard before, and I once said I like guys with short hair and beard and he got a haircut after a while and kept the beard/stubble.

My crush has always been snapchatting me when out drinking. What I find funny is that he never says something substantial. I feel like he wants my attention/a reaction from me. He calls me names from our internal jokes, says gibberish stuff, and has even called me when quite plastered. I took a snap of him being drunk and was like yeah I have this saved now trying to embarrass him and then he sent a snap he took of me when I was drunk and was like yeah I have one too! The day after he reached out and was like ""send me the Snap you took of me drunk"" and then asked me something completely different about some game, recommended me a tv show to watch and so on. Quite weird. 

So I'm like 100% positive he isn't into me and I probably just want to move on with my life and get rid of this urequited crush. Should I just be honest with him that I like him more than friends and want to move on with life if he doesn't feel the same? But I don't want to pressure him or anything and would like to maintain a cordial friendship with him. How should I tell him?

Again I'm mildly autistic and I don't trust my judgement when it comes to dating and relationships. Would appreciate help.

36,r3pplt,1638055137,Im exhausted and feeling too many emotions… I don’t know what to do at all…,"
Hello all,
Please be prepared for a long read….
I have been dating this guy for over a year now, and he’s chased me for a few years before I finally gave in and gave him a shot with me.At first things were great and now things seem as though it is falling apart. Well about 3 months ago, we signed our first lease together for a home and have been here ever since….around the same time of signing the lease, he asked me to marry him. In period that me and him have been together, we rarely have any happy memories shared together whereas spending time takes place because…he always hangs out with his friends and nearly always cancels plans with me to hang out with them….he also feels that I shouldn’t know his whereabouts but any time I should go out, he has to know mine. We both work different shifts at our jobs and sometimes 6-7 days a week and rarely have time together and when we do, he always leaves me home alone and when I start to tell him how I feel, he tells me to “suck it up” or sometimes it leads to a heated argument. I had even began to suggest to him that he should find a way to balance his time between spending time with I and his friends, but it’s going nowhere. And lastly, lastnight, when he came home, he left his phone unlocked and I happened to see that he has added his ex on social media and started sending her the “😍” emoji and swears that it was for her 4-year old daughter’s picture but the picture isn’t anywhere to be seen. This ex that I am referring to is the ex that he dated for two years before me. I am feeling so many emotions right now…. 😢🥺…I don’t even know what else to do…",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3pplt/im_exhausted_and_feeling_too_many_emotions_i_dont/

We’ve been on a few dates and talking for a few weeks. She’s a very social person with a lot of friends and some times she’ll sleep over at her friends houses (sometimes it’s a guy friend or female friend but nothing sexual happens). Her friends are really chaotic tho and will do pranks or take her phone or do stuff to mess with her. But she’s a relatively calm and peaceful person 

We go on dates once or twice a week and just Vibe. The dates have been amazing and she told me she really likes me. 

She’s a very sweet, innocent and genuine girl. Everything felt real and connected and shes so kind and considerate even tho she’s a brat at times lol

The other day  We had an amazing date, she told me she really liked me, she wants to be dating and she texted me when she got home. Later I got a text from her phone…it was another from dude and it said “she’s not home bro, she’s with me. I’m the guy she can’t leave” and send a pic of her shoes on the ground 

I texted her this morning asking what the hell. 

Apparently she was seeing a guy a month or so before we met 

They broke up and hes been asking her for his stuff back 

She was gonna drop it off at his place in the afternoon before our date but she was super busy so she decided to drop it off after she and I had our date 

He asked to talk. 
She said no and he took the stuff that belonged to him and got mad took her car keys, and her phone and dragged her inside the house to talk and she said no 

He apparently threw her in the house, threw her in the couch and took off her shoes and started yelling and arguing about why the won’t get back together 

She said she hid in the bathroom and he still had her phone and send pictures to me and all her family and friends 

Apparently he sent a mass message of dick pics to her contacts and send exclusively messages a picture of her boots next to his saying “she’s with me bro I’m the guy she won’t leave alone” 

She then yelled at him and he started hitting and choking her and she fought back (this was at 2 am)

She then said they fought and argued til 10 am (8 hours) when she finally got her phone and keys back and she texted me asking to explain

Its just soo hard to believe and now she’s mad bc I just don’t believe it",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3pwvd/we_had_an_amazing_date_and_she_said_she_wants_to/

I am trying to let them have space so they can see there old friends again and work, but I am starting to feel neglected somewhat because sometimes my messages are just left on ""seen"" or just hit with a like button.

42,r3q9mh,1638056745,Breaking up with my boyfriend while we still love each other,"I’m really sorry about this long text I just needed to get this out there.

Hi everyone, I’m posting this here more as a way of venting then anything else. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year now. When we started it was very casual and we definitely didn’t want anything serious with each other but unfortunately things didn’t turn out the way. I’m in love with him and I know he is in love with me too, corny I know. I study abroad and I still have three years left to do but he studies back home and I don’t know if I’ll be here any time soon, because I wanna travel the world I wanna embrace new opportunities and I feel like I can’t do that here. I’m about to start my course and we started having conversations about what are we going to do when I leave. It’s just really hard because we don’t think we can do long distance, I would like to try it but I don’t think he’s into that but actually I know he doesn’t think he can do it. He’s scared and freaking out about fucking up. It just really hurts to break up with someone you really love and for the first time in nearly 3 years is the first person I’ve been able to be close to and love. I’ve had a very toxic relationship before this and it broke my confidence and my mental health, and I finally feel like I’ve regained it. I just don’t know what to do. It’s really hard to be in a relationship with a timestamp, I feel like we’re in a countdown. I know this is selfish, The thought of him moving on hurts me. It’s complicated because we won’t be in the same country for a few years, and it’s not like I can ask him to move with me abroad. So I guess I just have to accept it but it really hurts because this is someone that I’m still in love with, and I don’t know how to deal with the situation it would be so much easier if I didn’t like him anymore. 
Anyway I just wanted to ask some tips on the subject what can I do to make it hurt a bit less and for me to move on as well.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3q9mh/breaking_up_with_my_boyfriend_while_we_still_love/

45,r3qzja,1638058789,Ladies and gents opinions on this?,"So to break it down- I matched with this absolutely amazing woman and after a couple of days of chatting we went out on a date- the banter back and forth was amazing, and I could feel a chemistry that was seemingly absent in prior dates that I had in the last few months- we shared some amazing laughs had some great food, had a couple of drinks and initiated physical contact- holding hands, arms wrapped around, she laid her head on my shoulder etc etc. 

We decided to go out for a couple of more drinks after so we dropped her car off at her place- I gave her the flowers I bought her because I knew she loves purple and yellow so I bought her some sunflowers and lavenders mixed in with a rose- she couldn’t believe it and called me the sweetest guy ever and kisses me numerous times- went out to the bar and had a couple of more drinks where she told me that she had a blast and she wants to see me again. But then she specifically said that she wasn’t going to do anything with me that night, I said that was fine and I wanted to see how things develop because I’d be interested in seeing her again. TLDR we went back to her place and we were talking and we got affectionate and ended up having sex. I stayed over we cuddled and the morning after shared some laughs in bed, cuddled some more and went and got coffee before I dropped her back off at her place. She told me numerous times she wanted to see me again and to text her when I got back home. That was last Friday going into Saturday. Since then she has been kind of mum, literally the last time that she sent me a message was on Monday- she was going back for her family for the holidays and she had told me and apologized for being really bad at texting and has called me when it’s been a few hours, but it’s Saturday evening and nothing- I said happy thanksgiving on Thursday but didn’t even get a reply back to that- I see she’s active but hasnt replied to me. I just don’t get it at all. Any advice I would like to see her again and even tried just to call her today just to let her know I’m a very straightforward guy, don’t beat around the bush and would love to be able to take her out again and to let me know.

50,r3rn86,1638060738,How to take it slow with someone you already had sex with?,"In my(28F) senior year of undergrad, I had a fwb/love interest. We did things intimately and even went out on a date, with thoughts and hopes on both sides of making things official. With immaturity and bad communication on both of our sides, we ended up getting into a bad disagreement but never stopped having sex for at least a year when we ultimately both moved back to our home towns; me in NY and him in MD. Besides our initial disagreement, we never really ended things. I could tell he didn’t want to talk to me and relationship was a bit strained but respectful. 

I entered a long term relationship a year after the split, stayed in it for 4.5 years. During the last 2 years of my relationship, a mutual friend of the college guy and I would tell me that he asked how I was. I shrugged this off as I felt like it was just coincidence and nothing to look into. This continued for 2 years where more recently he asked how my relationship was and if I was happy. Still not directly to me, my friend told him that I am still in a long term relationship and was planning on marriage - which was the truth at the time. 

I reach out cordially to college guy to invite him to a party I was throwing out mutual friend. Not expecting a positive response as he was the one to give me the cold shoulder years ago. I had convinced myself that I misunderstood his intentions in the past and that he hated me. Upon response, he was actually very nice and warm in conversation which I was not expecting. I confronted him via text that I heard he was asking how I was and said he could’ve just reached out. To that he responded that the conversation clearly wouldn’t stop at hi and he wanted to respect the boundaries of my relationship. 

In between the time from texting college guy and the mutual friend’s party, my relationship ended - I ended thing. Not because of college guy, there were plenty of reasons why the relationship wasn’t right although he was amazing and I love him deeply, it wasn’t meant to be. A week later, college guy and I meet up for the party. We talked about the reasons why it didn’t work but how he liked me the whole time and didn’t want to interrupt my relationship in any way. We had sex a couple times during that weekend, it was amazing. So sensual and full of eye stares and I missed yous. 

We have now decided to take it slow. Which I agree with as I want to see how we’d work out if we both are putting in the effort and I just got out of a long term relationship 2 months ago, not feeling the best. But we have a problem of defaulting to lust and having sex rather than real conversations.

56,r3ryfr,1638061695,"How do I stop feeling like I'm ""falling behind""?","Everywhere I look, I can't help but feel like I'm being robbed of something. No matter if it's some random person on the internet or someone I see in public, no matter how pathetic they make themselves out to be it always seems like that they're in a better position than me. I'm 19 years old living out in the middle of nowhere where the biggest freedom I have is being able to drive 45 minutes 4 days a week to the most beige community college I have ever seen that has *anything* but a ""community"". Meanwhile, everyone else (including all of my high school friends, who don't even like being on campus, no less) has the luxury of staying on a campus with a near infinite abundance of people and things to do, all in walking distance no less! I tell you, I must have really pissed someone off in my past life.

Usually it doesn't get to me, probably because most of the time my brain is too occupied with meaningless busy-work to care. This is the first time I've used this account in two months, and I've had longer streaks than that. But when it does come back, it comes back hard. I start noticing the people around me, I come to places like here and notice posts from people that are younger, the same age, or slightly older than me and see that what they see as problems I see as victories since they managed to get there in the first place! I try to make friends, but it is NOT easy in my current environment, especially since my interests are so far from the average person. Usually, I have no idea what someone my age is talking about and when I do, they don't want to hear anything from me. This is especially true with women. the few times I try to start a conversation with a women, one of two things happen, either A) They give very bland one word responses that allude to me that they aren't interested in conversing with me, or B) We converse how I would expect and they turn out to be a lesbian. I'm not even joking, I've had like 3 platonic female relationships and they all have turned out to be lesbian. I try really hard not to generalize people especially when it comes to gender, but is this insanely bad luck or what? The correlation is just too weird.

I don't know where I'm going with this. Basically, what I'm asking is how do I trick my brain into thinking that it's okay if I never get into a relationship? Is it just to work myself to death so then I'm constantly distracted and don't pay attention to all of the better things my peers are doing? Because as it is, there is no possible future. There's either no opportunity at all, interests and personalities are way out of line, or my line of work is entirely male dominated. Dating apps completely turning the world upside-down doesn't help, either.

Not sure if this is even the right place to post this, this problem probably goes way deeper than simple ""dating"" but I wanted it to be somewhere it would be seen by a lot of people in an opposite situation as me.

A: Okay? And most people my age are already having way more fulfilling lives than me. Don't see how that helps

R: ""Don't worry, things will get better over time.""
A: Bullshit. I've been feeling this since I was 16 at LEAST, I keep thinking it will get better between me developing new hobbies or meeting new people but it never does. If anything, things are now WORSE since I had to move to a new, worse location after high school to afford paying for college.

R: ""I didn't lose my virginity until I was [insert arbitrary age here], you'll be fine!""
A: Good for you, but your situation was probably much different than mine. In my experience, most people that say this stuff either had opportunity and just ignored it to a certain point or consciously avoided it because they didn't want to focus on it until later in life, which is perfectly fair, mind you, but not really relevant to my situation. I would love to at least *try* to get to know someone, but I feel that the opportunity for me simply doesn't exist unless someone can point out something I'm not seeing.

R: ""Any hobbies/clubs?""
A: The most ""normie"" and relatable hobby I have is probably guitar, which unfortunately I haven't picked up in a little while since I've been so damn busy with this shitty school stuff as well as other unrelated work things. My other hobbies are something that I guarantee less than 0.5% of the population are into and would probably scare more people off than I would befriend. For example, I have what I believe is probably the biggest [rhythm game guitar controller collection on the east coast](https://i.imgur.com/bAgRFS4.jpg) (until I'm proven wrong anyways), being worth at least $1000 going by ebay prices. You know anyone is real life that's into this crap? Didn't think so. 
As for clubs, I was into a fair bit in high school, most notably my robotics club, but I honestly didn't make too many connections at those and I also realized I hated STEM, so that's off the table. In my current ""community"" college, there is nothing once you subtract all of the religious and race-oriented groups that I obviously couldn't join. I did sign up for their music group, but it's been months and I never heard anything back. Oh well. Probably too long of a drive anyways, lol.

R: ""Why not transfer/drop out if things are going so shit for you there?""
A: Money and sunk costs, mostly. I do actually plan to transfer to a 4-year institution in fall 2022, but I most DEFINITELY will not be able to afford to live on campus and I hear that most friend groups are basically solidified by the end of the first year anyways, so the damage is basically done at this point. And as much I would love to drop out and immediately move to a more populated area, I don't want to live on the street all my life as fun as that sounds.

R: ""Just lift bro!""
A: Not a bad idea, but unfortunately I don't know of any gym that doesn't require a membership and isn't a 30 minute drive. At the end of the day though, it's just another distraction and isn't really tacking the main problem. What's the point of getting ripped if I don't even have anywhere to show off those muscles?

63,r3sn8b,1638063781,"Should we start calling initial IRL meetings with someone from a dating app ""meetups"" instead of ""first dates""?","I've started calling those initial meetings ""just a meetup, not a date""'s and I'm upfront about that in OLD, and it really helps reduce the weight of unstated assumptions about what can happen when you meet IRL.  Like, we're literally just meeting in public for 30 mins (or more if we're into it), and if we like each other, I'll ask you out on a real date.  I'm less anxious than ever about OLD now.  And it makes sense to me because before dating apps, romantic dates rarely happened until after you had seen someone at least once IRL, like at school/church/work.

I can only think of 2 downsides to this approach:

1) You have to accept the truth that 90%+ of these meetups fail, which is a little sad, but in my experience, the same is true no matter what you call these initial meetups anyway.

2) It obviously doesn't work if you just want a low-effort hookup.

Other than that, I see it as a win-win: everyone involved has lower anxiety and the outcome is the same if not better since people are more relaxed.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3sn8b/should_we_start_calling_initial_irl_meetings_with/

That said when I had sex with her on the first date I insisted on wearing a condom. 

I messed up because after I cum, I didn't pull out.   I can usually keep going and cum multiple times without losing my erection.  

Big mistake!!!   

Because my little guy must have not stayed has hard as I thought he was.    


So carried on having sex for a while I came a few times before finally pulling out.   Went to take the condom off and I wasn't there!!! 


I didn't panic.  I didn't catch anything or get her pregnant.  She actually become my long term girlfriend after.  

That said it was a bit of a disaster at the time.   


So on the first date we spent about 30 min trying to find the condom.  I tried to look inside her couldn't fine it.  

She asked me to look again.   So like a gynecologist I'm there looking for the missing item.   After thoroughly searching I find it deep inside her and manage to fish it out. 

Sounds weird.  We were both cool and we are very natural and chilled around each other with zero hang ups.

So there was a happy ended.    

Although I realise how risky it could have been.   

So my advise.     Pull out after you cum !!!  Even if you know you can keep going.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3t4f7/anyone_got_any_disaster_stories_advise/
74,r3t4t5,1638065256,Guy I'm dating has a fwb...,"So I've been dating a guy for over 2 months now. We've seen each other 2-4 times a week, every week. We're both in our mid twenties. Honestly, we do everything a boyfriend and girlfriend does... without the title. As the internet calls it, I'm in a ""situationship"". lol

Now, we've had some very long and honest conversations about where we stand. We both are looking for a relationship. Three weeks ago, in a fit of emotional frustration, I decided to be brave and ask him if he wanted to be my boyfriend. He told me he wanted to get to know me first before committing to a relationship. I understood and agreed. 

And then I asked if he was seeing anyone else, and here commenced the heartbreak. He told me he had a fwb he had arrangements with before he met me, and was seeing her too. I didn't get mad-- after all, we never spoke about exclusivity. But at that moment, I really crumbled down and I felt the guards I let down coming back up again.  

After some time, I decided that my desire to getting to know him more and seeing where this went was stronger than my discomfort of him having a fwb, so I decided to let it go for the time being. 

A few days ago, we had another conversation, where I asked if exclusivity was still not an option for him. And he told me he wasn't ready to do that yet. And he encouraged me to date other people too. 

A little background. He's dated quite a few girls, had long-term relationships, and he's at a place where the next person he meets, he'd like to marry. For myself, I've only done a LTR where I saw my partner once during the 9 months lol. I've never been in a relationship with someone IN-PERSON. 

I'm not really sure what to think. He's very honest about everything, and he tells me that if there's something that's bothering me that I should always just ask him. I've told him about how I felt. I told him that it bothers me, but it doesn't bother me ENOUGH to stop seeing him. Am I being stupid? 

WHY IS DATING SO HARD. lol

76,r3t9s0,1638065663,We had one date and had sex on the second meet. He blocked me before I got home.,"I (25F) matched with this guy (33M) on hinge about two weeks ago. He’s not entirely the person I would normally go for but I thought I’d try something else since my ex and I broke up to see if the problem is the type of guy I usually go for. I’m not someone who sleeps around, my number is in single digits and I’d like to keep it there for as long as possible. I’m a confident woman and I’m not bad looking.

Anyway, I went on a date with him at a bowling alley, he was 20-25 minutes late. He said he’s going to be a few minutes late tops… we had a good night. Spent about 3 hours on this date until the shops closed. We continued talking and it was really fun and easy going. Last night, I had a Friendmas dinner (Christmas dinner with friends) and we started texting again. He asked if I wanted to come over and I wasn’t sure because I had work this morning. I went over and we watched a stand up comedy for a while, laughed and had some banter so it was great. He slowly made a move after about and hour and I eventually got on top and started it. I laughed a bit and said, “I thought you’d never kiss me” and we proceeded to make out. It was going good, he didn’t really seem to know what to do with his hands at times. We both got undressed and he went down on me and I returned the favor. He seemed to enjoy it too much and because i didn’t want it to end so quickly, I asked if he had a condom which he said yes but it’s in the car. I laughed a bit and said “okay could you please go get it” he then called me “intense” which I’m kind of taking offence to right now.

He came back and I proceeded to get him ready again. He laid back, said he hates condoms as he put it on anyway. I got on top and rode him. Everything felt good, he didn’t just completely starfish so he did a bit of touching. I eventually took his hands and held on to them by his head and did a bit of dirty talk. He enjoyed it and it was over soon. He went to clean up and I was chilling on bed waiting for him to help me out when he’s done. That didn’t happen which is fine. We watched more tv and he started falling asleep. I left and got home after 2. Sent a “just got home” message and fell asleep. 

The “intense” comment was stuck in my head so I asked him to let me know when he’s up because I just wanted to clarify with him if that’s a bad thing or not.

Turns out he blocked me. This really knocked my confidence and I’m a bit hurt by the lack of respect and communication from someone in their 30s.

Maybe a week ago, my FWB told me they were feeling anxious that this was turning into a relationship and told me they wanted it to be ""more casual"". I asked if it was ok if we saw/slept with other people and they said yes but I know they currently aren't actively seeing anyone else. I also said at the moment I wasn't really talking to anyone. Their feelings with me are really confusing and I sort of got tired of them stringing me along. I only see the FWB every couple weeks and my roommate and I ended up hooking up again one day.

After my last date recently where we didn't feel the spark, I hopped back on the apps to continue on my way. Something strange happened. 

I've seemingly completely run out of women. Bumble filters: don't want children (huge I know in terms of dropping numbers), age 26-36, 15 miles. Hinge filters: exclude all religions (this has been good to find childfree as almost all Christians here lean towards kids), 15 miles, same ages. 

I live in a very well populated metro so increasing miles may not help much? Hopped on Wednesday and now today and both apps say more women in my area. Has this happened to anyone, particularly childfree people?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3u3yx/literally_no_women_left_to_swipe_in_large_sized/

I can't be the only one who doesn't send nudes.

89,r3ufvl,1638069295,"I (F23) always thought the one thing I truly wanted was a relationship, but now I know it won't make me happy (depression)","I struggle with anxiety/social anxiety and depression. Most of the things I experience every day make me feel nothing or make me feel anxious. I’m numb most of the time. Things that should bring me joy (friendships, hobbies, engaging and personal work) usually don’t give me more than a lukewarm satisfaction. When things are bad, nothing feels worth doing and there’s nothing to look forward to.

My ultimate desire has always been for a relationship. Growing up, I was obsessed with romance oriented media. All I consumed and thought about was romance. I constantly got infatuated with random people in my periphery I didn’t even speak to. I don’t date (combination of body image problems and social anxiety) and berate myself over it, have no platonic relationships with men, and still embarrassingly become infatuated with men for no reason. It’s usually just because they’re near me. I’m also often preoccupied with my appearance and agonize about how I look. 

I was reflecting recently and recognized I actually don’t know what love is. I’ve only experienced infatuation. I have no practice in building relationships. I actually don't really understand how to make new friends what with all of my mental health problems, so it's bizarre that I even think about dating. The more I think about it, the more I realize I only “want” a relationship because it would make me feel good. Or normal? I think the idea of being in a relationship, being loved, being attracted to somebody, gives me a drug like high. I become obsessed with people extremely quickly because the behavior becomes self rewarding. When I’m really depressed, which is most of the time, it’s the only thing that reliably makes me feel good and breaks the horrible numbness. 

I always thought that I wanted a relationship but I don’t think I want a “real” relationship. I just want someone to cuddle who pays attention to me because it will make me feel better about myself. I’ll get that high when I’m feeling down. I don’t think I really want the hard parts of a relationship, the having to try with new people in my life, the ups and downs. I just crave anything that will make my brain feel baseline. And I know it's not true, but I really strongly believe there's something wrong with me and I often think another person loving me will make that go away. But it won't. 

I always fall into online relationships with men and it momentarily makes me feel better, then it makes me deeply depressed during. I think if I managed to find a relationship, I’d end up addicted to the other person and will be even more unable to be happy on my own. I might even end up leaving them once that high feeling goes away. I also think I'm not in the right place to choose the correct people to date. I would 100% be led by my sense of self worth and could easily allow myself to be treated badly because I think I deserve it. 

So this is a success in a way. A year ago, I wouldn't have known myself enough to identify this, as obvious as it may sound. I would have just thought I wanted a relationship without understanding what was going on in my head and why I wanted that. I just don’t know what the next step is. I’m glad I realized this but I still don't know how to live for myself. I know what I want. I want to be able to form platonic relationships with men. I want to only think about making friends instead of being obsessed with the idea of ""love"". I want to learn about who I am as a person and what makes me feel whole instead of relying on other people. I don't want to keep seeing people as this image I create of them. I just don't know if I'll ever get there. I don't see the path right now :(  It just sucks when you're depressed your whole life and nothing really makes you happy, it's so easy to let things stay the same because everything else is so much work. But things seem to be changing in my head, so I have some faith. 

Thank you for reading! I know this doesn't really go here but I don't know, I had nobody to tell about my discovery so I thought I'd dump this here. Maybe someone else is going through a similar realization.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3ufvl/i_f23_always_thought_the_one_thing_i_truly_wanted/

92,r3ulx1,1638069827,My partners choice of porn makes me self conscious,"Hi. Yes I know porn is normal. No I’m not against it. But I’d like to know if there are people out there who have felt or feel the way I do and if there’s some sort of way to over come it. 

I’m a Hispanic female, I’m around 5’5, weigh around 150, and my body type is more so pear shaped. My breast size goes from a B cup to a C cup. I do workout for muscle gain, I love having big thighs, but I’ve always had a hard time loving the size of my breast. 

That being said, I’ve always had a hard time loving my body but I’ve never compared myself to other women nor have I ever felt less of a woman for my body type. My current problem is that I have a partner who watches porn every once in a while when we’re too busy to get intimate. I 100% understand and am okay with it. What’s bothering me so much is that recently, I’ve been watching what he watches out of curiosity and I realized that what he likes to watch is a lot of big busty women, especially in the breast department. It makes me feel way more self conscious to know that maybe my partner looks for bigger breasts in his partner and well that’s not me. It honestly brings me down to the point where I want to end the relationship and let him go find his person. I’ve talked to him about how I’d love to get work done on my breasts so I can be happier with them, he always says he likes them and that they’re a perfect size…. But I can’t help but feel like I’m being lied to because of the ladies he likes to watch….. I’m not sure how to stop feeling this way or how to help myself feel better.. so if anyone can help, I’d greatly appreciate it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3ulx1/my_partners_choice_of_porn_makes_me_self_conscious/

94,r3uryj,1638070374,Confused.. Not sure what to do,So I am talking to a guy and everything seemed to be going well.  We talked all the time and went on a couple dates. (Long distance). Anyways we had plans to hangout again in a couple of weeks for a football game and I invited him to a friend’s wedding in April. Thanksgiving night I get a snap that his grandmother took matters into her own hands and set up a blind date with a girl.  He’s not out yet to his family due to his family not agreeing with the lifestyle.  Well that blind date is now an arranged marriage and it is some time this coming week.  He doesn’t want to do it but is trying to keep his family happy.    So should I continue to talk to him after he’s married ( he says they will get a divorce rather quickly) or should I just leave and take a chance of him never talking to me again. I really like him and I don’t want to lose him as he checks a lot of my boxes.   What should I do?,dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3uryj/confused_not_sure_what_to_do/

96,r3uycy,1638070952,What is your personal preference regarding men and facial hair/clean shaven?,"Right now I live in a rural area and most of the women seem to go for the men with beards.  Hunting, fishing, quading, and drinking are popular in my area.  I've been clean shaven my entire life and the longest I've gone without shaving was 2 weeks.  I got a little more female attention and some said I looked better with a beard while others said it didn't fit my personality.

A little about myself: I don't like guns, I could never harm an animal unless I was starving and needed a food source, I don't have fun fishing, I don't like getting dirty in a side by side or mudding.  I also can't drink anymore due to 3 gastrointestinal comorbidities.  I have nothing in common with a lot of people in this area.

I'm passionate about Technology, my family, watching movies, taking naps, taking walks, listening to music, occasional video gamer, NFL football, CFB, entrepreneurship, investing, and business.

I also am big into being generous to other people and being able to approach and converse with people I feel like introducing myself to who feel like positive, happy, upbeat people. I feel that being clean shaven makes me more approachable.  I just feel like an outcast in my area.

My haircut is a little longer on top and a 1 guard on the sides and back.  I like looking professional.  I like to wear t shirts and sweatpants when I'm home but I like wearing blazers, sweaters, leather jackets, turtlenecks, Chelsea boots, loafers, etc.  I dress pretty conservatively and think before I speak.  While I have some conservative views and consider myself a moderate politically I lean democratic.  Almost everyone in my town is conservative which I don't agree with a lot of their social viewpoints.

I just had shaven tonight and my face has broken out like crazy and is bumpy.  The itchiness was so intolerable and I itched so much I drew blood.  I freaking hate beards and facial hair.  I don't like the aesthetic which I find sloppy, and it feels terrible.  My productivity probably dropped 75% the last two weeks.  I couldn't think of anything else but how much I wanted to shave it off.

To sum it up:  is not having a beard a dealbreaker? Would women in cities be more tolerable of my style?

I hate being in a rural area.  I apologize for the punctuation and grammatical errors.  I also go on tangents due to my ADHD.  My mind is all over the place.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r3uycy/what_is_your_personal_preference_regarding_men/
