1,o860cn,1624691907,Does he like me?,"There's a guy in college and we take the same courses (overwhelmingly) and we talk regularly through social media, like every other day. He once asked me out on lunch, and a week ago we went and played golf. He also asked me to join him to watch sports at his friends house. He makes a lot of jokes and comments that are funny and I have a good laugh now and then.

The thing is, I can't decipher whether he is just a nice and friendly guy that likes to hang out as friends or if there's interest from his side. He is very friendly in person and in text, and very talkative. 

The thing is I have kind of bad self confidence and I never believe guys are interested in me. I was bullied as a child a lot so I don't trust anyone and I always think its some kind of joke if someone shows interest in me because I used to be made fun of in this way so as an adult I have a very warped view of things.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o860cn/does_he_like_me/
2,o86285,1624692183,Me (28M) and her (19F) both agreed on finally doing something. Where do we go from here?,"I was very hesitant in the beginning as she started drunk texting me and saying inappropriate things (I have posted before about this) but apparently she's just a little odd like that. I've known her from Christmas when she started working at my job, didn't really speak to her much but she became quickly attached to me at the start of the year when we got to know each other. I thought it was a little bit odd at first how I was the first port of call for her late night random thoughts as it did seem she was obsessed/infatuated with me as I didn't treat her any differently than the other girls I work with. Though I suppose I have helped her with some personal issues and gave meaningful advice.

It all came to a head last Saturday when she literally asked me to have sex with her after a normal conversation sterred into that direction and honestly I was like why not provided the workplace didn't know. We didn't work together until the Wednesday of that week and one of the other girls informed me she actually posted about me on her private snapchat story which sent my alarm bells ringing.

I wanted to talk to her about the sex thing to make sure she understood what she was agreeing to but tried to say she didn't remember having that conversation. I joked about did she need to see the texts to jog her memory and she was like ""omg no please don't"" but then said it's none of anyones business what we get up to when I told her to be careful about what she posts so she obviously does remember.

I talked to her on Friday and said I needed to speak with her and she thought it was the sex thing again, said she was embarrassed about it and I asked her if she wanted to go out sometime which she said yes to obviously. She thought I had no interest and that's why she didn't ask me before. Though that's a little confusing considering she literally asked me to have sex with her. I hope she doesn't expect to get it on at work since we can't do it at hers or mine due to logistics issues.

That night we talked and I said we'd talk about sex some other time and what we are both looking for. She said it was the most adult and mature message she has ever received which was very nice to hear. Though she said we'd probably have different views on what we want as she ""never liked being a one man's girl idk"" but is open to talking it over. So, the question is where do we take it from here?

TL;DR: Me and my co worker finally agreed on doing something. Does she want FWB or something else? Where do we take it from here?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o86285/me_28m_and_her_19f_both_agreed_on_finally_doing/
3,o863wy,1624692432,Any takers?,"Ok don’t take this the wrong way but just looking fir what kind of game is being played here and what it means I should do. Specifically with online dating. I’m a straight male Interested in women. I see a lot of girls with these profile pics that are kind of raunchy and super suggestive/revealing so naturally I assume they are interested in hooking up. Which is what I’m interested in at that time (Though not exclusively). I want something serious too though  not exclusively. 
I’m not kidding when they show images that are directed at their body with nothing on. It kinda lures you in. I know that’s a touchy thing to say right now but you don’t see me with my shirt off in my whitey tighties expecting a serious relationship while I stand there and twirk or something obvious. I have more self control than that. I can tell they’re trying to drive me crazy or something. And I’m respectful when I say this. But 
What are they testing here? I know it’s a game of some kind. It’s come up repeatedly in online dating. It doesn’t drive me crazy so much as it’s just more of a “that’s odd” kind of a thing. (Not to say I’m not enjoying the free eye candy)
I answer back. Most of the time they approach me first or send me a like when I’m minding my own business. 
I may send out a few likes here and there but I know what not to chase. They end up flaking off which is kind of just odd. I think they expect it to have a stronger effect on me. Might be fun for them. Trying to crush me or something. And I might be willing to take this test of theirs and pass it if I just knew if I was being tested directly (which is never  “IF”, it’s WHEN; which is all the damn time) anyways, My question again is why they do this, what can I do about it to answer correctly in THEIR world if I were to play this game? and why would it would be worth it? Why waste my time?  Is there a way to even beat this game? Or should I just get the hell out of there?

4,o865g1,1624692658,Finally asked her to be my girlfriend and she said yes..,"Hey fellow redditors, just sharing my happiness since my friends are asleep and I have no one to tell right now . So I met this girl on a dating app about 3 months ago and we really kicked it off. We talked for a few weeks before deciding to meet. Turns out we live about 5 minutes apart! We have a lot in common, like a lot of the same movies and music and have the same sense of humor.  We’ve been going out for about two months now when the topic of dating apps came up and we both found out the two of us had deleted it off our phones cause we didn’t think we needed it anymore. 


I got the sense she’s a genuine, honest person which is so hard to find these days (I had bad experiences lately.) Meeting her has been such a breath of fresh air. A lot of girls wait for the guy to make the first move. This girl actually asks me out first and plans dates, I’ve never met someone like this honestly. Maybe I was looking at the wrong girls.


Tonight in my car, the conversation was dying and I just said “I’m just gonna be up front, do you wanna make out?”
And she said was waiting for me to ask. So we spent a good 15 minutes driving around trying to find a dark enough spot, laughing at how silly it all was. Eventually we found a dark parking lot and we moved to backseat where we made out intensely, she straddled me and it was really hot and passionate and we both said we haven’t had an experience like that. Eventually we just embraced in the back seat, holding hands and listening to music (arctic monkeys, her favorite band). That’s when I decided to tell her I really like spending time with her, and after all these dates, was wondering if she wanted to be my girlfriend, which she quickly agreed to.


Now I’m home after a long day and I feel really good. I can finally end the mindless swiping on dating apps. I have a smart, funny, pretty girl who genuinely feels the same and it’s just a nice feeling after this  long dark year.

First friend he met, he wanted me to sleep over at his this time, he was cooking for me, we were holding hands and kissing. After dinner he kicked me out at 3 AM.
I knew this was going to end (I'm moving - he knows) but I didn't think it would be like this. I'm numb and dumbfounded.

6,o86c32,1624693631,My sexting partner removed me on Snapchat suddenly. Was it because I didn’t send nudes? (Read all),"Originally he found me on a sexting page and we exchanged Snapchats (the notorious nude swapping place…)

We talked every day for almost a month, he sent me a lot of nudes. I didn’t send nudes but I did send teasing pictures showing skin and was very verbal in my texts. I told him that maybe later on I MAY BE be comfortable showing more. He made his own decision to show his face a few times, I kept mine private.

Everything went well, after a few weeks of constant texting he didn’t respond to me for a whole day. Then he apologized and told me he has some mental problems recently, but said that he likes talking to me and doesn’t want me to think he doesn’t like me. I told him it’s all cool if he doesn’t want to talk, but I also told him I’m always here if he wants to open up something. He was very happy about it and we kept talking for a few weeks every day. 

He told me many times how he’d like to date me if we were closer and kind of confessed some “feelings”? He always asked about my plans for the day and so did I. I gave him compliments also. 

The last time we talked was a week ago as usual - we had our steamy and hot chat, and as usual the chat ended as we both were satisfied and he responded “For sure” to something I wrote him. 

I didn’t respond anything as, well, it wasn’t anything to respond to and we were done and had to go to work both.

Unexpectedly, he didn’t message me after that for a week at all. Usually he would’ve messaged when he’s in the mood or asked how’s my plans that fay.

This afternoon I noticed he removed me from friends.

**I’m kind of sad because we didn’t only sext, but also shared nice conversations and got to know each other… pretty well actually? **

**Or was it just his attempt to make me trust him and give him my nudes?** I know some men know the psychological route to make women open up.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o86c32/my_sexting_partner_removed_me_on_snapchat/

I just opened up completely to this mystery person. But eventually i got sick of his lies and I tried to cut ties with this person. Later on he kept making new profiles and using different names pictures as “his face”. I would catch him though cause I would eventually realize they have the same mannerisms when speaking and same personality. 
I deleted the dating app because I was traumatized by this one person.

8,o86jec,1624694660,Triggered,"
 I think my anxiety was triggered once my partner admitted he was attracted to someone at his gym and wondering if she had a bf, which was probably my fault for asking about his attraction to others. My response was maybe we shouldn’t be together if that’s what goes thru his mind but he refused and said i was tripping. Since then, I’ve been wanting to push him away in fear of embarrassment or the possibilities of how far his attraction of others may go although he keeps affirming that it was only a thought and he only wants me. I know transparency should bring you closer but that didn’t do well for my mental health and now I’m trying to not shut down or push him away.

14,o87swk,1624701018,How do I (25M) text this girl (26F) I am being set up with?,"Hey everyone!

25M here - so for context, one of my close friend's has a work friend (26F), who I saw in one of her Instagram posts a long time ago. For years, I've had a lack of confidence, so I never mentioned to my friend that I thought she was cute, but after spending the last year working on myself in many ways, I have adopted a different personality / level of balanced confidence.

So a few days ago, I mentioned to her that I'm actually interested in her friend. She was ecstatic and immediately said we would be a great fit. As we were hanging out, my friend texted this girl and asked how her dating life was going / whether she was interested in being set up.

Said girl said that she had only recently gotten back onto apps after taking a break, but was keen on something like this. My friend then sent her a message telling her about me (almost like a dating app bio) and sent my Instagram. To that she responded positively and maintained that she was interested.

My friend then gave me this girl's number. I sent her a text earlier to just introduce myself / say I got her number from our friend, little joke acknowledging it was funny/weird, and asked how her weekend was going.

Couple of hours later, she replied and acknowledged the joke and seemed to like it, then replied appropriately and asked how my weekend was going.

Now we've never met each other in person, and both seem to only have had interactions through dating apps. I'm very forward and usually like to match, chat for a day or two and ask them out for a drink (not a fan of wasting time - and this works more often than not).

Given this situation is slightly different, and I have 0 experience in this, I'm now feeling a bit nervy / conscious which is almost throwing me off my normal mindset.

Should I simply approach her like another dating app match, or be more conscious in conversation? I do want to hint at grabbing a drink in the next few messages but don't want to force anything.

Tips / advice?

19,o88lye,1624705036,My girlfriend has major trust issues,"(For context, she’s 18 and I’m 19. We’re also in a long distance relationship)

Before we start things off, I just wanna say that no matter what, I love my girlfriend. I absolutely love and adore her. She’s beautiful, pretty, amazing, kind, generous, thoughtful, smart/intelligent, sexy, hot as fuck, and just an overall great person and girlfriend. I’m so lucky to have her in my life and she’s genuinely one of the best things that’s ever happened to me. I don’t know what the fuck I did to deserve her. 

However, if I’m being honest here, her lack of trust and faith in me breaks my heart and makes me question my worth as a boyfriend. I truly do love and cherish her from the bottom of my heart but she’s almost always accusing me of liking other girls that are physically/geographically closer to me. She’s particularly fixated on this one girl who I went to middle school with and use to like back then; she always brings her up (I never bring her up) and she makes comparisons of herself to that old middle school crush (who I haven’t even talked to anymore for literally a couple years by this point). I’ve even stopped following her and other girls and stopped liking their pictures when I found out that me doing so made my girlfriend insecure because hey, it’s no big deal I respect her enough to do that courtesy for her. But it gets to the point where if I’m just eating with my friends (who are literally all guys) and we go out in public to eat and hang out, she accuses me of hanging out with other girls or whatever. 

It’s been an emotional roller coaster to say the least and it makes me sad that my girlfriend doesn’t full trust, faith, and confidence in me while I have complete trust and confidence that she’s loyal to me and our relationship. I don’t like nor do I want other girls, I only want her. I’ll be straight up honest, I’ll see a cute girl out in public and think “damn she’s cute” but at the end of the day, it’s my girlfriend who I care about and want the most. I’m loyal to and I respect her enough to not hit on other girls even though we’re thousands of miles apart from one another and I like to think that she employs the same logic. But it gets really taxing having her tell me that I’m cheating on her with someone else when all I’m doing is literally hanging out with my friends and she’s literally the only girl who I talk to on a regular, daily basis. Like, here’s me pouring out my love, devotion, and admiration for her and I’m all hers but then she’s telling me that I like other girls who are physically closer to me. 

It just hurts me that here I am, loving and caring about her, and she’s gonna tell me all this. It doesn’t help that I work a physically and mentally demanding job. Whenever I come back from work and decompress for the day, seeing her accuse me of cheating or not being faithful shatters my heart and makes me feel down. And what hurts me the most is whenever she asks if we should break up. She tells me that she doesn’t actually mean it whenever she asks that but to me, posing that question is serious and punches me hard in the heart. I know I’m a terrible, shitty boyfriend but I’m trying to do what I can with what I have, especially with my demanding job taking up a large chunk of my day. Sometimes all I wanna do is just relax and talk to her but then sometimes she just has to bring up the fact that I don’t care about her or I’m cheating or whatever. 

Speaking of which, my girlfriend has a certain standard. She wants me to respond on time every time as much as possible and she just asked me if I could stop following other girls. The thing is that I feel like that’s pretty controlling; I sometimes can’t always respond on time because my job can drag me away at literally any moment and if I’m being honest, I think it’s unfair that she wants me to stop following other girls. I personally don’t care if she follows other guys because I don’t like nor do I want to control her and her actions but it doesn’t sit well with me that she wants me to do all this. Maybe I’m just a shitty, terrible asshole of a boyfriend but that’s just how I see it. 

And yes, I’ve told her all of this in some variation multiple times and I always reaffirm my love and affection for her. Despite that though, she continues to do the same above to me and it feels like I’m trying to run through thick mud whenever this happens. 

Again, at the end of the day though, I love her and I truly do believe that she does love and care about me. Despite this, I like to think that we have a great and amazing relationship that continues to keep moving forward no matter what. It’s obviously not perfect and it could be better but I don’t wanna leave her. Never. I love her with all my heart and even though it hurts whenever she says all this to me, I still want to keep going no matter what.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o88lye/my_girlfriend_has_major_trust_issues/

To preface it, before him and i began dating last year, him and one of my close friends ended up having sex two years ago and he ghosted her once him and i started to talk. I knew they hooked up and before him and i got serious i talked to her about it trying to clear stuff up and see what her thoughts/ feelings were towards it. She told me she was fine with, doesn’t like him like that and literally felt it was a mistake that they hooked up and wanted us to date. Now fast forward presently, He confessed to me that last summer while me &amp; him were together (we took a break this past november-april) him and my friend would flirt behind my back, than when me and him broke up during the winter he sent her a nude, than currently while he was away he was drunk and had the intention of starting up a conversation with her to flirt, but didnt and ended up messaging her wanting to "" clear the air, apologize"" for how he ghosted her and is trying to come clean to me about all of this because of feeling ashamed and wants to have a clean slate, move on and build a better foundation for our present relationship etc... After him dropping all this news on me i went mute, and just started laughing hysterically because i literally didn't know what to feel. And on top of all this coming to light, me and this group of friends ( including my bf &amp; this friend) are going away to a cottage in a few days... The worst possible timing. 

He kept telling me he's trying to be better for me, and doesn't want to hide anything else, but it makes me sick to my stomach that a) his intentions at first were sneaky and ultimately trying to cheat and b) that i had to go myself, to one of my best friends to clarify all of this information rather than her having the decency to tell me straight up about last summer, about the picture and about him messaging her this past weekend. i'm lost &amp; confused, honestly have no idea how to feel or what to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o8as8y/a_double_slap_in_the_face/

On several occasions during my life women have just assumed i'm gay. I'm not at all and i literally have no idea why they think this. To the point were at college i was getting bothered by these gay dudes because some girl had told everyone she thought i was gay because i was 20 and had never had a girlfriend.

I turned it off as i felt bad for the guys swiping on me. At first it was really nice to have people find me attractive but at the same time i wonder  now if my inability to find a girlfriend is solely because they think i like men. I work in the arts so maybe this plays into it? I don't act particularly feminine, i'm in shape.

47,o8bpgv,1624717274,I really don't know how to be flirty/intimate with girls that like me back out of respect.,"Hello. I really don't know how to be flirty/intimate simply because you shouldn't treat girls like sex objects, don't sexualized their body, and don't tell them what to wear. No matter what, always be respectful is my go to model. I'm just a respectful oblivious guy.

The problem arise when a girl actually likes me back. I have got consented booty pic's and nudes just being nice, and I delete them because you shouldn't sexualize women's body. I have been completely unbothered because I just want to respect women, though I do say nice about their if they ask me too. I even remember one girl asked me if I saw her booty she sent me, and told I did, I just ignored it. I just want to respect girls bodies so I can be a good guy.

Another problem is clothes. You don't own a girl, she's her person with free will. Yet it gets super when a girl sends me a picture of her in clothing (sometimes really sexy looking), and I just say they look nice whatever they wear. I only had 2 girls (different years i met them) who consented to send me pictures in lingerie, and I just didn't know what to say because I didn't want to disrespect them. I gotta be respectful at all times.

The last problem is the sexual object problem. I'm a virgin, and I haven't had sex yet. But it's extremely hard when sexy talks/text comes. I would love to lose my virginity to a great girl, but I wouldn't know how to look at her sexy. Like I don't want to hurt her, or not satisfy her needs. Obviously a girl would think I'm physically attractive to sex with, but she'll definitely have a hard time trying to get me all sexual and dirty talk. I just don't want to a object her, and make her feel less human.

TL:DR &amp; Summary: I simply want to do my best to respect women, but I wouldn't know to do if they liked/flirty back &amp; wanted to get intimate with me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o8bpgv/i_really_dont_know_how_to_be_flirtyintimate_with/

I’m so fucking ugly and no woman has ever thought I was attractive. No girl that I’ve asked out has ever wanted me. I’m always just a friend to girls. I know my personality isn’t shitty because I have a lot of girl friends and they seem to like being around me. I don’t go after prett or average girls, I only ask out girls that are also unattractive but I can rarely find any. The ones I do find are only interested in my average or good looking friends. 

I’m just too ugly for any girl to want to be with me. I’m in college, I have a job, I make my friends laugh, but no girl has ever had interest in me. I don’t want to die alone. I feel like if I’m stuck like this I’m inevitably just going to blow my brains out or go full incell so I can at least pretend the problem isn’t me.

Do I have a chance or should I just quit while I’m young so I don’t waste my life chasing after something I’ll never have?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o8cbo3/if_im_an_ugly_guy_trying_to_date_in_2021_should_i/

For whatever reason I've found that the women around me have been pretty receptive, I've gotten a few numbers over the month. Although nothing has really come of them yet outside chit chat. And due to this I've been becoming more receptive to body language. Well there is a amazing beautiful women I've had a crush on that I've never really talked to at work but always wanted to. Well today I decided to go strike up conversation and she would not stop giggling at everything and smiling. I made a joke here or there but mainly it was just the usual ""how's your day"" kinda stuff. And the entire time her replays came with giggles attached to them. I don't think a single one of her responses was without them. 

However from what I've been told about her she is a naturally anxious person who is slow to open up. So I'm wondering how to determine if the laughing was a nervous tick related to her general state. Or a sign that she may find me attractive and thusly is just very happy I'm talking to her.

75,o8e91v,1624725524,Ended things with a guy because all he wanted to do was text... (18F) (21M),"So i’m from USA hes from spain, the city he lives in is the city i’ll be moving to at the end of august which is how i found him. We had been talking for like a little over a month and a half basically everyday. (i’m 100% sure he’s not a catfish, some of the people i know from the college i’m going to know him personally and we talk on snapchat so he sent me live pics and videos.)

He seemed very interested in me and i was very interested in him and over time as we started to get to know eachother more i began to feel really fond of our conversations so i knew i wanted to start advancing past snapchat messaging. So casually one day we get into a conversation about how his english was really good and i ask him can he show me what his accent sounds like (as a way to warm up to possibly calling) and he’s like “meh maybe later” and at the moment i assumed he was just shy.

But then yesterday i just started to think if he can’t even show me his voice why would he actually want to go on dates with me when i get to spain? Then i’ll have wasted 4 months talking to a bluff. So after i got his daily message today i told him not to send me messages anymore because i don’t want to get anymore attached and the whole text only thing doesn’t feel right. To which he replied “ok i’ll stop then” and i said thanks and he said “yeah sure”

Now i just feel sad because i spent so much time talking to him and i feel like we really did have a bond even if it was just a fake text one. Which is why i wanted to start warming up to a skype call by asking him to show me his voice. But his response and actions showed me that i think he liked me but wasn’t looking for anything beyond a text buddy. I feel guilty and keep thinking maybe i should’ve just told him straight up call me or leave me alone but if he wanted to he would’ve said so when i mentioned texting not feeling right, right?

Anyways the girl my best friend is dating is the best friend of a girl I was dating (F19) so she was also supposed to be at the after party. So I had dated this girl for like 2 months we had done some kissing and I had met her parents nothing more.

We arrive at the party, it sucks and I don’t know anybody there, I talk to my friend and he promises me that We Will stick together and I’ll sleep at his place since I work the day after. I meet the girl I’m dating and the vibe is pretty weird, when it’s time for me to leave my best friend asks me if he fucks everything up for me if he sleeps at his girls place. I tell him that yeah I can’t get home it’s 2:30 am and I don’t have any keys home. He tells me to ask my girl if I can sleep at her place and she says no, then my best friend just leaves with his girl and my girl walks with me to a bus station. It wasn’t awkward after she said no but now she’s started to ignore me completely. I understand that this is probably over now but man I want to talk to her in some way should I write to her or just leave her be?

1 year later, I got myself together. She sometimes crosses my mind because we got a lot of things in common, so I chatted with her again to pick up where we've left off. I asked her out to hang out together with my friends, and meet in person but she was out of the city. She did gave me a ""sure"" when I asked her to just tell me if she's around the city.

Honestly I'm not sure if I got a shot with her. I seem to be the only one taking the initiative — asking her questions about herself, coming up with a topic, and carrying on the conversation. But she does reply in a ""not for the sake of doing so"" way (for the lack of term lol). After that, I have randomly chatted with her on something that reminded me of her, but she hasn't replied nor seen my last message. It was close ended however.

Most apps you sign up to after a few hours show you that a person likes you, but you cannot see their profile until you buy a subscription service.



These days im not a sucker, but from my experience a few years ago all they do is show you a fake profile, or a random person who hadn't even seen your profile to begin with. 


I recently signed up to Badoo,  and guess what? After 2 minutes of using the app someone liked my profile but I need a subscription to see who it was? No thanks. 



This kind of crap preying on the mentally vulnerable should be against ToS of the app or play store, but I doubt anyone has gathered enough evidence to submit a report.

Badoo,
Tinder,
PoF,
OkCupid.

94,o8gqct,1624733592,How do I start wanting to be in a relationship?,"Please bear with the weird phrasing of the title - I'll explain:

I'm nearly 30 years old; through high school I had no girlfriends, then a couple in my early twenties, and some flings both around that time and after.

But since 21, I've had no serious girlfriend, no relationship that lasted more than a couple weeks.

In fact, multiple times, I've literally been in a bedroom with a girl, and just left, prior to sex.

This is the basic matter of this question. It's not a performance issue, but a psychological one.

This post is long, but this is as much as I could condense the past 8 years of my lack of a dating life.

The last girlfriend I had, at the age of 21 (my second one ever) brought up some quite nasty facets of myself, and the dynamics of relationships:

\- She was trying to get pregnant the entire time. This was obvious in retrospect (she kept taking pregnancy tests and telling me about them) but I was so naive at the time it didn't hit.

\- The above scared me at how easily I either denied or was not aware of the possibility, and at how diabolical women can be. (Yes the problem in all of this is that I generalize this possibility to all women).

\- The breakup was mutual, in that we both agreed, but I was not happy in the relationship (neither were) yet I felt trapped and powerless that I could not end it despite wanting to (which is an echo of my parents' dynamic). We ended up splitting up because she had to leave the country, thank god for that.

\- Despite how bad the relationship was, and that I wanted the breakup, and how easy it was to see each other off the day she left, the ensuing months were a horrible hell for just what I put myself through mentally. I attach so fast and they (women) become so all-consuming of my view of my future (even ones with a shit relationship dynamic) that it is a major blow to me even when someone I just met doesn't like me or turns off of me (probably in large part due to my neediness).

I was just starting to come out of my shell with women around that time, and then after that relationship, as a distinct marker point, my relationships with women started to go way downhill right away. I didn't have sex again for years.

So I am stuck between a kind of rock and a hard place of my own doing. I want a relationship on some levels - specifically the ""need""/desire for companionship and physical/emotional intimacy - but I block myself off preemptively, both, admittedly, from a fear of rejection, but further on down the line, as I pay more attention, I sort of feel like I ""should"" want them, but some thing in me (all that aforementioned) doesn't actually want them, because the consequences would be too dire..

Yet the paradox here is that if they give me the time of day, I'll go as far down the rabbit hole of attention as they will tolerate me (lack of intimacy), while still somehow having that block of wanting(biologically)-but-not-wanting(psychologically) sex because of a kind of extremist view of some kind of commitment that will imply or force (even if only in my mind - and seems to be that's the case).

Thus I am frustrated.

I have a natural desire for women, but multiple layers of conflicting psychological blocks.

I see women as man-eaters, who none the less I readily and easily commit to - in fact it's my default - whether or not they want that from me, and despite not having any around, they (whichever random woman is physically attractive, even if she expresses no interest in me) instantly become top priority in my life (let alone if they stick around any length of time, the gap between them and whatever second place is just amplifies).

I am not enjoying this. I am not enjoying how I make myself go on a mental and emotional roller coaster despite (or maybe causing?) having no ongoing or even fruitful sexual relationships with women. And yet I am trying to protect myself from them. 

I want therefore something I feel is harmful for me, and it's a paradox.

I suppose, if I could boil it down, I'd like to ask how I could genuinely want for women, without this view that they're out to get me or that regardless of their intention I'd be stuck, or owe them something (my commitment) even right out of the gate?

I think later on there's more to unpack than that - like getting back the courage to go meet them - but I realized I'm never going to do so much as that as long as I think that ultimately, having sex with them will lead me down a dark path of trapped commitment to an overall negative factor in my life.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o8gqct/how_do_i_start_wanting_to_be_in_a_relationship/

He's cute, and always seems eager to talk/friendly the couple of times that I've talked to him. However, I just learned yesterday that he's a senior in college (so probably 20-21 years old).

I wouldn't be opposed to going on a date with him, but at the same time I feel kind of awkward (?). I'm a good amount older than him and been out of college for 3+ years, so I assume he'd probably be most interested in college girls anyway.

Assuming he's attracted to her, how would a guy view a slightly older girl hitting on him/asking him out? Would it seem desperate/creepy? Flattering? Or neither?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o8gxz7/how_would_a_guy_feel_about_being_asked_out_by_a/

99,o8h2ui,1624734744,My Tinder Date have planned to have sex on our first date. Thoughts or advice ?,"I'm 23M and met this amazing girl (22F) in March2021. We talked. We vibed a lot and found great compatibility and grew to like each other very fondly. When she first expressed her desire to have sex with me (a virgin) I was taken aback, afraid. Eventually I measured up to her requirements mostly because no one in my life ever expressed their desire to have sex with me so I kinda agreed to it. 
Apart from normal conversations, we have sexted a bit and she's expressed physical desire for me. I reciprocated because...well.... I've never been desired this way and she is attracted to my personality more than just physically. 
Do I really want to do it with her ? Yes why not ? She likes me and I like to reciprocate and show her how grateful I am for that. 
So we have planned to have our first date in a hotel room where the whole intention is to get physical. 
Is this a bad thing to do on a first date ? Should we do something else instead ? She's definitely interested in being in a relationship with me but I want to take it slow on the commitments part. Do I want to be in a committed relationship with this girl ? I don't know. 
Can you folks kindly advice if we should do something else on our first date ?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o8h2ui/my_tinder_date_have_planned_to_have_sex_on_our/
