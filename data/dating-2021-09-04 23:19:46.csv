1,pi6f52,1630816170,wanting a relationship but then getting cold feet as one begins,"TLDR, have not beein in a relationship for 3 years. as much as I fantasize about getting in one, I am now super stressed about it. many issues why.   


I havent been with a woman for 3 years 40+ 

had to get over the ex (still not over her)

 then financial troubles (got into debt moving to the ex's town, couldnt find enough work. I will never follow my heart again. he is stupid. so couldnt date because you need money to date. you cant go on walks or eat ice cream every date. you need money to date.

&amp;#x200B;

the last 15 months with covid, I lost my career and had to work as a night security guard which broke me mentally/emotionally. I was also too embarassed to tell any woman I did this fora job. its like going from store manager to washing dishes. . its a hard mental blow.

&amp;#x200B;

now im chatting with a few women at once (never had an issue there) and one whos taken interest and that ive taken interest in. now im getting frozen feet

&amp;#x200B;

1 shes super tall. like 5'11' amazonian tall. and 2 she is 10 years younger. I almost always dated my age or older. and I never dated a tall woman. my friend told me he felt emasculated when he did. I hope Ill be ok, but I never have so cant know till its go time. 

&amp;#x200B;

more the issue is Im trying to pace myself with going out. it costs money and this month we have less work and I need to move so I cant be spending excessively.  


wanting so badly a relationship, but not being in it for a long time, it now scares me when its go time. I went on 2 dates but I had a lot of work (money)and I felt very confident. this month I will struggle. and yes you need money to date. the women want to go here and there and here and there costs money. thats fact. 

&amp;#x200B;

how do I tell her without telling her that I can only date once a week going out to restaurant or outing? I need to pace myself. I was in this situation where the women wanted to go out 2-3 times a week and my wallet got thin very quickly. I panicked and just broke things off because of this.  and once you start dating, you cant tell them youre going to pause everything because the wallet need to reheal. it just keeps going. 

she is free to meet often (her work gives her free time) and she knows that my career is going to be slower because this month there are many holidays so less work, so I cant tell her im super busy with work. im quite free. and especially in the beginning they want to be impressed. instead of whipping out my wallet, what if I juggle for them. would that be good enough entertainment for a date?

&amp;#x200B;

I kinda push accelerating my involvement with the kids and informing them that we are dating- and she is so anxious about that. She wants to wait until custody is resolved in court (mid October).

I don’t want to be pushy because I know that ultimately it is her choice, but I have feelings too- and I’m anxious about it all too, I feel a little left out of the decision making and I feel like it matters if we are building a life together…

Most boys just wanna get in girls pants or care about the wrong things, yeah they get girls, and way more girls than the nicer boys do. But those girls won’t stay. I don’t care about girls bodies, I don’t care about sex or even want sex, I don’t want to use them, I hate the thought of that. Every time I was trying to impress my crush before I found out she was gay (totally different story lol) all I wanted to do was make her smile. When she would laugh my whole day was better.

13,pi78qo,1630820002,Realizing I deserve love &amp; happiness after healing childhood wounds,"35f As simple as that sounds, we all tell ourselves we deserve that, right? But sometimes not always. Sometimes that tiny inner voice inside us tells us we don't.

And we try to ignore it but its there in our subconscious &amp; its a quiet voice yet its causes huge consequences &amp; so much pain bc its what causes us to doubt ourselves &amp; let fear creep in &amp; then we end up ruining potential relationships.

I'd never received love the way I should have growing up. Coming from a broken home, as much as I wanted real love, I always ended up in abusive one-sided relationships. I could never understand why if people think I'm beautiful, why I couldn't feel it deep in myself? 

And why did I not believe I deserved love?....Bc my family never made me feel loved or worthy. They always made me feel like a mistake or an inconvenience. They also made me feel like I wasn't good enough bc they were ""fair skinned"" &amp; I was mixed with olive skin....my own relatives made me feel this way. 

It wasn't until recently after a v painful breakup, I just had enough of being used, mistreated, and lied to. I found a good therapist &amp; was determined to get to the bottom of my problems. While I'm nowhere near ""cured"" I have gotten to a place where I'm no longer attracted to men who mistreat me. I'm also no longer repelled by men who treat me right bc I'm not thinking he has some ulterior motive like it happened to me in the past. I don't feel as threatened by men &amp; guarded &amp; I don't know why I did before? Maybe my upbringing?

I went out with a guy recently &amp; he was real nice, a gentleman. He just did all these small things I never realized were important to me that say so much about how to be treated like a lady. We didn't end up dating but it set a blueprint for the kind of qualities I want (even more) in a partner. 

I've just had this fear of getting really close to someone bc I'm afraid they won't like what they see &amp; they'll leave &amp; this has happened before &amp; its hard to trust again but I'm trying to learn to love again &amp; I'm learning to really love myself.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pi78qo/realizing_i_deserve_love_happiness_after_healing/

1.  My first date was a couple weeks ago and I thought we hit it off over the messages.  We agreed on a time and place for a date, I confirmed with her about 45 minutes prior and she confirmed back.  Got there and no one showed up.  Sent a message at 15 minutes.  Silence.  Sent a message at 30 minutes.  Silence.  Was about to get up and leave at 45 and she sent a message saying, ""You're sweet ❤️ Nothing that you need to worry about.  Just dealing with some personal stuff right now, non of it related to dating.""  We talked some more after this and got the sense she was super self centered and I have no interest being with someone toxic like that.
2. Hit it off with another lady, conversation was really flowing and I was feeling good.  6 hours before the date she said she's looking to get together just as friends.  (Prior to this, everything was flowing with romantic interest).  Then right before I was about to respond, she sent another message saying that she wouldn't be able to make it any more because a family thing just came up.  She later clarified that she used to be mormon, her mom found out that she doesn't want to be mormon, then it sounds like an agreement was made to give it another month with the church and didn't want to be dating anyone who wasn't mormon...

15,pi7bn5,1630820366,Considering breaking up with new bf(M32) because I(F28) am holding red flags,"I recently began a long distance relationship with a man I really like. We met in person, but I had to move across the country to my hometown because I have financial issues I need to work through.

We really hit it off. I've never liked anyone more than I like him. I'm even the one who asked to be in a relationship. When we talk, I feel seen and heard, and as if I've always known this person. He's very empathetic and intelligent, and I find him to be an inspiring influence in my life. This is a drastic difference from my previous relationships.

However, I have a lot of issues that I'm becoming increasingly aware of. I've been working on self awareness over the course of a year, but since meeting him it's like there's a spotlight on my brain. I see TONS of issues I have. 

These issues are: 1. Liking him so much, and being long distance, I feel much more clingy than I have with previous partners. Suddenly I'm back in 9th grade and pining for someone. This looks like high anxiety, being afraid when hours pass with out a text, going back and forth on the idea of giving gifts, second guessing everything I do. This has been the easiest to manage, and he and I have even discussed it. Once he reminded me that he really is interested in me, most of that worry left. When it does occasionally creep up, I remind myself that he already expressed his interest in me, and it subsides. 2. Realizing to what degree I've been allowing previous trauma to run my life, which I need to fix as my entire life is in shambles because of it. I have an estranged husband who I have not seen or communicated with in years, but I only filed for divorce last year and I'm in the middle of it. It took me so long to file because the thought of possibly having any interaction with my legal husband sends me into fight or flight, and anything bureaucratic stresses me out to the point that I avoid it entirely. On top of this I have an expired driver's license I'm working on renewing, but need my marriage certificate for it (husband kept that on purpose to continue his work towards a greencard), yet need a license to get the certificate. 3. I'm totally broke. I'm paying bills this week and might not eat. I do have a job, but it's awful. 

I told my bf I was divorced, because in my heart I am. But legally is a different story and I need to be honest about it. I need to be honest about all of this. And I think that I'm a giant walking red flag. He doesn't deserve to be in a relationship with someone who has so much to work on. He deserves to be with someone he can build life with who is capable of taking care of themselves, and I'm not there yet, even though I want to be.

Does this warrant a break up? Or should I be open and see how he reacts? To a degree, I might be attempting to break up first due to fears of rejection.

But deep down inside I don't feel particularly happy with her, I don't feel necessarily attracted to her anymore. We've had our ups and downs before and I've broken up with her once and almost broke up with her two more times prior to that, I've told her that I don't think we should continue anymore and I don't think it would be healthy for us but she's very persistent on wanting to continue a relationship going as far as not even upsetting me and doing everything she can to make me happy. Now don't get me wrong I really appreciate that and honestly I really like that but I feel like the feeling of having me isn't going to go away even if she does nice things for me. And I feel like it's unhealthy for me to feel like this and still continue on not to mention not good for her as all the things that she does for me are essentially almost for nothing if I don't feel the same way for her.

I honestly don't want to waste her time anymore with how I'm feeling but I do you feel like she's just really stubborn and is probably more concerned of being single again than anything. And sadly this feeling that I've been having has been with me for two maybe three months and I haven't really had any time to talk to anyone since she's always there with me every single day and I don't really have an opportunity 2 talk to someone else about it. She even wants to come with me to work since I work as a delivery driver and it's actually kind of easy for me to bring people with me.

He was also in the process of selling their home they lived in and happened to be moving to a different location closer to me. So basically he strung me along for 2 or 3 days about not knowing what to do and he said he needs time and he doesn't know who he is etc. He finally sent me a text message:

20/05/2021 - '

***The last 5 months have been nothing short of incredible. I truly believe god bought you into my life and you have effected me in such a positive way, I have never been cared for or nurtured like that except maybe at times by my mother. You are such a beautiful and precious soul and I’ve always said it and ill stand by it, you are a 1 in a million!!! I know it may be hard to hear at first, but my feelings for you have always come directly from my heart. I know this path is not following the way we dreamt things would go, but regardless what path we take or what the outcome is, I meant it when I said that I love you! You’ve been at the forefront of my mind and my emotions and theres barely been a day we haven’t spoken in the last 5 months. There’s been moments with you that I would say is the happiest I’ve ever been! You are just so pure and my intentions with you were all the same! I hold you in such high regard, you are so worthy of loyalty and respect.***

***When we got together all those months ago I remember thinking how did I get so lucky, how can someone accept me with all my mess and trauma. All my ideals about relationship and partnership had been shattered and I was doing my best to pull it all together thinking that I don’t want to miss out on this rare gem that I couldn’t believe existed and was keen on me. At the time I didn’t realise, but looking back I unintentionally created a place in my mind that I jammed all my deepest hurts and didn’t allow myself to keep chipping away at it all.***

***I think there were times I knew I was struggling but I was avoidant in fear of tearing open the wounds again. After going to the show last weekend and in a matter of 2 days having 3 stressful encounters + the river one the week before, it was all just too much and it ruptured something inside of me.. I went to church Sunday morning in search of some respite and ended up in tears down the front after the service and had old mate ben praying for my healing. I knew right there, but again tried to fight it. I need to overcome these trials in my life, and I need to do it alone. Its not fair that anyone should have to carry the weight of my trauma. I know I said that I wanted to be a team and that we can overcome things together, and believe me I meant all of those things! But as life goes on we learn, grow and change. I know that if I don’t confront myself in this part of my life ill drag this mess with me and anyone that I’m in contact with for years to come. I can’t and I won’t do that to you, I value you too much!***

***I appreciate every bit of joy you have brought into my life and if this is where it ends I will not look on this with a negative eye. This has been one of the most beautiful encounters a man could ever ask for!***

***I promise to give you whatever time or space you need.. and I will totally respect if this doesn’t sit right with you. But once things settle down a little I would like to meet somewhere to talk things over. I will continue to pray for you and for your future. I hope you can forgive me for what has happened and know that I will always care for you!''***

2 weeks later i didn't hear anything further from him and sent a desperation message stating i will wait for him etc. He replied with\*:\* ***we will meet up and talk soon when were both available (he was in the midst of moving). Another two weeks later he reached out and asked if i wanted to catch up for coffee within a month, week, or so whatever is good for me.***

I didn't reply so he sent another message stating '***if i dont hear from you, i will drop your stuff to your house'***

I replied and said ***'you can keep the stuff or donate it and i don't think catching up for coffee is a good idea but hope is well'.***

(This is the time where i saw that he's been liking all these girls bikini/sexy on instagram)

He replied with: ***I guess this is it for good then, i know you will achieve anything in front of you!***

I didn't reply. Nekk minute we are all in lockdown and 2 months after No Contact he reaches out and says"" ***I don't expect a reply but i just wanted to say i hope you are safe and hanging in there with such harsh restrictions***.

As a man, what should I do about being below average looking and being around 5 feet tall? It used to bother me when I was a kid but it doesn’t as much anymore. I go online reading women’s comments on social media and they all discuss their turnoff about a short mans height.

I tried Online dating as well, I match with a girl, get along with them, they ask me for my height, I respond and the next day I’m blocked/deleted or “we should be just friends”.

I need some good advice, no hate for me believing what I believe, I will not push my ideology on you. (I don’t hate women btw)

I’m single and never had a girlfriend, but I had a few friends that were girls, they are honest with me and say if I was taller they’d be willing to date me, I’m lost and don’t know what to do.

From the minute we started liking each other, we were inseparable. We have had the once every other month fight, but in general, we are happy and in love and are planning a future together. It’s been amazing to see him grow in the last two years from not having secured a job post college to becoming an expert in his field. 

Anyway, I am worried he is the one. We are both so young and haven’t had another serious significant other. We both had sexual experiences before and short-lived gf/bf in high school, but we have mostly been discovering dating together. I guess I’m concerned that we don’t know anything else and that we may not be able to see yellow or orange flags if they exist because we are each other’s first.

Is this a normal thing to be worried about if your first serious partner seems like the one?

He asked me what changes I would like to see in the relationship (whatever we have). And I told being more consistent and being there for each other (sometimes he has been hot and cold).

I’ve had some one night stands from Tinder, but that’s it. I haven’t dated a lot but I’m working on that and in the past 2 years I’ve had two dates. 

The first, I went out with a girl from Tinder. We had two dates and though I was confident in a friendly respect, I was pretty shy when it came to more intimate things, so we never kissed. After the second date she said she just wanted to be friends. I was extremely upset by this and it took me months, nearly a year, to get over the rejection. This was despite the fact that we had only spoke/dated for 3-4 weeks max! 

A few weeks ago, I asked a girl from work out. We went on one date, kissed twice (but I could tell she wasn’t too into it), and the next day she texted me saying we should just be friends. It’s been just over a week since she said that, and I still feel really upset by it. It just makes me feel like I’m never right for anyone, and if someone does eventually like me, it’ll be because I had to settle after everyone else I was interested in rejected me. This seems weird to me because I only spoke to this girl for about 2 weeks before our date? So again, not even one month’s worth of investment. 

Im texting a girl from Bumble right now and she’s really attractive and nice, but I still keep wishing the girl from work would message me saying she changed her mind lol. 

How do I stop taking these rejections so hard? I keep thinking about how things could have been if the last girl had liked me, and feeling bad about it.

54,pibpdu,1630842624,"Anxiety (overthinking, trying to predict everything, etc) when dating - coping strategies?","Hi, people!  


I suffer from GAD and have pretty bad abandonment issues. I literally freak out whenever my friends (whom I've known for years and know would never leave me) don't answer their phones. I'm in therapy (for this and other stuff) but it's a slow process.  


My issue is - my anxiety goes through the roof whenever someone is not answering my texts. And since I know that isn't normal, I wouldn't like to bother other people with it, so I really don't want advice such as ""well, tell them you need more communication"" because that would be asking another person to tend to my irrational fears.  
I'm currently in a casual ""relationship"" (casual things are not for people with anxiety, but I'm really enjoying it most of the time and don't want it to end), meaning we both are free to see other people. However, as much as I'm rationally okay with that, it seems that emotionally I'm not. Since whenever I don't hear from a guy I start imagining how he's with someone else and he likes her much better than me and he'll want to end thing with me and fade me (nice guys don't ghost, they fade lol) and I won't even get it, so I'll keep reaching out, losing my dignity in the process. Then I get a text such as ""busy day at work"" and I calm down lol.  


What I came here to ask is not advice on the relationship itself (I know a lot of people will tell me I'm ""obviously not okay with casual and need to leave"", I respect that opinion, but in the past I have often sabotaged very nice things out of irrational fears and no, I don't want to leave the relationship, I want to learn how to relax about relationships). The definition of a relationship doesn't change my anxiety - I've had the same problem with guys who were very committed to me and never gave me any reason to suspect something bad will happen. So the problem is - me.   


What are some coping strategies? What do I tell myself in moments my mind begins to spiral and imagine the (negative) future?

The first date I met on a dating app. We met for drinks at a bar. He was very handsome in his pictures so I was a bit worried I was gonna get catfished. Luckily, I didn’t. He was very tall and I like tall guys and he could keep the conversation going. 

After a few hours, the date ended and when the bill came he suggested to split the bill. This was the first time I’ve had to split the bill on a first date. On the inside I was kind of shocked because it seems like the date was going well. I agreed even though I felt a little confused and then as we stood up to leave he hugs me and then leaves out. Not waiting for me and not walking me to my car. Maybe he didn’t offer because I was talking about my experience with creepy guys hitting on me at work. Or maybe he didn’t pay or walk me out because he wanted to come home with me and hook up. I can’t tell. And in no way am I entitled to not paying and I always offer to split initially. But the guys I’ve went on dates with in the past always insisted on paying. 

Anyways, as I’m walking out a guy sitting at the bar waves me down and starts complimenting me. He starts calling me beautiful and complimenting my outfit. I’m trying to leave but he keeps talking to me and the guy I was originally with is long gone. He starts asking me what my name is and where I’m from. Usually, I would brush it off and keep going but he seemed harmless.

I was feeling a bit weird after the first guy didn’t pay so when he offered to buy me a drink I said yes. We talked about school and work for about 30 minutes before the bar closed. He walked me to my car and we exchanged numbers. He’s from another state so I don’t think we’ll ever meet again but that encounter was really surprising. And I consider myself a bit of an introvert so the fact that I even went on 2 dates is out of character for me.

TLDR: Went on 2 dates in one night. First guy I met from a dating app. Second guy was a random guy that approached me as I was walking out. My self esteem definitely increased after last night.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pic55q/went_on_2_dates_in_1_night/

It is my final year of high school and I want to try to be with someone since I feel like I might not have as much of a chance getting a girl after I graduate depending if I decide to go to college or not or do military and what job I go for too and I want a real friend that I can talk with.

I saw this cute girl in one of my classes and her vibe or something attracted me, seems quiet like me. 1st day of school I thought to myself meh she probably is just some girl that I think is cute like other girls in my other classes but then I think about her specifically and now I feel like I should probably do something now but I have no idea what to do.

I really want to talk and get to know her but idk if I can because of seating arrangements because of Covid and I'm pretty sure I can't just sit next to her or else the teacher will just call me back to my seat even if there is free time, also I never see her outside the class nor lunch or I probably haven't payed attention. I am so extremely unexperienced with talking with girls and people in general because I have never actually had friends to talk, hang or text my entire school life and I'm introverted so the idea of walking up to a girl that I've never met or seen before and trying to make convo seems extremely weird to me and I get anxiety especially if the class is quiet.

So what should I do? I am so scared and nervous, I've got proper hand gesture, eye contact and able to be composed but I don't exactly know what to do and say.

I asked him what day his birthday is, because I knew he was a Libra and ""wasn't it October 17th?"". He answered that text, but I noticed that he was confused and like ""wtf is wrong with her?"". After a few more gulps of liquid courage I sent him another text and said that I was sorry for trying to flirt in such a miserable way. That one he never answered. Of course. I wouldn't either. 

Now! We aren't dating. He seems like a flirty guy but I don't think he has any interest in me. In every other text he sends me a ""heart"" emoji or a ""&lt;3"", but I don't know what he is trying to do with that. I wanted to talk about our situation but he always shuts down or barrel-rolls out of these situations. 

I am 89,5% sure he doesn't like me that way. But now I feel like I've messed it up entirely by being a gigantic dork. Who wants to date someone who doesn't have proper chat, exciting banter?

Everything went well until the check came and he suggested to split the check. I said sure and split it with him but on the inside I was shocked and confused. Every other first date I’ve gone on in the past the guy insisted on paying. Even when I offer to split they usually refuse. 

My question is what does it mean? Before the check came he asked what my plans were after this and I said I’m going home because I’m tired. I had just got off a long shift at work and I had to rush home to get ready. I’m not sure if the reason why he didn’t pay is because he wanted to come over or hook up. 

I am bad at noticing red flags right away so I wonder if this is one of them. I wonder if he only wants sex and when he didn’t get it he didn’t pay. I heard from guys that guys pay to impress you into bed or it’s because they like you and want to keep seeing you.

I am in no way saying every guy should pay on the first date. I am totally capable of paying for myself and I always bring my wallet.

There were several red flags, which I’ll go over, but the biggest one was this:

At some point during a conversation, they both talked angrily and endlessly about a great opportunity they had missed out on because someone who deserved it less got it.

Both of these men were in their early 30s, and the opportunity was right when they were out of college, so over ten years ago.

In my life, of course I’ve lost out on opportunities because of unfair reasons, but I almost never think about them because I have built up a lot of success since. It would never occur to me to talk about them.

There were some other orange and red flags, like the supposedly successful businessman who lived in a student housing apartment with a roommate. He also couldn’t pay for my coffee and forgot his wallet sometimes on dates. If you’re 31, and so successful, shouldn’t you be making moves to buy a house or condo? 

Someone doesn’t have to make a lot of money, but they need to live within their means, be generally fiscally responsible, and have goals that they’re successful in working towards.

During my last visit with her she told me this, 

“OP, I want you to consider this. Right now the girls in your age group aren’t looking for anything serious. They aren’t looking for a partner. They’re looking for fun with guys that they don’t take seriously. You’re more than that. You’re a serious partner that will be great for any woman. You’re likely be a lot more successful if you just wait a few years before entering the dating scene, for now it might be better for you to forget about girls and sex. When you’re nearly 30 and the girls around have decided that they want something serious.”

A week and a half after the fight, I find him on tinder with a new bio stating his dick length, that he’s “passionate dominant and affectionate” and a “pleaser ;)”. Ironic because when I asked if he was on tinder while we were still speaking, he said no because he hates the mundanity of having the same surface level conversations with everyone he matches.

I’m just looking for some explanation as to how someone can jump on tinder so quick when they had feelings for someone and also make their bio so sexually suggestive as if they’re desperately trying to move on and fuck tons of girls.

I feel like there were many situations where she gave the impression that she was interested in me. Even though I wanted to ask her on a date, I either had a lot of work to do or couldn't meet her due to quarantine restrictions in my country. The last time I saw her during one of those meetings, we spend some time apart from the group and talked for some time when she told me she was going to study abroad for 6 months. We texted a little bit aber that about casual topics, inside jokes, etc. and then I asked her how her preparation was going and that I really enjoy spending time with her and that I want to meet her to grab some food before she departs (3 weeks later).

She replied with some issues she had in her preparation and how stressed she was because of that. Then she told me she would also like to meet me one last time ... and the other group members.

I immediately perceived it as a rejection that she does not want to go on a date with me but only wants to meet me in a group. My best friend (who doesn't know her) also advised me to simply move on and ignore her texts and being ""hurt"" I agreed with that. The next evening I met another friend and at some point we talked about women, dating, ... and also brought up this topic. In his opinion, she probably understood I was asking her out but didn't want to date me right now. Even though she didn't actually say 'yes', she didn't say 'no' either. So I thought about it for a while and changed my mind from ignoring her texts to offering some support and replied 2 days later.

However, She didn't even open the chat for like 4 days and left me on read afterward.

90,pieyn4,1630855147,Looking for signals to use to let crush know I'm interested,"Hey so I'm a 17M and I've been invited to a bday party next friday. Crush (17F) will be there as well and I want to take this occasion to try and see how things would work out, if she's interested etc.

I've been texting her in the past few days and everything seems to go good, but now that I'll finally see her in presence after a while I want to make her know I'm interested in that way.

I just don't know what's the best way tho, I don't know what signals would be the best to see if there's the interest. Anyone knows good signals to use? Maybe some flirting strategies? A method to break the physical barrier in a smooth way?

Also if it can help, at the party there will be cocktails and etc.

Thanks in advance!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pieyn4/looking_for_signals_to_use_to_let_crush_know_im/
91,piez7h,1630855201,My girl left me because I couldn’t give her certainty.,"Hi guys. I am a 26(M), and my Girl was 27(F).  We have known each other as students from our college. She was my senior, but we never were friends during those years. She is a beautiful girl, and I was interested in her during those years. 

We met after our college finished, and after persistently roaming around her, I asked her for a casual relationship(since we both were damaged through several relationships). 

We were exclusive, and over the period of two years, we started developing feelings towards each other.

The past few months have been hard for us. I moved out of the country, and she repeatedly said that we could see it through. However, I had my doubts as she wouldn’t have moved for at least another year.

She said that we should see other people, but I became a clingy man and always told her I want her but never really got into a relationship. I think I have relationship/commitment phobia.

I shared my feelings with a friend, and he pushed me to tell her. With a bit of a request, she said yes. However, after two days, I chickened out. She said she would not trust me again, but we kept in touch for a few months. 

Recently, she told me that she has moved on. She cherishes what we had, but now this is becoming toxic for her. The past few months have been eye-opening for me as well. I realized how fucked up a hypothesis I have on life.

I did beg her not to go away, but she has made her mind, and she is asked me for space. I went a little loony at times when she ignored me and told me that she is seeing someone else.

She was very straight/mean with me the last time we spoke. She told me she has moved on in the previous few months, and she is not returning to what it was.

I was very hurt, and I realize it was my fault. I haven’t texted or called her, temporally disabled my insta, so I don’t see her stories. 

I do love her and would want her to be happy. Should I let her go?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/piez7h/my_girl_left_me_because_i_couldnt_give_her/

We have been working on the same project in uni and at least I felt that we had great chemistry. But then there is the stigma being the the girl isn't supposed to be taller than the guy, so would I just make a fool out of myself? Its weird because I've never been interested a girl taller than me, but do you think she is mainly looking for guys that are 190cm+?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pig76r/asking_a_tall_girl_out_are_odds_against_me/
