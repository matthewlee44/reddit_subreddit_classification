I'm fit, fun, funny, and good looking. My issue isn't getting matches with equivalently spec'd female counterparts. But rather finding someone who wants more than a hookup or casual dating thing.

Tinder is cool for casual stuff. But legitimately what do I have to do to find someone who wants more than just my body and is also within 1 standard deviation of average? 

Tinder gets matches that lead to nothing beyond casual. Bumble is a ghost town. Hinge results in matches but I don't think I've swiped on an attractive woman in days (I'm not trying to be rude and my standards are fairly modest... it's like 1 in 20 or 30 that is even average compared to the average woman I see walking around irl). Okc and pof are just bots basically dead apps if you're under 30 I think.

I wouldn't necessarily care except that I have to work nights for the foreseeable future so online dating has become prime, and covid is still technically a thing and even if I didn't care about going to large public gatherings (I can't afford even a small chance of getting sick) lots of traditional irl meeting places are still being restricted regardless.

I also don't have a friend group anymore since I had to move because of covid and like I said it's been rough on that front too. So what's the dealio? What do theses apps want.

Essentially, status is a behavior, skill, or personal trait that demonstrates excellence or power, and garners the attention and respect of others. While a good job and wealth is undoubtedly a form of status, it is not the only form.

Some examples: having a good job, being highly skilled or knowledgeable in your job, having a substantial social network, a good reputation within a social demographic, the ability to convey success with the opposite sex, commanding attention of groups through public speaking or performance.

Status is inherently attractive because it conveys to the other person that you do not need them for validation or fulfillment, that you can have a fulfilling life with or without them. This is the antithesis of a needy, unattractive individual who derives their self worth and happiness from their relationship. People  will often deny status is a factor in the context of attraction because they don’t want to appear shallow. However, in simple terms, status means that the other person brings something to the table in the relationship.

It’s important to note that even if you a display excellence, you also have to be aware and believe you are a person of status. This is critical. Many high achieving people still believe they are unworthy to be in the presence of someone who’s physically attractive.

She wants to meet new people, she wants to understand what she wants, she said that for a long time life was always the same to her, and she feels lost.

I started talking to this guy, he’s a cop which I thought was great because I’m weirdly attracted to male cops. I told him I’d love to talk to him because that’s my future career so I wanted to get some insights. 

So we exchanged numbers. He asked if he could come over after he got off work if u still wanted to talk. I said yes, which should have recognized was the first red flag cause it was after midnight. 

He came over in uniform which I was gushing about because I find it very attractive. He showed me all the stuff he had on his belt and let me try in his vest. It was going very well so far. We got to talking about things, getting to know you stuff, the basics and he was telling me about the job. 

He then asked me if he could kiss me, he said that he thought I was really attractive. Deep down I was hoping that things wouldn’t not go south because I was really enjoying his company. I gave in because I’m kinda a pushover that way. He then got really honest and said that he wanted to have sex with me. 

I was very disappointed, I was hoping to bot continue this cycle. I should have known when he asked me what I was looking for. I told him something serious and his response was that he was fine with whatever happened. 

So I’m sitting here, after he told me what he wanted and Im eventually able to get the words out and tell him I couldn’t. He asked me why and wanted me to explain my reasoning behind it. I told him I was very traditional in a sense that I believe that having sex should be reserved for people in relationships. People who love each other ( this might be controversial for some). He told me that he wasn’t a total stranger and that regardless if what happened that night he would come back.  

I thought his response was weird but I told him I couldn’t do it. We talked a little more before he decided to leave. I was sure I wouldn’t see him again it was very clear to me what he wanted. But he’s been texting me ever since. I’m a little confused, is he still trying to get laid or maybe he’s genuinely interested I’m not sure.

This is actually my first ever public post on Reddit so here's hoping it goes well. 

I have never been on a date. I am a pretty normal, sociable guy who has a few friends, used to go to a decent amount of parties and other social gatherings (I'm not really doing that now because of the massive university workload) I like to think that I am a decent-looking man, with a few attractive features. However, I have never taken a girl on a date. I also never been in any relationship with a woman. Obviously, I had a few female friends throughout my life, however for some reason I never really tried to push these relationships further. It's not like I've been friendzoned by them either, I have a strong suspicion that maybe some of them wanted it as well, and left making that first step to me. However I never stepped out of my comfort zone in this regard.

I had some intimate contacts with girls before, I kissed a few in the clubs etc. However for some reason I was again incapable of making the next step, of reaching out to them the next day, and asking for a date in order to get to know each other better etc. And I heavily regret that in some cases. 

I'm saying all of this because I'm reaching a point in my life where plenty of my mates are in stable relationships, whereas I'm stuck in this weird position where I seem to be doing OK in my life, however I do feel that weird void and I don't know how to go on about breaking out of my comfort zone and asking a girl on a date. And there are two or three out there that I like, but don't know how to develop healthy and enjoyable relationships with them.

First date he came to my town. 2nd I went to his. Through out and in between he was great with communication, consistent and very interesting (sorta pushy). Highly intelligent, emotionally too, well read, manages a team of people at a fairly large tech company in NYC, and I could see myself talking to him about life, politics, personal development, almost anything years down the line. However, he’s a man and men need sex and sex always makes things complicated for me. As in, I’ve only had two partners and I’m 31. So sleeping around just for fun really isn’t something I’m into. 

For the 2nd date, we had dinner, bar for drinks and for a couple of weeks before he kept saying his place is finally ready and he’d love for me to see it etc (he recently moved ). Normal guy stuff but I know what that also meant. So when, during the 2nd date, he suggested we go back to his place, I said I wouldn’t mind but that I wasn’t comfortable doing anything physical, just hanging out and talking (maybe making out)  I told him this before we went into his apartment so that he wouldn’t be disappointed. The last time I went to a guys (someone else) place and told him I wasn’t ready for sex, he got angry. I didn’t want to risk that happening again. 

So I tell this guy and his mood changes, not because I say I’m not ready for sex but because he thinks I’ve ruined the mood by telling him outside his apartment. He said if felt like a rejection and it was like a turn off for him.  

Long story short, we go back to his place, we make out, don’t have full on sex, but do the other stuff (at the point I was stressed by his disappointment and just wanted make everything ok - also being alone  in an apartment with a guy you’re attracted to meant something was bound to happen). 

He perked up right away when we got into the making out, touching, etc etc but there were underhanded comments made about how he found it weird that we weren’t going all the way, like “is this what they call sex now a days” and he also mentioned that when he has sex he likes to have it without a condom because he trusts the girls he’s with. He told me that whe  He was with his ex of 5 years he only had sex with her without a condom and used the pull out method the whole time. He felt that if a girl is on birth control there’s even more reasoning to not use a condom. He did this with someone he’d dated for 3/4 months because she said she was clean. 

I’m glad I left his place not having had sex with him, all the way, as in penetrative sex  But man i know there’s a lot off with this dude.

Second date we did a nature walk which I had suggested and planned, we seemed to have a wonderful time and I felt like there was something there, we seemed to get along, it just felt completely natural and we had heaps of fun. We felt really happy and both was organising for a third date. We even said we had a wonderful time together many times.

Unfortunately due to living in Australia, we had to ensure with months long lockdowns and at that time she was hesitant to go out (kinda subtly told her I would even use the partner excuse to be able to see each other). This was literally just a few days after our date.

Anyway during this time we talked every day and we seemed to get along very well, chatting and looking out for each other through a difficult time. A joke here and there to keep our spirits up.

During that time she told me she would like to try out a particular sport, i organised everything so that everything would run smoothly (booking equipment and space).

Felt like we had a good time playing, both of us improved significantly (not too hard when you're starting from 0). Neither of us are the best, far from it obviously but it was good improvement.

I was slightly better so spent some time teaching her as well. Thought it was good to help each other get better, and we have heaps of activities in common.

After we had dinner and had a wonderful conversation as usual. Talking about everything under the sun. At the end of the date I msged her that I had a wonderful time together and liked her and would like to see her again.

Radio silence. Not sure what happened there as I thought we had a good thing going. Finding someone who you feel like you really have a connection with is hard as it is, it really hurts for it to be this way. 

I guess she didn't feel it. I'm finding it's hard to keep the dates going after so long apart, even though you put in all the effort to keep them alive because you want to see each other again.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1082463,public,self,Ghosted after third date,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qc7f1s/ghosted_after_third_date/,all_ads,6,,

I (36M) met this gal (31F) via Tinder. I tend to move fairly fast on the apps to sort through the perpetual texters and those just window shopping. I am looking for a LTR (previously married, but looking to be again some day) and make that very clear both in my profile and when I get to know a person.

So after a day or so of chatting on Tinder, we exchange numbers and take it offline. Within the first day of texting I asked if she would be interested in going out and she accepted. I had to be out of town for a few days, but we went out to dinner the evening I got back. Dinner was great, good conversations and awesome kiss at the conclusion of the evening. For some background she is an emergency nurse and a single mother of one, so has very limited time, which I understand.

The next ""date"" she came over to my place after a shift. She slept on the couch while I prepped and cooked dinner. We ate, we talked and eventually ended up in bed together. All together a very beautiful evening. It was very intimate and I felt very connected. The next time we saw each other was maybe 3 days later and I met her daughter and father at an outdoor event, spent the afternoon walking, talking, playing with the kid, holding hands and feeling amazing. During that outing I was playing a game with her daughter on her phone and a text came up. While I didn't read it all, there was enough there to know it was from someone that she had definitely slept with/been sleeping with. I didn't say anything at the time as we'd been seeing each other a few weeks at this point, but it made me pretty unhappy TBH. I dropped it. The next major event was an overnight trip with her, her daughter and dog to a autumn festival/craft thing. Again had a great time, and felt very much like a family - even though it was relatively early I was catching real feelings and considering her behavior and access to her child, I assumed all was the same with her. After getting home from the trip we were sitting on the couch watching a movie and another text came up. I didn't see the contents, but that it was from the same person. It really deflated me and made me feel very stupid/insecure about letting myself go so far.

Eventually, it ate me up enough that I brought it up to her. I let her know that I wanted and thought that we were in a exclusive relationship, given the nature of things. She said she agreed, but then I brought up the texts and she backpedaled a bit and noted that he was a DOM (kinda blew my mind a bit) that she was involved with recently and still checked in with her from time to time, but she cut it off as it wasn't a great situation. Ever since then things have been a bit strained and feeling very chilly. We had a nice dinner at my brothers a few days ago, but other than that it has been really tepid and communication has waned to a trickle. I brought it up the other day and she basically said that the more that I push the more she is going to pull away...I am not sure that is how relationships are supposed to work. I am hurting a bit right now and trying to figure out if I am screwing this up or if she is dating more than one person and I just thought it was more than it was or what?

It’s my first time on Reddit so please excuse me if I accidentally violate some unwritten rules of Reddit.

So, I (male, 24) have a crush on sb (f, 25) since highschool. (We’re currently both studying at the same college.)

A few weeks ago, I gathered all my remaining courage (I’m a rather shy person) and asked her out for a date. She said yes, but I really had a bad timing on that day because one day later she went on holiday for two weeks, so we had to postpone it.

She wrote me a message right after she came back and she told me that she currently don’t want to be in a relationship because she made bad experiences with men over the last year. (Which I can totally understand.)

So, now my question: Is she just extremely polite and didn’t want to hurt my feelings and she actually never really wanted a date or am I just over… (reacting maybe? I’m sorry. I don’t find the right word at the moment.)

And most importantly, if everything was true, what should I do? I mean, I really do love her and I can wait (it’s not like I need a relationship, I’m happy right now with my life), but I don’t want to put her under pressure.

At the end of September I (20M) matched with this girl (20F) on tinder. We clicked but communication was spotty until we exchanged numbers. After that we were texting very consistently. I wanted to set a beach date for the upcoming Saturday. Saturday morning comes and she cancels for a family emergency. We reschedule for the following weekend to have a movie night at my place since it was going to be chilly and overcast. 

We FaceTime so I can instruct her on how to get to my room. Just from the sound of her voice I was more attracted. I meet her outside the building and show her inside, making small talk on the way up. As soon as I close the door to my room she drops a bomb. I didn't even get to take my hoodie off and she told me she has a baby. I was surprised this didn't come up in the last 2 weeks we've been talking. Regardless, as surprised as I was it didn't really matter to me because I was still attracted to her and wanted to get to know her. After talking for awhile I could tell we had some chemistry because she felt super comfortable around me, laughing, and smiling all that. In all that she told me she lied about the family emergency because she was nervous for our date. 

Fast forward to the movie, we're cuddling in my bed. One thing leads to another and we're making out. Things got really intense and we were getting really intimate. I stopped for a second and told her I didn't want to just hook up and be a one night stand. She told me she really wanted to go all the way. for the next hour or two, I change my mind. I really did want to sleep with her and there was no point in waiting because there was a chance I could get ghosted either way. I ended up sleeping with her and it was the best decision I could have made. 

When we finished I told her to let me know when she got home, and to have a good night. The next day I told her I had a good time and we should see each other again and she agreed enthusiastically. While I'm not looking for something super serious I still wanted to take her out and at least get to know her. So I suggest we hangout downtown that weekend . It was a pretty broad statement, but I didn't have anything specific in mind. As the week goes by her texts slow down and she apologizes for being busy. She asked what I wanted to do downtown, and I told her the time and place to get dinner at this Mexican spot. She agrees. The day comes and she tells me the baby is sick and she can't make it.

I noticed that she was texting me about once a day, and that was unusual. She told me she has a busy schedule, and I understand but she used to make time before. The whole week she was acting odd and was trying to reschedule because she thought my day would be too busy. So I asked if everything was okay and if she wants to continue seeing me due to how busy she is and how she's acting. She told me she doesn't know and thinks I want a relationship and its not that she doesn't want that but she's too busy. I told her that I didn't want a relationship and haven't heard back since Sunday (today being Wednesday). My conclusion is that I got ghosted.

Here you go! 

Although I did notice his beer belly when we first went on a bike ride, his fancy jersey and rear glasses somehow convinced me that he is as a proper cyclist as he claimed, or at least as a proper cyclist as every other man with cycling picture on their Tinder profile. 

Oh wait, we met actually on Hinge. But I guess it doesn’t matter. Only Pete found Chasten, so whether it’s Hinge, Tinder, or whatever, they are just the mutation of Grinder! 

Anyway, let’s back to our main story!

I naively believed he was a proper cyclist until he disclosed that he is actually retired from cycling, just like many other high school football couches whose beer belly is the signature!The glorious 55 miles/hr is the past. Now, he is just happy whenever he can sustain 5 minutes on the bed. I believe he is telling the truth. I was there when he ejaculated within one minute I got naked. I wish I could write my PhD dissertation as he did, my advisors would be thrilled!

I then realized his real identity might be the underground Donal Trump Junior. Not only he has small hands, but also his goal of life is to be a real estate mogul. He wanted to own at least six houses by 50 years old and he reached to the first milestone by the age 35! Additionally, he commented on me sexy all the time. This is sort of my AhHa moment. Im stupid most of time, but I’m not delusional that I am as sexy as Stormy Daniels. Although he never paid me “hush money”, I did save him a lot:  membership of PornHub, healthy sex buddy, and dinner! For the record, he would properly disagree on dinner. He might think he sacrificed his stomach though. Because he brought some wine for the dinner and brought back the leftover. I think he needed some alcohol to cover the bitterness of eating disgusting Asian fusion. 

At the end of the day, we both learned a lesson in a hard way: there’s no such thing as a free lunch, folks!

Howdy, people. I am in kind of pickle right now, honestly don't know what to do next. Basically, i(19M) decided to hang out with a sister of my friend(20F), at her house last week. The reason why i chose to tell her to hang out and not date is because 1)i felt nervous; 2)i just wanted to make connection with her, see if we have chemistry with each other and what not...

I was an asexual(not anymore,) and very introverted person before, but over the course of years i have been working on myself, physically and mentally and long time ago decided that i should work on myself before going to date anyone(that's why during my early teens i rejected the girls who were genuinely into me, some of those rejections i regret, some i do not, but thats not what this post is about).

...back to the week earlier. Right now i am more or less a confident guy, but as an overthinker, i couldn't get it out of my head that smth would definetly go wrong(imagining every worst case scenario and what not). But i soon came to conclusion that i have literally nothing-to-lose/everything-to-gain and getting rejected is far better outcome than sit and wait in action(before you guys comment about this, again its because i am an overthinker and not because i put this girl high on pedestal, i genuinely try my best to be my authentic self and not one of those ""nice guys"")

And after all of this thought process here comes that day and she invites me to her house. We started talking about various stuff, with me asking basic questions like ""What's your story?"", ""Tell me about your childhood, dreams, yada-yada"" to talking about different tastes in movies, video-games, music, what are you thinking about X thing and etc. I tried my best to make it avoid looking like some kind of interview/interrogation and i would just, listen to her talk(from time to time i would talk about myself, which i am not used to tbh but i could feel that she was genuinely listening). I was only focused on getting to knew her better and i felt that i no longer required this ""need"" to show off myself into some kind of persona that is not me. With my overthinking going out of the window, unexpectedly her mom comes early. I am more cool with adults anyways, so i introduced myself to her too. I also started talking and asking similar questions to her too, and i made instant friends with the momma. She even complimented me a few times, even calling me attractive, which i did not expect at all(i think its a clear parent thing to encourage/""embarrass"" their kids in front of their peers), but that already made me feel good. We said goodbyes, and girl said she was looking forward for meeting me again. It was a good day, and i learned a lot about myself.

Aaaaand, my question is? What should i do next? I am planning to meet her every week or so, but i clearly don't know what should i do? Being our first ""meeting"" ever, i did not flirt, escalate or do similar things for obvious reasons. Should i continue to get her know better? Should i do activities with her, escalate things? Should i go for the kiss, do it next time, or actually declare to date her? Or forget all of this nonsense like did the first time and let her make the moves?

Long post, i know but i need your opinion fellas. Stay safe and have a good week!
