5,pnghhe,1631543056,How to fix this relationship?," 

So, I‚Äôm in a bit of a bad way and can‚Äôt stop panicking. I (male, 33 years old) have been in a relationship with this guy (42 years old) for almost 2 years now. This was his first relationship. He came out about 6 years ago, and his parents reacted quite badly (his dad started crying and they didn‚Äôt talk about it again, and his mom just told him not to tell anyone else in the family). His sister (44) has never been in a relationship, which I‚Äôve always found strange. They both depend quite a lot on their parents, and until recently my boyfriend‚Äôs mom would do all his laundry/ironing and most of his cooking. She‚Äôd almost come to clean his flat, where we both live (I moved in a few months ago).

Anyway, since I met him, he has had a tendency to see things negatively. He basically doesn‚Äôt enjoy anything ‚Äì going out, his job (he‚Äôs a doctor), often I get the sense he doesn‚Äôt really enjoy our relationship. He kind of just seems neutral/negative about everything in life. He‚Äôs said a few times, jokingly, you‚Äôve complicated my life; life was much easier when I was single (which is basically his entire life). He‚Äôs always complained that we don‚Äôt have enough sex (it‚Äôs true, some weeks when we‚Äôve both been working lots, we‚Äôve only had sex once a week), and when we do, it doesn‚Äôt meet his expectations (he‚Äôs by no means a very sexual person, as you can imagine of someone who doesn‚Äôt get a lot of enjoyment out of life in general). He has also been hassling me to go to the gym, and he says I need more muscles for him to be properly attracted to me. My friends say he‚Äôs seen too many movies and doesn‚Äôt have any experience, so has completely unrealistic expectations (he also compares himself to everyone going).

Anyway, I‚Äôm from UK (we live in Spain) and want to go back, as my job prospects are dismal in Spain (I‚Äôm self employed and the conditions are horrendous). We‚Äôve talked about it, and he applied for a job at a hospital in England. He was offered the job and now just has to pass an English exam to get his license to practice, before starting. At the same time, he‚Äôs studying for a public exam to get a fixed-term position in Spain, as he says he doesn‚Äôt want to leave Spain without having a job to come back to (here, civil servants can leave and come back to a job with their name on it ha). Now he‚Äôs saying he can‚Äôt leave his family (btw, I can‚Äôt go their house when he goes because of his dad‚Äôs homophobia, so I feel like, I don‚Äôt have my family here, and can‚Äôt have a relationship with his either, which is shit). He literally is just thinking about his needs and I‚Äôm pretty sure that if he had to choose between carrying on working in Spain or our relationship (in the UK), he‚Äôd choose the former. I fact I‚Äôm almost positive, as not once has he said something like ‚Äúlet‚Äôs do this together‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat do you need?‚Äù, and just goes on and on about how he can‚Äôt leave his family, his apartment, his current hospital, etc. The way I work in relationships just isn‚Äôt like that ‚Äì I think a couple should be a team who embark upon projects together and are flexible in terms of the other‚Äôs needs. Maybe, I‚Äôm being unrealistic as well on that point, and that‚Äôs not how couples work.

Anyway, yesterday everything he looked at me, he‚Äôd kiss me and say ‚Äúsuch a shame‚Äù or something along those lines and look sad. Then yesterday, he said, he‚Äôll have to talk one day about where we‚Äôre going. So I‚Äôm now in a panic. I live with him in his flat, and I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs going to want to break up. Am I right in thinking it‚Äôs almost a given at this point that he will break up with me? Any other advice would be very greatly welcomed üòä.

\*\*\*

In the weeks after my ex unceremoniously ended our marriage of 25 unfailingly loyal (for me) years, my mind drifted back to some of the girls I'd dated in my 20s, before I met my ex. 

I thought of Megan, the kind and loving ""older"" woman (late 20s) who I dated my senior year in college for a few months and who I truly adored except I was just too young then to settle down into a permanent LTR like she wanted -- in those weeks after my marriage ended I wondered where Megan was, if she were happy, and what my life would have been like if I'd married her... I also thought back on my other college girlfriend, the partying and highly-sexual young woman I had liked soooo much but at a time when neither one of us was ready to settle down so broke it off after six months -- she was such a fun loving and easygoing person, did she end up with a life that kept her happy?...  I thought of Hayley, the 24 year old who was sooooooo extroverted and confident and funny, and who liked me so much, and who one night f\*cked my brains out nonstop for several hours like I'd never experienced before or since -- I'd heard from friend groups she still asked about me from time to time even though I hadn't seen her in over 25 years, and I wondered why it was that I broke up with her way back when?... And I yearned a bit for the exotic and mesmerizing South American woman I met while traveling where there was an incredible lightning bolt between us that we both felt and expressed but the distance got in the way -- should I have moved south to be with her like she had suggested? Would these people have treated me more kindly than my ex wife had, been more present than my ex wife had, been a lot more romantic and satisfying than my ex wife was, and would they have not ended a marriage so unkindly like my ex had? 

Thankfully these were all just fleeting thoughts/fancies as I dealt with the shock of 25 years ending, and I was in no way was at risk of looking them up. But after my wife of 25 years had somewhat abruptly decided she wanted a new life and a new path that didn't include her goofball (me) husband, I did wonder if I would have had a more satisfying adult life if I'd settled down with them rather than my charming-but-self-centered ex.

Meanwhile, I have several single friends in their 40s who desperately want to be married or in an LTR. Without exception, they all have a ""one that got away"" story which seems to become more pronounced and heavy with each unsuccessful dating experience and as the years go by. Sometimes, after an LTR ends, they'll start crying as they lament a person that they lost long ago. My terrific friend, who is single and 49, had a heartfelt cry while we were talking just a few months ago as she lamented over breaking up with a super nice but not handsome enough guy she loved in her early 20s -- she felt like if she'd just gotten over his lack of gorgeousness that she would have had a kind and loving adulthood without the relationship drama she's experienced over 20 years.

And I realize -- how much a curse the ones who got away are for us who are unexpectedly single or unhappy in middle life. They are specters who hover over us, whisper to us, gleefully convince us that we are miserable only because we made a huge mistake so many years ago or that we weren't good enough for them so many years ago, that the person we let get away (or who ran away from us) was our lost chance for a satisfying adulthood. That we are cursed to be unhappy in adulthood simply because that person slipped away from us.

For us romantics who yearn for true love, I'm starting to realize that it's so important to actually taint the memories of the ones who got away. To remember -- or fabricate -- their faults. For me, it would be that Megan was kind to me but also supercilious and thought she was wiser/better than me and was always giving me mini-lectures about life that was a turn-off for me. And that Hayley never ever stopped talking, and when she thought something was funny would repeat it over and over to me to the point that it was excruciating. And that she was so loud that she was sometimes embarrassing since other people would glance towards that loud voice. Or that the funloving young woman I dated in college had a veeeerrrrryyyyyy hard time with monogamy and that I ended things with her permanently after I'd already been suspecting she was cheating then learned from friends that she'd hooked up with a guy at a party (and then called me the next day without a care in the world as though it was just a regular day). 

Everyone has bad breath. Or annoying habits. And for the ones who got away, I think it's soooo important to exaggerate those in our memories. Because the reality is those specters -- who we make soooo lofty and perfect in our memories -- stand in the way of true contentment, even if we are single. 

I experienced and ""defeated"" a disease that could easily have killed me, and should have incapacitated me. It made me so very grounded, and taught me to only live for today. And how much happier that has made me overall. And I think it's so important -- for our mental health -- to live in the today, and not in the ghosts of our past. 

So for those of us in our 40s and beyond who are dating, who still some times think back to the ones who got away, I'm wishing for us that we forget about them. And only look for moments of joy for today.

Is this normal and called casual dating?  Is this normal for the first few weeks of any new relationship and I don't really need to say anything?  How do you judge what is too much with regard to communication or emotional connection?  And how do you limit that in advance?  

I've gone on a couple dates with one person and feel like I grew too connected too quickly.  I like to share who I am, what I am about, even what I feel.  But I think I did that too much.  And now I like her a bit too much.  If I hurt her, I'll feel bad, and if she asks me to be exclusive, I would want to say yes.  I've shared my thoughts with her today, I'll see if she wants to proceed.  I will feel stupid if we call things off mostly because I like her too much.  Maybe I could casually date for a year and then decide I really like her and am ready to be committed.  But I guess that may be a risk that she doesn't want to take.

Am I overthinking this?  For the next person do I simply not share as much?

I‚Äôm still self-conscious about the things I lack visually to attract women, and it‚Äôs still tough to be out by myself on the weekends and see those guys that have those attributes with a woman accompanying them.

I had all weekend to ponder my feelings and what I wanted to do with them. I cried a lot. I journaled a lot. I talked to a trusted best friend. I read. I sat in the quiet with my thoughts. And then on Sunday afternoon I drove to his house. It's a 30 minute drive and I rehearsed all the way there. I wanted to be able to stay focused and not get sidetracked. When I got there mercifully the kids were gone and we had the house to ourselves. I got as far as ""I can't do this anymore"" before I started sobbing. But I just kept going. When I got to the end I swear it was so quiet you could hear a pin drop in the room. I wasn't sure what was going to happen next. He hung his head and said, ""I know you deserve better than I've been able to give you, and I'm sorry."" Then he continued... he said he had no idea I was hurting so much and it was never his intention to cause me pain. He told me that he loves me but he's not in a position to negotiate every other week right now because of his son. He admitted that yes, we've fallen into a bit of a rut because of my work schedule and yes, he'd gotten comfortable with it. Then he said, ""will you give me a chance to fix this?"" I told him I'd be happy with one extra night a week. 

The conversation revealed two things to me: It felt so good to say the words out loud. It wasn't enough to talk about it with strangers, or friends, or even write about it... although I do think that helped me form a more coherent thought so that I could say the words out loud. Sometimes it's good to bounce your thoughts off of a third person. The other thing I realized was that I'd be devastated if this relationship ended. I could have very well gotten to the end of what I had to say and he could have said ""nice knowin' ya."" In that moment of silence, not knowing for sure how he was going to react, I realized, he's the only person I want to spend my life with and if that means slowing down my expectations, while he picks up the pace just a little...

I don't have much experience dating as I've been in relationships for most of my life and met people through friends. I currently live in a small town and don't drive, so my dating pool is limited to men who are ok driving from the nearest cities (all about 1h away).

He is respectful, stable, active, intelligent and takes care of himself. He also has a great personality, a good career and a dry sense of humour which I like. He's overall someone I could see myself having a long-term relationship with as our values align.

On the flipside, he lacks confidence and often self-depreciate himself. More importantly, I don't find him very attractive physically. There's a minimum of attraction because of all the reasons above, but he's not my type and I don't feel any spark. I also recently spent the weekend at his place and was uncomfortable with how recent the divorce feels. She still gets some mail and it's lying around in the house, there's a picture of them at their wedding in the living room, she still has beauty products in the guest bathroom (which he told me beforehand he never uses), etc. He is looking for something long-term and has told me he has no feeling for her anymore, so this might just not be important for him.

My 40yr old ex husband is a disgusting predator who had an affair with a 21 year old server working for him in his restaurant where he is the executive chef. I was blindsided. I was deeply deeply hurt, suffering from severe depression, ptsd &amp; anxiety, and then of course, the pandemic happened and I felt like I  spiraled. I did not want to live anymore. 

Fast forward to now. I have been through extensive trauma focused therapy. Matter of fact about $10k worth, ugh. I started dating. I got into the best shape of my life. I feel much better about my self and my self esteem has skyrocketed. While still angry about my ex‚Äôs disgusting, predatory behavior, the rage is much less frequent &amp; I‚Äôm feeling stronger than ever. I‚Äôve landed some reeeeeally  hot dates, although nothing has really turned into much more, I‚Äôm totally fine with that. I‚Äôve been enjoying casually meeting people. I‚Äôm loving myself. I feel like I exude a lot of confidence. 

Had a few dates tell me they could tell I had been very hurt in the past. So now on dates, I make a conscious effort to not talk about my past or bash the fat disgusting trash I was once married to. (I save that for my girlgang time lol) When the divorced subject comes up, I simply say I‚Äôm divorced and it was because of a gross case of infidelity by my husband. 

Just had what I thought was a great date this weekend. Coffee, lunch, great conversation and connection. After it was over, next day got the same old talk. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre great. You seem like a real person. You‚Äôre beautiful. You seem driven. It seems like you‚Äôve been really hurt in the past and you deserve someone who will give you everything you could ever want in a relationship, but let‚Äôs be friends.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm ok with it. I don‚Äôt have expectations of a full blown relationship from the getgo, ever. My only talk about the ex was when we were mutually speaking about making new travel memories in places we had been with our exes. No bashing, no dwelling, no anger, just stated that I wanted to go back for the fact he was having his affair at the time and I‚Äôd like to make some new memories of the place. 

So my question‚Ä¶(finally lol) 
Are 40+yr old women who were cheated on or abused just looked at as damaged goods even after the ‚Äúglow-up‚Äù? Yes, I was extremely hurt by someone who vowed to love me forever, but I‚Äôve done (and am still doing) the work to fix me. How do I not project this past trauma? I‚Äôd like to think I could have another relationship someday but if I can‚Äôt tell my truths about my past, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like it.

28,po1h68,1631621301,Are people unable to answer more than one question?,"I've been doing OLD for about a year and have been doing ok with results: going on dates with six women, with half of them leading to repeated dates, and one leading to a six month, intense relationship (though she ended up having Borderline Personality Disorder, which led to a traumatic ending).  I think I'm a very good conversationalist, and have connected with many women where we feverishly chatted back and forth with in-depth conversation, leading to many phone calls or video chats (though not always leading to a date).

Beyond the common situation of women responding with very short responses of a few words or a short sentence, one very common problem I see is if you ask a woman two or more questions, they only respond to one - and then it seems rude to ask the missed question again.  If it happens a few times, I often just end the conversation, figuring if a person can't engage in some basic dialogue then it's not worth pursuing further.

Am I expecting too much, that a person can answer multiple questions in an exchange?

&amp;#x200B;

I like to think that I have reasonable and realistic expectations for my next relationship (I've checked with my therapist and trusted friends on this) and I do what I can to put myself out there and find like-minded people. I'm super active in the community - running a hiking group (where I don't date anyone to prevent drama), volunteer on the regular, go to church and PTA meetings, have a robust social circle, and have been told that I'm generally a likable guy (abet overlooked and hard to read at times). 

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like I can be the type of person I'd want to date - aka offer what you want to receive yet not find it in someone else. I can do the inner work and become emotionally available and mature and not find someone who's on the same journey or willing to meet me halfway.  I've traveled, tried doing new things, explored hobbies and volunteer groups, and whatever else people always suggest to meet potential dates....and yet not a single person has ignited that spark (or even a slow burn) that says yeah, I can totally fall for her.   

&amp;#x200B;

I've accepted what I can‚Äôt control is huge and gives me peace. I can reasonably control who I am, how I show up, where I go and what I do, but I can‚Äôt control who others are, how they present themselves and interact, or where they go and what they do. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I've asked my friends where they met their SO, usually it was meeting at work or through mutual friends. None of them met on apps so I don't believe in the 25% of relationships start online statistic. Even on Apps, you have to have a certain amount of luck to find someone compatible.  Based on these observations. I concede that there seems to be a certain luck element in finding your person but dating is one facet of my life that I struggle to accept that luck is the answer. 

&amp;#x200B;

We were both single and after growing closer at work, he confessed one night out of the blue that he had feelings for me (he didn‚Äôt know when he took that leap that I had feelings too).  However due to the difference in our positions (he was much more senior and 14 years older in his 50s), it was inappropriate for us to get into a relationship. I respected him for making that decision as it would have messed up my career not his.  We never kissed or had any sexual relationship although both admitted the attraction was strong.  There was a real intimacy in what we shared with each other when we talked - way beyond colleagues or just friends. 

We continued to work closely together and I left the firm a while later.  He asked me to keep in touch (saying it 3 or 4 times when he said his final goodbye at my leaving drinks) and I had hopes that something might happen after I left. However he never replied to the couple of messages I sent suggesting coffee and a catch up.  I know he suffers from depression managed as best as he can by medication and had resigned himself to never being in another relationship for this reason.  His marriage ended very traumatically and whilst very confident at work, he told me just how shy and unconfident he is around women. He is still single and hasn‚Äôt dated anyone for the last 10 years. 

I just can‚Äôt seem to let go of him.  When I look on dating apps, I am looking for men that remind me of him.  I can‚Äôt find anyone who challenges me intellectually in the same way.  It‚Äôs like he has become the blueprint. When I feel low, I remember how caring he was towards me and how safe he made me feel.  I‚Äôve had two relationships since (one long term) but in all honesty, neither of them came close to touching the feelings I had for him.

I don‚Äôt want to contact him again just to not get a response - it would make me sad. I don‚Äôt want to be desperate or a stalker.  I don‚Äôt want to feel like I imagined it all when he confirmed he felt it too.

How do I let go of him and accept that he knows where to find me and chooses not to.  Are there any books that are helpful for working through this and getting my mind and my heart to just let go?  I don‚Äôt want to carry this sadness with me anymore.  It‚Äôs been 4 years now since I left and 3 years since I last saw him when I bumped into him in a bar.

Both of us are working through divorce/separation. I know the usual advice there, take time to heal, etc. Which I have been doing, and the relationship I was in was really over years ago anyway, even though it's now becoming official. I wasn't sure I was ready for anything serious at the start, but this situation helped me learn that I am. 

The thing is, I've had a lot of dating experience, and I've never felt so sure about something from the beginning. We were compatible on so many levels. There was depth, humor, deep connection, fun, amazing chemistry, shared life goals and drive, we could talk about difficult things and communicate through misunderstandings. It felt perfect.

I know breaking it off was the right thing. Because it felt imbalanced, and I didn't want to be the only one ready for something serious, or continue along this road and be hurt more later. But then, why did it feel so right?! I'm pretty sure it did for him too.

I‚Äôve actually been through this and still to this day over think things but I‚Äôm learning and learning from experience 

If we actually analyse this properly ,let‚Äôs just see if we can come up with a solution or solutions together to help People get through these breakup  s we having 

So what I did was this , I thought of my ex and put her high up on this pedestal
and gave her the status ,that she was the greatest thing since slice bread , she could do no wrong ,she treated me like her king and was she this perfect being who could walk on water 

No we all know this is not true , in fact I wasn‚Äôt happy in the relationship, so why once rejected did I feel sad , lonely and cried like a baby and felt I needed her in my life to continue living 

Well I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that it wasn‚Äôt her I missed it was the thought of what could have been and the dream of this fairy tale that we could live happily ever after and be in love with each other for ever 

I think the thought of being on my own scared me more at first than that of being with someone who wasn‚Äôt right for me , it‚Äôs hard let go of that sometimes and instead of realising that sometimes you have to let things go you become needy and emotionally uncontrollable, they say rejection breeds obsession and it‚Äôs right , we become this lonely sole who needs validating off some one who doesn‚Äôt want to love us anymore 

Some people can flick a switch when they are rejected and think this is fine this is my opportunity to live a better life and grow and seek new things , some go the opposite way

66,pou6zy,1631725257,I'm uptight and righteous about voting,"Alright, I (47m) admit it. I judge people who don't vote. That's on me.

Since Gore V. Bush I've made it a priority myself to vote and I haven't missed an election day since.

I live in California now and vote by mail. I have a drop box on my daily walk route so I usually just drop it in the official drop box once it's completed. Easy.

I have a GF. We've been dating on and off for a little over a year and exclusive since January or so. I would say it's serious.

I care about politics but it doesn't totally rule me - over the last few years it has become more intense and I am fairly liberal personally. I don't really care how someone votes as much as I care that they DO it. Especially if it's so easy and you have the ballot sitting right there. RIGHT THERE. It's a FRICKIN POST CARD kind of simple.

My GF didn't vote in the recall election. She had the ballot at her house right there in plain view and just literally said 'naw, I don't need to. There's no way.' I brought it up to her and at first I tried to be funny about it but when it seemed like she was digging her heels in I just said - it's important to me that people vote but I didn't give her an ultimatum or say I couldn't be with someone who didn't vote. That isn't even really the case, I understand that not everyone feels the way I do and that sometimes life gets in the way. Actually I don't because in the US federal law provides for time to vote and employers must allow you to do so. Whatever though, life happens. She says she usually does but 'doesn't need to this time.'  

This isn't life happening, this is her choosing to not vote and then when I told her it was important to me she seemed to dig in spitefully. 

Spite is intended to hurt.

Oh also, I have baggage (cause I'm over 40 and we all pretty much have something right?). I was in a relationship for a long time where I accepted things I didn't like, things that were less important than this but also things that were far worse. I accepted them. I was hella unhappy though. My point is that I have certainly lived with a lot worse things in a partner but at this point, I do not want to live with not good enough ever again.

I didn't ask her to do it because I didn't feel that I had the right to ask that of her - it is her choice. I just don't like her choice. I feel differently about her now. 

I have seen on the dating apps, 'Don't contact me if you are a (Conservative/Liberal/Whatever)' and I've never quite been there but I have shied away from the more Trumptastic of the ladies...

I know I need to talk to her and my talking point is mainly that when I told her it was important to me she seemed to dig in her heels and get spiteful in a 'you can't make me' kind of way. We can talk about it and she can be 'sorry' even maybe but you can't undo things like this. It hasn't changed completely how I feel about her but I do feel less than I did before and having just really reentered the dating world a couple of years ago and having her be my first real relationship of substance since my marriage ended - navigating this is a little new for me.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pou6zy/im_uptight_and_righteous_about_voting/

Hi there, and thanks for reading, 
5 years ago I divorced my husband. Admittedly I was in a messed up place in life, our marriage of 14 years was in the gutter, I felt incredibly lonely and I left him for another man, who I‚Äôve since been married too but recently separated. Around the time of my first divorce, I had a best friend Lilly, but we had a falling out after I learnt that she and my husband went out for coffee quite soon after my divorce with him. Me and Lilly we incredibly close, like sisters, and I felt so betrayed, I immediately cut her off and we haven‚Äôt talked since. Lilly also went through a depressive episode after an abortion (which she chose to have I must add) and tried to harm herself (in a serious manner) at my place when I was out of town, just before I saw her out for coffee with my ex , I ended the friendship due to that as well, as I needed to protect my young daughter from her negative toxic energy. Anyways, she claimed nothing ever happened between them but there‚Äôs absolutely no way I believe her and I always felt my ex husband had a sweet spot for her. 

Anyways, I‚Äôve been in bad shape after my second separation, and I‚Äôve tried to regain somewhat of a friendship with my ex husband. Obviously too much has happened between us for anything to ever be romantic, but I was hoping for us to build a friendship again. Yesterday he came round and confessed that him and Lilly have been dating for 9 months, and that he‚Äôs serious about her. I‚Äôm absolutely fuming over this. I also don‚Äôt want Lilly around me and me and my ex husbands child because I know Lilly is mentally unstable. I told my ex that I think he‚Äôs making a huge mistake and that I know her better then he does, but he won‚Äôt listen.

I lived with her and had to moved out , I took my stuff ( what she let me have ), we had to get rid of the dog , I found a new house and I am slowly getting my head around being on my own , sleepless nights and thoughts of what could have been 

It‚Äôs even more difficult as she has now moved on with another guy and what was once a beautiful time in my life with her , has led me now to reflect on the things , we once had and valuable lessons I have not learnt from and did things wrong all in the name of love

At This time in my life it is even worse than my first LTR that lasted 17 years , even when there were kids involved and she nearly financial ruined me , only in January of this year have I managed to get myself off her mortgage after 14 years separation , through no fault of my own 

I look back and through all the emotions and heartbreak and money I have thrown at these women , I know only now I have learnt some lessons , that I should have seen ,for one I should have been stronger and put myself first , this would have surely overcome the kick in the teeth I got from not standing up for what was mine 

At 50 I look after myself and consider myself a decent looking guy with good values , my ex was beautiful and 11 years younger than me , but the emotions that have come with , the separation I now find it hard to give myself to any body else and dating or even a friend with benefits is not on the cards at all , I can‚Äôt even contemplate it 

Through the last 7 Months I tried to be friends withy ex but ended up blocking her and deleting her number on Saturday  as it was too hard to try to be friends , knowing I should have done this months ago as she is now dating another guy and what I didn‚Äôt know wouldn‚Äôt have hurt me and my life would have been allot further on than it is now 

A VALUABLE LESSON TO ANY ONE TALKING ABOUT THUS SHOULD I GO NO CONTACT ‚Äú‚Äù HELL YES DEFINITELY AND DO IT NOW THEY WONT BE IN YOUR LIFE MUCH LONGER EVEN IF YOU THINK THEY ARE GOING TO BE - BE STRONG‚Äù

So the top and bottom
Of it all is that I don‚Äôt think I can go through this again giving my all only to be broken up With ,when it all goes wrong , one of the things I need learn to do is stop overthinking , stop worrying , learn to let go and put myself first before anyone else , which has been a massive wake up call

The positives out of this is below 


1. I have 2 fantastic kids who love me dearly 
2. I have fantastic friends who love me dearly 
3. I have made some new friends who I can socialise with even more

Evenings were family time, and weekends were my parents basically doing everything together. Complicating this, mom and dad were control freaks ‚Äî they didn‚Äôt like other people telling them how to live their lives (except for dad‚Äôs work ‚Äî dad played the corporate schmoozing game well); this extended to my sister and I ‚Äî growing up, mom and dad didn‚Äôt have space in their lives for our opinions, and our job was basically to tag along with them silently nights and weekends (note: thank goodness I‚Äôm generation X ‚Äî weekdays were my free time since my parents turned us loose in the neighborhood while they worked; teams sports were also a sanctuary for me). 

Perhaps because of this, it may have been inevitable I ended up with a wife of 25 years was a control freak ‚Äî it was her way or the highway ‚Äî and for the most part my job (after work) was to support her wishes and plans.

When I‚Äôm not with families or SOs, I make friends very easily ‚Äî but my parents and then later my wife never liked my friends, or wanted to do anything I suggested. So over time, I learned not to include friends in my plans, or to make plans outside of what my wife or parents wanted.

In the year or two between living with my parents and meeting my wife, and then in those months after my wife left me, I rarely had free time because I was always with friends and making plans, and when I dated I was pretty good at making fun and spontaneous dates. But that is a side of me I‚Äôve learned to shut down when I‚Äôm in a relationship.

Now I am in a new LTR with a wonderful lady. And most of the time we do things by ourselves, or with her daughter, or with her friends, and she is so supportive and loving of me, but only rarely we do things with my family or friends as I revert to that old passive side of myself. 

Today some of my friends reached out ‚Äî do my SO and I want to do something with them tonight?  And I suddenly realized how much stress I feel when a friend reaches out to me. What if my SO has other plans for us? Or she doesn‚Äôt want to spend an evening with my friends tonight? Suddenly I feel stress that when a friend invites us out, I am creating inconvenience for my SO or will decline and thus disappoint my friends. In short, I worry that I will disappoint someone just because my friend(s) invited us out. 

It‚Äôs just so much easier for me to not have my own friends (especially since I can make friends soooooooo easily when I want to). Which probably isn‚Äôt healthy. And makes me sad‚Ä¶

How messed up it is to be a social and affable person who has been conditioned by 50 years of being controlled by other people‚Äôs agendas. I need to fix this ‚Äî it will make me even a better partner for my SO‚Ä¶",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/ppgzw4/making_plans_with_my_friends_is_stressful_for_me/

Woke up this morning  to a message from him sent around 1 am telling me it was a huge red flag for him that I was online and didn‚Äôt respond or acknowledge his message and that he didn‚Äôt believe in games and ghosting.

92,ppk3xb,1631820199,Can Women Love Men Unconditionally if It Means a Very Humble Life?,"It wasn‚Äôt until I hit my 40‚Äôs when I started believing that men love unconditionally better than women do. 

I truly believe most men can live a humble life without materiel objects or any sort of wealth and still find happiness. We have a childlike quality in that respect. 

I don‚Äôt believe the same can be said for most women. I think they could learn to tolerate it but I don‚Äôt believe they could ever find peace or happiness living that way. 

I know there‚Äôs some women out there that can love unconditionally but again, if it meant living a humble existence, I think they‚Äôd be miserable. 

Is it the lack of security? The uncomfortableness of not knowing what to expect? Why the drive for more?

93,ppl0kc,1631822917,Meta Discussion - Posts with good comments that get deleted by the original poster,"Does anyone else get disappointed when a post generates some really good and potentially helpful discussions and then the original poster deletes it, removing it from the feed?

By way of counter-example, some subreddits use bots and other tools to keep the text of the original post, and others have rules that discourage deletion of posts. I'm not saying that's the best solution or even *a* solution here -- just tossing that out there for informational purposes.

I suppose the flip side of this is people should be able to delete something that is potentially embarrassing or harmful to them, and I understand and support both privacy and the ability to exert at least some control over one's presence on the internet. Keeping people as safe as possible should always be the *first* priority.

Still ... I get a little sad when I see good discussions vanish because I can't help but think they may have actually helped someone else in the future.

94,ppnm2b,1631831191,Good news maybe- please help!,"I (45f) haven‚Äôt been in a healthy type of relationship in a while. I started talking to someone on Bumble while on quarantine leave and as soon as I was released we met. We‚Äôve now been out twice and both times were pretty great. He just texted me today(Thursday) and said that a friend was flying in and he would be busy all weekend. We didn‚Äôt have plans to see each other(I‚Äôve been honestly playing it by ear because the covid lethargy is kicking in pretty hard) and this was completely unprompted(I had not texted him). It kind of shocked me because we‚Äôve only been out twice, have not been intimate and I honestly felt like he didn‚Äôt owe this to me. It‚Äôs nice to know that he‚Äôs taken my feelings into consideration and didn‚Äôt just ghost me all weekend (not sure if this would‚Äôve happened with him, but it has happened to me before). My response was that I hoped he have fun and because he‚Äôs not lived in this area long I suggested some good local restaurants. Did I handle this well? I‚Äôm stupid curious about who it is, but I‚Äôm not going to push it because, again, I feel like he doesn‚Äôt owe me an explanation. I do like this man, so I‚Äôm hoping that I didn‚Äôt play it too cool, by suggesting places and end up pushing him away.

95,ppocm7,1631833966,Seeking Advice,"I (42M) have been widowed for 18 months. I was with my wife for almost 20 years before she passed and that was the longest relationship I ever had. Before she passed we talked about the future and what she wanted for me. Of course I didn‚Äôt want to have those conversations but I knew it was important for her to let me know how she felt. 

Now, my daughter (20F) has told me that she thinks it‚Äôs time I get back in the dating scene as she says she doesn‚Äôt want me to think I have to be alone. Im thankful that my daughter and I are able to openly discuss this type of situation and that she understands that at some point I need to move on with my life.

I guess what im getting at is if there are any fellow widowers in this group, how did you approach the dating scene after your loss? What did you find worked for you? The last time I even knew what OLD was the internet functioned off of a compact disk with 400 free hours. This new scene with the likes of Tinder, POF, Match and so on makes me feel weird.

97,ppr52f,1631844370,Can I rant? I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre all sick of hearing the same crap,"It‚Äôs the same old story, same old song and dance..

But it‚Äôs so true. I understand all too well why it‚Äôs like this, yet I don‚Äôt. Why is it this hard? Why do we constantly match up, and then a few days or weeks later get discarded? Or discard ourselves? 

Ugh I was so hopeful. Yet again. Met a wonderful, cute woman and moved things right along..we met within five days. And now the texting is disappearing already, after she (and I!) was super excited for a second date, telling me she wanted to take me out this time, and saying how cute I was for asking to see her again soon the next day. 

Ugh. I hate dating. Too many flakes, too many bad dates, and in the real world every woman I meet has a goddam ring on it. If I by chance meet a naked ring finger, she‚Äôs a train wreck in some way. 

I get into a week or two high..multiple matches and some conversations and a date sometimes out of it. Then it dies out for a few weeks and the cycle starts again. It‚Äôs always the few weeks after a good prospect exits that the apps kill my algorithm or whatever it is they do, so my anxiety and depression both take over and I‚Äôm just bummed for a week. 

I just want to be happy with someone. Not be lonely anymore. I was looking forward to spring adventures with someone. Nope. Then summer beach fun. Nope. Now fall excursions seem like they‚Äôre flirting away by the wayside too and with them the holidays‚Ä¶alone again and putting on a brave face for my kids and family/friends who all think I should‚Äôve been locked down by someone easily. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a catch!‚Äù ‚ÄúAny woman is looking for exactly what you offer!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just not being forward/funny/adventurous/(insert any descriptor here) enough‚Äù 

And so I go on. What was that song in the 90‚Äôs? ‚ÄúYou love her, but she loves him, and he loves somebody else, ya just can‚Äôt win‚Äù
