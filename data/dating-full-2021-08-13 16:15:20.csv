I'm a 26 years old dude and as a professional overthinker and ruminator, when a girl I'm seeing decides to no longer see me, I get extermely hurt and automatically enter overthinking mode and try to figure out what the hell I might have done wrong.
A few months ago I asked out a girl I knew pretty well, at first she told me she has to think about it since there are some things that are going on in her life. 2 days later, she comes up to me and says that she'd also like to go out with me but I should know that she has an ex she hasn't entirely gotten over but if I'm willing to give it a shot, she'd like so too so I said yes. She was the third girl I ever dated. The first date went quite well and we made plans to meet up again. The second date also went very well and we kissed, the problem comes from what I said after we kissed. For some reason the first thing after the aftermath was to ask how did I do and she said: 'Fine, why?' And I said: 'No particular reason, it's just this is my second kiss"" and she asked how and I proceeded to tell her a bit about the first girl I dated(the second one lasted only one date so it's not relevant), what I said was: 'We went on a our first date, it went pretty well and we kissed, the day after she called me and asked me to take things slow, and there was quarantine and we didn't see each other for a month, and then we went out again and it wasn't all that great and then she ended it. I don't wanna go too much in depth into it but I learned from the whole thing and I wanna bring everything I've learned to this thing here."" As you can see, I overshared but despite this the date continued pretty well and she even shared some personal stuff. After some more talking I brought up a plan for our next date and since we live a 2 hour drive away from each other I offered to pick her up, she asked if it was okay with me and I said: ""yeah, if I did that for her(the first girl I dated), then of course I'll do that for you too(The first girl I dated also lived a 2 hour drive from where I live)"". Again oversharing. The day after date, she calls and asks to meet up(We work at the same place) and tells me that she realized that she hasn't gotten over her ex and she can't see herself going into another relationship right now. She told me that he dumped her because he wasn't looking for anything serious and she tried to get back together with him, even as a non-serious thing but he still declined.
It's been a 5 months since then and only recently I've realized I've overshared and I keep beating myself up for it, blaming myself for this whole thing ending even though she gave me a reason that sounds real and not just some excuse. I'm just afraid that perhaps the fact that I didn't have so much dating experience at the time or the fact that I mentioned that I was willing to make a 2 hour drive also for the first girl I dated turned her off or made her feel jealous, which wasn't my intention at all. I just wanted to be honest with her but I guess I was too honest too soon.
Any advice/different perspective on the whole situation?

Also in this whole technological age there is so much flaking and ghosting after someone either gets what they want or after they realize being with this person is not what they wanted and then they return to their illusion of finding a prince charming or some ideal woman (neither of which exist). 

And it seems that almost no relationships are genuine nowadays. It almost seems to be crazy superficial and self centered for bragging rights. I think with women they might find this top of the line man they’ve been seeking and show him off all while this man isn’t loyal or just uses her. And it’s this ridiculous cycle that nobody seems to realize when it comes to picking these ego driven narcissists for dating purposes.

I went on 7/8 dates with a woman and we spoke everyday. In the beginning, we got on a great. Both seemed to have a dry sense of humor and she seemed to like me a lot. On the 4th date (I know I should have ended things at this point.) She argued with me because I joked I wish I could come back to hers that night (I had already spent the night). Normally, this would be a ""I wish"" moment but she got very annoyed and said I was making her feel bad etc, which I was really taken back by because it was like a switch in personality. 

Then we went out again and I actually can't even remembed what happened but she argued with me again but we resolved it before I left. 

Then we went out again (I know- what am I actually doing at this point?!) and guess what she started an argument with me because she made a comment she didn't like the energy of someone in the bar and I said shall we go somewhere else...well this set her off again and tbh I wasn't having a good time at this point and said lets go but she was insistent on walking me to the train station even though she seemed in a bad mood so I said dont worry about it and then she goes off again that I don't listen to her and I made a comment like ""god get me out of here"" and she stormed off. 

Then things shifted, we were still talking but things weren't as flirty and she normally came off quite strongly, we hadn't slept together in weeks and I just said what are doing? 

She said she didn't know if it was best to continue romantically or be friends. I said if you're having to ask yourself that question then we shouldn't continue (I knew we shouldn't continue and tbh this is on me but at this point I didn't feel like I liked her much anymore but it had been nice to have someone into me again after the pandemic and I kept hoping that the woman I had first hung out with would come back.) Anyway, she sent me a load of angry voicenotes that obviously she didn't want to be my friend and she fucking liked me a lot but didn't know what was for the best. Everything I said triggered her more so I stopped replying.

We went a day without speaking and then she messaged me asking how I was and we started chatting plantonically. She did make a few flirty comments but nothing like before. 

We met up a week later and went to the cinema and for drinks. I just hugged her when I saw her, didn't kiss her but in the cinema she was touching me etc and we did end up kissing after a few drinks. It wasn't the best time tbh, it felt awkward not like before but we didn't argue atleast. 

Sorry this is getting very long. Lastly, I again bought up what were we doing and she said she was confused what was best after the arguing and she had a lot going on so I said I understood now was not a good time and tbh it just comes across that you don't really like me at this point. And she explodes! Starts swearing at me what the fuck do I know about what she feels and how dare I tell her how she feels and she was done talking about this topic anymore. 

At this point (very late I know) I said I was done with all it and good luck with everything. 

This was a week ago and I'm still confused what the hell happened. Does it sound like she just put on a front when we first spoke and then the real her came out or was it me.

She could only make time for me like every 2 or 3 weeks

Whenever I did see her the vibe seemed solid, but eventually after time I snapped at her, it sucks to just sit and wait around for the person you like to only make time to see you twice a month. I waited to tell her my frustration because I didn't wanna seem needy. 

But I exploded In frustration and gave the ultimatum because riding the line between FWB and something serious starts to drain me, especially after 6 months. 

I told her that ""I've been bending over backwards for you over and over and have gotten nothing but breadcrumbs of effort in return, all I wanted was for you to try, if doing all the things I've done for you the last 6 months isn't enough for you to see I'm serious about you I don't know what is.""

So as a F26 I’ve never had a boyfriend ever and I always felt there was something wrong with me because I see friends of mine getting engaged, married, having kids and stuff. I’ve had first dates before but it would never go more than that. So a few months ago, I decided to download hinge to try it out and see what’ll happen. I was talking to a few guys but it would never lead to a first date. Skip to 2 weeks ago and a guy matched with me because I liked one of his photos. We started talking and I noticed that the convo had more substance than the other guys I would talk to. His texting was a little dry but it didn’t bother me- but it did make me have lower expectations that maybe he’s dry in person. He asks me out for a first date after a week of talking, I agreed, we met at a coffee shop and I was pleasantly surprised how much warmer he’s in person. We walked with our coffees to a park bench overlooking a lake and sunset. Our conversations were amazing- we couldn’t stop laughing and talking over each other and we had such a good time. We ended the night with him walking me to my car and a hug which was nice. We continued texting each other the day after for another week before him asking for a second date and I agreed! We went out for dinner this time and I was worried that maybe it wouldn’t be as good as our first date but it was even better. We have a lot to talk about, a lot in common, the same sorta goals and values, and way of thinking. We kept on laughing throughout the night and having a good time. He asked if I was talking to anyone else and I told him that I wasn’t and I asked him the same and he said that when he was first talking to me, he was talking to maybe two other girls but decided to focus on talking to me instead and dropped those other girls. By the end of the night, he told me that he can’t stop thinking about me and that said jokingly that I’m basically haunting his dreams lol. Then today, he texted me saying that again and that I’ve been on his mind all day and I feel the exact same way. I feel like I’m obsessed with him even though we’ve only seen each other twice.

Basically i'm in highschool and there is this cute girl I see all the time at school, I've only gotten eye contact with her twice, and I want to get to know her and maybe ask her out, but I dont know how to do go about it.

I've asked around and the advice I've gotten seems to come with pros and cons:

1. Go up to her and be upfront, tell her she's cute and you'd like to take her out and get to know her more.  
The problem with this is, I know confidence is attractive, but isnt this too upfront? Wouldn't she be weirded out or creeped out by some random guy she doesnt know going to up to her without any reason other than the fact that he thinks she's physically attractive?
2. Be her friend first, introduce yourself and get to know her. Then after you get to know her and be her friend, ask her out  
The problem with this advice, is that isnt it manipulative? Wouldn't I only be becoming her friend just because I like her, and want to ask her out? What if I end up getting to know her, and develop feelings for her, and she ends up rejecting me because she thought I only wanted to be friends and nothing more. Then she'll end up saying I only became her friend because I liked her body or some shit like that, thats happened to my other friends when they got rejected.

Hi everyone,

I've been talking to this guy for the last couple of months, great guy and all. The problem is he lives on the East Coast and I'm on the West Coast (CA) - so pretty much 3 hour difference between us. He would stay up with me the first month even though he had work next days and tired at nighttime. He'd end up sleeping late like 1am.

So lately, the texting and talking have been lessened because he gets so exhausted after work that he ends up sleeping at about 9pm (6pm my time). He had said this initially when we we just started talking, that his days consisted of going to work and goes to bed early cause he would always be so tired. Which I felt bad, of course.

So, when we would talk, I would just force him to go to sleep cause I didn't want to keep him up that late even though I love talking to him, I know he can't stay up so late for me everytime.

So these, past few days, we barely talked, so I was feeling needy this morning, so I jokingly asked, if he still wanted to talk to me with laughing emoji. His response is ""I do...Im just tired all the time (with crying emoji). I haven't responded yet because I dont know what to say. I just feel bad. It's also the reason, I'm hesitant to message him sometimes cause I dont know if I'm just bugging him at night.

I’ve personally have never been in a relationship and I’m veryyy inexperienced. I started using these dating apps and found someone on facebook dating and we matched then chatted for an hour and I asked her if she would like to meet up somewhere. She said yes and we met up like a few weeks later due to her being busy with work and all. We went to the mall, shopped, and talked for two hours then went to eat and she was under a time pressure which she talked about via chat before meeting up and she had to leave. 

We planned another meetup and things keep coming up and now we’re gonna meet up a month later. I don’t know if she’s interested in me or not, I try to chat about things every day (I sometimes am clueless about what to chat about, but I try to find something)  and she responds and sometimes not when I ask personal things like if she did something exciting or not. I can never manage to make long converdations. We planned to go next week. 

How do I know if a girl is interested in me or not? I’m too afraid to ask her if she wants to date me or not because I feel like I wouldn’t recover from the mental trauma. I’m even afraid to say that these are dates even though they are kind of are because if we meet up after finding each other in dating apps then they are dates?

He lives on third floor and her rooms on second floor. They haven’t been together in the sense of being a couple for two years. However, they have 3 children together. A few months prior to us starting to date, he moved in with her due to financial reasons. Basically, he and his roommate got evicted and he had no where to go. Since he still gets time to be with the kids, she agreed to let him move in. The guy is mess, he got felony neglect charges in relation to his children, has a bad temper, no drivers license. She’s tried to bring up getting a dissolution and he refuses to sign the papers. Hence why they’re still married. 

Since we’ve only been dating four months, I’ve tried to be understanding about the situation. I’ve only gone to her house a few times, usually when he isn’t there. Though one time he came in while we were sitting on the couch together. It was weird but cordial. I’ve met her kids a few times, hung out with her parents, and sisters. The situation has made me pretty anxious but I’ve dealt with it because I really care about her. That was until….

My girlfriend and I went on a trip to the beach for 5 days. In fact, it’s the first vacation she’s ever taken with a significant other we were both so excited. However….The first night he went crazy, cut himself and had blood all over their home. Her mother had to go clean it up and take the kids until we got back. Apparently he was drunk beating the walls and screaming “she never loved me”. Until then, I really didn’t think he had feelings for her. They’ve both dated people over the last two years. What’s different is that my girlfriend is actually happy with me and according to her, she’s used to seeing her utterly miserable dating anyone. 

Last week when we got back from our trip she told me that she was going to have a convo with him about moving out. It’s tough because my girlfriend doesn’t make much money and relies on him to pay $500 of the $1500 rent. He’s previously agreed to keep paying that when moving out. But I really haven’t gotten an update and when I brought it up she took the route that I wasn’t trusting her when she said it’ll be soon. She’s reassured me that I’m the person she wants to spend the rest of her life with. 

I guess why I’m here today is because it’s really starting to bother me. It sucks I can’t just go to her house to hang out and be apart of her life in that way. I just want things to develop naturally but with him living there it really feels like such a barrier.

She’s coming over tonight and I want to bring up the situation but I want it to come off the right way. I’d like a timeline of when he’s going to move out but I also don’t want to be needy and annoying about it.

I’ve turned into one of those girls that I never understood.  One of those girls that when you hear their situation you’re like “girl, seriously?  Get tf out!”  Yet here I am…wishing I knew wtf happened.  How did I even get here?  

I’ve discovered that most recently he’s been stealing my money.  And not without me knowing…sort of.  He will either ask me for help or ask me for a smaller amount mostly when I’m half asleep so I open my phone and my banking app and because I’m a heavy sleeper he does it for me.  He asked for $25 for gas and reluctantly I said yes.  Come to find out he took the last $91 I had in my account after I asked him not to.   And he didn’t say a word about it.  I found out when I checked my account a day or so later.  WTF had he been doing with all the money he’s been making on his own?  

About a week before that I told him I would help buy him a new cell phone since his broke and he was using a shit cheap Walmart phone that was so slow you could barely do anything.  He told me he found a deal through AT&amp;T where he only had to pay $100 online and would get a new phone along with a tablet that he could use for work.  Great deal right?  On and then it went from $100 to $120 because of taxes and fees so I sent him another $120.  Throughout the next week I would ask when his phone would be here since he said it was supposed to be quick and the only answer I would get is “oh idk I think I have to go into the store”.  At this moment I started to get suspicious seeing as how his current Walmart phone was soooooo horrible and he would get so frustrated.  In my mind, with a phone that bad wounding you be watching the mail like a hawk?  But he just seemed to never know what the deal was with it.  Finally two days ago he got a ride to one of the AT&amp;T stores and when he came back he only had a phone, no tablet so I asked about it. “Oh, apparently I would have had to pay a bunch more and I misunderstood what was on the website” or something similar.   Then he tells me he had to pay $70 for the phone he ended up getting.  But what about the $120 I sent you that you said you paid online towards a different phone and tablet?  So apparently they used the $120 I sent him that he paid online and the $70 he paid in person (now a total of $190).  But that includes the phone, service, activation, blah blah blah.  Ok; we’ll it looks like a nice ass phone so that was it.  

Now…I confirmed with him a few times that he paid $120 Online for this phone and tablet deal and every time he said yes and seemed excited about it.   Yesterday he left to run an errand or something and I decided to tidy up our room.  On the side table next to the bed his receipt for the phone.  Not hidden or under anything, just sitting in plain sight.   Wait a minute, that can’t be right.  He paid $75 at the store like he said but financed the $174 balance.  There is no mention of the $120 he “paid online”.  

So he straight up lied to my face multiple times and I have no idea what he did with the money because it’s sure as hell gone.  And this isn’t the first time he’s asked for my help paying something and spent the money elsewhere.   

I’m so upset that I haven’t even said anything yet because if I do it’s going to come out fucking angry.  And why am I even worried about the way it’s going to come out because what he did was fucked up. And like I said it’s not the first time he’s done something like this which is why I started to get suspicious in the first place after I asked him the first time where his phone was and he gave me some nonchalant bullshit answer.

And this doesn’t even begin to come anywhere close to all the other shit that he’s pulled lately.   And from what I’m finding out he’s been doing some shady shit for months.  

We’ve been together almost 6 years. We’ve technically been broken up for the past two months but because of the situation that we are in we are still living together, sleeping in the same bed, etc.  And this is how it’s been for the past six years.  The times we have broken up,  we’ve never actually split up.  We Always stayed together and ended up getting back together because we both knew we were going to spend the rest of our lives together.  We haven’t lived apart from each other since we met.  Honestly I’m not even sure that this time we’re going to end up getting back together. Things have just getting to a point where I’ve been so unhappy that it’s very obvious and I don’t hide it well. And i’ve been sure to let him know that he has hurt me and how bad he’s hurt me lately. I know  he can see it.  It’s in my body language and written on my face daily.  I don’t know why he won’t just leave.  I’ve told him to and he never ends up doing it.  Is it because he’s been using me and hasn’t gotten everything that he’s wanted yet? Does he still love me? Is it both?

I'm a 23 year old guy who graduated college, was in a fraternity, I play music in 2 bands, and work for an investment firm. I have great friends and a great support system, but despite these things I tend to fail at relationships. 

I don't even know if it's my fault but I put a lot of pressure on myself. I have pretty bad anxiety which I started recently going back to therapy for. I've been in/out of therapy since 7th grade for it. 

This fling/whatever this was that I had with a girl recently fizzled out/ended. She was 20. She can't even legally drink yet and not that im some huge party animal, but looking back it would've been hard to date someone who doesn't turn 21 for another 7 months. 

I'm curious as to if someone can explain this. We went on a few dates and talked for about 4 months. She would give me ample amounts of attention (comment heart faces on my Instagram pics, FT me, text me a lot, reach out to me when she knew a was feeling down or stressed) etc. 

Despite her saying she didn't want anything serious she was definitely dropping a lot of attention on me and was invested more than I thought. 

I got used to it. I kinda dug what she was giving me and she was really fun and attractive. Neither of us talked about expectations for a WHILE. Around the 3 month mark I let my balls drop and asked her where her head was at. 

We agreed we didn't want anything serious and wanted to feel it out more, so I asked her if she wanted to keep it casual for now. She told me she didn't know, but wanted to keep going on dates with me and seeing me &amp; that she didn't know what she wanted. 

I wasn't and still not ready to commit to something, so I agreed. Ended it saying how I'd like to continue what we've been doing and she told she would love that too. After that conversation it stated to die down. 

The last month I was driving myself crazy. Over analyzing, getting anxious, and thinking about her constantly. We lost our snap streak &amp; I didn't wanna be needy so I would message her every couple days. We would talk still &amp; actually made plans for another date but it fell thru. I never double texted or showed any signs of neediness. 

I got tired of being the one to reach out. I flat out told her about how the convos have been 1 sided. She mentioned that she was content w her friends in her life ands he's also traveling a lot right now. 

She also mentioned how it's hard to see me when I live an hour away. I live an hour from her since I recently moved. She came to see me once when I moved into my first apartment. 

She told me she ""needed space from this relationship for a little"". I thanked her for being honest and asked her if she wanted to cut ties completely or if she just needed some space and that I'd lever her alone. Told her I didn't want energy wasted on either end. She got pissed and told me ""I've said it so many times now. I just want space rn. Thank you"". I didn't respond. Wish she hadn't been rude to me when I'm just trying to resolve an issue. 

I noticed she did remove me from her private snap story after that but she follows me on everything still and I can see her normal snap posts and she looks at mine.

She's young, moved to a new state less than a year ago, lives at home, in college. I can't be too upset i feel like. We are at completely different stages in our lives right now. I'm a little sore about it but it's been nice knowing I don't have to think about her as much. 

I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around everything. The mixed signals, no boundaries being established, and her getting mad at me just kinda messed with my mind a little.

So one of my best friends friends has been on my mind for the last two years. We nearly kissed once like 5 years ago but nothing happened. Fast forward 3 years after us both being in other relationships and I see him for the first time in those 3 years due to distance and my brain literally says wow. I was in a relationship at the time, as was he. Then just before pandemic hits I leave my ex. I was so unhappy and I had to do it. Because of the pandemic, I end up going to stay with my best friend mentioned,  in the city her and the guy in question both live in. (To which I have now moved to whilst I decide if I move somewhere else for work ) And within a week I am seeing him every day through my friends and I think about him constantly. It’s fireworks in my belly every time I see him. 

3 weeks of me being there, we go out for his 30th birthday where he tells me drunk that he’d have babies with me, that he wished I was going to Africa with him(rather than his then gf) and that he’d marry me in a heartbeat. At this point he knows that we have booked a trip to Italy as a surprise for the best friend. 


I wake up the next day and my best friend tells me how he even told her last night that he thanked her for introducing him to the love of his life. 

Fast forward to the holiday where he’s singing love songs behind me s we walk the streets of Italy. No cheating involved I’ve still never kissed him. 

Upon returning I just can’t see him around any longer as he’s still got a gf who he doesn’t want to be with but I also can’t cope with the chemistry and confusion anymore. 

Fast forward 1 year, he’s now single I’ve given him 6 months space then I ask him out for a drink, and he says no because he doesn’t want anything to be awkward because of our friends. But he didn’t think about this when he was the one telling them all this information about how much he liked me before. I told him I understood but that I would have regretted not asking him so wanted to for myself. 

I really believe he does have strong feelings for me but doesn’t want to hold me back from doing things in my life. I just feel really hurt and confused because I know that the feeling is mutual and we are old enough to not cause drama from this. I genuinely could have seen a life with him.

We had some good conversation and, as a first, he suggest the video chat. I have been suggesting video chats with all online matches for safety reasons.. and to avoid cat fishing. The video chat went well. He had a good amount of confidence and the conversation flowed well, with the right amount of flirtyness. 
After texting a little bit more, we decide to start planning our first date. His first availability is not for 3 more weeks, this was surprising but not crazy. He sends me texts every few days wishing me good days and it feels like a good amount of communication given we have not met yet. The day of the date, I sent a text to see if we are still on. At this point we had not actually set a time or location so it didn’t feel for sure. Then he texts me “I was just about to text you, I have to travel to Seattle for work all of a sudden can we please reschedule”. This feels a little like a soft rejection because there was no definitive plan nor a definitive reschedule. We continue to chat after he has arrived. I’m trying to get more details about his job and the situation to gauge whether he is actually forced to work today. His responsiveness is indicating that he is not working so I’m already suspicious. I go to revisit his dating profile to take a look at his photos again (he’s cute) and notice that he has reduced his photos and only his dog and ones where his face isn’t showing are on the profile. I also notice his distance away is significantly different than if he were actually in Seattle. His texting turns to a little bit of love bombing but i yet to brush it aside. He has given me a heads up that “since he knows I like to schedule things, I should be aware that a family trip is coming up in a few months where they bring their significant others and he thinks he will want to bring me, so keep that in mind!”.
Instead of blatantly accusing him of possibly lying, I thought I would slyly gather more information. I ask him to send me a picture of his hotel view. He says “why do you assume I have a view”?. I just assumed he had a window, not thinking it had to be a view of anything spectacular. He sends me a photo of a gorgeous lit up Seattle skyline. 
My paranoia gets the best of me and I reverse google image search the photo. Lo and behold, it is a stock photo that has been posted multiple times. I stop responding because I just can’t think of a good reason I should be lied to at this stage. 
In the morning, he texts again. At this point I’ve had enough and tell him that I know he’s being dishonest and this is an opportunity for him to be become more honest now. We hop on the phone for a chat and he ultimately discloses that he is in a different city and thought I could not be trusted with his true location. That he sent a fake photo because he thought I was possibly gold. digging. And since we are being honest, he shares that he has 4 children. Apparently they are between 4-15 and none were unplanned. He says he is 31. His profile which preciously his his age, reads 36. 
At this point my head is spinning and 4 kids alone is a dealbreaker let alone lying. I need time to process and we end the call. I slowly become less responsive as I realize this is not the situation for me.

I am not about bothering someone while they are working but it seems like we are playing a cat and mouse game.
