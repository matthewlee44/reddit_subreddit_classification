I don't mind that much anymore unless I think about my breakup. Doesn't happen that often now. Recently I met a cute guy on a dating app. At first, I didn't feel much, but we have a really good connection with each other, and the other day when we hang out we started flirting a little bit more. Aggressive flirting lol. 

I felt great, I had a tingling sensation, maybe the so-called butterflies in my stomach and I saw him in a new light. I mean I always thought he was quite cute but the sexual tension was never there until that moment. 

The thing is, since I'm fine being on my own and I do care about this guy, I don't want to get into a relationship without actually wanting to. And in September I start school again and the possibility of meeting new people is exciting.

Last night I took her out again. Went back to her place and we caught a movie. She was cuddling next to me a and was gently running her fingertips over me so I knew she’s in some type of mood. We make out and this time I’m proceeding with caution so I don’t do anything she’s uncomfortable with. Ultimately I’m able to finger her. I knew she had “finished” and we kinda left it as is. By this time it’s 3am and we’re both kinda tired at this point.

When I left, I couldn’t help but to think that I should’ve escalated it more? I know it’s a strange worry of mine, but I didn’t want to be placed in a position that I was making her uncomfortable so I didn’t push it further.

Then nothing for 6 months and in the middle of the summer during the pandemic we matched on tinder and proceeded to date for 3 months which was a nice summer fling but she broke it off with me as she was going home for 2 months and didn't want to do long distance. I thought that was fine as I wasn't looking for anything serious at the time.

Come the beginning of the autumn semester  we started seeing each other again but then I acted like a dickhead one afternoon but I apologised and we moved on. then towards the end of the semester a friend of hers told me ""I should be happy that she just uses me for sex"" which I didn't like hearing and confronted  her  to which she denied and we went on another break for a few months. During this time we talked a little here and their but nothing major then during January this year she called me and I invited her over to celebrate my exams finishing. We ended up having sex with each other and then she started to cry and confessed her love to me. To which I said I loved her back but we agreed that It would never work out between us right now and maybe we can try a real relationship in the future.  

A few weeks go by and she then tells me she just wants to see me again but only as platonic friends. I did feel a little hurt by this as It was a bit too soon after she had just confessed her love to me. Now after this we did kiss again one time 4 weeks ago but now last night I got the feeling she didn't want anything intimate with me as she would pull away as I put my hand on her back and I tired kissing her to which she responded ""not tonight"".

Now I'm stuck, I still care about her but I respect her wishes too and can understand why she wants to be platonic. I still really enjoy hanging out with her and partying with her, how do I go forward in this relationship as just friends as I'm finding it difficult at the moment as I miss the intimate side to our relationship.

A few days ago I was curious and wanted to know just what it was really like being a girl on these dating apps. A female friend of mine let me borrow her pictures to use on the profile and I signed up for it. One thing to note is she is kinda cute on a good day but isn't someone who your gonna do a double take if you saw them walking around. I didn't wanna use a girl who looks like a twitch streamer cause then of course I'd get a million matches and it wouldn't be much of an experiment. Also I wanna make clear I didn't respond or talk to anyone during this experiment as well.

What I found was crazy. I signed up for tinder, bumble, and a few other apps. I would swipe left on 5 people and then right on 5 and go back and forth to have a good sample size. All of them came up with the same results. I started this experiment on Wednesday and it's now Saturday and in four days I got more matches as a girl than I did in years as a guy. I was honestly shocked just how many matches I got when swiping. It did explain a lot however. It explained why I never got anywhere with these apps. A girl can just pick the best looking guy out of the laundry list of people hitting them up. To get any kind of success on these apps as a guy you have to be in the top 15%. I wouldn't call myself ugly but I'm not even close to being in the top 15% of guys. A lot of the guys that on there are super ripped versus me who naturally has a skinny body type and no matter how much I lift I cannot gain any muscle. How am I supposed to compete with these guys and why would a girl chose me when there are 10 better looking guys hitting her up? I know not all girls are into muscle guys but whatever a girl is looking for she is going to have so many different options to choose from what are the odds she chooses you? Like I said earlier I knew that dating apps were skewed but I had no clue it was this bad.

With this knowledge I can honestly say that dating apps has ruined dating for the majority of guys. Cause even if your not all that attractive as a girl you could go on any apps and have at least 50 people hitting you up after a week. Some of these girls end up developing a superiority complex because if they aren't attractive and they never really got a whole lot of attention from guys their whole life and then bam they sign up for these apps and now all of a sudden she has multiple guys a day who are down bad telling her she is an angel sent from heaven. She's never gonna care about you in specific cause she can just go online after your guy's date and have 10 better looking guys teller her how pretty she is on her apps. The only way now I feel like I could find a girl is one who doesn't use those apps and realizes what they truly are cause those girls tend to be the down to earth ones since they aren't getting attention from a bunch of random dudes everyday. I guarantee if these apps were removed from society dating would be a much more even ballpark rather than women having all the power.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,761907,public,self,Going undercover as a girl on dating apps,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7s8ks/going_undercover_as_a_girl_on_dating_apps/,all_ads,6,,,

Anyways, I could maybe slowly feel him checking out the past month or so, but he never communicated anything so it was hard to tell what he was thinking.

He eventually stopped texting me Completely the one day. I explained, can you please text me, because it makes me feel like you’re interested. 

He sent a long ass text basically saying he “wasn’t sure” if I’d fit into the farming lifestyle. He’s basically refused to communicate anything substantial since. I lost sleep and have barely ate the past couple days. I begged him to call me to talk about it, and he said he would, and I don’t think he will.

I’m 36 she’s 30 and she has been my assitant for three years. 

We text non stop and these days since she has my life down our texts are 90% not about work. 

We hang out nonstop. After hours or on weekends we do brunch and dinners. We go shopping (she pays her own stuff most of the time).

She wants to take my kids to Disneyland with me when they fly from another stat here next month. She out of the blue suggested it. 

She asked me to go to Tulum with her. She said she’d pay her half. Then a few weeks later she asked if I minded if her best female friend came. That threw me off. 

She gets upset when I mention dating. She asks to see pics of whoever I’m talking to. She never talks about her dating life. 

Yesterday we were driving and she said “We should stop at the store down the street and get a sexy toy”. Which was confusing.

She knew my traumas, insecurities, fears, she was the first girl I had sex with. She acted like she was so much in love , but after almost a year together she suddenly and abruptly changed completely and left me. One week later she was traveling with her ex to the place I told her was special to me and I wanted to go with her. That killed me inside, honestly. To this day I'm very very hurt.

He also updated his dating app (bumble) profile the day after he left. I don’t have tinder so I don’t know but if he did bumble I’m sure he did tinder. We have only really known each other for a good few weeks/month and a half I’d say. We aren’t even close to dating and haven’t really established that we’re “talking” either. It did hurt my feelings bc I felt as if he really did like me and then to see him update his profile meaning he was looking for something while on vacation just made me feel bad/hurt my feelings. I see that he uses WhatsApp bc of his status but he hasn’t reached out at all since he’s left. I believe he’s supposed to come back in four days so I don’t know if I should just wait it out or if I should just send a little message through WhatsApp just being like “Hey! I hope your trip is going great and that you’re having fun!” I miss him but I don’t feel like he misses me as much, that could just be me being insecure but I mean with the update of the dating app and not reaching out even once it just made me overthink a little and by the way we were talking before he just really made it seem like he liked me. Idk am I just overthinking? Should I wait till he gets back or send him a message? Before he left he did tell me if I wanted to message him to do it on WhatsApp and he texted me before his flight took off and said see you when I get back. But he could also message me right, like why do I have to be the one to make the first move. Any thoughts? We also have been sexually involved since the first date, this makes me feel now as if he just used me for the sex. Is that still a thing, where if they have sex with you on the first date that means they are only interested for the sex? I do want to know if he hooked up with anyone while he was there but I don’t want to seem like I am insecure about it. I was thinking of just asking him straight up (if he asks me to hang out when he gets back) but I don’t know if I should ask him before we hang out bc I feel like if he says yes then my mood will just be kind of off and I definitely would not be in the mood to have sex or anything just because I would be a little upset at least at first. Is this reasonable or am I really just coming from a place of insecurity? How should I go about asking him or finding out if he did hook up while he was gone.

Here's my reasoning for it. 

I generally like pushing slightly touchy subjects in a non-serious way to see how people respond, in the way of seeing how seriously they are taking themselves and if they can poke around the bush with me. Apparently this annoys people sometimes.

I also like to annoy people with my answers to see how they respond, not for the reason to see how far I can take them or for the fun of it all. More for the fact that I kind of want to see how they respond when annoyed/angry, and to see if they annoy me back. Also to clarify, not nagging, not insisting or whatever, literally just annoying someone.

I am also a fan of playing the devil's advocate. I like debating and throwing issues and ideas around, because I love learning or seeing and understanding a different perspective, or teach someone my perspective. I also like seeing if they are willing to see my point of view (be it something I agree with or not).

We met online and talked daily. And that eventually turned into weekly phone calls. He lives a few hours from me so we mainly just chatted through text or calls. He was everything I was looking for in a guy. I fell for him hard. It took months before we finally met in person. After the first time we met, he started going through a rough patch and we decided to put the relationship stuff on hold. We sort of picked things back up this January and we saw each other again a few months later. Only for him to tell me that he really likes me but he's not ready to be in a serious relationship as he's been super depressed and needs to work on things.

I respect that and told him I would wait for him as I don't want anyone else. And that I'll just be here as his friend for now. He told me he didn't want me to not be in his life and that he would do his best not to ignore me. But he told me that I shouldn't wait for him. It took him a month to respond to my messages.

I thought he can ease my depression and unstable mentality if I get to know him. Talking with him was one of most wonderful experiences ever. I've never felt so much joy for a long time when I communicate with someone. He was like a unicorn, full of rainbow and positivity. He was such a happy man and I was such a downer. He makes me genuinely happy, but I don't understand why I always doubt him. I keep assuming he isn't the right person for me and he was just trying to get something from me by showing me positivity. I thought he love-bombed me. 

After a few days of communicating with him on Snapchat, I realized that I'm slowly destroying our connection with my tendency to push people away because of my mental health issue. I kept giving him hot and cold treatment, kept being a downer, kept taking advantage of him to put all of my depression on him, using him as a tool to boost my self-esteem. I hurt him while he was trying to support me and encourage me. I realized that I'm too toxic for him, and he doesn't deserve to be treated like this. So I end the conversation and silently remove him from Snapchat, as a way to protect him from the chaos of my mentality.

My country has been in lockdown to varying degrees since March 2020, so I had 3 walking dates and all three guys didn't want a second date. No problem, that happens.


My issue is that I was a UK size 10 in December of 2019, I was putting on a little weight because of a leg and back injury but I was quite thin so I didn't mind and my doctor was happy to see me fill out a bit. Since the pandemic, my size has gone up to a UK 14. I also had my wisdom teeth removed, and my face swelled up like crazy for 2 weeks. My jawline hasn't looked the same since, even my roommate agreed that it changed my cheeks/jaw. I have started taking care of my diet, restaurants are closed so I haven't been doing that, and I didn't exercise regularly before the pandemic, but now I exercise daily. I actually don't mind the weight too much, I like my body more with curves.


My problem is, I haven't taken any recent photos since the pandemic because I havent been socialising and well it's been a rather boring time. I am afraid that my photos don't look like ""me"" any more and these guys think I'm a catfish. I try to send them some pics while we're chatting to give them an idea of how I look now, but the last three didn't seem to recognise me when I first walked up to them.

While I feel more like myself at this size, I'm so self conscious that men won't find me attractive. I have a date this week and I'm genuinely close to cancelling because I feel like I'm ""catfishing"" unintentionally but I don't know if this is just some sort of body dysmorphia or something.

This sparked some great discussion and so throughout the week I was thinking of a different topic to post that’s been on my mind, and thought it would be interesting to see others’ take on it. 

I’m a 29M, now single for 4 months following a 30 month relationship. Sex and intimacy was a big part of our relationship - I’d say 2-3 times per week we would find ourselves engaging in sexual activity, even at this stage of our relationship (certainly was in the 4-5x/week range at the outset). Since I’ve been single, I haven’t had sex - partly due to a lack of success from OLD, but also just from the perspective of needing to foster a quality relationship before actually having sex with someone (not really into the hookup culture). 

I’m wondering how people who may be in similar situations manage this area of their lives, as we know that sexual desire and release are one the basic human physiological needs. 

Do you find yourself thirsty for human touch, and resort to OLD to get your fix (or trying to meet people at bars/clubs etc if that's a thing wherever you live based on COVID restrictions)? I would imagine this is much easier for women than men, based on the landscape of the social media age and women being in the drivers seat online with the volume of matches they get. Do you have a consistent FWB who gets you through these times? Do you find yourself masturbating more than you usually did? 

And further to the point on masturbation: One thing that I am really trying to curb, is watching pornography. I think it sets unrealistic expectations and is an overall unhealthy habit to engage in on a regular basis. I find myself currently, due to having to masturbate instead of having human physical contact, watching porn 2-3x/week - and I can see this being an issue if I were to keep things up (no pun intended) in this regard. Are people able to masturbate using fantasies in their mind? Reading erotic literature? 

Thanks in advance for any insight - this is a bit of an interesting topic and I’m hopeful that others may possibly be wondering how others cope in a similar situation. If you could also mention in your responses age/gender/how long you’ve been single that would be great to add some additional context :)",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,762233,public,self,Sex/Intimacy Following a Break Up,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7x1tz/sexintimacy_following_a_break_up/,all_ads,6,,,

2. Different people get different treatment. Sounds like common sense but I’ve seen people deny this. Some people get the red carpet treatment from the start. Some women get offered a date at a nice sit down restaurant while others get offered Netflix/chill in that same guys apartment. Some men get to have sex with no strings attached for no real effort while others have to take that same girl out for multiple energy/money consuming dates in addition to long winded conversations over text to have any chance of any kind of physical contact. Even in day to day conversation, how people interact with you will depend largely on your appearance. I’m not saying it’s right or it’s wrong, it just is

3. When someone wants you to meet their friends, they’re doing it so they (their friends) can judge you. Again, sounds like common sense but people will deny it. It’s a potential trap so tread carefully

Wanted to get some opinions as my sis thinks I may have overreacted. 

I unfollowed / Unfriended him on everything because I thought he was basically ghosting me and I thought it’d make things easier to move on.

He barely texted me this week, so I let him know that makes me feel that he’s not into me. Keep in mind he used to communicate a lot more, and he’s literally always on snapchat.

So yesterday morning , he sends me a long ass text saying he isn’t sure if I’m “a good fit” for his farming lifestyle. I texted back I’m totally into him, and about his lifestyle. Didn’t hear from him for the rest of the day. 

This did make me very upset and kind of made me assume he was dumping me.

We also always hang out on weekends, and he made zero plans to do so. 

I call him later that night. He doesn’t pick up, asks if we can talk tomorrow.

I told him this morning I’ve barely been sleeping because of this and to please just call meASAP. He says he will call shortly. He doesn’t.

That’s when I did all the unfriending and bullshit.

He just got back to me now, saying he’s sorry didn’t mean to put me off, things got busy. I said I assumed the worst.

So recently I've been trying to get into dating (hard enough with aspergers), and until recently have had little success until I matched with a women on Tinder and ended up chatting on Facebook for around a week. So far so good! (Both 23) Just to note, she has anxiety and I have depression. 

We spoke about a lot of things like hobbies, goals and what we want from a relationship. She had a good date idea that was adventure golf in our city centre, which sounded great!

Fast forward to the date: I made my first mistake by saying hello and hugging her; she didn't seem to mind it but I mentally chastised myself for the physical affection off the bat. We went and played through the adventure golf and seemingly had a good time!

After that I asked if she'd mind if I put my arm around her shoulder to which she said she didn't mind. I then asked if she'd like to hold hands and she also said she didn't mind. So we walked around trying to find a coffee place that wasn't just takeaway only and eventually got into one. We spoke for a good while about, well, everything! I asked if she would be alright if I occasionally just held her hands across the table and she said she was alright with it, although in hindsight it sounds weird. A running theme is that I don't know how to act socially in these situations, I just wanted to show that I was physically as well as mentally interested without going too far if that makes sense? I always asked permission before doing any of these gestures (aside from the hug which again was my absolute fault). We continue chatting from there onwards and have a really good conversational back and forth about our lives, family, friends and life in general!

Anyhow the date ends and after a while I ask her on Facebook if she would like to go on another one to which she replies that she's realised she isn't much for physical affection and doubts she would be able to mesh well with me due to that as well as not wanting to lead me on. Fair enough really we all learn something new about ourselves and I appreciated the honesty! She wished me the best in finding someone more ideal as I did for her but I wonder if I could have made it work if I wasn't as physically affectionate?

My biggest fear is coming off as creepy but I find it hard to pick up on facial and physical body language and I'm worried for my future dates if I don't improve on this. I found her really attractive as she was definitely my type of women but I suspect I'm rambling at this point. I just want to know how to improve from here on out? I think part of me wants a relationship so badly that I plan ahead without thinking that things might just not work out which happened to happen today, but yeah any advice or tips for what I could have done better as well as what I should do better in future dates would be much appreciated!",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,762434,public,self,"First date in ages today, she didn't want to go on another one afterwards, what to learn from this?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/n7zvit/first_date_in_ages_today_she_didnt_want_to_go_on/,all_ads,6,,,

Why does online dating have to be so hard? I'm not the type of person to go out to bars and make conversation with random girls.

I've had both tinder and bumble for the last 7 months and have gotten very little matches. All which lead to her no longer messaging me or most recently cancelling a first date without any communication afrer. Its frustrating, I put the effort in to continue the conversation, I put the effort to message back whenever I get the chance compared to other people that play that stupid wait a day between texts game.

I'm just craving the thought of meeting someone and forming a relationship becasue I value who iam and know what I can offer to someone.

It ended up not happening, he cleaned like shit and when I was super sick he did nothing, not even his part, if I didnt reminde him he wouldnt do it.

I feel so hurt, not at him but at the world, at the cruel world he live on where just because I was born with a pair of boobs I get so much shit.

Everytime I have to say ""take the trash"" ""its your turn cleaning"" ""dont let your clothes on the floor"" I get so much shit.

The third date which was today was the worst one where we met up and walked around then we talked at a table in her backyard before she made an excuse to leave. I thought it went well where we had good conversation but I made a mistake of leaving my weed pen in her car which I think may have made her mad. After I picked up she texted me saying we aren’t compatible and she blocked me everywhere. This has never happened to me before where the girl makes an excuse to leave or blocks me and I can’t help but feel like there is something wrong with me. I’ve also been getting blown off by both of my fwb in this same time period so I feel like every girl is just suddenly turned off by me and I don’t know why. This is the lowest I’ve ever felt in terms of confidence and I feel really bad about it . I don’t even want to go on dates anymore because this keeps happening and it’s painful and hurts my confidence also.

Well today he texted me again saying he really likes me. I didn’t respond so he sent another message asking if he did anything to upset me. Do I ask him to clarify if he thinks I have autism??

How can I tell a difference between flirting and objectification? What can I ask my therapist to help me? I keep having short relationships. How can I work on myself now to do myself and my future partner justice?

I'm(18f) trying to work on being very clear of my boundaries. Because of a terrible traumatic past experience I'm not meeting people right after talking to them especially online as I want to feel comfortable with them as far as dating muchless friends.

I think a problem I have is I give everyone a chance. I really really really need to figure out how to not to keep letting people who want to just use me for their needs without regard for mine.

What is the difference between flirting and objectification? Because I feel very uncomfortable sometimes with how mostly men great and treat me right off the bat. Maybe it's because of love bombing in past familial relationships and romantic relationships.

I am in therapy, what are some things I could bring up to my therapist about this? I keep ending up in relationships that don't last more than a month. I have been justifying it as seeing red flags and running away but could I be just running when I see any sort of conflict? 

Idk it's a lot of questions but for now I'm taking a break from dating people just because I definitely had a terrible experience recently that really just made me scared of dating or anything romantic.
