0,p83bir,1629458920,Mental health issues…where to begin,"So I was talking to this guy and he told me that he was having some mental health issues which I’m ok with because I have gone thru that myself too. Thing is he is only going through it now in his mid twenties which I went thru at 18. Ok no problem. After some talking I decided a relationship would be a horrible idea because mental health take priority and he needs to focus on himself. I said that we cannot have sex because if we do then technically that’s FWB which I won’t do. I’ve been there done that no thanks. 


Well last night he starts telling me he wants to kill himself. That I completely ruined his day by saying we can’t have sex or have a legit relationship (I have my own stuff to work through still) I told him I’d love to be friends and im happy to be there for him as a friend. He said he’s been throwing up all day because of me. I was out with friends most the night and he tells me he has another girl in his bed rn because I fell short. Then later tells me he lied and was testing me. He called me EIGHT TIMES in a span of an hour and wud curse me out and hang up. He was crying also. His texts were not making any sense. He literally ruined my night. I was out with my friends and looked and felt amazing and he completely fucked it up. I need to drop him but the dudes mental health isn’t ok either.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p83bir/mental_health_issueswhere_to_begin/
1,p83blu,1629458930,Relationship Advice,"Hello! I’m (M23) currently in a steady relationship with my fiancé (F22). Love her to the moon and back, but since we’ve been together for a little over 4 years now, there’s still some things we need to work on.

One of the things I’ve noticed recently is that she tends to get irked when things don’t go her way and expresses it quite clearly. For example, if I hang up before she’s ready to end the conversation, or if I want to go to bed before she’s ready to, then she gets upset. It’s nothing major, as she’s back to her usual self the next day, but it’s annoying. I usually find myself compromising with her to find some middle ground. 

I only just noticed that when she does these things, she just tells me what she needs (for hanging up and going to bed) and usually I just say okay because I’m fine with it. 

Should I be more assertive and less compromising with what I want? Or am I just overthinking this and just need to accept this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p83blu/relationship_advice/

3,p83kcg,1629459954,Downloaded and deleted bumble in the same afternoon.,"I had been trying to figure out what app to download and I impulsively just downloaded bumble after some deliberation. 
I started trying to register in app. They want you to add pictures like you're supposed to talk about yourself through pictures. I read some of an article about making it better. 
I realized I didn't want/need a girlfriend, I just need therapy. I don't know how to describe myself, I'm too much of a generalist to be picking one thing or I don't really have ""hobbies"" like you do things for money and convince yourself you enjoy them, but it's mostly not pure enjoyment because I suffer from such extreme anhedonia that if there's less than x reasons for me to do it (each reason having emotional bearing and economical value) then I'm probably not going to do it or maybe put it off. They want you to mention positive things about yourself, I mostly just see negatives. Like I'm unaware of good qualities and just mostly have found it easier to neglect emotional attachments with other people and now don't know how to solve the problem. I really just find myself never able to speak my mind though I spout opinions they aren't necessarily what I actually believe or how I perceive it I try to be austere and stoic and focus on material goals cold hard material goals.

4,p83lji,1629460095,A lot of guys on this subreddit do not listen when women give you advice. LISTEN!,"I notice anytime a woman comes here to give advice on things most women dislike, detest, wants you guys to stop doing, express what peaks her interest in men, or and what would make her interested in you. Guys in the comment section:

**""Well as a guy I see no problem"", ""I wouldn't mind if a girl did that why should you care if I (a male) does it"", ""I don't care what women like"", ""Well women do this...."", ""Well you guys have it easy you know nothing"", ""I don't need your advice, dating will suck either way""  ETC.**

The point of advice targeted to men is to help you. You guys have flooded this subreddit with your stories/issues/dilemmas (and frankly speaking belittle women's issues/stories/dilemmas), but when the very demographic you are interested in tries to help you you disregard it. So do you guys want an echo chamber of men who suck at dating, giving advice to you, when they cannot seem to get it right? If so let us know, then women will stop trying to help. I don't get it....  **Take the advice.** It won't harm you to start being more open. **Also please stop disregarding women on this subreddit. Dating is hard for all not just you.** And here is my advice:

Men whom are open to hearing women's point of view is a turn-on. Men who do not disregard our desires, wants, and wishes is a turn on. Men who do not insult other women in their profile is a turn on. Men who aren't aggressive is a turn on. Men open to sharing experiences and opinions is a turn on. Men who respect women is a turn on. And when I say turn on I mean mentally, emotionally, and romantically stimulating not sexual.

I am sure this will get kick back, and yes I am a woman. Just my advice take it or leave it.

&amp;#x200B;

*Edit:*

**People in the comment section have asked me to prove men do not listen to our advice, and that males disregard our issues. Well if you take to the comment section right in this very post you will see both. Proving my point. I will be honest. I came here because it is therapeutic for me to give advice. I have had great success in dating, and it is always a treat to help others. After my most recent traumatic experience I assumed I could come back here for the same sort of help. But this space no longer seems safe for women who seek to give advice and give advice.**

**I think women should be able to give advice and not be meant with sexist replies like well you guys are always victims, or you guys are more emotional and irrational (both comments can be found in the comment section here). I think if a woman comes here seeking advice she should receive the same empathy and sympathy as her male counterparts. I also believe that if she wishes to give advice it should not be made invalid because of her sex or preference. This sub is no longer as space where women can give and receive advice safely. And for that I think mods should truly look into it.**

**The men here are having trouble indeed (I am not disregarding that), but somethings being said here proves that women are not going to receive the same quality care as men do. And that is sad and sick. Dating subreddits like this are suppose to be unbias, handle everybody with the same care, and not spew misinformation that demeans one side. This sub is no longer that. Good luck to everyone here. And women please be careful, some of these males here truly do not like you.**",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p83lji/a_lot_of_guys_on_this_subreddit_do_not_listen/

8,p841ho,1629461866,Should I (23F) Go Out on a Date with this Guy (23M)?,"I'm (23F) going on a date on Saturday with a guy named Chris (23M). I'm not sure if I should. 

Before talking to Chris, I was talking to a guy named Ash (23M). Ash and I hooked up, and it was horrible. He pressured me the whole night to fuck without a condom. At one point he got on top of me without one, and I didn't say no. I know, it was dumb. I was extremely nervous. The next day, I blocked him. Then I started talking to Chris. 

I told Chris that I wanted a fwb situation because I'm not in a place in my life where I can support a healthy relationship. He agreed. I asked him about condoms, he said he had no problem using them. I asked him if he could get tested (fully expecting him to not want to) but he agreed. I told him I would get tested also before having sex. He said that he wanted to get tested in general, not just for me. We talked for one day. 

I had gone through this speech with guys before. I've been attempting to find a solid fwb for a while. I had talked about it with Ash. The thought of having to be in that situation again, (being pressured into fucking without a condom) scared me. Chris was also acting strange. I would ask him questions, he would answer, but wouldn't reciprocate. 

So, since we had been talking for one day, I stopped talking to him. The next day, I got a text from Chris. I had forgotten I had given him my number. He told me he bought a 10 panel test that covered all STD's. He was about to walk into the office to get tested. I told him that I was interested. I tried talking to him again. He would answer, but it still seemed like he didn't want anything to do with me. 

I also explained to him part of the reason I unadded him was bc something bad had happened a few days ago. I was scared of it happening again. He told me that he wasn't that person. He told me that if we didn't have sex, he would be fine with that. He thinks I'm a ""cool"" person. He barely knew anything about me. His words were sweet, but seemed not genuine. He asked if we could hang out. I said yes, but was very hesitant. I ended up not hanging out with him. 

Once again, the day after we were supposed to hang out, he texted me. He said he got tested, and he should have the results back within a few days. He asked me if I was still interested. Part of me was surprised he actually went through with it. Part of me just wanted him to leave me alone. I didn't know why he wanted to be in contact with me if he didn't want the ""friends"" part within fwb. I also, like I had said, was scared of being in the same situation I had been in a week prior. 

He once again told me he wasn't that person, was fine with it if we didn't have sex. I asked him to hang out and smoke. He agreed. I went to his house, and we talked, smoked, and played video games. I was extremely on edge, but he did everything he could to make me feel comfortable. He didn't pressure me. He even told me when his roommate would be coming home, not in a way to tell me to leave, just so I would know someone else was coming home. 

I appreciated it. I asked him if I could kiss him. We made out, and it was the most intense makeout session I had ever had in my life. Our rhythm's were in exact sync, which never happens for me. We were both shaking from how much we wanted each other. We ended up going to his bedroom. I gave him blowjobs, and I made him cum twice. That was the extent. He agreed that it was amazing and wanted to do it again. 

The next day, I couldn't help but feel he made me feel safe just so I would give in to him. He still wasn't interested in getting to know me. It's all one sided. I asked him if I could take him on a date to apologize for blowing him off, he agreed, but I just don't know if I should anymore. He also has sent me pics of some of his results already. I thought that a fwb situation meant you could be casual friends, but it seems like he wants nothing to do with me. 

Tl;dr: Hooked up with Ash (23M) prior to talking to Chris (23M). Ash (23M) pressured me to not wear a condom, ended up getting on top of me without one and I was too nervous to say no. Blocked him the next day. Started talking to Chris about fwb. Asked if he could get tested, wear condoms, he said yes. We talked for one day. Within that day, I decided against it bc I was scared to be in another situation like I experienced with Ash. 

Next day, get text from Chris asking if I'm still interested bc he bought a 10 panel std test. (He got tested in general, not just for me.) I brushed him off the two times he asked to hang out, bc I wasn't sure if I was comfortable. He told me he was fine if we didn't have sex, because he thought I was a cool person. (Although he's never asked me anything about me.) I said okay, and asked him to hang out. He made me feel safe, didn't do anything I didn't want to do, we had an intense makeout session. I asked him if I could take him on a date to make up for the times I brushed him off. He agreed. He still isn't asking questions about me.

16,p85cpt,1629466630,I (27m) want to thank a (25f) that dumped me for something she encouraged me to do,"
I’ll try to make this short. We dated for 5 weeks and went on over 10 plus dates. There was a lot of stuff that happened during our time together. She was dealing with some previous issues from bad relationships and I definitely was getting some dating anxiety over the whole thing. I probably pushed too hard and was definitely into her. She ended it saying she didn’t feel a connection. I understood and said for her to reach out if she ever changes her mind or wants to chat. That night she accidentally texted me and said yeah he took it well. I thought this was hilarious and said yeah I though I did well. We chatted a bit about anxiety. 

Several days later I threw out the idea of possibility being friends. She said yeah that would be fine. I told her to just let me know if you ever wanna do something. That was the last conversation we had. This was about a month ago. 

One thing during my short time dating her was that she encouraged me to try to step out of my comfort zone and join a church by myself. I told her I was uncomfortable going by myself. Well since we parted ways I’ve found a great church and a fantastic small group and all. I mean my social life has skyrocketed and I’m having a blast. I didn’t really have much going for me when I was dating her. 

I was thinking about reaching out to her just to say something like “thank you for giving me a push I needed. I found a great group and I’m having a blast. Hope you are doing well” It’s really helped me and I really needed something like this. However, she was the one that dumped me. Typically in the past I never reach out again. I want to respect her wishes by going away and I don’t think I should date her again. However, part of me wants to tell her that she helped me. 

What would you recommend I do? Ok to send that text after a certain time period? Or just let go since I’m not sure if this type of message would benefit her in any way?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p85cpt/i_27m_want_to_thank_a_25f_that_dumped_me_for/

There's a girl (22) who's been my old acquaintance since high school, but we haven't been in touch for a very long time. Recently we started texting each other about different casual stuff. However occasionally she sends me those telegram ""porn"" stickers and memes that revolve around sex, I also do that.  


So, we have arranged a meeting next week, but the place and format aren't decided yet. Simply hanging out in the park or somewhere else can't be central part of the date for sure since she clearly said she's bothered by hot weather which may stay this way still - and we can't solve this by going out in the evening, because she lives outside the city and it'll be too late for her returning back to her home, where she lives with parents.

Considering all this and the fact that I live with parents too, I don't hope to have sex right off the bat, but I guess I can expect kissing and touching each other here and there. Also I don't mind if there's a potential for something more than sex.

So I'd like to hear an advice on a place and format of the date which gives us potential for sexual intimacy (which I won't force her to, but will be ready for). We already know each other good and don't need that cafe meeting where we talk just like all the people aroud us. The best thing I thought about is still drinking some coffee in cafe, but with more isolated places, where she doesn't have to think about public as much (remember, no hanging out).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p86haf/a_girl_is_into_me_need_a_suggestion_for_a_date/

Tried posting this on [r/datingoverthirty](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/) but apparently lurkers aren't allowed to post lol.

I (30F) recently entered the dating scene (bumble &amp; hinge) after a 3-year situationship which I very well know I should have ended a lot sooner than I did.

Within one or two dates, every guy I've tried ""dating"" so far has really only been interested in sleeping with me instead of actually getting to know me first. These guys have all been relatively in my same age bracket (29-35) and I've tried to make it clear that I want to take things slow and get to know each other first. I've ended up sleeping with these guys way sooner than I would have liked because I felt pressured (don't get me wrong, it was still consensual and fun). Then a few ""hangouts"" later and they're no longer interested. I say ""hangout"" because I try to turn them into dates by suggesting or even making plans to go out somewhere, but the guy always just ends up wanting to hang out at my place or his and have sex.

Am I giving off some kind of vibe that I can change? It's getting me down that I can't find anyone who wants me for more than my body.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p875gm/how_to_weed_out_the_guys_who_only_want_one_thing/

I have no problem matching with people. I dont get a ton but i get some matches so thats not really the issue here. My issue is that it always feels like its my job to carry every single conversation and it really sucks the joy out of meeting new people. 

Im good at being descriptive about what i like and ill leave little leads in the conversation to give them something to talk about buts its really rare i get thought out replies. Its usually just a simple sentence that gives very little to go off of. Theres no effort on their part to get to know me at all and it kinda hurts. 

Maybe my online game is just trash but honestly idk if i care anymore. Old stopped being fun a long time ago. I know women have alot of options online but i shouldn't feel like i have to be an entertainer for every person i meet.

When i meet someone I usually try to get to know them through their intrests and see if we like the same things. I like to talk about travel and the places ive been, my favorite sports and hobbies, my goals and what im looking for. Things that would take the edge off if we were to meet. I dont think it sounds booring

I hope i dont sound like im whining because thats not my intention. Im just tired i guess and more than likely stuck in a rutt. If anyone has advice id love to hear it, specifically from the women.

53,p88nm5,1629476826,Just thought I would share my experience,"I (21F) have been seing a lot of negative posts about dating, and discouraged people, so I just thought I'd tell my story.
After going on my first date with this guy from my class and having my first kiss at 18, he turned out to be a jerk, ignoring me and totally chancing the tune of our conversations. Weeks after that first date and kiss, I finally got him to admit his lack of interest and things ended for good. I was feeling on top of the world after the admission, because all the stress from his change of attitude was finally over, and I was just super happy (weird I know ahah). 

That same night I went out with a girl friend and she ended up meeting with a friend at a bar while we were out and that friend took someone with him as well, who I thought was cute, but I just wanted to dance and have fun after the past depressing weeks. I ended up seing the guy who was with my friend's friend again in group situations on other ocasions and we changed contacts. He was super shy and I always had to take initiative but after 5 weeks of knowing eachother we finally had our first kiss (my second ever) and started having more alone dates. After 2 months he asked me to be his girlfriend and I couldn't bem happier. We eventually lost our virginity to eachother (I was about to be 19, he was 21) and now we've been together for more than 3 years. I couldn't be happier and I feel like I've found an angel. The spark is stronger than ever, we have the most fun and promote the best on eachother, we travel together, have the most amazing talks, can discuss everything without fighting and are both eager for our future together. Our relationship is so good that it has become a joke between me and my friends that my boyfriend is now the standart for their future boyfriends. 
I think the secret is to take a chance, and if you end up finding someone good, protect the relationship. Always be honest, but talk about the problems gently, always considering the other person's feelings, and show your feelings and that you apreciate your partner. Love is a beautiful thing, and I was lucky enough to have found the love of my life on my first (and hopefully last) boyfriend.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p88nm5/just_thought_i_would_share_my_experience/
54,p88uxv,1629477457,Dating out of preferences,"Hello guys, i need advices with a situation that i found out is presenting itself a lot in my life. Since i was in my teens, i always felt strongly attracted by tall girls, taller than me mostly, and i feel that this has seriously hurt my romantic life, because most of the time i only approach girls that are noticeably taller than me (and with me being 5'8"" and a half the pool is pretty limited). I've had crushes on shorter girls at times, because i liked other things about them, but it only happened a few times. My dating experience at the moment is 0, and i think this has a lot to do with that. Given that i never dated anyone, i'm not even sure of what i'm looking for in a girl for instance (even though i'm pretty sure i want a long-lasting relationship) . 

I spent the last three years trying to put myself together again, solve a severe lack of confidence, self esteem issues, and loneliness problems. Right now i'm pretty happy overall, and given that we're are (hopefully) coming out of the whole COVID situation, i want to put myself out there again, been cultivating new hobbies, building social circles, and i wanted advices for how to avoid self-limiting my dating pool that much. 

I hope that this post doesn't come off in the wrong way, i don't want to fetishize or objectify girls of above average height, it is just that is one of the first things that i notice in a girl, and one of the things that i like the most phisically.

58,p8991v,1629478663,Girl rejected the third date after saying our chemistry was too amicable.,"I matched with a girl on Tinder back at the beginning of July after just starting on Tinder (I think she was my first match). We pretty quickly hit it off and had many of the same interests. 

After talking back and forwards for a few days I asked her to meet up. She said that she was not good at meeting people so quickly and would rather get to know me better before meeting up. I agreed to wait, and we would talk almost every day and often for hours about almost anything and I felt like she actually cared about me and showed interest in my life as I did in hers. 

Because of our schedule and vacation etc., it ended up being about a month before we finally met up, but we would still talk to each other every day during that month and have deep conversations.

She said that she liked board games so our first date was at a board game cafe. After playing games and talking for about three hours we decided to grab some food. We decided to get take-a-way and eat in on a bench by a canal. Overall the first date went extremely well and when I came home I asked if she wanted to do something together again soon. 

She said yes to a second date, and agreed we should grab a drink about a week later. During that week between the dates, we would still talk for hours every day and overall I believe our chemistry was great.

The 2nd date comes and after two drinks each, we decide to once again grab some food and eat it by the same bench we did during the first date. Once again I believe the date went very well.

When I came home later that night, I asked her for a third date. The next day she replies that she had a great time on our dates, but she felt that our chemistry was too amicable and I believe she saw me more as a friend. 

Reflecting back at our texts and dates I can see that there wasn't too much flirting. During our dates, we would playfully touch each other but not much more than that. When we walked next to each other I wanted to hold her hand but I never had the courage / saw the right moment to do so. 

I believe one of the reasons why I didn't flirt more with her is because I didn't want to blow it by going too fast, but I think that me not doing anything was more detrimental than me not doing anything.

62,p8a276,1629481147,My (25M) gym crush approached me today,"Alright, I need to put my thoughts into writing and I'd love to see what you guys think.

There's this girl who I always see at the gym. I'm there pretty much 6 days a week so we are both pretty dedicated I guess. I've always thought she is really attractive and I appreciate her consistency and hard work, hence the gym crush. 

I've probably seen her in there for the past month or two. We have both caught each other staring and I've wanted to talk to her, but the stereotypical ""don't approach a girl in the gym"" has definitely held me back.

Today, she came up to me and started talking about how she always sees me in here and she respects my dedication (I told her the same). She was saying how she is impressed and so on, and she even said I look great.

She was very cheery and even though she had me flustered, we talked for a couple minutes on our school background, what we're doing now, etc.  (I'm not doing the interaction justice describing it right now).

I didn't ask for her number or insist on giving her my number that instant because for some reason in my head I was thinking that'd be desperate. Basically, self doubt kept me from giving her my number right then.

The good thing is like I mentioned earlier, I see her there all the time. So I think the next time I see her, I'm going to just go up to her and tell her I appreciated her approaching me and that if she's interested, she can have my number.

But for some reason I'm still having some doubts on if that's the right thing to do. I know she pretty much did all the hard work of making the first move and the opportunity is practically screaming in my face, but I always have this mind fog that forms some self doubt about situations that could go well for me.

Forgiving, understanding etc. he’s never called me out my name or even cursed at me. 

This past April, I had a incident where I acted out of character &amp; he had to physically move me (I was tipsy) out the way so he could just use the bathroom. I’ve beat myself up for the incident because it was just so out of character. I’d like to add this year has been a lot for me, I’ve had a lot of deaths in my family so it’s been overwhelming.

My anxiety has been through the roof &amp; now it’s like I search for the bad in him to find a way to leave or I’ll over analyze things he say. 

About a month ago, we were in the car &amp; we were playing a questions game &amp; my question to him was “name something you’ll never do again?” &amp; he said “oh I’ll never put my hands on you again” (mind you he never has except for when he had to me move me when I was drunk &amp; blocking the bathroom door &amp; even then he was still calm) &amp; I had a whole breakdown &amp; he was like “I didn’t mean it like that, I meant I never want to be in a situation where you’re drunk &amp; I have to move you or literally put my hands on your body so that you’ll stop being aggressive” but I still was like “oh no, so you’re saying that last time you did?” &amp; he just looked at me confused. 

Moral of the story, I feel like I’ve been crazy &amp; just driving myself crazy with the “what if’s”. He’s broke down &amp; told me how much he hates that i think he’s a bad person or some kind of monster. I know this sounds crazy but like how do I stop? Do I have legit concerns?

71,p8aqai,1629483235,When to give up and when to respectfully/persistently continue showing interest?,"I met a woman through OLD. She was going to be moving to my city and so we talked for a 3 or 4 months (phone, text, facetime) as she was getting ready for her move. We had a good chemistry and our personalities seemed to be clicking well with a lot of flirty banter and teasing.  Sometimes we would talk a ton and every day but then she would just suddenly stop talking to me and I would think she might be about to ghost me but then when I initiated the conversation, she would flirt again just like previously.  She is a nice girl type, barely posts on social media, not at all attention seeking (As many ppl on social media tend to), very honest and classy, highly academic and shy/conservative on topics like sex. 

Once she moved to my city we had the 4 dates:

**Date 1:** I took her out to dinner and we walked around the city afterwards. I got the impression she is very shy and conservative so I did not end up making any move after the first date. She thanked me for an amazing evening. 

**Date 2:** We met up for quick desert during the week and both of us have early work hours and demanding jobs so we only met for an hour and just had the desert and shared stories about how we grew up and stuff. There was still no kiss or anything but I thought it was ok because it felt like she was the type to go slow in terms of intimacy. 

**Date 3:** We spent half a day together, went bowling, and then went to dinner. I wanted to make a move for the kiss when dropping her off but I honestly chickened out at the last second and didn't do it. Otherwise, it was really fun for both of us and she messaged me afterwards saying she had a great time. We also made a bet that the if she won the bowling game, I take her out to this romantic place and if I win, she gives me a massage. 

**Date 4:** She invited me to her place for drinks and dinner. I thought this would be the chance to finally get the first kiss. However, it was very hard. I tried to sit close to her but she didn't really respond well and kind of froze up. Or I would move her hair out of her eyes and still not really much of a positive response back but kind of just no response. Then I tried to playfully give her a massage on her shoulder and she said ""ooo that feels good"" but then 20 seconds later she said ""ok now it kind a hurts"" and then moved away. When we were on the couch watching a movie, I tried to put my hand on her thigh but again no response and so I didn't feel like I was getting any green lights, to make any move.  I was frustrated and confused and so finally, as I was leaving, I just asked her if I can kiss her good night and she said yes and so we had a short kiss and then I went home. 

Then a week later she told me that she enjoys spending time with me but ""I think it is more as a friend."" I respectfully said that I do not do friends and she said she understands.  I told her best of luck to her and that was it.  So I have two questions:

**(1) What went wrong here? Is it probably because of my slowness to go for the kiss? Did that make things become more platonic? I also felt like I was texting her too much which sometimes can be a turn-off.**  

**(2) Since the friend convo, I have completely stopped texting and talking to her but she always sends me a message whenever I post on social media with comments like ""oh wow where are you?"" when I posted a thing where I was out and having fun. I still really like this girl and I want to kind of try again but is it a lost cause? It feels like she could be slightly opening the door to keep things open, and if that is true, how would you approach the situation going forward? What steps to take to reverse some of the ""friendy"" feelings she might be having right now?**",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p8aqai/when_to_give_up_and_when_to/

73,p8avjx,1629483685,is there a chance still?,"So, basically me and this girl have been dating for 9 months. And we both left relationships to be with each other. The very beginning was amazing and then about 6 or 7 months in things flipped in me to where I became toxic, psycho, and controlling. We working on it, and she was giving multiple chances. I would question her every single move when she's never done anything wrong in the slightest, and I would drag things out for way too long. There would be times in the past 1-2 months when I would make the changes and things would get better. My drinking started to be uncontrollable as well. She has 2 kids - one is a boy who is 4 and another one that is a girl that is 6. No matter what her kids love me and cried when she told them I was leaving. On Wednesday, she hit a breaking point and told me she will give me one final chance and then 3 hours later she went to her parents house to pick up her kids and she came home and said she still wants to break up. That her parents pulled her aside, and think there's a bunch of red flags and I have very similar qualities that I have to her ex husband. There are charges on my record too that her parents brought up, but they should have never happened to me in the first place. My charges were in 2014 and another in 2015. My ex knew about the charges within a month of us dating, and believes me. She told me that her parents brought that up that potentially be used against her for leaving bad judgement if she gets tried for a custody change in court ever. We went on vacation about a month ago, and there are times when I would drink and i thought nothing of it since i was vacation but her parents brought that up to her as well. She has told me she can't be with a person who questions her every single move when she's done nothing wrong and that she's tried breaking up with me for weeks, but I kept convincing her that I can make all the changes. Finally on Wednesday we were good then she went to her parents house and then broke the news to me. We work together so this won't be easy. She's told me she will be there for me as a friend and to move on and to find another girl. It's crazy to me because a few nights ago she told me she loves me so much and we cuddled all night and she was giving me one final chance before she talked to her parents. I sent her a text yesterday, asking and telling her I would do whatever in this world to savor this like not drink anymore, there can healthy coparenting with her ex, and i would go to therapy. I said literally anything you want me to do I would, and she said ""If you make everything change 0.05% after a long time.""

It's like if a Guy says: ""I'd wanna date a girl who's attractive, slim or pretty"" ,why is that some other Women get offended? Like can't he really have a choice and a preference? 

That guy gets insulted and gets called: ""too shallow"", ""lower your ego bro"", ""good, die single"" or ""why won't you date a girl who has good personality, looks don't really matter"". Like he can do whatever tf he wants to ain't it? At the same time some 4'11 girl wants a 6'3 guy or an obese girl wants a muscular dude(which I'm absolutely cool with).

But when a guy asks for the same preference (pretty, hot, slim or busty), why's he been hated on? I have seen Women been picky over a Guys looks, why is that it's just an offense if it's the other way around?

What's wrong if a Guy prefers a busty girl over a flat one (without being an ass?) Or what's wrong if a Gym dude wants a woman with a sexy hot body? Isn't having a preference a two way street?

We’ve been talking for 3 months &amp; the first month was great. It was that honey moon stage and we practically we're in a unofficial relationship.  

Which around the 2nd month that scared him with how close we were getting so he started to pull away from me because Hes dealing with alot. 
He might be moving in 6 months (unlikely but he wants to) and hes current living situation Hes really unhappy with. So he usually comes over,  sometimes have s*x but not always and vents to me. When that happens I feel like we do grow closer together because he always comes to me but I feel like this is something a girlfriend should be doing.

I'm frustrated because it's not like Hes sleeping with anyone else but he hasn't tried to ask me to be his girlfriend. Like I said I'm unhappy because I don't know how to tell him that I don't want to continue what we have since it's affecting me mentally. 
I don’t want to force him to be in a relationship with me/ obviously don’t want to stop talking to him but I need to make the hard choice of telling him he needs to commit or he has to let me go. 

Im scared to tell him that since he is dealing with a lot, which maybe is the reason why he hasn’t asked me &amp; maybe I’m being impatient since he does show vulnerability.

85,p8cd4a,1629488425,Crazy people on Dating Apps,"Okay so this is a bit of a rant but also a word of advice.

If you're someone who lives a bit of an 'out-there' lifestyle. I.e. a sex worker or anyone with a career or hobby that would be significant to a prospective partner. For the sake of everyone's sanity, please don't assume everyone will be okay with what you do and willing to go along with it or make exceptions to their boundaries for it.

I just got bombarded by like 8 people because I decided to stop talking to this girl who sells nsfw content; I decided to stop talking to her because while I was fine with her selling solo content, I noticed she put out a request for anyone that saw it to go to her house to have sex for content. Which I was not okay with, but like most people, I'm not a nasty person by default so rather than make a scene about it I just said that we weren't in a relationship yet and I didn't want to pursue that because I wasn't comfortable with that aspect of her work.

Next thing I know I have almost 10 people harrassing me because I should've been supportive and if I really liked her I'd accept it.

If someone isn't okay or compatible with your lifestyle, and they're polite and reasonable about it.

Then in September she told me she had feelings for me, so I told her the same. We didn’t date right after that but I asked her if she wanted to start a real relationship and she said she wanted to do we started dating each other. Then October came around and everything started falling apart. My dad took my phone away for 4 days and my heart sank as I knew I wasn’t going to be able to contact her for a while so I got really depressed because I loved her and I was going to feel so bad once I got my phone back to tell her what had happened. 4 days pass and I get my phone back by convincing my dad to give it to me. I went into my snap chat and found many messages of her telling me “why are you not texting me back” “is it something I said” “if I did anything wrong please tell me I miss you so much” “please don’t do this” are you ok??”. And other messages like that. I explained what happened and she was relieved and she understood and we got back to business. When I tried to call her after I got my phone back she would answer and hang up. Sends me a message angry at me ( I can’t remember what she said) but long story short she said she didn’t care anymore about us and I got mad for the first time and said I didn’t care aswell and just told her why she was acting different and dumb and I called quits. She said she was joking and never meant anything like that but I told her she can’t be joking like that and said just to break up because I truly loved her and when she just threw away our relationship we’ve worked hard on for many months I got a feeling so bad in my stomach I was going to cry but I didn’t.

As the title says, Im 25M living in Canada, and have never been in a relationship before but am looking to start. Although on the outside I act upbeat and positive, I've lately been feeling more depressed with the fact that I've never been in a relationship and questioning if any girl would ever date me.

A little about me....My looks are definitely not advantageous for the dating game haha. I'm 5'6, a little ugly (3.5/10 at best) and my face has acne scars from my teenage battles with acne. Also I'm asian, which from what I've heard, limits the girls that would date you (which I'm not mad about, I think girls are allowed to have racial preferences). I'm not overweight, and have started going back to the gym and I'm definitely starting to fill out a bit more.

I think I have a good personality, apart from low self esteem and being awkward at times. I'm funny, can talk to people, but I don't fit the masculine, confident archetype.

My social life sucks at the moment. Since graduating university I have drifted apart from all my friends and I have 0 friends at the moment. I know a great way to meet girls is through mutual friends, but currently that avenue is a dead end. It's hard to meet girls at work, because I work from home as a programmer.

Clubs and online dating have not worked for me. Prior to covid, I would try to ask girls to dance with at clubs but would get politely turned down. I paid for tinder gold and boost but have only gotten 1 match in 6 months. I swiped right on every girl who wasn't incredibly overweight. My preference for girls is simple, just looking for a relatively normal girl who I get along with, doesn't have a bad personality and isn't too overweight. Maybe even those criteria's is too high for someone like me haha.

Any HONEST advice would be greatly appreciated! Don't get my hopes up too high, I know dating isn't a simple as... do this one thing and meet the girl of your dreams. I'm a short, below average looking guy with no social life, I know things aren't looking good for me but I'm willing to put in a lot of effort and try.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p8czh7/25m_virgin_never_been_in_a_relationship_looking/
92,p8d2rb,1629490656,Did she have a crush on me or not?,"Would she get this upset if there wasn’t any interest at all?


Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

TL;DR: met a girl and thought we clicked. Asked her out and she told me she couldnt at the time because of a vulnerable family member(before vaccines) and I assumed she was lying.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p8d2rb/did_she_have_a_crush_on_me_or_not/

She says she loves seeing all the people when we go out. What is she really looking for? does it line up with what I'm looking for? What am I looking for?

94,p8d5d7,1629490892,"I breath through a mask at night because of sleep apnea, how much of a turn off is that?","I'm a early 20's male who uses a CPAP mask for diagnosed sleep apnea. I know that sounds very lame, but it's important for my health to wear it. I don't bring it up on the first date but eventually it will come up. I've never heard anything about it from women I've dated, but I believe they were being polite. My question to the woman of reddit is whether a guy having to breath through a mask at night is a turnoff and if so how much? I guess there's nothing I can do about it but I'm just curious",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p8d5d7/i_breath_through_a_mask_at_night_because_of_sleep/
95,p8d70p,1629491043,"Specifically for the women here who date men, at what age would you have started to be interested in a relationship with a 30 year old man?","Hey all, 

I was having this discussion with a friend and wanted to hear some other perspectives. I recently turned 30 and also recently entered the dating world again. I didn't pursue things during the height of the pandemic and before that I was in a long term relationship. So basically the last time I dated I was 28.  

It seems like a lot of the women I'm matching with are in the 23-25 range. Nothing has sparked yet, but I'm wondering if a relationship works well between women who are around 24 and a guy my age. I don't really date casually and I'm at a point where I'm dating exclusively with the objective of finding someone to marry. It's worth noting just for context that I'm a committed Christian and date other committed Christians so the objective of marriage in dating is the norm culturally. 

I guess what I'm worried about is women who are 5-7 years younger getting hung up on me being a bit older (even though I have no evidence that would happen). I wouldn't want to ignore potential matches because of that though especially if it's baseless.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p8d70p/specifically_for_the_women_here_who_date_men_at/

99,p8df3d,1629491761,"After some time, we need to have more than what we got.","Well, the scenario is like this: we have been seeing each other for several months(3-4) but it has been just casual situations. I know that he’s not really interested in exclusive relationship for now but I’m on the stage where I need more than casual hookups. I really don’t want to lose him just because I want more and he doesn’t. 

We haven’t talked about that yet, maybe because I’m somehow too afraid to ask him to level up. And maybe because I’m afraid of hearing things I do not want to hear. 

What would you do? 🥺",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p8df3d/after_some_time_we_need_to_have_more_than_what_we/
