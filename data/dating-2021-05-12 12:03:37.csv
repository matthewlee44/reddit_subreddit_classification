0,natxjr,1620839547,How to set expectations without coming off as needy,"I’ve (F24) been seeing this guy (M30) for a few weeks now. We’ve been on a few dates and recently hooked up for the first time last weekend. He made it pretty clear he’s doing his own thing, seeing other girls, sometimes sleeping with other girls, and he’s also a very busy business owner. I’m in the same boat, don’t really want anything serious but enjoy his company a lot and every time we hang out it’s never any less than 6 hours at a time and we always have a blast. I wish this didn’t happen to women so often after we get physically intimate with men but it does. Now that we’ve had sex I kind of want to communicate that my expectations are that we would talk...more.. during the week. We usually see each other once a week but he never initiates a conversation with me but he’s always the one to makes plans. He’s expressed to me that girls have gotten clingy with him in the past and I want to avoid that. I’m not expecting phone calls every night or either of us becoming exclusive but it’d be nice to get a “Hey, how’s your day going” text from time to time. Do you think that’d scare him off or that he’d appreciate the honesty? I just know my worth and know that being physically intimate with someone would take a little more effort on their part..",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/natxjr/how_to_set_expectations_without_coming_off_as/

We start seeing each others every other day for 2 weeks (and everytime we sleep over and stay until evening). It was always her who intiated texting etc. I got addicted to this girl, and wanted to be with her 24/7 (My mom passed away 7 months ago and i have a massive void, and she accidently started to fill )

One day i proposed that we should be friends because I was not sure if I liked her or if i liked the feeling she gave me. I instantly regret it and though and took it back and apologized and said lets just continue to date and see where it goes. She accepted. 

Last week was when the neediness started to show with actions,. When she wanted to leave to study etc, i asked her  to please stay another night etc. In the end it all got too much. And we had the discussion of where we stand in the relationship and she said that its best if we stopped seeing each others.

Monday I ask her how she feels and that im ready to change this neediness, and I have to understand that she has a life outside of me etc, she says ""Do you rly think it can work then""? i say i think so. She says  ""We can meet up end of week to see how we feel etc"" I tell her that I have to go the the doctor now, she wishes me good luck and I tell her that it went well, and says ""good""

6,nauj3f,1620841064,She suddenly stopped texting and blocked me?!,"So I’m in a bit of a situation and can’t figure out what in the heck is going on... Here’s the story:

Im a 20M and a couple of months ago (coincidentally on my bday), I met this girl (20F) over an app online. She lives about 6-8 hours away by drive. We clicked pretty easily and imo, we had a decent vibe going. We texted a little on the app then I asked for IG. I was new to online dating so I wasn’t sure about procedure and ended up asking her out  or for a call pretty much after getting her ig. She said she wanted to take things slow and that it wasn’t a “no”. I totally respect that and told her and we ended up chatting pretty much everyday after.

At first, our exchanges were a few hours apart (I took about an hour at most to reply while she often took 2-3 hrs). Gradually, it became 2hrs for me and 15+ hrs for her. I know, possible red flag. 

About 3-4 weeks ago, I get her number cause I’m using ig less (and I wanted to get her number). But I know she’s a double major and doing a bunch of other stuff, so she’s super busy and I get that.

Anyhoo, two weeks ago I send her a reply and boom... no reply. I was worried about her and decided to give her a week before following up. The last day before I test her, she posts a pic (arguably her at her cutest imo) on her story. I think to myself that maybe she’s still busy so I give her a few more days. A couple of days later, she posts another story about some awareness thing. Next day, I can’t find her account on ig. I use my other account and see her account so my assumption is that I’m blocked.

Over the next few days, a few minor things happen: I lose sleep worrying about why all this happened, I look back on old texts to see if I said something wrong, and I give up on the idea of dating.

Yesterday, I decide that I need to know what’s going on and text her asking her if everything’s ok. Again, no reply... yet.

As I write this, I’m eating my breakfast and trying to watch a lecture online, or a lack thereof. I’ve been thinking of why this would happen and this is what I’ve come up with:

1. She’s fallen for someone else.
2. She wants to focus on her studies/work rn.
3. I said something I shouldn’t have.
4. She’s working for the CIA undercover and can’t make contact.
I know that last one sounds a little unorthodox but I can’t figure out anything else. 1 and 2 don’t make because we previously talked about how she would reject someone (it came up in a convo about her friends) and she would be straightforward. As for 3, our texts are largely “fun-filled” and a lot of jokes. Not to mention that nothing I could have said  would even make her do this.

My plan thus far is:
1. Give her a couple of days to reply to the text I sent yesterday.
2. Call her if she doesn’t reply by then.
3. If she doesn’t pick up or if I’m blocked over text too, then I’ll text her sister asking her whats going on or if the my girl is ok.
4. If this still doesn’t work, I’ll have to go meet her in person somehow.
I need closure about what’s going on because I can’t stop thinking about her and that’s messing with my schedule.

If you guys have read this far, please tell me what you think. I’ve never been in this situation and I don’t know what to do. 

Also, I know this may not count as dating but it’s a pandemic and I really like her so yeah...

Any advice is much appreciated.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nauj3f/she_suddenly_stopped_texting_and_blocked_me/

8,naushs,1620841730,I regret going back to an ex lover,"35f I contacted an ex flame a few months ago. We hadn't spoke in over a year. We didn't date that long but we were friends first. There was always sort of an attraction there but I always detected red flags with him hence I friendzoned him. 

When we ended things it wasn't on good terms &amp; there were some harsh words said mostly on his end. He was being a jerk to me which I dont know why &amp; I was trying to come from a place of understanding. He basically pushed me away even though he was the one who pursued me &amp; went after another girl. 

After that I moved on fast &amp; started dating someone new. I quickly began developing feelings for the new guy &amp; I soon realized he was a better match for me &amp; wanted to pursue a relationship with the new guy. 

Even though I was happy with the new guy there was a part of me that still wondered about the ex. Also, my new guy got out of a relationship not too long before me so we were both healing in a sense. We were together almost a year when our relationship came to a sudden halt mainly on his part. The new guy I thought was potentially my long term partner walked away from the relationship.

I felt devastated &amp; still am somewhat. After a few months of being alone &amp; not having the energy to go back to online dating I contacted the old lover. 

He responded immediately &amp; seemed open &amp; happy to hear from me. A part of me was curious about him but I think the other part knew deep down I was making a mistake contacting him again.

We met up for lunch a few times &amp; ended up hooking up, but I knew in the back of my mind I didn't want a relationship with him. He did apologize to me for the way he treated me in the past &amp; was trying to be more affectionate with me, but actually wasn't feeling it.

After that we made plans to hang out a few times but he backed out surprisingly but I was kind of relieved. Since then he's been giving me mixed messages &amp; trying to imply he wants something serious. He's asked me my views on marriage &amp; has sent me random houses for sale. I asked him why he sent me this but he said he just thought I'd like the post. 

I feel like I know what he's trying to do. I told him I decided it was best we remain just friends because I'm still healing right now. He knows I dated someone after him. Thing is I feel like he's hoping I'll come back to him eventually, but I don't see it happening.

I realized we're not compatible in the long run &amp; there's things about his personality &amp; lifestyle I don't like. Also, I know he still flirts with other girls. I've seen it on social media. 

But I feel he keeps pushing for more &amp; I feel is obsessed with me. But I feel he's always obsessed with who he can't have. He's fickle &amp; unreliable.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/naushs/i_regret_going_back_to_an_ex_lover/
9,nauvze,1620841969,25m - Is it a red flag if someone is inactive on social media?,"Asking for OLD purposes. 

I am pretty inactive on social media in terms of posting stories and updates about my life. On Instagram my profile is set to private because I used to post relatively frequently but found it wasn't adding much other than to see how many likes I received. I do use it to send pictures/memes and generally keep in contact with people that I otherwise wouldn't text or call. 

I addition to this I also have not updated my Linkedin since graduating grad school in early 2020. The nature of employment is not really helped by these kinds of updates or interactions and in some cases may hinder it (legal adjacent). 

It may seem silly but the reason I ask is because I know part of the OLD vetting process these days is to check out someone's digital footprint to determine if they are who they say they are or to prevent catfishing, which is totally valid. 

So, am I sabotaging myself by not being active or am I overthinking it?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nauvze/25m_is_it_a_red_flag_if_someone_is_inactive_on/

(2+ years single, no action at all), they said I should contact this particular girl. A friend the girlfriend of one of the guys, quite a cute girl, seems like my ""type"". So after some cheese jokes, she asks for my Snapchat. 

We send some stupid snaps to each other, without any meaning. Next big thing happens Tuesday. She responds to my daily snap and at the end of the night, we had a good talk, felt really comfortable. Apparently she knew who I was, all the way back from kindergarten and she knows my mom. She clearly joked that she stalked me beforehand, and she was, in my opinion, flirting a bit.

As a follow-up to this, thought it would be nice to have a drink together. Talking in persons is always better. I normally wait (too) long before asking this, I figured this time I should do it earlier to show my possible intentions. 

However, when I asked if she would like to have a drink together, She simply replied that she has exams coming up and no real response anymore afterwards.

I get there is a global pandemic going on but still, even on dating apps it’s nothing games and time wasters.

And we officially broke up an year and a half ago. But then the toxic cycle of hooking back up, and then being an asshole to me over and over again, kept going on for another year and a half.

So I want to heal from it all. Now we have been no contact for over a month now. They were also dating other people, having hookups while keeping me on the side. It really affected my self confidence and self worth. 
So I just wanted to try to go out there, and try to get back out there. I m doing everything I can to work on my self esteem, be it working out, investing in hobbies, going to meetups to build confidence to talk to new people. 

But I haven’t really had a chance to try to step back into dating. I wanted to just try and talk to people and see how I feel. As a personal assessment tool also. See if I m making any progress.

14,navpzj,1620844035,Sharing Relationship History w/ Bf?,"I’ve been in a healthy, monogamous, heterosexual relationship with my boyfriend for almost 5 months, and we met almost 9 months ago. He is amazing and I feel like we match each other on so many levels- intellectually, relationship to our families, core values, sense of humor, etc. Though neither of us is in any rush, I could see myself with him for a long time and that makes me incredibly happy! 

One thing has come up a few times that’s starting to bother me enough to ask for some advice. My boyfriend has trouble talking about his own and my past relationships/partners (especially sexual history), and he has gone so far as to plug his ears and physically remove himself from the room  when I was casually talking to his roommate about some random sexual subject that I related to. 

I don't like to linger on this subject either, but I am the kind of person that’s pretty open about my past history, because I think that sharing some things is important to show your partner what you’ve learned about yourself in the context of a relationship or sex. Again, I don’t mean going over the nitty gritty details or bringing up unnecessary stories to trash talk exes or things like that.

I have some things in my relationship/sexual history that I would like to bring up to him as a way to share a little bit of my life that I’ve learned a lot from, and to deepen the relationship by being more vulnerable with him. I want to feel like I can confide in him about things that have caused me trauma, but right now him not being willing to listen is making me feel even more shameful about it. 

I don’t know how to bring this up with him without him feeling uncomfortable or jealous, because I think he really struggles with hearing about this subject. He’s been cheated on in the past and has some trauma there for sure, which I can empathize with and understand why he’s triggered talking to his gf (me) about her past partners. Is there a way I can bring this up to him in a way he doesn’t feel like I’m sharing unwanted information with him? Should I leave it alone?

I took the plunge and on Bumble said I specifically wanted an FLR. I got a ton of matches really quickly, I think mostly from women being curious about what it was. The first one and I really hit it off and seemed to have a great connection just from messaging. She had never heard of it but said she always felt more dominant and the more she looked into it and we talked about it she really liked the idea. So we had drinks at an awesome super divey bar the next day and just beyond hit it off. We've been messaging constantly and I really see it going somewhere. We've even pulled the trigger on a trip together already.

Our next date is on Friday but since she wears the pants in our budding relationship, she's coming up with the date. Which is my conundrum. I'm used to coming up with special dates when I'm interested to show how much I care but now it's out of my control. So what does one do to show it's extra special when they're not making the date?

Im not a neurotic or obsessive person, like Im not one of those types that just spams and will harass you if you don't instantly text me back. Whenever I get the number of a girl that I really like and we begin talking I always get anxious, the more dates we go on the comfortable I get however its always in the beginning that I get very anxious and I can't help myself. My mind goes all over the place, I get excited and picture her as my girlfriend and then I go to, does she really like me? Has she rejected me? Why is it taking so long for her to respond? Whenever I get the text back and remain calm and then go into my ""manic state"" and then after awhile I crash. If she just ghosted me I crash and never go back to my manic state lol.

I hate being this way but I can't help it because I cannot contain my excitement. If the girl is really cute the worse it gets for me. I just hate playing the waiting game with texting or messaging. I guess its because I've been ghosted so many times and that I am kind of a hopeless romantic that I am susceptible to this than most people. I am also pretty conscientious so when I meet a girl I really like I feel like she really is the one.

I don't get anxiety to the point that I cry abnormally or go into extreme depression, but its like 1 level below it. Its not like I have serious mental health issues. I get sad when things don't work out, I cry, pick myself up and then move on. I just hate having to go through the phase of excitement followed by crashing with dating.

Since exams ended, I did ask her out for dinner initially but she rescheduled for lunch and we had a great time a few days back, talked for three hours with almost no silence and she initiated walking about the area + dessert enthusiastically. Mustered a bit of courage at the end to ask if she wanted to go out next week and she said sure, and to arrange a time since both our internships are starting. From what I know from talking with her, I don’t think she’s the type to lead people on (she’s never had a bf before), but I’m just a little confused why the texts have become more sporadic. Should I broach the subject with her on the next date or just let it slide? Or are texts a non-indicator of interest at all because she always agrees to go out just that lengthier convos in text have kind of died since school started getting more hectic? Her actions face to face seem to show a lot of interest (comparing our first study date with lunch days ago) -eg. Some light touches and she’s always asking me to try/finish her food, offering her drink to me first",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nawonn/texting_and_dating_am_i_thinking_too_much_or_has/

Lately I(16) have been thinking about this girl(17) that has a crush on me and it really makes me wanna date her

I'll give some context

When I was at highschool I overheard that she had a crush on me and I really didn't care at the time bcuz of my depression and social anxiety,I was constantly thinking about ""ending my suffering""

 when I was in math class, I was talking to one of my friends and I noticed her looking at me, she was looking me in my eyes and when I catched her staring she didn't turned away or something she kept staring and it made me feel a little bit uncomfortable and I looked away, then she smiled and talked to her friends. The way she stared at me made me feel like she really loved me and it melted my heart honestly. 

(I'm the stereotypical quiet guy in the class that nobody talks to, she is the social extrovert popular girl in my school that is friends with everybody, so the fact that she gave me that stare really tells me something )

When I was stretching in the gym class I caught her staring again, she gave me that seductive smile,I looked away again.

(It may sound creepy but I don't really get that creepy vibes)

I remember this time when I was crying bcuz one of my ""friends"" humiliated in front of the class (i'm really sensitive btw)and then she comforted me and told me that everything was ok, she told me it wasn't that bad, it made me feel better. Again it melted my heart again bcuz none of my friends helped me, they laughed and left me alone.

When it comes to making up and fixing things afterwards, though, there is a big difference between saying ""I'm sorry I/my actions hurt you"" and ""I'm sorry if you were hurt.""

The first sentence is active- it takes accountability for one's own actions, acknowledges how their partner might be feeling because of them, and demonstrates regret, along with an unspoken commitment to be better moving forward. The second sentence is passive- it shifts the blame to the other person for their feelings and does not take accountability.

Its a subtle difference, but one that is significant when you've started to invest in a person or a relationship. Its also a very easy mistake to make yourself, and one that, if corrected, will help your partner feel seen and respected after an argument.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/naxrp7/there_is_a_very_big_difference_between_im_sorry_i/

I usually pay for myself because I just don’t like the concept of money integration in a relationship, especially in the beginning when I haven’t decided if I like the guy.

So, the thing is, he ALWAYS wanted to pay for me. Every time I said that I would handle it he refused and insisted on paying saying that he just wants to make me feel good.

And after those dates I discovered some qualities that made us incompatible. I met him for the last time saying that it wouldn’t work out.  And he said “you know, when a guy pays for a girl, he is expecting something in return”

It was so offending! I was shocked that he viewed me as someone who would sleep with a guy because he bought me a burger😖😖

58,nb0hjo,1620856364,I emotionally cheated on the most amazing woman,"So there is a lot to unpack here, I'm not sure where to start...

For relationships, one of the worst things that can damage or even destroy them is self doubt, and that might be the catalyst for the end of the relationship between I and and the most amazing woman I have met.
I have only met not even a handful of women throughout my 32 years, that I have felt a true connection with. 

I met my current partner through a dating app and has been going amazingly well, so amazing that I couldn't believe that there were no issues, until I started thinking about how this person couldn't be accepting of me. I showed my vulnerable ,anxious, shy side and she kept on telling me it's ok, that we can take as long as I want to go through the process of getting to know one another. Again the self doubt creeping in and saying""theres got to be something that isn't right"".

She has kissed,hugged and shown me love that I wouldn't have thought was possible. She has an amazing smile and a face I love to see whenever I get to hang out with her. She's very sexy, appearance, voice and her confidence. I love the way she carries herself. She's also a very optimistic person and happy and outgoing person and I love that.

This is me: Happy but have anxiety. I love to laugh and am outgoing but think too much about what to say and what I am doing. This id where my self doubt comes in- I WAS a 32 year old virgin with barely any experience in dating...and I had never kissed a woman before. 

So what I did is I started to doubt, even after we agreed to be exclusive, that things would go smooth. I also thought to myself,after someone texted me on tinder right before I was going to delete it, to just make sure I am ready to be committed. I'm not justifying this, I'm just expressing my thought process. I thought I would just text one girl and see if she could distract me. I texted her for 4 or 5 days and ended it, after seeing that I was only seeing her as a friend and nothing more.I didn't wish to meet up or see anyone, every time I saw my partner, I would forget about the girl from tinder. I realized that and stopped texting the tinder girl.

And that's another thing is that whenever I thought of my partner I would think of her as a woman, an adult, not a girl, not someone that seems like she needs to grow up. Looks like I have some growing up too.

What happened is that my partner saw my phone two times with the tinder notification on it. She confronted me and I told her about why it was still on my phone, I don't blame her for not believing me. It seems like she may believe me that I have not even met up with another woman, I would not do that unless things ended between us. 

My question is that how can this be fixed, is there anyone with experience with this same situation(emotional cheating) and how do you show that the person you cheated on,that you still truly love them and want to show comitment?

This has given me so much anxiety, that I can barely function and is definitely my biggest fuck up of my life. This just happened last night, so its hard to even function right now. It took 5 hours for me to start my day. I would be so happy if this worked, I would do anything to show her how much I care and wouldn't think about hurting her.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nb0hjo/i_emotionally_cheated_on_the_most_amazing_woman/

Been going out with this girl for two months. We actually have been in contact for over a year after we matched on an app. Couldn’t go out before because of covid.
Everything was doing good. Actually I was a bit too intimidated because she was moving too fast with me. I mean she started talking about important stuff like if we were in a exclusive relationship or official. Wanted to meet my family, asked me about my ideal home or if preferred to rent for now, or asked me about ideal wedding. Asked me to travel with her. Actually she booked trip ( only three days ) that we were supposed to go this week but I didn’t go because of this “fight”. She went with her mother instead.

So all the things she was telling me made me think she actually liked me a lot . Only that I wanted to go slower because she wanted to do everything too quick.

Now let’s get to the point of this thread :

Last week she told me that she couldn’t go out that all week because she was busy with work- so I said okay and gave her space. She was actually busy as she was working a lot, so nothing wrong here.

Coming Wednesday I notice something weird: she blocked me from her Instagram stories. I come to find out she went out with someone else and posted a story and wanted to hide from me.

I was mad/upset/surprised not because she went out with someone else, but because she blocked me, especially  after talking about how we started to trust each other more!

So I confronted her, didn’t say anything mean , only that I was surprised and we needed to communicate better. Her reply ? She was actually surprised that I found it out, and that it was better to leave things like this because we are two different people. Then I sent her another message, and she got back to me in the morning saying she needed time to make a correct decision, too many things on her head. Haven’t spoken since then, she is on this vacation, she restricted me from her Instagram ( but still watches my stories), and actually went out with guy one more time. What’s going on here ? She wants to leave me for good but keeping me around to see if this other guy is any good ? Or she was impulsive didn’t want confront me and wants to think about her actions ?

I don’t think I’m that bad of a guy. I’ve been told by my girl friends that they think I’d be a really good boyfriend but I just can’t get any girl to give me a chance. I don’t get matches on online dating, and as stated earlier, trying with girls I know typically leads to painful rejections.

I feel so ugly all the time. I lay up at night questioning why I’m so inept that I can’t even get a first date. I’m still a virgin, I’ve never done anything physical with anyone, and I doubt I’ll even get my first kiss before I’m 40. It’s honestly so depressing when I think about it, it makes me not want to get out of bed. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. I just want someone to think I’m attractive.

I’m missing out on so much. Everyone around me is experiencing what it’s like to be in a relationship. Everyone is experiencing sex. Everyone gets to experience young love but me. I’ve never told anyone this but I cry about this. I just feel so awful all the time.

I don’t want to be alone for the rest of my life but I know there’s a good chance I’ll never find anyone.

I wish I had someone to talk to about this, but no one around me can relate. My guy friends are out here having threesomes and having fun and I’m the weirdo that can’t get a girl to spit in my direction. And I can’t talk to my girl friends about things like this for obvious reasons.

We clearly showed interest in eachother and would casually flirt. One day on text things escalated and he indicated that he wanted to makeout with me to which i hinted that I'd be okay with that. The day we were supposed to meet i asked him that shouldn't he be asking me out on a date before kissing me. To which he said ' i don't mind considering it a date' ' i really like being with you' 'but, i don't think I'm ready for relationships' 
After which i called off our meetup by saying that since the both of us are looking for different things its better we distance ourselves. To which he replied for how long.
I am genuinely confused as to what he wants out of this? Is he looking for something sexual? Is he not ready yet does he need time. 
After this we haven't met, but have talked on and off on text. 
I really like him and i miss hanging out with him
But, i am afraid i will get emotionally attached to him.
Should i meet him up and ask him what his intentions are and what is it that he's looking for or should i just let it go? And move on?
A little background, in school we started talking in the last year and developed feelings for eachother. We mutually asked each other out for prom. 
A month before prom i asked him wether he was still up for it or not as even though we had feelings for eachother he didn't really spend much time with me.
Upon confronting him facetoface he didn't give me a reply or anything and i simply walked away.
I genuinely don't know what to do. I am really confused.

this, but I'll just try.

Okay, so here's my problem; I like a girl friend of
mine (from my friends group, we're all teenagers
and the group is formed by aprox 3 guys and 10
girls), but I think she's out of my range.

She's smart, understands and talks English very
fluently, she loves reading, and she's actually very
pretty. She's basically like me (except for the last
part), so I honestly think we're compatible.

But here's the thing; some months/weeks ago
discovered through other people that, if one of the
other guys in the group asked her out, she would
think and possibly say yes. This concerns me.
Luckily, that friend doesn't like her anymore.

So what's the dilemma? I don't know how to proceed.
Do l just ask her out and risk my reputation and
friendships with people on the group, do I remain
silent, do l try to give her little hints, etc.

I'm just looking for advise from more experienced
people, I've already had a couple of girlfriends but
I'm still not really ""comfortable"" in this area.

teenager, and please respond if you think you can
help.

I sometimes like to approach girls when I'm out and MOSTLY like to message them over instagram, asking them to go out sometime. 99% of them reject me when it comes to going out.

Now lets talk about dating. After 2 dates max, I already settle in and ask for a relationship or make a move. I've been in 3 unsuccessful relationships. Many girls tell me ""slow down"" or ""just wait i need time to form a decision"" and the ""decision"" takes about 3 months to form, and I don't have the patience for that because I was led on in the past a lot, and I always want a normal relationship - whether that would be serious or just something fun.

I just don't have the patience for that type of bullshit - I'm a ""take it or leave it, all or nothing"" type of guy.

I would consider myself decently attractive and have talked to multiple girls throughout high school and never really had a problem doing so. I’m a late bloomer and never really had a true friend group only had “school friends“. I was basically a very popular loner lost somewhere in the middle between being not weird enough and not necessarily cool enough everyone would approach me in school talk to me and it’s always been  extremely easy for me to strike up conversation and make people laugh. I’m not a naturally introverted person and am only happy if I’m constantly interacting with others or doing something. However I’m starting college next year and am becoming concerned about my lack of experience and how it will effect my future dating life as well as social life. Everyone tell me that I still have time to do these things but I almost feel like I am too far behind to catch up. I don’t plan on waiting for marriage or anything like that i really just would like to get it over with TBH. I’m just so scared that If I tell a girl that I am inexperienced that she will be no longer be interested in me and I will end up getting nowhere. Does anyone have any advice as to what I should do at this point it is really stressing me out? Would I be better off just lying and trying to act more sexually experienced than I am or should I just be honest? I know that I’m only 18 and not 30 but it is becoming legitimately concerning to me especially because it seems like everyone around me is much more experienced.

Haven't escalated past cuddling (I wanted to make a move on our last date, but she got up after the movie so we weren't cuddling. I really regret not trying on the prior date, though).

After the short 4th date when saying goodbye, I said ""stay in touch, alright?"" and she said ""obviously"" while smiling so I'll take that as a good sign.

Now, for the past 2 months that I've been talking to her, and even now, I ALWAYS get way too excited when I get a snap from her. I'll be checking my phone pretty often to see if she has snapped me or not. When she doesn't snap me for a while, it messes with my mood until I get a snap from her. I hate it. It's not healthy. And now that college is over for a couple months, I have more time to focus on this bs lol.

I just know that there are two outcomes this summer. 

A. She still talks to me by the end of the summer, and we start from where we ended before we left college. Here I'd be pissed because I stressed this much over her not texting me for nothing (because she's interested).

B. She ends things in the summer. Here I'd also be pissed because I stressed this much just for things to be ended.

Because of Covid, my school’s drama department couldn’t have live theater and so we’d record radio plays and upload them to YouTube. This most recent one was a super intense and fun show with two parts, each one just over an hour. It was the same cast for both parts and one of the cast members, who we will “Samantha,” was this really cute and bubbly girl in the cast who would laugh at all my jokes, especially the more terrible ones. We got along great. We sat next to each other before and during rehearsal, we’d always joke around, we even traded books recently. I was seriously considering asking Samantha out. 

Before I did, I decided to ask her sister, Victoria if it would be fine. I only did it because I didn’t want to ruin the friendship between Victoria and myself, especially since Victoria is our main stage manager in my drama department. So, I texted her and was told that Samantha was already in a relationship, which was disappointing to hear, but better to hear from her rather than embarrass myself later. Well, a few days later, we finish and record the show and we’re signing posters and Samantha and I sitting next to each other signing posters. When I got my poster back, I saw that Samantha had written a note to me that basically said something along the lines of “I enjoyed this show with you but I have something I want to tell you. Too bad you won’t know for three years.”

Basically, she left a note that said she had something to tell me and she won’t tell me until around the time I graduate. She also hasn’t told anyone else, so no one else knows about this, just her and I. It’s also very important because she’s written it down on paper so that she doesn’t forget.

That was the first time we ever properly talked and we hit it off quite well, started calling regularly. 8 hour calls at a time just talking. 3 weeks later he asked me to be his girlfriend and I said yes. So that's when we became ""official"" I guess. This is my first relationship ever, whereas he has had 2 previous relationships, so bear that in mind.

Because of the pandemic - we've met in person a handful of times - it was socially distanced outside. We video call every other day. We haven't kissed, most we've done is hugged. I'm fine with that honestly, because I don't have a lot of interest in being physical and consider myself somewhere on the asexual spectrum. Physical compatibility is very important in a relationship however, and I've told him where I stand. He seemed ok with it, but also said he can't help but get his hopes up for when we can finally meet up without social distancing. Seems like he's contradicting himself, but I didn't question it at the time.

Anyways, he's been talking about our upcoming anniversary. And he considers our anniversary to be 7th July, the day we first started talking. He's been talking about what  ideas for a gift he's going to get me and what we should plan for the day.  

To be honest, it feels strange using the term anniversary for our relationship. Even though we've known each other for nearly a year, we haven't been able to do any of the normal things that couples do. I sense he's built up an idealised version of our relationship in his head and imagined it to be something it isn't. We don't even know if we're physically compatible yet, and that's an area you can't really compromise without resentment building.

It has nothing to do with me and I understood. I told her if she needed to not talk for a while she could. I told her we could be friends because she is genuinely an awesome person.

This may be a hard truth but women do not want something casual with you. Most women will not hook up with some Joe Schmo as they’re not exciting like a hot guy would be. 

Women risk A LOT for causal sex including their health, lives, and pregnancy. So they go after guys that are really really sexually attractive, which unfortunately is not most of us. For the rest of us, a woman has to actually be in love with us to find us sexually attractive.

They aren’t going to risk it the danger for some pudgy guy she meets at the bar. Women are going to have casual sex with the top percentage of men. The rest of us are relationship material.

I just look at her profile pic and don't even bother replying to her messages"" and even worse things about others. He told me about how he was seeing a girl and trying to escalate things to sex with her but she just wouldn't budge so he grew tired and decided to end things. I know the girl btw. It's not her style to go out with a guy she barely knows and have sex with him in a car in a dirt road or go to a hotel with him. I just kept agreeing with him because I don't like to argue. In the end, I just said that the problem with the both of us is that ""we either have really bad luck or we're doing something wrong. But I prefer the 'bad luck' theory because it means it's not my fault"". He just laughed at the possibility.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nb3sdd/today_i_heard_a_coworkers_rant_about_women_and_i/
88,nb43kt,1620866446,Trouble with Older Women (19 M),"  
Man, these past couple of months have been a landslide. I had an opportunity with an awesome older woman that I met on Tinder out of pure luck and I ended up wasting it due to another unforeseen relationship which happened to kind of roll in out of nowhere. It was extremely hard to pick between the two (the other girl was my age which I had met at work), but I opted for choosing the other. That relationship ended mutually a couple weeks ago since I had to relocate for school and I'm now starting to begin to move on and looking at my options. I once again realized this dormant side of me which I pushed aside during the relationship with my coworker but I want to address the part of me which led me to choose her instead of the older woman. What questions should I be asking myself? Should I rule out my attraction to older women because of this? At the end of the day, I never saw my attraction to older women as a sexual fantasy and never wanted to proceed with it in case it was.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nb43kt/trouble_with_older_women_19_m/
89,nb48bj,1620866826,Help please,"Had first meet up with guy (24F) (26M) 
I might be a tad infatuated but I’m pretty sure we had a nice time! Chatted over some coffee but it was kind of late, but I enjoyed it. 
I’m goin out of town next week for about a week but would like to see him again before that, but just saw him a couple of days ago. 
I don’t want to seem to intense or i to him, and I already sort of initiated a convo yesterday, so I’ll let him reach out first? 
I don’t believe in games but I also don’t like when people burn my phone so I wouldn’t want to do that because I know he’s busy with work. 
kind of just asking for some moral support or guidance here lol",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nb48bj/help_please/

91,nb4jxj,1620867764,All Women are Gold Diggers—No Exceptions,"I went on a date with this girl that wouldn’t shut the hell up about being independent. Because of this, I told her to pay for dinner. Ironic how the “independent women” are no longer independent when it comes to paying for themselves. All women are annoying ass gold diggers.

She told me that I spent way more money than her, and that I should at least pay half (this was the gold digger’s response to me saying that I wasn’t paying). I told gold digger, “no,” but gold digger kept telling me to pay. 

Gold digger said, “You spent $100 on your meal, and I’m not even gonna bring up dessert.” She was right...the thing is that she clearly doesn’t understand biology. Men have to eat more since we’re not weak and frail like these gold diggers.

I almost called her a “female dog,” then I left. The next morning, the cops were at my door with a fine for “theft”. Naturally, I paid it, but I was pissed. 

I called her cursing her out and she blocked me. 

I’m planning on robbing her place this weekend. She really pissed me off.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nb4jxj/all_women_are_gold_diggersno_exceptions/

93,nb4w42,1620868763,Do I have to tell him I have an FWB?,"I have been seeing a guy for about a month and a half. He's great and everything I want in a relationship. Only problem is he's moving away soon (in less than a month). The topic of long distance has come up but we haven't really sat down and hashed out the details (we will do that soon). So far, we have explicitly made it clear that we are not in a relationship and are just casually seeing each other until we can make a decision on long distance. We do sleep together. The issue is I also have a fwb. We just recently started having sex (both the fwb and the guy i'm dating use protection). I am not sure if the guy I'm dating assumes exclusivity even though we have made it explicit that we are not in a relationship. Am I obligated to tell him I have an fwb until we discuss things and maybe make it official? Obviously, I won't keep the fwb if we do make it official. But until then, would this scenario be wrong?

The fwb is completely aware of the situation and knows I will not pursue a relationship with him.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nb4w42/do_i_have_to_tell_him_i_have_an_fwb/

Its clear she has a BF on her social media but she hasn't brought him up and has been treating me like we're going on a date. Again, I'm hoping its just her being excited to see an old friend but I feel like there is some attraction between us and thats a bit uncomfortable.
