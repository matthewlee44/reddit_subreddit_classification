0,nulbfb,1623094347,Online dating scares me...,"I hate online dating. Every time I talk about my dating struggles, it is ALWAYS the first thing to come up; ""Have you tried tinder?"" and no, I haven't. You know why?

Because it sucks. Having some mysterious algorithm control your dating life is not the way to go, at least if you're unattractive. If it works for you, or your dad or friend or the cousin of your friends sisters brother in law found a partner using OLD, that's great, good for you. But for every person online dating works for, there are many people it DOES NOT work for. They are a BUSINESS, if they paired everyone up, they would have no customer base, they have to make money. This of course, is done by the algorithm. They push the most desirable people up the ladder to be more noticed while the less lucky people are stuck at the bottom, until they are thrown the occasional match every now and then to keep them hooked and just *maybe* pay for tinder gold. This not only makes them waste their effort, but it harms their self esteem since online dating doesn't really represent the real world.

But like I said, there are people that it works for, and that's fine, good for you. But when I don't like is when people try to discount other people's struggles that didn't get so lucky. Like right now, there's a post on the front page here about someone that just got their first kiss at 21, through tinder (ofc). Someone then replied, calling it a ""roadblock"" where they then got downvoted and a bunch of people rebottled with some anecdote about how them or someone they knew found a partner using it, so it must be great!!!!!!!

These people should, politely, shut the fuck up. Just because you or someone you know used Tinder or some other clone of it and it worked for them doesn't mean it isn't a roadblock for other people. Especially, when time and time again it has been proven that online dating can do more harm than good.

That's why it scares me so much that it is now the most common way to meet people. When everyone is reduced to a picture and a short blurb, that's a huge problem. It's gotten to the point now where some people don't even WANT to meet people outside of dating apps, which is a big problem for me and other people where it doesn't work. This combined with the fact that usually women have more options to choose from at their fingertips which can warp expectations means bad things for my generation, and I fear for it. I fear for a time where online dating is the only realistic way to meet a partner, and where it isn't socially acceptable to start dating someone outside of one, and from what I've heard about from my peers and experienced myself I feel like we're almost there. It's bad news.

With that being said, **STOP FUCKING RECOMMENDING IT TO ME**. And don't even try to recommend anything that isn't Tinder, when I mean ""it"" I mean ALL OF ""it"", as in Bumble, Hinge, ""Plenty of Fish"", ""Coffee Meets Bagel"", Farmersonly.com, ALL OF IT. They are all basically the same deal with the same problems. If you want to give me advice on how to stop being a pathetic virgin, tell me some good ways of meeting people in person, or how to start a conversation, or what the hell ""flirting"" is. Don't tell me ""download an app and condense your entire being into a few pictures and a sentence with your height appended at the end because it's the only way you're gonna get noticed"". Thanks.

Edit: I'm also not saying online dating is not hard for women either, I know that most men on dating apps are crappy and just swipe on everyone. This post is about the whole spectrum of why it's shitty, I just talk about men struggles more since I have more experience with that and have heard about it more.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nulbfb/online_dating_scares_me/

3,nulzt6,1623096000,When work is your social life...?,"I (33M) work for an outdoors adventure group that takes people on zipline, off road buggy, tours and offers camping and many different kinds of tourism attractions for the area. Many days I meet groups from local state colleges or from out of town, but also locals and people that live somewhat close. I am put in a position of leadership and safety for many life threatening moments where extreme safety is involved. Basically we grow a quick bond and trust is developed at a rapid pace. 
My question is, is it okay to meet customers and/or date customers I meet through work. I am concerned they may not see me for the real me initially..for instance I have PTSD and have a background of trauma that has me learning new coping skills and living a very secluded life outside of work. That makes it very hard to meet people, so when I put my act on for work I often become very likeable...most of the time for tips, of course. However, I meet some beautiful women and learn about each other enough that I'd like to ask one out sometime. I just don't want to be that guy, so I never do. 
Any thoughts? Obviously we have a work policy against it, but it is very loose and not enforced. It may be the only people I meet for months and my job is also my social life.

8,numqh5,1623097826,This long-distance social media crush is getting painful — advice?,"Long story short, last year I (28F) traveled to another state to stay with my brother for several months and met a guy that I began to develop feelings for after hanging out together multiple times (as part of a larger friend group). A few days before it was time for me to return home, I asked him on a date. I didn’t want to leave with regret. From my perspective, the date was a great time. We spent the night together and got breakfast together the next day.

I honestly was not anticipating us to start a long-distance relationship or necessarily stay close after I left. I thought that date was enough for me to be happy for what I had with him and leave it at that.

I think the problem really began when he started following me on Instagram.

He likes my posts from time-to-time, watches all my stories, and occasionally slides into my dms to react to something I posted. All of this has been purely friendly. It’s never felt rude or creepy, and it’s never really been super flirtatious either. That is to say, there have been no interactions, from my perspective, that would indicate he is interested in having something more with me.

I guess these reminders of him have started to feel painful. I keep thinking about what a good time we had together and what a great guy I really think he is. I’ve started to feel that I wish there was a way we could be together. If not, maybe I should block him or have him unfriend me so I won’t be reminded of him and can move on?

A part of me wants to just confess all my feelings and leave it all on the table. But then would he think I am a weirdo who has no chill? Pining for him after all this time after just one date?

What do you guys think? Could he still be interested in me? Or do guys follow girls they had things with and it doesn’t mean anything?

I'm a critical overthinker who overanalyzes everything and gets paranoid.   
Nothing serious has happened yet, as me and this girl just started talking two weeks ago. 

we had class together this past semester and I saw her look at my IG story before she had followed me, and was like hmmm...interested.

a day later I messaged her privately on zoom and said we should keep in touch over the summer. She said she agrees and we exchanged info. We found out that we live like 30 seconds from each other. 

last week, we texted for a bit, but she stopped replying so I figured whatever maybe we're just going to be friends no big deal. 

she then adds me on discord this past friday night (we're on a mutual school server so she found me) and we talked until like 3 AM, she did mention sometimes she's horrible at texting and didn't want me to take it personally that she forgot to reply to me via text prior. I didn't bring this up, she did. So she's aware it's a thing for her...

we were discussing hanging out THIS WEEK, FRIDAY, and I came up with an idea to go to a museum and she was like ""yeah even if we don't go there we can just hang out and vibe."" Totally seemed interested and I was down too. She asked me if I wanted to drive up in her car, and my last text to her was suggesting that we get our tickets together and drive up to the museum, I asked if she wanted to get tickets now or later. She did not reply to that. 

She totally seemed down, especially since she suggests an alternate plan of just hanging out and vibing! Then she never replied. but I know she was out with friends all weekend and celebrating her best friend's birthday. I think she genuinely just forgot to reply again, or maybe she just didn't find the time, whatever. She DID snapchat me a video yesterday afternoon telling me she was out stuff, driving around. So I wasn't ghosted, but just not replied to via text

&amp;#x200B;

I know she's home now but I do not want to text her and seem like needy or desperate. I do need to talk to her and ask about our plans for Friday (because we kind of need to figure that out soon anyway, we need tickets, and if I were to buy them I need her student ID number so we can get two discounts). When is it appropriate to text her again and say ""Yo, do we still want to do this?"" or ""Did you already buy your ticket?"" or ""are we still on?"" I can tell she's a busy person.

When he finally gave me context, he told me that he had unprotected sex with another girl a couple weeks before he had sex with me, and that she informed him that morning that she was positive for chlamydia and that he should go get tested, so he did.

My issue with this whole situation is that he knew he potentially had an STD, went and got tested, and still did not inform me. I do not know if he would have told me if he had an STD if I had not hit him up that night. Him and I have also been friends for 5 years and even briefly dated, so it was not like it was a random one night stand where he will never see me again and could not have told me. Obviously I reacted badly, him and I texted for about 20 minutes arguing over it and we have not talked since that night and have since removed each other on all social media.

I went and got STD tested (negative thankfully) but, he never texted me telling me his results, so I had to get tested for all STDs.

25,nuogm5,1623102196,Venting - women in the western world have a much easier life compared to men,"&amp;#x200B;

I hate it when someone says this and people start talking about women getting raped, abusive men and so on, which isn't a valid argument anyway because most victims of violence are men.

 my argument is simple: A is an average guy ( average looks, average salary, average social skills, charisma etc. ) and B is an average girl ( average looks, average salary, average social skills, charisma etc. )

if nothing wrong happens in their life ( none of them is a victim of rape or violence of any kind etc. ) and they both lead a normal life with no major or traumatic event, who's going to have it easier? The woman.

First scenario, you are a man: men are taught to respect women and treat them like princesses, men go to war, men usually do the manual and dangerous jobs, men have to approach women, court them etc, men have to be the provider, men have to be emotionally strong because they have to be successful, because women seek strong men etc.

second scenario, you are a woman who isn't going to face any traumatic event during your life ( abuse, rape ): you can cry, you can seek comfort, you can wait for men to make the first move and make you feel desired because that's what a man has to do. Is he even a man if he doesn't make you feel desired? Is he even straight if he doesn't chase women?Nobody expects you to be successful because women aren't meant to be the providers, they can aim for success but that's just something that pleases them, not something necessary. You aren't going to do the manual jobs because you don't have the strength. You only need to be born decent looking and that's it. I'm not saying women are dumb, they can be teachers, they can be entrepeneurs, they can do anything, but they simply aren't expected to be leaders, providers, emotionally strong and so on. It's their choice.

What does this have to do with dating? Simple. A CEO making 800k per year is going to be more appealing than a bricklayer, it's all about the pressure men have to be successful, to be the providers, to do this and that. 

\---

Oh, I realise I'm going to sound overconfident, but I'm an attractive male - I look very very similar to Ian Somerhalder lol - and I also have a very high income even though I'm only 34. I don't face the struggles most men face, so I'm not being bitter about anything. I'm not bragging about this, but nothing that I said applies to me, but I'm not the average man in any way. Again, I'm only saying this because I don't want anyone tell me '' maybe you need to do better in life '' when I already have a high income  and even my 25 year old teacher was sexually attracted to me when I was 18. I don't even approach women because I don't have to and I have also rejected quite a few times, but again, I'm not your average man at all.

But if reincarnation is a thing, I want to be a woman in my next life. Not being born in the western world is a problem for both genders, being a poor man or an oppressed woman isn't going to make much of a difference, but if I have to be reincarnated in the western world, I'll choose being a woman without even thinking twice, because chances that I'll be born rich/good-looking/both rich and good-looking again are close to nil and I'd have to struggle like every man.

I am attractive, my photos may not do me complete justice but they are not bad at all, I just prefer to underpromise and overdeliver than the opposite, unlike most people I guess judging by most of my dates.

I find that in the first day or so when I have the initial boost I match with people of all races. But after that here is what has been happening:

With black guys, I am so far 100% guaranteed to get a match within 24 hours. And I am talking really hot guys. Same success rate with Asian guys. Latino guys, I seem to be 95% likely to get a match within say 48 hours. White guys... I matched with some on the first day but the next couple of days not one.

Granted, up til now I have been in the habit of deleting my Tinder account within less than a week so it is unclear to me if the matches will happen weeks down the track. I'm considering keeping my Bumble account for longer just to see if that's the case.

What's happening here? Just to be clear, I have dated guys from many different races and generally in the past have not dated many white guys, but I don't discriminate against them. Also I'm white myself, just so you know it's not like I'm being discriminated against for being of colour.

I would think maybe white guys just don't find me attractive but then I remembered that in the initial boost I do get matches with white guys so it seems I'm just being shown to the other races much more quickly. But why is that? Because they have lower scores? The apps divide people by race and show potential matches accordingly? Are the apps racist or does that mean the people using them have created the low scores for these men?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nup3xp/dating_apps_and_race/

38,nupu2r,1623105897,Dating apps have destroyed EVERYONE'S chances at finding love.,"I just got out of a 6 month relationship that was unhealthy for me a little while ago, and I am getting back into the dating scene. To preface this I have always had trouble with dating, but never this much.

I have been trying to find a long term partner for years now, and every time I get back into the apps, the websites, etc, it gets harder and harder to find someone looking for something serious. Almost every profile I see is labeled for ""hookups."" No one is looking for a real connection anymore. However, I say this, with my limited range and knowledge, I have no idea if it would be the same anywhere else, but I can say that other apps, such as Soul, or Omegle, I have met wonderful people, and even had a few girls jokingly ask me ""when's the wedding?"" in regards to how charming I am, but it never goes anywhere (or I dont allow it to) because of the distance bc these apps don't filter by location. However on dating apps, I rarely ever receive ""likes"" and even fewer than that I get ""matches."" When I do match with people they put NO energy into the conversation at all, one word replies, or more than likely trying to sell their OnlyFans to me, which I have no interest in.

My question is WHY, why have we as a society, put ourselves into this situation where NO ONE can connect anymore? Connections, simply speaking to people, is being sold as a commodity in apps like EPals, and phrendly which literally sells the worst part of dating (imo) the mindless flirting that leads to no dates or meetups. The ""premium"" option on these apps have been split into several different commodities, selling the CHANCE of a human connection like it's SOME PRODUCT.

If I can get along with people, find chances of love, just fine without the pretext of dating, without the choice overload, without the sea of faces, with the feeling of lust out of the way, WHY, are we as human beings subjecting ourselves to the capitalization of our emotions, our sadness, our loneliness, our NEED for love. 

How am I supposed to find someone locally, someone I can actually touch and feel and love, if the tools provided are there to capitalize on our suffering, not help? I can't go out and meet people irl bc of corona (not like I'm going to find a long term relationship in a bar anyway), I can't find locals online, I can't do anything but try a long distance relationship again bc that's the only way to meet anyone with any want of doing something more than a hookup, or even give someone with charm and personality a chance.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nupu2r/dating_apps_have_destroyed_everyones_chances_at/

Fast forward to now, I find it difficult to be in a romantic relationship because it seems like I’m so far behind everybody else and it’s really upsetting.

&amp;#x200B;

Day 1: we match (first in a long time! yay!). Conversation happens, we share interests, looking good

Day 2: more of the same, exchange numbers

Day 3: stuff comes up on her end so conversation stops for a bit. She'll tell me when it's over. Was not a fake excuse, I know what the stuff was and it was absolutely real

Day 10: she reaches out, conversation continues, she seems eager to meet, we arrange something for the next day

Day 11: nothing. After waiting a while, I sent a polite message to see what's happening

Day 12: nothing. Apparently I've been ghosted

Day 13: definitely ghosted

Day whatever: you get the idea

&amp;#x200B;

And now I'm here. What could possibly have happened between ""see you tomorrow"" and her disappearing. I often try to find ways to blame myself but I really just can't think of anything I did at all wrong.

But here lies the problem... the extended time at the bar caught up to me and I was pretty canned (we also smoke some weed which put me in another stratosphere).

From what I recall I was being very dumb and annoying (drunk) ... she let me crash at her place and because of how things went, I left quickly in the morning leaving my watch and a few belongings.

I send her an initial text the next day and get ghosted for 3 days - I text her again and she says she does not have my watch or any of my items. At this point I chalked everything up to an L.

Another 4 days go by and she says that she ""found"" my watch. I know I didn't put it anywhere crazy and this is where I'm overthinking... why didn't she say she had it initially?

Anyways, I go to pick up the stuff, we exchange hello's and she rushes off because she was going to work... I had an apology lined up but it didn't seem like a great move and I froze.

I’m awful with women and I’m pretty Terrified of being around women I find attractive. And not like I get nervous when talking to them. 

To give a small example of something I’ve done a few times; there’s this girl that goes to the gym with me around the same time I usually go and she is stunning. I would love to be able to talk to her but for many reasons I can’t even if I could I know I shouldn’t. One time I made eyes contact her about 10 minutes after I arrived and and I immediately left.

I was not staring at her. I was looking forward and she walked by in front of me, she caught my eye and I looked up and she looked over and saw that I was looking at her. It was too embarrassing and I had to leave. The thought that she maybe thinks I was staring at her or that I think she’s attractive makes me sick to my stomach.

I feel this was about any attractive girl I see. Just a combination of embarrassment for thinking she’s cute, then a feeling of hopelessness because I’ll never be able to be with a girl like her, partially because I know I’m too afraid to talk to them, and partially because I know that even if I wasn’t that I’m too ugly for them and these girls are so far out of my league that I wouldn’t have a chance.

46,nuqtoz,1623108808,Am not sure if things are going well in my relationship. I been feeling pessimistic .,"My bf (21) and I (22) been dating for 1 year 5 months now &amp; living together. To point out first the things that are positive  . We have respect and love present in the relationship which is a huge plus for me. We get along well, although he is still bit emotionally immature but I know how to be the bigger person and how to manage him when he gets his tantrums and our discussions end up pretty quick. We have trust, we have never lied or hide anything from each other we knows each other deepest secrets ext. We share location, phones, he is myy phone screen am in his, profiles pictures together, each other phone password . We have plans together we care for each other. So just to conclude ; all this things that make the couple solid are there. BUT.... 

Romantically speaking we have changed too much too soon in my opinion. Not long ago he used to get me flowers, right me poems, songs, send me romantics messages at least 1 a week letting me know how important  i am for him, or how lucky he feels am in his life, how his life has change to better so much since am with him. We been through so much individually but been there for each other and supposly those things make the relationship stronger. In just 1 year I have helped him become the best version of him, financially speaking, socially speaking, at work, at school, much better relationship with his family, much more organized life .  Helped him quit all his bad habits that he for so long tried to quit and he finally did it. We have cried and celebrate so much in such a short period of time. Plus the fact that we live together has made our relationship feel like a marriage not just bf &amp; gf.  

However I been analyzing how things have changed in terms of passion and romance. He used to always be on top of me kissing me hugging me. Always telling me sweet things , looking at me with so much attraction. Used to want sex everyday. And now there is nearly none of that left. The last time he bought me flowers was months ago. He would also used to see all my favorite series with me even if he wouldn’t like them. And i can put other few examples but i think i got my point across. 

Comparing before and now makes me really sad but also insecure . He also used to reassure me all the time when i felt insecure about any other female at work or a friend . He would say things like “ dont doubt me I would never cheat on you , your the only woman i want for the rest of my life” and i could tell he meant it it came from his heart. But now although my insecurities have gotten better and I have been working on my self , i still have those days where i feel insecure( nothing outstanding ) , girls know what am talking about. However he doesn’t confort me like before and reassures me in a romantic way , more so like annoyed of me asking the same thing over and over. 

I already spoke to him about it and he was a bit inmature about it. I think He lacks emotional intelligence to empathize and feel my pain.  His respond was cold and concrete . “ we been together for a long time, we live together ,sleep together, the romantic phase is over thats it, nothing is going on”. I did told him if he could please try to be a bit like before romantic and although he has agreed he just does it for a few days and then forgets. Beside me telling him to be a certain way is forcing a behavior that he is not really feeling.

I have been told by friend and family that my mistake was been so suffocating at the beginning of the relationship and making everything so easy for him &amp; put my world to evolve around him&amp; that now he gives me for granted. I never agreed with them because since he was giving me the same love and attention back and passion and romance everything was reciprocated back to me then everything was fine i was giving the same I was getting. But i think the outcome of that mistake is showing now. Although he does show he loves me I think. Its too soon for him to be treating me like if we have been together for years . I think we should still be in the romantic stage. Or at least that what I would like. 

TL;DR. My boyfriend is not romantic anymore and although Ik it is normal for this phase to end i think is too soon in a relationship of 1 year and 5 months-. If we are already at this point we are going to treat each other as siblings in a couple years. Please give me some tips so I can get him to be like before.

-she mainly talks to family and not really to her friends (peaked over her shoulder once and saw old messages months or years old but texts her mom, dad, family friends at least monthly/weekly)
- she mainly goes out with family or family friends, not with just friends
- she  panics when driving
- she has no pics of exes and counts kindergarten and elementary school relationships as actual relationships
- she is hesitant in sending pics of herself or her art and if she does send a selfie it's a low resolution one. 
- she almost cries if people don't acknowledge her compliments and thank her
- she was initiating conversations but after our 1st  date when I couldn't talk there and then via text she started to become distant and hasn't initiated the conversation since.
- she admits that friends don't wish to actually hang out with her and was surprised when I asked her out again.
- she expressed interest in a 2nd date but started to become more distant when I asked if she could pay since I paid the 1st time.
- she hardly posts on most of her social media (FB, tiktok, Insta) and she's not on any dating app.
-the one social media account she's most active on posting is Pinterest where she's dying to be in a relationship.
-on Pinterest she post motivational pins about self motivation, self healing, self love, and things to remind herself that she's beautiful and fine the way she is.
- She has different husbandos (male waifus) and even listens to ASMR role plays of them (makes me wonder if she actually ever dated).
- I once offered to get to know her and her issues since now she basically says she's dealing with a lot of family and personal issues as reasons why she hasn't been able to establish the 2nd date and was very happy that I care about her.
- I retracted this offer when I tried setting up a phone date and she couldn't talk during a Sunday and didn't give an actual date and time that I can call.
- she ended up sharing a pin on Pinterest wanting to find a guy who genuinely cares about her personal problems and not pretend to.

Canceled, rescheduled or let them know I was gonna be late... yes, but ghosting is downright mean. I'm not a bad looking person or rude or clingy but it still happens.
I think online dating has made us forget how to interact with people. The common courtesies that once were are no longer. It makes me want to give up. I don't want to have to get ready for another date and text him to see if he's on his way only to be answered with silence. 
Online you have no real connection with that person so it's easy to ghost,  where as if you met in a bar and hit it off there's already chemistry so you actually feel bad ghosting. Maybe that's the problem,  no one talks to each other outside of the internet anymore.

I have always put my focus on school and dating just didn’t seem interesting to me at the time. I’m also socially awkward and average looking so guys have never pursued me like they did with my friends. Recently, I starting thinking more about it because I felt like I’m getting to an age where it’s unusual to see someone who has never dated and I like the thought of having someone to share my life with. I started using tinder and so far I’ve met up with 4 guys. The dates were fun but I didn’t find myself wanting to see them again and it felt more like a chore than something to look forward to. I started talking to this other guy about a month and a half ago and we have now gone to dinner 4 times. We have been talking everyday since and he is the only guy that I have been able to do this with without feeling like it is a chore. We have many things in common which is rare for me to find in someone else. The thing is I feel like he’s starting to like me as more than friends and I still don’t feel that way for him. I do get excited about seeing him but I don’t feel the “butterflies” that people say they feel when they like someone. When I saw him for the first time I was not at all attracted to him although now I can consider him a little bit attractive.

And three weeks later, last Saturday night, he texted me hey do you wanna meet up again, I know this is screaming fwb. I said I wanna call him I missed his voice he said this is his bedtime and next time he called me but I was not available then he is distantly responding to my texts since then. 

He has been out of a eight year relationship and he also mentioned he has been seeing someone casually. So he might be furthest guy to be exclusive but I AM SO ATTRACTED TO HIM.

Talked about how we would eventually get married, after we both lived our lives separately from one another.  He talked about how he knew he was going to marry me the moment we saw each-other.  We broke up, and haven’t spoken in 2 years. I saw him at a party 2 years ago, and he was acting very weird and uninterested.  I have no clue what he thinks of me. He’s (21/m) and I’m (21/f). I’m debaging if I should message him to get a coffee or something ? But I’m worried he doesn’t even think about me and would think I’m crazy.

We talked about the possibility of us dating. Even though she has a boyfriend. 
I told her we wouldn’t last long but the sex would be amazing. 
She thought I was sweet and said how I’m a good guy.

59,nurtjj,1623111914,Went on my first date ever and it was very disappointing,"Hi everyone. I (16F) went on my first date tonight, with a guy (17) who works with me at a restaurant every weekend. We have been working together for a few months, he was dating when we first met but broke up some weeks ago and asked me out last week. We went to the movies together and everything was fine until he started making moves, you know, holding my hand, putting his arm around me etc. 
It was IMMEDIATELY weird. Not because of him, since he's very nice and good looking, but because it simply... didn't work. There was no chemestry. We kept talking through out the movie, making jokes and all that, until we kissed. Basically we stayed that way for the rest of the film and I didn't back up but didn't initiate anything either. After that we talked for a bit, I called an uber and left.
I was hoping that putting myself out there would help my dating experience, but it did the exact opposite lol. He sent me a text later saying that he enjoyed going out with me and I said I did too because I didn''t want to make him sad. But I also really don't want to give him false hope. It really had nothing to do with him, like I said before, he's an amazing guy, but we simply didn't work well together, at least not to me. 
On top of that, I've been doubting my sexuality a lot lately because I've been with women and it somehow felt better than being with men (??) but I've also liked some dudes in the past so I'm not gay either. Idk lol.
Now I'm asking myself a few questions. Did he actually like it?? I hope not. And how will I manage to not make it weird at work with him? And if I have to reject him, how?? I'm very bad at saying no to people.
Anyway, that's about it. Sorry for the long rant lol. I just hope the right person comes around soon..",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nurtjj/went_on_my_first_date_ever_and_it_was_very/

68,nut5l0,1623116116,Am I (m25) wasting my time with gf (f23),"I feel defeated at times, I guess I’m my own victim to the whole opposites attract thing.

My gf and I have been seeing each other on and off for about 3 years and are about 10 months in of official “dating” we’ve both mer eachothers friends and families and I’m absolutely sure that she loves me and this relationship.

My problem stems from our differences that I can’t get over, we’re planning on moving in together in a few months and as we get closer to the time of locking in an apartment I’m (obviously) having second thoughts..

Her level of cleanliness is far off from mine, not cleaning cat liter on the floor in the bathroom, leaving dishes and fast food bags in her room for sometimes days, sleeping in clothes she’s worn all day. She has a white cat who has a cleaning issue, you can literally see dry poop stuck to her but and her coat is yellow at the top, she probably gets one bath a year and she always says she’ll take her to a groomer but i’m looking at that poor little fur of mess right now (lol)

I’m a pretty fit guy, i try to motivate her to get active not the gym or anything hardcore just getting out and taking a walk every so often. I know she doesn’t like the weight she’s at but she rather stay in bed literally all day and watch netflix and tik toks 🙄.. I feel like whenever I bring up her lack of physical activity she leans hard on her “mental health” but never really tries or shows any motivation to get ANYTHING done. 

She works from home but her room is constantly messy, It’s annoying having to repeat myself over and over because i’m honestly not even a clean freak or anything I just can’t see myself coming home to that and not getting annoyed or angry.

We’ve talked about thesw things and I’ve been holding patient, hoping that she can get over whatever funk she claims to be in. I feel like the lack of effort sucks because she’s super happy with me but is it fair that I’m.. Not as happy? I mean here I am posting this long ass advice question.

I know the time is ticking and a decision needs to be made on my part but I also think maybe i’m being too hasty? We both have jobs that we can live comfortably off of. I don’t want to break her heart for sure, but Idk if thinking about my own happiness at this point is selfish or not. 

I’d jusy like some advice from anyone that’s been where I am. I don’t want to go down a hopeless path holding on to false hope.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nut5l0/am_i_m25_wasting_my_time_with_gf_f23/

71,nuti5w,1623117260,There is no getting good at dating only getting good at finding compatible people,"I just had a date last night to where the girl kept sending me pictures of herself on snap

After the first date I can tell it probably won't go anywhere

I knew her from work and she's not evil or abusive but she's already given me her origin story about her abusive guy she can't leave and who's had kids by and it just gets old

Hearing her story she just reminds me of my abusive ex and I can't do it but it has taught me that I'm actually not bad at women

I've had three steady girlfriends and two things that went nowhere but I've had at least eight first dates in the past 3 years

I regularly get complimented but I can thank mom and dad for those jeans my personality is the exact opposite of what I may portray with my image

But something could look good on the outside and do nothing for you emotionally and that counts for men too

I've dated some super attractive women in the past and I have had crushes on super attractive women but after I get to know them or meet them or hear how they view men sometimes my physical attraction dies out

If anybody takes anything positive from this is that stop worrying about getting somebody or trying to get many people

You can sleep with a bunch of people or have a bunch of people fantasizing like you but it won't mean much if you can't be around each other without fighting or feeling like you have to be guarded

I spent a lot of my youth being abused by adults and heavy bullying by other people and I barely got out of it with a clean enough psyche

After going with an abusive woman I try my best too avoid women with the same traits and even saying that, it does not mean that just because a woman may share a trait with an abuser doesn't mean she is but the human mind sometimes isn't rational when it comes to protecting your emotions


There was one girl I felt super compatible with but I wasn't able to get her number and I only met her at school years ago but whenever I think of a woman who was right for me she's the first to pop into my mind


So this is a PSA to both men and women

""Not being over my ex"" has been a major theme lately which has me feeling really used up and like men see me as an adventuresome thrill, but not relationship material.

For my entire dating life I've always been ""the other guy"" who girls in relationships become very intimate with. I think it made me feel like I knew better than other guys when their girlfriends would come to me for flirting or intimacy, but it (shockingly) was never healthy and always left me really hurt when things went too far and I inevitably fell for the girl. In the end, the best I could ever do (even when my connection with the girl was really strong) was clean up some other guy's mess and help the girl come to terms with committing to him. 

But this last week I did something I never (ever ever ever) do- I asked a (single) girl out on a date. Not a long series of intimate conversations before the girl goes to dinner with her boyfriend, not deep eye contact during work, not bated-breath-conversations about what turns us on followed by us going our separate ways- just a simple ""I'm interested in you"" invitation to a lunch date with a single girl who seemed interested. And you know what? It didn't go that well. She got kind of flakey and backed off, and I gave her some space. Now she seems kind of irritated, and it might not work out- but I'm so ok with it.

At first, it was going well and we were talking normally, as time progressed she complained about it being too hot, she started asking me to raise my voice but I didn't so she asked me to do this over 10 times. I don't like to raise my voice at all unless it's for a joke or I'm mad but after the 10th or so the time of her asking I started raising my voice. As her riding went on she started getting mad, even after her riding she was really upset. I had no idea what to do and honestly, I just stood next to her while she was cleaning up her horse. I would say something and she would only respond in a couple of words or she wouldn't respond at all. It went on like this for 30 minutes before I asked her what was up. She was mad how I wouldn't raise my voice, how I stood there and didn't ask her what was up for 30 minutes, how it was how, and how she was hungry. 
She was mad at me for another hour in a half till I left to go home, I tried to cheer her up to no avail. and I still for a decent amount of that time stood there not knowing what to say because she wouldn't have a conversation back with me and wouldn't talk to me about everything even after I apologized for something even though I don't think I did anything wrong

I honestly don't think I did anything wrong and the only thing that could be bad was how I waited to ask what was up. I haven't texted her all night and she hasn't texted me, should I say something but I don't think she'll want to have a convo and I really don't think I did anything wrong.

Because of some of her behaviors and my disapproval of it, I keep asking myself if I’m selling or just accepting a flawed individual. I’d really like some outside input on our situation.

So after trying to get girls to like me some I was 16 and nothing but failure, I asked this girl and she was the first girl to let me take her on a date. She quickly became my first kiss and soon After took my virginity. We have a few similar interest and I think we’re compatible. The only issue is I don’t like the way she treats me and other people sometimes. 

She has a very short temper and is very verbally aggressive and passive aggressive towards me when she’s frustrated. She yells and insults me sometimes, which I really dislike. The thing is, as I said, it took 6 years of effort trying to get a single date. I don’t think I wasn’t to wait until I’m 28 to find someone.

95,nuvyfc,1623125306,Have been hooking up with this guy I once casually dated on-and-off for four years. Realized I still have feelings for him. Do I just tell him at this point?,"I am going to try and make this as short as possible. 

So said guy and I met 4 years ago. We casually dated for a few months and he then ended things. We were both in really odd places in our lives, me being only 18 and just starting college (thus unfortunately developing borderline alcoholism and an  addiction to adderall) and him having things of his own to sort out. In retrospect, I think he was definitely in love with me. He said so when he was drunk one time and then another (both during the 6 months we dated) said I love you-he was on cocaine when he said it and I didn’t understand the drug at the time, so I just dismissed him, figuring he was not thinking clearly. *note* he doesn’t do a bunch of drugs, it was a one time thing for him. 

So after we “broke up” or whatnot, we hooked up on and off for about another year or so. We both then got into several  other relationships and did not see each other for two years. 9 months ago we hooked up again but it ended up being a one-night stand, which I now believe was mostly due to me being cold in result of just coming out of another fallout with an ex of mine.  He had tried to cuddle with me and I just kinda turned over, along with wanting me to stay for breakfast in the morning and me just leaving at 7am. When I told him after that night that I wasn’t looking for anything, he was kinda upset and said, “yeah, you made that very clear”.

So now, 9 months later, I recently replied to one of his Snapchat stories because I genuinely wanted to know more about what he posted. He ended up telling me that he would like to sleep with me again, which I agreed to. 

Alas, brings us to last night-we hooked up again and had a great time (or so I think he did, kinda what I’m trying to future out). Every time I see him, I find it so easy to just be open with him. It’s always like nothing had ever changed. Most of the time we watched TV together and ate popcorn. 

After last night, I had a huge epiphany. I realized that not only do I still have feelings for him, but I don’t think they ever left. I feel like he has always been that one person that continues to linger in the background, yet we always find our way back to each other. 

Question #1: 

Does he still have feelings for me too? Here are some examples of things that were said/done by him last night that make me think there might be a possibility: 

-he was more affectionate with me than required for just a hookup-we held hands a bit, we cuddled, and he came up behind me and wrapped his arms around my waist in a way that almost felt romantic. 

-he asked me personal questions about my life and opened up about some rather difficult things in his own. We definitely got into some touchy subjects, yet when he was on the receiving end he did not seem bothered or taken back at all and listened intently. He seemed like he actually cared. 

-we both said before that I wouldn’t stay over because we don’t sleep well together-so when I was leaving he asked me if I needed anything to help me stay awake and told me to please drive home safe (in a way that seemed more than just respectful) 

-somehow we ended up talking about our futures including kids and such, and when we both said that we would like to have our kids home schooled, he kind of had this endearing look in his eyes. 

-THE SEX. It didn’t really seem like pure hookup sex. It definitely seemed a bit more intimate than that. A lot of kissing, a lot of closeness. 

-he took the time to show me a clip from a movie that he thought was funny that he thought I would enjoy as well. 

-he asked me what I had going on tomorrow (as in today now) Still not sure why but he did. 

-this is the thing that really made me consider him still having feelings for me as well-when I was leaving, it was almost like he hesitated, which he also did 9 months ago. He just looked at me in a way I can’t adequately describe. We both have Aspergers so I think it can be difficult for both of us to read these sort of things sometimes, but in my mind, it definitely seemed like it was a rather endearing look. 

-before I left, I mentioned how insane it was that we met 4 years ago-and he responded, “I know, and we’ve both grown so much since then”. He said it in a way that, I’m not quite sure, almost seemed like he was longing for something? I’m not sure but to me it seemed like their was something behind that. 

Question #2: what do I do? 

I am 100% sure I still have feelings for him. Furthermore, I feel that with how much each of us have grown whilst apart, we would have the potential to be a great, healthy couple for many reasons-which I will not list since this has already been long enough, lol. 

I personally think I should just tell him, after doing this on and off thing for FOUR years. I mean, what are we going to do, keep booking up after every failed relationship we have until one of us is married?! 

I want to play it cool and I see how that might be the better approach but I also feel like it has been so long that I just kinda need to cut to the chase. I think part of the issue we had when we first met was that either of us communicated our feelings, and it left us both heartbroken. For example, if he would have shown more interest at that time, I would have had reason to believe he was serious when he told me he loved me. 

My alternative to just flat-out telling him is to ask him if he wants to come to a show with me sometime (which we already talked about prior to the hookup and he said he’d be up for it). But I also don’t want all of this confusion lingering around, because even if he DOES have feelings for me, he may still think I just want to hook up due to how cold I was when we hooked up 9 months ago. 

TL;DR: Someone I once casually dated that I have been hooking up with on and off for years now is back in my life again and I still have feelings for him and I think he does too. Do I just cut to the chase and tell him since it has been so long, or do I just ask him to go out sometime?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nuvyfc/have_been_hooking_up_with_this_guy_i_once/
96,nuw3xu,1623125863,Do I have feelings for her? And what should I do moving forward?,"So I'm (19M) currently living in a college hall, and I met a girl (19F) who lives on my floor about five months ago. Very soft spoken and pretty, rather similar to me personality wise. In fact, we share many interests, such as the music we enjoy listening to, or the tv shows we watch. One of my favorite moments with her so far was a time when the two of us, wasted from a night of partying, sang along to our favorite songs, with our arms around each other while walking to the clubs.

Being around her and talking to her often makes me happier in general, even a day of stressfulness or boredom can turn a full 180 on my mood when I talk with her, never failing to make my day brighter. Occasionally when she gets too close to me physically, my heart skips a beat. I've even had a dream one night, involving the two of us cuddling on the couch.

On the other hand, she has shown some possible signs of interest towards me, such as touching my arm or shoulder when I make her laugh or when others in our friend group tease me, and most times when I say something during conversations within our friend group, she tends to listen (though this may be because I tend to be rather shy, so the moments that I do talk are less frequent compared to many others in our friend group). She's also complemented me a few times, saying she likes my hair and my clothing, even going as far as saying I'm like a model.

However, the most notable signs that she may have feelings I've noticed so far are:

- during a game of tag in my hall, one rule stated that linking arms with another player makes you immune to being tagged. In two instances she has linked both her arms around mine, when linking just one arm is enough, and I had not seen her initiate arm linking with any of our other friends.

- during a lab session where she was my partner, she had to hold onto my arm in order to attach something. She held my arm for a noticably longer time than necessary, long enough for me get slightly nervous. I thought this may be because I work out rather often, and also play golf every weekend, so my forearms have rather defined muscles that have garnered many compliments from my friends. 

- In another instance, she got to see my entire bare upper body's muscle definition when our friend group went on a trip to the beach, and later on she seemed visibly happy when I asked her for a shoulder massage after a workout session, to which a few of our friends teased her that she must've been waiting for me to ask for a massage (I could not see her reaction to these comments, as I was not facing her at the time)

- a couple days ago, she showed me photos of her workout progress over five months, asking for my opinion. She was initially hesitant to show me the photos, as she is showing a lot of skin.

Advice I'd like:

- I talked with my parents regarding my feelings towards this girl a couple weeks ago, to which they were hesitant at the idea of me dating her, mainly due to the fact we are of different ethnicities (me being Chinese, she being a European-Indian), mostly concerns regarding cultural differences, our families possibly having struggles getting along, and even further down the line, regarding marriage and having our own family. Though I managed to alleviate some concerns by reassuring my parents that this girl has many friends of Chinese and other asian backgrounds, hence her parents are likely very open-minded. Overall, my parents allowed me to make my own decision, but to make sure I don't suffer in the long term.
(Should I make the leap of faith?) 

- I have only talked to one other friend regarding my feelings, and she has assured me that she will continue to update me if she notices any signs that my feelings may be reciprocated. 
(Should I ask any other trusted friends for advice?)


I would appreciate any words of advice regarding mine or her feelings, as well as any advice on any actions I should take moving forward, in the comments.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nuw3xu/do_i_have_feelings_for_her_and_what_should_i_do/
97,nuw6fl,1623126112,Too many male-dominated interests?,"Hey all,

so I'm a straight college guy (rising junior) who has never dated before because of trust issues but have made a lot of progress recently and think I'll finally be ready to give this dating thing a try once we get back on campus in the fall.

To prepare, I've read Mate and thought it was excellent. One thing that really stuck out to me was the idea of a mating market and how one should prioritize schools/cities/social environments with a balanced (or female skewed) gender ratio and accordingly that's made me examine what circles I'll be running in and I've come to realize that a lot of my interests will lead to spend most of my time around other dudes. Obviously, I'm not going to change all my interests just for girls cause that's pretty lame but I am thinking of maybe swapping out one or two of my interests for something with a better gender ratio. Here are some of my main interests:

\-I'm double majoring in Math and CS, both of which are male leaning at my school though Math is better with a 40% female students while CS is something like 25% female

\-I will be participating in the competitive programming club which is roughly 30% female

\-I will also be running a kind of nerdy social movement (Effective Altruism) club and I anticipate it'll be something like 35% female based on past event attendance

\-I will go to the gym a few times a week for an hour but I guess that's not REALLY a social environment haha...

But anyways, I feel like in these kinds of environments, even though I really get along with the kind of girls there, I will have a fair bit of competition due to the gender imbalance and since I'm below average in looks, only average in height and have decent but not excellent social skills, I doubt things would be too rosy for me.

Some other things that I genuinely am interested in include French (French club seems 70%+ female to me) and maybe cooking (I would imagine a similar ratio for cooking classes on campus?) and while I wouldn't vibe with these kinds of girls AS well as my fellow nerds, I definitely wouldn't mind dating some of them and it would be a lot more plausible for me too!

Any insights, especially from people in similar situations would be appreciated!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nuw6fl/too_many_maledominated_interests/
98,nuwc98,1623126699,how could my perception of the ‘situation’ differ so drastically from theirs?,"Since my last relationship ended in 2018, I haven’t even been close to entering into another legitimate relationship. Every four to six months, the same cycle has repeated itself: I meet someone, we get to know each other; over time they are consistent in their actions, except no escalation occurs; one way or another the ‘talk’ gets brought up, the idea of a relationship with me seems like a joke to them; I feel embarrassed for even THINKING that was a possibility, and then I wonder if I’m delusional or something.

I just don’t understand how they all were on such a different wave length than me. Of course they all had excuses, the most popular: I’m too busy for a relationship, like yeah we ALL have stuff on our plate!! Obviously, that line was a lame excuse to spare my feelings. After all, defining a relationship by formally acknowledging it as such, takes zero time or additional effort. Nothing would change, I wasn’t expecting them to ask for my hand in marriage overnight nor was I desperate to start a family and get uber serious. I JUST wanted them to publicly acknowledge me as their current partner, but apparently that was a ludicrous idea. 

I’m NOT an embarrassment or a dirty little secret. They pursued me, they set the tone and I merely reciprocated by matching their energy. How the hell could my perception of the ‘situation’ be SO drastically different from from theirs?!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nuwc98/how_could_my_perception_of_the_situation_differ/
