1,qndt3k,1636126796,This Girl Like Me?," 

Hi Everyone, Im John,im 16 Years and I moved to London like 1 Month ago, im new in this school im in,and Look i I met a girl named Ashley( blonde, blue eyes), after School, She have 16 too,like two/three Weeks Ago,i met her in break , Then after 1 week ,She ask me if i could stay with her in Break,But i couldnt because I had to go home in that Break,Soo after two weeks,I was invited by Ashley to go out ,I said ""Ok""and Then after in That Afternoon ,I met Ashley and a Friend(Named Olivia) in Waitrose &amp; Partners Supermarket.

Then after We enter There because I was hungry so i was about to buy some food.

Then Olivia said ""John is going to buy The Milka Heart Chocolate""but i didnt Said Anything and then she was happy but The Supermarket didnt have That Chocolate because was Sold Out. But She kissed me on the cheek.

I bought Milka Chocolate for Her.

But it was very short time from 14:00 pm to 15:30 pm because She had dentist appointment at 16h30 pm.

She said Only Waved Goodbye to Me but she didn't let me take her home i dont know why but i think is beacuse She was on The Phone with a friend.

I wish I had taken her home.

I greet her every day.

4,qne6ij,1636127886,I just got ghosted by someone I was dating for 4 months,"She (30F) just never responded to my response to her previous message since Tuesday. I waited and then realised last night that this is her way of calling it off. 

I don’t like weird endings like this, so I sent her a brief msg saying it was nice getting to know her and I wish her luck with her future endeavours and to take care. Thought she’d respond saying “take care” at least, and that would be that. A bittersweet ending. Nope, still ignored. 

Sucks to be honest. I’ve never been ghosted before, let alone by someone I dated for a good amount of time. I’m not best friends with my ex’s but we still wish each other on birthdays, maybe once a year/in a couple years send 5-10 texts back and forth about how life is - new job, moved locations, etc. Regular stuff. It’s crazy to find myself in such a situation when the only thing going “wrong” was a slow increase in lack of interest on her end. I saw the “break-up” coming, I was going to initiate the conversation myself this weekend.

9,qnej0d,1636128818,Best way to ask my classmate for her number or out on a date? Or if I should?,"I need some advice on how to ask out my classmate without making things awkward. To start I’m a male &amp; I’m a friendly, charming guy, so I like to interact with people &amp; participate in class. When it comes to dating or talking to girls I don’t have any issues there it’s just I don’t want to end up making things awkward for the both of us if things don’t go as I hoped. So we’re both majoring in Education &amp; taking the same class. The thing is when I first saw her I thought she was cute but that was it, for some reason as the semester keeps going on I’m starting to feel more attracted to her, idk if it’s because of the discussions we have in class or something else but whatever it is it’s working. Regardless we do interact &amp; talk from time to time but it’s not on a regular basis &amp; only in class. So I’ve been thinking, “I wonder if she finds me attractive” or if I should ask for her number &amp; let her know that I’m interested in her romantically. The thing is idk how to go about it to not make things awkward afterwards. For example, if she were to have a bf or seeing someone i don’t think she would interact with me the same way. So I was thinking maybe approaching her after class right when the semester is about to end to ask for her number &amp; possibly a date that way it’s not so awkward since we both will be done with that class or just find another way of doing it.

11,qneq9o,1636129397,Did I get stood up or what?,"There's a girl from work I recently got interested with. We work in a pretty big restaurant and always had good frequent banter over the past year. Only the other week did I start to see her in a potential romantic way. I always thought she was attractive, smart, hardworking etc. but there wasn't enough substance to justify me pursuing her any further than just another friendly coworker who was on the same wavelength as me.  

Recently she started pushing the physical barrier between us and also made a joke about how much she loved my mum (after meeting her when she came for dinner) and that she'd be her future mother in law, so I figured I'd offer to take her for a drink after our next shift is over (so we could get to know each other better), to which she responded to estactically that she hopes we go ""somewhere cool"". FFW to tonight and we seemed to have it planned, we shared when we'd both clock off (same time), both went to our respective change rooms and said we'll meet in the cafeteria, I never saw her after that. 

  
I don't have her number or socials so I couldn't ask what the deal was. Waited about half an hour in the cafeteria before going home.  I'm not angry or sad, I'm just confused to what happened. 

I guess my main question is was she too afraid to say no to me the whole time for some reason, or should I chalk it up to random events? I probably won't see her at work for a couple of days, so should I just casually ask what happened or assume she was too nervous to tell me she wasn't interested and respect her space?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qneq9o/did_i_get_stood_up_or_what/

13,qnf0wm,1636130212,NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS DUDE I MET ON BUMBLE,"So I meet this guy and we agree to meet up for Halloween (his friends and my friends). We all got along really well so afterwards we hung at my place. When we were at my place I had somewhat of an indicator something was wrong. He got drunker than everyone else and was too messed up.  

This dude was also a child star, had a ton of money, and I later found out when he’s not working he goes on benders.  

So we end up going on a date that went pretty well. We got pretty close pretty fast just because we had similar backgrounds and went through the same things. But, at the same time, I worried about his substance use (I am sober and do not want to date people that are out of control with their drinking/drug use).

So after the date he ghosts me for 2 days. I was kind of offended because I did feel like we were friends to some extent. Then, he calls me last night on a Thursday, completely wasted and saying sad stuff. Talking about how no one cares about him, his life doesn’t matter etc. I called his friend to see if his friend could go check on him, but he was out of town. His friend said he had been on a crazy bender for 2 days and he was worried about him. So he’s begging me to come over and i told him I would just for a little (kinda felt like he needed a friend cause he was not in a good mental state).  

I show up and he does not answer his phone. Some random lady let me into the building, I go to his apartment and the door is unlocked. He is passed out drunk on his couch and wouldn’t wake up. I finally got him awake and it was nuts. He was screaming, throwing stuff, running around his apartment destroying things. I told him to stop drinking for the night but he wouldn’t. I tried to tell him “look dude I don’t know you very well, but we are friends and I Care about you. I’m a little worried. Can you tell me what’s going on” He kept laughing and ignoring me. He kept saying “so? I like to party by myselfffff. EVERYONE JUST WANTS ME FOR MY MONEY” He just seems super depressed and needs helps. I tried to talk to him but he was so messed up.  

Then I got angry because he was acting NUTS. When he’s drunk he turns into a child on steroids. So I left pretty pissed off. I do care about him because I see a lot of myself in him. And I always want to save people. But there was nothing else I could do to help him.  

Then, afterwards, I impulsively met a random dude on bumble at a park nearby. Was the best date of my life. He doesn’t drink or smoke, we have similar views on life, he held my hand and was super cute.

It was mutual, healthy and we still remain friends. However, I've been a mess for quite some time now. I'm insecure, taking terrible care of myself and am overall not the best version of myself.

In September I realized that on top of all other things, I was also feeling really lonely. I decided to put myself out there again through online dating apps and went on dates with two guys. The first one didn't work out, and the second one, well...

We met up twice and today he told me that he sees us more as friends. It wasn't that I didn't agree with him, because there was no relationship spark, but I wonder if there could have been if I had been different.

I kept being clumsy, avoiding eye contact, even shared a few insecurities (which I usually never do). I used to be so confident in dating in the past. This rejection just confirmed that it's probably a terrible idea for me to start dating again, and that the way I see myself isn't just in my head but others can see it too. An obvious mess.

Doesn't take away from the fact that I still feel insanely empty though. Touch-starved and in need of giving and receiving affection. I don't know what to do.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qnflqz/22f_got_rejected_for_the_first_time_today_its/
18,qng0uk,1636132992,Why am I scared to have sex with a man I’ve been dating that I really like when in the past I’ve always been comfortable moving quickly?,"After taking a short break from dating, I am intentionally trying to take things slow and really trying to get to know anyone that I date on a deeper level before becoming attached or committing to that person. In the past I’ve rushed into having intense, sexual relationships with emotionally unavailable men. Almost all of them ended in disaster.  

Recently I met someone that is unlike any of the men that I’ve dated in the past; he is clearly looking for a serious relationship and so far we seem to have a lot in common. We’ve only gone out on 4 or 5 dates and I don’t feel any pressure to have sex with him, but I find it very strange (and I’m worried) about how nervous even the possibility makes me (to the point where I practically freeze up when I think he might make a move… this is not normal for me at all as I’m usually hyper sexual, very comfortable having sex, and have trouble waiting when I like someone).  

Don’t get me wrong - I’m grateful to be doing things the “right” way this time. But I’m hoping the lack of urgency isn’t bc I am hopelessly attracted to toxic fuckboys and he doesn’t fit the mold. I no longer want to date men that I have instant chemistry with but that aren’t healthy for me. I literally can’t do it and would rather die alone. 

Not sure what to think. Any comments or advice are welcome! 💕

30,qngppg,1636134966,Got attached too quickly- feeling silly,"I'm sort of a late bloomer when it comes to relationships and I never really experimented with dating in general until sophomore year of university, and I sort of went in guns-a-blazing. Guns didn't get to go off for very long though since I met someone I really clicked with like 4 dates in. We had all the same interests and amazing physical and romantic chemistry, and through our dates I was able to properly explore and figure out the ins and outs of how dating tended to work with someone completely understanding and compassionate to my pretty damn impressive ignorance. I was too busy thanking my lucky stars for hitting the jackpot to realize I was getting attached too quickly.

It's an odd thing getting dumped like a week after you both agreed to put a label on things, but I'm a dating novice so what do I know? Maybe this is procedure.

All I know is that I feel so stupid for feeling this bad about such a short fling. We were only dating for about 2 months but I feel like I lost something special. The ""what if's"" are killing me. The dumb little holiday plans we were starting to brainstorm together just make me feel empty when I think back to them. I keep trying to get back on the saddle and keep up the guns-a-blazing attitude I had at the start of my dating spree but I just can't. I can't go on dates without thinking of this one girl who I can hardly even call an ex and it makes me feel silly as hell- because it is. Maybe there's a lesson here? Like ""toughen up butter cup, dating sucks. get used to it"" or ""don't get attached until the 6 month mark"", but who knows really.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qngppg/got_attached_too_quickly_feeling_silly/
31,qngqtb,1636135053,I’m(m/35) In Need of advice on girlfriend (f/26) continuing to text ex boyfriends,"
Several months ago my gf was acting very suspect with her phone. I asked what was going on. She said nothing and apologized. Then we are in the car one night and a text from one of her exes popped up through car play. She panicked. I asked and after catching her in a lie she showed her text history which was riddled with her exes. Most were innocent convos, a few were guys hitting her up for hookups. I told her that made real uncomfortable and she sat there and deleted contacts and removed people from social media, on her own accord. 

Fast forward to last night, she’s in the shower, her watch is going off. I tell her and she says to read who texted. As I’m going through reading I see this doozy of a text she had sent to one of her exes talking about how she always passes the hotel they used to meet at on her way to work. 

Im over thinking long term with this gal. Is this a Red flag? Advice is appreciated

33,qngwa6,1636135459,Need some advice PLEASE,"Im a guy(25), this summer I was dating a girl(21) for a few weeks who I met off of Tinder. During that short time we had a few dates which all went great, it turned out we had a pretty good connection. We texted and snapchatted non stop throughout the days, and I began to really like this girl and was coming to the conclusion I definitely wanted to date her exclusively. We both agreed that we really liked eachother and it just felt right. I waited a few weeks to hook up with her bc I didnt wanna rush anything, and I also wanted to make sure she knew I was serious about her. So we finally hooked up and the sex was amazing, I dont wanna get to specific but it couldn't have went any better. She gave me all the compliments in the world after we finished which got me confident enough to ask her to be my girlfriend officially, she said yes. Everything was going great that night, once we turned the lights on we realized she must have had her period when we were hooking up. She got so embarrassed and instantly changed her attitude towards me, I understood but tried to reassure her it was no big deal and no one needed to know about this. The next day I texted her basically just making sure she was okay, and she texted me that we rushed into things too quickly and she needed time to herself. I was definitely bummed out and hurt, but I still wished her the best. I figured maybe she wasnt ready for a relationship bc she just got out of one previously a few months ago. Fast forward to two weeks after and we matched again on Tinder, I sent her a message but got no response, I never ended up hearing back from her on there so I gave up hope. Now fast forward to three months later today we ended up matching again on Bumble, she ended up sending me a message kinda joking/roasting me which was how we flirted with each other. This obviously gave me hope that we could actually have a run at a relationship this time. I luaghed at her joke and asked her how shes been, but I got no response which was so confusing to me. So my question is what do you think this girls deal is, does she have interest in being with me or is she just messing with me for no reason other than being a jerk?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qngwa6/need_some_advice_please/

38,qnhafm,1636136564,What do I do in this situation??,"Background info So I’m 19 and she is 20, and i can and do get girls often so it’s not like this girl was some sort of first and that’s why I can’t stop thinking about her.

So at the start of September I met this girl at a party and even though she is in a 1 year relationship (long distance with him in USA and her in Europe) we spent the whole night talking and then  fell asleep cuddling in her bed and then kissed in the morning and she told me she really liked me.

We then met for the next two days and it was amazing and we both had a good time, we did some sexual things but not have sex, but either way we had a great connection.

Then we texted and we were supposed to go out on the weekend cos we were busy in the weekday, and then suddenly one day she wanted to meet and told me that we shouldn’t do this anymore because it’s having a toll on her mental health and she has to decide whether she wants to stay with her bf or not, but It won’t be to get with me, and then when I asked whether she would want me to talk to her and stuff still, she said it would be better if I don’t.

Despite that,we did meet one more time (and idk if this makes sense but it was obvious there was still something cos she would just stare into my eyes for a good few seconds very often and then get embarrassed if that makes sense) but that was just to give back some stuff and we texted occasionally over the course of the next month and a bit and the last time we spoke was about 3 weeks ago, because I asked her if she would want to meet  but she said that there’s still the issue that was there before( which was wierd cos she literally said she wouldn’t want to be anything more than friends no matter what happened with her BF so I’m guessing she still feels something ) and somehow it turned into an argument because of some small miscommunication and we haven’t talked at all since.

Now I’m thinking about one last time just asking her out to meet or so and if that doesn’t work to just tell her okay I will delete your number and never talk to you again etc. should I do it? And if so, should I do it now or wait a bit more?

41,qnhrb0,1636137878,Should I double text?,"I'm 16, she's 16, and this is the first time I've tried this. She's a very shy person, but I noticed her staring a lot during classes, and I was already interested so I went over to her table to talk to her. After a week and a half of this, I asked for her number, and she gave it to me. I immediately sent hi it's __, and she didn't respond to that. A few days later I ask her a question about soccer as we both play the sport, and she doesn't respond. At this point I just figure she's not interested and I'm ready to move on

In the next week, she's staring  more than usual. If I'm behind her, she'll glance over her shoulder, if I move to her other shoulder she'll start looking over that shoulder, she'll stare at me in class and she'll glance at me when she passes in the halls. If I look over and make eye contact, she'll look away quickly or it will last a few seconds. The staring has been going on for a few weeks, so 5 days after I text her I ask her after class if she got the texts, she did and she said she was at soccer when she got the text, and so she couldn't respond. She apologized a lot, and has still been staring the few days it's been since I asked.

There is a mutual friend that we have that said she sometimes won't respond to her texts either, and that she's mentioned me when I'm not around. When I was at her table, she'd glance at me a lot to she how much I was paying attention to the other girl at the table, and she'll talk to me if I end up next to her before class.

The issue is, she doesn't sit with my friends anymore, so I don't have an excuse to go talk to her and I feel like I should just text her, and not call as she's shy and I don't want to freak her out.

44,qni2vi,1636138815,Ghosted by the person who asked me out?,"Exactly what the title says, but here’s the story:

Me (M22) and my coworkers had a night out and by the end of it all of us were drunk.  Normally, around of 3AM I took it upon myself to take one of my coworkers safely home (F21). As we got to her place she wouldn’t give me back my jacket and was literally begging me to spend the night with her. I refused because: 
1. it would go against my principles
2. she got out of a 2 year relationship a month ago and I don’t want to feel like a replacement to someone again.
3. I don’t want to wake up next to someone that doesn’t want my presence sober.

As I live outside that city, I took the bus and she called me. We spoke for 25 minutes in which she asked me to come back, she told me how she is too shy to approach me at work, thinks I’m very cute and any time I leave work she feels a little bit sad. But the most important part that she told me was: “when I’ll be sober, please ask me out, I’d love to go on a date with you, maybe cook for you and you’ll see that I don’t only want you when I’m drunk”.

Next day I text her to see how is she, asked if she had any regrets to which she replied “none other than the hangover”. Alright, then I asked her out to which she seemed to be excited about. The work schedule was supposed to come in next day and she told me that she’ll let me know tomorrow when she will be free to go on a date.

“Tomorrow” was a week ago, I haven’t seen her at work, could’ve told the boss to give her different shifts than mines. I am not desperate for her by any means, but it only makes me wonder why?..

I’ve been texting and dating this guy for a month already. We’ve been on chill dates with friends and by ourselves. We also assist to the same church and we both are musicians. 

Just to be clear, he was the one who approached to me first. He told me he liked me first, and has been the one to initiate everything. 
At first we talked and established that we’re going to take things slow to see what it happens… but everything we have done has been he’s idea, like, he invited me to a family gathering, he introduced me to his mom, has told a lot of friends we were like going out, etc etc. Also he was the one who first kissed me. 

Anyways, yesterday he threw a bomb at me by saying (again) he wanted to take things slow, that he wasn’t sure about everything, he likes me but he wants to be 100% sure… that he doesn’t want to hurt me, etc etc. 
I was super surprised. 

I’m kind of doubting because he sounds like he’s not sure about me and not about being in a relationship (as he says) or at least that is what I feel. I openly told him that and he reassured it was not about me but about his insecurities (which is a thing I respect). 

I’ve been before in a situation we’re a guy tells me this and was just playing. I don’t think he wants to play but I can’t shake off that feeling, maybe because my own insecurities.

When I say “make it obvious”, I mean she spelt it clearly enough for someone as oblivious as I am to understand that she seemed to like me. She’d take opportunities to hold my hand, we’d hug whenever we parted ways, we’d have deep conversations about our pasts and plans for the future. She asked for my number, and there was this one time when she wrapped her arm around me and laid her head on my shoulder. All in all, I felt we vibed quite well and I thoroughly enjoyed her company, and I made that clear to her too.

So when I texted her if she wanted to go out again some time, she responded saying she just wants to be friends and that she didn’t want to give me the wrong impression.

Unsurprisingly, this came as a bit of a shock. How could she just want to be friends when all the signs seemed to point to mutual romantic interest? Still, I took the L and I’m now working to get my feelings for her out of my system and move on.

But I don’t really know what lesson I should take from this experience. Should I always be skeptical even when a girl is making it clear she likes me? But surely that can’t be helpful going forwards?

65,qnjz9n,1636144345,Ghosted by girl after our hookup,"Hey everyone

So recently I matched with a girl on tinder and we began the usual chatting and what not. Eventually we decided to meet at her place and we did the usual put on a show, cuddle, and eventually make out. 

I want to point out that I am a virgin and this was one of my first encounters with a girl like this so I was kinda nervous. She even pointed out how my heart was beating really fast. 

Well the making out escalated to us taking off our clothes and when that happened I lost my Hard on. I figured it’ll come back with more foreplay but it didn’t. That’s when I started to figure I was getting performance anxiety. Seeing how things where turning out and I didn’t want to make her feel bad I asked if I could eat her out and to my shock she said no which honestly surprised me. After trying for 30 minutes we decided to call it quits. I do want to point out she was supportive throughout the ordeal and was gently caressing me saying it’s okay.

The next day I texted her to let her know it wasn’t because I found her unattractive , I figured maybe she thought something was wrong with her. She was cool about it saying it happens and she even asked if I was willingly to try again. I told her I’d let her know later in the week what’s up. Later in the week I tell her I’ll be free Saturday but it’s been two days and she hasn’t responded. Normally I’d say life happens but before she’d respond within the day.

Basically I want to ask you guys did she lose interest? Did she think because I couldn’t get hard that I wasn’t worth her time? I know it’s silly to dwell on a tinder hookup, but I’d be lying if I’d say this wasn’t a blow to my confidence.

66,qnk297,1636144590,A girl (F20) blocked me (M21) after seeing what I look like.,"Somehow I met this girl online. I didn’t know what she looked like and she didn’t know how I looked like. We chatted for days about so much and we had so much fun. We shared to much information that I know who she is, what her surname is, where she lives etc. 

I really felt I made a connection with a girl this time. We chatted for days. It made me feel good! I had read online that someone will just show up when you wouldn’t expect it to happen. This was exactly the case. I never had this kind of connection with a girl before. 

After almost a week she wanted to know how I looked like. I hesitated at first, because I normally do not feel comfortable showing my pictures online. However she already send a picture of herself. So I got enough confidence to share one of mine. I thought: we texted for a few days know what could go wrong. She said it was a nice picture. It really made me feel amazing! Finally I knew what it feels when a girl likes you. I had the best days of my life. 

After sharing my picture she said that she went to sleep. I didn’t think much about it since it was already late and I had to get up early for work. 

The next day I wanted to text her how she was doing and I noticed she had blocked me. NOOO I felt my heartbeat in my throat and I panicked for a moment. I checked it a few times and yes I was really blocked. 

I felt like my entire world collapsed and all my happiness was gone. I was so confused. Afterwards I felt so bad. Not only I lost a connection, but also a chance to go on my first date ever. I never had a girlfriend before or went on a date. I thought that this maybe could be it. Man this is so harsh.

68,qnk660,1636144919,Demisexual (male 27) and feel barred from all prospects of a relationship.,"I'm  a male 27 years old, somewhat attractive physically, and reasonably fit (but a little shy),  I'm an artist, and a musician and have more than a few interesting  talking points about myself (at least.. I hope).  I have been in a  single longterm relationship in my life, with only one sexual partner.  Things went downhill quite badly when she started college and mixed with a bad crowd and got into alcohol and drugs. Not going into any details  but she caused me more pain than anyone should put up with.

For over a year after leaving her I carried a dark cloud over my head, so I  wasn't really in the mood for any sort of courtship. It's only recently  that I started emerging out of that state and doing things for myself.

When  I entered my first relationship, I was at the beginning of my 20s, and  neither of us knew what we were doing. I still don't know what I'm doing. Everything from my body language to what to say, to how polite or  how forward I should be.

I don't  know if I have much romance in me now. I just want a friend. A true friend that is as attracted to me physically as I am to them. In the most honest of terms one I can have sex with in outlandish kinky ways and go straight back to normal the next day. But those two things never seem to allign in the same person. My standards aren't high beyond the woman being interesting. I don't even have the luxury of preferences, but i'm not having great luck.

I freeze up before the rare prospect of a one-night-stand and decline. Without familiarity I feel on edge. Conversely, when I begin to know someone  quite well, I start to feel strong attraction, but they no longer feel  quite so into me. Is familiarity a turn-off in general?

Multiple  online friends have told me I am Demisexual. In my unique experience, I  am depressed, lonely and sexually repressed. But I don't feel strong  attraction to anyone until I really get to the meat and bones of who  they are as a person.

I don't know how to quite explain it without it sounding generic but...  
When  I make friends with a girl, It is not for any ulterior motive, If any motive can be truly pure. I do it because I am alone and there is mutual  interest. Meeting people is the gateway to many things. Jobs, hobbies,  more friends. It's an important thing to try and do. I'm not cultivating  friendships explicitly so that they can evolve into relationships, but a  relationship is still something I am looking for so it will be in the  back of my mind.  
However when I choose to act on my developing  feelings and try to flirt a bit, and move that friendship into a more carnal direction It  never works. I think because it's a shock, or it makes me appear disingenuous, like that is what I always wanted out of it, and the dynamic has settled into an assumption that these worlds should remain  separate. It also hurts to hear about their usually wretched experiences  with other men and it makes me feel quite small, knowing that I want to  give them everything they're looking for in others and more, but from  where they're sitting I can't supply it.  
Nobody is obligated to be attracted to me, but the primal feelings of being demasculated are still there. Especially when the kind of person she's into is the kind you butted heads with historically. The kind who doesn't have to try to get what he wants, doesn't value it and discards it for something new.  
After  that we continue the friendship, and it either lasts or it doesn't.  That or I squash those feelings down because I do not want to jeopardize  it and I know from chemistry or something that they would never be  accepted.

I have ruined at least two friendships by being honest about how my feelings had developed for the person.

On top of that it aint too easy to make friends anyway.

* All  my old friends have moved to opposite ends of the country, or to  entirely new countries. Those still reachable are either too busy or too  heavily invested in their own relationships for me to meet people via  friend networking
* I live out in the boonies so I don't have much prospect of chance meetings.
* I've  tried online dating for half a year now.  Not to generalize but online  dating seems somewhat stacked against males in terms of how attention is  divided.
* Every  time i've matched it's always rested on my shoulders to singlehandedly  carry a conversation, or they simply blank me after reading my reply.  I'm becomming hyper-self analytical about everything I say now, and I  don't like it, as when I talk to someone I usually humour them even if  they've broken a boundary.
* I'm hesitant to hang out in bars alone, I also am frustrated by seeing overtly drunk people considering my history.
* My  work is online, and although I make contact with and make friends with  many people through it, they are only acquaintances, and are also  scattered all over the world.

The  only place i've had any success is in hostels while travelling, as the  people I've met have been gregarious and interested in exchanging life  stories, or i've been with a more confident friend who gives me the  confidence.  But even then, It's for an evening and after that the  mystique that attracted them to me in the first place has gone.

Her calling cops on her family and then moving in with me. Us breaking up and her calling my mom saying how we had sex in hotels and then calling cops on me. 

We got married in secret and divorced pretty soon after.

72,qnkhel,1636145885,Ghosted by the person who asked me,"Here’s the story:

Me (M22) and my coworkers had a night out and by the end of it all of us were drunk.  Normally, around of 3AM I took it upon myself to take one of my coworkers safely home (F21). As we got to her place she wouldn’t give me back my jacket and was literally begging me to spend the night with her. I refused because: 
1. it would go against my principles
2. she got out of a 2 year relationship a month ago and I don’t want to feel like a replacement to someone again.
3. I don’t want to wake up next to someone that doesn’t want my presence sober.

As I live outside that city, I took the bus and she called me. We spoke for 25 minutes in which she asked me to come back, she told me how she is too shy to approach me at work, thinks I’m very cute and any time I leave work she feels a little bit sad. But the most important part that she told me was: “when I’ll be sober, please ask me out, I’d love to go on a date with you, maybe cook for you and you’ll see that I don’t only want you when I’m drunk”.

Next day I text her to see how is she, asked if she had any regrets to which she replied “none other than the hangover”. Alright, then I asked her out to which she seemed to be excited about. The work schedule was supposed to come in next day and she told me that she’ll let me know tomorrow when she will be free to go on a date.

“Tomorrow” was a week ago, I haven’t seen her at work, could’ve told the boss to give her different shifts than mines. I am not desperate for her by any means, but it only makes me wonder why?.. 

I mean how is it even possible to ask someone out and then ghost?

A few days later I ask her a question about soccer as we both play the sport, and she doesn't respond. At this point I just figure she's not interested and I'm ready to move on

In the next week, she's staring more than usual. If I'm behind her, she'll glance over her shoulder, if I move to her other shoulder she'll start looking over that shoulder, she'll stare at me in class and she'll glance at me when she passes in the halls. If I look over and make eye contact, she'll look away quickly or it will last a few seconds. The staring has been going on for a few weeks, so 5 days after I text her I ask her after class if she got the texts, she did and she said she was at soccer when she got the text, and so she couldn't respond.

91,qnlukf,1636149925,reconnecting with your crush,"Hi guys. I hope you can help me a little bit and it's about the fact that I just can't forget my crush. 
On January during the Corona Pandemic, I found her by chance on Instagram, slid into her DM’s and got her number right after. The problem at that time was the distance because she lives in the neighboring country. The writing also went almost 2 months every day, we have always flirted and promised to meet us as soon as possible. She was just the one for me without ever seeing her in person. However, she has lost interest over time, has written less and the times between messages became longer and longer until she told me that she does not want to meet a person only via chat because at that time travelling was impossible. 

This has shaken me deeply because I thought we  really had a lot in common and she was exactly my type. However, I have resigned myself to it. Time has passed until July and I had to spend a month in her hometown because of my work. I dm'ed her right away to meet up. But she refused, because she has a boyfriend at the moment and since then there was radio silence between us again. My plan had also been, after graduation, to move to the city where she lives because further education is much better there. 

During the whole summer months I traveled a lot to forget her and to see the world, but with time I had the feeling that she had broken up with her boyfriend. I'm still not sure if that's true though since she rarely posts her personal life on Instagram. One of the cities I went to was London. I posted a story when I was there and was immediately messaged by her because she was also in London at the time. I thought it was fate to meet her in person, but was disappointed again as she was flying back to her home country the day I arrived. 
I can't get her out of my mind because I always have the hope that she broke up with her boyfriend.

Now the question is whether I should write to her again since my studies will be over soon and I'll be back in her hometown for the summer. Should I lowkey put her on my close friends list on Instagram so she sees more of me?

92,qnlzgo,1636150339,He checks every box for me but I still feel like something is missing?,"I (F23) met someone (M25) a little over a month ago who literally checks every box for me. When I first saw him, there was an instant attraction. The night we met, we hit it off and very quickly got to know one another. He honestly is and has everything I've ever looked for in a guy. At first, I was incredibly excited and so drawn to him. Even though it's only been a month, I'm really happy but I don't really feel any excitement anymore. Maybe I'm still getting to know him and my feelings still have to grow, but he just seems way more into it than I am and it's making me feel like something is missing for me. Maybe I'm just used to games and guys that aren't right for me that I became addicted to the chase and the ups and downs.

One thing I should add is that we've yet to have sex. I'm a very physical person and I tend to sleep with my partners very early in the relationship, so waiting this long is something I'm not used to at all. I think maybe even this is what's missing and is what I need to feel closer to him or to feel any sort of excitement again, I don't know.

I'm probably overthinking the entire situation and I'm just not used to something that's actually good for me. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Am I just looking for reasons to self-sabotage a good thing?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qnlzgo/he_checks_every_box_for_me_but_i_still_feel_like/
93,qnm9bk,1636151176,Scared of being single forever? Positive thought,"This may be the wrong sub so apologies. 
But I keep thinking after this breakup I won't find anyone else yada yada.

My ex told me something when I was unemployed and looking for work. I was moaning about it and saying that I'll never get a job etc. He said this fact and it was so simple - ""everyone finds one eventually"" 

And I couldn't really deny it. Most people are able to find work eventually if they look enough.

Same with dating. Most average people end up in a long term relationships. Most people find someone and settle down in life.

 Hate to break it to you but if you're reading this now you are probably pretty average and most likely a normal, unremarkable person. So the odds are high for you finding someone. This is especially true if you're young

Plus if you're here it means you have already dated someone who you liked and it's very likely you'll find someone else you like again. 

No one knows when exactly and that's the hard part. But relax you're already dating material and you will probably settle down like everyone does eventually.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qnm9bk/scared_of_being_single_forever_positive_thought/

We didn’t have sex for long it was very short and then he didn’t try again. I asked why and he mentioned he is nauseous. This went on for days until I asked him to tell me what was up. He said I smelt bad and I am so confused because I really Pride myself in smelling good and taking care of my V. I did go pick up my usual products from target and we tried again. He said it still smelt but I smelt myself and I smell like my normal self. To be honest I’ve had plenty of guys love eating me and say how good I smell. Right now I took his car and am just sitting in target parking lot because I don’t know what to do and I kind of want to go back home now.

98,qnmiry,1636151977,He (23M) ghosted me and then followed my friend,"I've (23F) been talking to 23M since June but was ghosted beginning of last month. Whilst we were talking everything seemed nice and he knew all the right things to say. We couldn't meet the first two months of talking because I was sick and once I recovered he was out of town. During that time I really thought he was a decent man who would treat me the way I hope to be treated by a S/O. However, it was all talk. When he returned he wouldn't stop with the ""I can't wait to see you"" and the ""I want you""s but there was nothing to show for it. Because he's currently in medical school I gave him a lot of excuses and always said it was because he's busy and/or tired. But let me tell you, this man goes out with his friends every weekend for dinner, drinks, etc... I realized it wasn't that he didn't have time, he just didn't have time for me. I realized this when I asked him what he was doing one weekend and he said, ""nothing planned yet but if I'm free you're first priority."" I thought I might be overthinking, but it felt like he was saying that if I don't have plans then I'll act like I want to see you. You can probably guess, we didn't meet that weekend and he went out again. At this point, I was kind of over it. We had only met once to study together and honestly I was smitten, if I hadn't been I would've jumped ship long ago. Finally, I want to just get it over with and end it but not with lingering regret. He wouldn't ask me out, so I asked him out. ""Hey, if you're free next Thursday or Friday, do you wanna join me for dinner."" Simply put, I was left on read. This was over a month ago, and yesterday, out of nowhere he followed one of my closest friends on Instagram. They have never spoken or met before but they did have other mutuals. It was a bit strange but what's weirder is he liked one of her photos and then unfollowed her today. What does this all mean? I'm confused, maybe not confused enough to reach out to him but this feels silly and immature.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qnmiry/he_23m_ghosted_me_and_then_followed_my_friend/
99,qnmj88,1636152018,I really can't keep being optimistic anymore.,"M27 nurse.

It's been two years since I had sex or a real date. 

In this time I wasted a hundred dollars or so on dating apps, tried to improve myself, get myself out there but...

It's failing. 

The apps resulted in two dates and around 4 matches in all. I got rejected 43 times in person and failed to secure dates. My ex found someone in a month or so by using Tinder to judge people for fun with her friends. It was my first relationship too. 

Everyone I know except a guy or so is in a relationship or having success in dating. My coworkers are all females and engaged. None know single women past 20. Had ""interest"" from mental health patients (Cmon I wont touch those, it's unhetical anyway.) and one of the girl I met on Tinder. But I didn't feel interest towards her.

I'm getting desperate. People from my culture are cold and closed to new people, they're quick to bundle up and settle and judge single people pretty harshly. Especially men. Especially since I'm from a more conservative, spread out area. 

I'm not ugly, but not conventionally average either. I have a lot of French and First nation blood. Unique face it makes. 

I got nothing for two years and it's exasperating me. It's just completely failing and I'm trying to not put pressure on myself, but Christ... It's always in the back of my mind and taunting me. 

What *should* I do ? Because falling asleep and going through everything alone is getting VERY old VERY quickly.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qnmj88/i_really_cant_keep_being_optimistic_anymore/
