I am writing this post as I am upset at the fact I Can't seem to get In a relationship I have always wanted to settle down long term and get married have my own family I want a relationship where I get to know her as a friend first where I'm
Loved for the person I am and how I make them feel that's what I want a relationship based on love support friendship 

I'm not following advice on Reddit which is diet lose weight get toned I'm sorry to say I disagree about looks I'm afraid and I'm not making myself look a certain way or dress a certain way I'm also not mentioning my job or how much money I earn or where I live because that shouldn't matter 

I am not looking for one thing I want a serious loving committed relationship but I'm not interested in dating apps I think online dating as well as bars and clubs are the wrong way to go I can't pick someone from a photograph or a few photos and decide there for me I just can't so I'm staying away from  online dating 

I'm just feeling upset very low at the moment and I've had bad anxiety about being alone in life I just need some support

I think she would rather do something more formal than going to a dining hall. 

I'm kind of pressed for ideas. 

Within walking distance, there's nothing all that nice. There's a sandwich joint that I'd like to try. Even still, this is like a half-mile walk and I don't know if she would prefer to stay out of the cold as much as possible. 

There's also a few, maybe more eclectic, ideas I've heard people do on campus, like reserving a classroom (which you are allowed to do for any purpose; people use them for clubs and study groups all the time) and watching a movie on the projector.

My best friend has a bf of 4 years but she definitely finds my bf attractive. When I first showed her a picture of him, she made this extremely weird comment saying “wow he’s black? if me and my bf break up, i’m going back to only dating black guys” 

Their first time meeting was at a party she was hosting. She was very overly friendly anytime they interacted, my bf even noticed it too and told me on the drive home. My friend sent me a bunch of texts saying she really likes my bf and hopes I don’t break things off with him because she can tell he is such a good guy. The next day she asked me for his phone number. She said it was to “thank him for coming to the party” I thought that was weird because I could just relay the message? I ignored her text then she followed up with “I also want to contact him in case something happens to you when you visit him” (me and my bf are LDR)

I think I'm reaching a point that I'm trying to understand his personality rather than date him. lol. and below is what happened. and i try my best to be as objective as possible.

\-----

So I matched with this guy on tinder and the conversation flowed well at the begining, he mentioned that he was very shy and he love comedy and had been taking some improv classes so that he could break free of his shell and have long conversations. 

Then we've pretty much seen each other every weekend, doing outdoor activities together. And about we hang out 5/6 times, gradually, he started to share little bit of personal things with me, for example, he comes from a nonsocial/emotional divorced family who always fights, and he needs to do surgery in the upcoming year. Because I personally don't like sharing too much personal information in the early stage of dating(i value privacy), so I am pretty much just being a listener, and he said he felt heard and safe and got some emtional support from me.

Just because I felt like every time we hang out is just doing activities together, I wanna something deep, so I decided to initiate more conversations with him. and I noticed that the more questions that I try to ask, the more defensive/sensitive he becomes, the more ""conflict"" that we have. I'm not sure if this is gaslighting/manipulating or he just has low self-esteem or he's shy or he's oversensitive or im being too intimidated?

\-----

exhibit 1: we were on the phone call, he was randomly mentioned that he got a gift from a female friend, and she confused his birthday got him a month early. then i asked him what are you going to do tmr, he said, im going to play this gif (it's a toy). for some reason, my instinct is telling me that he wants to test the water to see where he stands between us, so i answered pretty aggressively, ""well! enjoy your toy then!"" and he said, he felt attacked by me. (to be fair, i was using an aggressive tone) so i confront him, saying, ‘’are you trying to get me jealous?"" he said, “partly, yes, but i didn't expect you will have that emotional reaction and i did feel uncomfortable.“ i said, “but what's your expectation then?"" he said, “well, there is no expectation, people won't mention anything about it. and I do have some female friends, and i hope that's ok with you. i want to let she know that she's not the only girl in my world.""  i said, ""i also have guy friends. but by telling me that is to show you're popular???""  he said, ""hmmm, yes. i just want this girl to like me more.“  (then we hung up the phone)  (please help me to analyze his mentality lol)

&amp;#x200B;

exhibit 2: just because i did have that emotional reaction before, so i felt like i need to be a more mature person to address this, so i explained to him that my ex was often doing those tricks to make sure i still care about him, but when it reaches to a point, i just feel annoyed, that's why i got triggered for this emotional reaction. then he said, well, i forgive you! (i was like what??i wasn't apologizing. idk, i feel like usually, guys will say, oh, no worries, it's not your fault, i promise i won't do this to you. or even lol, you don't need to explain, i got you! something like that? but not like I forgive you???) but he did follow up with what reaction were i expecting from him. i said i would like to see your raw reaction.

&amp;#x200B;

exhibit 3: recently, (in text form) he said, he picked up a new hobby, which is crossword game. so i said, you love mental stimulation, (then we played a few rounds), i asked, why you are into those mental stimulation? he answered, “this question feels like you are looking down on me.” (i didn't reply immediately) he then said, ""but you probably don't mean it that way.""

&amp;#x200B;

i viewed myself as a non-confrontational person, more of a passive-aggressive person. so whenever, i felt so uncomfortable by those random conflicts, i just gave him the silent treatment (by not replying him). then after 1-2 days, he will reach out to me, to ask if i am ok. is there anything i want to share, about my feeling and stuff. he would like to hear it out. 

\-------

so I'm just not sure if he is a narcissist who tries to gaslight me to play this power dynamic game or he truly is being so sensitive so that he just wants to share all his feelings with me but does not know what kind of emotional support a girl wants?

31,qk9lhe,1635755621,NSFW ? Small penis but dream man,"Hi guys
This is such a vapid post and I never thought I'd say something like this but I have met my dream man, he ticks all of my boxes and we connect like crazy, its wild because I just got divorced after 7yrs with my ex so I'm very aware of the fact this guy is an exceptional fit for me.

I really could spend my life with this man but.... I can't get past the fact he has a small, thin penis. I know I'm awful.
My ex husband was a tall guy and his penis was about 9inches. And this guy isn't even half that.

My question is, is there a way I can get past the penis size? I enjoy penetrative sex more than any other style.

I wish I could get over it and be with him properly but it's definitely holding me back.

He's also quite big and not my physical type, so that also doesn't do much for me?

Ticks all boxes except the physical and I wonder if it's possible to be with someone long term without that attraction?

32,qk9oms,1635756059,Am I overreacting?,"Mad at guy I’m dating - am I overreacting??

I told guy I’m dating he did something shitty that upset me (too long of a story, he did something hurtful) He calls me his girlfriend but doesn’t act like a boyfriend. 
It’s been four months. 

I texted him in the morning saying I was upset. He acknowledged my message this morning and said he would reply later. Then goes off to a concert with his friends and has a grand old time. Sends me a photo of him at the concert and says he knows he owes me a proper response but just wanted to share he’s having a lot of fun. 

He doesn’t text me in the evening either and the day has passed. I get he is tired. Am I overreacting or is it too much to expect some sort of longer form of response at least by end of day?

I don’t feel like a priority and feel secondary to him having a fun time.

34,qk9sc6,1635756621,How to achieve success with online dating,"Hello,

I am a 27 year old male that has been using online dating for 5 years.

During this time I haven't had much success, I've only been on 3 Tinder dates and they all led nowhere. 

I am 5ft 9inch (175cm), but I struggle to attract women. I have ginger hair and pale skin with some freckles (although they are fading, thankfully) I was in great shape in my early twenty's but I struggled to attract women anyways. Now I have gained weight, so I'm carrying a few extra pounds but I'm determined to lose it.

I have signed up to eHarmony and messaged lots of women, I am hopeful as after one month of using the service I found a match, I am hoping it leads somewhere. 

Should you still go on a date with somebody if you don't find them physically attractive? The reason why I am asking is that, I am realistically an average looking guy. I feel like I have to take my options avaliable and that I can't be too picky.

41,qkaakv,1635759079,Why is a toxic relationship okay vs. not? Surprised to find arguments for both.,"I don’t understand how increasingly noticeable toxic relationships are being viewed as just the way things are and despite openly feeling unhappy/betrayed/hurt by most aspects, are still together. Not just from a social media/online view but from actual coworkers/friends/family. These relationships can involve one parter being a serial cheater, violent drunk, or having any typical deal breakers that would make you question why they’re still together. Not being bound in any way and free to leave but they don’t. And they’re self aware to the toxicity and how other healthy ex-relationships compared, but the main defense being how much love is being received/shared despite all of that. Maybe you’d guess the parents relationship examples could reflect theirs, but they’ve come from healthy households already. It makes me wonder if the definition of finding the right person who’s love can be greater/equal without most of the toxic traits can still hold true. Is nothing crossing the line after a certain amount of time? Is the work of starting over that much worse?

Not sure if this is the best way to describe this topic, but I’m wondering if anyone has left, or is still in these type of relationships and has something to say about it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qkaakv/why_is_a_toxic_relationship_okay_vs_not_surprised/

my question is how shall I do it, I had 3 plans, your advice on which is most appropriate will be greatly appreciated 

plan a) I send flowers + Teddy + chocs
with a card that has a nice message in it but anonymously signed. then the following day I print off a blank prescription, write her name 

then where the medication detail and dosage usually is, write my name, my number and the dose/duration.  I.e until the sun sets in the god damn west 🤣. followed by a hint the flowers were from me.


plan b) I do that minus the flowers( is that too strong?)


plan c) I call her out after work, we walk to her car and I tel her how much I like her, and that I want her number and want to take her out.( issue with this one I'd iv been told by several people its putting all my cards on the table which is a bad idea)

It usually leads to me ghosting them or otherwise flaking out so many times that they lose interest... I know if probably comes across that I'm hiding something, but I panic so hard that I feel like it would be impossible to pretend that I'm confident.  


It's really hard on me because I know I deserve happiness, support, and respect as a human and that has no bearing on my dress size.

Early summer I met a dude on a concert, didn't think of anything. He texts me if I want a drink since he figured we got along quite well. I declined first cause I was having a tinder thing going on.
Then, 2 months ago, I asked whether he was still interested - we went on ~5 dates, kissed and yeah. We share the same taste in music (like exactly the same!!!!) and are both sensitive characters. He then told me, however, that the general feeling he perceives isn't the best, and the thought of sharing his story with me makes him uncomfortable.
To me, this is such a profound thing that I immediately tried to accept this as rejection to get over it asap, being super sad of course cause I've not been interested in a man in a while... He texts me the next day, asking what i was thinking - I told him about it, he says we should talk again and not be alone with our feelings. I text him about the mixed signals I'm getting, that I dont know how to feel - he just started a super busy job, therefore said he didn't have time to write down his thoughts, but that of course he is thinking a lot about it.
Since that I've been waiting for an answer - like 2 days now, and I'm so annoyed... If it was of any importance to him, he surely would have found time to text me?

Anyway, I matched with a very attractive girl on Tinder on Saturday morning, we chatted for a bit and she'd asked if was going out that evening as an early Halloween. I did have plans with friends and so I said yeah, turns out she was also going to the same place and seemed keen to meet up. Evening rolls around and the club we'd ended up at was super busy, and I was trying to contact her whilst I was in there to meet. However had no luck, she'd said she had to leave early due to her friend getting spiked, which is obviously understandable. During that evening I'd also managed to dislocate my knee at the club, very painful and went to A&amp;E yesterday to get that sorted. I'd kept chatting with the girl yesterday who was being very nice and supportive given my injuries and had offered to help me out if needed. I'd politely said there wasn't anything I needed but if she wanted to hang out at my house and stuff the company would be much appreciated. Again, she seemed keen and asked for my address so I provided that and said take out was on me. I'd asked what time I should expect to see her but got no reply, couple hours later she messages saying sorry she fell asleep. So I'd said that's okay and asked if she still wanted to come over and she'd said ""if you want me too"" so I'd said yes of course and asked her to let me know when she'd set off and stuff. Another hour or so passes so I sent her a voice note just asking if she'd gotten cold feet as I understand I am basically a stranger still. She'd sent one back saying she didn't have cold feet she just had hangover head. Not entirely sure what that is, but I can take a good guess. Anyhow, I left it at that and tried to get some sleep, following on this morning I'd sent a fairly lengthy message just saying I hoped she felt better this morning and that I'd still be up for meeting sometime when I'm more functional. Unfortunately though, I've been unmatched and removed off of Snapchat. Am I right to feel slightly lead on here? Or is there something I've done drastically wrong here?

He semi-came clean but I learned after that he still lied about multiple aspects of who he was. One day he sent me a snapchat and his work badge was in the background. Fortunately, my friends work in the same place and after a brief description of what I knew physically, I found out who he truly was. He had a girlfriend of five years. 

He and I got on really well, our personalities are very similar and interests. I felt quite upset by this after giving him several chances in the past, he said he felt insecure and didn’t use his real pictures (he is attractive) and I believed him but it was because he had a girlfriend instead. 

I messaged the girlfriend, they split. 

He recently messaged me as him after three months, apologising and saying he wants to properly try again. We do have such a unique way of connecting but I’m just not 100% sure I can commit to someone who has lied and cheated.

79,qkesb1,1635775714,Recreational drug use and dating,"Hi Reddit,

I’ve (22F) recently been dating a guy (26M), this my first time dating after 2 year dating break and therapy.

I’m very determined to voice concerns and remain true to myself this time, without going to from one extreme (ignoring my needs) to another (not compromising at all)

We’ve been dating for a month now, We’ve hung out about 4 times, I really like him, we seem to be a good match with a lot of things, conversation flows well, the sex is really good and we seem to already be quite comfortable in eachother’s company.

The last time I saw him, there was some conversations about recreational drug use. Him saying he occasionally likes to participate since a lot of his friends are into it and that it’s interesting but he’s careful about it. My first thought and reaction was that I’m not very comfortable with anything beyond weed and alcohol but I was open to hearing his point of view. 
I didn’t take any strong stances yet because I wanted to go away and think about it first.

This is the first time I’ve been put in a situation to figure out to what extent I’m comfortable with drug usage. I grew up in a sheltered home and have honestly not had much interest or curiosity to break out of my “don’t do drugs kids” mentality and the circles I normally hang out with are the same, so I understand some of my discomfort comes from lack of exposure but I also don’t want to dismiss the usual concerns like addiction, general safety etc.

I was hoping to have a proper conversation about this next time to figure out what his definition of “not very often” is etc. But as someone that isn’t really part of that world, I’m not sure how much is too much, what is concerning and what is not and generally what to look out for and was hoping you could help me with that.


My initial thoughts are:
1) how often does this happen?
2) what drugs does he normally take?
3) what occasions call for this for him?
4) how often do his friends do it? Would I eventually be able to hang out with them without all that?
5) what’s your definition of “careful”?

Ultimately i feel I could deal with it if I wasn’t ever pressured to participate, i knew he was safe and wasn’t reliant on it and it basically wouldn’t have major consequences on him or us, and that this is a truly responsible once every now and then recreational activity. But as you can tell I’ve acknowledging that I don’t know enough about it so I don’t want to blindly draw a red line.

I just want to know how to gage these things.

Thank you for your help in advance",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qkesb1/recreational_drug_use_and_dating/

The reason why I broke up is because he wouldn't stop making snarky jokes about my spending habits, so it was easy to break up than to explain myself

He's wealthy, so the way he handles his finances is an absolute disaster. I can't believe how extremely reckless he was with money. A jug of milk half full is thrown in the trash; half of the food he orders is found in the garbage; overpriced coffee every day of course; useless clothes weekly; lazy af to keep track of tax filings; nothing goes to savings; insane spending on alcohol; doesn't shop around, only picks what's available at ridiculous premiums; and a bunch of other reckless habits.

I don't mean it in a derogatory way, of course. He's free to do that, I just want to highlight the contrast here so I can get better advice.

Me on the other hand, I grew up dirt poor. Lived between basements and studio apartments w/ mom &amp; sister, barely had anything to eat for years. After school however (which I finished last spring lol), everything improved dramatically, something I could never dream of. This year is the first year I don't have to worry about food or shelter for me and my family. As I started getting into dating, my spending habits from my childhood are showing huge contrast. I am naturally extra cautious with money, really really cautious, but within a reasonable band. The subject ex kept making jokes about it, and it was really hard to swallow. I'm sure he didn't mean to offend me, but it just weighs me down. Just to give you a sense of ridiculous it was, one time I baked mini pies for a party and there was an extra piece of dough left. I got it together and made other things out of it, he joked that I'm too cruel to let the garbage man earn his wage....... Seriously...... 😑 (Rich people are henceforth not allowed to make jokes)
