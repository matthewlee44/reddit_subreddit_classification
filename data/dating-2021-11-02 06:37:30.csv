1,ql2em5,1635853562,How do I ask her out quickly?,"
There‚Äôs been a shy coworker of mine who‚Äôs pretty cute and after a month of hesitation, I decided to go talk to her. We found a common interest (anime) and I got her Snapchat. She is super shy like she doesn‚Äôt talk to anyone else at the workplace unless someone talks to her first. Even when someone is talking to her she just answers the questions and doesn‚Äôt really ask the other person questions about them. I‚Äôve experienced these as well. She‚Äôs so shy and introverted that she‚Äôll avoid eye contact with me if I walk by her even tho I‚Äôm clearly in her view. 

I‚Äôve lost quite a bit of interest due to her lack of communication but still have a sliver of hope because she did say that I‚Äôm the only guy in the warehouse she talks to like this and I‚Äôm just trying to ask her out. I don‚Äôt really care if she says no since I‚Äôve lost some interest so what‚Äôs a good way of asking her out or trying to find out if she likes me or not?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ql2em5/how_do_i_ask_her_out_quickly/

7,ql2qa9,1635854785,I (35F) Got stood up on Sunday and yesterday he (31M) texted me a lame excuse. I feel confused and I don't understand his behavior.,"I've been dating this guy for a month and things were going ok so far. We had had 3 very intense dates with heavy makeout sessions, we'd FaceTime every time and he'd tell me how he adored me and liked to talk to me. And he knew I'd only have sex with him in a committed relationship but he decided to carry on. So on Friday we had decided we would go out on Sunday and he always confirms the date and picks me up at my place and this time he just stood me up.

On Sunday morning he sent me videos and pics of him on a Halloween party he attended on Saturday, he was Spiderman because everybody says he looks like Tom Holland and he likes to emphasize it (very immature to me, but anyway). I said a few things about the pics he sent me at 11am, he left me on read then didn't say anything else. At all.

Sunday evening came, and I realized I had been stood up. I thought he'd ghost me and never say anything to me ever again, then yesterday, Monday, he texts me at 2pm saying

""Oh, I thought my message yesterday had gone through. Yesterday I was very hungover and because I had to work today I decided to take a rest yesterday. Sorry. How are you?""

What a pathetic excuse. We talk on WhatsApp and he had been online all night and in the morning when I woke up his last seen time was 2am. He was definitely not taking a rest and I am pretty sure he would have had 10 seconds to text me a"" I'm hungover, can't see you right now"" message.

So 4 hours later I replied to his message and said ""That's alright. Got it."" and said ""I'm fine"" to his ""How are you?"" (definitely did not ask ""and you?""). So my texts were basically ""That's alright. Got it. I'm fine"". 

Then he left me on read again and didn't say anything else. My question is: why do people do this? Why even text an apology if it's not even a real apology? Why do people take other people's intelligence for granted?

What did he really want with this apology? He wanted to reconnect? He just wanted to feel good about himself? He's immature and because I sent him a cold reply he didn't know what else to say? Is this kind of attitude common? Am I dating a man child? Are things going to end this way? So many questions in my mind, but I still don't understand the modern dating world. Sorry for the rant, it's just that to me this is utterly bizarre and what he did just shows how amazingly immature he is.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ql2qa9/i_35f_got_stood_up_on_sunday_and_yesterday_he_31m/

So I met this guy online. This happened around March...(he goes to the same uni as me and he's is my best friend's friend.) Let's call him guy X. He's really attractive and outgoing.. We used to text all night.. and it would go on till 3-4am... But he would never text back during the day time... I used to crush on him soo hard- it was unhealthy  I know, but yeah... I used to wait for him to text back and would be miserable if he didn't text back... We met in uni (once or twice)... and now we're good friends. But after talking to him for a while.. I realized that he isn't my type.. (he isn't serious about his future..) But we're still good friends- we text occasionally,  talk when we bump into each other...  But I don't like him like I used too...

A few week after I met guy X, Guy Y started texting me (we are in the same class) He's a funny guy, sensitive, caring.. everything I possibly want in a guy.. We tease each other and give each other space... He replies to my texts... He motivates me when I'm down- He makes me smile...‚ù§Ô∏é I like him. 

Guy X is not in my class
Guy Y is in my class

But I'm confused... I met Guy X in March and Guy Y in the same month... I started liking Guy Y around May and admitted my feelings to myself a few weeks ago...  Do you think that I'm a player? I moved from guy X to Y in a few weeks... (haven't dated either of them just crushing...) Do I like Guy Y coz he's treating me right? 

Guy Y likes me.... he hasn't told me yet. But his friend told my friend and she told me that guy  Y likes me... The same thing goes for Guy Y- he knows that I have feelings for him- but we haven't gotten to the part where we admit our feelings for each other...

21,ql3zp1,1635859016,I think I understand where the misunderstanding between men and women occur in dating advice,"So I‚Äôve been doing some thinking and I think I finally understand it where the failure in communication is.

When women give dating advice to men, they often say things like, ‚Äúyou want it too much‚Äù, ‚Äújust live your life and it‚Äôll happen‚Äù, or my favorite, ‚Äústop looking and you‚Äôll find it‚Äù. They also push the idea that confidence and a good personality is the most important quality a man can have.

Now it‚Äôs not like this stuff is wrong. It‚Äôs just misunderstood by men.

First with confidence and personality . When women say things like this, I think I‚Äôm their mind they‚Äôre picturing a guy they would already be physically attracted to, but  not attractive enough for them to overlook a bad personality or lack of confidence. So in their mind for this theoretical guy to get a date with them, he‚Äôd just need to be confident. Man hear this as that if an ugly man is confident and has a good personality he can get any girl. Which is obviously not true.

When women give the advice to stop looking or that it‚Äôll come when you least expect it or stop trying to find it, I think this is more a misunderstanding of how men have to date. Man cannot simply just wait. Men have to hunt or they will find no food. Women are hunted. A Hunter will come find them eventually if they stop looking so hard. This will never be the case for men, unless they‚Äôre very attractive. If an average or Belle looking man tried this strategy it would lead to him being single for years to come.

I think because of these misunderstandings, both genders find themselves frustrated with each other. If we all try to place ourselves in others shoes, there‚Äôd be less frustration and anger.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ql3zp1/i_think_i_understand_where_the_misunderstanding/

24,ql43li,1635859359,Should I allow things to fizzle out or tell him I‚Äôm no longer interested?,"Hi all!  Quick question, I went on a date with someone that went really well, but I‚Äôm no longer interested in pursuing the relationship (we both expressed that we were dating with an intent for a serious relationship).  


He seems too busy for a relationship right now since he‚Äôs currently in school pursuing a demanding career.  From what I gathered so far, he‚Äôs the type of person that neglects his friendships and hobbies to fully focus on his schooling/career.  This isn‚Äôt an assumption, he specifically told me he doesn‚Äôt have time for friends and won‚Äôt participate in some hobbies since he studies all the time.  While I respected his obvious commitment and dedication to his studies/career, this was a red flag for me.  Again, I think it‚Äôs very important for a person to be dedicated to what they do, but this made me fear that he would not be able to give me the quality time and communication I need in a relationship.


He never texts me and I always initiate conversation.  I canceled our ‚Äúsecond date‚Äù on the day of because I was exhausted from traveling and I didn‚Äôt say anything about rescheduling.  Part of the reason I canceled was because he hadn‚Äôt talked to me at all in the week leading up to the date and didn‚Äôt give me any details/plan for the date.  In his last message to me he told me he had a very busy week and he hoped I had a good week, he wasn‚Äôt offended that I canceled.  He hasn‚Äôt attempted to reach out since.


In this situation, do you think I need to reach out to him and tell him this isn‚Äôt going to work out?  He‚Äôs not even talking to me anyways so he might have also lost interest on top of being busy.  I was planning on being upfront with him if he messages me again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ql43li/should_i_allow_things_to_fizzle_out_or_tell_him/

26,ql4p2m,1635861156,I dont know where it stands now,"Tltr; i told my crush how i felt , she didnt give a certain response but then showed me the harshest no ever and as i was about to move on she told me that it wasnt a no but she needed to process feelings from a previous relationship.

Last week i (m21) told my neighbor/closest friend (f21) that i had feelings for her and that i'd like to give it a shot and go out with her , i kinda said it because we were gonna go to a halloween party the day after and didnt wanna say something while drunk.

The response from her at the start was shocked face but then she started talking how she noticed stuff from me and that she thought about me before bur didnt make a move cuz we both live in a students dorm and didnt want it to be weird if it doesnt work out but she also said that she is also recovering from a FWB situation that ended last month and she is still attached to the person and overall with a bunch of other said stuff that were clueing to a positive answer afrer i told her that i didnt wanna put her on the spot and that she doesnt have to give an answer now and so the subject changed.

Fast forward to halloween night me and her we wanred to go out chec some partys so we go to party no.1 and the host there was kind of super extrovert and took shots with us and spoke but then he takes me aside and asks me hey are u with her? Im like its complicated and his reponse was ""dont worry by tonight u will kiss her"" didnt think much of that and afrer a few mins i saw her and him talking and me not knowing anyone at the party i went there and thats when they stopped and the guy whispered in my ear ""dont worry bro im wingmanning u and talking u up just give us a minute"" i got pushed off and i didnt feel comfortable with that.

Few mins later she comes to me and says how that guy was being weird telling her to go find a guy to kiss tonight but also flirting with her adn stuff , so after that she was drunk and we started dancing. And as we are dancing she turned her back to me and didnt want to dance with me or anything (which is something she didnt do before) and when she saw rhe host she went to him but he pushed her back to me and it was like that till we got bored and decided to go to another party , at that point i was starting to get hurt just cuz of how she treated me and how she went to that guy who she barly knows

We grabbed someone we met at party no.1 and went togather all 3 to party no.2 in a club and so now its me her and another girl , nothing much happened in the club some guys tried hittimg on her but she wasnt responsive to them and one guy tried getting really close to her but u pushed him off and she thanked me for that but 5 mins later she felt uncomfortable and wanted to leave so we left and as we wanted to go home i saw a friend of mine and he invited us back to his place and thats when all of this started going dark 

At his place the 4 of us drank some more but then she started openning up about her FWB and how she was hurt and she wishes she can find someone who takes care of her and is there for her , and in my mind im just so sad cuz im thinking hey that is me 24 hours ago i told u that i can be this person for you and so i got mad drank some more and somehow idk why ended up kissing the random girl from party 1 one kiss , that somehow transpired into all of us sitting on the couch and thats when she (my crush) who is super drunk starts complimenting the girl and ended up kissing her right infront of me andd then the turns around and kisses my friend , as much as i was shocked i was so hurt by what she said earlier than the scar she opened didnt hurt further. Later thay night me and the random girl we went to bed we didnt do anything just cuddled and her and my friend were in the kitchen im guessing they made out abit more and talked

I want to note out thay my friend knew about my feelings towards her and told me he is sorry a million times but i was so mad i didnt care.

Next morning we all go home and i start realizing that halloween night was the worst way possible anyone can ever say no to someone i was super hurt but i still felt like okay i must move on and i started to , me and my friend we talked it out he said he was sorry and me wanting to move on said idc what u do with her just be careful and dont get hurt.

One day later despite me talking to her normally she felt i was hurt and wanted to talk to me about that night and so she started by saying how im unfair when i used to ignore here and be mad at her for previous stuff (she is refering to when i found out about her FWB and that it was with one of my close friends) . Thats when i told her im not mad at her but i want to move on and i explained to her halloween night from my prespective , after some silence i was just like why couldnt u just say no to me before thay why did u have to show it to ne lie that even if u were drunk.

Her response was ""i didnt want to say no to us bejng a thing and i still dont but i dont wanna go into something while im still recovering from the FWB thing , halloween night was crazy i was drunk and i should have never done that with that girl or ur friend or the host at the first party"" we ended up talkinh it out and the current situation stands in 

me still trying to move on but also not knowing what she thinks.

My friend wanting to be a rebound to her and wanting my premission and me telling him i need timr to get over her then idc

That random girl well we didjt talk after and she doesnt play a big role in the story except me and her kissing once


What do you think i should do , i had feelings for this girl for months and i care so much about her , she says she wanted to process her feelings from her last FWB but then she does stuff that hurt me at halloween night so bad and after that she says she shouldnt have done that and she still doesnt wanna say no to us being a thing but she needs time to get over the FWB

29,ql4rbx,1635861342,Best first date(s)?,"I‚Äôm in something perfect for me currently (met through Tinder), and while our first date was great in the fact that we hit it off so well that we ended up talking for hours, the initial date wasn‚Äôt ultra exciting/movie moment magical except I remember seeing him and my innards sort of melted from instant attraction of this 6‚Äô4, brown-eyed, brown-hair, bearded geeky god with a smile and laugh that just lit everything up. 

we see a lot of worst first dates (I love those, all the drama including for mine which was shite at the time!) but what was your BEST first date?

I‚Äôll go first! I did Tinder for a long time and had done everything from laser tag to paint ball to dining at a fancy sky scraper restaurant‚Ä¶ even once a hot air balloon first date, but at some point I only did coffee dates (after really bad experiences on first meeting that ended up being the worst date so I wanted to be sure there was never a historical repeat).

I decided ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù after initially matching on an app and chit-chatting for a very short time so our mind didn‚Äôt form an inaccurate version of someone before we met, is the perfect meetup for OLD. 

Basically I could figure out if there‚Äôs an attraction whilst sober and have a quick and easy out if in person doesn‚Äôt align with digital version. 15 min with someone I‚Äôm not into (or who perhaps isn‚Äôt into me) is more than enough time.

So I met up with this guy fairly early in the day for coffee at this local artsy coffee house I hadn‚Äôt ever been to. He wasn‚Äôt super attractive or anything, he had braces, dark eyes and dark hair (like I like it) and a nice smile even with braces‚Ä¶ pretty instantly we vibed and had great banter. He was relaxed and not hyper (hyper guys on first date = üö©for me). He was super intelligent &amp; actually nice, which is just the most sexy thing a guy can be.

So we talked for several hours and it was great‚Ä¶ I thought we were wrapping things up and then he was like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôre you doing for rest of day?‚Äù‚Ä¶ I told him I didn‚Äôt really have any solid plans so he asked ‚Äúhow do you feel about going on a road trip?‚Äù‚Ä¶ we had been talking about places I hadn‚Äôt been to yet since moving to this city and on the list was this quaint mountain town‚Ä¶. So I was like sure! It was several hours away, we jumped in his car and took off. He was so chill I didn‚Äôt have any reservations about going.

We talked the entire time we are driving there and then walk around this quaint-somewhat-tacky üòÖ mountain town. We hold hands, explore artsy trinket shops, eat at this cute restaurant and as the sun is setting we are near the mountain summit and he kisses me while my innards danced and it was cinematic.

We drove back to my car that night and while our second date things were revealed that were dealbreakers for me, I‚Äôll always cherish that first experience with him even though I forgot his name üòÇ

 few months ago (29m)someone I‚Äôve(24f) low key been into for awhile gave me their number, without me having to ask or anything.

I've been seeing a guy for about three months. It's been casual, we've had no discussions about exclusivity and nothing sexual (We both wanted to go slow, previous bad experiences and all that).

He's an awesome person, there's just not going to be a future for us and I am no longer in a state where I have the energy or desire to continue dating anyone for the time being.

With all that said, would it be inappropriate to explain this over text? I know text in general is not as taboo now as it was years ago and it's not a serious relationship by any means. If in person, how would be the best way to do it?? I don't want to have this talk in public and I also don't want to invite him over or go to his place just to immediately be like 'this isn't for me, bye!', or do it after a date or after hanging out for a couple hours.

Note: When I say exclusive FBW, I don't mean those who only see their FWB for like an hour once a week or occasionally and don't have contact till then.

But, I've been ghosted.

I could fret and micro-analyze every text I sent and mentally review every mistake I made, but to be honest, I don't think I did anything wrong. She just didn't seem to like me all that much. She seemed distant, not wanting to text much, didn't like physical touch like holding hands, didn't spend a whole lot time together, didn't go to either of our houses to spend time privately. I was almost on my way out anyways because I really need quality time with someone to feel like I'm in a relationship and I wasn't getting it. I guess she beat me to the punch though.

The good news is - I'm not blaming myself and I'm not wallowing in self-pity or remorse.

The bad news is - the search starts all over.

It's a great town and I love it, and it's led me to be very creative with my sex/dating life. I'm almost going fast with certain girls and slower with some girls since it follows a vibe. Basically I get around a little haha.

Anyways a few of this girls really catch my eye (literally you'll see haha), and I'd like to share with y'all how I'm feeling with this. It's been a. Very comfortable thing for me and I'd like to share my findings with my situation to help y'all struggling out there.

Actually I'd like a discussion with this one.

So we had a really long ""Halloweekend"", as a Communication major, my fucking weekend starts at 5 on Wednesday, I live the free time I've set up.

Anyways I was going to get a munchie (I smoke a lot of pot, it centers me), and these girls (Both F 18) (who one lives down the hall from me), passed me in the stairwell. Well I can tell her friend was taken, but this girl (F 18) has the smokiest 'fuck me' eyes I've ever seen. Really caught me eye (see I told you it'd come through).

We were chatting up for a few and I made a real smooth move with her phone (made sure it was ok for here to add me on sc) and went for a kiss. 

GOT FUCKING COCKBLOCKED. (thanks roommate ((M 18 or 7 I can't tell) you're a homie üò¨üôÑüôÑüôÑ)

But since neither of us were sober it was honestly a blessing... So I texted her, ""hey if you're around this side of campus a lot, hmu I'm down to chill with you, just text me when you're sober ;)"" (paraphrasing but this is the jist)

Anyways she bites and sends a nice reply about how she's very much interested. Anyways, my problem is this:

I really like this girl, but I don't want anything serious right now bc I'm in a heavy way (in life's scheme, I'm doing amazing, kinda wanna live like this for a while. 

So, What I WANT to do, is hookup or go out together and see where it takes me. HOWEVER I am really not trying to catch feels since she's a fun person, and I don't want anything serious. She seems very much my type of girl and I think she's v interested in me. She's just home this week, so I've got some time to strategize.

However, a while ago i started to feel emotionally closed off towards him. My therapist and i established that it's because of a fear of commitment. The feeling passed and i was head over heels again for a while, but now the anxiety has returned.

I just want to know if anyone recognizes this feeling, because it feels so different from anything else i read/hear about fear of commitment.

I know i love him and i know i have an incredibly healthy relationship with him, but i can't seem to connect with him emotionally. Nothing has changed in our relationship, so i know the problem lies with me. I feel so so guilty all the time, because i want to be able to give him as much love as he gives me. But for some reason i just cant. At the same time I want some space, but i'm scared of him leaving. i'm so so conflicted. All i know is, i don't want to break up with him. A relationship like we have, doesn't come along very often. Yet i feel so axious about our relationship.

And i think that might be the cause of my anxiety. My ex and i had a very toxic relationship, with extremely high highs and extremely low lows. So i think i'm just not used to being in such a healthy relationship and my body is in fight or flight mode.

I feel like everything i hear or read about fear of commitment is running away and dumping your s/o and both ending up getting hurt. overall really toxic behaviour, but i don't relate to that. I want to get through this, because i know how good this relationship is for me.

51,ql6qvn,1635866976,Dating as a survivor,"TW: childhood sexual/physical abuse

I have already posted this in other related subreddits, but thought it would be interesting to get some advice on here. For some more context, I (25) am a gay guy though not sure if that makes any difference to the potential advice I may get.

As a childhood survivor of sexual and physical abuse, I am at point in my mid twenties that after years of intensive therapy, I have developed a more concrete idea of what I want from life. I feel even more ready to settle down and have a relationship.

That said, I have been in two previous relationships including 4 serious dating situations, one which ended recently after 5 months. I still attend therapy regularly and because of my recent break up, I have been analyzing things even more carefully. 

Ultimately, my last dating situation made my realize more than any other time before how much of the dynamics of my childhood trauma has seeped into my dating life. 

For context, I was abused for a summer at age 8 by a much older relative. At age 5 and 6 I was also physically abused by an aunt. Both accounts were quite graphic and severely changed me. 

That said, according to my therapist, it seems that the dynamics and feelings I had of being neglected and invisible during my abuse and the aftermath of growing up, continue to show up in my romantic life.

It is frustrating since my family and friends know about what I went through since I told them a few years ago. They have been supportive and caring. Recently, my older sister mentioned how there seems to be a disconnect in my regular life and romantic life. In the former, I am confident, know what I want and who I am, and can stand up for myself; however in the latter, it feels like all of that is thrown out the window

I especially have come to terms that sometimes it is easier to assume what my partner can‚Äôt and can do instead of asking them for the things I deserve. I have also come to terms that I do deserve more but I get scared to ask these things of my partners with the risk of getting disappointed. 

That said, I wanted to know how my fellow survivors deal with these kinds of dynamics and ultimately finding love. It feels like such an already impossible task. I want to be able to communicate to my partners what I deserve, and when I say deserve I am talking about the things I am willing and capable of doing. I don‚Äôt ask of things that are superficial, yet it seems it takes a long time for me to accept my partners for who they are and are not. I know this does not make them inherently bad, I just want to be able to get to this point quickly so as to identify who is willing to give me what I deserve‚Ä¶",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ql6qvn/dating_as_a_survivor/

I said that sounds good, and gave her my number. She texted me soon after saying its her etc.

Hey everyone. So I‚Äôm not a total noob to dating in my life I‚Äôve had one relationship that lasted just under a year in 2020. Beyond that 8 month period of being in love and being dumped, dating has been a dumpster fire for me.

I‚Äôve been getting a number of connections and dates online. Many times it seems to go well via text and phone call but then when we meet up in person they end up ghosting me after. That is if thet don‚Äôt ghost me before the meet up.

Background on me, I‚Äôm gainfully employed with a number of side hustles in events and I would say I‚Äôm a 5.5/6 out of 10 in the looks department being bald but in decent physical shape. 

I‚Äôm also an extreme extrovert and an open book. What people find to be a great asset I wonder now if it works to my detriment. I tend to be an open book and befriend people very easily and I‚Äôm loud and a joker but I wonder if I‚Äôm giving too much away too early and they get sick of me too quickly ? One of my friends have lovingly referred to me as having puppy dog energy lol

The strategy I‚Äôve been planning on using once I realized guys care about body count is to just keep it private, but I don‚Äôt think either of us would hypothetically be better off for that so I think I‚Äôm gonna have to tell the next man I date it all

I wouldn‚Äôt mind it if the next guy I sleep with is my husband but does that mean I have to wait a few years for my history to be further behind me in order to be seen as cute / innocent / valuable for a long term partnership? Is this a REAL concern for men looking to date and if so how do I counter it?

We both expressed that we weren't looking for anything serious before we both went off to college but still had an amazing time and talked and talked for hours post movie date. Nothing really came of the date due to covid and we spent a couple weeks talking a bit but it dwindled out where I eventually un-added him from my snapchat. Fast forward almost a whole crazy year he went out of his way to find my socials again and reach out (march2021). I was surprised he still wanted to talk to me especially because we only met once prior. We began going on dates here and there and he made it a point to tell me that he was a different person from the one he was before (don't know what he was implying). We began actively hanging out but never put an official label on anything. We did a lot of couple activities on top of hooking up. I even made the drive to see him twice at college when I was doing college classes from home from covid and he wanted to see me. We spent the whole summer together. He even brought me to meet some of his friends (which were two other couples) where we spent the night there and had a good time. Summer came to a close and this left the question of what would happen when I went away to school finally. He was coming up with ideas on how to see each other and was looking up distances between our two schools and how long drives would be to see each other. This really began to confuse me because we never talked about what we were and to most of my friends on the outside it looked like we were just ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù. We both went to school and still talk here and there. He continually talks to me and tells me how he can't wait to see me again or how he misses me. I would be lying if I said I wasn't still on tinder but mainly just looking for a dealer. I have gone on a few dates/ meet ups since being at school. But I have this overarching feeling of cheating. I know I am not and we are not official and that I have no idea what he is doing at school right now. I am just worried about hurting feelings. Even though we are not official it has been a significant amount of time where I need to address the situation. I just hate the idea of putting a damper on holidays and home visits and the talk to end things. I have never been in a relationship before so I especially don't even know where to start on ending things with him. Am I blowing this up way too much??

So I have met my first serious boyfriend when I was 18. He was not a king of romance but he have been trying to learn.  He would ask me out on dates and give me some little gifts time after time. Ok, I fell in love! I started feeling very passionate around him which I have never felt before. But I was scared about our first time. And I decided to tell this to him. I told him I was never with a man before and that I am scared of pain. He told me that he started dating me for one reason that I have never been with anyone before and he was ready for this. To be honest that sounded a bit weird. So he offered me to drink some beer and then try. When I relax. I did not relax even a bit after that beer. But I knew it was time, otherwise I will never be ready. 

And it happened...

For me it was nothing but pain. I have heard that it usually how it is for all girls. For him it was ‚Ä¶.disappointing‚Ä¶. For some reason. After he finished he felt angry. I did not understand why. I asked him what happened. He said that I lied about him being my first. although I did not lie. I asked him what makes him think I lied. He said that I had ‚Äúsome moves‚Äù. I mean what?? ‚ÄùSome moves‚Äù??? I had no idea what I had to do and I was just dealing with lots of pain. I told him that I had no moves and what about blood and pain I had.

80,ql9ko5,1635874571,"First time hanging out, not REALLY a date if you ask me, but it could be seen as one‚Ä¶ How much is too much?","Some backstory: 
I‚Äôve been getting coffee at this gas station almost every morning for a few months now and this girl works there two nights of the week. I‚Äôve struck up conversations with her almost every time, and they‚Äôve all ended quite well, she‚Äôs fun to talk to. 
Well, I asked her this morning if she‚Äôd be interested in going fishing with me on one of our mutual days off, and she seemed excited about it, and said it sounded like fun. Then I got her number and after I left, texted with her for a few mins about fishing. 

Now my minor dilemma is what else I could do when we‚Äôre fishing. Like, what I‚Äôve got stuck in my head the most is if I brought lunch or lunch makings, like an unopened loaf of bread and some store bought egg salad for egg salad sandwiches (I say store bought because I make way better than that myself, I just don‚Äôt know what people think about eating food made my someone they don‚Äôt know). 
But THAT really turns it into a date if you ask me, and I never used the word ‚Äúdate‚Äù with her, just asked if she‚Äôd like to go fishing with me. If she sees it as a date on the other hand, I‚Äôd like to at least take care of whatever lunch we have together, on top of hopefully surprising her with it. The other problem with that is if she‚Äôs allergic to eggs or something, it wouldn‚Äôt go so well. 

I‚Äôm an over-thinker, I know. I‚Äôm more inclined not to do anything I didn‚Äôt say I was going to do, and be as predictable as possible before really knowing anything about each other.  But I also want to meet expectations because I can.

&amp;#x200B;

I matched on tinder with this girl (20M) and we talked for a month before meeting (this meeting was two weeks ago). She was always saying how I was an exception to other guys etc etc. How she didn't meet quickly but she was happy I did not push her to meet. The conversation was initiated 50-50. Flirting was on both ends. We met at my place, everything is lovey dovey, we talked, kissed, had sex, slept together, cuddled together, had breakfast together etc. We both expressed our desire to see each other more.

&amp;#x200B;

The week afterwards we met two times more, although shortly and outside, and walk hand in hand, kiss and hug almost like a couple. During the week we also videocalled in the evenings to work on our own projects together. We talk about how everything is so amazing and we agree that we are going to start 'dating'.   
We were supposed to meet yesterday and have another date night, however this weekend something at home happened and she couldn't come anymore. Over the weekend she became colder and we don't talk a lot anymore. The flirting is absent, she doesn't respond to my attempts to rekindle the flame. I don't even know what the vibe will be if we meet again.   


I get that a weekend is too early to decide but this exact thing has happened to me before a year earlier and it took me a year to get over it too. It's just so unlike me that I can't wrap my head around it. Once i express a desire to explore a connection I do it and if it's not what i want i communicate that. It just sucks that people i feel enough connection with to continue dating them are so few and far in between. Oh well, good gym motivation i guess..

85,qla1eb,1635875811,"Whats the general attitude toward/experience of people who don't have the standard, happily married parents?","So, I've always heard, as I'm sure many of you have as well, that someone without the traditional happily married parents can be judged a bit harshly. Many times I've heard guys I know refer to girls with no dad as having ""daddy issues"" despite barely knowing the girl in question. And many times I've heard girls I'm friends with use similar terminology to refer to guys who are in similar scenarios. 

I myself have been rejected on online dating, on the basis of, and I quote, ""mommy issues"" before the girl even got to know me. We spoke for less than an hour, mostly about basic, common stuff you'd start any conversation with. 

At some point, she asked about my family and I said moms not around but I got a great dad and I love my niece to death. When I naturally asked about her family next, she just said something like ""oof mommy issues"" and unmatched not long after.

So I guess what I'm asking is... are things like that normal? I mean is it really commonly seen as such a bad thing to have split up parents? What about people with older parents or recently divorced parents, where one or both parent(s) moves in with the kid? Is any such scenario with your family thats less than ideal going to be judged, or only some of them?

To sum it up, I'd basically restate the title: are people in perhaps non-traditional situations like this generally judged quite as bad as I've heard and seen? Or is my experience the uncommon one? 

Sometimes I think maybe I'm looking for an excuse not to try, something to rationalize not having to show or build up my low confidence and put myself out there. But from what I've seen I do have to wonder if people more experienced than me have seen the same things.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qla1eb/whats_the_general_attitude_towardexperience_of/
86,qla7q5,1635876269,Random periods of ignoring me,"Been seeing each other for about 2 months now, we get on really well and everything is progressing as you expect. Then just randomly periodically she completely blanks me for like 4 or 5 days, this is the 3rd time its happened now and she blames it on her long working hours but its obviously something else as theres no way someone can't spare 30 seconds to respond to a message. 

It's really annoying because each time I don't know where I stand when she blanks me, i've been sat here for 5 days of her ignoring me feeling like crap because I really want it to work with her but she just makes me doubt everything. 

It is actually quite hard for us to spend a ton of time together because our work schedules clash so I think she isn't replying to me because she knows she is gonna have to say that she has no time to meet but i've already told her that I completely understand this and it's all good, I just dont wanna be ignored.

Am i overreacting, do I need to just let things play out and hope in the future that this will not happen anymore? I would be heart broken if this didn't work out because even after such a short time she really does feel like the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. I messaged her today saying that I don't know if i've done something wrong and hence the silence but no reply. It's so annoying but I don't know if i'm overreacting.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qla7q5/random_periods_of_ignoring_me/
87,qla9u7,1635876423,How do I not screw this up (sorry for the sort of long story),"So my friend and his girlfriend had a mutual friend that has a crush on me and Halloween night we all went for a movie , so the first movie we sat on opposite rows but then we went and trick or treated for a little bit and there we walked together and shared a basket and all that. But anyways then we went back to my friends house and watched the conjuring and since we are both cowards decided to hold hands and she put her head on my shoulder and it was pretty magical. But anyways it‚Äôs been 2 days since that and we‚Äôve been talking over Snapchat and she‚Äôs been down for any plans but I‚Äôm still afraid that I‚Äôll turn her off over the phone like I read on here sometimes.

88,qlajqz,1635877160,Ego√Østical men in bed and performance pressure,"So all my life I thought that coming too fast, not figuring out where the G spot is and failing to satisfy a woman was an emasculating dishonor and that such an impotent man in bed would be the mockery of all. 

I spent years building up such performance pressure that I eventually had to overcome the mental barrier to be able to get hard, let alone have an orgasm. 

I assumed it was normal to want to be a good partner cause bad partners are so often mocked in popular culture. Turns out most of the women I've been with and gay friends too confirm that most men just think of their own pleasure first in bed. 

It's like we all say out loud we're great fucks but when it's time to showdown most of us will deflate.

89,qlaoub,1635877543,Being led on,"So I just had a streak of 3 or 4 women who would plant these ideas by careless whispers as they pass.. like would say extremely sexual things or say they cared without really saying it. Hard to explain but I would take it as signs they were interested and once I put time and effort into getting to know them I would ask if they would like to do something sometime and the answer was always no... It seems I am always being led on and not sure why. Usually the women turn me down just to seemingly throw themselves at the next guy that walks by... It's leading me to form really unhealthy opinions of women, and I don't want to think they do it because it makes them feel in control and powerful to play with the emotions of someone they manipulated into feeling something for in the first place but that's what I'm starting to think.

Recently reconnected with someone on Facebook is used to know peripherally years ago. We got talking and I invited her out for Halloween with some friends. She brought some friends too. I buy a round of shots for everyone to break the ice and one of her friends does as well. We're getting toasty. I didn't realize it until after but she always had the seat next to her open. I'm thinking maybe here friends were ""helping out"" ? Anyway, we're sitting on this couch at the bar and we're laughing lots of close face to face eye contact. It's not like we were blowing off the other people there though. The big thing for me was that she kept bumping up against/leaning into me. In my limited experience girls tend to like their personal space. It's funny my best friend is like go for it dude but I'm still not 100% sure she's into me. Anyway we went out for food after and then me and a friend of hers went back to her place to eat and she wanted to show me her cats.

That shared bond that is our heritage and country.

Would Americans view it like an arranged marriage or in a negative light? It‚Äôs not arranged by any means. It is facilitated by family as my family would reach out to families they know that have women my young that are younger and connect us. Her or I could say no. And it‚Äôs our decision. But family is guiding it; as we say marriage is between families not individuals in my culture. 

Am I abandoning my new found home country of America but still embracing what some may think is a backwards cultural practice? I‚Äôm not going to Eastern Europe or SE Asia for a mail orde le bride; I‚Äôm asking family to help me connect with a woman from back home that I left during a civil war and never returned.

98,qlbwxd,1635880826,Is she no longer interested?,"So here‚Äôs the deal: I (24 M) met a girl (21) at a bar in late June through a friend of a friend. A bunch of people showed up who neither of us knew so we wound up talking all night. Before she left, she asked for my number and then texted me when she got home. I eventually asked her out for a drink, it went well, and the second or third time we got drinks she said that she wasn‚Äôt looking for anything serious because she had gotten out of a 3 year relationship 3 months prior and they were very co dependent. I said I understood but we continued to talk and got drinks a few more times. We were both living with our parents at the time so neither of us could really invite the other inside. After getting drinks like 5 or 6 times over 2 months, I moved to the city and immediately invited her to stay over, an offer which she enthusiastically accepted. She works like 20 minutes from my apartment so she came over right after work, so at around 4pm, and we spent the rest of the night and following morning together. This was the beginning of September. Fast forward to now, she has come over almost every Friday after work, with us either making dinner, ordering takeout, or going out to dinner. When we‚Äôre together, she‚Äôs clearly very into me and obviously I‚Äôm very into her. We started to text almost every day. A few weeks ago, we were at dinner and she briefly mentioned a trip we could take together. She followed that up by saying she was going to two concerts the following weekend ‚Äúwith her friend who recently broke up with his girlfriend, so we‚Äôll see how he does.‚Äù Following that weekend, I‚Äôve been seeing her less frequently and she‚Äôs been kind of distant over text. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm inundating her with texts, as I want to give her space, seeing as things picked up pretty quickly. Plus, she has a lot going on in her life right now. I try not to let her lack of responsiveness bother me, as she is a genuinely nice person, but it does and causes me to overthink every little thing I send. Last Friday, she said she wasn‚Äôt free because she had therapy and a family commitment that night. Saturday, she said she was ‚Äúmaking dinner with a friend and watching some movies.‚Äù Sounded like a date to me, but whatever. Today, I asked if she‚Äôd be around anytime soon and she said she won‚Äôt be around this Friday because her therapist forgot to pencil her in for last Friday so they had to reschedule for this Friday so she‚Äôs not sure when she‚Äôll be free. I mentioned last week that I wouldn‚Äôt be around this Friday so I replied by saying I was actually referring to Saturday or next weekend. She‚Äôs a very nice person and seems like the kind of person who‚Äôd be direct instead of just slowly fade away. Still, I can‚Äôt help but think that she is either losing interest or I‚Äôm doing too much.

We never discussed exclusivity so I‚Äôve gone on some dates with other people but I find myself thinking about her a lot. So, any suggestions on how I should move forward? Has she simply lost interest?

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qlbwxd/is_she_no_longer_interested/
