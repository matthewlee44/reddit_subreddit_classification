Hey helpful folks of the internet.

I've known this friend of mine (20,F) since close to 2.5 years, we've meet online via Instagram and I've been pretty close to her.

I was confused about what I felt, but I'm confident that I like her. We share the same music, movies and series tastes as well.

We don't meet frequently, but we chat every day, across platforms.

I've been wondering how should I take it forward, I'm a person very good at concealling my feelings, and don't know what she feels. Should I even shoot my shot?

If it's helps, we always talk about how single both of us are, and whenever I ask should I help find her someone, or ask her to find me someone, she doesn't respond at all to the question.

So I was supposed to meet up the guy for a dinner(second date). I met him via OLD. Coincidentally (unbelievably) I also lost my wallet today and told him about it. At first he said he’s okay to foot my bill and later changes the tune to, “if I want to chat more with you and stay at the restaurant after the dinner, I won’t be able to afford all the drinks so why don’t we meet tomorrow for coffee and walk our dogs. I am actually waiting for my new credit card to show up in the mail lol” 

I knew I earn more than him but this… I am so annoyed. I don’t want to be with someone who can’t treat me at one off situations. Is this how life would look like if one day I decide to not spend my own money with this guy??

About an hour after I left, he texted to see if I got home ok and told me he'd like to see me again. I said that I would too and we texted a bit more etc. During the date, he told me his last name, as did I. Well, obviously, I looked him up on Facebook. Nothing shocking, didn't find anything wrong. He had told me that he was separated about three months from his wife, and they had separated amicably and still got along well and co-parented their children. So it didn't surprise me to see photos of them together from last year.

What concerns me is that today, I searched his Facebook and can't find it anymore. I had someone else check too, just out of curiosity, and it just no longer comes up at all.

It can be one thing or everything just as long as it is something positive about you.
I believe that when you start saying the things you like about you it can really help you mentally and really improve your mental health overall and make dating a little easier and as a bonus you could really help someone who is going through a tough time right now with how the see themselves and really make a difference for them and help them get through this tough time and really improve their life for the better.

Few months ago I dated a guy and we had a great time, unfortunately it fizzled out because he was ‘busy with work’ and I just let it go as well.

We talked a bit and he said he was in a train on the way home from his friend and could stop at my place. A bit confused, I said I’m not looking for a hook up so he can forget about that. He reassured me that it was not the case and he just wanted to see me. So we did, had a fun conversation for a while and was getting late so agreed to sleep. 

He gave me some kisses and cuddles, I told him I was being careful and didn’t want to go further than that (he did tried a bit). He respected that and went to sleep. In the morning we chatted in bed, we talked about how we didn’t communicate well when things ended months ago and I was actually quite hurt about it. He apologized, but said I need to communicate that better as he thought I was done with him too. We had an relaxed morning, he didn’t kissed or hugged and just talked. When we said our goodbyes, we thanked each other and said it was good to them again. And now, I’m just very confused.. No idea what just happened and how (or if) we go further. It felt way too soon to kiss him or be intimate (although we have been before of course) but I did said to him I enjoyed him being here etc. My wall is so high up, as I was quite emotional for long time when things ended.

I have been single for 4 years as I was working on healing and personal development. I’ve come very far and I felt like I could venture into the dating scene again. 

She got me to open up more and I found myself laughing and smiling more than usual. She hit me up first, btw. We connected so much as we’re from similar backgrounds and our culture is also quite the same. She used to flirt with me a lot and I used to do so, too. We spoke on the phone and she used to tell me how she misses me when I was busy and that she looks forward to seeing me soon. Double texting. She always used to message me saying she wants cuddles.

We met up before New Years and it was nice. We flirted during our dinner and she complimented me a lot as did I. I really wanted to kiss her but I’m nervous with initiating things. We hugged and said bye. 

When she got home, she texted me that she really enjoyed spending time with me. She became busy with exams for a few days but texted me that she can’t wait to talk to me soon when she’s free. 

Well, it’s been almost two weeks and she has barely said anything. I see her posting on social media and she outright ignores my messages (I message her only when she responds to an earlier conversation). The responses are unbothered and monotonous. 

I figured it’s best to let it go so I deleted her number and she hasn’t messaged me at all since. I’m working on getting over it because I really go by the “if they wanted to they would”.

Then we have an exam right? So we texting about study then she says come over let’s study together.. Me being from male species long before being a student, went for sure not discarding sex completely but honestly hoping to study… 

I am there, we talk a little, eat, smoke then start studying but both feel sleepy, so we decided to take a nap then continue.. we both sleep on our side of the couch then I move next to her.. after a while she hugs me then we cuddle for a complete hour.. so warm, sweet and all but now she says we should start studying, absolutely logical, we should but if the little problem here - which if you can’t see it’s bec you’re more likely from female species- .. I am freaking CONFUSED.. 
I’ve never been around a girl so long, alone in such a close setting and not at least fool around for a little while and she is a little hotter than I am but not totally out of my league..

Anyway we get up, we study, talk, laugh, good times but it gets a little late for me to go back, so she asks me to sleep on the couch; OUCH. 

It’s fine, I play cool all night but honestly my mind is really confused and has a lot of thoughts.. and feeling a bit unwanted…

Three times now, guys whom I thought were actually very fun/interesting have asked for my snapchat. I tell them all something like “my username is ___ but I don’t use it too often.” because it’s the truth. but then immediately after that I’m ghosted lol. 

hurts my feelings cause we basically go from talking everyday/ every other day to no communication at all. 

Is this just one of the pitfalls of internet dating? Is it something I may have said? Or.. is it an elaborate scheme to blow my

I'm 26 M.

I had a very poor dating (or social) life in general throughout all my life.  I have participated in a group therapy for a few months few years back (I took a gap year at university to attend there), didn't have money (and I felt like I didn't have time, I guess) to attend a one on one therapy afterwards.  I've been attending a one on one therapy since September last year (although not weekly, due to reasons).  This is just to address that I'm a bit troubled individual.

Few years back (like 4) I've met the girl that I really liked at the first sight, I rarely do meet people I like from the start (should I start putting more effort, if chemistry isn't immediate? I really don't know...).  I have worked hard during that period and eventually my self esteem was pretty high, we have become a very close friends. 

Sadly, this period of becoming very very close friends happened right before strike of COVID.  

I am, I guess, rather sensitive individual, and my mental health lost with the struggles caused by COVID:

1) I had many problems with jobs (I had 3 jobs from March to October of 2020, I also had an issue with one job prior, but there just my employer was quite ""unreasonable"" and I decided to leave), 

2) got plenty stressed by the landlord who had completely no compassion for my employment problems and the dropping rent rates, constantly harassing me with going to court,

3) I was still at a university, so it was also keeping me ""busy"".

I know that for someone people it will be nothing, but it was my first venture to become completely independent from my parents (I was already living alone for 1 year, but it was in a small apartment in my hometown presented by my parents during my gap year taken for therapy) where I would rent something by myself in another city, and it went absolutely horrible because I've been having issues from the day one.  It has really damaged by mental health (more) and my self esteem. 

On October 2020 I started my current job.  I really liked it... until I was moved to other department on Spring, which caused me a lot of stress, as it was completely other experience like working in another firm.  The frustration caused by this and finishing university was enormous.

Back to the girl - we had been dating although with many hiccups (my issues caused me to say many things that hurt the girl).  There had been many bad events, but we remained on and off.  Although, I guess it has to be pointed out, due to my no experience, despite us meeting for around a year, I wasn't really driving it anywhere.  It was cause some stuff she had told me made me a little more cautious that she would leave when I am at a low point in my life.  Although I really appreciated her friendship, I was very unavailable due to the all above stress and so had trouble taking the relationship further.  I have told it many people and they found it weird - I thought of her as my best friend, and while I was attracted to her, I didn't want to ""use her"" if I didn't feel like committing to something serious (she is also a virgin, 2 years younger) so I guess I made a mistake of not telling her exactly that, but rather just always stopped at cuddling. 

Well anyway, I eventually lost it and hurt the girl with many sharp words (it was one of many things obviously, but my frustration was at absolute peak, and that has really tipped the edge) and she decided to leave me in July 2021.  I was devastated because she was the closest person I've ever had and I had lost just when I graduated and was still stuck with my job.  

I had better and worse periods during this time but I'm still stuck in the loop of constantly analyzing what went wrong there.  I'm still having terrible mood swings.  For some reasons I did not decide to leave my current job then, but I'm looking to change it right now, because not much has changed (it still both boring and frustrating) and it gives me recalls why I'm lonely right now.

I'm trying to get myself out there, although I don't have many friends, and some of them are married or coupled, so it's getting harder and harder just to hang out.  And even if there is an opportunity I'm often struggling with the sadness caused by the separation with the girl what either makes me feel completely disconnected during a meeting or just skip it all together.  

Anyhow, I'm going to try meet some new people (I think I may have some opportunities to do that, if I try hard enough) during the following weeks and hopefully there will be a connection. 

**TLDR:** I know this is vague - I'm just pondering on what I should focus on or what I should do.  I'm definitely going to change my job, and if I don't find one very very soon I'll just start looking for it jobless.  What I am not certain about, considering how long ago already I had been dumped - should I still try healing on my own, focusing on hobbies of mine (nothing super interesting I guess, I just like video games and working out/running, although I have started programming few months back in my free time to possibly some day pursue a career change) or considering how long it's taking I should I really try to get myself out there to meet new people, not necessarily a new partner, just new connections to exchange thoughts with etc.  It's very hard, I really do not know - I'm worried that I'll scare any new people with my baggage that, while being a little less annoying, still cripples me from moving on.  Or maybe it's the first step that I need to take and I'm worrying too much?

I was confused about what I felt, but I'm confident that I like her. We share the same music, movies and series tastes as well.

We don't meet frequently, but we chat every day, across platforms.

I've been wondering how should I take it forward, I'm a person very good at concealling my feelings, and don't know what she feels. Should I even shoot my shot?

Since the world has changed signifcantly over just the past few decades with the advent of social media, dating apps, and poltical movements such as womens' rights, I feel like the world of dating and, by extension, the dating advice that is needed to venture this world have changed along with it.

The common dating advice I hear a lot now is: If you like a girl, ask her out. Have multiple options. If she doesn't like you back, move on.

I wonder: how would this advice have worked in longer periods of time? If I liked a girl in an earlier period of time, what advice would I have recieved in that time? How has dating advice evolved with the world of dating to the advice that I hear a lot today?

Let's say it's 1950s America and I liked a girl. How well would asking her out have worked in the 1950s? What dating advice would I have received in the 1950s?

Now let's say it's the 1800s when the Industrial Revolution had just begun. Let's say I liked a girl back then. Would asking her out have worked back then? What dating advice would I have recieved back then?

Now let's say I'm in Medival Europe and I like a girl. Would asking her out have worked back then? What dating advice would I have received?

Now let's say I'm in Ancient Egypt and I like a girl. Would asking her out have worked? What dating advice would I have received?

Now let's say it's a few hundred years from now and I like a girl. How much would the world of dating and dating apps have changed as the world changed with it? How would modern dating advice continue to evolve as the world of dating evolves with it? Would asking a girl out work in the future?

He basically travelled back a month ago to spend the holidays with his family, and surprisingly kept on requesting that thr two of us hang out (to the beach, watch a movie, cup of coffee, lunch.. etc) and became really attached to each other, (also sometimes it's him who payed the stuff for both of us). Thinking of it now, the time that we spent together felt like more than just ""hanging out"" to me, and I was okay with it and never asked him about it because he is known to be flirty and I assume I'm not his type to begin with.
Until the last time we hang out before he travels back, he gave me his personalised ring that he wore on daily basis for years as a gift to remember him by it, just incase it takes us years to meet up again.
I was already convinced that everything between us is platonic, until this ring made me so confused. I even started to compare how we used to talk in those two years ago vs now, and he is way more interactive, expressive and flirtatious than before.

Finding it incredibly difficult to bring up this topic naturally without it sounding forced or pushy.
I (20F) have been seeing a guy (25M) since late September roughly once a week/fortnight, so not too often but it’s been really consistent and it’s been going on for months now, and I feel as though I’ve grown closer to him in that time.

The issue is, neither of us have stated what we’re looking for. We met on Hinge, which is usually meant for relationships but that’s not always that case. I’ve been seeing other guys (dates, not sex) in the space of time I’ve known him because we haven’t made things exclusive.
I knew from the start I didn’t know what I was looking for so I didn’t have any hopes/expectations when we met. I was happy to have something casual or something that would develop into a relationship.

When we started going on dates, it was very relationshipy, as we would go out for drinks, hold hands and he made me a Spotify playlist because we share similar music tastes. Now I am fairly certain we have shifted into a fwb situation, as we don’t go out as often and just have sex after every date, and I’m fine with that. But lately we’ve been having late night deep conversations and I just feel so comfortable and open around him, unlike I’ve felt with any other guy. And he’s so caring and thoughtful and takes aftercare seriously and he listens to me when I don’t want to do something during sex. I never even felt this cared for when I was with my ex.

I just want to know where his head is at. I really don’t mind if we’re going to stay fwbs or if he wants something more (I’m fine with either) but it would just be nice to know so that I can choose how much time to invest in him and/or stop myself catching feelings in advance and also whether I should continue seeing other guys. So I’m not scared of the outcome of whether he wants a relationship or a fwb as I’m happy with either, I’m just worried of scaring him away by asking it.
I rarely take the initiative when dating guys as I’m incredibly shy, so lately I’ve just been hoping he’ll bring up the topic. But since he hasn’t after all this time then I’ll continue to assume it’s a fwb situation.

Tl,dr: I think I’m in a fwb situation but I don’t know what the other person thinks it is. There could be potential for a relationship but I’m fine with whatever.

After talking to my buddy about her I asked the bartender what she was drinking. So I walked up, gave her a drink and asked “what’s your name?” “Ashley” 
“would you be interested in exchanging numbers for a date?”
“Yeah, we can.”
She gave me her number, I sent her a text with my name.
“my name’s ***** by the way, I don’t think I said that.” 
“No” 
She checked that she got my text, she did.
she thanked me for the drink, I said you’re welcome “so I’ll call you this week.” 
“Yeah!”
and went back to my table.

I caught she was a bit of a country girl and kicked some ass on the country songs I do. I let her be for the rest of the night. 

I noticed she was leaving so I walked up and said “It was nice to meet you.”
Went in for the hand shake and she came in straight for a hug. She said in my ear “Just text me.”
“I will.”

Talked to my buddy about when I should text her, he said to text her that night. 
“It was nice to meet you. I get off work tomorrow around 6, I’ll text you then.” I thought it was a little redundant but he knows more than me.

So I'm a 25 year old guy who hasn't been in any kind of relationship with a women yet and I don't know where to start as the thought of going on dates and meeting new people is absolutely frightening. I'll give a little backstory about me:

I live in a shitty (non-western) country, not quite a 3rd world country, but still pretty shitty. I don't consider myself ugly (probably average looking, in fact I had a few girls in highschool express interest in me, but I wasn't interested in a relationship then), a little chubby (working on it as I go to the gym and lift frequently), don't have a car yet (but also working on it) and still live with my parents. The reason I live with my parents is because I used to work dead end/low paying jobs and if I rented my own place I'd be pretty much living in poverty. On the other side I got to save up a relatively big sum of money for someone my age in my country. Also I'm going to a coding bootcamp so by the summer I plan on moving out.

The reason I'm still a virgin is because of a condition I had that completely crushed my self esteem for the past 12 years, I couldn't do pretty much any social activities, go to the gym, go to the beach, etc. I won't go into depth on what I had, but long story short I had a surgery last year and my life and confident changed by 180 degrees, I feel like a brand new person that can enjoy all the things I mentioned above.  
Now the problem is I don't know where to start with dating and I feel like 25 is too old to be without any dating experience, I literally have ex classmates that are married and have children while I'm here with no experience. The thing that is scaring me about meeting people is that I'm an awkward guy, I often stumble in social situation due to stress and mess up my words by saying them too fast, I also think I'm pretty bland and uninteresting. Also literally have no pictures of me that I could use for dating apps as I've got no friends that could take my photos and my selfie game is weak af.  
I feel like exposure therapy works the best for me as I was literally afraid of the gym before I started going there and now after some time gym is like a second home. So I guess I have to accept that the first few dates will suck but I'll get better at it as the time goes on? I don't know, sorry for this big wall of text, I'd greatly appreciate any inputs or pointers on how should I dive into the dating pool.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1152491,public,self,"25M, kissless virgin, finally ready for a relationship and self improvement, but no idea where to start.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s4o8yb/25m_kissless_virgin_finally_ready_for_a/,no_ads,0.0,,,,

Context (of course, only from my perspective):
Guy and I who were getting along really well in conversation and getting to know each other. 
We have a conversation about emotional cheating. He’s saying he doesn’t believe in it and he hates it and thinks it’s controlling. I tell him well, these are peoples experiences and what they believe to be emotionally cheated. I realize late he’s asking if those things could make me feel emotionally cheated on, I tell him no. Hurt and ready to leave but not to the same pain as cheating. He’s decides we’re no longer learning about each other romantically, without telling me because he feels like I changed my answer. I tell him I misunderstood his question. He says that I brushed up against a boundary so his guard is up and he doesn’t have the energy to tell me what the boundary is. I give him some days. I reach out to explain again my perspective vs peoples experiences and the actual definitions of emotional cheating and apologize for the confusion.
We decide to be friends instead. Which was hurtful and confusing to me. Also I find out the boundary is that he feels like I was trying to gaslight him. This conversation was over text, so reviewable. 
I told him I needed some space (so I could let him go romantically and find peace). I told him what date I would be reaching out. He wants to fix whatever is causing me to need that space and gets frustrated. He also won’t allow me to call so we don’t have to argue over text.

He eventually says we can call. I keep trying to explain my perspective and how I was hurt. He tells me he feels he’s being patient and kind. He keeps asking questions about me, which I answer. He doesn’t answer those same questions because he doesn’t feel comfortable and doesn’t tell me what he thinks about my answers.
By the end of the conversation he told me it’s crazy how many red flags I have, while laughing. I said ouch okay, can you tell me what they are so I can work on them, even if this doesn’t work out? Or maybe you can share your understanding of me, so we can figure out if that’s what I was trying to communicate? He said he doesn’t feel safe in this space to.
He asks me if any of my past relationships felt safe to open up to me (one cheated and one was avoidant, they said so themselves). This felt like him playing on an insecurity? He said he’s trying to open up right now and I’m not letting him… I said when? If this whole time you were saying you don’t feel safe to?

Might be long, but appreciate any advice or thoughts on this.

So me and my friend went to dinner, just the two of us. We've gone out to eat in groups before but I was excited that it would just be us this time.

Anyway she had a cocktail and got a tiny bit tipsy and started saying a lot of stuff that was somewhat conflicting imo. And what's that saying, ""a drunk mind speaks a sober heart""?

For example, She said she got jealous when I was talking to this other girl at work. This kind of made me feel like she's actually interested in me and I told her she didn't have to get jealous cause I really like her the best.

She has gotten very touchy with me recently too, like hugs, playfully bumping into me, etc. but that night she said she gets flirty with me cause I'm ""an easy target"" and it helps her ego. That one kind of bugged me... Like wtf I thought we had a good back and forth only to find out it's just for her personal benefit and doesn't really mean anything? Also why would she get jealous if I was talking to another girl then?

In the moment I didn't ask for clarity and maybe I should have but her being tipsy idk?

I think if we get more alone time I might ask her what the deal really is cause I don't like wondering anymore.

If anyone here has some better suggestions on how to approach something like that that would be great, thanks!",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1152490,public,self,"I'm getting conflicting information, is she leading me on?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s4ol9z/im_getting_conflicting_information_is_she_leading/,no_ads,0.0,,,,

We knew each other but weren't friends until we exchanged numbers and started talking. We have become really close 

I have succeeded in hanging out with her a couple times. More recently we have started going to the gym together so I could show her some routines. We hang out at my place afterwards. We haven't been on a date 

My next step is to make a move, ask her out for an actual date, or just tell her how I feel. But she has said some things before that give me a little hesitation. 

Since we first started talking she has told me alot about why she is single. She doesn't seek out relationships despite getting alot of attention from guys. She is happy with being single. She also told me she is a virgin because all of her bad relationships in the past ended before it got to that point. That's also another important note: part of why she appears jaded is because she hasn't found anyone who understands her, and can't seem to find people who relate to her or appeal to her emotionally due to things that happened in her childhood involving abandonment and neglect. 

This all points to her being happy where she is at without a guy in the picture. But what confuses me is that she has told me explicitly that I have all those qualities that she has never found in a guy. She has told me that she believes I understand her, and have the emotional maturity to talk about those things with her. She has flat out told me she has never talked to someone who understands her like me and it makes her happy. 

So do I risk complicating a friendship where she feels safe around me by telling her how I feel or try to progress things? Something tells me that due to her reserved and highly protective nature she might turn and run the minute I let my guard down to her and share my feelings for her

However, I was going through a lot of pressure from school as I just started grad school and everything is so new and I was distressed about it, and I believed she knew it as I explicitly told her that. And I admitted that I might not invest much energy and thinking into this relationship. After three weeks, our relationship went south, she starts to complain that I no longer make surprises anyone, she felt she pays for everything (such as food, which is not really the case; We silently agree that we pay groceries by turns), and she said: ""if I knew you are this kind of person, I won't be together with you"". 

I was anxious and I started to ""fix"" myself by planning our dates, making surprises, and doing whatever I thought she might like. Then, she broke up with me by saying things like ""I think you lost yourself, and I no longer see any spotlights in you. Maybe we should not see each other. You know, maybe when you become a better person, I might just ask you out again"". I was speechless and didn't know how to respond. 

I have been questioning myself a lot these days. I started to learn more about psychology, e.g attachment theory, and I conjecture that she is avoidant style and I might be anxious. But still, when I am not busy with school and stuff, I still question myself.

My ex whom i dated LDR for 4 years moved in with another girl couple months after breakup. We were trying to be friends at that time (yeah right) and for the next 6-7 months, he would tell me all the time about how he doesn't love her and he's been upfront about his emotional unavailability, but she accepted the terms anyway (she's literally been paying his rent for god's sake). He even hooked up with another girl as an effort to break up, but later went back to her for comfort.

I, a huge dumbass struggling to move on, let him do this for some time, until I just couldn't take this BS anymore and finally blocked him. 

Fast forward couple months he texts me again with a new number, telling me that he's finally seeking therapy and he couldn't stop thinking about me all this time and he still loves me blah blah .... while he continues to live with tyat girl. 

At this point whatever feelings I had for this guy are GONE because I'm utterly disgusted by what he's doing to me and to her. Like... he's most definitely not over our relationship, he's clearly not treating this girl right and still has the balls to tell me he loves me???

When I said ""dude I moved on, it's time you do too.""  he went nuts and blocked me, dropping the cheesiest ex bf line (i.e. I will always love you.)

I have had conflict in my interpersonal life.

In the past, I have made some mistakes I have had to learn from.  This is including not only being emotionally abusive which came from a lack of introspection mixed with the deadly combo of toxic masculinity. I oozed it in my early twenties, and stopped the cyclical trauma to focus on myself to ensure I never hurt another person again.

In this time period, I have dated and have grown.  I have understood what I want, communicating, and taking care of myself.  The unfortunate part is that within this period, I was the victim of emotional and physical abuse, which pushed me to thinking that truly “hurt people hurt people.”

Fast forward to now, to which I am comfortable with my high school teaching, and my place in this world. I love my job and want to give others the support I never got in hopes to prevent not only these kids making similar mistakes I made when I was younger, but also teach them the discipline and structure of caring about others and being kind.  My routine has been focus on that, go home, and do the same thing the next day.  Then, spend time with loved ones in my free time.  It has been a good, consistent routine of being single and taking care of what I need to.  I also Have been single many months because the last person I saw was so toxic that I had to let it go.  Emotionally and physically reckless and abusive and I refused to let myself succumb to it. 

Now I have met someone that has captivated me. I have been back in the dating scene since October.  50+ matches and conversations on Hinge.  Dates fell flat, and I refused to kiss anyone or do anything with anyone I felt off about. So, I was ready to delete my apps. Then this woman matches me, and asks me out. And holy shit.  Immediate sparks. She is around my age (I’m about to be 31, and her 33).  She is intelligent, challenges me, and is everything I thought I’d never come across in my life again (last time I had this was many years ago, and I ruined it).  So, we have this incredible chemistry. She is communicative, well-read, working on a degree to move up in this world.  And now I’m excited to get to know her. Being around her is like being around an old friend.  We laugh. We are comfortable. We talk already like partners. We have also explored very intimately but haven’t had the complete package of sex, and probably won’t for a while (mutual decision). But now…

I’m worried. I’m worried about making similar mistakes as before, or looking at this from rose colored glasses.  I can see myself truly building something special.

I told her a lot of my feelings and I feel i overdid it with my emotions. The worst part about it was that i had lost a family member so I was depressed. I used to flirt a lot as a joke but it turned into something real for me. Lately I’ve been feeling like myself again. I really want to get back in touch with her but I put a lot of emotional baggage onto her. Is there a way to go about rekindling that old relationship before I had before I got depressed?
