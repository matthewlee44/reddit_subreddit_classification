But then we had serious talk and decided to break up(mostly from her side but I agreed because it was the right thing to do ) because she is planning on studying abroad and I have good and stable job in our hometown.

So we didn't want to prolong inevitable, she basically told me she didn't have planned to date anybody but I appeared and some things happened between us. And she was afraid that if we stay together she will fall in love with me more and not be able to leave me and go abroad.

Breakup was kinda weird since she is working with me so I insisted that we will meet like a week after break up and talk because I didnt want it to be weird between us in work (main reason was I saw her cry in job the next day we broke up because she wasnt handling it well) So we talked and agreed that we will stay friends and continue on meeting each other as friends.

So 2 months passed and things happened. Like all of sudden she sent me here cute photo when she was drinking with her friends. Then next days she was texting me how her day was and wishing me good night and so on. And basically we are texting every day and when we meet it's always great. Also I noticed that sometimes she is looking at me and smiling for no reason.

Also she didnt leave yet becaushe she has to end her study first, so she is here for another 4 months or so. 

And now the 2 months after the break up I realized I still miss her and have feelings towards her. So I am asking for advice if I should tell her how I feel about her or better keep it to myself. Because I feel like I am missing an opportunity when I dont say anything but on the other hand I dont want to ruin a friendship we currently have.

Basically, I am 33m and fairly attractive but have VERY limited dating experience. And hands-on sexual experience. I struggled with self-esteem and low confidence through my teen years and most of my 20s and had a lot of ""self-doubt,"" which obviously hindered my dating/sexual relationships. Anyways, I've worked hard on those and they are greatly improved.. 

I had my first real ""relationship"" with a girl 7 years younger than me for about a month last July. She was also my first sexual partner. All went pretty good for the most part, even the sex (I'm sure it wasn't all that spectacular for her, but she claimed it was lol.) I ended up calling it off because I saw no actual future with her and didn't want to lead her on. 

ANYWAYS... I want a relationship that - hopefully - could turn into marriage down the line. I'm not really looking for just hookups, though I also wouldn't turn it down, and I guess I'm kind of hesitant to get into a relationship due to my lack of experience in bed. What if we get along great, have a lot in common, etc... and then have sex and it's god awful? On paper, I know what to do but I don't know what I like in bed, if that makes sense. I also am worried about how long I last. Maybe the time I *think*  should last is skewed but, I get aroused somewhat easily and well... I don't feel like a minute or two is very long. I mean, I can last a loooonngg time on my own but it's different with someone else.

We met through a discord server dedicated to a hobby we both share, where he would later reach out to me over Instagram. We spent a lot of time talking after that, and became good friends before we started dating. 

Before our relationship, I never thought anything of him until he confessed to me and eventually asked me out. I was initially hesitant about this and suggested that he go to college first and gain more experience before we went through with a relationship, as a relationship with him had never crossed my mind and I was looking at what I thought were his best interests at the time.

After the many discussions we’ve had, he still insisted that a relationship with me was what he wanted, and with much consideration, I ended up caving in.

Ever since then, we’ve been in a relatively happy and healthy relationship together. We practice open communication, productive conflict resolution, are each other’s go-to person for emotional support and we put a lot of emphasis on consent and respecting each other’s boundaries (and to clarify, we are in a LDR and have not had any sexual exchanges, although legally the AOC is 16 in both of our states). 

His family and my family are aware of our relationship and they are all supportive of it, as we’ve both had a positive impact on each other’s lives and have had a lot of character growth being around each other.  

However, lately I’ve been seeing a lot of controversial opinions and commentary about the subject of age differences in relationships. I’ve come across several Tiktoks where people have voiced that they felt “icky” about anyone above the age of 18 dating anyone 16-17 years old, and now I can’t help but feel like I’m doing something morally wrong because I do understand where those individuals are coming from. 

When I was around my boyfriend’s age I was also in an age gap relationship, except it was with someone significantly older than me who was a groomer and was also manipulative/abusive (I was 16/17 while said person was 28-30 at the time). I would never want to put my boyfriend through what I had been through, so I have always put in a lot of effort to be mindful and vigilant about my actions around him.

Even though I try my best to be a healthy partner for my boyfriend, I’ve started to question myself as a person for dating him because of those commentaries. Just the thought of being labelled as a “groomer” or a “creep” for dating someone younger than me is eating me up inside, and I don’t know what to do with these feelings. Am I doing something wrong here?

I slept with this guy from Tinder. 2nd date, he was indirect but quite clear with his hints that he wanted sex, so did I.

I went to his place and we watched a movie and then had sex. Afterwards I stayed for the night, and we talked a lot during that night. I was thinking of him being a good FWB, but now I’m unsure.

One of his questions was “do you still like giving blowjobs?”, because I didn’t agree to give him one that evening, because he clearly wanted it unprotected. I didn’t ask, if he got tested, in the heat of the moment, because I know horny brain may decide to lie.

I explained to him that I don’t give blowjobs to just anybody because I fear STDs and STIs and don’t want them, I try to be careful. Then I asked him “are you always careful?”

He was like “Suree. I don’t want 7 STDs and my dick to fall off lol”

At this point, in my mine, he had an opportunity to make me comfortable to give head to him by explaining that he gets tested regularly or HAS been tested lately, but I didn’t hear none of that. It’s quite concerning cause I know he sleeps around a lot.

_If he would get tested actually_, why wouldn’t have he told me it at that point, given that I told him I’m super careful about safe sex? I assume that’s because he doesn’t get tested unless symptoms arise?

Also, I was the one who insisted on using a condom for PIV, it was my condom, and I doubt he had any. 

He also wanted to go down on me (unprotected) immediately without asking about anything about my sexual health etc. But I guess guys don’t?

This guy has told me he’s not looking for a relationship at the moment but he might be later. That was fine with me because I don’t want to rush into anything. But ever since then it felt like he wanted to do every “couple” activity imaginable. He took me to meet his parents, he took me to hang out with his friends, we went on a road trip together, he started talking about our future, we spend long weekends together, he even admitted to having strong feelings for me. Surprise surprise, now I’m attached, but I think if I asked he would still say he still isn’t ready for a relationship. On top of that, on the few days we aren’t together, his friend told me they go party and pick up girls to have one night stands with.

I saw him today after one of his party nights and he was as romantic as ever and brought up all the trips we’ll take together and all the things he wants us to do. He seemed genuine again. I tried to leave our date earlier than usual and he even begged me to stay. He even teared up a little.

So wtf is this? Is this guy just a god-tier player and that’s why I’m confused? Or is he a guy in denial about wanting a relationship? Does he have some other issue?

The messages got a bit well yeah. Oh also did i mention this was long distance? It was/is. Not sure what it is right now, though I have a good idea.

Anyways the last two days I noticed she got a bit cold. Less frequent messages, less enthusiastic messages and so on. I know people are busy in their time but she also said we should just keep talking and see where things go. Seems like just a couple days ago she was itching for something. Also I should add we started talking just as friends and things kinda turned into something more. Now it seems like it’s gone.

The answer is simple, yall are just bad at talking to women. Whether it be you want a relationship, or just sex, you still have to “pull” the woman. Like i said im M21, 6 ft, and id give myself maybe a 6? Just an average looking guy, and i used to have trouble with women in early highschool, but ever since then ive never had trouble with them. So im going to help you. First and foremost, make them laugh. That should be your #1 goal when talking to a woman. A funny man comes off as easy going, and likeable. First impressions are everything, and if you can make them laugh within the first couple minutes of meeting them, youre off to a good start. Second, stop being so scared, women are people too. The same way you would approach another dude, is the way you would approach a woman. Ik some people have anxiety, but unfortunately, it’s very easy to tell when someone is unconfident in themselves, so practice. Third, please do not be a creep when flirting. If you dont know how to flirt, complimenting them is a good way to start. And not “damn girl your ass looks fat”, mention their nails, hair, hell even their eyes. And lastly, and this is mostly for dating apps like tinder. For Women around my age, “hey” is not going to cut it. You are one of many, go learn some pickup lines, clever ones, funny ones, sweet ones. But like i said first impressions are everything. Side note: you are going to get rejected, it happens, but dont turn into an asshole because of it. Being disrespectful towards women is a sure fire way to make sure you dont get any. Now use these tips and go get you some. 

Tldr:if you struggle with women its because your approach is wrong.

Times go by (recently)- he started to call me this cute nickname and making flirty comments. He tells me I'm the first person to know anything he wants to post on social media and that I'm the person he asks for advices. 

Him knowing that I was coming to Country B for Christmas, he has asked me multiple times in the past few days (now that I'm in Country B) if I wanted to do something with him. 

When I told him that I prefer to see him in group, he doesn't seem to understand. He keeps commenting ""I won't bite you know, we can just go together"". I want to see him but in a group setting, however all my other friends that know him as well are out of country (Country B) or with family. 

Therefore, I'm in a situation where I don't know if it's a good idea to see him alone or not because I wouldn't want to cause a misunderstanding and him thinking it is a ""date"" when it isn't or wouldn't want to give him hope as I'm not interested.

Anyway, we were both at a party the other night and we dosed some MDMA with some other friends of mine that were there (safely, of course), and when we got home we were kind of still rolling and as she’s getting ready for bed we start talking about sexual fantasies. Just laid back talk and giggling about different stuff, and she then proceeds to ask if she can confess something. So I’m like yeah of course wtf go ahead blah blah blah. She then tells me her fantasy is: having me fuck her from behind / on top of her on a bed as she’s squirting and orgasming on the edge of the bed, while a young teen girl gets beat to death with a baseball bat on the floor in front of her with the girl’s blood continuously splattering on her. She claimed she’s had this specific fantasy for a really long time. And she said it like she meant it I could tell by her tone of voice. I even confirmed the next day if I had heard her correctly and she said yes like nothing. Mind you, she’s a perfectly stable person and an academically successful student and all of the above. She’s never done anything significantly violent in her life or anything like that as well. And she loves animals.

Last night we had dinner and had really intimate sex (turns out I was her first sexual partner that she has gone beyond 'fooling around with'). 

The previous woman I was seeing was so critical of me in so many ways, with persistent things like my quirky jokes and humour when we'd hang out. Even during sex (she usually focused on her own needs first, with mine as an afterthought, and was quick to criticise my efforts, rather than just showing me what she liked). She was also very closed off to me (emotionally, especially), and ended up attempting to slow fade, which led to me ending things. I was hesitant to get back into dating, but went onto tinder with no expectations.

Early days yet, and I'm not going to put pressure on things right now, but I can definitely see things evolving into something wholesome in the future if this continues.

So rewind to last Monday. Matched with an absolutely amazing lass. She's beautiful, quirky, funny, smart. We go for a date that involves ice skating and dinner. We both have a great time, we talk loads, we laugh, it's just. Genuinely a decent time, ya know? End if the night we sit in her car and she tells me to kiss her so I do, naturally. So now we just sit there kissing and talking and it's Just cute, right?

So we say our goodbyes and off she goes. Now sure, afterwards I'm pretty excited. First date in eight months (because I'm apparently rather undesirable and rather picky, go me) and it actually went WELL. Considering the fact the last date before then I was catfished and... Yeah. That was rough.

So I message her the next day to ask if she's genuinely interested in a second date? I picked out a museum because she's a rather smart lass and I figure she'd like it? Picked a day nearly a week later (I'll be honest it's the first date I've ever actually been on that went well enough that a second was a good idea, so I felt like a week was enough time? Maybe I'm wrong?) And she agrees! So there I am, pretty hyped, pretty happy, pretty excited. 

An hour and a half after the message agreeing to the second date she messages declaring ""Don't get me wrong, I had a great time last night but this is all a bit too much too fast. I understand the excitement but I'm a bit uncomfortable"" and proceeds to completely fall off the earth.

Was I too keen? Was me being pretty hyped for things to actually going well a bad thing? Honestly I fucking suck at this and it's really hit me for six, cause if it was just any other average date with any other regular person I'd had been like ""ah well, onwards and upwards"", but this genuinely went really well and it just.... Sucks I guess. Because I have no idea where I messed up here. Like if she had told me ""here's the issue, sorry, see ya around"" then at least I can walk away learning a bit more, but this is all new to me and I just suck at it lmao.

His grandpa is on his deathbed and he said he’s been in a foul mood all day today. Which is understandable. I asked him if he needs some space from me, because I, too, have been having a hard time dealing with friends and my depression. He said yeah, he just needs to process things. I haven’t been in this particular situation where I had to comfort someone who has a very close family member on their deathbed, so that was my best choice to give him. 

I told him he can reach me through text because I’m deleting all my apps (Snapchat and Instagram) where we usually talk. And I also told him it’s alright if he doesn’t reach out either, but he said he will. I doubt he will for a while, but I’d check in on him every couple days to make sure he’s alright. He has a bunch of friends that he probably would prefer to reach out to, so that’s why I doubt he’d talk to me. 

I’m also struggling with things considering my health and just stuff going on around it. We decided to hold off on being in a relationship due to all these circumstances. 

I’m just a bit sad that we may never be together because of these things. It’s getting so difficult to understand each other and I hope some space would lead us to come into an understanding of what we want and need from each other.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1152241,public,self,Guy (M24) I’ve (F22) been seeing for almost a year needs some space.
