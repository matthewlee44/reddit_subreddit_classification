6,q46jw7,1633726278,Don’t give up. Thoughts from a Scandinavian perspective while living in the US.,"For starters, I’m a Scandinavian guy who’s been living in several cities in the US for a couple of years now. Here’s some observations from my perspective. Excuse my grammatical errors (and my goofy accent). 

Let’s be frank, dating can be hard enough to begin with. Add in cross-cultural factors and you got yourself one helluva challenge. But I’m here to tell you that it’s not impossible, and when a date/relationship goes right, it’s even sweeter knowing you had to go through all those extra hurdles. 

Coming from Scandinavia, dating can be much more straightforward due to our homogeneous society. By far and large, the “do’s and don’t”, and the expectations for what a date looks like is very similar. Here, there can be hundreds of different cultures found within the same city, and thus, besides being a decent human, the lines are more blurred when it comes to dating. 

One of many of my blunders I’ve committed include arranging a picnic at a cemetery (in North Europe cemeteries in the cities are often public parks and are places where people hang out, drink, etc). I’ve taken a display christmas tree after asking at Anthropologie because on the date I found out that the girl didn’t have a Christmas tree, and I thought they were for sale at that store. Or how about the one time I was filling forms out and I asked a stranger if she would let me use her rubber (later I learned it’s called an eraser). 

I am perhaps lucky in that I’m above average height, decent looking and well mannered, so when it comes to making mistakes, may be I get away with more then I should. But truthfully I am nothing more then an idiot who means well. Is there a point to this? No, not really. Just remember that for every time a date goes wrong or takes an unexpected turn, don’t take life too seriously. Laugh, and laugh some more. We’re all learning.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q46jw7/dont_give_up_thoughts_from_a_scandinavian/
7,q46t5n,1633727054,(29M) How to go on first date with a female having a breakout that kills my confidence?,"My whole life I've dealt with acne and I've overcome alot and am now a skincare freak. I now take pride in my skin and it's one of my favorite qualities in myself and I get compliments because of it, but I have the occasional breakout under my lips that absolutely kill my self confidence and self esteem. And when I say breakout I mean one pimple, but I hate the P word because it's traumatizing to me, but wanted to illustrate it's one measly blemish for context. 

I occasional breakout other places on my face and I don't care, but this specific reoccurring blemish is just so unsightly. 

I'm sitting here wrapping up my Friday work day wanting to look for a date for tonight or tomorrow, but I am too embarrassed go on a first date with someone while having this thing on my face. 

I actually left the office early to finish my day working from home today. 60% of that decision was due to this. 

Is there a way to bring it up beforehand so I can put myself at ease knowing they are prepared? I think bringing it up in any way is a dead giveaway I don't have confidence and is a complete turn off. 

I know the healthy answer is for them to except me as I am and find the good qualities in me and I should be confident and not let one little (literally) thing ruin my night and there doesn't need to be any mention of it, but I'm not there yet mentally to overcome this.

Being a first timer, my jaws gave up on me after almost 7/8 minutes and I couldn’t get him to finish. Not sure how he lasted that long given that it was his first time receiving. But he did mention later that he was nervous so that might’ve been why. I went down on him again the same day but we had to cut it short due to other reasons so again, he didn’t finish. He began light heartedly making a joke out of this - “You couldn’t get me to come” and things similar to that. I didn’t find this very funny because being a beginner, it makes me feel as if I’m doing something wrong or I’m just really bad at giving blowjobs. What’s even worse is that he decided to make this joke in front of all our friends (we have the same friend group) and not only that, but he even allowed one of his friends to take part in this joke. I felt as if this wasn’t as deep as I was making out it to be so I laughed it off every time. 

Fast forward a while, I went down on him again and he guided me a little bit more. After a while he told me to switch to a handjob while kissing him. And he finally came. I was very happy thinking that maybe I was doing something right. Later I found out from one of my friends that he said, “Yeah she couldn’t make me come with a blowjob so she had to move on to a handjob.” First of all, I don’t know how I feel about him talking about our sex life to a group of people, specially in this way. Even after this day, he continues to make his little jokes. He even mentioned once that he thinks our sex might be bad (we’re both virgins).

Before he started making his jokes, I was actually very into giving blowjobs and wanted to do it often, regardless of him not finishing the first two times. But this whole situation is completely turning me off and I don’t feel like giving him head again. I know he doesn’t intentionally mean to hurt me but I think he might fixating too much on the idea of him “lasting super long” to the point where it’s hurting my feelings.

13,q47j49,1633729326,Losing contact with a girl I love and met on Discord. What should I do?,"&gt;!English is not my native language, so bear with me.!&lt;

Okay so,

I've met this girl around a year ago in a Discord server. For context, it was a sort of game community server, and we both (and still are) moderators there. We started chatting here and there. It really picked up around early December, and we chatted and called daily, often into late hours. At this point I think I already fell kind of in love with her. In march we added each other on snapchat. We didnt really used snapchat much in the beginning. Some snaps here and there, and mostly chats. After some time we got that yellow heart thingy. She sometimes sent me a cute snap, like really sometimes. And I think we now have that super BFF heart for around 2.5-3 months. However, recently I noticed that we lost a bit of contact. We still chat and call daily, but like it feels different. Especially because I think there is a ""new guy"" in the picture. I know, I sound really jealous. And when I send her a message it feels like she doesn't want to talk to me, or doesn't want a message from me. She answers really short and uninterested. This only happens in the evening when that ""new guy"" is online. But in the morning she always sends me a (voice)message. I just don't know what to do, or what to think. Am I paranoid and too jealous, or am I just overreacting.

And yes, I really would like to tell her how I feel about her. But I'm just afraid she doesn't feel the same way, and that it'll end/harm the friendship. Or that I am just too late, because of that ""new guy"".

15,q47lxp,1633729566,Weeding out abusive men,"It seems like many people have different opinions on this. But I have encountered a lot of abusive or controlling men when I have tried dating. Some I quickly cut off when I noticed it but other men were very nice at first and it was hard to see that they were abusive until the relationship became more serious. I have had to get a couple restraining orders. Stuff like this scares me, seeing the statistics on violence against women scares me. I discussed what the best strategy to weed out abusive men is, especially the ones who hide the red flags well. Some people think that it is bad to talk about any type of abusive relationships you have had in the past with your date at least for the first few months of dating. The idea behind this is because if your date happens to be an abuser he will look at you as an easy target and think you tolerate abusive men. However I also know others who have told me that it may be good to mention that you have encountered abusive men in your past, but make a point to mention that these men did not get away with it, you called the police etc. That way if your date happens to be an abusive person he will see you aren’t a weak target and you will not tolerate abuse. 

I know for me personally, I went on a couple dates with a guy and he asked me about my relationship history. I explained I had dated some normal guys but also guys that turned out to be abusive and I had to end the relationship and get the police involved and how I hope I never have to go through that again. The guy who had been interested in me, didn’t contact me after that. I had honestly answered his question, because I believe in being honest but I wondered about what happened there . My first instinct was that he was an abuser who didnt want to get in trouble and could see I wouldn’t tolerate abuse , why else would he stop talking to me? My second thought when I thought more about it was that some men seem to think that there are a whole lot of women making up false allegations against men, and men are afraid of it. I spoke to police and victim witness court advocates about the idea that women make stuff up about abuse from men, out or curiosity on the stats and I was told both times that it is extremely rare when this happens and usually doesn’t go far because usually you need evidence for convictions. I think the cases where this stuff happens are usually when women want a lot of money from a guy who has a lot of it, otherwise I guess I don’t see much of a point. And of course some of these cases are highly publicized. There really isn’t a point to make things like this up if you aren’t going to sue civilly as you need evidence for this stuff to be prosecuted in criminal court. However not everyone is educated on this stuff and people can have misconceptions. I would still like to know if I should be be discussing any of this at all with dates when they ask about previous relationships, or if there should be a time frame when it should be discussed .

I used to live where he lives and the only reason I haven't moved back is because I am waiting on a few personal life circumstances to improve (the family dogs are 12 and declining, my job is contract, I just resigned my lease, etc.)

 It's been fun, I enjoy his company, and like him as a person. He's also attractive, and seems like he is a responsible adult. He has everything I look for in a potential partner overall. Problem is... Neither of us are ready for a serious, committed relationship. He just got out of a long term 6 year, and I've had my fair share of horrible relationships including but not limited to being cheated on, abused, and lied to.

We both like one another as people, openly, and have both expressed we aren't ready for a relationship. He also brings the distance factor up a bit in regards to that, while also letting me know he enjoys my company.


I don't have any need to have a sexual relationship with him nor anyone else, and am unsure if it would be better for me to be single and focus on myself in therapy, as I am working heavily on learning self-love.

I (23M) have started to realize that every girl I have dated, I haven’t truly loved.

I enjoy relationships and companionship, but once a girl really starts to like me I just get carried away and go into a relationship just because the girl at the time is really into me. Don’t get me wrong, I like the person, but it just makes me upset having felt a feeling of ‘who am I kidding, I don’t actually love this girl’, while actively saying so to the girl.

39,q49q4e,1633736501,please help I have Nobody else to give me advice for something like this,"this is a little long winded but its me first post here so please read fully .

&amp;#x200B;

I (20M) started a new job and I met this girl 25(F) and we don't work for the same company as Im a third party contractor at the place she works at.She is in HR and I have a position in Building Maintenance I make about 33 an hour for reference. But getting to the point I have talked with her alot in the time ive been there and she is so great we are very similar and have the same exact sense of humor. We are so similar that I sometimes complete her sentences and jokes without intending too and it just feels so easy and effortless to talk with her it feels as if ive known her for years.

Earlier this week I made up an excuse to go too her office and talk she said ""can I tell you something off the record"" and  we talked about how one of my Co-workers had actually came on to her and tried asking her out too which she replied ""IM A LESBIAN"". We laughed about it and continued to talk and bullshit for a while until she had to attend a meeting.

( I should add in here that its not just a one sided conversation as im always told I talk too much about pointless shit but when im talking too her she is often the one who talks just a little more and I enjoy listening to her)

Today I saw her again and we talked on and off for the day mostly just random bullshit and just joking around and learning about eachother.  I learned that she is not a strict 100% lesbian but she's Bi and that's why she prefers the term queer. However she leans more in favor of women. We talked alot about sex and our sex lives. This was odd too me as I've never had such an open conversation like this with a woman. in the same conversation we talked about how we had both smoked cigarettes and  had quit. she proudly showed me this app she has that tracks the amount of time since you've smoked. ""it was 13 days"" but there was another tracker about 50 days.

I had not seen the other tracker originally but I know of it because she ""said don't ask about the other one"" so naturally I ask and she says ""it's the amount of time since I've had sex"" and we both laugh about it and continue talking until we actually had to work again and we didn't  see each other for the rest of today.

This last conversation was when we also learned about eachothers ages and when I said I turn 21 in 2 months she jokingly said ""omg your a baby"" I asked how old she was she said 25 I replied ""its not even a huge difference"" and she again jokingly says ""yea but 25 in girl years"". this was also where she asked how much I make at the position I'm at and was impressed when I told her that was just starting rate and we talked about how she had gone to college and I trade school.

I had also learned she was moving to another state because she felt a bit impulsive and applied for the same position she had but somewhere else. I will admit I was a bit upset because I would be losing someone who is an amazing friend whom I  genuinely enjoy conversation with but I supported her and I teased her a bit on her choice of where to go and it did come up that she wont be there forever and will eventually come back.

I guess I'm just conflicted about this and you guys probably guessed but I'm attracted to this girl however its not the normal "" Shes hot I wana fuck her"" its more of a ""I enjoy conversation with her and she actually makes me laugh"". In fact she isn't even the type I would normally find attractive and actually has some traits I would normally find a turn off like not shaving her armpits. I always thought to myself that my preferences could never be changed but I do not know how but this girl is an exception to those preferences. I should add I do still think is attractive and I think she has a very cute face and wonderful eyes.

What do I do? I don't want to lose her as a friend by asking her out and being rejected and even if I don't completely lose her as a friend it would just make things awkward between us and I don't want that to happen.

I'm sorry if this was frustrating to read but I'm not used to expressing how I feel and In fact as im writing this I don't think I've ever expressed how I feel to anyone lmao. if you do comment thank you as I don't really have anyone who I can ask for this type of advice from in real life. and if you need any more info please ask",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q49q4e/please_help_i_have_nobody_else_to_give_me_advice/

After 2 years of successful therapy and figuring out how to take care of my own needs. Idk how to add in dating?
 
Feels like it takes a lot (or less?) For me to actually fall for someone.  It's rare.

I genuinely love other people, but in a platonic way mostly. People are awesome and I like getting to know them without pressure of having to date said person.
So it usually turns out I'll like them after they gave up or they smother me till I can't take it anymore. 

But I prefer not to speak to people on a daily basis unless I have a deep connection with them or I'm paid to do so.
I still crave that deep connection though :/ like with a best friend.  I state my boundaries as nicely as possible and newer people still think they are the exception already which ends up being a turn off. 

Maybe I'm just enjoying time with myself more and the genuine friends in my life. 

My guess is to continue with what I'm doing and the right human will come along. 

Plan on asking therapist about this as well, curious on other opinions/experiences though ❤️",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q4a3h7/how_do_you_balance_needing_more_introvert_time/

I feel so confused, like am I in, should say more stuff or shouldn’t, will complimenting her be too much, or too little. There are so many things you gotta look out for, like I asked one of her friends and instead of bringing more clarity I just got even more confused, she’s bi and there’s this girl she has something with, and it’s either that they like each other, one does one does and one doesn’t, one scared, or there’s nothing and they’re friends, I have no fucking clue. In the mean time it’s like we’re talking all the time over text and it’s great, then I get really confused in person and it’s not like I expect her to like me from text. Like I dunno how to explain it, just feels completely different you know. It’s just confusing as shiet cause you know I like her and she didn’t say we were friends and only that and like I haven’t any indication of what her opinion of me is. it’s like trying to climb a wall, that if I just say “fuck it I’m climbing it” I will fall, so the other option isn’t climbing it, but I want to get over the fucking wall, just am so confused by it I can’t make heads or tails. Like bro I look at all my other friends and shit seems to come together so easily then I look at my situation and I feel like I just can’t compete. Like we talk bout stuff we’re both interested and like hell she literally painted my nails the other day, lent into me when I put my arm around her, chillin listening to music, then theres this weird situation with this other girl, maybe, and like no indications of anything. It’s possible I’m overthinking the shit outve this but regardless, I’m so confused.

Now we are working back on site. After exchanging for awhile we started talking outside of work almost everyday. It seemed to me that we really hit it off and had similar interests. But I might of messed it up. 

A little back story: many years I have been insecure about my looks and weight. Over 2021 I have changed a lot in my life in a lot of ways.

So when we started talking more and more outside of work I let my insecurities get the best of me. I wouldn’t be open when we talked about myself or let her know really anything about me. 

We stopped talking and haven’t in 3 weeks. Also since we are in person now at work she seems to talk to everyone at work but avoids me. I understand I let myself get in front of me. I know now I want to be open and confident. I have done some self therapy and talked with friends and family. And feel like I’m in a better place mind set wise and ready to put myself back out there

I’ve tried to talk to her since and I got the impression she didn’t want to talk and try to run me off the phone. 

I’m ready for the next step in my dating life and wanted to ask for people opinions and advice. Do I keep trying to talk to her and see if I can turn this around and ask her on a date? My fear tho is she’ll say no and it’ll be super awkward at work.

I don't like cars, football, pumping iron, or drinking. I like cooking and reading. I enjoy conversations where I can be open and vulnerable about my feelings.

I've found that I have a really easy time making female friends when I just be myself. Before I started to accept what my interests truly were, I've found that I can attract people and get a lot of dates when I try to be a more ""masculine"" version of myself. But I have the hardest time getting dates when I'm just being me.

When I talk to my female friends, they'll tell me to be myself and someone who'll accept who I am will come along.

I went to house to use the bathroom and it smelt like straight up cat piss and he just seemed like a dirty person. These to me are all red flags but I love to ignore red flags bc my friends keep on insisting to go out with him bc he’s so nice. Saturday comes we go to the Mariners game with his friend the entire time I can’t read the vibe if he’s tryna talk to me or not. Let’s just say his friend ends up trying to flirt with me all night. At the end of the night I’m tipsy I go home. Turns out I left my ID and debit card with him. Instead of giving it to me the next day this man waits 6 days to then come and drop it off at my leasing office. Mind you he was ignoring me all week. I called him today bc this was just ridiculous and he finally answers and we agree to meet to get my things. When I say I feel so disrespected it’s an understatement. I’ve never had someone who was so turned off by me that they had to be so petty. All throughout this he was ignoring me when I was calling to get my things. He’s over here telling his friends I’m moving fast but he wants to date me and take things slow. The entire span of this was a week. You put your number in my phone. You asked me on a date twice. You planned future dates, yet I’m moving so fast? I feel like this man intentionally wanted to try and stunt on me and then ghost me like it was a plan.I am just so mad that I allowed someone who I normally wouldn’t be interested in to play me. I feel like such a fool. I can’t help but be so mad.  I just feel like I was so nice to this person and then for no reason you try and turn around and just be rude. It seemed like this man knew what he was doing and thoughtfully planned out everything. I am just in a loss for words.

My girlfriend is attractive, huge boobs, and great at sex, but she is older and in her mid-40s. My boyfriend is a muscular type, big dick, bodybuilder kind of guy, who is just a few years older than me (I am 25). My girlfriend is VERY open-minded and thinks my relationship with my boyfriend is ""cute"". My boyfriend, on the other hand, seems to dislike my relationship with my girlfriend. He is completely gay and doesn't really understand what I see in a woman. Sometimes he will walk in on me having sex with my girlfriend (or kissing) and later, while he and I are having sex, he will say ""I thought that was disgusting"".

My boyfriend stimulates me in an amazing way. Despite having a girlfriend, I am the ""bottom"" in the relationship, and I LOVE prostate pleasure (especially from his big cock), but I am very attracted to women too. In contrast, my girlfriend has often seen my boyfriend and I having sex and later, once we're done, she will slap my ass and say ""I saw you really enjoyed that cock!""

65,q4bsc0,1633744061,I finally have feelings for someone and... she doesn't,"Warning: this post is basically just a juvenile rant about unrequited feelings.

I (a man) do really well with women and have a lot of women in my life. I casually date a lot and have FWBs in several different cities. But I haven't really had strong feelings for anyone in years. Until recently. I took a weeklong trip with this one woman I'd been seeing for a while and she's just amazing. I feel so happy spending time around her. 

Unfortunately there seems to be a pretty massive discrepancy in our feelings... She seems content to continue hanging out with me occasionally, for now, but I don't think she is particularly enchanted with me and a relationship is not on the table. 

It's so, so disappointing. I know how full of myself this sounds, but I go through most of my life feeling like I could have just about any woman I want. It's not literally true of course, but I just feel like it's easy to get women. And now for the first time in years I actually have strong feelings for someone, and of course *she* is the one I can't have. 

I've got an active social life but I feel lonely all the time without her. It's so crazy to me to think how differently we must have perceived that week together. 

Not even sure where to go from here. I guess I just keep meeting women and hope that in another few years I find someone else I actually have feelings for and that this time she reciprocates.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q4bsc0/i_finally_have_feelings_for_someone_and_she_doesnt/

We’ve had a few hiccups but I was giving him the benefit of doubt. The last “hiccup” put me off because I was disappointed maybe I expected a bit too much from him because I felt some sort of connection. 

We were speaking non stop in constant contact. This stopped after he gave me an underwhelming response to a picture I sent him of a dress. Keep in mind he regularly sends body pics of him at the gym, I always compliment him. He ignored the ones I sent. 

I couldn’t bring myself around to responding to him since it bothered me a lot more than it should have. I haven’t even met him yet so I don’t want to have such a conversation. Too soon and too much pressure.

Right from the start he asked me out on a date for this Saturday. I haven’t spoken to him since Thursday and he’s tried to contact me. After his cold response I had no idea what to say to him if I’m being completely honest. 

Okay here’s where the guilt kicks in…

My friend set me up with a guy. She gave him my number and he called me after work. I already knew what he looked like and I did like what I saw. He gave me a proposition, I should let him pick me up and have a conversation. 

I went along with it and he took me to a bar with some live music and it was honestly lovely. I don’t understand why I feel so guilty and weird. I’m completely torn. 

Do I give the guy from today a chance? We have a friendly conversation and we had some chemistry. Or do I see them both? The first guy was on my mind a lot of the night. 

I feel like if I saw the first guy in person maybe it’d translate better. I could see myself in a relationship with him but this new guy is a risk.

77,q4cm2c,1633747400,Do you think that she is interested?,"So I have made an online friend for about 3.5 years now. Have not met in real life yet due to the geographical locations being really far apart. Though there may be times when I think that she is trying to shoot her shot. Not too sure if she is interested in meeting up because we are great friends or she wishes to develop the connection into a relationship. Here are a few pointers that I picked over the few years of conversations. Im 23 and she is 32 in 2021.

1. Suggesting staying at her place while visiting Seoul, at first was with rent. But now, for free

2. Suggested visiting numerous attractions of which I thought, that is way too many places (Amusement parks, picnics, Hiking). Basically it feels as though I might be travelling with her everyday during my trip to South Korea.

3. Suggested that if I were to visit Busan, she would allow me to stay at her younger brother's place. (Cus the younger cant refuse the older siblings). Not too sure about this one though, but it may be a possibility that her family knows me now, as the guy who sent in a box of snacks that one time.

4. Wants to treat me to meals, or cook for me. As a thank you for all the times that I had helped her out. Very generous and kind of her, but after hearing all the suggested places and food she wants to give a treat, it may be to the point that every meal is covered.

5. She mentioned that I helped her through tough times of which till now i cant deduce what that tough moment was. All I did and can do is to listen over a phone call to her rants and worries.

6. Basically me going to Korea feels like an almost complimentary trip.

7. On a phone call, she said 'I like you', to which i replied: 'Oh me too'. She said 'I like you' again to prompt me to say 'I like you too'

8. Said that I talk like people around her age, seeing us as equals. Interesting thing is that, probably in the first few months of this friendship, she mentioned that she wished that I was around her age. Moving forward to 1.5 years, she said that she sees me like a guy of her age (The way I talk, her perception of my maturity) and at 3 years she mentioned that age is just a number.

9. Sometimes tells me who hits on her or going for blind dates in the past. 

10. Overall, could be just friendly vibes, but none can be decided until the meeting in real life

That all happened this past Tuesday.

90,q4dep0,1633750663,Does anybody else feel like they just don’t have “it?”,"Think about someone you know who loves something like acting or music and commits themselves 110% to the study of that thing but in your heart you know they’ll never be successful in that field no matter how hard they try because they’re just lacking something. It might be luck, or it might just be “it.” That unnamed thing that nobody quite knows how to define or explain, it just is.

I think this idea applies to dating and recently I’ve just been starting to feel like I don’t have “it.” I’ve been told I’m funny, attractive, and caring. I’m a great conversationalist and I love meeting new people. I’m not frugal and I’m very empathic towards the people I care about. But for whatever reason, I can’t seem to nail dating. I’ve been on fun and amazing dates that don’t result in anything. I either get ghosted, friendzoned or left on read.

I’m just curious if anyone else feels like this or knows someone who checks all the boxes but can never seem to find anyone for whatever reason that’s not easily discernible.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q4dep0/does_anybody_else_feel_like_they_just_dont_have_it/
91,q4dhaw,1633750945,25M Ghosted after a supposedly great meet up,"Met up with a woman last week. Everything went smoothly. The conversation flowed. Received a message stating that she found the whole thing chill and fun and was looking forward to the next meeting, which was supposed to have happened yesterday. It's been radio silence starting from Tuesday. No idea what caused things to go awry. I even was removed on the app. Im no stranger to being ghosted, but those didnt happen after a meet up. There was a failure to launch. Last time was another scenario where things were seemingly on an upward trajectory; however, you know the rest.

93,q4do9l,1633751768,Rejected by all potential partners,"I was struggling with relationships so I took people's advice of ""working on yourself"" for 2 years and didn't pursue any woman. Then over that time I felt like I had learned more about myself and grown as a person and I was more confident. However that confidence was short lived because now every girl I show any intrest in or try to talk to ignores or rejects me. What should I do? It's clearly me not them, since eveyone else is able to find love. What am I doing wrong?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q4do9l/rejected_by_all_potential_partners/

Since we started I've been trying to get a date or something casual I just don't know how to bring up the idea to her. I feel like she's interested in me or she's just being nice I'll let it to your judgment. We always stare at each other when we cross paths, we chat in a way that we fake fun of each other. We bump into each other in a friendly way (i.e. I'm squatting fixing something and she would hit me with her hips).",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q4dwd4/how_to_make_the_first_move_in_this_situation/

98,q4e6v6,1633753964,No experience,"As a person who’s never dated it is similar to looking for a job you have no experience in. A job you really want but the requirements states you need this and that! The same rule apply with dating. I tell a guy I have no experience or I’m a virgin it makes it highly unlikely for me to land a date, future dates, or a potential relationship. How am I going to gain experience when no one wants to give me the experience. By experience I mean mostly a relationship.
