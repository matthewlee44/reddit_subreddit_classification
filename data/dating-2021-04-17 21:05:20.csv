1,mt4a1j,1618712548,Is it fair of me (23F) to break up with my boyfriend (28M) because he won't stop smoking?,"So my boyfriend smokes and I let him know early on that smoking is dealbreaker for me. He told me he would try to quit. The thing is, he lives at home and his parents are also heavy smokers and the entire house smells like smoke because they smoke inside. So it's been tough for him to quit because his parents are always smoking around him. He recently told me that he is back to smoking 10-15 cigs a day (when he was on a 1-2 cigs a day streak). And honestly, I could smell it on him when we hung out a few days ago. He also said he noticed I could smell the smoke when he hugged me and that he would try harder to quit. 

I just really don't like the idea of smoking and the health/long term impacts of it, as well as the smell and odour. Should I bring this up with him one more, and if so, how do I go about it? Or do I just break up with him? I really can't stand the smoking.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mt4a1j/is_it_fair_of_me_23f_to_break_up_with_my/

3,mt4d6i,1618712907,Should I continue or should I move on?,"I (22F) just got out of a long term relationship a few months ago. I’m now at a point where I want to start dating again and meet new people so I downloaded Tinder. I matched with this guy who is a few years older than I am (25) but we went to the same high school together. I made the first move to talk to him and we instantly hit it off and I got his number. 

We do have mutual friends and I discovered that he hasn’t had a girlfriend in a really long time due to school and having a full time hard labor job, which I understand and not an issue. 

Our conversations are going great and he seemed to be interested in me. We have a ton in common and we talk like we’ve known each other for awhile. However, he constantly ghosts me. If he leaves me on read, we don’t speak for a few days and I would hope that he would reach out, but I’ve been the one to initiate the conversation each time I don’t hear anything from him. He’s only texted me first once but that was it. But whenever I do reach out, we continue texting like nothing happened and everything is going great, but then around the same time every day he will leave me on read. We haven’t been on a date yet and I’ve been hinting to him about hanging out, but it goes right over his head. I’m getting tired of making the first move and I would like him to at least try.

The question is, could him not reaching out or not asking to hangout due to the fact he hasn’t had a girlfriend in a long time and he’s shy or is it because he’s just not interested? I’m just not sure if I should just move on or if I should continue to talk to him.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mt4d6i/should_i_continue_or_should_i_move_on/

12,mt4zqs,1618715533,"Met a person just when I thought they were right for me, they called it off","I have been single for the better part of the last decade. I'm 29. And its not like I've been sleeping around either. Been working on my career and such, making myself better. But Ive been really lonely and the lack of female intamacy has left me feeling somewhat insecure, even though Ive been in multiple 3-5 year relationships in the past. about 6 months ago or so I decided to seriously get on dating apps and try my luck. 

I met a wonderful young lady and we connected instantly. We went on dates, became close, helped each other through problems, and have both had a hard childhood and had to assume vast responsibilities at a young age. I felt a real connection with her. Not to mention my physical attraction for her grew to a crazy amount. I think I am more attracted to her than I can remember being towards someone.  Background of her, she has been in a 5 year abusive relationship and got out a year before seeing me, but also said that she would see her ex up until a few weeks before we started seeing each other.

She asked me if I loved her when we were drunk one night and I said I think I could. She then asked if we would ever be boyfriend and girlfriend and I said right now, I am not ready yet, due to my current situation. I am in the middle of being kicked out of my current house and frantically packing things up and looking for new houses at the same line to meet the deadline at the end of the month and I needed time to think about my feelings and process things. We had been talking at this point frequently ever day for almost 3 months. 

A week later,  I noticed that she no longer seemed interested in texting me or seeing me. I asked her what was up and she said since I asked she might as well tell me and be honest. She said its nothing I did but she has depression and has to work on her own stuff and cant spend time with me anymore because she hasn't even had time to work on herself. . I honestly feel like I fucked things up somehow because of my fear of commitment but I have opened up to her more than I have opened up to any human in the past 6-7 years and it really hurts to feel rejected by her. Now we don't talk and are blocked on social media because it hurts to see her posts. 

I have debated messaging her but I fear just being rejected again, and at the same time, I feel like I cant just be that guy that is sitting around waiting for her to come back to me. I have to move on. I just hate this and honestly wish I just said yes and made her my girlfriend, but then if I honestly wasn't ready, things could have ended even worse than they already did. The last time I talked to her, she did say she had feelings for me and she thinks I am the perfect person for her, but like I said earlier she has her own  issues she wants to work on herself. Its been a week since we talked and I still miss the fuck out of her. I feel like I fucked up.

I've tried getting back on dating sites and been talking to girls, but while it helps me feel a little better I am somewhat not interested and I still want her because she had emotional depth and understood me. I feel like I wont find that easily again and she's honestly all I want right now.

So, my girl ( let's call her A) met this girl an year ago. They hit it off instantly as they were in the same fandom of a show my girl likes. ( I didn't watch the show so yeah, she can't really talk to me about it as much as she can). This girl, lets call her B fell in love with my girl. And because she was jealous of me, she with her several friend trolled me on instagram. Spread the rumour that I am a harasser and stuff. When my girl found out, I expected her to stop being friends with that girl but she didn't. She asked her to stop and continued being friends. I let it go. 
After a few days, girl B started to emotionally harass my girl. She would fight with her and throw tantrums if my girl does anything she doesn't want her to do. she started to emotionally manipulate my girl. And I tried talking to my girl about this but that lead to an heated argument. My girl didn't talk with me for a few days. When she came back, we both apologized to eachother. We had a long talk about how that girl is bad for her mental health. She agreed yet stayed friends with her. 
A few days later she confessed that she has feelings for girl B. I saw it coming and blamed myself. I thought it wouldn't have happened if I had treated her right. I accepted the situation. 
After a few months, my girl confessed that she has been fooling around with girl B, I forgave her for that. I talked to her about it. I made her understand that it hurted me and all. 
Now, just a few days ago, girl B did something that broke my girl's heart. They were best friends as my girl claimed. She betrayed my girl and yet my girl wants to be friend with her.

When someone loses their sh*t,"When someone can't have a clear, calm, and direct conversation about something you experienced or they did, that's a massive red flag, right? I was able to acknowledge the hurt/pain I caused them with some of my actions, but they were trying to equate our actions to the same (they were objectively not, as this person's actions even had some of my family members concerned, though I do know I had been hurtful in other ways). They also kept associating intentions to my actions, that were not my actual intentions (though they were willing to say that maybe my intentions weren't to hurt them). When I asked to discuss, they elevated their voice, kept covering their ears and going ""lalala I'm not listening"", just lost their shit more and more and kept telling me I had no idea how to communicate and that they were done with me and I'm ""full of shit"" among other things. For the record, I didn't speak to them in the same way. I simply said, ""when and if you're ever ready to actually reflect on the things you say/do to me, we can talk"" and because they kept telling me I was full of shit, I said to not contact me again.

Our relationship had been toxic in the past and I thought they were getting better, as I was able to address most of my side of things and was wanting a pretty peaceful and healthy relationship. But this among a few things had me really concerned, especially since they demanded exclusivity today out of nowhere (we were broken up and sort of talking/seeing each other lately but the request for exclusivity was sudden and they were time-pressuring me/telling me to leave their apartment if I said no). I was hoping for discussions. 

Is it best to just walk away from this for good? It's tough to date right now and me and this person had a pretty serious relationship before and I was starting to believe that they had done the awareness work and were going to be a good partner, but how they handled the conflict seemed so incredibly immature to me and like it'd be a lot of work.

 I've recently finished with a client. She's my age and seems to be single. She's very attractive, extremely pleasant and kind, is very easy to talk to and seems to be very driven in her professional life. She's also done a great job with her dog, but like I said she's very driven and capable. 

Our last meeting we took a walk around a park downtown to work on walking her dog around lots of distractions. These are usually 30-45 minutes but we spent almost an hour and a half just walking and talking. Some about the dog, but mostly about ourselves and personal lives, families etc. We kept passing her car and I'd expect her to stop and say OK well great see ya later, but she'd just keep walking by. 

I've become increasingly smitten by her (lol) over the weeks and really enjoyed our last conversation. 

If it makes a difference, she texted me when she got home of a picture of her dog. A couple of texts back and forth and she thanked me for all my help. 

I never do this with clients, and I wanted to wait until our professional relationship had ended, but I'd really like to ask her out. I'm just so taken with her I feel like I need give it a shot. If she says no, it's not the end of the world, it's just not meant to be. But I'd just be kicking myself if I didn't at least ask. 

Soooo....thoughts? Is this OK? How long should I wait to do it? Ideas for what to say?? All help appreciated lol",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mt629o/dating_an_ex_client/

I’ve been on every medication, face wash, face cream and still nothing gets rid of the acne scars. I have acne scars on my back, like about 50% of my back is covered in acne scars and hyperpigmentation and I worry it’ll be a turn off for guys. I feel like I should just put cover up foundation on my back so that guys don’t notice the acne scars, and I wonder if this is a turn off when dating?

We were planning on going out tmrw but when I messaged her to make plans she said she thought she was ready to date but isn't. Ngl it's a lil disappointing and I'm worried she might ghost me, I'd much rather us stay in contact and be friends than make dating the only option and not see her again.

To be honest I think I gotta place the blame on digital communication, when I asked her out she seemed pretty into me, but when I texted her I barely got a response. Text is impossible to be charming through since tone is decided by the reader, best anyone can be is witty. Text is so impersonal and easy to say no through. I'm hoping I can save it next time we work together but I'm not getting my hopes up, in fact my hopes are pretty down.

It's rare enough for me to find someone I find interesting, rarer to find one who's single, even rarer for me to have an opportunity to date them, and rarer still for me to actually ask em out and them to say yes, so this was a real rare shot and I'm really feeling the disappointment from losing it",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mt6hs7/shes_not_ready_to_date_but_she_said_yes_at_first/

He was physically abusive about a year ago and I thought he changed but I know I’m definitely better off just not staying with someone like that. Unfortunately I barely have friends because I’d spend all my time with him and not really try and get to know people but I’m hoping that changes soon and I can work on creating good friendships. 

I was super stressed all day yesterday but decided to go on a dating app just because, and decided to meet up with a guy for drinks. I haven’t been impressed with guys I’ve met lately but I had the best night ever with him.

I won’t give details but been dating this guy for over 2 months now and by dating I mean mostly screwing to put it nicely but he says we are in a committed relationship and we are boyfriend and girlfriend 

I just discovered he is actually married after a friend told me his behavior sounds like a married man because she’s been through it.  

I did some digging and found out indeed he’s lied about timelines.  He could be separated but it would be fairly recently. I specifically asked if he was married a couple times and he said no once and the first time I realize he worded it carefully but didn’t say “no” in fact 

So now I need a plan of action. I want to let the wife know.  If they’re separated and she is aware then no harm really... but whatever he says, I won’t be able to trust since he’s lied so much.  

I really would love to have some justice.... I detest liars and feel betrayed... but glad I haven’t fallen for him due to his behavior.  I’ve seen some red flags but was giving  him the benefit of the doubt far too much.  The sex is freaking amazing and honestly I think I’ve let that cloud my thinking.   

So what do I do? What would you do? I have an idea for a plan I can execute soon... just would love to mess w/him a little.  I have proof of what I’ve found and plan to show him.  Just hoping to get answers from him but even then I can’t trust him so it’ll be over.... just I’m not a scheming type but would love some ideas on how others would and have handled it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mt6rqj/found_out_boyfriend_is_married_how_to/

I have always liked to stay at home a lot. Do not like traveling our public places. I’m active with my hobbies at home and also freelance work at home.

I have a pretty fixed routine and a set of special interests.

Dating makes me anxious and takes energy. I also have autism + ADHD.

However, I do feel lonely often. I’m happy with myself but feel it's difficult to connect with most people. I get anxious. Dealing with dating takes my anxiety to another level. When I feel lonely and meet people I sometimes even feel more lonely while with them.

However, would like to meet a girl that likes to stay at home as much as I and be creative.

I’m good at texting and flirting online. Much better than IRL. I guess it might be due to my high-functioning autism.

However they all kept bringing up their significant others and relating to each other’s boyfriend’s or even husband’s behaviors and I just felt so...left out.

I am so happy for them, truly. But I couldn’t help but feel a twinge of bitterness, not directed towards anyone in particular but I guess towards my luck when it comes to dating. Instead of feeling less lonely with my friends I felt worse. I just want someone to be intimate with, I just want someone who I can be really really close  to and the only experience I have with that was my shitty ex. 

I wish I had more single friends so I could have someone to talk to whose life is at the same pace as mine. Everyone I know is either in a serious relationship, engaged, or married.

I have been on every free dating app you can think of, but am now thinking about Match. The issue I'm having, is the payment. Apparently you cannot simply do a month-to-month payment. The least amount of time you can pay for is 3 MONTHS. 

So I decided to try this. I have a debit card that is not tied to my bank, I bought it from a pharmacy. Something called GreenDot. I have around 400 on here give or take. So, if I paid an installment plan of 28 dollars every 14 days, and take out all my money and dispose of the card before the next installment payment, can they do anything? If they just terminate my account, oh well.

We're still very casual but gotten to know each other on a deeper level gradually. He told me early on he is unavailable for a relationship right now and just wants to 'have fun' and 'see how things go' with me. I told him I was also just casually dating at the moment, but would want to settle if I find the right person. I also made it clear to him I will not do anything sexual with him past making out because I only get intimate with my serious/committed partners. Even though i like him a lot, I don't think i am truly ready to jump back into a commitment, or even exclusively investing in someone emotionally so soon. But he keeps sending me mixed signals and it is so confusing.

He remembers little details about my life and our conversations, and listens to me vent to him. Every time we meet up, he would ask if I am seeing other men. I never ask if he's seeing other women because we are just casual and it's none of my business. He would also ask me what my ideal type of guy was and wouldn't stop pestering me until I gave a straight answer (which I never did). He asked me what qualities I find attraction/hot in men. He even joked about us being a couple and getting married and having kids.

He knows I have been seeing other people (I even told him about a horrible date I went on with another guy couple of weeks ago). Yesterday he suddenly said he quit using dating apps and he's the type of man who only focuses on one girl at a time. I told him I have stopped seeing other people recently as well, mainly because I am too busy at work to date around. I'm just really confused by him because I thought we both agreed this wouldn't be an exclusive/committed relationship, and we're both free to see other people and even drop each other at any given time.

He also kept saying if he didn't like a girl and enjoyed her company, he wouldn't keep going on dates with her. He also suggested us to go to a nice hotel some day; I declined and reminded him I would not have sex with people who are not my romantic partner, and he said he wasn't persuading me to have sex but he just wanted to cuddle me close. He also joked about falling in love with me last night and I didn't really know how to reply to that so I just kind of laughed it off.

Idk if I am reading too much into this but I am confused by his inconsistency. I don't want to be led on or accidentally lead someone else on.

53,mt7g19,1618726566,[27M] Worst period of dating in my life so far,"I’ll start by saying I am a very romantic and sexual person, so the last 4 years have been very difficult for me. I haven’t had sex in over a year and haven’t had a girlfriend in over 5 years.  

From age 19-22 I was in community college and working in a restaurant and surrounded by attractive women. I had many dating opportunities and enjoyed it very much. I had romantic relations with 10-15 different women up to this point. 

I then transferred to a university at age 23 for engineering, graduated at 25 and have been working in engineering ever since. Ever since 23 years old, dating has been brutal. No women at my job. No women in my classes when I was in school, most my friends are now married. I used tinder, bumble, hinge, Facebook dating, all with no success. 

My friend and I try going out to bars and dancing but it’s just not the same.  It’s so much more difficult to meet someone out at night compared to working with them or being in school with them. 

It really makes me question my choice of career. I chose it only because I knew it would allow me to support a family and have a home. But now that I can’t even meet a woman to start a family, it makes me want to go do something different. Common sense makes me think that changing my career for dating is really stupid, but I can’t keep going on like this.

55,mt7i4x,1618726855,Moral dilemma (relationship) - some advice pls? [India]," Okay this is very India-specific, so not sure how many here can relate, but worth trying anyway.

So here's the situation:

Let's say you're a single 26/27 year old girl, who's well read, knowledgeable &amp; stand for feminism, anti-patriarchy &amp; are basically a 'woke' kind of millennial girl.

Your parent is the usual traditional/conservative parent who puts your profile on a Matrimony site - which you hate because it is community-caste based.

Meanwhile you're on dating apps like Bumble etc - but you're having a tough time finding a dude who's sensible, kind but also shares similar outlooks / tastes as you with regards to the world, culture, music, films, food etc. And you are only looking for a serious long-term commitment, no flings.

Then your mum / dad ends up giving your number to one of the Matrimony dudes, who then texts you. You obviously hate this &amp; ignore it &amp; tell him saying you aren't interested in this politely &amp; move on.

But then the guy also says he shares similar views on these sites &amp; that it was forced upon him by a family member etc. He even seems open to dating &amp; not necessarily in a hurry to get married or anything.

Over the weeks, more texting happens &amp; you realize this guy actually seems great &amp; better than most guys you've met on Bumble / Hing etc.

However, the one fact that bothers you so much is that this was through a Matrimony site - and that's a tag that you don't want to be associated with, cos of course he's from the same community and all that, which perfectly suits your parents.

So just because of that one reason - should you be avoiding this lead, because it goes against your principles? Or should you be like fck it, lets just be happy we founds someone nice cos YOLO.

58,mt7w9m,1618728849,I am seeing a guy who has a problem with sex...,"I met a guy, he was cool, respectful, and interesting. One thing I liked about him was that he wasn't pushing for sex. It was such a relief. He even said he was waiting until marriage...and I liked that...even though he had sex in his last relationship. He always told me how I was beautiful, and he was so attracted to me, my body is perfect, but he would lose all his respect for me if he had sex with me (?!). He said if he really likes a girl he can't see her sexually anymore. It's two different categories for him. Also, the most he would do is hug me...he wouldn't even try to kiss me...he said he was waiting until marriage for that too because he might start something he can't finish. He said he had no self control and he would take it too far. But my thing is, he did all this in his last relationship...which was 6 months ago. They had consistent sex. 

He told me in the kind of relationship that he wants, sex is worthless. It means nothing to him. He also says he has no desire for it...but he's not asexual. He said he had a crazy sex drive but he was working on eliminating it completely so he could focus on his work. Sometimes I'll try to sexually banter with him, just make a cute joke, and he'll look at me disgusted and be like Don't do that. Is it that serious? Why is he so sexually closed-off? 

Here is my thing. He was cool and all but I really started to feel undesired and like I was hanging out with a friend. He is so adamant about the don't touch me thing that I can't tell if he has issues or if he is not attracted to me. It's so suspicious and weird. Kind of icky. It takes away from his masculinity. I'll literally just try to rub on his stomach or just cuddle and he acts like I'm going to rape him. Is he not attracted to me? Or does he have some sort of trauma?

Then there is my brother, he is 6’3, with all the traditional male attractiveness features, but he is a bartender who lives at home with our mother, he is a loser. 

Yet he still gets tons of girls while I’m a 32 year old virgin, not due to lack of trying mind you I thought that after getting rejected 100s of times it was my personality. But after seeing the latest girl my brother is dating, it finally clicked for me, looks matter more than anything and it’s pointless for me to try since all my problems are related to my genetics.

Guys I date are just so different that I cant come up with a good answer. Part of the reason seems to be that I am avoidant. I avoid conflict or if something doesnt seem to work just run away from it. Another reason is perhaps I am demisexual? I can have sex but I dont form romantic attachment. I need some time hanging out with someone to form an attachment. So the combination of both makes it really hard for me to find a ltr.

1. Lasted year and a half. Broke up because he was not acting the way I wanted and I did not have energy to tolerate nor make it work. I wanted to remain friends but he would not want it.

2. Lasted a year. With this guy, we had lots of fun but never had labels. We are still friends (he moved overseas).

3. Lasted three months. This guy was nice and caring, but too romantic. He was super kissy and cuddly, but I wasnt really feeling it. I didnt feel a lot of fun with him.

4. Lasted three months. This guy was kind of a jerk, but I liked him to some extent. We lacked communication and it wasnt really fun.

But trying to get into relationship for like last 2 months but somehow never succeeded bcz i have a problem of not being able to hold a conversation its like whenever i match with someone on dating apps or try to talk to any other girl on like any social media. I can't hold the conversation its like after hello hi and introduction there is nothing to talk about like there ia nothing in common between us bcz its either its our first chat or our interest r not aligned even if they do I'm able to hold conversation till next 2 maybe 3 chats after that there is nothing to talk about which makes it boring so i end up losing interest or girl loses interest. 

It like happened to me two uptill now like i had a girl friend in high school we used to chat for like 4-5 hrs late night daily but that went on for 7-8 days at most bcz she had really hard crush on me so she was little desperate to talk with me so i also went playing along but after 7-8 days she started to say she is getting bored when she talks to me bcz there is nothing common in between us except the thing we both like each other yeah i started to like her too but even after that we use to sat there online and try to hold conversation but after 2 maybe 3 weeks we both lost our interest and went separate way but i must say it was really nice though talking to a girl that freely without thinking that much.

So second time it was when i was in the college and covid had started there was a good looking girl in class who had a crush on me but had broken up with her last bf and got new one then corona happened then she was free during that time so we started talking then she started to play pubg with me bcz i used to love playing it so we usually went like 3-4 hrs daily voice call in pubg but same thing happened again we started to get bored after 11 days maybe 12 13 but my point is we started to get bored even this time she also said the same thing that pubg started to get Boring and whenever i started to hold a conversation there was nothing to talk about bcz we already shared a lot things like crushes, likes, interests, dreams, ppl  we had past with and some sexual interest too yeah we were somehow that close even she had a bf but a new one so she used to said that she not that serious with him right now bcz she doesn't want to break her heart again but after 2 weeks i had same problem we both lost interest and we went separate ways after that

Now I want a girlfriend desperately i held back my whole life bcz i had no money to afford one and i finally got my graduation completed and got job as software engineer so in short i have money now to afford one so I'm trying to find a good looking one gf even though i have avg looks but quite nice personality so it won't be much of a problem if we went on few dates but thing is I can't start a conversation with random girl i never met i dont know why it feels like i have no interest in her when I'm jusf desperate to get a gf with who i can share my feelings with.

So I heard many of my friends who had bf/gf saying that they talk like 4-5 hrs daily and its been 2-3 yrs in relationship. I just want to know what kind of thing i should do keep the heat up so that both of us might not lose interest ?? I just want to know r the thing u ppl do to when to talk chat or spend time with each other which keeps both of u interested?? 

Please help i really want a gf but cant get one until i know how to keep myself interested with girl for that long. Any kind of good/bad advice will really be appreciated !!!! 😊",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mt8khl/how_to_hold_conversation_more_than_a_few_chats/
68,mt8p0g,1618733265,How to get over this uncomfortable feeling of attracting younger girls?,"I’m 37 but look 25 and I mostly get looks from girls in their early 20s. I do not feel my age mostly due to me looking so young. This makes me look too young for girls from 30 and up. It happens regularly on online dating like Tinder. If I put my real age and meet girls in real life they always look a bit surprised. I seem to look older on pictures for some reason. So I feel I can not really do online dating either in this case.

But I also feel too old for girls in their 20s. Probably due to my age. However, I feel like I’m more compatible with younger girls in terms of vibes, personality.

Since I mostly get looks from girls in my 20s, I suppose that is the age range I should flirt with. Since my looks make me feel younger with girls that are 30+ but my looks make me feel more comfortable with girls in their early 20s.

Girls do not even seem to ask my age since they suppose I am 25. So sometimes they ask my age and I say 37 and they do not believe me. After a while, they seem to forget it since the visual appearance is stronger than logic.

Over the short period of time I have known him, I noticed he began to make comments that made me feel a bit off. 

Things like implying that my home is unclean (it’s always clean, I maintain it well) picks at my things “your expensive shampoo smells terrible” “your hair is sooo dry” “look at that photo of you in 2019 your hair was so healthy back then” and makes comments about how I’m only successful because of my “white pretty privilege” and that I “do the things in my job no one else wants to do” 

After I hang out with him I feel less confident in myself, which is unusual for me as I built myself up to be very confident in my own skin and life. I’m a very independent, ambitious woman who live a comfortable lifestyle due to my job. Although I feel like those attributes are a double edged sword because I get marked off as “intimidating” a lot of the time. 

I brought this issue up to him and he apologised but called me hypocritical, and then left my house and we have not spoken for a few days.

72,mt96jh,1618735833,Weird mixed signals," I was interested in one girl from my class for about 7 months before I asked her out. We had great chemistry, she would often ask me for advice and wouldn't shy away from touching my arm and being very close to me physically. We would talk irl and over messages about everything that came to our mind. She would also give me subtile compliments suggesting I was intelligent and competent. Among many signals she would give me, she asked if she could dance with me when we had to pick a dancing partner in Music class, and asked me to tie her bra when we were out swimming with a few other classmates. I also knew she talked about me to her best friend. The bra incident motivated me to ask her out on a date, because I thought she was giving me a clear signal to do so. Keep in mind she doesn't act like this with other men. She's a charismatic and radient girl, but she's also a traditional and conservative girl when it comes to relationships (she never had a boyfriend before) so I thought it was too out of her comfort zone to not be a signal. I asked her out. She declined my offer. I was disappointed and confused, but I accepted it. I just couldn't fathom I was so wrong about how she felt about me. We didn't talk for a while, not beacuse I didn't want to keep contact with her, but beceause it was a bit awkward for the both of us at the time I guess. Our interactions were brief for a few months after that and then I learned she's leaving my class to pursue a music career. I was surprised since she was the best student in the class, but I understood music was her passion, and regular class was taking to much of her time and energy. For a farwell gift I gave her a golden neckless, since it was the least I could do. She, of course, hugged me and thanked me, first in person, and later in my dms (with a lot of emojis and kind words). I didn't think much of it since she rejected me before and I took it as a friendly gesture. After that we didn't really interact that much; a few birthday wishes and instagram story replies, but not even close to what it used to be. Fast forward to a week ago, and she sent me a long message out of the blue  
''Heyy, happy Easter :) I know it's pretty random, but I'm currently studying for the finals and I must say that I still remember a lot from that time when we studied the renaissance together hahah, so I guess it was worth it 😄 ''. I sent the message to my other female friends and they say that she's definitely interested. But then again, they also said that the last time, and she rejected me. We continued that conversation dor about 4 days, but I got mostoly friendly vibes from it, not romantic. Also, even though she replied to my messages at a pretty fast rate, they were more and more shorter and dry as the conversation progressed in my opinion. I showed our convo to a few female friends to see if maybe I'm the problem, but they all confirm that I was doing a good job. I decided to start a new conversation today (I had a good reason so it didn't look forced), but I got the same dry vibe from it. I just have no idea what to think.

74,mt9c1r,1618736627,People warned me OLD is very cynical. I wasn't prepared for just how shallow people were.,"So I'm a bisexual woman. I have an average 'Becky' face but I dress very tomboyish. Besides the ravenous catcallers no decent men ever give me attention. And till now since I've been in non-lgbt spaces dating women has been impossible. In regards to preferences I also lean more towards women.

So I decide to try online dating, mostly Tinder.

At least 30% of users are bots. 

On the women's side, there's a lot of foreign students 'looking for friends' or someone to help with their English. But even a lot of the local women have on their profiles 'just looking for friends/new people'. Oh and of course 99% of them have an instagram link just to get a follow from you.

On the men's side.......I have to say that my physical attraction is equal to both sexes, but romantic preference is mostly women. A lot of the men show off with a lot of shirtless pics and make some very bold statements and assumptions on their profiles. And a lot of them STILL seem like they're mostly looking for instagram followers. 

But onto the real tea.

Talked to a girl for 2 days. She says 'You're quite the talker I see, I'll reply when I get back home cause I'm out'. And never contacts me again.

Talked to another girl for 3 weeks. She flirts a lot with me, we say good morning and good night every day. We exchange photography photos. On week 2 I make my move and ask to go on a date, and she seems enthusiastic. We delay for 1 week because of her work and the weather. Right before the day she cancels because of an 'emergency'. And then exactly an hour later admits it was an excuse and says it's because she's very shy. I worry that there's been some miscommunication since English is not her native language. I explicitly ask her if she wants to actually date me. And she replies with 'It's better if we talk here but you can message me any time', while still having the nerve to keep calling me 'dear'. Oh and of course she got me to follow her on instagram in the meantime.

I've heard of breadcrumbing, and I always vowed to never give anyone more attention if they didn't meet me halfway. This was not breadcrumbing.

75,mt9pug,1618738623,Guy Seems to Be Acting Different Suddenly,"So I’m going to try and keep this short and sweet while still giving the details. I (26F) have been talking to someone (26M) since the start of the new year. We hit things off great we match personalities, both of us saying we’re interested in each other, the mood felt right. We met online, live thousands of miles apart, discussed possibility of an actual relationship if when we met was still the same energy. Made jokes about the future and summer adventures. Then we finally started talking about meeting, got his schedule to plan around and we haven’t really talked about much of anything since. He’s just seemed distant. He still texts me every morning and throughout the day but he just seems off. I like to think I’m pretty intuitive and an empath so I know since this change I’ve also been acting off because I don’t want to overstep a boundary or drive him away. 

We hadn’t really established anything about us aside from if things didn’t work out relationship wise we both certainly wanted to be friends because we get along well and enjoy each other’s company. I wanted to talk about him coming down when and the logistics, like how long, where are you staying, are you just coming down for me, etc. so I can plan accordingly and respect whatever he wants to do. We had poked fun about being up front with one and other about if the feelings change and I were no longer wanted around to please tell me. I can take a no and I don’t want to be strung along whatsoever, I’m an adult. So I’m just kind of confused as to what’s happening right now. It kind of catapulted from getting the schedule and me making a joke about him not liking me when he came down and sent something a friend had sent to me about “I’m going to warn you like I warn all my dates I’m repulsive in person” or something like that and he played it off.

Maybe the insecurity rubbed him wrong? Maybe he’s nervous? Like certain things he’s done since I’m like “nah, were okay”, and other things in like “maybe not?” I haven’t seriously attempted to date anyone in five years by my own choice so my mind is running tbh. I don’t want to straight up ask if he’s okay or “we’re” okay because is there really a we if we’re just talking but I’d rather actually talk beyond the superficial stuff and know what’s up rather than be dragged along just because he’s “too nice” to say anything.

81,mta2u5,1618740466,"Thought it was real, but he went back to his ex.","**I apologize that this is long. If you read the entire story, thank you**

I’m a 28F, he’s a year younger than I am, and we have known each other since we were teenagers through a writing community online. We’ve kept in touch through socials, he lives states away from me but we were never anything more than just friends.

Last year in November, we met for the first time and there was an instant connection that I can’t explain.

From there, it all changed and I’ve met with him (stayed at his home for over a month) for the holidays (thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years) and could have sworn we were something. He treated me extremely well, something I was never used to from a previous 5 year relationship, and had promised me that he would treat me better and would never hurt me. I believed him because I’ve known him for a long time and thought his words were the truth.

The end of January of this year, I returned back to my state and we were keeping in touch through Discord, texting, and phone calls every single day.

But then in March he seemed to have slowly retracted and backed off from doing some specific things that I noticed instantly after days and weeks went by. He would still call me and watch anime with me over discord, but the meme sharing (we would send wholesome cute memes to each other) and Snapchat ceased and I started wondering why that is.

I’ve mentioned to him about my concerns and he would always reply to me saying it has nothing to do with me, and it’s him trying to “figure out his life” and that I’m doing absolutely nothing wrong. Fast forward to April, and I get a strange text from him saying “not to give into her” and answer him when he calls, telling me to call him an asshole and hang up. 

He later calls me after all of that explaining that he was with his ex (that he PROMISED me he would never talk to and that it was OVER before ever being involved with me) and they were at an appointment at an abortion clinic. She found out about me and physically abused him, then later found my socials and my number was given to her. I picked apart the pieces and put it all together before he fessed up to me about what he was doing the whole time he was involved with me, and I am beyond broken.

I don’t understand how you can show someone the world, but break their heart and lie to them because you can’t get over your abusive ex. I’m a very open and honest person, and thought he was the same. I wanted the best for him, and show him that he CAN be loved the correct way. But he took me for granted, and now I’m emotionally paying the price for thinking I could be there for someone that just didn’t value me the way that I thought he did.

This was the second person I’ve ever been involved with in my life, and I’m not sure I could go through something like this again. Trusting someone else is proving to be quite difficult and I can’t get over him. I feel like I lost a soulmate, and my best friend. A void I don’t think I could replace.

82,mta42v,1618740634,Religious beliefs and life goals conflicting,"My boyfriend and I were together for 3+ years. We just went on a break because he’s getting frustrated and irritated on our long arguments about marriage before moving in.

I grew up with parents who divorced too late, they dragged me through their relationship that was more of a room mate situation, but they sometimes were together for the image. Which this was for my whole adolescence, but I’m very independent and grew up “too fast” due to it. 

I’m practical, I want to move in first and then marry. It’s something I’m more comfortable with. My boyfriend doesn’t really care for it &amp; just wants to uphold the “we aren’t having premarital sex” image to his parents. However, that isn’t true, he’s the one who initiated the sexual relationship we had. He thinks it’s just a test and I don’t think he’s good enough to marry, but the truth is that he has lied and made mistakes in the relationship where I have gotten hurt. I love him, I forgive him, but the fact he had the audacity to, makes me feel uncomfortable because I would never. I grew up valuing a healthy relationship when I was around one, but I’m also cautious about how much I enable my boyfriend. 
By the time we marry, it would be the first time he would be back from school... I only get to see him 25% of the year and things are bound to be different. After all, I’m waiting for him for 5 years total of school... which i’m totally fine with. 

But i feel like i’m giving up too much getting married right after school, and he just gets so angry about it. I want to get married a little later, have kids a little later, and I want to be in a position where we can provide. 

Is it toxic for him to feel so irritated? I’ve communicated to him why I feel a particular way about things. I told him he just doesn’t accept me, he is ashamed of my religious differences with him. He hasn’t even told his parents, and I know the longer he waits the worse the outcome. They are very tight christians and I grew up where I was open to chose what I wanted. Went from Catholicism to agnostic / atheism.

He assumes his parents will not accept me, but then proceeds to correct himself later and say “they will support me and accept me”. Just that they “won’t understand our decisions” and he’s not okay with that when it comes down to it. I don’t know what he wants, just that he wants whatever his parents want for him. 

Which comes full circle and irritates me, I grew up knowing that you should focus on what you want in life. Not living up to someone else for image.. and everything he says contradicts with what I know.

At the end of the day, 
I love him. 
I have always accepted his religious beliefs despite the differences.
However, he has criticized my own and made me feel disgusting.
He tried to help me feel better, but gets angry and doesn’t know what to say majority of the time to make me feel better. I feel like a dirty secret...

I’m not sure if this relationship is worth it, what to do, I don’t know what to listen to.

90,mtatsd,1618744151,I feel like I’m too broke to date,"I live alone and basically all of my money goes on bills and learning to drive.

If I were to start dating again I can’t afford to go out for meals and drinks every week, whilst the guy usually offers to pay for me I don’t feel comfortable with that and have always split it 50/50.

I feel like if I do start talking to someone they would lose interest if I tell them I can’t afford to go out multiple times a month which is what everyone does at my age (22). I can’t even drive yet which will also cost me a fortune on taxis/public transport because where I moved to is pretty out of the way. Even if I do find someone who is cool with that I’ll still feel pretty guilty because they’ll be the one coming to me most of the time if they wanted to hang.

Maybe I should just stay single and not think about dating until I can drive but my country has a huge back log on driving tests and I’m not even guaranteed to pass first time (only available test slots are in September in my area...). I just want to go out and have some fun after being isolated for so long due to the pandemic.

92,mtb2we,1618745329,"She went from super Into me, to completely off in just one meeting!","

So i met this girl in an organization a few years ago. We hit it off pretty good. She seemed into me but i didnt act on it at the time. 1 year later i slid into her dms and we had a decent conversation but it didnt go anywhere. So i thought ok that was it, but then after 5 days of no contact she asked me out for a beer. We did. After that i tried asking her out again and she said yes, but flaked last second, she wanted alcohol or bring a gay friend. Which made it obvious for me she was nervous. This was august last year. So i gave up, but then started talking again in december, and we have talked since. Then she came over this weekend and we drank for like 9 hours and talked. We didnt even notice how fast the time was going. So she was about to leave, and ordered a taxi. She said she had to go in like 5, and then i said we have to do this first and went in for the kiss, we made out abit. And then she said she could stay over so she canceled the taxi. She slept over and we spooned and everything. In the morning and in the night prior she was literally insecure about everything, her laugh, i gave her gum in the morning, so she was like did my breathe stink, and asked if she snored etc. She blew me a kiss and left. After tho everything changed, she used longer to answer on snap and answered other people first. I said i had a great time and that ""time seems to fly by when were together"" and she said ""yeah its crazy, the time was suddenly 3 am"" Then i asked if she was free next week and she left me on opened. I tried again today to ask her if she was free next week, which she said she works the entire week, and i said we could just take a walk or something for a few hours, and she has left me on delivered, even tho shes been online and answering other people. Wtf should i do?   
Everything was perfect until she was over here, we made out, and she saw my scrawny naked body. This is what it feels to be ugly, when she obviously loved my personality.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mtb2we/she_went_from_super_into_me_to_completely_off_in/
93,mtb7n5,1618745932,Things you learn from toxic relationships,"I recently ended a relationship of 8 months with a certin girl because it was toxic. We would constantly fight, she would use her anger to manipulate me into feeling shame and guilt over a small issue that could have easily been resolved if she wanted to. She never communicated properly, my every attempt to communicate with her and resolve the issue was met with agression and disrespect. I was constantly being accused of lying over trivial things, of manipulating her when in reality... I was the one being emotionally manipulated the whole time

She was the one that broke up and looking back at our relationship I learned some very important things that I wanted to share with you people;

1. You never know you're in a toxic relationship until you're out of it

One of my best friends used to date a girl in high school that I didn't like. She would constantly disrespect him, belittle him in front of everyone. I saw that she was toxic but he didn't and it baffled me how he would endure her. My ex was simillar, but when you're ""wearing rose colored glasses"" you don't see that. You think ""this person loves me, surely he/she is not that bad, didn't mean to say that"" ect. The reality is this: if you're constantly anxious, afraid or feel bad... its bad for you, period. 

2. You can't help someone that doesn't want help

My ex is proud of herself for being ""cold"". She thinks that emotions will make you vulnerable and people will use that (even though she had no problems with expressing anger). In a healthy relationship people need to open up and be vulnerable because that's how your relationship grows. I tried to accept her and at the same time help her see that, I felt like I had that responisibility because I was her first serious partner. She saw this as manipulation and this brings me to my second point; the only person you can truly help is yourself, nobody else. It's their responsibility to work on themselves, not yours. If they ignore their problems, if they antagonize your effort, just walk away with grace and you will save yourself from even more heartache

3. Know the difference between being patient and enabling toxic behavior

In this relationship, I thought of myself as someone with a lot of patience. In reality, I never set my boundaries with this girl. I though everything would be ok if I could just love her more, give her more attention or change just one more thing about me. I was shifting my boundaries and becoming an inferior version of me everytime I did that. You need to respect yourself and set healthy boundaries because nobody else will do that for you if you don't. You need to love yourself the same way you expect others to love you. Have courage to walk away when someone doesn't respect your boundaries, it just means they choose not to treat you the way you deserve, their choice. Healthy relationships will accept that and encourage you to grow.

I have some more things but these are the most important. Knowing this girl was important to me  because it's been a life changing lesson and I am thankful for that. I hope some of you will find these advices useful",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mtb7n5/things_you_learn_from_toxic_relationships/
94,mtbg35,1618746987,"Please stop saying ""You're so special, not like other women nowadays"" or something along the lines.","It's one of the worst compliments I could ever receive.
Not only you're bashing others to uplift me, you're also assuming that other women aren't worthy nowadays, that I am the last golden specimen. Which is untrue, and you've probably said this before to someone else.

It's not flattering, it makes me think you're full of stereotypes against women.

Saying that I am not like other women, isn't the same as expressing your happiness for finding a special, unique connection. The former indicates some hidden bitterness towards my gender, the latter shows genuine gratitude and joy.

Ps: this also applies to women telling men that they're not like the rest (a bunch of fuckboys and assholes).

People who say this will often put you on a pedestal until they find out your flaws, then you'll be thrown in the ""all the other women/men"" trashcan.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mtbg35/please_stop_saying_youre_so_special_not_like/
95,mtbm6d,1618747700,Would you date a person who does not identify as any gender?,"I am genuienly curious to know.

A person could be born with the reproductive organs of a “man” or “woman”, but the person does not care about conforming to a specific gender.

Personally, I am done with the dichotomy of “man” and “woman”, and have decided to throw these labels away altogether. Thinking constantly about whether I am one or the other gave me stress because I society expects way too much, and I can’t possibly ever live up to any of that physically and mentally. I simply just wanna be me. Discussions about whether or not a person is a REAL man or REAL woman tires and bores me. If a person comes complaining about why I not manly or womanly enough, I would just tell them it’s because I am none of that. These labels are a social construct anyway, and has been twisted by society and social media in such a way that I can’t get myself to identify as either anymore.

Though, I have always been pretty much a lonewolf type of person, I have had both men and women express interest in me. I also have physical and behavioural characteristics about me that makes me kinda ambigious too I would say.

However, I have been considering whether it would be an “issue” for people if I in the future were to consider dating hence the question. I guess I just want to hear different people’s personal opinions and thoughts. :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mtbm6d/would_you_date_a_person_who_does_not_identify_as/

98,mtc4yg,1618749835,Is this a red flag?,"Hi Reddit! So a guy I am meant to be meeting for a first date has essentially said ‘if you have time you should probably book’ the place where we meet? 

Backstory: we matched on an app. We were discussing where to meet and when we could do. I’d said the area where he lives works for me, and I could do Thursday or Friday. He came back with he could do today if we were doing non alcoholic or next Saturday if we do alcoholic drinks (ignoring my availability). I said let’s do today as it’s a lovely day - where’s good round his area...he came back with a few options and the comment ‘Might be worth booking if you have time’.

Bearing in mind, I am coming to his area to meet him. I feel immediately like he can’t be that enthusiastic - do I just forget about it already and cancel the date? It *feels* like an immediate red flag to him not being enthusiastic? Thoughts and feelings please.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mtc4yg/is_this_a_red_flag/
