1,tjdbxk,1647873634,"Men with ED, what works?","I recently started dating somebody new and I really like him. We’re a great personality match, have a lot in common, and I could see this going pretty far on all of those important metrics. 
 
We had sex the other day for the first time and he had a lot of trouble getting and staying hard. Like, he would get erection and then as he put a condom on, couldn’t maintain it. He also admitted to me that he has lost his ability to ejaculate with partners, and only can do so when he masturbates. 
 
We had sex again last night and he could not develop an erection whatsoever.
 
My question is this: is there anything to be done about this? I have zero experience with it. I’m totally willing to work with him, but I’m not willing to forgo PIV intercourse in a relationship. (What I mean is, I know some people are fine to only have sex in other ways, but I am not one of them.) I just came out of a marriage with a dead bedroom for many years and sex is more important to me than it’s ever been. Is there something that we or he can do?

It seems that they feel most men don’t have much to offer when dating or in a relationship. 

These are educated, professional women — they have careers and can buy or hire for whatever they need and want. 

So it really did make me think, maybe the dating market is so difficult because most men don’t have much to offer?

I was actually friends with him first and after his death, she and I have grown closer. She didn't think she'd ever find anyone who wasn't into games and such and had about given up on men until 6 months ago when she met a man at a party. 

He's wonderful, he's funny and super friendly to her friends and family and he takes her out every night. If she needs or wants anything, he will immediately go out and get it. Anything she needs fixing, he fixes it. We've even learned not to talk about anything we want because the next day, he will go out and buy it. He hasn't pressured her for a physical relationship.  She has never had anyone treat her like a spoiled princes ever in her life (besides her father). She's so happy for the first time in years!

Last night, we were at an event and having so much fun and then she pulls out her phone showing off what she looked like 20 years ago when she was thin and younger. She is always putting her looks down but loves to show off what she used to look like about 20 years ago. She gets very sad seeing what she used to look like before aging and weight gain and I always tell her none of us look like we did 20 years ago but she's still attractive. 

After we all went home, she started texting me saying how hurt she was by something he said and was thinking about calling their relationship off. I asked her what he said and she said that he told her that he 'liked her like that' referring to the old picture. That's pretty much what EVERYBODY says when they see those old pictures! She was asking for a compliment and got the compliment she was begging for and now she's upset???? Was what he said really THAT bad. Sure, he could have worded it differently but I know what he meant. I'm not sure what her interpretation is.

9,tjnn87,1647901174,Any advice is appreciated...,"I've just come out of a 7-month relationship where we have declared love for each other, introduced our children, but unfortunately, she recently ended it (3 weeks ago). 

I'm not looking to get back together with her, but I have some questions which I was hoping to get some guidance on. So, for context - she has told me she loves me earlier this year and recently said how lucky she feels, and she would never find another person like me and I make her feel safe, loved and special. 

About 2 months into the relationship, she ended it due to the limited time we have with each other but came back and we worked it out. She admitted that she unintentionally self-sabotaged things and quoted it was like 'an imposter syndrome thing' Around a 6 weeks ago she reacted to a lot of stress in her life at home, work but nothing to do with our relationship but ultimately started to fade on me over a week until I asked her about it. She dismissed this and said we were fine, but this surfaced again a few days later when (after a few drinks) she got upset and said this isn't fair on me. She still was unable to tell me what or why she was thinking this. I assume she was holding back.

She has previously said how her last relationships were with people that didn't treat her very well and at first, she ignored the red flags. She has said before that she doesn't see any red flags with me.

The relationship was ended over text stating that she knows that she hasn't communicated well, and there are too many issues cropping up mostly on her part or because of her and the blame is not on me. She said that she has been yo yo-ing again and she's not going to put me through that.  I haven't been able to talk to her about it to understand what she's going through.

So, my questions: 

1. Does this reveal a certain attachment type to you?
2. What do you think the 'issues' are? 

I'm the sort of person where if I have found someone who I though was amazing then I would do what I must do to keep them. Those people are rare.

The other day we were talking (at an event we were both attending), and he was flirting with me, or being friendly, I don’t know anymore and suddenly he  blurted out, “how old are you?” And when I said 49 he looked mortified and said “wow I can’t believe it you look so good for your age.” Then he said wow, “I’ll be dead by the time I’m your age.” I asked how old he was. He said 39. I said why will you be dead 10 years from now? 

I walked away after these comments, it was not entertaining to me; and I never heard from him again. 

I guess we both figured we were each very close to the same age I thought he was older and he thought I was younger. 

But. Sheesh. I didn’t know 49/50 was a death sentence to men. 

It took me a beat to shake that one off, and I’m pretty arrogant and look very good for any age over 35. So that was harsh.

I’m finding that I will have 2-4 dates and there just isn’t that momentum, spark or connection on my end. 

I’m finding if there is mutual attraction, the man is looking for something sexually focused and they start to suggest their house or something sexually oriented as a second or third date. I find this really disheartening as I’m not ready to be physically intimate with someone until I’ve established emotional intimacy and some form of commitment. 

I’ve asked for feedback from the guys I’ve really liked and most of the time they’ve said it wasn’t anything about me. They are looking for something else or they have their own issues to work on

I‘ve been seeing my (41M) man for 5 months and I know I like him a lot. He’s kind, extremely supportive and really is everything I could possibly want in a partner.  

I am very conscious that I do not want to be in a relationship that isn’t going anywhere. I would rather be alone than be in a relationship that is just passing the time. I value the relationship I have with myself a lot, and I do not feel like I need to be with anyone. 

Because of this, I’m keen to know if our relationship could progress. But I don’t think it’s possible to know whether it could progress until he meets my family and of course my children. 

There are some upcoming events that I feel make this more of a pressing issue:

- Family coming down for dinner next month, great opportunity for him to meet the family but as it stands he can’t come because he hasn’t met my children.
- I’m starting a new job next month and will be able to spend far less time with him, unless he meets my children. 
- My sister and I are planning a holiday for my milestone birthday in the Summer, would be great to ask him along but given he hasn’t met any family yet this doesn’t feel like an option. 

He has two adult children and my two children are 8 and 12.

So here is the narrative: A guy contacted me in December on Facebook, we had a mutual friend. I wasn’t really looking for a relationship but he was really fun to chat with. We hit it off quickly, met, and proceeded with getting know each other. Since Christmas we had spent every evening/night together. There was a few reddish flags that I noticed but nothing like a deal-breaker. Things flipped 180 degrees in the end of February. Russia invaded Ukraine. Here is the thing: I am Ukrainian, I am from Donetsk, I’ve lived the same nightmare in 2014 when my family, my friends, and my city was under a massive bombing. And now again, but my whole country. I basically fell out of this life. I couldn’t really eat or sleep for the first few weeks. I am all there, mentally and emotionally. I am with my people. My heart is bleeding. I also work in immigration and 90% of our clients are Russians/Ukrainians. The stress from work has been overwhelming, I can’t even describe. At the end of the day all I wanted was to hug my toddler and be grateful he is happy and healthy. Now back my partner: he was Russian. And his view on this war is exactly as all “zombies” say: Russia is liberating Ukraine from Nazis. He would come to my house seeing me devastated and would say things like: Putin is awesome! Go Russia! 
I asked him so many time wtf he was doing and why. We agreed then not to discuss politics but knowing he basically supported that politics my attraction and affection towards him went to a ground zero pretty much. Aside from me not being able to invest in the relationship at all at this crazy time. Like he doesn’t understand that I am UNABLE to enjoy life when my friends and my family is there right now. I just…can’t. He was unable to understand. I was told I am in the hysterics of the war and enjoying this suffering. 
I tried to be open and clear as much as I could and I said I had no hard feelings for him and I understand his choice. But I also have the right to make my own choice and if he is unable to wait or support me then I don’t see how this can work. He childishly blocked me even though I still have his staff and a key from his place. I know he is hurt, but so am I. But what would you do? How to be in a relationship like that? I’ve heard that a 3 months mark is where people see the differences in values and often end things.

I want to make sure boundaries/expectations are set, be kind and intentional, but let her know I'm hella excited and soo interested in where things are going...all with the understanding there needs to be a progression and not rushing.


I'm early 40s M, she's late 30s, had a coffee date and I swear it was the most comfortable, easy first date from OLD I've ever had. I hear stories of people saying it's like they've known the person for years upon first meeting, and I would have never thought it possible. I stand corrected.

We've been on a handful of dates, all terrific. On one date she mentioned that she tends to go all in, and realizing I have the same tendency, I want to be cognizant of that. Especially since I know we're on the same page so far about enjoying each other's company and spending time with one another. It'd be super easy at this point to line up 3 evenings a week, and a long weekend here and there.

I don't want to rush this, but I am invested. And I want her to know I'm invested (handful of dates, really see where this goes, invested). Maybe my fear is if she's usually ""all in"" and I'm trying to be intentional about slowing things down, I don't want her to feel like I'm playing a hand, or she's not a priority. I stopped every single other dating match I had after our second date.

So, with the hive mind here, how do I make her know I'm ""in"" without moving too quickly? God forbid I just tell her I really like her, understand we can let things progress naturally, and communicate openly.

38,tkp34e,1648023083,I feel foolish.,"Urgh… Had a couple of dates with a guy. I really, really liked him. We got on, laughed a lot, had stuff in common etc etc.

Here’s the thing: he didn’t really look like his online pics (turns out they’re all a few years old) and I’m not convinced he was the height he claimed to be.

Nonetheless I overlooked these things (because I’m an idiot!).

Anyway, after a couple of days of silence (we’re not big texters) he texts to say we clicked, we had fun but he didn’t feel the chemistry or spark.

Cool! I wrote a polite message back and line drawn.

But here’s the thing: I didn’t fancy him. I really liked him as person, enjoyed our time together and thought he had a handsome face.

However physically he wasn’t my type. But (!) I was so swept away but how much we got on, I ignored the fact that I just couldn’t see myself being physical with him.

So why do I feel foolish? 

Because why was I even entertaining the idea of dating someone I couldn’t see myself kissing yet alone wanting to sleep with?

He just seemed like such a lovely man and after so many dates with horrible and/or inarticulate men, I was convinced this could work.

Even after the first date I kept on going over how different he was in the flesh and I just couldn’t see how it could work physically but I somehow thought the spark could come because we liked each other as friends.

Now I’m sitting here trying to work out how I got dumped by a guy I didn’t fancy and I feel kind of stupid really.

The thing is: even before his text I found myself thinking how little I thought about him. How there were no butterflies but just a gentle affectionate warmth.

I feel he did us both a massive favour but it’s definitely raised an alarm bell in me.

Have I just become so desperate I’d entertain dating a guy I don’t fancy just because he’s nice? 😬

I initially discarded this email, after half year I was curious and we met up and hit it off from the start. We have been together since. I introduced my kids (12&amp;9) slowly to him and things are going well. In autumn 2021 we decided we wanted to live together and we should try this out for half a year. He kept his appartement and he moved into my house because my kids are still living with me. Once in a while we/I checked on the kids how they perceived the living arrangement and no complaints from them on that part. The half year had passed and we (also the kids had a say in it)want to live together permanently. As we both had to give up a lot after our last relationship and we both had to start new, we want to draw up a contract. In order to have him move into the house we need to rebuild/invest for about 10k. The house will be shared equally (renting contract also in his name), but in case we break up he will move out because the kids need a stable living arrangement. Also the house is family owned, I rent it from my family and it will be passed to family if I die or move. There is also a possibility that I can buy the house from my family (together with my partner). Buying the house together is to early in the relationship/process for me. The investments will not be lost if I decide I want to move as it will stay in the family.  I already invested a lot of money into the house,about 35k, before we ever met. So he wants to invest 10 k. He really likes rebuilding, so he will do this all by himself. In the end, if I would hire a contractor the cost would be doubled/ trippled probably. In the contract we want to state that if in the unfortunately event we break up, he gets his 10 k investment back. I agree with this. My family doesn't as I already put in the 35k and he profits from the rebuilds. In the end, he won't own the house only if we buy it. I think he takes a big risk and he needs money to rebuild if we end things. Right now I'm sure this won't ever happen, but never say never. For both of us we had to start from scratch. I don't want to experience that ever again. If we break up I probably have to give him all my savings, but have the house and can save up again. Not a favourable position but liveable.  I would like to hear the opinion of strangers, who also had to start over.

but having said that, don’t give up hope. it’ll signal the death-knell. it will be evident. it will hover about you like a scent that will drive the healthy away. you are worth loving. you are serious about giving yourself to the right person. you are ready to share your happiness and to receive theirs; that’s attractive. 

start by not being concerned about what they think of you but about what you think of them. if you do the former you’ll be tempted to subtly change who you are to accommodate. that’s not what you need as they might fall in love with the façade. that’s not you and you need to be loved, accepted. be you so they can love you. 

don’t be too afraid. bravery has nothing to do with the absence of fear but rather the mastery of fear. you are going to get hurt no matter what happens. if you find a person that you happily live with till the end then that end will devastate you. you are headed for a hurt that might destroy you in the best case so don’t worry about the “worst case”; that’s the easy scenario. be brave. 

know yourself and your needs. what’s your attachment style? what’s your love language? seek people that can see you; your needs. win-win situations are what will be sustainable. and, please, do not do anything you don’t want to. if you do that you will resent. if you can’t see your joy in what you do don’t do it. there is no return on an investment. that’s not love that’s a transaction. 

your happiness is your responsibility. again, be happy in and of yourself. if you look to another to make you happy you will be let down. you will also put an unfair burden on the object of your affection. you’re looking to share—magnify— your happiness with them and they with you.

I was so excited when we matched because we have a ton of common interests and are aligned on all of my self-identified important issues. We have been on 6 dates and had an amazing time on all of them. He has been divorced for 4 years but I am only the second person he has gone out with since. I get the feeling that it was a messy divorce and he commented that he spent quite a bit of time after his divorce working on himself and focusing on his kids (all teens by now) and was now in a place to start dating again. 

On date #5 we had somewhat of a DTR conversation when I asked what he was looking for in a potential partner. He said that he wasn't sure but felt really bad because although he really enjoyed spending time with me he felt that he needed to date other people in order to figure out what he was looking for. I was more than ok with this, especially after only 5 dates, and told him such. So far, our only physical contact has been hand holding, hugs, and kisses on the cheek, all of which he initiated. The DTR chat was toward the end of our date and things seemed fine so I was planning on asking for a kiss goodnight if he didn't go for it. As we hugged goodbye he leaned in and I thought he was going to kiss me, instead he kissed me on the forehead. I was sure that the forehead kiss coupled with the dating other people comment meant that he wasn't interested anymore but the next day we continued chatting as usual and went out again earlier this week (ended with a hug and kiss on the cheek).

I really like him, and I think there could be LTR potential here but I am used to guys moving a bit faster than this, especially physically. Should I be patient and give it a while longer?

2) This may sound immature, but I kind of feel like she's being a bit paranoid in the sense of: She's vaxxed, I had a negative weekly test from work, the date is outside, and if she went anywhere in the general public within the past few days, there's a much higher chance she was exposed to it compared to just sitting down with me on a park bench for an hour sipping coffee.

I actually really enjoyed the casual and fun aspect to what we had. I don’t care about labels or further investment aside from being exclusive. He is very affectionate when we get together. I’d be very happy for things to stay exactly as they were, as long as we are exclusive. 

The reasons he said he preferred casual all involved him being busy and having a lot going on in his own life. I’m not blind to the fact he probably wouldn’t offer up anything about seeing other people without directly being asked and there is a good chance he is.

At that time I was feeling a little frustrated with the trajectory of our relationship and I didn't disagree at all. When she suggested when we be friends, my first reaction was to say no I have plenty of friends. And she got really upset so I ended up going along with it. We've met up like twice in the 4 or 5 months since then for meals and texted each other a little bit here and there, going weeks or a month in between sessions. Since we called things off I've been actively dating and have slept with multiple one other women, but since we called things off she is the only person that I have not wanted to date other people with, ever and she's still in my head I'm conflicted between a part of me that wants to never return her calls or texts ever again because I'm a little bit mad at her because of how she ended things, because I really do like her. She texted me late last night and through today, but she's also suggesting we shouldn't get together cuz she's really busy with a problematic home buying transaction that she has.

I'm mainly looking for opinions from women, but men are of course welcome to comment, too.

Let's say we strike up a conversation, get along well, and you even agree to a date. If the subject of past relationships were to come up, and I said I basically never had one, or even told a white lie and said I've never been in an LTR, would that put the kibosh on things?

Let's go a little further. Say we've been dating a while, we go back to my place one night, and things start to get intimate. Now, I've debated a few times with myself on whether or not I'll just fumble my way through and not say anything. But let's assume I'm feeling particularly honest or vulnerable that night, and I say I've never done this before. Would you grab your stuff and head for the hills?

I just feel really, really hopeless at this point. I'm trying to stay positive; I'm putting myself out there, trying new things, and trying to be bolder than I ever have been in my entire life up to this point, but every time I sit down and think about all of the roadblocks I'm going to have to overcome, I get discouraged. It just seems like I'm impossibly behind in all of this, and with no real way of catching up.

I'm also still clueless on how to even find somebody. While I'm being more social and outgoing at work (I would never date a co-worker anyway, though) and all of my normal haunts, even when I see an attractive woman, I have no idea how to approach her, or even if I should. I'm not a bar or a club guy either, so those are both no-go areas for me. If anybody could give me some tips on this (minus OLD; I'm not interested in that route at all), I'd really appreciate it. Some of my friends at work suggested [meetup.com](https://meetup.com), but my area must suck for this, because everything I see on there is like card games and trail-walking for people 50+.

56,tljjrt,1648076163,My life on the internet dating scene (kind of a rant),"49m

Having been on online dating for the better part of two years has been very much a rollercoaster. I have been out of the game (married) for 12yrs, taking 2 years off to work on myself (therapy) and then moving to metropolitan area in the midwest, I have found the challenges of being a man with two youngish children, divorced, appears to be a very low percentage success rate.

Over the past two years I may have been on 50 dates between Hinge, Bumble, Match, Tinder, and even Facebook dating. Of those two years I dated two people with significant potential but unfortunately both of those ended up being, in the long run (red flags), a challenge.

50 dates sounds like a lot but to put it in context, of the 48 dates that were more or less ""one and done,"" a significant amount of them I wouldn't have gone on if I had met them in real life for various different reasons (some because of deceptive practices). 

I don't expect everyone I like to like me and overall, based on my experience who knows if any of those would have amounted to anything? You don't really get a sense of people until you talk or meet. I could have done a better job vetting a date by setting up video calls or just voice, but I tend to believe most people are decent and have honest intentions.

Some of those dates didn't work out because there was clearly something about me that didn't translate well for them to consider a next date. Maybe I had misrepresented myself (I don't think I have) but from their perception maybe they thought they were meeting someone else?

I have had sex with a few of these dates on the first night. Some of them definitely caught me off guard as in while talking to them I wasn't expecting them to make advances. Some we may have drank a little too much. Some perhaps we were just lonely. I have learned that meaningless sex doesn't work for me as I am nearing 50. This might have been fun in my 20s-30s but oddly enough I am actually looking for a long term relationship, whether that is a life partner or marriage. Also there is something off about one night stands with someone off the internet. It feels more like an interview for a booty call, where if I were out and about there is some excitement about meeting someone random, joking around, and the build up of taking a chance. 

What's Worked for Me:

* Online dating is a long game. If you delete your profile over and over you're taken out of the queue of someone else who is also going through a series of dates to find the right one
* Current pictures, being honest about my age and height, being upfront about my family situation and my availability
* Being myself,  being patient, being mindful that the woman on the other end is enduring a shit show of suitors who some may have been abusive during chats/dates that didn't work out
* Therapy: I have benefitted from working on myself and I believe it reflects well in my personality and how I converse with women online

What hasn't worked for me:

* Not being more thorough in my vetting practices. Some women are sneaky out there. It's odd at our age (+40)
* Not sticking with my preferences. Ladies I get it, you're 5'2"" but you want 6""+ men. You want what you want and it's easier to stick with that in online dating
   * Sure you might meet someone in real life who doesn't entirely fit the mold and it works out, but this is online dating. Setting standards matters
* Getting emotionally attached to someone I haven't met yet. I am definitely a hopeless romantic in the purest form. I sometimes get ahead of myself. It sucks

Apps that have worked for me:

* Match = est 25 dates = 2 short term relationships
* Hinge - est 10 dates

57,tlvryn,1648089878,Anyone else drowning in matches now that everyone is remote?,"I don’t know if it’s the area I’m in or what but I just started online dating again after like a year hiatus.  This time I sprung for the paid version to spare myself all the unnecessary swiping and get straight to people that like me.  Well I’ve had the app now for a few days and have almost 3,000 matches, this is WITH my criteria set on everything.  I don’t even live in a city.  This is just insane, how am I ever going to get through all of them.  Has anyone else seen a big spike like this??",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/tlvryn/anyone_else_drowning_in_matches_now_that_everyone/

He signed off by saying it was nice chatting with me then added this “😘”. I’m all for emojis, I use them all the time but this one just seems a like a very strong choice.  (I’m not a prude. I have no problem kissing on a good first date) am I being ridiculous?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/tm85k5/kissing_emoji_am_i_overreacting/
60,tma60i,1648128573,The 15 minute Ghost -- Rude or A Sign of the Times?,"Tldr; Within the span of 5 hours, we matched, met, I bought and got ghosted and I am annoyed

I (49M) matched with a 40 year old woman yesterday. Both educated and professional. I am divorced with a kindergartner. She has never been married, no kids.

We exchanged two messages in the late afternoon and then about 7:25 pm, she messages and says she's coming back from dinner with a girlfriend would I like to grab a drink? I am normally a planned out person, but I decided to be spontaneous. We met in the bar at a high-end restaurant 35 minutes later.

It was okay chit chat. Not a spark, but it wasn't awful. We talked for 2 hours. The bill comes, I pick up her two glasses of wine, my two glasses of wine and the salad I ate. The bill was placed in between us. She never even feigned an attempt to split it. It was $82 and I tipped to an even $100.

We leave -- her Uber had arrived and I walked to my car. No attempted half-hug on either of our sides. I just said, ""talk soon.""

Literally 12 minutes later, by the time I get home, she had unmatched. 

I am pissed. Should I be? If I impromptu come out and buy your drinks isn't that at least meritorious of a message saying,  ""thanks for the wine. I didn't feel much chemistry, but you seem like a great person. Good luck on your journey?""

Am I being overly idealistic? For context, this is the first time this has happened to me and I have a good amount of dating experience over the last 4 years. Her behavior of watching me pay for drinks and then ghosting almost immediately just seems incredibly low class.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/tma60i/the_15_minute_ghost_rude_or_a_sign_of_the_times/
