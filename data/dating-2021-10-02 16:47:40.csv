0,q04cn9,1633211796,is this ACTUALLY going somewhere?,"there's this guy i came to know three months, we go to the same college, and have the same taste in music/films, we also have loads of classes in common too, such eerie similarity caused us to believe we are somewhat each other's twin, anyways ever since offline sessions began, we have been hanging out together, along with this one girl, we talk about philosophical and emotional stuff with some recommendations here and there sometimes, which i honestly don't think is a good way to go, within the span of 2-3 weeks, we have exchanged jackets, smoked together, told each other almost the entire life story of ourselves, and loads of adult jokes, i must say, i don't think we are compatible since he has never laughed with me as he does with the other girl, who has a similar sense of humour and etc. (there's more to add) (ps: this gives such olivia rodrigo vibes lmao)

Ofc, I don’t look like a model. But I’m 6’3 and I’ve been working out for years, in order to feel better with my physique. I’m always been pretty sporty tho, so I’ve never had physical insecurities.

I know she had a crush on me for about 3 years, but i didn’t like her back. She never told me about it, but it was kinda noticeable. She then got to know a guy and they got together. But she’s started to show a more intense physical contact with me and she’s kind of jealous when she hears about other girls i talk about ( not romantically ).

So, I’ve always been his close friend. But I don’t know if she feels something for me. 

Yesterday, I went to a party of a classmate of us. But she couldn’t come because her boyfriend was coming to visit her. Eventually, they argued and she got mad at him. She told me about this but didn’t want me to tell about it to my classmates ofc.

But when its him he doesn’t seem to get it or want to do it. His communication is tearing us apart. He says he will work on it. But It never improves that much. Then he says he doesn’t know if he will ever change. Then right after tells me he will. It’s always back and forth. Then he gets upset with me when I have trouble trusting things will change. But he constantly goes back and forth on it. He is so hard to communicate with!!! I tell him over and over again exactly what I want to see happen. Yet he will still ask me what I want him to do.

Anyways, here's my type (don't judge until you reach the end):

\- MAN OF GOD (goes to church and has friends that share his faith ""iron sharpens iron"")

\- Kind, compassionate, and selfless

\- Respectful and is a good listener

\- PATIENT! (I can be SLIGHTLY insecure and overthink at times! it's not entirely bad tho) 

\- Romantic

\- Mature

\- Lives alone with a nicely clean home 

\- No video games (a little bit is fine! BUT if you are bordering ""I want to be a pro gamer"" then nope)

\- Older than me (this is actually not even that important at this point)

\- Tall (5'11 and up)

\- First Responder/Military 

\- Fit! (Bonus points with you got abs... but I honestly only will ever care about FOREARMS)

\- Dominant: able to LEAD and PROTECT 

\- Attractive (to me.) 

With ALL that being said, I have determined that there are no men like that out there anymore... that is single! Like okay MAYYYBBBBEEEEE I'm asking for too much but like we are all entitled to a ""type"". Regardless! 

I have decided to be the man I guess I will never meet... NOT gonna get a sex change but hey! I can be all tough and tactically.. too. I'm definitely more feminine and soft spoken, but I am so sick of waiting for a MAN to appear. 

So I am officially giving up and here's what I'm going to do:

\- Get my gun license and practice until I'm really good at it! (I think it'll be pretty cool)

\- I'm going to study to be a paramedic! (I'm in pre-nursing now)

\- I am going to enlist and serve my country (I'm asian... but I was born and raised here...)

\- I'm gonna start working out and MAYBE i can be a Firefighter/Paramedic

\- I will continue working on my faith to be a woman of God and not just a christian! 

\- Will continue wearing my sundresses and skinny jeans... I'm not trashing my femininity

\- I might as well stay single too. 

Here's to 60 more years of life... -.- (I'm 23... hoping to die by 83 or sooner)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q088tm/this_is_where_i_am_with_dating_disappointed/

So I’m currently in only a 4 month relationship but at the start of it she talked a lot about her past sexual relationships (one night stand, FWB’s and her ex) as if I was comfortable with it. I should of brought up how upset it made me when she talked about that stuff sooner but Instead I acted like I didn’t care. 

Now I randomly think about her with other guys and it makes me sad, like this morning I woke up and the first thing I thought of was her with another guy. It’s like I’m scarred by her past and I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s unhealthy because when I get sad I go quite and in a bad mood which then affects our relationship.

45,q08r1m,1633227700,I (25 f) think I’m going to ask this guy (25 m) that I’ve known for a while out.,"I’m (25 f) going to ask a guy (25 m) out. I think at first I’m going to just ask if he’s like to get lunch with me. I’d like to get a feeling of whether or not he’s interested in me as more than a friend.

Here’s our deal. I’ve known him now for almost two years. The first time I met him was ad a New Years party on New Year’s Eve of 2019. He happens to be my sister’s best friend’s brother. We were introduced, he was funny and I thought he was an attractive guy but at the time we both were dating other people.

I’ve seen him a few times over the course of the last couple years. Usually at a party or a night out with a group of people. He’s always been pretty laid back. I think he might be a little shy and maybe awkward in large groups but he’s pretty funny when he gets to know you.

A few times I’ve actually hung out with him when it’s only a small group and he’s seems way more comfortable. He’s more talkative and I got to know him just a bit better. He seems really like a good guy but until last November I was in a relationship. 

Then in July of this year I started to see him fairly regularly at my job. He’s a mail carrier and he happened to get assigned to the route that delivers to my job. I work at a veterinary clinic. So I’ve seen him maybe a couple times a week since then. A few of the other girls at work have commented that they think he’s really cute. And I have to admit he looks good in his uniform! He always wears a polo shirt and he has these big shoulders and is stocky but not muscular and he’s got the sexiest sleeve tattoos on his arms.

So Friday when I saw him and he smiled and said hi I just realized that I’m a dummy for not asking him out already! I talked to my sister today and found out that he is single my sister of course knew right away that I was asking for myself so she texted her friend. Who then texted me and said go for it! She said her brother is a sweet guy and he once told her that he thought I was really pretty.

So the first day I actually get to see him this week I’m going to ask him if he’d like to go to lunch my treat some time. I’m going to say  “Hey I think you’re pretty great and I’d like to get to know you better. Would you like to maybe grab lunch some day? I’m buying.”

What does everyone think of this plan? I feel like even if he’s not interested and he lets me down it still won’t be awkward because I can always make sure I’m not at the front desk when he comes to deliver the mail. Plus it’s not like we see each other all that much outside of work so if it does t work out it’s not like a close friendship will be messed up.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q08r1m/i_25_f_think_im_going_to_ask_this_guy_25_m_that/

He reassured me that nothing happened and that he would cut it off with her and say he's busy if she's in town next time.

I’m addition, I couldn’t figure out why the people I was attracting were also insecure and not in the best place, at least mentally and emotionally. This last talking stage made a pretty big impact on and sort of catapulted me into finally addressing my own insecurities and traumas. It was also hurtful, not because the person ghosted me without a final explanation but because I was left to also see how I subconsciously would fall into toxic, often one sided situations and was projecting a lot. Fast forward, I was curious about what the dating world is looking like now since I’ve made time to heal and work on myself so I made a dating profile and low and behold, I run into the guy that ghosted me on there. I panicked and ended up deleting my account out of fear of him seeing me. This was a couple days ago and while I can’t say I am sad about it, I just feel empty and just discouraged with dating in general.

Not only am I surrounded by beautiful women here, I have no issues talking to them either. But it never seems to go anywhere. An insanely gorgeous girl just stared me in the eyes today and sang “you were Romeo and I was Juliet” and I still couldn’t make anything happen after that. 

I’m not one for small talk, I will say that. But do I really have to become a salesman and change my personality just to get something going with a girl at all? Like isn’t my real personality enough? I see guys who are not dedicated to their lives or self improvement and are probably less attractive than me with beautiful girls all the time and I just don’t understand why I can’t manage to find one. Maybe my personality is extremely niche, maybe I’m bad vibes or boring? Idk.

80,q0azqh,1633236725,Gym crush - can I get an outside opinion?," Alright, so this is about a gym crush, and I *think* that what I’m asking for is to be disabused of some wishful thinking- I would appreciate another couple pairs of eyes on this. This is going to be a lot of inference based off of eye contact, so feel free to tell me I’m in fantasy land. This is all extremely embarrassing.

So, there’s this absolute facemelter at my gym- I see her a couple of times a week at lunch-ish. I *think (pretty confident)* we’ve been playing eye-footsies for a few months. I’m a little shy about approaching girls in the first place, but especially so at the gym… I don’t want to corner someone who isn’t interested. But- I really dig her vibe, and she seems to be consistently holding eye contact for a couple extra beats. Had she not been doing so, I would have stopped looking her way. 

She sometimes seems to end up in my corner of the gym…. maybe more than chance would indicate, but her eyes always find a wall when I’m walking by… so, that’s either ‘not interested’ or nervous, but she's not actively avoiding me... I guess that's something. Wasn’t going to push it, even though I was starting to get a crush. As I said- really like her vibe.

Anyway, I started seeing her less frequently… but there she was, one day this week- I’m a bit out of breath from whatever I was doing, and not expecting to see her: then, we’re walking towards/past each other, and there’s a total eye-lock (accidentally on my part, jaw half-way to the floor) and we both just sort of hold it… long hold. Both making the same slightly surprised (read: stupid) face. Then, a second and a half later, I come to my senses and realize I should probably smile, but of course at that point it’s too late. Fine.

So- I think to myself, ‘that seemed…. auspicious.’ A few minutes later I’m by the ‘paper towels and disinfectant-spray’ station, and I throw a look her way, and what I got back was… more than eye-footsies. I would have bet a month’s salary it was an ‘I’m interested’ look. This is about a full ‘one-one thousand’ of eye contact from 10-15 feet, and if I were to add any qualitative modifiers to that last part, they would have to involve sex. If those weren’t sexy eyes, I may have completely lost my touch at reading faces. Which could very well be the case. Should have smiled, should have walked over, but I was just kind of stunned. Haven't had a girl look at me like that in... a while. \*The other reading of this would be she was trying to mean-mug me, and doing a very sexy, very bad job of it. She does have fierce eyes, but even in retrospect, with the full weight of subsequent events upon me, it doesn’t seem all that likely. 

Anyway, she’s there again the other day- made a little eye contact when I come in. I think I'm not deluding myself when I say that she looks up from across the gym and looks right at me. She walks toward the dumbbell area and I turn toward her and try to smile- she’s already moving across, but she would’ve been able to tell I was making a (weak) attempt. I think. I'm really, really bad at this. 

I'm a bit discouraged, having thought that this was going to be a cake-walk after that last thing. Decide to go ahead and wing it- put my stuff at the bench next to her- of course my backpack dislodges my music player, which goes flying, so I look like a clumsy asshole… I go capering around to recover it. As this is happening, she *immediately* bounces. Gets right-the-fuck out of there. I play it off like I was actually there to do some exercise, fooling absolutely nobody.

So whatever I thought up until that moment, my read is: this is ‘all she wrote.’ There’s no misreading taking off as-fast-as-possible when I try to come talk to her. I feel really gross that I was maybe making  (modestly aggressive) eye contact which *I* thought was affectionate, but was actually making her uncomfortable. But, like, I don’t hold eye contact with people I’m not interested in… and girls that aren’t interested in me don’t hold eye contact either. I feel like that’s just a natural response.

So- give me some hard truths. Tell me I’m out my melon.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/q0azqh/gym_crush_can_i_get_an_outside_opinion/
81,q0b1vm,1633237002,want to stop seeing someone,"There was a woman who I used to work with years ago when I worked retail. I was going to school, moved on and got a salaried job and she stayed in that world and we lost touch.

During the pandemic, she adopted a puppy and I love puppies and she remembered that and reached out. Pandemic times were weird, so I started visiting her and the puppy almost weekly. She was laid off but getting the federal unemployment bonus and I was working my salaried job remotely and kinda envied her free time.

Then the world got more, back to normal and I got a new, better job and she hasn't worked at all. She doesn't have a car and doesn't really do much and it is clearly showing.

I invited her out with another friend to a party and my friend told me he thought she was off and maybe on the spectrum. I just feel like she's ""a bit much"" but mostly that she lost some sense of social norms during the pandemic.

My friend with the puppy is clearly is not a part of society anymore. She has a sweet deal and doesn't really have rent to pay, she's not well adjusted anymore and it's more apparent than ever. I tell her to get a job and meet new people but she doesn't.

I feel like it was a ""pandemic"" friendship and I'm ready to move on, but feel bad because she needs help and some ""successful"" people in her life to give her advice, but I'm tired of telling her to do things.

I'm very busy and somewhat social and I don't need a project anymore.

Can I just move on without being a terrible person?
