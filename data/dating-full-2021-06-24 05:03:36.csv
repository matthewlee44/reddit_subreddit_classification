I met ""Mike"" four years ago in graduate school because we run in similar circles. We hung out a bunch, and I confessed I had feelings for him, and he let me down easy. Neither of us were in a good place at the time. 

We drifted apart, I got over him, but we reconnected during quarantine. We actually addressed that awkward fact that I had told him that I liked him years prior, but I told him I was over it, which was true at the time. He and I have gotten very close, far far closer than when we were friends a few years ago, texting for a couple of hours nearly every day and hanging out roughly 2-3 times a month for probably 4-5 hours at a time. 

I've started to fall for him again. My problem is that I don't know how to handle this situation or how to interpret what is going on. We are both age 26. 

*Signs I'm just a good friend:*

1) He has several long term platonic heterosexual/bisexual female friends, which is a green flag for me because he doesn't see women as purely sexual objects but rather as real human beings.  I also don't know his female friends very well (our two friends in common are both gay men), so I don't know how often he talks to his other female friends compared to me. 

2) We don't touch, beyond maybe a quick swat of the arm. Unclear if this is due to Covid or because he doesn't want to break the touch barrier with me.

3) He doesn't pay for anything when we hang out. This is fine, I'd prefer to pay for myself, but I know that this can be a clear sign of a man's intentions. 

*Signs there could be something there:*

1) He initiates conversation/hanging out \~50% of the time. He's very respectful, always on time, and genuinely listens to me and asks me questions about me and my life, and recommends things he thinks I might like. We vibe EXTREMELY well and can talk without any awkward pauses for hours. 

2) He often continues our conversations via text even after they could easily end (I do the same tbh)

3) His body language is always pointed towards me. 

4) His previous relationships were with female friends he had known for 1-3 years. 

I really really love being his friend, and honestly, I don't see myself saying I like him again. I'd rather remain platonic friends with him than risk losing the friendship entirely.

I met a girl online (Hinge) in early May, and we really hit it off. I'm very independent in general, and don't date too often. I haven't EVER connected this well with ANY of the girls I've dated in the past, and it feels very different (in a good way). Not only do we have a ton of hobbies/interests in common, but we get along so great. She's very attractive too.

We talked online for weeks before she even felt comfortable giving me her number. When I got it, we would talk daily. She told me that she likes to move slow, and that she's very picky/selective about guys that she’ll talk to. This didn't really bother me, and I took it as a challenge.

Our first date was insanely great. She drove two hours from her place to mine. We went out to dinner, drank some great wine, had lots of laughs and great conversation, etc. Though, later in the evening, she told me that she had to ""confess something"", and that she wanted to wait until later in the date, as she ""didn't want to scare me away just yet"".

After we got back from dinner, she took me out to her car, opened the trunk, and showed me a suitcase full of BDSM/sex toys. She told me how much she enjoys sex and other BDSM-related stuff. I'm not as educated about BDSM, but I just brushed it off. I was more focused on her, and how much I enjoyed being with her.

This new info eventually got us talking about how much we both enjoy sex, and it led us to doing exactly that. My intention doing this had nothing to do with her confession. Like her, I didn’t want to move too fast, as we felt the connection was strong.

Since the date, things were going great. We were talking/texting daily, flirting, all that good stuff. However, this past Friday, she never responded back to me and went MIA for almost three days. This behavior seemed totally unlike her, but I went on with my weekend anyway.

I eventually decided to reach out and keep it low key, and said ""I hope you had a nice wknd. We should plan our next date. What do you think?"". She replied minutes later, saying that she ""had a crazy emotional rollercoaster of a weekend"", but that she's ""good now"" and ""would love to see me"". Yet, when I asked her what her schedule was for the upcoming week/wknd, she never replied back.

Two days later (yesterday), I was starting to wonder wtf was going on. I reached out and first asked if she was doing ok, and if she was able to check her schedule. She replied back, saying that her ""mood has been in recovery mode"", but that she ""wants to see me again"", and asked if I'm free this upcoming Friday. I locked it in. We exchanged a few texts, but then she went back to ignoring again.

I feel as though something is going on behind the scenes. Could she have a mental illness? Could there be another guy in the picture? Any comments on the situation? I would really appreciate it.

RELATIONSHIP —  CHEATING, an issue which is never new to us all. Just like I always say, disclaimer, I am no expert when it comes to relationships and what not. Also, points posted might most likely be just a HIT or MISS but what- e- vuuuhhhh! Moving on... 

So, my friend's trivia question was, "" If you broke up with your ex for let's say, a long time ( 3 years for example), then wants to be back with you BUT... there's that big BUT right there..  the reason of the breakup was HE CHEATED ON YOU WITH HIS EX GF AND GOT HER PREGNANT, would you welcome him back or let him go?!""  

Without any second thoughts, I answered, ""NO!"" (All caps for intensity level, lol) Do I have to explain?! Okay, fine.. I'll just emphasize 2 strong points.


First of all,  if a man GENUINELY loves you, never will the word cheating cross his mind cause he is so busy working on your relationship. He's interested in getting to know you each day and he's excited to discover the whole you (vice versa). And although we all have imperfections (in all aspects) and shortcomings, using it as an excuse while being in a relationship is not a valid reason for him to cheat on you. Yes, nobody's perfect and people commit mistakes, but cheating is not just a mistake, it's a choice. Men with STRONG PRINCIPLES in life would never do such thing. They always value the very most precious things they have in life and if your man loves you, then you should be one of those he treasures. If he does otherwise, well, you're the judge to that. 

Second, that the "" I believe that if you broke apart and come back together again, you're meant to be.."" saying, never applies to everything. You have to always consider those red flags that's on your list. WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND. If you caught him cheating on you once, what makes you think he won't do that again? IT IS ALREADY IN THEIR SYSTEM!  They chose to do it. Before you two met, he already was a cheater. Do you think he never cheated on his ex before you?? The reason why they broke up might be just the same reason why you two broke up. Save yourself!
GIRL,WAKE UP!!!!  Why on earth would you want to be back with someone who already broke your trust and hurt you so much?? Not only will this kind of men destroy your whole being, they will literally make your life miserable. And this is where self-pity, insecurities, and other negativity starts.
KNOW YOUR WORTH! You are a diamond! Not some cheap ass plated jewelry. If he prefers cheap items, then so be it. Remember, ""CHEAP ITEMS ATTRACTS MOST BUYERS"". You are rare, and unique. You deserve to be with a man who has the same strong values and standards as you. 

On a sidenote, please, if you're the type who can't literally just stick to one, might as well be straight forward about it to the other party. So you won't hurt anyone. And so they will be able to finally meet the ones that is for them. I don't know who else is with me on this but just sharing my point of view. That's all. And I, thank you!

He responded very kindly and gave me his Snapchat without me even asking and told me to snap him if I ever wanted to talk. So the next day comes and he snaps me first. The conversation flows pretty well with some but very little flirting. This continued on every day for about 2 weeks, in which he’d almost always snap me first. Eventually I gave him my number telling him he could text me if he wanted, so he did later that night. We talked for alittle and then he stopped responding after a double text and eventually a good night text, which he never responded to. I haven’t texted him since because I didn’t want to be pushy or annoying.

The back story on this guy is that he’s very  nice but super shy and afraid of relationships so I don’t know if that had to do with this? Not to sound conceited but I’m a decently attractive girl so I don’t know if he was intimidated by me if he hasn’t had much attention from girls? Maybe he’s too nervous to initiate the conversation again? I’m just confused because he seemed genuinely interested. 

I’ve thought about texting him and apologizing if I scared him off and explain that he seemed very sweet and I just wanted to get to know him... but I don’t want to seem desperate.

We usually get along well. There has never been any problem between us before regarding ideologies.

But yesterday when we were talking I said I won't cook non vegetarian because I'm pure vegetable and that's off limits for me. You can surely eat it but cook for yourself. I won't.

I'm India, here people are hell bound on gender roles and ik I wouldn't be able to change that. So ik I won't have choice in all these and I'm okay with it. I like cooking so it's not an issue.

But when we were having the above discussion he said ""If someone has to cook ny himself why would anyone get married"". I said if so, hire a cook, why get married at all. He replied ""One of the minor reason to get married is this.""

I'm okay with cleaning, cooking because we split work or responsibilities. I'm not okay with someone marrying me just because they wouldn't have to work.

This should be taken as responsibility and honor. It shouldn't be the reason. I felt like he showed that only reason he wants to get married is to avoid work. 

I felt it to be degrading. Even after gender roles we have here, I think this to be wrong.

All the mums became (and remain) good friends and  all the families stayed in touch as we grew up, so we have known each other for our whole lives. Her and I were friendly growing up but due to not seeing each other often (we only see the mothers group families once or twice a year) it was always really awkward with small talk and we never really got to properly know each other.

Fast forward to a month ago, we are 24 and haven't seen each other since who knows when, she likes me on Hinge (dating app) and I wasn't sure if it was a joke so I liked back and we got to talking on and off, the conversation was slightly flirty but also lots of general talk about work/studying. she mentioned that she'd be interested in going out for drinks sometime, and yesterday I asked her to do so out of nowhere, to which she told me she yes and that she is very excited.

Now, I don't know what the intent behind this going out is. If it was drinks was with a complete stranger off of a dating app, I'd have a better idea of what the other person was hoping to get out of it, but because its someone I vaguely know I don't know if this is just a friendly catch up as mates, or if there are more romantic/sexual intentions in play. 

For me, I personally would be interested in pursuing something more if the drinks goes well, but I am worried that I will misread the situation. If I knew whether it was a friendly event or a proper date, I think it would really help me figure out how to be on the night.

I also think its important to note that this is my first date (?) with a girl since my breakup with my ex of 3 years (ended a year ago), so I am very nervous to put myself back out there again.

I know I am overthinking this, but if anyone had any advice I would really appreciate it.

I think I figured why dating feels tricky for me. I'm at an age where most people have already experienced their firsts, so things are maybe a little less magical than they were at 16/17/whatever age you were and been in relationships, so maybe you're a little bitter or broken hearted because you've likely already been in love. But you've done it before. 

And I don't hate my journey because it's made me into me, but what I don't like navigating is it's like, everyone's done the rodeo already and I'm still getting used to the horse. (be kind to my euphemisms). I'm feeling extra because something meant something to me, when I'll probably just be a faded image in their rear view mirror. 

Like, I went on a few dates, found this guy really attractive, liked what I knew about him. And sure, I didn't know a huge amount. Pink flag for next time that they weren't maybe emotionally available. But it felt promising - a lot of a dates I go on, I don't see a romantic connection there. And I felt a bit giddy (honestly, save me) and it felt comfortable, like it could be something, while also trying to not attach because we'd only been on 3 dates. And then he ghosted. And I'd never made out so much with someone, let alone probably been a few dates away from sex for the first time. I should have told him I'd never had sex before, when he invited me back to his, but would have informed him on our next date had there been one.

But I know I come across as cool and fun and like I've dated a lot, but I still have firsts ahead of me. So it's like, these things feel extra because they're new to me. 

So I can know my worth and what I deserve, but getting ghosted when I was feeling fluttery and thinking about finally having sex (yay!) just feels like being jilted by your Year 7 camp boyfriend Richard who ditched you for Shelly-Anne because she has weed and into fingering, if the rumours are true. On paper it sounds basic as fuck, but it didn't feel basic as fuck to me because a small part of me is still in year 7, thinking Richard could have taken me to prom. (Exaggerated, but hope that paints the picture of that fluttery newness I'm trying to explain) 

I'm emotionally mature and wise for my age, but not when it comes to dating. Would have been easier to fumble awkwardly with a hs boyfriend, than be fumbling through firsts on apps.

And sure. Dating can feel extra at any age and everyone has their own hurdles to jump over, and that will probably differ for different ages, but it's especially something when you're still figuring out how all this works. Dating and love and sex, and feeling big feelings when you got your hopes up too soon.

Thanks for letting me vent.

I’m bi (21F). I had a girlfriend for three years when I was 16-19. 

It was a horribly toxic relationship and I don’t talk about it often because of the toxicity but also because I’ve started to go back into the closet these past two years. 

I still am attracted to girls, duh, but I’ve come to terms with the fact that I’m likely only going to be dating guys from here on out - because it’s quite tough to be queer in my country anyway. 

I’ve been dating guys and I quite like this one guy, but whenever we talk about our dating and sexual history, I’m not honest about my relationship with her.

I talk about her as if she was a guy and when we talk about my sexual history, I change the details of my stories (they’re true but they’re filtered). 

He is an amazing guy and he is understanding. It has nothing to do with him but it’s more of a fear I have WITHIN myself. 

I can truly see a future with him but I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to tell him what really happened.

It’s just really weird because she was so nice to me in prior years, before and after prom, and then suddenly switched.

We were sending some dirty memes while we are on call until I said something I shouldn't have said - ""Oh I didn't know you were so dirty"" in  a very sarcastic manner. I didn't know how it slipped out. She basically lost interest after that. I didn't know how it slipped out of my mouth. I apologised profusely again and again but she said we weren't compatible and couldn't talk to me anymore. I am still regretting that line I said to her.

Great chemistry, both got each other thoughtful creative presents for each other’s birthday. From the first date she told me off the bat that she’s never been in a “real” relationship and had only seen someone for up to 2 months. And during that situation she was also seeing other people(as was the other person and this was communicated to each other). I knew from the beginning she liked having multiple partners and she has always been 100% up front about what her perspectives on dating are.
I have a different perspective as once I really like someone I only want to be with this person. For these two months it’s been great, we’ve only been seeing each other. However the conversation I always knew was coming happened and she asked about my thoughts about dating other people. I told her I wouldn’t really mind(slight white lie) if she slept with someone but dating someone I wouldn’t be happy with. However, she wants to actually go on dates with people and see them. This hurt a little bit as even though I knew that we’d have this talk eventually, it felt like I wasn’t offering her everything she needed. She said that that wasn’t the case and that different people just have different things to offer. Also, I semi-hoped our situation was going to be different than her open situations in the pasts as she kept telling me how rare for her the relationship her and I have is.
Again, she has never been dishonest at all about what she is into and we get along so well. This isn’t a situation where she is lying and trying to hook up with someone behind my back. She just has a different view on dating. My question is has anyone who is normally monogamously inclined had experience transitioning to a situation like this?

We get two very conflicting ideas on what to do. But the common denominator is that it is still on the men approach in women to be approached

Not every girl is mature in how she rejects A man also. A guy could muster up a confidence and ask out a girl he likes but if she embarrasses him publicly then he'll probably not try to do that again.

I find myself kicking myself after years of trying to analyze why I couldn't find a girlfriend. There were so many girls who were throwing interest at me but because I was so scared of getting it wrong or being labeled a creep that I just never went for

I had an Uber driver about a month ago who seemed to be very flirty but because she was the driver and I was a man and we're both in an enclosed space like a car I did not go for it

But obviously judging by her social cues she was into me but it wasn't worth the risk to me at the time

I had a classmate who was super flirty also but I always chopped it up to her just acting girly until I started realizing that she always made it a point to make physical contact with me. Whether it be a pat on the shoulder or on the chest and of course I never went for it

People do LDRs (he’s currently in one with someone), but compared to actual in-person relationships it’s just not the same.

When we initially started texting, we were talking pretty regularly. It wasn't anything too crazy, just casual conversations, but the ball really started to get rolling when we met up in person. I never expected to enjoy someone's company as much as I did since it has been almost 3 years since I went on a date and things went really well. We ended up making out in the first date but didn't hook up till after the second date, and since then things moved a little too quickly.

Now the problem is when after the first 4 times? We met up, he started tapering off a bit. Texts where I used to get instant responses and are not getting any responses and I understand things can get busy but to me it didn't make any sense. When we are together in person, everything is fine and he would be very doting to me. We always have pretty good fun and would do things together but it just irritates me when I can't get a simple reply back with texting. During cases like these he would text me back the around midday the next day, and would apologize stating how busy he was but then the conversation just dies down there.  

Now because this hurts my pride a little bit, my instant reaction is to just ghost/block/avoid him because it hurts a little bit and I avoid situations like these. But after having some conversations with some friends last night, they suggested that I wait it out a bit since the guy promised to come see me next week, and we do end up seeing each other at least once per week, and to ask him what his intentions are. 

I guess my question is, I'm currently trying to be patient, calm down, and not overthink till i see the guy. I know I sound pretty panicky here but im a pretty mellow person on the outside, while panic central on the inside haha....

But yes, my question is:  
a) despite the fact that we've been talking and seeing each other a little over a month, is it too weird or alarming for me to ask a very lowkey casual question as to what his intentions are?

b) if i do ask, are there any suggestions as to how i could go at it? I know its not the ideal question to ask but because im trying to keep my emotional health in check, i figured it was worth asking since at the end of the day i should prioritize myself.

My parents own a store that sells those scratch-and-win kinda instantaneous lottery tickets. We sell them and give away the prizes but then we need to get the already scratched tickets to another store (inside a small shopping center) which sells them to us in bulk so they can give us back the total amount of prize money. Maybe this was confusing, but this isn't the crux of the problem anyway

There's this new cute girl working at that store around my age, maybe younger. I always tried to maintain a formal, professional relationship and never even considered making any kind of move, I always went in, exchanged the tickets back into money, thanked her, went back out. I don't want to risk putting another employee who is being paid to be nice to me in an uncomfortable position.

Today, though, was different. As I was finishing and saying goodbye she went ""Are you leaving already? You have only just arrived"". I just laughed and said something like ""Ahah I appreciate the sentiment but unfortunately I have more stuff to do"". Then as I was signing a paper I have to sign to say I went to pick up the money, she said ""Do you want me to sign your copy too?"", which I'm pretty sure she knows there's no reason whatsoever for her to sign it lol again I simply replied ""No, I don't think that's needed. I mean, sure if you want to go ahead, I'm not stopping you"". She just laughed her ass off at this and I have no idea why, just said something like ""I just love giving autographs"". Under any other circumstance without a employee-customer relationship going on I would have added something like ""And if you want to write your number next to it then I bet it would look even better"" or whatever came to mind but I felt that would be innapropriate. She then started asking me questions about my course and internship (she's on her own internship) even though there were other customers waiting their turn, I just said ""Boy, you really want me to stay don't you?"". She just laughed again and offered me a bench to sit down with her for a while, but at this point I just smiled, said my goodbyes and left (because my dad was waiting outside, otherwise you can bet I was taking the invite at this point)

At some point, though, I made a mistake. I think I dropped a $10 bill somewhere, 99% sure. I remember counting the money in front of her, realizing there was $10 extra, putting it away somewhere, but either because I am sleep deprived right now or out of confusion because there were extra tickets than what had been ordered and I had to withdraw more money, I have no clue where I put that bill. I either left it there or it fell down on my way to the car. I even recounted the money three times and asked her to attend to other customers because I was keeping getting lost.

Still after leaving and guaranteeing the $10 were missing I had to go back and warn her to tell her colleagues about the situation so they would notify us if they found them. This second visit was strange because part of my mind was like ""Ask her out. Ask for her number. Ask her if she wants to grab a coffee with you on her next break. Ask her if the invitation to sit down is still open"" and another part of my mind was ""Shut up. Don't be an asshole who makes her uncomfortable and rushes things. Go inside, tell her what happened, admit some responsability and remove pressure by saying maybe you messed up your math, move a few boxes around to look for the bill, ask her to notify her colleagues and leave. Keep the professionalism""'. The second part won but there were a few moments I awkwardly stopped or fidgeted as I figured what I should do.

After I left I went back to my car. The first part of my brain still won the next battle, it convinced to go back inside without going to her particular store, look to the ground for the money, grab a coffee, and then decide whether I want to go talk with her again or not. So I went in again, passed by her (she was going out on a smoking break), didn't talk to her and went for a coffee instead, and at this point my mind woke back up and screamed ""Alright you're just being annoying and somewhat creepy now, you have absolutely no business still being here and she knows that. If you talk to her again today you'll just ruin your chances and make her uncomfortable any time she sees you from now on. Just leave her alone and talk to her more personally next time you come if you wish to do so"".

And that's what I did. Finished my coffee and left. She was still smoking outside, called me over to ask if I had found anything, I said that I hadn't, reiterated that maybe I had just messed up the math, said I would appreciate it if she notified her colleagues, she told me not to worry and smiled, and I finally left.

Questions: a) Did I mess this up by seeming too pushy or did I save myself in time (at least professionally)? b) Should I ask her some personal questions next time or keep it 100% formal? c) Part of me is worried that I came across as a dummy or clumsy for losing the bill, how true is that?

I feel like lately I've been all over the place because I would like to be in a serious relationship, but then I also think about how shopping by myself or doing things by myself is nice because I can take my time. I'm guess the in-between of that would be getting to know someone romantically on dates but sometimes I feel like dating can be exhausting.

That i look like an uneducated person and im ugly and all that bad judgement that obviously hurt me mentally and emotionally, ileft their house immediately that night. Her grandma said all those things with out knowing me, i’m a well paid artist here in our city, a freelance photographer and i own two businesses, i can obviously provide for my whole family. i actually let it pass cause i love her, but little did i know that she felt guilty after that night and secretly hide her feelings about what her grandma was saying about me. Just now that guilt that ache she hidden from me explode, she said all this things about how she is not worth it for me, that shes just a burden in my life that she caused suffering. She broke up with me cause she doesn’t love me anymore she’s not happy,  the guilt eaten her feelings from me and i understand that.
