We have had several ups and downs throughout our relationship and we always found our way back to each other. We have alot of cultural and racial similarities and everything about us just feels so right. We even decided that we are going to marry each other and have told our parents about it. My parents came to terms with it however his parents seemed iffy about him marrying a girl that they DONT know and brushed the idea off. I am going off to uni in a few months, do you guys think it would be ideal to pursue this relationship when his parents weren't very supportive of the idea? I want to start uni with a fresh slate rather than be in a relationship with no potential future .

6,qih40f,1635526202,First Raincheck on Date #4. What's next?,"We‚Äôve been talking for a couple weeks now (and we had 3 dates so far). He \[M22\] was planning our next date but failed to come through last minute because of family stuff. While it‚Äôs normal to receive his texts in the middle of the night ever since we talked, I just felt like this one was odd, as if I could‚Äôve known something like this sooner would be better. 

I \[M23\] spiraled inside, and initially I felt angry. But I realized I wasn‚Äôt angry, I was hurt. I‚Äôve been through so many flakes on dates #1. And seeing this happen to someone that ive been seeing hurts more. I just have like PTSD on it. Luckily I was able to send a heartfelt message hoping that he‚Äôs doing good. 

For more context, we agreed to postpone the date at another time. This made me feel uneasy, and I was all, ‚ÄúHere we go. Another goddamn flake.‚Äù And lo and behold look where we are now. So I was already disappointed that not only did the date get postponed. But instead I got rain checked/cancelled. 

The message he sent. He seemed real genuinely sincere about it, and I would like to think nothing but the best of him. But there‚Äôs something that I‚Äôm doubting that I would like to know (if he‚Äôs no longer interested or not, etc). As someone going through his first relationship/dating phase, I want to know the signs. This was very unexpected from him, and I never saw this side of his vulnerability (assuming if true). 

It‚Äôs been a couple days since we last talked after that situation (wanted to also give myself time to breathe and have space), and I was planning on sending a ‚Äúchecking up on you‚Äù text. I was hoping maybe I can talk about where we‚Äôre going in this relationship soon also and if we‚Äôll continue seeing each other exclusively. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about him since.

Here‚Äôs the message I plan to send later:

Hi \_\_\_\_\_! Happy Halloweekend! Just wanted to check up on you if you're okay and let you know that I'm here for you if you need anything. And if there‚Äôs anything I should know, I‚Äôm all ears üòÅüíï

I‚Äôm thinking way over this but it seemed like a serious message. It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs weird that if he asked for a rain check, then he would have offered another date right?

Is there anything that I should do next or be prepared for? What advice do you have for someone going through this if ever?

9,qihi1m,1635527284,Most people can fall in love with most other people,"First let's lay out the exceptions

1. If your sexual orientations don't line up
2. if you hold a certain idea or political/moral principle as paramount and another happens to disagree with that.
3. The other person is SO ugly(to you), you can't look at his face without feeling the need to vomit. 
4. You or the other person has serious mental issues

Now if we remove these four cases, I think most people can fall in love with each other IF they talk honestly with each other and try to explore each other's personalities without or with minimal judgment.  
I think if we remove our judgement, and make another feel safe to open up about themselves we can truly explore the personality and all the nuances of another human being, and if two people do that with each other that will make them very close to each other and they will cherish each other's presence. The entirety of another human being's personality is such interesting that I think 2 to 3 hours of honest conversation can form a bond of love and care between two people. But this takes many years because people only show little parts of their personalities to others gradually unfolding it.  
But I think this can be done in a 3 hour time if two people open up about their life, things that give them pleasure, their life experiences, insecurities, traumas, philosophies etc and both of them try to see the beauty and poetry in the life of the other person. 

  
Though of course this is an ideal, romanticised theory in my head, so I have removed a lot of real world problems from it.

This time she got annoyed because I asked her if she was dating some guy she was hanging out with, I get it, I overstepped my bounds, now I need some help, how do I turn this around?  


How do I turn it around from ""This guy is so lame and boring"" into, well, yeah, fun and interesting to talk to. I know I have to back off now for a while. Like, I constantly forgett things I have asked about in the past. Get nervous bring up the same shit, and constantly forgett about it, I get it, no wonder she gets annoyed with me. I'm just wondering, is it possible to turn this around? How much space should I give her to forgett about my current stupidity?  


We talk mainly over snapchat atm. I'm not the same as the guy she met, I guess I'm too straightforward and don't keep it casual. I'm really trying to connect but I just don't know how, like, am I just not getting it? Is she totally uninterested anymore and just wants me gone and replies to me out of being polite? I have such a hard time seperating the two. I know she got mad because I asked her if she was dating that guy. I gotta write that down as a number one question never to ask again. Like, I am so timid and stupid, I need to project more confidence and be more playful, gosh, I think I've broken my chances forever, time to go look for new prospects?

A really great girl (24) has been in my class for a few weeks now. (I 24)  I did a lot with her in the last few weeks. 6 weeks ago she told me that she have a boyfriend.    
But I fell already in love with her‚Ä¶    
Now I need your help to interpret something.  We talked about her moving in the near future. I asked her if she is moving in with her boyfriend.  20 seconds of silence, followed by stuttering, she told me that her bf has a new job and that things are not going well between him and her.  Later that day she showed me photos from the mountain village where she grew up. She told me how fun it was to hay in summer as a kid. She invited me to hay with her family in the summer and said she would like it very much and enjoy it if I came too.    
That something was in the air not only struck me but also many others in the class. That's why I'm even more insecure.  Meanwhile, she keeps touching me or holding my arm.  She also told me that I was very special, she never had a connection to a person as quickly as to me. (She also told me its hard for her to be with much or new people)  


We work on a school project together and she had a Question on Saturday and really wanted to call me. So we had a 5 min talk about her Question, but then she was talking for 1.5 Hours about private stuff.  
I like to talk to her but I think that's the task of her bf.

Another example is that we really like eating together. She told me she usually doesn't like to eat with other people including her BF, but with me, she has a lot of fun and really enjoys it.

20,qiigq4,1635530067,This needs to stop.,"Whenever someone of a certain age talks about their lack of experience, there's always some idiot in the comments mentioning ""marriage"" and/or ""kids"". Like they'd say stupid crap like ""My friend didn't have a girlfriend until he was 27. They are now married with kids."". As a 28 year old with no experience who does NOT want to get married and have kids, this pisses me off.First off these comments are stupid because they person responding assumes that the OP actually wants to get married and have kids. Newsflash: NOT EVERYONE WANTS THAT! I for one am still undecided on marriage. I might consider it if I meet someone who's a good match. At the very least I'll consider an LTR. However I REFUSE to ""date for marriage"". Kids are a huge no-no for me. Honestly nothing sounds more lame and stressful than being a parent. I have zero desire to be a dad. I'm too cool for that anyway.

Secondly, people who are inexperienced are 99% of the time ARE NOT LOOKING FOR MARRIAGE. I mean think about this logically. Why would someone who has zero dating experience, be thing about marriage and/or kids? Most people with zero experience want to actually experience dating for the sake of dating. I for one just want to get experience. I want to experience the fun side of dating that I miss out on. If during that time I meet the right person I might at least consider an LTR. However I REFUSE TO SETTLE DOWN AND I REFUSE TO DATE FOR MARRIAGE.

Thirdly most people assume because of the person's age, that they will be looking for marriage and kids. This pisses me off because all it does is reinforce these arbitrary age expectations/milestones which pressure people to do something because it's ""expected of them"". I for one refuse to conform to those expectations. The ONLY expectation I will conform to (because I have to) is making a living and paying the bills. Everything else is bullshit.

So, in conclusion, unless the person specifically mentions that they want to get married and/or have kids, do NOT mention them to anyone who has no experience in dating. Because it comes off as if you're telling them that it's too late to experience the more laid back, ""in the moment"", type of dating.

27,qij7ww,1635532225,"If the problem was me, tell me it was","This might come across as a completely incoherent rant, but I need to get this out.

A couple months ago I (20M) briefly dated a girl (20F) who I felt completely crazy about (mid July to early September). We went to the same university and had been casual friends fore a while, but I had always felt some attraction for her and we hit it off at a party and it was going really well. We did tons of fun stuff together and I was incredibly happy after such a really shitty time with the pandemic and all. We were together for about a month, and then all of the sudden out of the blue she makes a comment, ""I don't know if I'm in the right headspace to be in a relationship right now"". We talked and it turns out she had gotten roofied in a few months before we got together (just the drug‚Äîshe wasn't raped) and broke up with her previous partner shortly after that for related reasons, and she was still feeling a lot of trauma from that and wasn't ready to be in a relationship. She emphasized that it wasn't me and she just needed to take a lot of time to herself to get over this stuff. I felt pretty wronged by this happening, and really very sad that this didn't work out, because it really did feel special for me.

Fast forward to about a month ago, where I started noticing her spending a lot of time around another guy. We go to a pretty small university, so it's difficult to avoid seeing people around. The way he acted around her and his body language made it incredibly obvious that he was interested, and it felt really shitty to see her seemingly humoring him by spending time together, especially after she had basically said she didn't want to date anyone. I reached out to a one of her friends who I was decent friends with too, and she (the friend) basically said that they were aware of this guy's interest and that my ex wasn't interested in him at all. I think the way I asked didn't come across well, and I think my ex heard about this and she felt like I was trying to set up her friends as informants and was mad at me for this (which is fair, I don't think I handled it well at all). The fact that she was mad about this was communicated to me through this mutual friend.

I've felt incredibly depressed about losing such an incredible person as a partner, and it made me feel even worse to know that I had made her an enemy with a stupid decision to bug her friend about this other guy, when I should have trusted her when she said she wasn't in a place to date anyone. I think, deep down, I still felt like there was a chance that it could have worked out at some point and that my antics had destroyed that chance. I started feeling very guilty about the way I'd acted and I wanted to find a chance to apologize to her sincerely for it. A couple of days ago, I saw her sitting on her own and I went up to her and did this. I said sorry for the way I'd acted, and that was that. I still felt kind of bad, but I felt good at least to get that apology off of my chest.

Or at least I did for a couple days, until last night. It was her birthday, and she had a decent-sized gathering that she sent out an open invitation for. I went with a friend and checked with her friend that I would be welcome, since I didn't want to ruin her celebration by making her feel uncomfortable or whatever. And there we were, all drinking a good amount and getting pretty drunk. And there that guy was, standing next to her the whole time. And they started getting a little touchy together and then were sitting on the sofa leaning against each other getting nice and cozy. I had to leave then, I was either about to kill someone or start crying. As far as I know, they ended up sleeping together. 

I'm sitting here writing this, feeling incredibly used and emotionally manipulated. I fell hard for her and it broke me when she broke up with me. Then she guilt-tripped me into feeling sorry for asking her friend about a guy that she wasn't interested in, but now she's probably cuddling in bed with that guy. I don't know what to do. I felt stuck on this girl, and it really felt special to me. She told me that the circumstances for a relationship just weren't right for us, that she needed a lot of time to herself. And then proceeded to get nice and cozy with a different guy. You said it wasn't me, but it sure as hell feels like it.

29,qijsug,1635533908,Why the unfollow?,"There is a girl I am interested in and I started to follow her on instagram years ago. I‚Äòve known her best friend for years, but I did not know her personally and I kind of wanted to get to know her IRL, so I‚Äôve never texted her. In these two years she looked at every story of mine and liked some pics. 

Finally, two weeks ago we had a class together, where we talked casually and where I noticed a few times she stared at me. She looks amazing and her personality seems to be even better. We had a drink together with other classmates and even formed a group to meet again. We will also have two more of these classes in one month. I noticed later that she had a BF for several years already, which was a big surprise because she never posted anything. I was kind of disappointed and decided not to do anything like asking her out unless they break up. 

So far so good. A few days after all of that, she unfollowed me. And I‚Äòm kinda puzzled why she would do that. I mean why unfollow now after years and after we‚Äôve finally met and also will meet in the future. I didn‚Äôt even really flirt with her or do anything stupid that night, we shared some laughs together and so forth. I also do not post too much, like 2 stories a month. 

What do you think why she did that? And do you think it‚Äôs a good idea to confront her? I mean she has a BF anyway so I do not have too much hope that something could come out of this. Yet at the same time I kind of feel it comes of as weird and desperate to confront her because we do not know each other that well.

31,qijvnt,1635534115,Lesbian Bed Death???,"My partner (19F) and I (19F) have had a pretty rocky relationship from the very beginning. I believe if I had the same problems with someone else I simply wouldn't be with them. But with her everything is so intense. Our love is very strong. When a problem arises we try our best to fix it. But I'm starting to wonder if that's enough. I feel like we are both draining each other because I feel as if we are not compatible.  I've done some research on compatibility in partnerships, and everything is assuring me that we will workout eventually. But I just can't shake this feeling of things maybe not working out. 

Last night I brought up something that has been bothering me for a long time, sex. We simply do not have sex. We haven't had sex in a couple of months, to be exact. When I have brought this up in the past she has told me, she's just uncomfortable with the places we have sex in(her car mostly) and that she does want to have sex with me. So I was expecting her to try to find a place for us to have sex, like a hotel room, or a Airbnb. She had made these suggestions but I see no action behind them. I feel very awkward bringing up sex with her, because I feel as if I'm pressuring her. I don't just want to have sex, I want her to want to have sex with me. I've thought about paying for a place in full instead of going half, and just overall showing more initiative to have sex on her terms. But I feel like that's too pushy and maybe not my place. I just want her to be comfortable, but I feel like anything I do will make her uncomfortable. I'm tired of making her feel like a bad girlfriend because she's not having sex with me. Because she's not a bad girlfriend. But I also don't want her to risk her comfort to accommodate my horniness.

I just wanted to ask some questions, because I'm not sure how to go about dating, because I basically don't feel crushes and sexual attraction. I used to when i was younger, but now I just don't feel anything. Can it be a result of bad experiences or is that just normal after growing up? It seems that even people older than me experience attraction at first glance, so I don't know why I don't anymore, and how to get past it.

I think maybe those feelings could develop after some time of knowing someone (who's right), but I'm really not sure. I could just go on a bunch of dates, but I don't wanna lead anyone on by going on dates when I'm not romantically or sexually interested in them, and not sure if I ever will be. I don't if know that's normal in dating, or that you're supposed to already be interested in them before going on a date?

(I think she likes me back, just is really nervous)","We're both 16, she's in two of my classes, but we sit on opposite sides of the room in both classes, we do face each other though. So, I can see her staring, and she does a lot. Like, many times each class a lot. I try to keep her in my peripheral vision, she will glance over any time we don't have an assignment, she'll look over after laughing with friends, or when I pass her in the halls. We make eye contact a few times each class when she stares, sometimes she looks away quickly but other times she holds her gaze. This has been going on for 3-4 weeks that I've noticed, maybe before then but idk.

The issue is that's she's really shy. We used to sit close in one of the classes, and so I would talk to her then, we do have a lot in common and we can hold a conversation really easily, but I don't sit remotely close anymore, we got new seats. She gave me her number last week when I asked and we sat close (like I said it was after a few weeks of talking in class) I've texted her, trying to talk more, but she's really slow to respond. She is really engaged when I do talk to her, but she just doesn't come over and talk to me herself.

I know she doesnt dislike me, I always let her stare first before I make eye contact, so I don't think she's staring because I sorta am.

Can I do anything other than try to talk to her in the hallway? Usually it happens really quick so I don't wave or say hi, and also it just makes short conversation, so I'm not overly inclined. I sent her the last text, so I don't want to double text either. I also don't want to ask her out yet as she's shy and I don't want to freak her out by moving too fast, so I think calling her just for small talk would just be kinda weird.

**4.

It might take years to undue all the negativity, but a bad bitch is nothing if not patient.

65,qimsle,1635542746,"A girl stares at me a lot, but never approaches me","We're both 16, and I have two classes with her. I start to pay attention to her as I have a bit of a crush, and I realize that she looks at me, very frequently. I might be working in the hall, she'd walk by, and she'd glance over her shoulder to look at me. She might get something out of her backpack in the ground, and while leaning over she'll look, and she'll glance over while a teacher is talking or sometimes outright stare for seconds. I haven't been keeping track, but this as been going on for at least 3-4 weeks. We make eye contact on occasion, it's been more frequent the past week as I've been looking directly at her more to try to get her attention, rather than keep her in my peripheral vision like I had been.

So, two weeks ago I decide to talk to her in my physics class since I have friends that sit at her table, and seating isn't strict as our teacher wants us to work on assignments together. When I am over there, we talk quite a bit, and can hold a conversation easily as we have a lot of classes and both play soccer. If I wait outside before class and end up next to her, she will start talking to me, but in neither class does she ever approach me.

She's normally a very shy person, she talks very quietly when talking to people she doesn't know, but is pretty talkative to me, and not quiet. Her being such a shy person is what surprises me about the staring, it's so much that if she's giving an analysis on something we read in English, she won't look at the teacher or the class but she will look towards me out of the corner of her eye. At her table in physics, there is another girl that I hardly talk to, but one time I was listening to the other girl, and she was too, but she kept glancing at me to see how much I was paying attention to the other girl.

The issue is, now in physics we moved seats, so I don't have an excuse to go and talk to her. I asked for her number last Thursday after a class where we spent a bit extra time talking, and I texted her but she was pretty slow to respond.

Does anyone have a guess why she might stare so much but never initiate much?

- love bomb hard in the beginning 
- their dates are typically very spontaneous and never thought out more than a few days in advance
- future fake all the things they want to do with you
- send a very exuberant text almost immediately after the date or the next morning 
- are actually engaged texters but for some reason are not very interesting but the in person dates make up for it
- send the most mixed signals with you sometimes believing they want a relationship and other times believing they want a FWB and never quite knowing where to go with it
- dominate the decision about when the dates occur. They will invite you but the minute you want to plan a date they lose interest

70,qin6fs,1635543925,How did you get over someone toxic and manipulative? (20s),"Hi everyone,

I dated someone who was my dream person. We were even born on the same day, same year, looked the same, both wear braces, and had the same foreign names. We had similar interests, and I would secretly hope to find someone like him, he turned out way better than I could ever imagine. We got along really well, and found ourselves comfortable with spending the whole day together. But it didn't turn out well. We had bad communication and I was incredibly insecure, and I found him manipulative. I think I might have OCD. 

He was quite controlling,  sexually aggressive (which he agreed to) and distrusting.

Whenever, I brought up my boundary about not wanting to date someone who was seeing several people at once, he would decline it. He then would bring up how he was spending the weekend with a ""mate"" in the park (because we would get sexual in the park) and then with his friends then leer at me, when I tried to tell him my boundaries. He blamed me for him not wanting a relationship YET, because I didn't trust him. He then asked, ""How long would it take for to trust me?!"" Which is true to an extent, because I asked a mutual friend if he was actually dating someone else, because he pressured me to pay for him a few times and never ordered for himself. He would then get my details mixed up, like how I was working full-time, but then he would say maybe he'd go to the exhibition would me during the work day.

He was a Senior Software Engineer at 24, so he definitely could afford to order and pay for his own food, on top of him choosing to Uber to our dates, which totalled $40 every time. He also worked at a bank, and asked me invasive questions, like asking to see my license, or which bank I banked after making out and trying to finger me.

He even flaked on a picnic Zoo date we planned together after continuously telling me how excited he was and changed our plans to a going to a lookout at 5pm, ""because it was closer to my place"". I got the gut feeling that there was someone else. He then said he couldn't text me back during the night, since you don't text others during dinner, and then used me as an example as I didn't text during our dates. He then proceeded to text during our dates unlike before. Although, he offered to show my his bank transactions and texts, I felt that was too much.

Most times, he pressured me to pay first and didn't order for himself. I get this could be a sign of nervousness and him being inexperienced... but then towards the end he'd be pushy, which he apologised for, but then he'd say things, ""Yeah but have you seen the way that you look?"" or ""It's okay if we end this. You know you have to say No, because I can't tell if you're consenting with your eyes closed."" After he said that, he followed me around a train station, after I asked him for privacy to use my debit card, he admitted to looking over my shoulder, however, he only did that when I was entering my PIN. He didn't back off, followed me and forced himself on me, when I wanted to bring up the issue with his multidating, he then asked if he could take pictures of me while kissing me. I just blanked out, because this happened a lot.

He would then start kissing me, whenever I brought up about the other person. After the last date, I tried to make plans and then he would say maybe all the time, so I asked for a break. He then extended the break, and said he didn't want me there about an event he previously invited me to, but fine, he was going to be there. He would go on and on about he wanted me to be his girlfriend,  and that all of this was just because he was awkward, an idiot, stupid.  But when I met him for the last time, he scoffed at the idea that I wanted him to be my boyfriend, he then apologised about being non-comittal, and said he didn't want a relationship, because I didn't trust him. He then proceeded to text in front of me with a huge smirk on his face, when I was about to cry.

The ones who seek attention from every guy and who will use me (yes I luckily see this and can filter them out kind of). I got this one girl at my gym who seemed to be ""interested"" in me and we dated a few times. But then I got told she went with every guy from our gym. And just gets ""passed around"". Whenever I was doing a workout with her, she would flirt with other guys, thinking I didnt notice. I'm not sure but I'm positive she tried to make me jealous as well, whenever I was around she would be ignoring me at times and be overly excited with other guys. I feel like this girl was ""interested"" because I was one of the guys who didnt validate her?

First, he‚Äôs a ‚Äúprofessional athlete‚Äù and relies on sponsorships for income and funding for his events. Second, he is currently living on his family‚Äôs property, rent-free; he moved in with me temporarily, but we decided it wasn‚Äôt the right time for that so he‚Äôs back on his family‚Äôs property. Third, we have done some pretty fun (and, in retrospect, expensive) things together for dates, weekend fun, yada-yada-yada, which he insists on paying for every time. To my knowledge, he doesn‚Äôt have anything put away in savings because he‚Äôs had to spend it all on ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù expenses for his ‚Äúcareer‚Äù (which has yet to make money), and still has student loan debt to the tune of &gt;20k. Recently, he hinted at needing a loan because he is all out of money, and that was really the crux of my feelings toward the situation between us.

If someone says they want a secure future and to be able to provide for a family, wouldn‚Äôt it be logical for that person to find a steady source of income and begin to put away money long-term?

The last time (last week) we were together, I asked her directly what her intentions were. Let's be clear, we weren't talking about relationship, it was just to understand if she and I are going in the same direction. Here, let's say that now I don't know what to do with the answer sha gave to me.

I see stuff about how there's nothing wrong with ""saving yourself for the one"" and posts from people who've never dated but it's just because they're picky; how not having dated anyone simply means you're ""more mature"" and willing to wait. 

Well, here's the issue -- I can't relate to any of that. I'm literally so lonely and desperate, and I've tried apps and everything. I just feel horrible about it. It seems that everyone else my age who is a virgin/has never dated anyone is doing so out of personal choice. There's nothing wrong with that, it's a valid choice, but it just makes me wonder.... What's wrong with me, then? I do want someone, I do try, yet I can never seem to get anyone. Girls on apps just end up ghosting me after a few days, I get flaked on, blocked, etc. One time a girl (that I met in person, not on an app) lead me on for a whole fucking year just to tell me that I'm too much (because I wanted to talk to her more than once a month...) and block me...


 Oh, and forget about finding people in person because my luck seems to be even worse there. Nobody I'm interested in ever seems to be interested in the slightest, and believe me, I'm interested in a lot of women. I'm not even bad at flirting, my friends don't seem to think I'm doing shit wrong (and they're definitely honest with me when I fuck shit up, I know for a fact), they seem to attribute my misfortune to, well... Just pure bad luck. 

I have horribly low self esteem, but I don't show it. I try my hardest to fake it until I make it, but nothing seems to work and it just makes me hate myself more. I don't get it. Honestly, with each passing day I'm just losing hope that I will ever get a relationship,  or even just a hook-up. Yeah, it's that bad, I can't even find a hook-up...  I just want anything at this point, I'm so lonely and sexually frustrated...

So, that begs the question... What's wrong with me? Am I just ugly? That's what I'm starting to think. I don't know how hideous you have to be to fail this miserably, but probably pretty fucking hideous. 

I'm on the verge of just giving up completely, honestly. I don't know if there's any hope for me if I can't get one single person to be interested in me in the slightest. ""You're still so young yadda yadda yadda,"" yeah I guess but I'm still old enough that it's abnormal to not have any experience in this regard at all. I feel like it's only going to get worse the older I get. Seriously, what girl wants to date a 21 year old virgin? A 25 year old virgin? A 30 year old virgin? Must be pretty fucking pathetic, right? People are looking for serious, mature relationships by 25, and I'm basically an inexperienced child in comparison. Nobody's going to want to bother with me.

I guess this is more like a vent post. Sorry if this isn't the place for that. I'm just miserable and don't feel like I have anyone to go to. I try to be positive and confident, I really really do. But it feels like every time I build myself up, I just get knocked back down. It's hard to be confident when you genuinely don't feel like there's anything TO be confident about.

90,qiorng,1635549060,First date (calling it an unofficial one for now),"Context: Went to a college ministry event, ended up talking to two girls, got both their IGs but was only after the Asian girl, other was Indian. DMd her went well, asked her to coffee she said yes eagerly. I‚Äôm 21M white 5‚Äô4 in case anyone was wondering.
*didn‚Äôt use the word date because I was testing the waters*

We agreed to meet at the student center at 1:30pm. I left my dorm a bit early and got there at 1:10, played some pool while I waited. We went to Starbucks and I paid for her coffee (she wasn‚Äôt expecting it) then we went to the balcony and sat down and just talked. Talked for about 2 hours. She was shy at first but once we both got used to each other it went well. I noticed she started playing with her hair part of the way through. She took a strand of hair and was like straightening it while looking/talking to me. Then (and I missed this somehow) she told me she met most of her friends at the college ministry place and I quote ‚Äúand maybe someone special‚Äù while looking at me and playing with her hair, I.. kinda got it but didn‚Äôt know how to react tbh. Other than that we had some stuff in common and whenever she shared a story I related a story of my own to it, also made sure to ask some good questions and never interrupted. I did more of the talking at the second half than the first half. When it ended she said she had to hurry back to her dorm since we actually talked 20 min over the amount of time she had to meet up. I asked her to lunch next week and she said she would check how her biology and chemistry classes work was and let me know. I told her I‚Äôm free MWF after a 1:00. A bit after I got to my dorm I talked to some friends and they told me to dm her that I had fun and was looking forward to seeing her next/this upcoming week. (They said to not make it a question but to be assertive, she agreed in person but not set to a specific time or day at the moment). Haven‚Äôt heard back but I‚Äôm not worried.

My questions revolves around gemini being known as ""2 faced"" (really just bad descriptions and marketing/imagery imo.) I was curious if this has ever scared you from connecting with a gemini.

I actually went so far as to take it off my dating profile and let it slip into the conversation when/if it comes up",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qioz5d/does_gemini_scare_you/
94,qip1zc,1635550086,Girl cancelled even though bc she didn‚Äôt want to go out on Halloween?,"So I‚Äôve known this girl for like 4ish years, have always been acquaintances, we went out last week, we had set something for this week and she cancelled bc she basically didn‚Äôt really want to do anything bc it was Halloween. We were just going to go out to a bar and drink, but it seemed like she wanted to do something Halloween themed, so I offered the idea up of carving pumpkins or going to a haunted mansion.

She replied saying that maybe next week would be better, and I just said that sounded good, but like damn. At least lie to me to tell me you have an excuse, I‚Äôm not sure if she even thought it was a date, but that hurt. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to hit her back up bc that seemed a little rude and she‚Äôs really empathetic and warm, so I‚Äôm surprised she was like that.

I‚Äôm just gonna wait for her to hit me up, but like damn I don‚Äôt even see a point in going out with her anymore . I‚Äôm tryna think if I liked someone then I‚Äôd want to hangout with them either way, but I also could care less about Halloween, we‚Äôre in college and it was on a Sunday. She doesn‚Äôt even have plans as far as I‚Äôm concerned, and last time I paid like 70 dinner and I think she‚Äôs cool, but maybe I‚Äôm romanticizing her in my head bc she was my hisghcool crush.

She shaved her head and while she‚Äôs still pretty, I‚Äôm just not as into her as I used to be. I honestly feel sad, we hung out for 6 hours, she gave me compliments, we were touchy, and she was taking pictures of her food and almost cried bc the view was so nice. 

She was really thankful, but like damn this one stung a bit.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qip1zc/girl_cancelled_even_though_bc_she_didnt_want_to/
95,qip6qc,1635550549,About this Community,"Y'all have helped me realize several points of interest that I didn't know before with dating by using reddit. I really do enjoy talking to y'all, but somethings been annoying me. I get several messages from randoms asking to get to know me. I have no problems with that, I want to talk to more people. But I've had people who seem genuine, then immediately ask personal questions like where I live, how old am I, profession, and to go to another app to continue the conversation.

96,qipaop,1635550938,Caught feelings for FWB,"About a year and a half ago, I had matched with this insanely attractive man who also has the same interests as me. Our relationship had turned into a FWB right away and has been pretty frequent every since. 
I did catch feelings at first, but got over them quickly when I realized I didn‚Äôt really want a relationship. 
More recently, as in the last 2 times I have gone over, I have stayed the night and have slowly started to catch feelings for him again. 
To add, I had made a new tinder account a few months ago, as I‚Äôm now in the space to be in a relationship. And had seen his profile. We matched again, and in his bio it said he‚Äôd be moving to Cali around the beginning of the year. 
Now that the end of the year is coming, I am thinking of confessing the feelings I have for him. If it doesn‚Äôt work out and he doesn‚Äôt want to even be FWB anymore, he‚Äôll be moving anyway. But would it be a waste to tell him right before he leaves?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qipaop/caught_feelings_for_fwb/

It seems to be a trend where the women im dating either want to ghost after a date or stop really contributing to conversations in any meaningful way, i'm always the driver of conversations anyway and have to message first or i never hear from them. I dont want my time wasted but I have a hard time with not getting any closure from them on not being interested anymore.
