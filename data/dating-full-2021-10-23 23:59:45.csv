Hi everyone! This summer I (19f) met a guy (20m) at work, and we became close. I started crushing, and two weeks before I left for school I told him about my feelings. He was very professional about everything and we agreed to talk about it more when I left. After leaving the job he asked me out and we went on about 6 dates. Everything was going great, and I really fell for him and vice versa. However, once school got super busy I started to be really hot and cold with him. I was really stressed with school and my mental health definitely started to suffer. That resulted in me being constantly busy and not communicating with him as much. I realized that it isn’t fair to him to keep this relationship going so I had to break it off. But I made sure to clearly let him know that it was all on me, and that it was nothing about him. I let him know everything that I was going through mentally, and luckily he completely understood. He took it as well as I could have hoped and we ended things on good terms.

Here’s the thing, in December I’m gonna go back to work with him just for a couple weeks. I need a job when I’m on break from school, and that job pays so well I have to go back. When I broke things off with him I let him know that I’m looking forward to working with him again, but I would understand if he didn’t want to be around me at that time. He said that he wouldn’t avoid me if we do work together.

While I know we can be professional at work, do you think working with him will bring back those serious feelings? I still have feelings for him, but I realize that I’m not in a headspace to date right now. I assume that my feelings won’t be too strong by then, but could being around him more often again cause problems?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1092655,public,self,Will working with my (19f) “ex” (20m) bring back old feelings?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qeh2zm/will_working_with_my_19f_ex_20m_bring_back_old/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

We didn’t kiss but I hugged her saying that I like her.

I asked her out for next week but she replied today that she was really busy but that maybe next week she would be available.

I've been seeing this man for 2 years. 
It started very well. 
Lots of affection, he adored me. Made me feel special, wanted, heard, loved. 
That stopped. 
Now it's on and off problems. 

I'm at the point where everyone in my family and friends group hates him. 

I'm always walking on eggshells about whether or not I should share my feelings with him. I know that if I'm having a bad day I'll feel like I'm boring him. Or that he needs me to be happy or he'll be annoyed. 
If he frustrates me and I share that he frustrated me with him, he will pretty much ghost me for a little while because he's pissed or thinks I'm being sensitive over dramatic.

We agreed to be in a monogamous relationship but he won't let me call him my bf. He isn't sleeping with anyone - I know this for a fact - but he doesn't want people to think he's in a relationship. He makes comments to remind me we aren't together if he feels like my expectations of him are getting too high. 
For example we made plans for this Saturday. On Thurs night he goes off about how he is so glad he isn't in a relationship like his buddy because he doesn't owe anyone his time. 
Then I got frustrated and told him ""I feel like you're saying this so you can cancel Saturday on me"" - he said it had nothing to do with Saturday. 
Cut to Saturday and I haven't heard from him. I text him ""guess you aren't coming over"" - nope. ""Too tired"" 
So I ripped into him a bit and said ""I'm really disapointed"" now he isn't going to reply or speak to me for a while. 

My sister said she thinks this relationship is borderline emotionally abusive. I don't know. 
Sometimes we have lots of fun and he makes me feel good. But sometimes...I don't know. I feel like I'm alone. 

I've almost dumped him once before. He ended up crying and saying he can't live without me so I took him back. Still can't call him bf though. 

I don't know...

This shows in divorce rates where women initiate divorces far more than men do.

So last night I, **M(21),** went with my buddies to a local bar and I ended up having a really great time with this woman, **F(25).**

Pretty much I had a sense that this girl was attracted to me from the very beginning.

**By the way, F(25) is** ***my*** ***buddy's girlfriend's co-worker and they have known each other for well over 1+ years so I think I will end up seeing her again one way or another.***

**She also has a career while I am still a senior in college. Luckily we are both Finance people so it is nice to have that in common as well as a lot of similar interests. And our humor really clicks with each other too. Overall I feel the connection with her and she seemed to feel it too.**

# Anyways... here are the details

**10 P.M.**

When I first got to the place, we all met up and I was ordering my drink at the bar and I couldn't help but notice this girl constantly looking at me and ""accidentally"" bumping into me. I figured she was just a little tipsy, which was partly true, but I also figured something was up with her.

So I got my drink and we ended up talking for a little while and I was flirting with her and she was flirting back with me just as much.

She was pretty touchy as well. Even let me start sipping from her drink that she ordered. As well as coming back up to me to keep the conversation going even after we got separated earlier in the night.

**12 A.M.**

Then I let her know I had to move my car because my parking limit was about to expire. We ended up leaving together and once I got into the car, we started making out and getting pretty touchy.

**So I think everything is going well for me.**

So then after we realize we still need to move the car, she walks back with me to the bar and we let our friends know we'll meet up with them at another bar.

**2 A.M.**

We were pretty much 100% sober by now even though before we were only a little buzzed so it wasn't just a drunk encounter.

So yea we never met up with our friends either LOL. We ended up driving out to Wendy's and grabbing a quick bite. And kept getting more and more flirtatious and intimate in the car. I moved it into the backseat to make ourselves more comfortable and I think she reciprocated the idea because then she was all over me - kissing my neck, biting, grabbing my dick, sucking on her tits, etc. Everything but sex.

So then she tells me...

""*I feel really embarrassed saying this...""*

""*I really want to fuck you.""*

**This made me so happy hahaha. All I could say back was ""can you guess what I want to do?""**

&amp;#x200B;

So then I eventually asked her if she could give me something.

And I couldn't put into words, but **I asked if she wanted to blow me.**

So she tells me that she wants to, but she's worried it will lead to sex and she is always unsure about sex on a first meet.

I didn't take this personally because I am not the most extroverted, wild guy that I was acting like tonight... so I ended up finishing up and driving us back to our friend's place.

His girlfriend drove F(25) back home and we all waved goodnight and I drove back home too.

**Luckily, I did grab her** ***digits. I sent her a text today saying 'hey I had a lot of fun last time. we should hang again sometime'.***

&amp;#x200B;

**Today, she responded, ""hey aww i'm glad. let's hang out again sometime :)'**

&amp;#x200B;

**So,** r/dating_advice, **should I pursue her with all the signs flashing in front of me?**

I work about 55 hours a week and I can't reduce the number of hours. I never get to do anything for me. I don't meet friends, I almost never meet new people. I pretty much don't leave the house except to go work. From my perspective, it's dating apps or bust. But I don't know how I'm going to meet anyone when I just get so depressed just going on it; it make me want to turn it off immediately. I also feel resentful because it eats away at the very little free time I have, and I could actually be doing something fun instead. But obviously a fun distraction isn't going to make my life any better in the long run. My male friends say that while no top model I look good and I should be no problems finding someone, but my profile is not ideal or conveying it that well. In my mind, I wanted to go out and take new photos, but I don't know that I even really can afford to take a day for that. It's not even the day for photos itself but finding new clothes, buying a tripod to take photos on my own and figuring out how it works, thinking of locations to go to. I don't even do grocery shopping anymore because I don't like how it puts me behind on my work. I work 7 days a week. If I take a day off or even half a day off, it inevitably screws me over and puts me behind on work. 

I talked about this with my therapist last month but he was totally unhelpful and compared me to other clients. For example he said ""I had a client who had no personal life for 5 years because she was in psychiatric residency. I bet she was working harder than you. Everyone is suffering, you're not special."" He also told me a lot of his clients struggle professionally and I shouldn't complain because I'm good at what I do. I told him that was unhelpful, but WTF can you even say to that? Only reason I tolerate it is because I've known him for a long time and he has positive sides, but sometimes he has these moments where I just don't get how you can think saying that is useful.

I’m sure I don’t have to tell you how difficult this is during your 20s and in the dating world. I’ve met and hit off with lots of women but the second they show interest I kind of just push them away because of this problem. To say it’s depressing is an understatement. Here I am in my early 20s, where I looked forward to experiencing this intimate act only to be utterly disappointed. 

I know there are other ways of sex besides PIV but I’d say to the average woman my age it’s a dealbreaker I guess I’m looking for any advice in terms of when to bring up my condition and how it break it to a girl I might like. Also if there are any others that experienced this, I’d appreciate any tips of how you got through it.

I’ve tried all the doctors and seen urologists but found no luck. It’s not something curable or treatable.

My friends get in and out of relationships and I am always on my own there, just hoping for the best like a little kid hoping for rain in the desert in the summer. The thing is that it seems that in my post-apocalyptic world water does not seem to exist. Water just exists in the luckier worlds that I get to see from afar. I sometimes wonder why I was born just to suffer desiring companionship when companionship is not something that is in the cards for me. It feels like my life is a dark humor comedy. All my life I have struggled with bullying and racial discrimination and that has taken a huge toll on my self-esteem. I see couples happily talking down my apartment hall day in and day out. I can see couples walking all the time down through my window in the city. And old lil me just constantly gets ghosted online or just gets ""wish you the best"" or ""you are such a great guy someone else will appreciate you so much"". I am just so tired of this. It just feels like my body just drank a gallon of bitter despair, spiced up with sadness and a drop of cherry anger madness. I can hear from the distance the ageless platitudes of ""work on your self"", ""just hang in there"", ""those guys who are getting girls put the effort"", ""stop complaining"", ""man up"", ""you just need to find the right person"" and all that jazz. I honestly feel that the people who give advice do not know how horrible it feels to feel that no one will ever love you. You guys probably had a gf before. You probably came out of a bad relationship. You probably just get constantly harassed by your good looks. I would honestly trade my situation with yours any time. Just to feel one day, just one day that I can be loved and that I am not a hopeless mistake from a hiccup that evolution had will make me feel that I can at least be happy someday. To me it many times just feels that people give advice to just prevent other people from offing themselves, but they honestly have no clue what they are talking about, or they just cannot understand how painful it is and feel that other people are just exaggerating or whining, like how people feel about people who are depressed.

A week later she messages me stating that she wants to meet up and apologised for her reaction to me stating that I’m serious. We met up and had a good couple of hours of food &amp; convo. Then I asked her if we’ll meet again and she said she’s not sure about it.

When I talk to my brother he can’t give helpful advice. He got the good looks and confidence and charisma. His advice is just useless because you have to be good looking for it to work.

Girls generally find me attractive, I definitely get a lot of compliments, looks, and I usually have many girls around, but every time, I fail at going at the target

Every time I go close to do anything with a girl, I miserably fail, either by another guy stealing the girl, she suddenly losing interest, or by fucking things myself, believe me, always when I'm at 90% of things done and I cannot stand this anymore, it's like someone launched a spell to me to make me fail every fucking time


This is making me feel really depressed, because I see even the most ugly or shy guy getting girls, getting laid and I have like a success over 100 chances

I know it's very vague this way, but I needed to talk about it and I tought to write this here


Last example, last night

We went out with friends, there were four girls, two I was attracted to

With one, I previously tried and failed before kissing her, she ended up with another guy in front of me yesterday

The other girl, never directly tried with her but strongly displayed interest to me, I was almost at the target last night but she ended up with a guy met at the pub yesterday

Me, Aubrey, and Jessica were inseparable from the time we were in junior high all the way up until Jessica started dating Jack. I had a crush on Jack from the moment I laid eyes on him. I didn’t try to hide it either. Aubrey knew right away. I even told her once when we were about 14 that I was going to marry her brother some day.

I started dating Jack when I was 16 and he was 17. It seemed like he finally took notice of me and he asked me out. I was so happy. I dated Jack my last two years of high school. We stayed together when he joined the army, and I started college. We’d get together every time he was home on leave. 

After he came home and I graduated we got more serious. We moved in together when I was 22 and he was 23. For a while things were good. Then I started to feel like we were drifting apart. We wanted different things in life I guess. He wanted to start a family someday. I felt at the time that I didn’t want kids. Our jobs kept us apart too. He was busy training to be a carpenter and I had started my career as an RN. 

About a year after we moved in together we ended up breaking up. What a heartbreaking time it was for me. For him too I guess. At leas the said he was heartbroken. We went no contact and I didn’t see or hear from him for almost six months. 

Then I started to hear things from friends who said they’d seen Jack out with Jessica at places. At first I scoffed at the idea. They must have been hanging out with Aubrey, right? Then I heard that one of my cousins saw them holding hands at the mall. So I called Aubrey who said it was news to her. But we compared notes and realized that Jessica had seemingly dropped out of both our lives over the previous few months.

Aubrey went and confronted her brother about it and he said yes, he had started dating Jessica! Aubrey was furious with both of them. I felt complete betrayed by Jess. How could she do this? I finally worked up the nerve to ask her and she had no answer. She said it started with Jack pouring his heart out to her about me breaking his heart. Then she said they started spending more and more time together and one thing led to another. Less than three months after we broke up he was already banging Jessica.

I wish I could say I kept my cool with her but I didn’t. I went off on her. I told her our friendship was over and I told her he was just using her to hurt me. I truly believed that was what he was doing. I called him and told him off too. I said pretty much the same thing to him. He denied it and said he loved Jessica. I told him I hated him and that he was trash for using my  friend against me like that.

Aubrey sided with me and stopped talking to both of them. I begged her to please not end her relationship with her brother over me. She said she was just too mad at him to even talk to him. She also thought he only did it to get back at me.

I don’t know how much Aubrey talked to them. But a year after they got together Jessica had a baby girl. I remember being shocked that it had happened. Jess had always been another person who said she didn’t want kids. After the baby came I think it broke the ice between Aubrey and her brother. She told me that the baby was beautiful and the two of them seemed legit happy. She said the baby had Jack’s blue eyes and Jessica’s dark complexion and hair (she’s Mexican). I could tell Aubrey was really in love with her niece.

Over the last few years I’ve avoided the subject of Jessica and Jack when I am with Aubrey. I moved on and dated other people. I’ve had a couple long relationships but right now I’m single. Then last year Aubrey told me that Jack had proposed and Jessica accepted. The she said Jess had asked her to be a bridesmaid. I knew they had repaired their friendship somewhat because of the baby. I know Aubrey adores her niece. I can’t be mad about any of that. But it did sting a little. The three of us had spent hours talking about our wedding days and how we’d be each other’s bridesmaids.

So yesterday was their wedding day. I don’t know how to feel. Part of me is still hurt over what happened. I can’t lie. It does hurt. And Aubrey told me once it seems like they’re genuinely happy. I know it’s petty but that hurts too. They’re both happy and I’m single again. She was really trying not to bring them up much but sometimes they would come up. She told me that right now Jess is pregnant again too. So I do wish for their kids sake that they have a long and happy marriage. But part of me is still hurt over the whole thing.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1093538,public,self,Today,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qepks6/today/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

I am dating with a guy. He is less expressive, less talkative, very practical &amp; logical. I am the one who is emotional &amp; a bit practical in my professional life. I have a tendency of saying ""sorry"" when there is my mistake or even not! Becuase what I think is saying sorry is not bad if needed or if you want to close any aggressive conversation. 

So my question is -- I asked him a normal question like --

 he has work today or holiday? 

because he works in hotel so has to be available there 24/7 , sometimes he get holidays but those are not fixed ones. 

Then he said yes he do have work &amp; he is busy. &amp; On that message i said sorry &amp; ttyl to him.  &amp; Then his text was like -- why did you say sorry? 

This particular question I get from him whenever I have said sorry to him. I mean why he is not taking my ""sorry"" normally? Why he asks me this question? 

I tried to ask him but as I have said he is less expressive.
