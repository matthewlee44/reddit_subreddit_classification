We connected instantly. He checked every box I had, including his last name (long story there). We exchanged numbers and met up for drinks the next week. I explained to him that I had been in some bad relationships where people have lied to me and all I ask is the truth so I can make my own decisions.
 He told me some “truth” about his living situation - not married to but temporarily living with an ex; working 2 jobs to save money to move because he had had a terrible car wreck last year and was recovering. I took that all at face value and for consideration.
He expressed interest in me and wanting to spend time. He knows I like sports; so it pained me when he posted a pic on social media of him in  a bar on game day. No invite? Should I have expected one?
I left it alone. 
Understanding how long weeks can be when you’re working 2 jobs, I texted him a couple times during the week to “check in”. Sometimes he would respond, sometimes not.  He was definitely not offering to see me or take me out.
I feel like I am wasting my time on this person who is my ideal match.

We’ve been getting to know one another for alittle over 2 month now and it’s been going well. I’ve been dating for 2-3 years and it’s been a shit show. Mainly online but some in person yet all of it has just been chaotic and exhausting. Some narcissistic types, emotionally unavailable, ghosting. I know many of you can relate. On top of all of that I was coming out of long term narcissistic abusive relationship so I’m def dealing with some trauma. 

Ok, so in comes Joe oh wait I said his name was John lol.

Anyway, we met online. I invited him out after chatting for a week or so and we’ve been seeing eachother ever since. 

The problem, he’s very open about his feelings while I tend to freeze when it’s my turn to share. I’ve never experienced this before (freezing
up). I’ve also never dated a guy that I actually liked who displayed and expressed emotions so early on. It has happened with guys I’m not really into or attracted to and I have no problem being expressive. 

I want to open up more but I almost always freeze. Ex: he asked me what I wanted from him from dating or just in general and I couldn’t answer him. This is after he told me what he wanted. Or he’ll just randomly tell me how much he likes doing whatever is we’re doing or the feeling he has in the moment bc of what we’re doing (sitting on the couch watching tv, driving w me shotgun). I think he knows that I like him but I don’t share as much as he does and I’m afraid he’ll lose interest or interpret it as me not being interested or too damaged. 
The problem for me is fear (I think). Im just afraid that he’s not who he says he is (all talk). Im afraid he won’t be around in a month or two. Im afraid he’ll abuse my vulnerability. I’m trying to remain conscious of my anxious attachment and realizing he’s not any of the guys from my past but as many of you know it’s tough. Like, I’m deathly afraid of being hurt or played and I can’t get out of my head. I do tell him nice things and express my feelings sometimes but it’s soo unnatural most of the times. I have to force myself and let me tell you, my heart races each time.

Also - neither of us want to get married again, but we agree that the type of relationship we are building is lovely, really only lacking in time available together in person. 

My question is likely directed towards men. Having been off the market for 20 years and being a very open, heart on sleeve person... This ""keeping a man interested"" thing is something I don't know how to address. Thousands of articles out there tell women to let him chase you, don't text back right away, make yourself elusive and mysterious to drive him madly in love with you - and if you are too available, too open, ""too much""... He loses interest.

Is this actually true? It seems like a silly game that I just don't know if I can play. If I like this guy, of COURSE I want him to know!  I DO jump at the opportunity to see him, to talk to him when he texts or calls, to offer help if he needs it (and space when he's busy), and just let him know how much I care! That seems more natural to me than anything, and I know he wouldn't bullshit me by being unnatural either.

Anyway, we had a brief text exchange yesterday that was the product of 2 upset people who don't know each other very well trying to make sense of the situation in 159 characters at a time.

I'm really torn about contacting him again- it's such a bad sign that we had such steep conflict on the 3rd date -- right? Should I just let it be?

Well maybe here’s your chance?  Looking for a date to accompany me at a wedding.  It’s in the near future, so trying to get a head start on finding a date.  Also it’s in Atlanta so if you’re not close (which I am not either) then it gives plenty of time to plan travel.  

I’m 39, rather not talk about why I’m now Single, 5’4.  I love desserts and anything fruity so that’s where I lean towards food.   I am talkative once I know someone well enough.  

I would like to find someone that’s 45 or up.   It’s sad I have to say this but please be single.  Prefer someone mature, can go with the flow.  Open to learning about different cultures and won’t make ignorant comments. More than likely the food will be spicy so there’s a fair warning on that.

I KNOW in my heart that I want to shower this guy with my affection, love and enthusiasm, because I believe he deserves it - and it gives ME joy too! 

And giving things more thought after our nightly chat (he calls me every night that he's away for work, so sweet!) I think the thing that stuck out in my mind was that, I TRUST HIM to be honest with me, because he's already proven he CAN be. He's an introvert, and if he needs space or time away from me, he can ask me! I'll happily give it to him because - even at this early stage, I know this is a need of his. (Mine too - but because of life at the moment, we don't see each other enough for me to want a break from him yet!)

 But he's not ASKING for me to ""give him space"" by waiting on his texts or being busy... HE reaches out to ME most times, and I just enthusiastically respond and give him ALL of me because he's so delightful!

I trust him, and I will trust my intuition by just continuing to give all I can. And thank you again for all the support and reassurance that I AM doing the right thing!

I know it sounds extreme, but I feel like I have exhausted every single man in my dating pool. Same guys on every sight. Occasionally someone new. I had high hopes for someone I was involved with recently. Then I told myself if this does not work out, then I am moving. So here I am. I live in an area where most men are married and stay that way. Moving to a tech hub where there will be more men all around. I feel I have watched my friends on FB be married to spouse 1, get divorced, get married to spouse 2 and I cannot even get to the relationship stage. I don't have family here anymore, I can work anywhere, live in a 4 bedroom / 3 bath house with only the dog, so why not?

During one of our conversations, she told me that she has had a lapband procedure done and has lost over 100 pounds. She seems to have some significant side-effects related to the procedure. A corrective surgery was done around five months ago to repair something that went wrong with the initial procedure. The repair surgery involved removing some ulcers as well as part of her stomach or intestines (I can't remember which). She is still learning what she can and cannot eat and experiences nausea, headaches and sometimes goes days without being able to hold down anything but water and soup. A follow-up procedure is scheduled with her Doctor to look inside for a root cause (I can't remember the name of the procedure).

We seem to be very compatible, but I'm concerned about her health. Life happens and I understand that things that are out of our control can happen. I'm just concerned about entering into a relationship with a woman that could possibly have significant long-term medical issues. I'm wondering if I should move forward at all.

We have so much in common, despite that I’m 10 years his junior. He’s attractive, smart, well spoken and such a gentleman. 

1st date we went out of coffee and ended up together for 9 hours.

2nd date we go to lunch and spend 6 hours at the restaurant. 

3rd date I invite him to my place to watch a movie. We watch the movie. Nothing has happened physically at this point. He is getting ready to leave but doesn’t want to risk leaving without a kiss so he asks me. So we kissed and it was no little peck. We made out for quite some time. We didn’t have sex. Mostly over clothes. But it was hot. He got speechless at one point and said “less talky, more…” (I literally asked him if was liking it). 

Anyways, he was giving me long kisses the whole way down the stairs as I walked him out. Thought we were on the same page. 

Yet I haven’t heard a peep since. 

Yes I realize it’s only been a day since contact, but that’s the first time it’s happened since we matched. Even when he was insanely busy on a work project, he still reached out. 

Do you think I scared him away? It just doesn’t fit his M.O. at all! He’s usually such a gentleman and thanks me after dates etc. I’m kind of offended that he hasn’t said anything. I’m not playing games but I’m also not chasing someone. 

Am I right in questioning if he’s had second thoughts? I’m used to being ghosted by an ex of mine, so maybe it’s biased my thinking. 

I’m curious what you all think. 

My shrink tells me I give too much of myself. And has suggested that I demand better for myself. To not give romantic partners a bunch of chances to prove who they are. I’m conflicted tho. He’s clearly fine and posting on fb, but he’s not texting the woman who was grinding all over his lap.

TL;DR: Health problems caused a two month break in casual dating. How to know if it's over or to re-engage?

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I (42M) met her (34F) about 6 months ago OLD. It was the first dating either of us had done since the start of the pandemic, and I suspect for her the first dating she had done in a couple years. Our first date was end of May and we went out every week or two through August. The dating was what I would consider casual (no discussions about relationships or ""us""), though we were texting daily, and there were some weeks we'd see each other more than once.

At the start of September through now, there's been a precipitous decline in the frequency of our messages. We both went through a period of ill health starting in September that went into October, so this was partly to be expected. My health problems kept me homebound, making it impossible for us to go out (though she could have visited me if she wanted), and her health problems were both physically and emotionally taxing so I didn't expect that to happen. So, I tried to continue to check in with her and see how she was doing, and how things were going, sent her some flowers, but the time between our conversations has increased.

Our last conversation (via text two weeks ago) basically entailed me asking if she was ""okay"" (such as it is nowadays), she saying that she was, but that she was really busy with work and taking care of herself. At which point I asked directly if she wanted me not to contact her. She didn't answer that question directly, but replied that she had ""no emotional energy"" and wasn't even communicating with her friends atm. I replied that I just wanted to support her in the way that she wanted and respect her space.

Normally I would have interpreted her reply, and the subsequent lack of messaging as a defacto ""I don't want to see you again"", but previous to this she had always been extremely direct about communicating things like this. (If she was too busy to go out, she would just say she was too busy; if she wanted to come over, she would just say that, instead of angling for an invitation.) I also have been criticized by past partners for not being demonstrative enough in expressing my feelings, so I worry that I might not have directly communicated clearly my desire to date again now that our respective health issues are more or less behind us.

And so, I don't know what to do. The more logical side of me thinks that everybody has been clear enough, and it's just time to move on. The other part of me would prefer a clear resolution, since I would genuinely be interested in dating again if she's up for it. I also have been ghosted/the ghoster in the past and don't really want to participate in that.

I'm 42yo. I've always been generally successful with dating in that I get attention from women, seem to have no problem finding somebody I might like that's also interested in me, and often I'm pleasantly surprised by all the quality attributes of this person, including their level of physical attractiveness. 

I'm also newly single after a 4 year relationship. 

I've never tried the apps before but I've always been curious. I figured this was my chance!

I signed up for Bumble, uploaded some nice pictures of myself, wrote a nice profile in which I did state I'd be interested in a relationship, and then started swiping. 

The first day I was pretty selective. I read each profile and swiped right on maybe 10 out of 50. Admittedly, these all seemed like pretty amazing women. 

No matches. 

I figured, maybe I'm being too picky. Let's try being a little more open to matches other than the upper echelon of women on here. The next day I probably swiped right on almost half the profiles I saw. 

Still no matches.

I took a closer look at my profile to see if there might be any red flags that I was missing or something that was turning women off. I showed it to a female friend of mine. We both agreed that there were some lines that might turn some women off, but that's what you're supposed to do right? We can't all be for everybody. 

All the while Bumble was telling me that three women had ""liked"" my profile. I could see who they were for $17.99. I figured that I had either already swiped left on them or they'd pop up in my cue eventually so I didn't bite.  

The next day I swiped right on easily more than half the profiles I saw just to see what it would take to get a match. Still no matches. 

The day after that I swiped right on every single profile just to see wtf was going on... Still no matches. 

Are these apps rigged? Certainly I'm not entitled to women's attention, but it seems reasonable that I would at least get a handful of matches. I wasn't imagining I'd be the Prince of Bumble, but I figured I'd get somewhere between 5-10 matches relatively early in the process and we'd see what happens from there. But I guess not...  

I don't have trouble meeting women IRL. I get approached when I'm out on a semi regular basis, which I know almost never happens for other guys. I have lots of female friends that drop hints my way. I'm the one in my group of guy friends to where they're usually asking me ""how do you do it?"" with regards to meeting women...

So it just seemed strange that I would be on one of the apps for close to a week and get zero matches.

Recently he has asked to just be friends with no benefits cause he wants to try dating. Truth on the table - of course I had developed feelings for him and he knew it. Everything was out in the open and I made the choice because it was fun. Fast forward- we traveled together for a weekend and I got super jealous because he was on his phone texting with this new person a bit more than I was comfortable with. He did tell me, I’d have him to myself the whole weekend and I was delighted at the prospect. We argued and it wasn’t what I wanted and even though we are friends and he can talk to whomever he wants, it still kinda hurt. I took responsibility for my jealousy and here we are. He says he wants to be friends but we really haven’t seen much of each other as friends since our trip. I have been a little overly emotional with our new dynamic but recently we discussed trying to get together. 
I suggested this in a text - You could meet me at the gym and we could do the rowing machine sometime after I box if you ever wanted to -

Next morning I go to the bathroom walk into the bed room and she's just staring straight ahead sitting in bed. Says we need to talk.

She then tells me we don't have much in common, the conversation tends to run dry and she wants to take a break from seeing me?

So I’m 40, divorced with 2 kids. I feel like at this age, for me, I’m not looking for your traditional relationship. When I was younger the ‘goal’ was to find someone to fall in love with, get married , build a life and have babies. Well I’ve been there done that now. At this point I have the house, I have the kids, I have the career, but I don’t want the bullshit of an actual relationship. Yes life can get lonely and we all have needs so what I did was join FetLife. Before I joined I thought it was for fetishes and it is but also isn’t. It’s basically a hook up website for whatever your flavor is. On my profile I state I’m looking for a fwb with an emphasis on the friendship part, I want the spark and the attraction that makes for amazing sex, and that’s it. Well holy man… my inbox is flooded with men who want the same thing. Once you take all the head games and worry of dating out of it, wowzers it’s a whole new ball game. 
For me, it was the right thing to do. I always used to get this anxious trapped feeling with dating. I don’t want to be tied down to anyone yet still want to have fun. And it doesn’t mean sleeping with a bunch of people (unless you want to).

I met a guy in 2014 through work.   We were interested, but held back so that it wouldn't cause issues at work.    Then we moved on and weren't connected professionally anymore and he'd check in with me occasionally.   We lived in the same city, but he was going to other cities for months at a time for construction projects.    

In 2016 we reconnected and figured out that we'd both be in San Francisco in July so we planned to meet up.   We were texting a lot and I was really excited about the date and the prospect of going out to visit him for the duration of his project.    We planned to meet on a Saturday and on Friday I texted him to confirm.   Twelve hours later, he said, ""of course.""   No explanation or apology for how long it took him to respond, which bothered me, but not enough to cancel.

I flew out with some coworkers, we got settled into our hotel, had a drink and they were going to dinner and I was excited about my date.   As of 2 he was telling me that he was working, but would finish up around 4 and take the train to the city to meet me.   I didn't get another text until 5:17 when he told me that he was stuck at work and I shouldn't wait, that I should ""go on without him.""   

I was crushed.   I was really looking forward to this and I thought he was too, and now I was alone in San Francisco on a Saturday night and too humiliated to meet up with my coworkers who'd already left for dinner.   I texted him again the next day and got no response.   I went back home days later without hearing a word.

I texted him and said, ""I can only assume you're dead.   Rest in Peace.""   

After that he'd text me every 6 months to a year, and I'd always ignore him.    I never responded.   Fast forward to Monday, Nov 1, 2021.   He texted me again, and this time I couldn't help but laugh at the irony of him coming back during Dia de Los Muertos, when the dead and alive are supposed to be able to connect.   I texted him, ""Happy Dia de Los Muertos!""

It is regarding a guy I have been speaking with now for several weeks. As you read on, you will see quite clearly why I don't believe anything will ever come of it. I am also likely posting this in the wrong place, but we are over 40 and this is a ""dating"" scenario. 

He told me once that he will deliberately disagree with a woman in an emphatic way to see how she will respond/react. Whether or not he actually disagrees is a question I failed to ask. In my opinion, I find this to be manipulative and just plain rude. In addition to this, he said there was a woman he had been talking to for awhile and he said she disagreed with him frequently and he felt she did it just to be contrary, so he basically stopped talking to her. The other day, he said to me that he felt I was always challenging things he says. I found that odd, because I tend to agree to most of his positions on things, but many with a caveat....because I am not always sure what he means....at times, he will state an extremely polarized view on something, to which I will respond ""I totally agree with you, however, I feel that there is this other thing to consider as well""(because I am not certain whether he has considered these other facets of a particular complex topic). I am not saying it to challenge him. I am merely having a conversation and I suppose I thought conversations should welcome the viewpoints of all parties involved. 

Also, he said to me once that I was ""ADD"" a bit when speaking, like I was all over the place and couldn't stay on topic. The thing is, I do take bunny trails, but those bunny trails always circle back to the topic at hand. Then when that topic seems to have been exhausted, an aspect of the talk might remind me of something else and I will perhaps begin talking about that. This is how a conversation evolves, isn't it? And oddly, he does the same exact thing. And to add something else to that, he informed me that his ex used to always say he had ADD!! So what is this??

Another thing he does: He says he essentially sizes women up to determine whether they might have some form of mental illness. I find this also to be pretty messed up. 

He claims his ex was ""crazy"" and I wasn't there. I don't know here and so I have no way of knowing.

Custody is majority, her father gets one night a week, every other weekend. I have never really had any family help. I’ve always worked a full time career plus some. Needless to say, I never remarried and I’ve dated, but not many relationships.

My benefit is now my daughter can stay alone, so I can have a few hours one night a week when she is with me. I’m also flexible with her dad on that one night a week. We have a good relationship.

I keep meeting men with rigid minimal schedules with their ex’s so not flexible. And now I’m dating a guy who works overnights. And we have opposite weekends until January . It like impossible to figure out. He makes me feel like it’s me, but he works3-4 nights a week on which I can exchange with my ex. The one night he is off he has his daughter for a few hours, and the other night is not flexible due to kid activities. We do some morning /day dates. But night dates aren’t happening now. 

How do people do it? I haven’t been able to figure it out for 14 years.I can only be so flexible to a point. I watch others, but they have a lot of family help. I am pretty rigid on involving other men in my daughters life and vice Vera.

So I just suck it up until my daughter graduates high school? ( she’s a freshman) and figure I made it 14 years pretty much alone, that I can last 4 more?

5.

My partner and I, both early 40s (genders intentionally removed), have very different texting styles. My phone tends to be on or near me most of the time, and I'm usually pretty quick to respond and try to carry on a conversation. They don't always have their phone nearby, and even if so, might not reply as quickly, or sometimes not at all. They are also less emotive by text, to the point of occasionally seeming ambivalent.  This is just the way they are; it's not new over time, and I don't think it's just me.

In general, I'm happy to try to give them the benefit of the doubt (work, family, other people to talk to, housework, etc).  From a logical standpoint, I'm not the only thing going on in their life at that moment.  However, this also triggers an anxious side of me, kind of feeling 'less important', I guess, or perhaps distant/ pushed away, even though that's not really happening.

To be clear, this is largely a me issue (my expectations, my anxiety), not a them issue. We get along very well in person, and I know they care a lot about me. I don't think it's fair of me to expect them to change their phone habits for me, and I think that any change would probably be impersistent, because it's simply how they use the medium. So I think I have to get used to it.

So my question for all of you is how I might be able to think about this differently or approach it differently so as to take it less personally.

It wasn't the car photos, the shirtless selfies that are from ages ago, the bathroom photos, the photos meant to accentuate the groin, or the filters.

It was the list of demands that really got to me - I understand drinking, religion, smoking, and those other things that are actually items you pick your answer on FB dating.
