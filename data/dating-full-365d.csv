He was nice enough. Not a bad guy. But never gave me attention or really treated me like a girlfriend. Most of the time he continued to treat me how he did when we were friends.

My male friends said I smile too much when it comes to taking pictures, but I don't think so. Infact, I think they don't smile enough. However, I did read a study about men smiling in pictures can reduce their attractiveness. 

At first glance, this article seemed pretty bs. But then they did run some tests. In these tests, they gathered a group of women. And the researchers showed each woman two pictures of fairly attractive men. One picture was of a guy smiling, and the other was of a guy not smiling. Majority of the women voted the broody looking man more attractive. But one thing this paper doesn't take into account is social presence. In an actual social gathering, the women claimed they are more likely to approach the smiling man than the broody man because he seems more approachable.

It could be TW for abandonment tho. And I'm sorry for the long post 

So my bf and I have been dating for a little over a year and a half, and up to a few months ago it's been amazing. But a few months ago he called me at like 2 am crying and like saying he has to leave to a state a few states over (not gonna say the actual state tho) and I was super confused and very upset. He said something about having a fight with a friend he was staying the night with. And he left later the same day since it was 2 am. I stayed up all night with him. And got to see him for like 3 hours then he was gone. It's been 4 months, since he left we haven't talked much, and I really miss him. At first he said he was leaving only for a few weeks, then it turned into a month, then it turned quickly into 4 months with him gone. He sometimes sends me stuff. And since now he has a traveling job we both agreed I just keep stuff I want to give him in a box to give to him when he comes back. He says he wants to move back so we can actually start a life together. But I'm not sure he is telling the truth since he hasn't the last times he said he wanted to come back. I really love him, our relationship before he left was absolutely amazing. He never really lied or basically played me like this before, so I'm not sure why it suddenly started. I staight up told him before if he ever even truly thought about cheating to just end things between us, and he said he would never cheat because he knows how it feels to be cheated on and never wants me to feel that. I'm not sure what to do at this point. I've tried conversation starters, schedules to call or text, ignoring him to get him to actually talk. And he only calls me for less than a minute in the mornings and rarely after that. I truly have no clue what else to do at this point. Any advice or like different point of views would be amazing. I just only see my point of view and that could be a problem because maybe I'm seeing the wrong view. I love him so much. And I think he is the one. I just don't understand.

I mean to be honest even they wouldn’t have liked themselves the first hour of looking at themselves in the mirror. 

I miss the good old 2000s where this was much simpler. And in these covid times it’s even much harder to date. Tinder is just a platform which promotes superficial relationships. It’s a means for girls to say I like this guy let’s be friends and see how it goes , but I want to keep my options open with the other 100+ matches I have.

So, I had been on Tinder for a while, and I've met with one person on there but besides that I haven't had much luck. I also tend to overthink things and get self conscious a lot, so after having my account on Tinder for a while I wondered if I were to change up my bio and photos I was using, if that would help with finding more and better people on the app like me. Well, I did that, just the problem was that I had been on the app long enough that I didn't have anymore new people who were actually in the area popping up for me anymore. So, I came up with the great idea to instead just create a new tinder and start over, and see where that takes me. So, with my ""great"" idea, I deleted my account and went to make a new one, and when trying to use my number again it said I could not. I looked this up and I found other tinder users saying that making new accounts with the same number are not allowed by the app, and that you'll usually have problems and have your account banned if you do so. So, if you were to start over with a tinder account, you would have to change some things with how you set up your account and access it if you don't want it to get banned. It sounds complicated, but seeing how much more active Tinder has been for me compared to other apps I have used in my area, and I guess because of its better results and matches, I think it'd be worth it to try this. 

tl;dr
So, finally, long story short, I am wanting to make a new tinder account but I need another number to create this account with, and I don't know anyone who I'd really be comfortable asking nor do I have any other phone number, and online number generators haven't worked. Would anyone be okay with letting me use their number for making my account, I think the only thing I'll ever need or use the number for will be authenticating my account when I first make it, and then after that I wouldn't need to use it again.

If anyone would be comfortable and willing to help me with this, I really would appreciate it so much!!

Apologies in advance, it's a bit long.

This past weekend I traveled to Charlotte to meet up with a guy I met when I was out with my friends in Chicago a couple years back. We met on the dance floor, made out a few times that night and realized that unfortunately he lived super far away so we couldn't really start dating. Since we met the first time, I've only seen him one other time when he visited Chicago this past summer on a work trip. I sort of blew him off on that trip since I was seeing someone else (very early stages) at the time. I told him that we were going to do all these fun activities, but I had a one track mind with this new guy, so we only got dinner once. We stopped talking for a few months until he reached out to see how I was. I apologized profusely and let him know what the situation was at the time. A couple more weeks go by and he suggests I visit Charlotte to escape the cold. I agree and let him know when I'm going to book my ticket.

So this part is sort of important. Before I book my ticket I send him a text saying ""I'm not so sure I should visit you in Charlotte. I of course want to see you but I'm in a stage in my life where I'm trying to be more serious so don't want to overcomplicate things by going. Not really trying to mess around anymore so wanted to let you know what I was thinking."" He responds by saying something along the lines of, I totally understand and wouldn't want you to feel uncomfortable. My intentions were not that you could come as a trial to see if we would start dating or anything like that, because the distance is a real thing. I figured at the very least you could have a good time in Charlotte. 

Just for some context, I've had a pretty rough year of dating and what I said is true. I don't want to be used for a booty call or anything like that. This guy is super nice and a complete gentlemen so I never would have expected that to be the case, but wanted let him know my thoughts.

So, I thought that response was nice so I booked my ticket. I flew there last weekend and overall the trip was fun. We did lots of things, he paid for everything which was not something I expected, met some of his friends, overall had fun. The one thing is... he didn't touch me the whole time. We even slept in the same bed and there was zero spooning, light touching, anything! This is something that is pretty new to me so it left me feeling pretty shit about myself. It didn't exactly add up to his behavior because he seemed like he was into it, but then when it came time to unwind and go to bed he just laid next to me without a single touch. 

So I guess that's what my question is. My assumption is that he's not very into me and sees me only as a friend which is completely fair! I guess I just assumed most guys would probably be into having sex when there's a (pretty attractive, in my opinion) girl next to them. Either way, not a totally big deal since we live so far anyways. It's a tough pill to swallow but I'll be okay! I do wonder if that text had anything to do with it but I'm not sure. Maybe he misread it? Or maybe he's just not attracted to me at all, lol. Either way, I left very confused.

I’ve tried to distance myself from her since she started seeing her current boyfriend, but she makes it difficult.

We both work part time whilst at College, it’s just minimum wage supermarket work.
I only see her once or twice a week.

I catch her looking at me constantly at work, if I see her there’s a good chance she’s looking at me. 
I catch her looking at my hands or the veins on my arms, she looks me up and down.

I try to not initiate conversations as much but if I don’t she does.
If she sees me, and I don’t say hi, she does.

It’s never small talk.
If I walk in her direction she bursts into a conversation, it’s great because there’s never a dull moment, but it’s not what I need right now. 

One that stands out was a conversation where she was saying ‘imaging moving to the city, you’ve got a great job sorted, a lovely house, happily married with kids and then they start picking up that dreadful accent!’
So I pretendingly said ‘alright kids that it get in the car, your mother and I are moving you back to (my home town)!’
She laughed and said ‘or (her home town)’.

There’s been other occasions, she’s asked me what’s the youngest I’d date (this is before the boyfriend), I said maybe 20, but that could be weird it’d depend, I asked how old she was and she replied ‘oh I’m 20 but I’m 21 soon’, she was 21 6 months later. 

I know I missed a chance with her almost a year ago now, I didn’t realise she was asking if I was going to this event because she was genuinely curious or because she wanted to meet me there.
I never got her number, I never made plans and I was disappointed when I didn’t see her there.
I’m guessing she was disappointed I didn’t try to.

The reason I’m trying to distance myself is frankly it’s hard being around her when I know she’s happy with someone who’s not me.
She met her boyfriend at work, I remember hearing her giggling when she got a text from him after he had asked for her number.

I can’t just hang around her and burn up.
I won’t be quitting my job.

I can’t say anything because it’ll make it awkward.

Awkward because I don’t even know where exactly I stand with her.. 
part of me thinks ‘it’s just friends that’s all it’s ever been’,
Part of me thinks about how coworkers have joked that it’s like we’re dating, my supervisor who I’m friends with constantly makes jokes about it/us.

She’s lovely, and I like her but I find it hard being around her in this capacity.

Granted that did bum me out, but she said she really likes spending time with me and wants to keep seeing me without a label. So I asked her why she doesn't want something serious. And the gist of it was she doesn't know where her job will take her she is a dancer and ended up moving to boston after studying in NY b/c of a job opportunity.

I know that I want something serious in the long term but thinking about right now, I really like her and have fun spending time with her.

We saw each other since for some beers and ended up kissing. We had a great date just 2 days ago where we walked, and played, and kissed - he even made lunch and dinner for us!

We’re 9 years apart and I don’t notice the age difference. 34m, 25f. We get along like a house on fire, always laughing together. He tells me regularly ‘I laugh so much with you’, I know his friends, his family know about me but we haven’t been able to meet due to Covid. He used to call his parents every Sunday but since we’ve been dating, it’s become less and less. We normally see each other a few times a week, sometimes less or more depending on our schedule. He invites me to all the 'big' things in his life, for example, we were going to go to his medical ball together (he would've been seen with me in front of other girls if there is anything nefarious). When we drive or hangout in different areas together, he likes to look up the prices of houses. He's also said in front of me how cute kids are and that he can't wait to do that one day. Signs to me he's testing my reaction and seeing if I want that as well.

A few months into dating, he asked to make sure that we’re not seeing other people. He isn’t into casual sex and I think exclusivity is important to him. A few months ago I was anxious about what we were - he hadn’t asked me to be his girlfriend and I thought this is something that he would’ve wanted to do. He’s traditional, wanting something serious such as marriage/family. We had a few talks about the direction of our relationship, he said there were a few things he was a bit concerned about, a few things we maybe didn’t have in common (he’s very risk-averse and overthinks everything).

He’s studying so after that conversation he said he would decide at the end of his exams, his exams have finished now. He went away recently with some of his University friends, he was unsure of whether to go (seemed like he wanted to be with me, haha) and wanted to see me before he left. I’ve felt good about everything between us post-exams as I had a feeling he was going to slowly contact me less and less and try and see me less - due to his uncertainty.

One night on the phone, I told him that I wasn’t quite sure whether continuing to have sex with him was a wise idea as we aren’t boyfriend/girlfriend. He was confused that I said it was casual. I said ‘well, we aren’t in a relationship’ and he said ‘you are my girlfriend’ I’m certain he went onto say ’I thought we’ve known this since we started dating’ so I then asked him ‘well if I was to meet a new friend of yours that I haven’t met, would you introduce me as your girlfriend? And he said yes. Unfortunately, he has to repeat his exams so I may not be able to see him for a while, I do need to clarify that he actually meant this.I just wonder why he had this hesitancy a few times when we had the discussion a few months back though? There was even a point where I suggested we should end things because he wasn't so sure and he agreed. Maybe this is natural though and a reflection of his risk-averse attitude about things. There were just some uncertainties on his part. He said he could've been overthinking it. As a result, it sort of made me more anxious and I suggested we should end it.

He said it’ll be good to have a proper chat about things as we’ve both been putting things off, as so he said.

I got to his house, he said yes I have been his girlfriend all along and he doesn't know why I would think otherwise. He said that he feels it’s not going to work because of our age gap and he claims we're very different people. I personally do not see this as I feel like we share the same values, we're compatible in a lot of areas etc. He told me that he finds me beautiful, loves my sense of humour and that we get along and have fun together. I did mention that we handle conflict differently but our only arguments have been over text/call and since that's such a poor form of communication - it's hard to tell.

He started to cry (this is the most emotion I've seen from him), saying he won't be able to cook me any more dinners and our memories shared together. He then went back and forth and said he doesn't know if he's making the right decision, that he will never find someone like me, I am out of his league etc. He said maybe he's just one big idiot after all and he's made a stupid decision. I was calm in my response and he said ""why don't you get angry? this is making it more difficult"" in a somewhat cute way. He just kept saying that lately everything has been solidified in his brain that it's probably the most responsible decision. He asked me if I thought he was being unreasonable.

Now I feel like since we've been arguing quite a bit the past few weeks and he's been stressed, possibly his decision is skewed. I hadn't seen him in 2 or 3 weeks due to exams and I asked whether maybe we just got cold feet because of us not seeing each other. I remember months ago he said he sometimes questions us in absence.

We spent over 4 hours talking and it was like he didn't want me to leave nor did I. He then asked if we should go to dinner together. He finally walked me to my car and he couldn't stop crying.

Something in me decided to message him the other morning after I left:Me - Morning 📷 I don’t know if messaging you is the best idea, but I hope you haven’t woken up too sad. If you ever want to catch up on neutral grounds, a coffee or lunch, don’t hesitate - I still consider you a friend. Even under these circumstances, it was nice to see you last night and I am saddened I won’t be able to have more of them with you. That’s all 📷Him - Morning! I was in two minds as to whether to message you with the same sentiment 📷 I feel very much the same. Like you say it’s always nice seeing you, and it’s hard for me to think we won’t be sharing more moments together. I really hope you’re feeling ok today 📷 Enjoy the rest of your weekend 📷Me - Aw, well if you’re keen to catch up in a week to come or a few months, let me know. I’m trying to not make this any harder for us but it is difficult. I didn’t react with anger because that’s genuinely not how I feel about us. I miss you, enjoy your morning eggs 📷Him - Will do 📷 miss you too, at least you can have your eggs with olive oil today 📷Me - These thoughts are best discussed in person but I’m not sure if that can happen and they’re weighing heavy on me. I do think we could work through the issues as I feel there are more positives than negatives. I am aware that the past few weeks have been pretty nasty for the both of us but I’ve been particularly harsh on you. If I don’t hear back from you, I will, of course, assume you do not feel the same way and will accept your decision.Him - I thought I did explain that although the last month or so has been really difficult, it hasn’t been the main reason why I reached the decision I did. Of course I’m always really happy to talk to you about anything though, so if you still want to talk things through naturally I’m happy to do that 📷He went onto say that he hates that he's upset me and that it's all really difficult for him but he **thinks** it's all for the best.

We caught up and went to the beach together. We had a good time, he just feels at the moment he thinks it’s the best decision, although he isn’t fully confident he’s doing the right thing. He said maybe in a year it’ll make more sense and we realise we’re fit for each other. He said that he told his mother we broke up and she got really angry. Something was quite odd, he told me his friend (who I know) broke up with his girlfriend but they’re back together. We then went back to his for a cup of tea and we talked a bit more. He admitted that he does get in his head a lot and could be overthinking things. Said again that he's scared he's going to lose someone amazing but feels it's the right decision **right now**. Again, I feel because I've been arguing with him over text lately and he feels overwhelmed. When I left, he said he wants to see me again in a week or 2.

We spoke on the phone and I told him it’s really painful catching up with him and I don’t want to feel like an option to him or being left on the back burner, he said that wasn’t his intention and he would never do that as he has too much respect for me. He said it was hard catching up with me recently as well. He said he agreed to catching up because he felt like it was something I wanted. We spoke a bit more and he said that if he has a change of heart in the future, he won’t just sit on it. He’ll tell me. He told me he hopes I know how beautiful I actually am.

He ended up calling/messaging me over Christmas and NYE. I do feel like I am the one who predominately initiates contact with him first, I’ve been sending him sort of lengthy messages and he claims he’s overwhelmed by it. Recently we’ve been having an hour or so conversations when we usually would never have that as he was never one to speak on the phone. He expressed doubts about our break up as per usual and said he’s probably one big idiot after all. He told me he’s been on 2 dates with 2 girls as I asked, said he’s sort of interested but it hasn’t gone anywhere. I was quite upset and he assured me he wants to stay single for a while, he also said it’s not like he even wants a relationship with them. He said to give me some context that there were girls before we met that he was interested but it didn’t go anywhere. I was quite offended because he went on dates with girls that he basically broke up with me for. He broke up with me over an age gap but then went on dates with girls my age? Makes no sense. He said it’s all really regrettable and then told me that it's not that he wants a relationship with these people and said they’re just friends he wanted to get to know better. He said he wishes I could see his phone. Near the end of the phone call, he got teary about the fact he thinks I'm so sweet and don't deserve this.

He said over a month ago that a catch up would be good to clear the air. He also wouldn’t directly answer the question when I asked if he just sees me as a friend. I’ve decided to pull back, but it seems like he wants to catch up. At the start of this month, he offered to call about something, I think he was sort of surprised by that as I usually am jumping at any chance for us to speak on the phone. He sent me a message about the date/time tba (which I didn't respond to) and then he sent me a follow up message about a week later saying “Morning, when works this week for you?” with a smiley face. He then said whenever is fine, to choose a day/evening and let him know. He then said he hopes my mother is doing okay. This was 2 weeks ago and I didn't responded. He sent me another message 2 weeks later saying he hadn’t heard from me in a while, was wondering how I am and asked if my mother is okay. I replied and I was friendly, but brief. He replied and said a few things and then said ‘we never caught up in the end, let me know if you would still like to’ we talked a bit more and then I told him that I feel he just wants to catch up to free himself from guilt and that we can only catch up if we both feel it’s best for us to be together. He responded with saying that he understands and he didn’t think it would still be really difficult but he understands and there is a bit of truth in wanting to free himself but he thought it would be healthy in general. Apologised for the pain he’s caused me and wished me all the best. I told him that I just felt him talking about clearing the air was ominous and I just wanted to have dinner with him and not talk about us. He said that he understands how that could have caused it and apologies and said it’s the furthest from how he wanted to make me feel. I didn't respond and that was 3 weeks ago now.

\*\*TL;DR\*\* ex-boyfriend broke up with me in November 2020. He cried a lot that day. He's expressed doubt and says he's probably one big idiot regarding his decision. We caught up a week after we broke up but I've decided to not see him for my own reasons. Lately he's been initiating more contact and has been quite persistent in catching up with me but conditions the catch up as 'clearing the air'.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,688849,public,self,Unsure whether my ex-boyfriend (35M) is still interested or if I (26F) should block and move on.

I [21M] met this girl [20F] a few months ago on discord, we hit it off really well but had little time to talk because of the major time difference. But we made it work, come to find out there is more to it then just that. She lives in Dubai, and she was raised as a Muslim. Her parents very strict and the only time she is happy is when she is talking to me, but in order for that to happen she has to stay up super late and talk while the house is asleep.

Before this point I’ve already had feelings for her, and would do anything it took to see her. Now comes the real issue, I want to bring her to the states to get away from her life she hates so much. There is a lot more that she deals with than I am saying but I would like to keep that private for the time being. The reason why it’s such a huge endeavor is I have to travel to Dubai, make friends with the family and father, then ask her for her hand in marriage (We already both do want that).

This already seems hard, but to top it all off it is a custom to give money and gifts to the family. The travel, stay and everything else is going to be super expensive already, but we do have some time. She knows she won’t be married off for at leased 8 months, and you can bet I’ve been saving every penny that I have.

I'm taking this into a different perspective as someone in the lgbtq community on dating apps.

First, I'm nonbinary, bisexual, and asexual. All things that have sparked some anger in matches. Mainly the asexual part which I understand why but still, have some respect people. I've never had a problem with getting matches either, I would say I'm a 7 maybe even an 8 on a good day.

People on dating apps are horrible. There's men who aren't very attractive or in shape and yet they expect me to be attractive and in shape. There's women who will text for a few hours then disappear and never speak again. There's couples who think I will have a threesome with them. There's people ""just looking for friends"". And don't even get me started on the people with no bio or those who don't even read my bio (swipe right on everyone yay!) and then get surprised when they see something they don't like.

As a nonbinary person who uses she/they pronouns, men are usually the ones asking ""why don't you just say you're a woman?"" because I'm somehow trying to be ""different"". They also refuse to accept the nonbinary part and continue to refer to me as a woman, girlfriend, female with bobs and vegana etc. after countless explanations that I do not entirely identify as female. As a bisexual person, I am expected to have threesomes or have a high body count which makes me ""gross"". This obviously isn't true and I'm not your threesome fetish. As an asexual, almost everyone thinks that I'm a virgin or that I hate sex or haven't had ""good sex"". I find it especially disgusting when men message me saying ""you just haven't had sex with me yet"". Yes that's true, I haven't had sex with you and I probably never will after that. Don't even get me started on the people who hate any and every part of the lgbtq community and think it's okay to threaten or belittle us.

My experience may be entirely different from someone who is just like me and they may love dating apps. I live in a suburban area and it's mostly conservative (not trying to be political, just many people put this in their bio so it's obvious). Being on dating apps has just shown me how horrible and judgemental people can be. I was even surprised when I matched with people from high school and found out how rude they actually are.

Needless to say, I have had some good connections with people that didn't really lead to anything but at least they were kind and accepting. I do want to be on dating apps as they're my only way of connecting with others right now but a part of me thinks it's better to just focus on school and my job. After all, there's only a few months until my campus opens up again and I may end up making better connections then.

1st time: we had planned to hang on a weeknight, but she had some personal issues come up and ""just wanted to be alone"". She called me later that night and we hung out for my bday that weekend.

On my birthday a couple weeks ago she took me out to eat and got me a present. She also brought up ""what are we?"" to align on where we are to which we agreed we'd just keep hanging out. She also slept at my place that night. 

2nd time: to be fair I asked her if she wanted to hang out on the same day I texted her and she said she had work to do that evening. 

3rd time: we hung out the night before and agreed to hang the next day. The next day comes around and she got her 2nd covid shot that morning. She was feeling tired but more or less promised to hang out the next week before she leaves for a long trip.

Last night I went on the phone with her and we talked about our days like usual and I asked her if she could hang out Wednesday before she leaves, she said ""yeah, we'll see not 100% yet"" and didn't really give a real excuse as to why. 

I got annoyed by this response and called her an hour later to talk and asked her ""hey, I've noticed a shift in energy between us since we had the ""what are we"" talk?"" ""Is there anything you'd like to tell me"". She basically said that no there's nothing wrong, we're still good and that she's been going through some personal stuff that's made her more irratable but it's not directed towards me.

We had a first date that lasted 12 hours and we had great stimulating conversations the entire time no awkward silences. She invited me back to her place after I took her to a few bars and we shared a bottle of wine. I pulled her in and started to make out with her and she pulled me into her bed. She kept jumping on top of me and even put oils on my body at one point and although kissing was out of synch I still enjoyed it because she was super cool and beautiful. Although I was enjoying our make out sesh something within me was holding me back from escalating when I know she wanted me to as she kept jumping on top of me in the bed kissing me all over, I just couldn’t take her clothes off and get on with it even though part of me wanted to. The next morning she ended up telling me there’s not romantic attraction on her part which was partly confusing because she was all over me the night before but I suppose my hesitation could have turned her off. She said although there’s no romantic attraction she had a ton of fun with me and would love to have me in her life as a friend. Anyways regardless of all of this, and that being the best first date I’ve ever been on by far and her being super hot, she was completely honest with her history and she explicitly told me she has never been able to keep hold of a relationship longer than 6 months and she dumps everyone so i don’t think of her as a relationship prospect for me. So although I am attracted to her intensely I don’t think I could ever date her because she seems she could be quite cold when it comes to long term romantic relationships and ends them rather quickly. I’m thinking because I’m not trying to get into a relationship right now anyways especially with her, that I could maybe be friends with her but I am also attracted to her so this is new territory for me. I guess I would like to know if I’m still possibly going to get hurt in the end even though I know deep down dating her would be painful without a doubt and that’s not in the cards anyways. Is being friends in hopes of dating the only thing that hurts you in the end?

I got engaged super young and after that split I got into another serious relationship right away. From 18 to 26 I had those 2 relationships, fully committed except for about 6 weeks. So when I was single again at 26 I took a year to figure out who I am on my own. I've had mental health issues since I was a kid  for the first time in my life I started to like myself. I had fun, went on the camping trips my exes would never let me go on, met new friends and my career started improving. Then I met someone new.

It blew up in less than 6 months. I blamed myself at first, but now I see it's actually a shared issue. Our worst qualities fed off each other and we wound up unhealthy. Now all I'm upset about is that I launched myself into yet another commitment instead of just enjoying my own company.

I'm at the age where I thought it would all be coming together if I did things right. Frankly, it's great that none of it did because I'd still be unhappy  and running on that same emotional treadmill. I now go to therapy, I just got a massive promotion at work, I'm planning a ton of camping trips for the summer, I cook what I want, and no one guilt trips me when I want a lazy Saturday after my 60 hour work week. I even called a couple schools to look at finishing my bachelor's. People around me are going out of their way to tell me they notice my energy and it feels amazing.

I think women notice it too, because I've never had them pursue me before and now I'm getting asked out to dates. I've only went on a few, but they've all been great because I don't care what happens, I'm not on a timeline. I have great plans for myself and if someone happens to be going the same way, I'll be thrilled to enjoy it while it lasts. I'm done changing for any reason other than making my life better.

I have downloaded tinder and I am getting an instagram account to see if I can meet people though common interest, but is there any other way of getting to talk to people where I get chance to know them before asking if they want to hang out.  I would quite like that in person interaction rather than just messaging out to people online.

I have never had a girlfriend which in some ways knocks me a bit but overall I feel I will be fine once I find out how I can find a platform or way to actually get to talk to women in the 1st place.  I only ever really feel comfortable once I get to know people properly first rather than feeling like I am forced to get to know them on a 1st date.

Shortly before we started dating, she hooked up with a longtime best friend of hers from highscool. He's a very good looking guy, and something about him I just don't trust. He himself is in a very committed relationship, but nonetheless.

My GF is always trying to get him to come hang out with us -- as in invites him to every gathering we have -- the other day he texted her to come check out his friends apt on a Saturday night, and she convinced our entire group of 10 to travel 30 minutes just to go to some place with this guy and his friend. She must have been staring at him the whole time, even as she lied on my chest. At one point he even called her out the room and they dissapeared for five minutes or so. I also felt like i noticed her stick her foot out to touch his knee to grab his attention, but didnt say anything, they just looked at eachother.

I also feel like whenever she facetimes him, she has to leave the room. The one time i was bed with her when she answered, she angled her phone towards me as if to alert him that I was there (Though that may be paranoia.. idk) Another time, I was wondering where she went t cause it had been a while since she left us and our friends in the living room, and I find her downstairs face timing this guy. She immediatley goes ""Hey im just charging my phone""...

When she first mentioned that they hooked up, she said she only gave him a blowjob because ""He's slept with so many people, why would i ever want to be one of them"" --- That to me is the biggest red flag of it all. Like who says that...

The thing is... This guy does and is doing alot better than my gf if im being totally honest. to the point where I dont really think he is all that into her, and more just saw it as an easy way to get a blowjob. My concern is that my gf has some feelings for him, that extend beyond their freindship. I think she is embarrassed or ashamed to confront those feelings because he has a not so great history (Went to prison for a couple of years)

Is it worth inquiring about whether or not she has some unresolved feelings for this guy? Or, does this just make me look weak and insecure. On the other hand, do I not both asking and just break up with her to save myself from any trouble this causes down the road. I dont want to lose her, I'm having a great time -- but i also dont want to actively disresepct myself.

Also, this girl likes me ALOT.. like alot alot. Is it really possible to be that into somebody and still have feelings for someone else? Is it ok for that to be a thing? I dont want to ask her to stop seeing this guy entirely, i dont want to be like that.

As lockdown in the UK is starting to wind down (permanently I hope🥲) I am starting to get back out there a little bit as its safer (online chit chat mainly for now).

I am 20 so in the grand scheme of things it is quite a young age to have had a parent die, it happened a few years ago now and I am at peace with the situation (although still greiving as I will probably be for a long time). The parents/family question almost always comes up in first dates but as a young person, I typically find that a lot of the people I tell aren't well equipped to handle the answer of my mother being dead, many of us are only starting to realise that our grandparents are finite beings!

My mothers death does not define me, nor do I have a complex about the situation. I just need an effective way to tell people without causing an awkward situation. If anyone with a similar experience could let me know how you approach it, it'd be greatly appreciated :)

She was in Russia when she first contacted me so when she got back she had to quarantine for a couple weeks before we could meet.

Over those two weeks we conversed pretty casually but she would leave me on read for hours and sometimes for a couple of days. This was already red flags as not even a week after we met she already didn't seem very enthusiastic about speaking. She knows how I look and said ""cute😆"" so I was left with the impression she was interested.

She said the reason she didn't respond for awhile was because she took a break from insta for a few days and every time we spoke she would ask questions and seemed interested. Last time we spoke she said she took a break from insta and said she wasn't feeling well and a couple days later she deleted all her posts on insta. I asked if her day was alright and no response.

 Like 2 days after, I saw she changed her profile picture but didn't respond to the text I sent her so again I think she's lost interest, but last time we spoke she seemed to be having fun talking. I asked if she wanted to go out the following week cause her quarantine would be over and she said sure so I was looking forward to it. I purposed for Tuesday but she said she didn't know when exactly and that she would hmu to tell me when she's free. So far still nothing. Yesterday I asked if she's down to meet up in city cause I would be there on Wednesday and no response, not even read.

In my opinion I think she is just ghosting but seems odd cause of the amount of times she said she took a break from insta because she wasn't feeling well but imo that could've just been an excuse. The thing that really makes me think there's something more is because she deleted all her insta photos because she generally seemed interested and why would she still show interest even after 2 weeks.

Hi there! I (30F) have starting going out with a guy friend of mine. It's going great so far. We haven't had sex yet, but i would like to have sex with him. However, I have never had sex with a man and really want to take things one step at a time.

Long story short- I was really mentally unwell in my 20s and mostly avoided relationships/sex (+ kind of afraid of men). I started dating more in my late 20s and had one girlfriend for 5 months. I've kissed 2 other guys but have never had sex with a man.  
I would like to tell this to the guy I'm going out with because I feel good and safe with him, but I'm not sure how to tell him or how he will react to my bisexuality and lack of experience. Any thoughts?
