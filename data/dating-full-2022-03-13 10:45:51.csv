If it's a choice, you can figure out a method for dating, but if it's a feeling...what the heck do you do?** 

To expand:

I (26F) had a heated discussion with my friend (36M) yesterday. He's been married before, and says he's been in love twice (but not with his ex-wife). We're both currently single and dating (just not each other. Tried that, didn't work.) 

I am of the opinion--at least, I used to be, now I don't know--that love can grow over time, and it's not necessarily really a ""feeling."" You find someone compatible with you, someone who wants the same/similar things from life and a relationship, someone you ""click"" with, and you *decide* to commit (when the time is right). You might not necessarily get lovey-dovey, bubbly, butterflies-y feelings for this person, but it's still a great setup for a successful relationship. 

He's of the opinion that love is more of a feeling, something that strikes you, something you can't control. You either ""click"" with someone (in this way, with this feeling) or you don't, and there's no controlling or forcing it. There are multiple types of love, and you can love your partner, but being ""in love"" is necessary to not be settling. 

He told me, and I'm paraphrasing, ""With your approach, you're focusing on yourself, what you want. But love isn't logical; if you try to control it, you'll destroy it. I've never heard you talk about being in love, just what you want out of a relationship. The people who have loved me told me they fell in love with me for stupid reasons, like just the way I do something, not because of something big or logical, like being a good father or something like that."" What I got out of this by the end of it, essentially: **If you try to find love by focusing on what you want, you won't ultimately be satisfied, partially because that's selfish, and partially because that's not how love works. Sometimes you love someone and they hurt you. You love them anyway. That's what true love is: you love them no matter what, not because of what they can do for you.** 

The truth is probably somewhere in the middle, or we are both focusing a bit too much on one aspect: I'm focusing on what makes a good relationship, he's focusing on what makes a relationship possible in the first place and possibly what makes it last. Like I said, he's been in love twice, but it's never worked out, because they didn't love him back the way he loved them, and also partially because he compromised himself (which he's working on). He could probably use a little of my approach, so that he finds a relationship where he's not mistreated or unvalued or left. I could use a little of his approach, so I'm not focusing so much on myself and ignoring the ""magic"" that makes love worthwhile and true. 

But I'm still confused...because what do I do now? If I need to have this in-love feeling, then how do I approach dating? How can I try to find a partner? I've focused so much thus far on figuring out exactly what I want and need in a relationship. How much of that do I throw away, considering the idea that being in love is not something logical, not something I can hope to create over time with someone who I believe would make a good partner?

It's the little things that make me doubt a relationship. I know that relationships require work and communication, but  when small things happen that bother me I start to doubt if we will last and break it off.  This all starts after the so called honeymoon phase.

I moved to a new country a year ago and have recently started dating (30M). We have been dating for three months, and I really like this guy. He's sweet, funny and genuinely cares for me. We've been on lots of dates, which he plans and I do as well. He will find restaurants and If I mention I want to do something he tries to find it for me. I love hanging out with him and he makes me happy.

BUT! Now its the but part, there are little things that have begun to bother me. They are very superficial and part of me feels bad about it. He doesn't dress well, and my friend said he looked like an old man. It didn't bother me at first, but now I think about it a lot. He has asked me for advice on clothes before, so I think that is something we can communicate about.

Second, because he is from a different culture we have a little bit of opposite views on issues. His country (Korea) is not very progressive for women rights. We can have adult conversations on things, and I did change his mind about mental health issues. He supports abortions and some women's rights, but he seems like a general man when it comes to female issues. Does that make sense? How do other women deal with this?

Now that the honeymoon phase seems to be coming to an end, I start to notice small things. I can work on it, and I'm sure there are things about myself I can change also. Is it even worth trying to work things out? I think they are, but it just feels like I always have doubt when things start to get more intimate and serious.

**1) Livining in many different countries, but seeking something long term:** I am a 23 years old italian guy, currently studying abroad in Austria. However, I still don't know yet if I will spend my summer in Italy or in a country abroad (I am looking for a summer internship) and also in September I will move to Paris for 3/4 months of exchange semester. I feel like this will not be the only time in which I will not be living in the same country for a year, because I am really trying to focus on my career so I would literally go everywhere I find opportunities. Long story short: at the moment for me remaining in the same country for one or many years it's not something that I would like to do (until I am 24/25 I think). Considering this, maybe some of you would imagine me dreaming having many short term relationship or something like that, instead**, I am really craving a relationship that could last much time.**

**2) Long-distance relationships:** Considering what I said above, I am thinking that maybe having a long-distance relationship could be the ""solution"" to that thing. I know, I know, having a long-distance relationship is really something complicated, but anyway for the position in which I am right now, every relationship I would start would become a long distance relationship in few months time. Considering what I said above, it's 3 days that I am texting with a girl, I know, not so much time spent together, but we made a lot of deep talk through messages (friday night we were awake texting each other from 1.30 am to 3 am, something which was really lovely) and in general I am feeling like I am falling for her (if a person is the right one, then I can fall really fast). However, she lives in Slovenia. Considering this, her home is basically 2 hours and half of car away from my parents second home in italy, and 5 hours of public transportation (that's the method of transportation I would take) away from my place in Austria. I don't know what to do, I would really like to invest time and effort in this (one side of me is also thinking about going to Slovenia one of the next weekends) but at the same time **I am scared of the possible outcome in the long-term.** 

**3) Mental health is involved in this:** I have to admit that there are two things I really like of her, the first one is that she always joke and has a great sense of humour. The second one is that we share a really similar mental health situation. In particular, in the night we had deep talks we talked about our dramas, our traumas, our past, going to therapy and stuff like that. Talking about the dark side of people is something that really make me interested in someone because I feel like I am not lonely and in this particular case a side of me thinks that ""since she lived similar experiences, then she understands myself and this could positively contribute to a possible relationship"". For example, in our night of deep talk, we both expressed the fact that we have a fear of abandonment and I think that this thing impact our way of messaging in certain moments, like yesterday evening she was really sleepy and she told me that she was going to sleep soon and then she gave me the good night saying that she would have talked more to me tomorrow after her work (in this way she comforted me for my anxiety while making me know that tomorrow she has to work, I don't know if it was on purpose or not but it felt really great and caring). I don't know, **I feel like many of you would say that I shouldn't pursue someone who has her own mental health problems, especially while I am having mine too, but I am really thinking that this is something which helps me to build the kind of relationship I want (with really open and deep talking, caring a lot about each other).**

I wanted to share a story of hope. I am a 34f never married with no children who struck out for years with online dating. I recently met a 32m online (tinder!) who lives in Australia. I’m based in the US. I wanted to throw in the towel after a day or two of talking citing how unrealistic the situation was, but my mom encouraged me to see what happened. There is a 16 hour time difference and this man still finds ways to make conversation work. He video calls me every other day at the same time and texts me consistently every day. He never misses a good morning message or an opportunity to ask about my day. We talked for a few weeks before he said he wanted to plan a trip over here. It’s a roughly 30 hour trip for him. 

His flight got canceled and instead of waiting for the next flight on that airline he paid another $1,500 to fly out the same day/time to keep our plans. He got a hotel in my city (did not ask to stay at my apartment) and he planned the entire first night together. He picked the restaurant and time for a city on another continent. He showed up on time, paid for dinner, and held doors. We ended up being out for 8 hours that night laughing and talking and he made no sexual advances or comments. He knows that I’m very uncomfortable with strangers touching me and was very patient in waiting to make things more physical until I felt comfortable and safe.

Women fawned over him the entire time he was here. He’s very attractive, as well as educated and a home owner. Not saying these things should be deal breakers, only to say this man would not have trouble finding women at home or anywhere in the world and he still traveled 30 hours just to meet me with zero expectations. 

That stupid saying is true - if he wanted to he would. Three months ago I was sending my friends frantic texts wondering why a man I’d been on a few dates with was running hot and cold with me and I just found a man who planned a date - and all the details - for another continent.

We've been dating for 5 months total but became exclusive about 2 and a half months ago. He confessed that he was in love with me and wanted to be in a relationship.

As I've gotten to know him more, he's got a lot less relationship experience than it came across in the beginning. He had been in 2 relationships previously, one was close to a year long and the other was a couple months. But there were some unusual things I've found out over time. He never used any pet names (honey, baby, sweetheart, etc), never met any parents or brought either girl to meet his parents, and never had sex before. These are just a couple things to give an idea of where he's at experience wise.

I'd had a few issues with how he was in the beginning of dating. Like he gave the impression he wasn't interested romantically because he never gave me compliments on my appearance and didn't try crossing the physical barrier with me for what felt like a long time (he didn't hold my hand until 3 weeks into dating). But I chalked it up to him being nervous around me because both of those areas improved. And he showed his interest in other ways (making time to go on dates multiple times a week and losing a lot of sleep on work days) so I was more confident in his interest in me.

Things kind of changed for me after being together for a month. He really disappointed me on our monthiversary and on Valentine's Day by not doing anything for me either of those days. I specifically told him that they were days I cared about celebrating. They both fell on weekdays which I understood was hard for him as he works a manual labor type of job and does 10 hour days. But he didn't do anything on another day or weekend where that wasn't an issue. I had a lot of hurt feelings about it and I'm bad at communicating so I let it eat at me for awhile before telling him how I felt and why I was hurt. He made a lot of excuses at first then said I was right and called himself a terrible boyfriend.

Valentine's Day was only a couple weeks after and it was another huge disappointment. I actually made another post about it in more detail because I was considering if it was grounds to break up with him or not. Ultimately I didn't. I poured my heart out to him about how hurt I was and basically just got responses like ""I'm sorry I'm not good enough, I wish I was what you wanted, I hate making you feel bad, it kills me knowing I'm the source of your pain, I wish I wasn't an idiot, I'm not good at any of this"". That's well and good but I didn't want excuses or apologies. I just wanted him to try harder and show me he's doing things differently. Well nothing really came of it yet again because I apologized to him for burdening him with my emotions and we never talked about it again and nothing was really resolved. We just kinda moved on. No changes were really made either.

Part of me hopes he's not just a careless guy who's taking me for granted and that he's just really dense and inexperienced. There are a few things he's done or said that make me feel like I do mean a great deal to him but he just doesn't know how to handle things with me better. Some of these are gonna sound really minor but just stuff I picked up on. I know for sure he's scared to mess things up with me. He wants me to pick where we go or what we do because he always wants to do what I like. He worries that he says the wrong things to me so we don't talk about deep stuff that often in person. 

He'll pick me up or offer to drive us because I've said I hate driving and he doesn't mind. He always worries about me being cold even if we're making out and it's easy to get distracted, he'll pull my shirt down and smooth it back out or he pulls the blankets around me when we're in bed. I don't typically spend the night at his house when I go over either and even if he was dead asleep, when I move to get up he'll wrap his arms around me and tell me I can stay the night or he'll have his hand on my back while I put my shoes on. 

He's cooked for me a couple times and serves me before serving himself. One night he was taking his jacket off and he got all staticky. He touched the metal lamp and I asked him why was he doing that because he'd shock himself. He said he didn't want to shock me when he touched me. When I cook for him he doesn't sit down and wait he stands right next to the stove and oftentimes I've got multiple burners going or if I step out he keeps an eye on the food and helps me. He helps clean up and put things away. He made my bed and even picked up and folded my clothes that were on the floor from the night before. 

My car had really old wipers and I could barely see to drive one night it was raining and he got me new ones and put them on for me. He got a new toilet seat for the bathroom at his house because I mentioned the one there was old and uncomfortable for me to use. He'll watch any show or movie I want. He pays for a lot of our meals when we go out together and I recently found out he makes nearly half what I do (I've been paying more now that I know and I brought him homemade dinners 3 times last week and other treats randomly like cookies or cupcakes). One day I noticed he had the two movie tickets from some of our early dates on his bookshelf where he could see them from his desk. One night I went to his place and I was dead tired. I accidentally fell asleep during the movie we were watching. He kept looking at me with so much love in his eyes when I woke up, saying how cute I was and how much he liked getting to watch me sleep in his arms, he kept hugging and kissing me and being unusually affectionate. He even texted me the next day about how much he loved it.

I know that's a lot but I just wanted to show the other things I see that make me want to not just dump him. I do think he cares about me. But am I just being stupid?

I hit it off this one guy in December. I’ve known him since august and he’s always been laid back and sweet until about 2 weeks ago. He says what’s the point in texting him if there’s not anything important, I agreed, and then he said I try to appease people too much and then he asked if I would still like him as a friend. He proceeded to say that all our interactions together were drunk for the most part (we would party on the weekends last fall, I would interact with him sober too and we would go out to eat or just chill). He said the reasons why he lost interest (I swore in front of his parents in public, I laughed at him for falling on the ski slope) even though I apologized for these things numerous of times and checked to made sure he was okay. He also said my lifestyle does not work because I’m in the military and in nursing school despite him knowing this information since we met and him explicitly saying before he was okay with it. 

I tried so hard communicating to him. I wanted to talk things out in person so I can get a peace of mind and debate on whether the friendship is even worth it. He failed to communicate to me what was bothering him even though I asked. He says he wants to trust people but how are people supposed to trust him when he does this? I mentioned him things that bothered me (leaving my apt to smoke weed, not communicating to me, always putting me on hold). He proceeded to tell me I’m not the only one in his social circle, that he didn’t get to talk to other girls since he has been hanging out with me (this wasn’t even remotely any part of conversation). He dodged a lot of questions (whether he used me for sex, etc) 

I’m not bothered by the fact that this did not work out romantically; im bothered that he thrown so much out at me at one sitting AT 4AM. That night I did not sleep. I want to make things right to him and show him I care. I feel like such a bad person. This has damaged a lot of my self-worth. When I expressed that I wanted to talk in person about it, he called me over dramatic and said he just wanted to clarify that we were never dating (even tho there was obvious couple shit lmfao) Maybe this is just his true colors.

He is my first boyfriend and the first person I’ve been sexually active with. We are in a LDR so we’ve only had sex less than a handful of times. With everything being my first time, I was scared do things like oral sex. He never pressured me to do anything but is now saying how I didn’t even try to touch him. The reality is I’m a huge over thinker and the fear of doing something wrong and not being able to pleasure him got the best of me and led me to not do anything each time we had sex while he did a lot of work trying to make me feel good. Because I didn’t do anything during foreplay, we got in a huge fight and he said I have ruined his sense of self esteem leaving him feel ugly and unwanted. 

In addition to this, I’ve joked around a lot about how I like and prefer taller guys when we were friends and have commented on his height before. To preface, my boyfriend is around the same height as me. I didn’t realize my jokes were hurtful and insensitive and because of all this in combination with the lack of foreplay I initiated during sex, he believes that I do not love and am not attracted to him. This is not true, I love my boyfriend very much and have learned to look past his height and love him for who he is however he believes I am incredibly shallow because I talk about looks and height a lot. He doesn’t believe anything I say and says that if I loved him enough I would’ve pushed through the nerves that came up during sex. No matter what I say, he is convinced that I am not attracted to him and that I don’t love him because of how often I mention taller guys.

Because of me he says I have left him feeling ugly, unwanted, and unloved and that he no longer wants to have sex with me when we meet again next month. He thinks he is ugly because he is not as tall as the guys I mention (usually celebrities). I realize now what I said was hurtful and insensitive.

After one or several dates, I have sex with the woman, which starts off by getting undressed. 

But sometimes I don’t like their body (flabby, chubby, or not enough boobs etc). I find it impossible to pause or slow down at this point because of excitement (and I would think this is the same for everyone) so I go through with it, but I definitely somewhat disappointed as I have sex.  

I have extremely low inhibition for verbal communication while having sex. (I.e., I say anything). The pleasure dominates my brain and I say lots of things that I don’t really mean. I think this is the same for everyone to certain extent but I probably go overboard. Usually I end up over complimenting the other person (over the top) and greatly exaggerate my feeling. They are my emotions and feelings at that time but pleasure  always amplify my emotions. 

So after it’s over, I’m thinking lying on bed, she doesn’t actually turn me on. But I don’t tell her that. I tell her I had great time. (Which I kind of did, because at least there was sex), and send her home. 

From here there are two ways this goes, for the women that I didn’t really like their body 

Case A. I don’t send any follow up message and she doesn’t send me any message either. I call this mutual ghosting. 

Case B. I don’t send her any message but she sends me messages and keeps messaging me even if I don’t set up follow up dates. She slowly stop messaging me. 

I’m thinking, instead of these, can I just be honest with them and send them this message the day after.

He says that we get along so well so it’s not fair of me to reject him based on him being really into anime and thinking I look like an anime girl. He thinks I should give him a chance.

My best friend went through a break-up last summer with a guy she was together for 4 years. Ever since then, she's had like 6 one-month relationships. And after what she told me, I feel like she has lost herself, and that has led her to do things, I don't particularly agree with. She is putting out on first dates and insisting on guys to have unprotected sex. She isn't using any other protection as well and has had like 3 mental breakdowns because of a fall positive pregnancy test.

So the question is after how long would you even consider unprotected sex?(I'm curious to know, because I find her view on it incredibly weird)

The second question is whether I should try to explain to her how I feel about her situation, and if yes,then how do I even go about it?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163468,public,self,"Ladies, would you have unprotected sex with a guy, you've been seeing for less than a month ?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/td9g27/ladies_would_you_have_unprotected_sex_with_a_guy/,no_ads,0,,,

I complained to him for the 2 dinners including one birthday dinner I offered which cost me around 300 bucks and he dumped me afterwards. He made good money though he did not pay any dinners solely for us or gave me any gifts.

Last December we decided to go for a trip together. We have not met for half a year before the trip. He was very caring and happy during the whole trip, but he did not want to touch me at all. We did not even have any kisses and cuddles. I thought he was distant because we have not met for a while or he was in a new relationship (actually he did not see anyone). I did not initiate anything either because in the past he was the one to proactively initiate physical touches. I did attack him last year in terms of sex because I thought he used me for sex since we did not have a lot of real dates. He was mad at me and asked me to buy him another dinner. I rejected and he dumped me immediately. During our drive to the airport, he began to say I was cheap and I cried at the airport.

I really loved our interactions during our trip, so I sent him about 30 texts in one day to tell him how I felt about him and why something bad happened in the last year and he did not respond at all. After I requested a refund of unused ticket that he bought for me on Venmo, he blocked my Venmo and phone number immediately. He also profited more than 200 bucks from buying ticket for me. It hurt me a lot because it was more about principles.

From my perspective, we were quite compatible in sex (we had great sex last year), food, activities and personality. I love his vibe a lot. The only issue between us is money though both of us have enough money. I do not care money a lot.

I have 2 options here: 1) Send him text after one month to ask for a talk in person; 2) ask the money back through his sis

Due to my career, I'm never in the same place more than a few months. I travel around my country working with volunteer programs and nonprofits, and this'll be the case for the next few years into my late twenties. It's been an incredibly fulfilling experience, and I've learned and grown so much through my work. In the next three years, I'll be traveling for an international service program, and that's something I'm really excited for.

I won't take for granted the opportunity I've been given, this is my dream job and I've never been happier, but moving around as I do -and will be doing for years- means I can't settle anywhere. Friendships I make are with my coworkers, and relationships I have are shortlived by design. It's disappointing, because the end goal for me is a longterm partner. I am excited for the day I can be dedicated and loyal to someone, and we can support each other and grow together, and I won't have to think about how it will end.

So I have this fantasy:

While on the road or the worksite, I think about whatever my future partner is doing. I wonder if they are still getting their education, or if they are somewhere doing something like me. I think about how they're searching for meaningful work that they find important, and how they are growing and becoming someone that they're happy with. It makes me happy to think that they are somewhere on their own journey. I like to think about them, and how proud I'll be of what they've done with their life. I like to think that they are out there somewhere, with the same fantasy about me.

I think about how we are both becoming the people we need to be, and that we'll meet when we're there. It makes me eager to become a better person, just so it can come quicker. I think about how great it will be when I have the certainty to tell someone ""you're who I've been waiting for all this time, and I'm so glad we finally found each other"". We've become who we need to be, and from then on we can be a team. We can share the stories of how we got to where we are, and we can validate and support each other. We won't have to think about how it will end, because it won't have to.

I know it's naive or idealistic, but it isn't about imagining a perfect partner, as much as believing that there is someone out there thinking and waiting for me too. It feels like it validates my efforts, and it keeps me driven and motivated to be a better person.

I'm glad that wherever they are they are happy, and I am looking forward to meeting them one day so we can talk about everything we missed while we were getting ready.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1163471,public,self,I have this cute fantasy that I always come back to...,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/td9xtm/i_have_this_cute_fantasy_that_i_always_come_back/,no_ads,0,,,

&amp;#x200B;

Would want to share how my first relationship went. It was with this guy who is 6 years older than me, at first I did not know the age gap since he was my classmate and he looks someone my age. We talked and decided to hit it off, we dated for 3 years and it was a mess.   


When we started dating, I can start to see patterns of his behavior that I ignored since I loved the guy. Patterns where when he's pissed he starts ignoring me for days and weeks; I was reasoning it out at first, thinking maybe he needed to cool his head for a while and it's all my fault for ""demanding"" things as he said it. When I told him that I wanted to break up for I can't handle all the thinking that was given to me, he video called me and made me watch him strangle himself using a belt. I was crying my eyes out and told him that I won't leave him, he stopped.   


There were also instances when he shouts at me in public but never retaliated because I don't want to make a scene. That was when I called him and told him that I just wanted to be with him and find a place to eat where I can be at peace because I just want to be with him. He agreed, and when we got to the place, he started yelling at me for not talking to him when I just wanted him to be there... not talking... he even threw things in public so he can make me say something. I just picked up his things and have it to him like nothing happened. When I told him that I got upset because of that, he apologized and told me he won't do it again...  


Surprise, he did it again. We were still in college and was busy doing our thesis. He forgot his questionnaires at home (it was needed that time, and was our Midterm exam), so I told him to fetch it at home, he declined and said it was too late. I said I can go with him so the burden's not just on him, and I can contact our professor if we were late. He said that he'll get it on his own but I still contacted our professor. When he arrived, all the questionnaires were dumped on my face and he yelled: ""I TOLD YOU IT'S NOT NEEDED"", classmates saw what happened and I remained silent. He apologized and told me he won't do it again...  


Spoiler alert, he did it again. It became worst. I graduated college and he stopped studying and went to work. Now both working, we were both busy. Despite my tight schedule (my work + masters), I still manage to message him and send memes to ease the workload that we both have... I even requested for him to video call every once in a while while we do our work, it was okay for him for weeks; I don't know what happened but one time he yelled at me for calling him and even asked me: ""ARE YOU MY CCTV?! WHY DO YOU ALWAYS WANT TO CALL?!"", I decided to stop and told him that I don't want to bother him if he's tired. We never got the chance to meet (during pandemic), because of the risks and I don't want to press him further. He's into streaming and I supported him in every streams. I noticed that he doesn't have time for me anymore that's why I said that we should have movie dates or something... after stream, because I don't want to bother him whilst streaming... after his work, he sometimes would stream for 7 hours and when he's finished streaming he would call it a night and tell me that he's tired... told him I was upset because he doesn't have time for me anymore, he told me I was being dramatic.   


I forgot to tell you this instance... this was before pandemic, his mom invited me for her birthday party at the mall. Before going to the venue, I asked him what should we buy. We bought his mom a microwave since it's the most useful, he got so pissed because he carried it until we were at the venue... I was upset at that time because he was yelling at me and pointing fingers at me that it was my fault for making him carry the huge ass microwave when I told him we can carry it together. During the celebration, I was on the verge of crying but remained silent because I don't want to ruin his mom's party. When he was about to fetch me home, I told him I will just commute because I don't like how he acted and just needed the time to contemplate. He never took no for an answer and insisted he would take me home, I declined and he threw his helmet at me and kept yelling at the parking lot. Again, I don't want to make a scene, picked up his helmet and gave it to him and walked away. He yelled at me, can't take it anymore so I decided to make him take me home. We were on a motorcycle and of course, because I was upset, I was holding on the back part of the motorcycle. We were on the stop light (it was red light), he told me I should hold him but never did. When it was green light, went full speed that I was about to fall off... I don't know if he wanted to kill me or he just wanted to be held. Nevertheless, told him everything that made me uncomfortable. He apologized and told me he won't do it again...  


Last year, we broke up. It was very messy as well. He decided to not answer my calls and messages when all I did was to voice out my problems in the relationship. That was it. I decided to stop, blocked him on all social media platform, unfollowed his streaming page and everything. I cut him off... for two months... but decided to be in contact with him again because it was bothering me that we broke it off like that. I told him I needed the closure but he rejected me and even made me feel guilty. He said that I was asking for too much when all I wanted was his time... I knew the conversation was going nowhere and the closure I wanted will never be granted.   


Now, I'm taking therapy and I'm being better as well. A lot of things are being sorted out in my brain. I'm glad I am doing therapy after the messy break up, later found out I have persistent depressive disorder. Thank you for letting me share this on reddit. :) I hope those people who experienced some instances that I shared will get better! &lt;3 We will get better!

I'm a 30 F who has been online dating for too many years. I've never had particularly bad experiences, but the older I get and the more conscientious of what I want, the less I'm interested in prolonging contact. 

I've had a tendency to be ""open"" to see where things could go (aka afraid of hurting someone's feelings...), even if I didn't feel a spark. Most of the time when I leave the door open for friendship, that boundary isn't respected and I end up feeling obligated vs. interested in spending time with them.

I've decided to stop doing this and in doing so, I've come to realize it's best for me to block someone's number *after* telling them I'm no longer interested in seeing them. I only do this if there's clearly an imbalance in feelings (eg: other person is/was coming on way too strong) and/or I felt uncomfortable. I simply don't want to leave the door open for communication with someone I barely know. 

Most recently, I went on two dates with someone and he was pretty obsessive even before we met.

I sent him a long message saying it wasn't a match and I think he's a great person, etcetc then immediately blocked his number because frankly I didn't care to read his response.

First things first, I am not sure if this is the right place to post this, but since it seems people here tend to give good sounding advice.

I have 0 experience dating and this is causing me to feel very insecure sometimes when I stop and think about how much sex every other guy has had by my age(I'm 24). I can't stand hearing other's talk about their sexual experiences because I know that I would not be able to give women the same level of pleasure that they say they are getting or that their lovers say that they give them. After the last time I had a date(which was over a year ago), I got stood up for doing something that I said that was kinda fucked up(which I admit, was fucked up, but I was afraid of being taken advantage of at the time), and im afraid of the same thing happening again! Even though I learned from that, I can't imagine how many other mistakes I will probably commit that will piss women off.

This is the second time this weekend that I have gotten into this mindset. What im worried about is what women will think about my inexperience(which is partly not voluntary) and how they will react when I tell them the truth about why I am inexperienced. I just can't find a way of comfortably telling them how timid or over-religious I used to be or how I never had female friends or how I used to be addicted to video games. I am not comfortable with my own past that has lead me to be where I am in my (lack of) love life and simply can't afford to get help at the moment.

I get the feeling that she likes me because she says so as well. But a few days ago i saw that she updated her dating profile picture and some description.  
She still texts me quite a bit and seem just as interested.

Ofcourse i cant be mad because we are not exclusive. But this made me freak out because because i REALLY like this girl and for some reason didnt think she was looking to meeting others right now. She  
could just be updating and looking of dating apps when bored tho.

We are gonna meet in 2 days at her place and ill sleep over. I was thinking if i should bring the subject up. Tell her im not seing anyone else and just want to know where she is and what she is looking for in all of this.

Last week my grandpa had just passed and I was so sleep deprived from work that I was exhausted. I saw him recently and was already in an emotional state— I asked him if he was seeing other people still and he said yes. I had a complete breakdown and sobbed in front of him.

We talked about it and he said it was probably best to end things and I agreed. The next day I changed my mind and said I still wanted to be fwbs and he could see other people and I could see other people. I THOUGHT I had feelings for him, but it was really this fantasy I made of him in my mind. I put him on this pedestal. I want to go back to being casual / fwbs but he thinks that I do have feelings and I’m in denial. He is sure he doesn’t want to see me anymore.

Not only am I losing a friend, but I’m also losing great sex lol. I know that what we had was really short but we spent nearly every weekend together and yeah maybe I got attached. I think the uncertainty and the “chase” was addictive. Well now that uncertainty is gone and I truly am fine with him seeing others. It’s hard to find a fwb you genuinely get along with and trust 100%. I don’t want to lose him. I wish I hadn’t asked him if he was seeing others while I was already in that emotional state. I’m dealing with a lot of regret right now.

It’s weighing on my mind so much and I just want him to change his mind. I’ve been back on hinge and I feel like everyone (even the objectively attractive people) are just not as attractive as him.
