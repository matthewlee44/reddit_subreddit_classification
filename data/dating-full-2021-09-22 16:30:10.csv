He said he realized that wasn’t his thing and not something he was interested in. I was upset that he’d lied and said he just saw a part of it. I’m dramatic, so I cried and in the moment told him “I’m done”. He immediately was frazzled thinking I was gonna leave him and he called my mom and had a longggggg talk with her (I didn’t know).

We were having a great time, I cooked him lunch, etc and then I see that he gets on his phone and there is a red light coming from his screen illuminating his face and then it turns to a white light. 

I’m not an idiot. I know what tinder looks like. 

It made me upset. We are not officially together, but we have an agreement that we’re not going to be seeing other people. We’ve been consistently hanging out multiple times a week for the last month and I thought it was going really well. 

To be on tinder when I’m at his house feels incredibly disrespectful! He could tell that my mood changed and asked about it so I asked him if he was on tinder. He claimed to be looking at stories on Instagram. I do not believe this at all. I went on Instagram to see what kind of colors are associated with it and the opening screen of Instagram is black and so is the background of Instagram. He says he was looking at a story that must have been red. He seemed to stumble when giving me this explanation which just makes me feel even more certain that he was lying. 

If you want to keep a dating profile on your phone just in case things don’t work out, whatever. But if you’re actively using it and messaging people especially right in front of me, I’m not sure I can think of a more disrespectful thing that’s been done to me to my face. I really really like this guy, but now I don’t think he respects me. I’d love to give him the benefit of the doubt, but I want to trust my intuition too.

She's one of the first few good friends I've made since Going back to college. I wanted to tell her today that I liked her the moment we met up, but instead I ended up telling her after we hung out for most of the day.

Now there's a few signs that were obviously clear that she wasn't interested and saw me as a friend. Firstly, she's chinese and I'm american. I have had other friends who were also from China and mostly their only into other Chinese. Not always, but mostly. Other than loving american music and culture, she didn't seem to be one of the exceptions. Secondly she has male roommates who she talks about frequently, so I know her just hanging out with me wasn't anything special. Thirdly is that I met one of her roommates. And let me tell you, this guy is a Chinese STUD! Hell, that dude was enough to stir whatever gay in my body to arise. Knowing that I'm going again this, I know some random white dude she barely knows wouldn't have much of a chance.

However, I still feel I needed to tell her. Of couse I was hoping that she would say she has mutual feelings, but that wasn't all. I was feeling like a creep. Here's this girl who's been in america for only a month and still learning the ropes. and here's this guy who's being nice to her, teaching her little nuances of the US, but is hoping to get a little more out of it. That sounds like a form of predator I don't know the precise term of. So for that I decided I just gotta tell her

I basically just told her that I have a crush on her, and if I was acting weird today it was because of that. I think she was surprised, but she seemed okay with it. But she said unfortunately she doesn't feel that way, and I said I figured. I also told her I didn't want her to think I have alternative motives for hanging out, and I just wanted to be fully honest. She was very understanding from the looks of it. She said genuinely that she was sorry she didn't feel the same way. I told her there was no need. Something that did kinda confuse me was she asked if there was anything I was expecting or wanting from her. I said not at all and that was it. So after all that we said our goodbyes and left for the day.

Despite my previous reasoning, I still feel like an 1asshole for doing it. She was having problems making friends to begin with, so she enjoyed my friendship. Now this is out of the bag and maybe it's Making her questioning our time together. Of course I want to keep being friends with her. She's one of the most interesting people I've ever met. But now I feel maybe I've soiled the friendship cause I couldn't keep that passion to myself.

For more context, he and I are both in our early twenties, and we work in the food industry. He and I have a lot in common, such as living in the same town, aspiring to have the same professions, etc. He's a pretty friendly guy, but also kind of nerdy.

There was a time when work was really slow, and he and I were the only employees at the time, and we were talking for about an hour straight. We were talking about the high schools that we went to, and he asked me what I like to do for fun. I gave him a couple of my hobbies, and he would say things like ""I like doing that too!"" or ""I need to do that more!"" That same day, he also told me about really personal information about him getting bullied when he was younger. I'm happy he feels comfortable around me to share that info with me.

Before, I would usually be the one coming up to him and asking him questions. They would be simple questions such as his weekend plans. However, I stopped because I didn't want to be the one always initiating the conversation, and I felt as if I were asking him too many questions. Since I haven't been initiating the conversation, he's been the one approaching me and asking me questions about my weekend plans. While he does talk to other female coworkers, I'm the one he speaks to the most.

Whenever I need help with something, he's always the first person to help, even if it doesn't benefit him. For example, one time, he was restocking items, and I was helping a customer at the register. I made a mistake and forgot to give the customer change, and I was unable to open the register. I went to another employee that was slightly more experienced, but as I was asking the other employee, he came up to me and asked me what happened, and he wasn't able to help me with the register, but he tried regardless. And since he was doing something else at the time, it's not even as if it were convenient for him to help, yet, he did.

Another thing I forgot to mention is that there is a day where it is really slow, so there's only two or three workers for the entire day. I start early in the morning, and his shift always starts closer to noon. However, he comes in about 30 minutes to an hour after I come in and will be on his computer.

With dating, it seems quite simple. I think you simply tell the other person ""I just want to be friends"" (obviously more tactfully than that). But my dilemma is how to handle this situation with females I meet through other social channels. It's too presumptuous to explicitly say anything if the topic hasn't come up and she hasn't expressed clear interest but I feel very guilty because I feel like I am leading women on, which I do not want to do. Women (IMHO) are much more socially aware than men and they nearly always wait for the guy to make the move. But....I feel terrible because I can often tell a girl is interested in me but I feel like I am leading her on because I never make a move.

Do I keep dragging it on and then she will eventually get the hint, or do I drop a couple of trite lines ('I think we would make good friends')?

I’ve been single for four years, after a bitter divorce from a sociopath that was so horrific that the only thing that was missing was a murder-for-hire plot. And I wouldn’t discount that just yet either, hah.

Since then I’ve done the online dating thing. Finding a date isn’t hard. I’ve been on probably 80-100 dates with men - all different ages, backgrounds, personalities, but I feel absolutely nothing. NOTHING! The strongest feeling I’ve felt is, “They are objectively attractive on the outside”.

I experienced a sexual assault from one guy, which only further my inability to develop romantic feelings for someone. A lot of men develop strong feelings for me pretty quickly and I end up having to have awkward rejection conversations where sometimes (about 50% of the time) they end up blowing up at me and calling me names, which then again furthers my apathy towards men.

Now, I’ve done a lot of healing from my marriage, therapy, self-love, all that good stuff. I’m happy, healthy and thriving in every area of my life, I just cannot for the life of me find myself sexually or romantically attracted to anyone. Which sucks because I do deeply desire a relationship. 

My ex-husband recently entered into a new relationship (as told to me by my children), and I feel absolutely nothing about that other than confusion about how someone as awful as him could find love but here I am … alone.

To tell you the truth, people who are just looking for sex are bawdy, indecent, pornographic, underprivileged flunkees who do not have any respect for the opposite sex. Also, they can never be trusted! Our society needs to stop treating people as sex objects and start treating them as REAL HUMANS WHO HAVE FEELINGS!

I am very outgoing, adventurous, and loving. I like to go out to eat, go to movies, go camping, traveling, go to the beach, shop, and just being out in nature. I do try to workout a couple of times a week, if not more. It depends on how by body is feeling that day! I want someone funny, smart, adventurous, loving, and caring, like I am. I do not smoke. I do not do drugs. I do seldomly drink(a glass of wine at Thanksgiving and Christmas)! I have tried my best by searching for love on dating sites, but I have gotten scammed terribly on those! I am also willing to do whatever my mate wants to do. I guess that's categorized as adventurous, though, huh?

No that was absolutely impossible, the islanders would see my car. And that she was having a ""man"" visit. This was the first red flag. But it kinda intrigued me as well, it made me feel like she was sincerely interested in finding a man.

So she says we can meet at the summer festival, at the folk music festival. That's not my cup of tea I say, I won't know anyone there. 

She assured me that she was the only company I needed. 

Fine, ill meet you at the festival I said. She giggled 'we have our date'

The entrance fee was 150$ bucks, a bit steep imo. Expensive if you're not interested in the bands. 

I hang out at the entrance, waiting for my date. And here she comes, a tall man is holding around her. And she is learning into his grip. Her freind is also holding another mans hand. 

I only know her freind from talking with her, but I immediately ask her who these blokes where. 'Oh! They had their tents next to ours m8! We where really lucky!'

She is drunk allready, and I haven't touched a drop. They're all fired up. So I go to a stand selling beer, I down one then a second. And the third beer ill hold in my hand. So lets paaaaarty! 

As a footballer waiting for his match. I never got to touch the ball, I never even entered the stadium. I never got to talk with her alone, and her new man gave me the stink eye.

Well, I was in a relationship from October 2020 to the beginning of this September. I met my ex on Tinder and he was the 15th guy I had a date with - and I think that’s the crux of the matter why I don’t really want to go on dates anymore. 

I was so exhausted from constantly chatting with people, telling the same things over and over again, going on dates, being disappointed again and again or having to reject men. It feels like a never-ending marathon, doesn’t it?
I would like to be in a relationship, I would like to find „the one“ but the road you have to take in order to find them is so damn rocky. 
I met 14 other guys before I met my then boyfriend. If I think about meeting 14 men or more in order to find my next partner… oh, I’d rather stay single. 
One of my friends told me at the beginning of my dating adventure: „I had to meet 33 guys until I found my perfect partner.“ That’s nothing I’m looking forward to doing, to be honest.

We have been together for 8 months and he has a newborn daughter. His child’s mother has an extreme amount of animosity towards me I believe because we got together while she was pregnant. I had no idea before entering this relationship that he had a baby on the way, and when she approached me about the situation, he told me that he was unsure about paternity himself. She is extremely disrespectful towards our relationship by calling him at all hours of the night and making unrealistic requests. When I approach him about my concerns he always says that his priority is the well being of the child but I feel like because of past situations the child’s mother should be dealt with on a more assertive approach. To me, it’s disrespectful that she has ignored the fact that he has moved on into a new relationship and that their relationship is strictly co-parenting as opposed to romantically involved while raising their child. I also feel like he should see that her behaviour has caused a rift in our relationship and is it his responsibility as he is only one who can encourage and enforce boundaries and respect to settle differences. His approach at the moment is to appease her in order to avoid going to family court. I have spoken to my boyfriend numerous times expressing how I feel disrespected and he does not seem to make any type of effort to help resolve the situation between us. This has brought distrust into our relationship and frankly I feel that I don’t even recognize the man I entered this relationship with.

We then went our separate ways and met up last year for the first time in 5 years. He was came to visit his friend from my state and wanted to meet up with me. I didn’t expect it to be a date but he kissed me and bought me dinner. It was a great date and he wasn’t expecting anything after the date if you know what I mean. He even joked saying he wanted to marry me. The conversation flowed and we were both flirtatious. We then went on another date and he picked me up and we went for a walk. We then were dancing and opening up to each other. He then goes back to his state and a week later or so tells me that he got a job opportunity in another state that was even further. I initially thought there is no way this is going to work but he was very very persistent on wanting me to go visit him. Even though I really wanted to, I was scared of Covid (this is when it first started) and I never flown on a plane alone before. He was understanding that I wanted to wait and said that he would make me feel comfortable once I was there. But after a while, I continued to say no because I was terrified. Not only because of Covid but because our two best friends (Mike and Alana) aren’t dating anymore. I brought up to my friend that Eric reached out to me and she freaked! Saying that I shouldn’t date her ex boyfriends best friend. She also does not like him because he hooked up with Alanas friend many years ago, who at the time, was dating Eric’s friend. Eric felt really bad for what he did and acknowledged what he did was wrong. So now, Alana, alanas friend, and that boyfriend, does not like him. This puts me in an uncomfortable situation. Eric and I are in our mid to late twenties and this situation happened when I was 18. Do I think what he did was wrong, of course. Even after it happened, Alana encouraged me to hook up Eric. 

Someone in his family passed away and he came back up to my state for the services. He invited me to go but again, covid. He invited me to see his friends and family.

Anyways, Eric and I went our separate ways again and he got a girlfriend. They broke up a couple months ago and he reached out to me a few weeks ago. Since then we have been talking. He said he going to visit my state and wants to see me. He wishes me good morning sometimes and invited me to go to an event in his state. He even joked about saying he wanted to marry me again lol.

For more context, he and I are both in our early twenties, and we work in the food industry. He and I have a lot in common, such as living in the same town, aspiring to have the same professions, etc. We also go to the same university. He's a pretty friendly guy, but also kind of nerdy.

There was a time when work was really slow, and he and I were the only employees at the time, and we were talking for about an hour straight. We were talking about the high schools that we went to, and he asked me what I like to do for fun. I gave him a couple of my hobbies, and he would say things like ""I like doing that too!"" or ""I need to do that more!"" That same day, he also told me about really personal information about him getting bullied when he was younger. I'm happy he feels comfortable around me to share that info with me.

Before, I would usually be the one coming up to him and asking him questions. They would be simple questions such as his weekend plans. However, I stopped because I didn't want to be the one always initiating the conversation, and I felt as if I were asking him too many questions. I also am introverted and sometimes have difficulty starting a conversation with people. Since I haven't been starting the conversation, he's been the one approaching me and asking me questions about my weekend plans. While he does talk to other female coworkers, I'm the one he speaks to the most. And whenever I come in, he'll always make an effort to walk over to me and ask me about how my day/or weekend went. From what I've seen, he doesn't do that to other people.

Whenever I need help with something, he's always the first person to help, even if it doesn't benefit him. For example, one time, he was restocking items, and I was helping a customer at the register. I made a mistake and forgot to give the customer change, and I was unable to reopen the register. I went to another employee that was slightly more experienced, but as I was asking the other employee, he came up to me and asked me what happened. I explained to him, and he tried to help me out. He wasn't able to help me with the register, but he tried regardless. And since he was doing something else at the time, it's not even as if it were convenient for him to help, yet, he did, and I didn't ask him to. But I'm grateful he did.

Another thing I forgot to mention is that there is a day where it is really slow, so there's only two or three workers for the entire day. I start early in the morning, and his shift always starts closer to noon. However, he comes in about 30 minutes to an hour after I come in and will be on his computer.

I'll be out, having fun (usually on the dance floor) probably not even looking for any prospects, and women will approach me.

Sometimes this is after we've shared a couple of 'looks' across the room, but mostly they're completely cold approaches and they have just materialized in front of me and started talking to me, feeling my arms etc. Some have also given me their phone number.

So far, life sounds good, right?

But it feels like, more often than not, within 2 minutes some guy will show up saying he's her boyfriend.

Now typically I'm just in and out, quickly grabbing a few slices and off back to work to eat in the break room. I've now had around 6 interactions with this girl, and it's very hard for me to tell if she has any interest in me, it if she's just doing her job. 

Typically she will add to the conversations, even starting some of them. We've talked about the plastic bag ban in New York, the pandemic, how long she's worked there, I've picked on her for not being able to get the TV's to display properly. Talked about food we disliked and so on. She's always smiling when talking to me, makes alot of eye contact and giggles at my shitty jokes.

I've asked several friends on their opinions and none of them can seem to agree. One saying don't bother she's just doing her job, one saying let her make the first move and another stating I should just ask. Am I reading to far into this? Should I let her make the first move? Should I maybe offer her up my number if she ever wants to talk about more than work related things?

I have a son who is four weeks old. I am completely dependent on my boyfriend in his country. 

Last night he returned home and I felt a vibrate in his bag. It was discovered that he had been talking to girls using this extra phone for the entirety of the relationship, he actually has owned this phone for years apparently. He claims to have had this phone for back up if we ever broke up, because he had lots of girls there. He recently started talking to girls, one girl more specifically. He plan to meet up with her last night and have sex, ultimately he did it because apparently he thought of me and his son.

I am not taking blame for what he did, but I can understand why he did it. We have not had sex for two months, I am highly depressed here in his country and I can see that I project this depression and him. I cook and clean, but I never smile or laugh. Many times he would send me a text message with many heart I emoji‘s, for example, and I would just respond with only one word. I’ve been this way since about 30 weeks pregnant, extremely emotional. I would like to have been a better partner but I wasn’t and this is where it got us. 

I feel absolutely disgusted with what he did, I feel even more depressed than before knowing that he was going to go be with some other woman. I feel like my body is damaged goods, as he is in tiptop physical shape and I am not anymore. I can’t help it take part of the blame, but in the end I don’t know if I can ever forget this and move on.

Lastly, I told him I would like to go home with my son and he told me I’m not leaving this country with my son. He said I better get a court date because it’s not happening. He said I can leave alone but my son is staying here. Obviously I won’t leave my four week old who is breastfeed. He hasn’t kicked me out or threatened to, but I’m definitely in a vulnerable situation here. My heart is broken.

We were both 18 when we started dating eachother. She is my first girlfriend and my first everything. She was actually the first girl i kissed and had sex with. At the beginning like first 2 months of our relationship we didnt't have sex at all. Slowly we started having sex sometimes. I think sex is one of the biggest problems of ours.

Our lack of sex in our relationship really bothers me. I have so high sex drive that i could literally have sex with her everyday or even multiple times a day. I could please her for hours. It really eats me inside because i cant have sex with her often. She only want's to have sex like 2 times a month. Usually when i try to make a move in bed she says that she is tired and doesnt want to have sex. It bothers me that i allways have to make the first move and usually i just get rejected by her. But some
nights her goodnight kisses end up to us having sex so i guess thats her way to make move but why she does that so rarely? 
I would never force her to have sex with me i allways make sure that she actually wants to have sex, but it's sad that it's only like 2 times a month and i want more. How can i get her to have sex with me more without forcing or pressuring her anyway?

I talked about her about this and she said that she has a low libido. We also talked about masturbating and i found out that she has masturbated only once and found it very boring and didn't even like it.
I also know that she has never had a orgasm. 

Months ago when i found out about her orgasm problem and i started to work on the problem. I watched hours and hours of tutorials on how to please a woman. They helped and my girlfriend liked the techniques but they were not enough to make her orgasm.

Next time i asked her to give me exact instrutions on what she likes and don't like. Well, she told me that she doesnt know what she liked and doesnt know any instructions to give me. 

I told her that its ok to not to know and i asked her if she wanted to find out what she likes and what she doesnt like. 

It went well but she wanted to stop because it started to feel uncomfortable when the clit became very sensitive and her vagina expanded. This happens EVERYTIME when whe have had sex. She cannot take it no more and wants to allways stop at that point. She is allways the one who wants to stop our sex. I could have sex with her hours and finger her and lick her for hours but she can't take it. It's ok to me but why she doesnt want continue so she can orgasm?


There is also some problems in our daily life.

She doesn't like to sleep at my place or hangout as much that i would like. 
I have nice big top floor apartment in the city and her work place is 3 minute drive from my place. Also our school that we both go is like 5 minute walk. I just dont understand why she doesnt want to stay here longer that one night and couple evenings in a week. All my friends girlfriends beg to spend time with them. sometimes i feel like I have to beg my girlfriend to spend time with me. 

She allways tells me that she has schoolwork to do and she does, but why doesn't want to do schoolwork at my place. Why she wants to sit in her room everyday. It also doesn't make sense why she prefers to go home late in the evenings and in the morning drive 20 minutes to work or school when she could spend the night and sleep later at my place.

It really makes me feel so lonely when she doesnt want to sleep with me or spend that much time with me. I sometimes feel like im giving more than im recieving in this relationship.

Sometimed i just feel like im not enough and i have felt really depressed. I just feel like she doesnt want me as much as i do her. Im living on my own and it gets so lonely. I just wish i could have someone with me.

My selfesteem is very low because of this and i hate my self a little. Im a bodybuilder and i have good size down there but i still feel like a piece of shit.

This just makes me very anxious and sad. I really love and care about this girl.

Anyways we meet through college around that time i was 19 when we met ( about to turn 20 ) and he was 20 at the time when we first met we both shared the same birthday month etc and I didn't like him at first when we met I just thought ""cool I met a new guy friend"") this guy was basically everything I wanted in a man after these feelings started to show up. ( read the next paragraph)  

But overtime I got to get to know him and my heart starting to fall for him hard i would always find myself nervous to speak to him and constantly wanting to sit by him, get him things like food and a drink if he wanted it. Anyways eventually time came and one day I decided to tell him how I felt I sat down with him outside while I waited for my ride to show up and told him how i felt, and we went on a date after that. 

Forgot to mention one night I got my book bag stolen he wondered where I was and saw I was crying and hugged me through the night and even walked me to my ride he always did that. 

Basically we went on the date had a fun time and afterwards he told me that he just wanted to be friends with me ( not gonna lie i was heartbroken because it takes me a very very long time to fall for anyone like it could take me 3 years or 4 years to fall for somebody and usually it comes out of no where ) 

After awhile we took a break from each other because he said our friendship was too complicated and things like that a couple of months go by me and him are talking constantly getting to know each other more and grow our friendship ( I still love this man by the way). He ended up getting me a rosary for valentines day and got it blessed by his priest at church and then about a month ago he asked me if I wanted to hang out soon. ( this point I'm like okay things are turning around ) but when I ask him when he was going to make plans to see me ( he recently started working) he says that it's because of work and other things.

He never really tells me what the other things are ( which it doesn't bother me ) but my friends have told me that if he really misses me he would make time to see me no matter what circumstances. ) Right now I don't drive ( I have a car but no license yet im working in that once I get my job soon which is taking a long time and I gotta pay for driving courses ) I can't go over his house because I don't want to show up unannounced or anything like that.

So far I've just been waiting for him to make a day or anything like that but one time he told me that he drove up to another city which was an hour awayfor a day and im just like really dude you got all that time to do that but no time to see me? 

Its just frustrating because I have no control over my love life If i did I would be in a 5 year relationship by now, and I did send him a long paragraph explaining how I felt about the situation basically pouring my heart out and all he said was thanks for your concern and sorry I haven't seen you in 2 years. After he said that I broke down crying.  Right now I'm taking a break form it all because it's starting to affect my mental health... I don't know what his going through but I do hope his okay. ( by the way I don't have the rosary he got me yet and I don't want to feel like I'm pushing him away by asking him when Is he going to make plans.. ) 

I decided I'm not gonna ask him anymore about it and just take a break anyways any thoughts on this or advice would be welcomed.

Forgot to mention he is religious ( I am also not a dealbreaker ) he wants to remain celibate till marriage and I want to wait till marriage to have sex anyway ( just thought I'd mention this ) he does text me whenever he has time but I've also heard that some people are really bad at making plans.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1021355,public,self,Is he breadcrumbing or am I overreacting?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pthy79/is_he_breadcrumbing_or_am_i_overreacting/,all_ads,6,,,,49223cde-abc9-11e9-b518-0ee41f1cd37e,dark,,

She changed the relationship status on Facebook a couple weeks back and is happy to tell people that we are a couple, holding hands in public etc. We’ve had sex several times, and we get along great both in and out of the bedroom.

She’s more than happy to kiss, but cannot make out. I’ve tried initiating it a couple of times but it’s just not happening. I’ve asked her about this and she just says it makes her laugh too much (she used to giggle when kissing but has calmed down a bit now). She also giggles constantly during sex although she’s assured me that she’s not laughing at me, that’s just what she does.
I will say that she’s never had a boyfriend before so everything is very new to her (and me really). 

She’s told me that shes falling for me, and we are super happy when we’re together.

She has done absolutely nothing to break my trust or to even make me feel sketched out, I’d say the opposite, out of anyone I have dated she has been the easiest to trust and make me feel comfortable.

Now here comes my issue, I have issues trusting people, I find it very hard to believe that someone actually wants to be there for me, and is not lying to me/ seeing other men behind my back. I have been in therapy for a good 12 years working on problems like this, but this issue is always one that has stuck. I know why I have this issue too, it stems from some severe bullying that I went through from the age of 4 – 15. Where I had “friends” and teachers tell me I could trust them but in reality, they did some awful things to me. Being cheated on and having dealt with some serious lying in my romantic past has not helped either.

This extends into relationships I have now where I have a hard time believing that people are not out to get me or hurt me or are not lying to me. I hate feeling this way, I want to change but I don’t know how. A lot of advice I get is “just decide to trust them” but I feel like that is little help when I’m in my head spiraling out of control.

I really like this girl and would like to solve these issues so they don’t cause strain on the relationship. If anyone used to be the way I was and now was able to change, how did you do it? It seems impossible.

I started dating a guy that I liked a couple weeks ago and it seemed like a pretty healthy relationship. We were communicating our needs, going on actual dates, texting everyday, calling, all of it, it was great. 

But then he told me a couple days ago that he's thinking of taking a job in another state. He told me that he wasn't mature enough for long distance and I don't want to do a long distance relationship either. So we decided to call it quits. 

We talked for a couple days after but the dynamic (albeit pretty short to develop one) was off. He replied but was short with me and the conversation would drift.

The thing is, I've never really had any experiences in the dating world and I have pretty strong social anxiety. I'm gonna explain the story I currently have with the girl in question and for the purpose of this post let's call her Emily.

So our story (which isn't quite very exciting, I'm afraid) started about 3 weeks ago. I saw her in one of my classes in school and since then, I don't seem to be able to get her out of my head. A few classes ago I started sitting as close as possible from her so we could maybe start chatting a bit. So there's basically Emily on the edge of our table, her friend is beside her and then there's me. I tried to talk to them at first, but couldn't because of my anxiety. But about 2 classes ago, they invited me to work with them on a little paper for the class. I gladly accepted their offer and we chatted a bit, but nothing more because I was pretty stressed out and couldn't think straight about things to talk about. Then, last class (which was monday), I asked them if I could join them again since I forgot a book that we needed for the work that we needed to do that class. They obviously accepted and we started working a little bit like before. But this class, I managed to talk more to them and it was way less ""awkward"" and tense (it's a bit more complicated to talk to Emily though... she seems more reserved than her friend). 

Also, I find myself working a lot at the library during the week and it turns out that Emily and I are a lot there at the same time. Sometimes she works alone and sometimes she's got a friend(s) with her. Now, here comes my question:

What should I do knowing all that information? She doesn't seem interested in me, to be honest (well, I've never caught her looking at me or anything at the library or in class and she's pretty reserved when we talk so...) Should I go talk to her at the library and ask her if she wants to study with me? Should I text her and start chatting more with her (yes, that is also an option)? Should I wait to talk more with her in class before I try anything? Should I just do nothing and let things go? I'm a bit lost, obviously, and I don't want to mess up and rush things or come off as a creep.

Anyway, I hope you can realize that this is a pretty big step for me and, hopefully, you can give me some advices on how to move on with Emily.

I seemingly wind up in situationships and get stuck. I decided to follow a few dating and relationship coaches on Instagram to educate myself more on the dating game. 

What I’m seeing a lot is the idea that you will not get a relationship if you do not incentivize it. Meaning, if you’re in the “talking” stage, (not official yet) and you’re doing all of the things “official” committed couples do, the man has no reason to change the status of the relationship. He’s already getting everything he wants. Obviously the main component here is sex. But this can also include cooking for someone, doing romantic things, the “girlfriend treatment.” 

I see a lot of these coaches recommend incentivizing the relationship by holding off on having sex (among other things) until you’re at least exclusive. 

I’ve truly never done this. 
1) I have a high sex drive and typically if I’m into someone, I’m not talking to or sleeping with anyone else.
2) I’m learning that sometimes I use sex to move into intimacy prematurely. 

I guess I find it hard to believe a guy would stick around for months and be patient while not having sex until the relationship reaches the point of exclusivity talks. 

Has anyone ever done this? I’d like to try it once I’m ready to date again.

**For context** : So I started texting this girl 3 weeks ago, because of a mutual friend. At first they wanted to invite her to a party we were doing in a condo (I don't know if it's a real word in english but it's like a second house for rich people) so I could meet her, but she already had something. I decided to start texting her and she showed what I think is interest because we texted nearly every night and had good talk. Sometime she texted first other time it was me after the second day of texting I ask if she wanted to go out for lunch since she had a long 6 hours with no classes and she doesn't own a car so she stayed at the college for the entire day and she accepted to go out. We had to move the date to another moment because of a school project she had but she instantly suggested a day the next week. We texted every night till the day of the date arrived and we went eating together and it was fun. She texted me back that night saying that she liked the date and I suggested going again sometime and she agreed.

**More context** : The next day I was working and she texted to know when my shift ended and if I wanted to go hang out with her and one of her friend that were at a party they didn't like. I accepted and joined them after my work and we had fun talking and she said that she could come the the party she wasn't available for before. I thought that she changed her mind because I was going.

**The party** : The next day was the party in the condo that I talked at the  beginning, it was 1hour and 30minutes away from us our town, so we went with to separate vehicle. Me and one of my buddy were in the truck and in the other car was my buddy's GF and another friend of mine that didn't come with is GF and another couple that are also my friends (the girl in the couple was the one who presented me to this girl).

**The Party (Night)** : During the party my friends leaved me and the girl alone on purpose so we could talk. IMPORTANT THING, there was alcohol involve but the girl I was with wasn't drunk maybe just a bit tipsy. Personally I drank more but I was still very much conscious and remember everything. So there was two floor and a basement the house was really compact and built in height. We were on the top floor after playing truth or dare and me and this girl decided to make a pillow fort, after we stayed in it a bit and the other joined us we decide to go to sleep so we made a bit of a tent with a bunk bed and decided to both sleep on the bottom bed. After a bit in bed she ask for my hand and wrapped it around her (basically spooning) and after like 30 minutes she ask if she could kiss me, so we kissed for like a minute and we fell asleep hugging each other.

**The next day** : In the morning she ask if we should get out of bed and we did but for the rest of the day we only really talked once. We leaved the condo in the car I asked her if she wanted to go eat again this week and she said yes, but we didn't really talk after that. During the rest of the day (and maybe a few days after but decreasingly) I had this feeling of sadness/happiness/emptiness it was so weird like I already missed that night. In the evening I texted her saying that I liked the time we spent together and she said she did too.

**The part that confuse me** : After saying she liked it too, she said that she wanted to go slower (*She acknowledge the fact that it may sound weird since she was the one making moves*) and she didn't want to rush things. I said it was alright with me and we continue texting until she went to sleep a few message after. We texted the next day, but it felt like the conversation was shorter and not as ''fun'' as usual. So the next day when we texted again I ask if she could clarify and she did. She said pretty much the same thing but more cleary and she added that she didn't want to *hurt me by giving me fake hope* so that's why she wanted to take it slower. That's the part that ''scared'' me. She said that she still really wanted to go out for lunch as we planned in the car. We arrive to last night where we texted and this time it felt like it was before we had a really good time chatting and she didn't want to go to sleep because she liked the conversation, but I told her that I didn't want her to be tired tommorow so we both went to sleep.  


**Now** : Tomorrow we have our second date (it will be the 4th time we see each other) and I'm really not sure if there's a chance it might work or she just want to be friend  


I'm really confused. 

\-The fact that she made moves but want to take things slower really confused me.        

  
\-I totally understand that she wants to know me more before getting in a relationship (I do too)

  
\-The way she says she doesn't want to hurt my feelings is the most ''scaring'' thing to me. Like does she already know it will not work ?

Me, Male (33). Maybe it's been this way for a while, but I've spent the last 7 years between 3 relationships, and a year ago came out of an engagement. After taking the last year to make sure I'm ok enough to try dating again, I've found what is essentially a cesspool within the online dating world. Now, usually I would like to go out but covid has made that very difficult, and I have used Tinder before and actually met some cool people on there. Ultimately, not ones I was more than friends with after we talked, but there were actually ""people"" on there. 

I've tried a variety of apps and sites and it's basically the same kind of thing. I've matched with people promoting their OF account and getting mad because I wanted to meet up for some fun. A very large number of prostitutes, and girls who are actually asking me to pay them to talk with them. I'm puzzled here because I went to school for 4 years so far to be a psychologist, and a girl who can barely put together a sentence wants me to pay her to talk? xD The irony. Then there's those who can hold a conversation to save their life and seem to want me to carry the whole interaction. 

Example: 

Her: Hi

Me: Hey. How are you?

Her: I'm ok you?

Before I continue..... wtf? See, when wanting to have a conversation you need to put some kind of emphasis on what you type. If I ask how are you, jazz it up. Tell me something that hooks my attention like; ""I'm well, but work was a killer."" or ""I'm good. I'm listening to some sick tunes, do you like..."" 

This is just mind-blowing because girls in their profile will expect guys to dazzle them with pick-up lines, and be super interesting to a fault for a girl with 2 kids, tipping 40, and saying they don't want to have fun unless we are immediately serious...... 

There was another Tinder girl recently who told me she is new to my area and is really in the mood. She said she wanted a dick in her mouth, and I said I am always safe, and any sex that excludes condoms we'd need to get checked. She didn't respond much after this and I said I'd be a friend if she wanted to get to know the area, and I asked her interests. Unmatched. xD

I think it's sad that I've especially met so many prostitutes. One specifically even tried degrading me for being a man and expecting sex without paying for it. ""There's men everywhere."" Like, wtf? 

Just a bit of a rant. I wasn't expecting such a hostile environment upon being single again.

For more context, he and I are both in our early twenties, and we work in the food industry. He and I have a lot in common, such as living in the same town, aspiring to have the same professions, etc. We also go to the same university. He's a pretty friendly guy, but also kind of nerdy.

There was a time when work was really slow, and he and I were the only employees at the time, and we were talking for about an hour straight. We were talking about the high schools that we went to, and he asked me what I like to do for fun. I gave him a couple of my hobbies, and he would say things like ""I like doing that too!"" or ""I need to do that more!"" That same day, he also told me about really personal information about him getting bullied when he was younger. I'm happy he feels comfortable around me to share that info with me.

Before, I would usually be the one coming up to him and asking him questions. They would be simple questions such as his weekend plans. However, I stopped because I didn't want to be the one always initiating the conversation, and I felt as if I were asking him too many questions. I also am introverted and sometimes have difficulty starting a conversation with people. Since I haven't been starting the conversation, he's been the one approaching me and asking me questions about my weekend plans. While he does talk to other female coworkers, I'm the one he speaks to the most. And whenever I come in, he'll always make an effort to walk over to me and ask me about how my day/or weekend went. From what I've seen, he doesn't do that to other people.

Whenever I need help with something, he's always the first person to help, even if it doesn't benefit him. For example, one time, he was restocking items, and I was helping a customer at the register. I made a mistake and forgot to give the customer change, and I was unable to reopen the register. I went to another employee that was slightly more experienced, but as I was asking the other employee, he came up to me and asked me what happened. I explained to him, and he tried to help me out. He wasn't able to help me with the register, but he tried regardless. And since he was doing something else at the time, it's not even as if it were convenient for him to help, yet, he did, and I didn't ask him to. But I'm grateful he did.

Another thing I forgot to mention is that there is a day where it is really slow, so there's only two or three workers for the entire day. I start early in the morning, and his shift always starts closer to noon. However, he comes in about 30 minutes to an hour after I come in and will be on his computer. I thought he was doing homework, but he watches YouTube videos. And I've noticed he chooses a table where we can see each other perfectly.
