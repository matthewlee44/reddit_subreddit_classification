I‚Äôm also actually really shy and quiet, but I‚Äôm tall, in shape and usually dress well and get a lot of attention (I think just because I stand out a bit). His friends were also always trying to hit on me and he always seemed really shy and nervous around me. Anyway, he recently moved away - just before I was about to finally ask him out - so two weeks ago, I texted him asking if he‚Äôd like to grab coffee sometime. I figured he‚Äôs shy, maybe intimidated, I have to make the first move and voila we will finally go out. To my horror, he never replied.

I recently found out from a mutual friend that he actually just lost his job and had to move in with family. That‚Äôs why he left suddenly. 

I feel so badly for him, especially because if he did like me (which I was pretty sure he did), I probably just made him feel even worse. I‚Äôm trying to move on already. Obviously, he has more important things to worry about, but I haven‚Äôt been able to stop thinking about him still and holding onto this hope that eventually things will work out. I liked him so much. And if he actually wasn‚Äôt interested and I completely misread the signs - oh well. But I hate that he could actually like me and just feels too ashamed right now to even talk to me. And I‚Äôm afraid to bother him again - I don‚Äôt want to harass him if he‚Äôs not interested or just make things worse. 

To add to my nightmare, I was walking my dog today when I got to an intersection and noticed a vehicle that looked exactly like his. I thought I really need to stop thinking about this guy - of course, it can‚Äôt be him. The car waited there and let me walk past. Then I saw it pull over down the street and I realized it was him! He stopped by to grab old mail apparently (we were neighbors). I avoided bumping into him and just went inside like I didn‚Äôt notice. 

What are the chances that I just had to be there the moment he decided to stop by after almost 3 weeks? It just made it even more painful.

Would you consider this being lead on?

I‚Äôm not sure if I was lead on or I was reading the signals wrong from one of my collage mates 

1. One time a romantic song come up and she whispered in my ear that the song  has potential to  describe us in the future. 

2. One time she even come to me and was like I‚Äôm the only girl that can make you listen to juice wrld cuz what we have is special.  But I tried to use juice wrld to make a flirty joke the week before and she give a disgusted look. 

3. Then she even opened about her depression and suicidal thoughts to me and said I‚Äôm the only person she‚Äôs ever told 

4. Then when we were working on the second physics exam I must have been like this is so nostalgic cuz we meet on the first Phsycis exam deadline so I was like do you remember the date we meet on. I swear this had to be on purpose she was like I can‚Äôt remember because we have never been on a first date. I don‚Äôt think she could have misunderstood my question that badly. 

5.Even one time wen watching a movie as a group she was dangling her foot and then decided to lift her whole leg  up which blocked my whole screen of the movie and she was like I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm sorry.  I just felt like it was on purpose. 

I was getting ready to ask her out on a date but then I heard some bad news 

My friend  calls me and he was like he was talking to this girl the other day and on the phone she was like there‚Äôs this guy that I use to like but I don‚Äôt like him anymore if you can guess him I will tell you if it‚Äôs right and then my friend said my name and she was like straight away nooooooooo and put up some weird face expression and was like don‚Äôt get me wrong I don‚Äôt hate the guy but he‚Äôs so annoying at times and he‚Äôs such an overreactor I could never date him. 

There were definitely other factors that made me think I had to no chance 

but I just can‚Äôt understand why she was flirting and telling me her  deepest secret and  especially the song the way she whispered into my ears. 

At the end I really feel like she used me for validation and attention as she would come to every time she wanted to be uplifted and be like you don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm stupid etc. She also used me for exam help.

I have \*just\* started on the path to separation from my husband of 3 years. Sleeping in my own bedroom, looking at apartments, getting finances in order. We are in Canada so we need to be separated for a full year to divorce (generally). I initiated all this. It's tense at home. But I realized I am not in love anymore and haven't been for some time. Pre-pandemic things were not good. I want to give myself the chance to find a partner who I share the rest of my life with.  I am almost 33. 

All that being said, I know that I am emotionally vulnerable right now. I have also been out of the dating ""game\* since 2012. Am I completely fooling myself thinking I could or should be looking for anything serious any time soon? I will discuss this with my therapist at some point haha but looking for opinions/experiences here. When I fall for someone, I fall hard. I haven't felt emotionally unfulfilled in my relationship in SO long. I have a real need for emotional and physical intimacy. I was never much for casual dating. I'm not expecting the next guy I date to be someone I marry, but I also don't want to go into it with the expectation that it will for sure be casual. If the guy is only wanting something casual, I don't see the point?

Am I just being ridiculous? I have a lot to get sorted out. But I'm a caring person who has a lot of love and attention to give. And I'm not getting any younger....hahaha \*sobs\*

I really like to use those wand vibrators because they can stimulate areas that make me feel good.

Would this be a problem for you ladies if you found out a guy owned and enjoyed using one? Would you be ok if he used it during foreplay or even during sex? 

Before my current partner, my previous ones shamed me, told everyone at my school that own vibrators, that I‚Äôm gay and also a creep. It was so traumatic that I debated never telling anyone ever again‚Ä¶ fortunately after a few years with my partner I opened up to her about it and we like to use it together on me and on her and sometimes both at the same time!

What are the most popular/promising apps?

What are the most popular/promising areas to meet singles in Dallas?

Are most people ""relationship oriented"" or more casual fun - parties, fwb, going out etc.

What are some date ideas you have had and enjoyed?

So, since I'm excited to be moving and a bit bored at home I decided to throw out a bumble and a hinge profile to see if I could vibe with anyone ahead of time and hit the ground running. These profiles saw a mild amount of success a few months ago in NYC, and they are pretty thoroughly filled out cause i'm seeking a relationship more than something casual.

Unfortunately, I'd say I'm disappointed with the lack of results after a few days being up (in comparison with NYC). I'm not here to mope, but I think I will refactor my profile to highlight some different things about me, some things I noticed in Dallas :

1. A lot of women seem to want something more casual, or don't take bumble/hinge as seriously as women in NYC (either they specify they want something casual or have a low effort profile).
2. A large emphasis on sports, particularly football/baseball; and also on fitness
3. A small but fervent religious crowd.
4. Its important to note Dallas has a much smaller population than NYC so I expect proportionately less likes/matches. Sure, comes with the territory.

How is it possible for someone who identifies as non-binary to dismiss the notion of gender by...

Then simplifying gender as something so materialistic as how 'males' and 'females' dress?

Non-binary people would say they identify as both female and male because sometimes they like to wear makeup and 'girly' clothes and at other times they like to dress masculine and play sports. Isn't that completely undermining what gender is, and ironically acknowledging gender (""I like to dress masculine and feminine"") in order to choose to drift between both gender? 


Lots of non-binary people's reasoning seems to be that the like to drift between dressing like and male or female, so they're acknowledging 'gender' while also trying to dismiss it. It doesn't make sense?


They're basically saying that to be a women is to like wearing makeup and presenting themselves female and vice versa. Isn't that dangerous to simplify it like that after women by birth have faced centuries of oppression and it means much more to be a women than if they dress feminine or not?

Today I went to the gym and was working out in the section of the gym with 5 squat racks against one side of the room and the rest of the room is for people to freestyle their workouts with yoga pads and few dumbbells. This is what side of the room I was on. There was this girl that was working out at this squat rack at my 2 o'clock position. She was obviously squatting and her form caught my attention. I gave her couple glances she noticed me and I swear it seemed like she was going into performance mode and was doing very provocative stretches in between her sets. I tried not to look and be creepy. She was then texting with someone then she left the room. I didn't think anything of it and continued my regularly scheduled workout

But she returned with another friend few minutes later and she then proceeded to go to the squat rack that was at my 12 oc clock position right in front of me. The last one she was working out was still available.  I was doing sit ups, leg lifts etc where I spent most of the time on my back with clear view of the two girls in front of me. Again I didn't stare other than normal looking around the room and scanning by them. After few minutes, the original girl grabbed a set weight bar from a rack nearby walked over to sit in between the rack where her friend and her were squatting and where I was laying on the yoga mat.

We met online at the beginning of quarantine, so it took awhile to get together in person and never progressed into anything physical. It ended because, among a couple other things, I was on a downward spiral mentally and while he was eager to spend more time together, I was extremely nervous about it due to my job (I work in a heavily customer-focused setting and was constantly forced to be around people who were unmasked, so I was even isolating from family). The stress of wanting to meet with him and see where things went clashed with my sense of responsibility to do the safe, smart thing and not potentially expose him and, indirectly, the people he would've been in contact with, too. It got to a point where I couldn't handle the pressure of feeling like I was letting him down, so I let him go instead. 

I've thought about him a lot since. After getting the vaccine, I tried getting back onto apps to try that out, but my heart hasn't been in it. Maybe it's my lack of general experience in the area talking, but I'm convinced what we had might've been special. I'm also just as convinced I'm supposed to move on and learn from this experience. Appreciate it for what it was and let it go. I've been warned not to ""backtrack"" by multiple friends.

I guess my question is: when do you know it's worth reaching out and seeing how he might feel? (For the record, I don't expect that he's been pining for me by any means.)

TL;DR: My boyfriend has broken my trust on a few occasions and has done a couple of other things that I am worried are red flags. I can't get perspective as I really love him and I'm worried I'm overreacting/being unfair. I need some objective input - are these red flags or not, and what should I do? Not looking for judgment, just advice on what to do.

I've been dating my (27F) boyfriend (28M) for over 2 years. I have PTSD and MDD due to a traumatic incident. I told my boyfriend what had happened about 6 months into dating and he was around when I was diagnosed with PTSD and MDD after I was hospitalised for a suicide attempt. We've been having a lot of issues and I need advice.

First, he's been weird about it all. for example, when I spoke to him about it for the first time and he was online shopping on his laptop in bed, and literally as soon as I stopped talking he started online shopping again like I hadn't said anything. Given that I was talking about really heavy stuff it felt weird but I didn't say anything. A few months after I was hospitalised I was talking to him on a date night about something related to the traumatic incident, after a trigger. he (in an angry/irritated tone) told me to stop talking, that we were having a nice time and he didn't want to hear it/talk about that right now. I was pretty shocked at his tone mostly and became quiet. Since then we've talked about it and he's apologised, but I haven't been able to let it go and I haven't spoken to him about it since (about a year ago).

In the past few months he's told me that he told a few of his friends what happened and about my hospitalisation, without my permission. Most recently he told a friend a few nights ago. I get that he needs to talk about it all too, but I asked him to talk to a professional to talk to and to get personal support from, and he's just refused saying that I dont get to tell him what to do or pressure him to see a psychologist. It feels really sickening to know he told them about it as I dont know them and I hate knowing that they know personal stuff about me. It took me a long time to tell my boyfriend and its not something I tell anyone.

Also my mental health is really bad, and sometimes I have really rough patches. They're less frequent than they used to be but when its really bad (like once every 3 -4 months) it usually culminates me in drinking to black out (usually only one night) and crying a lot/generally being a huge mess. He's made it clear that its really hard for him to deal with me when I'm going through a rough patch, which I totally get. He says he also suffers with his mental health and that its really hard because he doesn't know how to help me. Most recently this happened about 2 weeks ago. The next day he was quite cold so I asked him what was going on and whether he wanted to take a break, and he said he didn't know and that he didn't know how to handle it all. That broke my heart because it made me feel like such a burden and like I was ruining his mental health. It also kind of pulled the rug out from under me because I felt like I couldn't talk to him anymore about it as I'd push him away if I did. We talked about it a few days later and I explained how I felt but nothing changed in reality.

Now last night we had a big argument about him telling his friend (A). It came up because another one of his friends (C) is having a MH crisis and my boyfriend told A about my situation. After my boyfriend told me he told A my stomach sank but offered to talk to C because he was making credible suicide threats and I wanted him to know how to get help. I was really worried and I was asking my boyfriend for updates on C, and at one point my boyfriend snapped at me after I expressed concern that C was refusing to get help, telling everyone he was fine now and felt better. I dont remember exactly what he said but a super rude tone, telling me not to lecture him on what to do about his friend, and that I was basically telling them they were all doing a terrible job. I was so hurt because it was all super personal to me and I was probably over invested as I know what its like to be in Cs position, but I was just trying to make sure they knew how serious his situation was (and it really was, he had a full plan and had gone part way through executing before reaching out for help). Getting snapped at really hurt me. This ended up getting into a big argument a few days later about how boyfriend had told A. His immediate reaction was, like always, to say 'I feel so awful I'm so shit I always let you down', and I snapped because it felt so manipulative - whenever I raise issues with him it always ends up with me reassuring him that he's not shit and that I am just overreacting, that its a small issue and its not his fault because its so hard to deal with me. And it makes me feel like I'm the cause of all our problems because I'm making him feel like shit for everything.

I'm also worried I'm being a bit gaslit as his other thingis to get exasperated when I raise an issue and tell me its nothing, that he didn't mean it that way, etc. As part of this he has straight up lied to me to try to get out of issues before. For eg, I have problems with sex when my MH is worse, and he used to make jokes about how long it had been since he'd had sex/gotten a blow job. These were not often but happened fairly regularly. Once a few months ago he made three small jokes about how he hadnt gotten head in ages in the space of a few hours and I lost it at him, and he tried to lie and say I'd misunderstood him, etc. I remembered what he said word for word as it had been literally minutes before so I refused to budge and we argued about how he could think it was ever appropriate to make those kinds of jokes knowing about the cause of the trauma. He evnetually admitted he lied as he was scared at me being angry at him and said sorry, etc, we moved on and he hasn't made those jokes since. But it was really concerning that he lied to cover it up and tried to convince me I was wrong. He has done this with other things too but this is the best example I can think of.

There's been other issues too - he read my diary without permission (after I told him how much of a red line this was to me), for revenge after we got into an argument because he showed up at my place really drunk. He has been really rude in how he has spoken to me a good few times, which I cannot stand.

The issue is overall that I'm concerned that I'm the asshole here. He has definitely not had it easy with me, it must be so hard being in a relationship with me. He's made it clear that he's struggling.

Are these are all relatively small things that I need to just let go of? For the most part he is so, so loving and caring. I'm scared that I'm making a huge deal out of these things that are minor because of my issues. But at the same time I'm worried I'm ignoring serious red flags that I have ignored in the past. But is it unfair to ask him to keep all that to himself (except for a professional, who he still refuses to see. Money isnt as issue, mostly government funded here with just a small gap fee, plus he's on a huge wage).

Listen. I‚Äôve been friends with this guy for about a year now. We‚Äôre both very busy people so the communication tends to stay at a minimum, but when we do talk, it‚Äôs for hours. This is not a one way friendship by any means, we both make an effort to reach out on a regular basis.

Lately, the whole experience with my friend has made me a bit confused about what is the criteria of a romantic relationship to that of a friendship.

Some key things to note here:

my birthday was 2 weeks ago and he sent me a 2 minute voice memo telling me how amazing, sweet and one of a kind I am. Very detailed, back to back compliments on my character that I‚Äôve never been told by anyone before

says he feels ‚Äútethered‚Äù to me, whatever that means

drunk texted me last night and was telling me how he was out bar hopping with his friends all night when in the back of his mind he was thinking of me. In the same string of texts he also showered me with compliments, said how conversations with the avg person is like white noise, but with me it‚Äôs totally different

said he‚Äôs only keen on being sweet to me (this was one of his drunk texts)

The next day I texted him and he seemed awfully embarrassed about the whole interaction, said he wanted to bury his head in the sand as he knew he texted me, but didn‚Äôt quite remember the conversation.

In the West, we do everything 50-50 and if the woman chooses, she can stay home and look after the kids but this is thoroughly discussed and planned in advance according to the requirements/finances of the family. 

I hope I am not taking the wrong but this seems to be a 'gold-digger' type of mentality. Some women said they are not supposed to contribute to general expenses and their money is theirs (if they work) and the mans' money is for the family which is totally wrong.

I came in the condom and put that condom aside. She asked me to go down on her, which I did. While I was doing it, she took her phone and started recording me. I grabbed her phone as soon as I saw that and insisted on deleting the videos. She secretly did something (I think she deleted them) and denied that she recorded me. She eventually showed me the photos and recently deleted folder with no photos of mine. (She did do something on her phone though before that, I think she deleted them at that moment, idk). I felt disgusted, so I took my stuff and left that place. Now I am worried about two things,

1. Will she share my videos online/ on only fans?
2. I left the condom with sperm inside at her place. Will she use it to impregnate her / blackmail me?

After coming home, I noticed on google maps that the apartment building she lives in is an assisted living for homeless, drug addict and low income people. Did anyone have this experience before?

I'm an Asian male and unfortunately, I'm about 5'4, 105 lbs and I have a baby face that often has me being told by strangers I look very young. It's flattering but not when it comes to dating because most girls see me as looking as if I'm 13 years old rather than someone they'd be interested in.

I've been bullied by Asian girls I remember quite fondly of in High School and it's caused self-esteem issues. I've managed to fall in love still for 4 years with a great girl unfortunately, when things got serious in terms of a post-college future is when it fell apart and our relationship fell apart with COVID.

So now I'm here at square one trying to get myself out there, because while a long relationship was hard, when I feel better about myself appearance wise I want to try dating again. Right now I'm trying to do the things necessary to work on my physical appearance like working out and gaining weight.

But if anyone in my shoes of looking too young has been able to transform themselves to look more mature I'd love to hear, and any advice from you guys and girls would be appreciated. Thanks!

Beforehand I want to say that this post is in no way and by no means meant to glorify myself or brag about anything. I am just going to list some things other people say about me often, aside from if I feel the same way or not.

Context:
I am 25, male and from the Netherlands.
Growing up on the autistic spectrum with also bodily handicaps made me deal with deeper, harsh and more serious aspects of life, hence why people usually call me 'an old soul' and I most of the time connect to older women most of the time because generally, they are also better for me to have deeper intriguing conversations and communication is just easier.
Connecting to middle aged 40+ women and also 50+ women feels like I'm finally comfortable because most of the time they are much more open minded and interested in me as well.
They always value the stories I have to tell, they like listening to me talk and they don't mind that I'm partly disabled but still mobile, they are very helpful.
I have a neurological condition so usually older women understand these things better as wel, so I can open up even more and give them more of my effort to make them comfortable.
Usually when I am in coversation with older women, they are really interested intellectually and romantically and they always tell me that, whatever it actually means.

Here's the problem.
I have no idea how to find them and the attempts I have made in the past were failing.
Autism for me is no excuse but factually and practically it makes things really hard because imagine going to a bar whilst you have sensory issues, a mildly spastic body with mini tremors because of your neurological wiring and then also a little bit of natural healthy tension of meeting new people.
The handicaps are robbing me of my opportunity to even show that I have a lot of confidence and deep down inside I am a chill person.
The reason why I like older women is, they usually look past my struggles with my bodily tremors and imperfections but they always listen to the me that is underneath that all.
So I need to find other ways to save my physical energy, but also I don't want to be resting all the time and not go out.

----------------
I was wondering if people have any tips on this for me:

Are there special dating sites or places for younger guys to connect with older women?

Is there something else that might me of help?

I don't think I could fall in love with somebody if I examined the relationship in terms of love/sex from the start. When I look at a man I meet in real life I never immediately think about whether he'd make a good partner or if I'd like to sleep with him. To me this way of judging people is just a terrible turn-off, especially if I know the other person is probably judging me in a similar manner.

Besides, I feel like online dating has turned into this exhausting job interview situation where you go for a few first dates per week, cross out some candidates and move on to the next CV folder. (That is if there even is a next CV folder. Where I live the dating apps run dry sooner rather than later.) It's hard to make anything feel special.

So one of my best friends (30) doesn't go on dates I think he hasn't had sex in 10 years at least. He allways says that hes not good looking and stuff like that, looks decent, has a stable job, car and so on...doesn't talk about girls at all, avoids the topic as mutch as possible. Im starting to wonder is he gay or not üòÇ.
He allways goes to sports bars and it seems he avoids places that has girls in them.
