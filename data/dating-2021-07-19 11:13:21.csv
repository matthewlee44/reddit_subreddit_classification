We’ve been spending most weekends together at his place and he’s always been almost all the time so affectionate and telling me he loves me. He even wrote me like a small paragraph thing yesterday saying how he misses me and wants to talk to me so bad. Calls often usually. Today nothing. Radio silence. I sent him that heart but now I feel stupid. He dotes on me always so this feels super weird. He always checks in, even saw that I was online

2,onhvut,1626713090,How can I be more supportive when girlfriend’s acne flares up?,"So pretty much what the title says. My gf has dealt with bad breakouts of acne on her face since we’ve started dating over 3 years now. Most of the time it’s fine and she seems to take really good care of her skin. So when she gets these breakouts that seem terrible to her she gets really angry, frustrated and sad. It comes out and sometimes in my direction but I’ve learned to try and not take it so personally. 

When this happens she gets visibly angry, may yell and throw things and then leave the home either on a walk or whatever. It can take sometimes an hour or more before she is calm and ready to talk.

I understand she’s not angry at me but when this happens it impacts my mood and feelings as well. She doesn’t want to talk to me about anything and tells me to leave her alone. I feel as if I can’t do anything to help. Anything I say is wrong and isn’t helpful so I end up just leaving her be.  Is this appropriate? Is there more I can do to help bring her back down and not be so upset? Or should I just let her work through the emotions on her own and process her feelings.  

I just want to be helpful or be there for her in the best way possible without making things worse which I tend to do.

Upon arriving, I noticed a lot of delicious looking restaurants that are local to the area. One in particular I pointed out and told my boyfriend I definitely wanted to visit. After arriving to the hotel, his family suggested we go out to lunch. I told them about the restaurant I found but they insisted on chili’s. Next for dinner, there was a toss up between outback or Cheesecake Factory. We went to cheesecake which I guess was the better option. Next day, dinner time rolls around. I suggest the local restaurant again and they finally caved. There was no talk of it all day so I didn’t make a reservation. There was an hour wait which my boyfriend and I were fine with because we are used to going to nice restaurants where we almost always have to wait. But they wanted to leave to go to outback. My boyfriend and I stayed behind and had a lovely meal at this one of a kind restaurant. When we got back to the hotel, my boyfriend boasted about how good it as and I also agreed that it was one of the best restaurants I’ve ever been to. Since then, his family has been weird towards me. I physically feel ill after eating at chains because of the poor food quality. I grew up always going to nice/local restaurants with my family and the only chain I have ever visited with my family is the capital grill.

I’m M24.

I’m going to try keep it short.

However, somehow we stuck conversation. But they were behind their friends so they left after 15 minutes. So I thought whatever, I will just read.

An hour passes and they return, with their two friends. And they came to me saying what a nice guy I was. I noticed the two other friends. A Belgian and an American. The belgian girl was shy. And the American, being welcoming like they always are. 
Anyhow, I offer them some beers I have in my bag (Rule 1 of paddle boarding, you never know what happens, so always bring beers!)

We keep talking, and they stay for 30-45 minutes. They have to return the kayaks as they were rentals. But then the American says I should come to their party (They May or may not be throwing this friday). I said sure, and we swapped contacts.


Now, the thing is. Americans) are known to be welcoming, but they might not mean it (unlike in my country, where people only invite if they really mean it).

Now, I think all the girls were gorgeous, but mostly the Belgian girl. I haven’t heard from them since we met ( 2 days ago). And I’m not sure the invitation to the party was sincere.

With my friends I'm outgoing, loud, always down to have fun. With her I feel stoic and I need my space away from her. It actually annoys me when she wants to spend more than a designated number of hours together, and sometimes I avoid committing to plans. 

I've noticed that over the months there's little things about her that turn me off. Her grooming or habits, her approach to situations (she's so much more emotionally expressive than I am that it overwhelms me sometimes), the fact that we're very different people and don't have things to do in common. I'm sure she feels the same way about this and it's the root cause of a lot of our arguments.

We're also in different phases of life. I live far from my family and am fully independent. I do everything for and by myself. She lives with her family, so has fewer responsibilities and is a lot more carefree.

I'm trying to understand more about whether my approach to this relationship needs to change? I feel like I'm not in it a 100% and that I need to reevaluate whether I want to be in it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/onihhw/m27_im_being_put_off_by_my_girlfriend_and_i_dont/

I've mentioned that I can see what he 'likes' before and said ""wow you like a lot of girls pictures"" and he said it was weird that I could see that and weird I would bring it up. I said it's not weird, it's public and I can see it.... then he changed the subject.

When a guy asks for your number, in the context of they just met you , does this mean they are trying to seek something more from you (whether that's a date, hook up, etc.) ? If you accept giving it to them, is that saying you are interested back? And is it an asshole thing to do to just outright deny giving them my number since I know I do not want a hook up/relationship?

I'm not opposed to making friends at all, but I also don't want my friendliness to be mistaken as interest in them romantically/sexually (I'm ace so I do not want any hook ups either) if that's what they seek. But I also don't want to be a jerk if its not and I'm just automatically assuming its because they are looking for more.

In the past I've felt like I was kind of a jerk, because I gave a guy my number and then like two texts in told him I wasn't interested and it seemed to bum him out.

Before I get too far into details I’ll tell you there is no shortage of beautiful women in the Charleston area. I’m in the food and beverage industry and the women to men ratio is quite insane actually, even in this industry. 
With this point being made I’m noticing something about myself that would have been quite out of my nature a year ago— I want absolutely NOTHING to do with any of them. Friends? Sure why not. But dating? It’s like a switch just went off one day and the whole prospect seems terrible to me. Pre-COVID I was dating a woman ten years older than me. Her and I would argue about minute things, she would block me, and then unblock me and we would go out to dinner, do the deed— this would continue for months at a time. But I still don’t think the fact this relationship was so inconsistent is the issue.
Because I’m noticing most of my issue isn’t the person themself but the responding, and developing a connection. It’s almost as if it’s a burden on me. I mean I have been interested in people in the past few months and I would just bury myself by not responding. It’s almost as if someone turned off the extrovert in me and turned on the introvert. 
I do however notice myself being stacked with stress most days however. The industry has been quite erratic since COVID-19 first started, and not much has been easy for me since covid first started. 
At this rate I just want to know if anyone has ever felt this way before? 
To be fair the prospect of dating for me won’t be realistic for another month or so due to EXTREME financial distress. When I say extreme I mean I don’t even have $20 to my name so bringing a girl on a date would be a hell no. I just want insight— anyone ever been in my shoes before? What gives?

21,onjkhz,1626717918,Advice on a Girl,"In general, my girlfriend and I don't really hang out more than once per week. I am almost always the one to initiate a hangout or date, and she generally prefers to just stay at my apartment rather than go out; I have to basically beg her to go out somewhere with me. She texts me daily, and sometimes asks me to call her to speak with her over the phone; so it's not like she doesn't like to talk to me. We have been together for a decent amount of time now. She is 17, turning 18 in September, and I am 19.

More recently, I feel like we've been spending even less time together. She has been hanging out with her one best friend a lot, and occasionally someone else. I told her that I wanted her to be the one to initiate the next hangout, and she agreed. She didn't ask me to go on any dates, or to hangout. She finally texted me telling me that she was going with her best friend to meet this guy (let's just call him John). For some context, she will text other guys and tease them, but never cheats or has any intention of making anything real of the situations. She thinks it's a joke, and shows me the texts. It's like a game to her. This guy John is one of the guys she teases. I called her, and asked why she was meeting up with a guy who was intent on trying to get with her despite the fact that John knows she has a boyfriend. I also told her that I found it inconsiderate that she had been prioritizing hanging out with so many other people before me; considering I had specifically asked her to be the one to make plans next. She told me that she was going anyways, and was going to continue to text guys in this way regardless. She told me that it's part of her personality, that she thinks it's funny, and that she isn't going to change it. She also told me that she would understand why I would doubt her loyalty (which I don't, I just have a problem with the whole situation and don't trust the GUYS). 

After she hung out with that guy and her friend, she slept over her friend's house. She texted me today, and told me that she was surprised that this guy John wasn't weird like he was over texted, and was actually pretty normal. She had texted me while she was with him that ""OMG JOHN IS SO FUNNY. I HAVE SO MUCH TO TELL YOU"". This made me upset, and I responded asking, ""What's to tell if he was normal? I thought you said he was really funny? lol"". Long story short, she said she would just tell me the next time she saw me...yet she has not made any plans with me. Today she's going to hang out with her best friend yet again, because her friend failed her road test.

So there’s this guy I have been friends with and have been in contact with on and off for so many years but he wasn’t sober, was an alcoholic and he was hung up on his ex gf and was super honest about that.

Fast forward to a few months ago, he’s not sober but we hang out a few times I can tell he likes me and we hang out and do stuff but he’s not sober and I don’t tell him this but it makes me nervous. I can tell it affects his self esteem and he is very socially anxious (his mom thinks he is on the spectrum) so he is basically self medicating IMO. We kinda fall out of texting. Drifted apart, whatever. 

Last week I text him out of the blue out of genuine curiosity just seeing how he’s doing. Turns out he’s sober for a month now and on a med (that helps him not have withdrawals and makes it so if he drinks he feels sick), exercising, doing super well … I am in awe. We text a bunch just catching up and then he invites me to hang with him. 

We do and he even buys lunch. It was v nice and platonic. Right after that were hanging out still and my best friend invites me to a Blues concert an hour away. Which is usually not my thing as I’ve never really listened to them like that but I’ve changed since quarantine and I love trying new things now and leaving my comfort zone. She says all of my friends are coming and I should come even tho it’s extremely last minute and far. I say I want to go to him and invite him and he is very hesitant and nervous. I would be too. Meeting a girls friends and all lol. Then he says he wants to go and we decide I am going to my house to change first and I’ll meet him at his apartment cause it’s closer and we’ll go from there.

I shower, wear a dress and basically look like a lil Stevie Nicks. I go to his place he says “wow you look pretty” and we go to the concert. I get a drink. He does too. I end up drinking his tho he just has a literal sip. In the car said he had said he was nervous to not drink and then people ask why or look at him funny. I assured him my friends weren’t like that but whatever. The night goes on, I’m happy, tipsy having fun, dancing, really happy! I dance with my friends and with him. After, I was so glad that I went and he did too. I go home with him and as the night went on and he said you’re so pretty. It was little but I felt like it was sweet. We go to his and we go to sleep in the same bed together. I could barely sleep. The post concert high was buzzing in me even though I was trying to sleep before work. We were both inching towards each other the whole night. He is shy but cuddly I can tell. He touches my face and I kiss his hand. Then we kiss and cuddle the rest of the night. It was so sweet. It’s a tender level of intimacy for me and a first for me. I hate how kidding and cuddling makes me feel so exposed, I feel as though I love him already. I woke up feeling very exposed and nervous. I know it’s too early to tell but I’m just wondering if I’m missing red flags or if I should be doing something differently.

I feel out of my power and vulnerable. I don’t know how this person will like me if I seem so easy, I’m tired of looking easy. I don’t know how to build intimacy past this or if I can allow someone into my life again after my last breakup but it feels so good though. Most of all, and at the root of it I fear he’s so fresh into his sobriety that I feel like I don’t want to get my hopes up. I don’t want to hurt him or myself. 

Any and all advice appreciated!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/onjwkp/have_i_taken_things_too_fast/

The thing is, I feel like guys are never that into me. Like ive never had a guy pursue me. And im not talking about them chasing me and me putting no effort. I always reciprocate effort. This happens whether I have sex with them or not. I recently decided to change things up a bit and go out more, and I did meet a guy IRL but just my luck, he recently got out of a LTR. And then it sucks seeing others you’ve dated  (including my ex) be with new people but its just not happening for me.

After suspecting and not doing much about it I found out my gf had cheated on me and had a crush on my at the time best friend. I haven’t been the same person since. I’m still upset and can’t seem to shake this inferiority complex or that there’s no one else out there. 
What’s even worse I find myself being intensely jealous of my friend she had a crush on. I don’t want to feel this way. I know when I start to feel jealous and then the feeling just stays and I can’t get rid of it. 

I had so many regrets after that relationship. I feel so much worse than before the whole relationship started. I feel like a weaker more jealous anxious version of myself. I wish she would have just broke it off instead of telling me the truth all the time. I don’t really know how to move forward. I’m not excited to date right now. I just want my best friend back and to not feel this way around him. But I don’t know how to better.  Sorry for the rant I’m just in a terrible spot right now.

30,onkd5b,1626720210,Guy [30M] I’m [27F]dating is giving attention to girl “below our leagues”,"I know this is going to come off bad.

But I’ve been dating this guy for 2 months are so and everything was going great.

He would often make remarks about how he can’t believe how beautiful, smart,  and intelligent I am. How he’s lucky to be the one with me… how we have such common interests. His friends love me, parents love me, siblings love me.

Yes I know it was fast but maybe that’s the problem.

I agreed, he even would often talk of the future. Say he thinks I’m his match, etc.

I agreed.

Then he started getting distant and said he just needed time to work through his depression.

Basically left me hanging but would let me know he’s still thinking of me and he’s sorry…

Now as time passes, I’m feeling like maybe he lost interest? He doesn’t compliment me really anymore and if we hang, he’s not present.

This has caused me to have intense negative feelings so I looked at his Instagram and saw he was following some new girls. (I hate that I stooped this low) but when I checked a profile, there was a girl who he liked several of her “sexy pictures”.

And I don’t get it. I’m pretty fit, workout, constantly hounded by guys (&amp; girls), I’m really intelligent - went to private school, and am actually learning coding. I’m self-aware, often thinking heavily and able to articulate well, empathize, and all that. I’m learning a new language and some instruments, etc. I’m really caring and nurturing to everybody around me - I’ve been told this by friends and even him. I care a lot.


This girl is really out of shape and “trashy”. She tags her pictures like #booty and says things in her captions that are really classless and kind of gross. Not that showing your body is bad, it’s just the way she goes about it is tactless. She doesn’t seem too intelligent. And this isn’t me trying to rag on her, this is just really what I see.

I’m bisexual and this girl would be a serious NOPE.

At this point, I’ve just figured well, if those are the kind of girls he wants, then he’s not for me. And have decided to just delete his number and if I don’t hear from it, oh well.

It just really hurts because he praised me so high then goes after the opposite.

31,onknay,1626721046,Seeing Your Ex on Bumble... Ouch,"Hey guys,

Mainly just wanted to get this off my chest and see if anyone else can relate.   
I recently got back on the online dating scene, and apparently my ex had the same idea. Tinder lets you block certain people based on phone number, which I think is a nice feature. However, Bumble hasn't implemented that feature. Gotta say, that stung a little bit. I have recovered about 95% from our breakup. I was with her for almost a year, and it was a very serious, happy relationship. Marriage was on the table, etc.   


I hate to admit it, but maybe I haven't given myself enough time to heal before trying to date someone new. It's been almost 5 months. In that time, I've done nothing but improve. As much as it hurt to be dumped, in many ways the breakup was a huge blessing. Mentally, physically, financially, emotionally... I go to sleep every night truly impressed by my effort. I've never really felt that way about myself, and I've certainly been reaping the benefits of my efforts. All that being said, I really didn't expect to feel so shitty after coming across my ex on Bumble. Kind of a damper on the day and certainly brings back memories. I'm grateful for the lessons I've learned through the relationship and after, but damn.... Feelings can be a real pain in the ass.  


Anyways, just curious if anyone else has had the same unfortunate experience. Opinions welcomed. Hope everyone has a great week :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/onknay/seeing_your_ex_on_bumble_ouch/

35,onkv8m,1626721679,Something I learned today about myself that I should have learned a long time ago,"Hey everyone! I am 23 years old male, and today I realized something important. I know it's something that you hear every day, but I just want to share my sort of moment when I figured it out.  
I have been going to the gym almost every day the last month and a half, and honestly, it is something that I wish I had figured out way earlier. During this period, I would obsess most of the time for the fact that I am alone, for the fact that on the way I would see couples or cute girls that wouldn't even look at me. After all this time, I used to think that I was hideous or that I am too short ( I vented about this in this thread a couple of days ago as well.) At work, I have been doing well, but something doesn't seem right.   


I had long thought about this on the weekend, about why do I give myself such a hard time, what am I doing wrong when it comes to dating or self-image. Then it hit me.   


I am too obsessed with what the others' perception of me is, but I don't even pay attention to myself. I thought that I need to pay some attention to myself, not only to my image but also to dedicate myself some ""me"" time. So I did something, that I never thought I would do on Saturday by myself. I went shopping, and I enjoyed every single moment of it. There were moments where I struggled a bit with combinations, but I would sometimes ask a couple nearby or a group of friends what color goes with what. Shoes were in my opinion, the hardest part. That took me the most time (I remembered the speech of Rebecca in ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"").  


But that wasn't it. I woke up on Monday with a different mindset, and I thought ""Maybe I can do better at work as well, get a promotion, I don't see myself working as a software engineer my whole life (no disrespect, I love my job now, but I feel like I want to be more active, be in a position where you communicate with others). So I called my unit manager and told him that in a year and a half, I want to be either a project leader or a consultant. He said that it's usually tough, but he appreciated my passion and was surprised that I had that in me because he thought of me as the quiet type. I know that it's gonna take a lot of effort and hard work, but I think that's the way to go. I realized that you don't only develop as a professional, you develop as a person, with hopes and aspirations, you meet new people and everything. I went to the gym afterward, and usually, I would base my happy day there if I would get a look. But this time, I didn't care. I didn't pay attention. I was just doing my reps until failure, and I felt good when I got out of the place.  


What I am trying to say is, PLEASE, focus on yourself. At least that's what I think it is. If you first focus on what's important to develop you as a working individual, as a physique, or as a friend, go for that one. That's my goal, at least that's what I think in this stage of my life is. I really wasted a lot of years of my life by being worried about making an impression on others and impressing people that I didn't like, that it cost me my sanity and happiness. And this is not only for dating. Focus on being happy, and don't force yourself to be something that you are not because that will drain you. And that's what I've been doing wrong in dating, I have been trying TOO hard when all I needed to do was be myself.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/onkv8m/something_i_learned_today_about_myself_that_i/

49,onlk04,1626723725,I need the strength to accept it and let go,"after being single for 5 years I thought I had healed of what I just discovered is my “anxious attachment style”

I’ll give a little backstory on my situation. All I really want is encouraging words and insight to healing.

Where it all began:

I am (24F) who was dating (28M) for 3 months. When I met this guy I wasn’t searching for him at all. I met him organically at my job and actually turned him down, but I did let him know he was attractive. I just wasn’t looking for anyone at the time because I know I have a lot of personal growth to work on. Two people cannot come together as one when they are a hot mess separately. I wind up running into him again (at my job) and he tried again so I gave him my number.

We gradually began conversing and really clicked. He drew me in because he was very sweet and considerate. This is what I mainly look for in a partner. Bc I’m very even tempered and considerate.We had (what I thought) was true chemistry and connection. I hadn’t even felt this way with the father of my child who I was in a r/s with for 5 years. This man was also the VERY FIRST to ever in my life make me orgasm or even please me sexually.I was blind sided thinking he was the one (I know better now) but it was easy for me to believe this because I am an introvert. I’ve been with many guys and was never able to truly connect 


Where it all went wrong:

The night of July 4th we met up late night after I arrived back in town from visiting relatives. Obviously I had been drinking. Not heavily as I had sobered up a bit. But I can get a little agitated during this sobering phase. The guy and I were on FAcetime and I was being a bit rude and bossy (playfully).he was very angry by how I treated him (unbeknownst to me at this time) and spent the entire night not speaking to me. He woke up the next morning quickly kissed me and said he was gone (this wasn’t his normal behavior at the time) 

Basically I’m saying all of this to say, this day was the beginning of the end. I called him immediately after him leaving asking him to simply tell me what was wrong. He wouldn’t tell me that night and finally broke down with what the issue at hand was.

Its as if he was so angry he couldn’t move past this. I’m very calm tempered but he is obviously quick to anger. So after the beginning of all of this (July 4) we were never able to get back on the same page ! 

He had outbursts of temper tantrum throwing when we talked about it a few days later. He hopped in his car and sped off down the street during our talk . I tried to remain as non confrontational as possible yet still upset him

The next day he ended up apologizing and letting me know I didn’t deserve that but sometimes he bottles up his feelings and it manifests as anger. 
Things simply just felt different for me after these line of events. I feel I was triggered. I couldn’t believe he had let something that seemed fixable to me turn into such a big issue.

After this the vibe simply felt weird. All that mostly saved us was I am forgiving and the makeup sex. We had spent so much time together since we had met. Hours on the phone, dates, and simply enjoying e/o company. But I just “felt” he was distancing from me. He was around but I felt he was unhappy. I have a strong spirit of discernment as well. I began to think he only started an argument with me thus disrupting our peace because he wanted to drive a wedge between us (someone else,lost of interest etc)

Fast forward about 1week later we went on a date and we’re taking sweet pics together. I deleted some bc I looked silly and immediately ran across (unintentionally) a video of a woman playing with her kitty. I didn’t let it ruin the night bc I felt we were having such a great time and had already been beefing so I chose silence. 
He saw this incident play out and all he really had to say was you weren’t supposed to see that. And “she was teasing me huh” (bc I have slept with women) and I thought the vid was distasteful (doesn’t apply to situation but she wasn’t even aroused it was pointless lol)(neither here nor there) 
His defense in this was when we argued he didn’t think we would speak again so he ran to others. 

He went from calling me his girl and wanting me to meet his mom to “we’re not even together, “we’re not even that close” “I barely know u so idk it’s worth fighting for” etc etc. basically words that pierced my soul.  He even said people from his past were “confusing him”


up until this point he aggressively pursued me. At one point I even told him we both need space (bc things cooled off and got “boring”) we were together almost daily
Space never came bc he wouldn’t leave me alone and that made me leave him alone even less (even when I felt urges to do so)


When I expressed 2,3 days ago I didn’t think he cared about me AND felt he was unhappy it only made things worse. No reassurance. The sweet guy I once knew has disappeared. I should also mention I began sending paragraphs and lashing out when he began to ignore me (my fear of abandonment/rejection manifesting as anger) saying things like I hate u,u don’t care about me, F you etc

Our last phone convo trying to explain it all I let him speak for 9min uninterrupted and asked did he get it all out. I began speaking my piece and he immediately began to get angry saying I’m NOT making sense and he doesn’t see what point I’m trying to make he simply got mad and said “BYE!” Then hung up. We haven’t spoken in 3 days. Only then was i able to reflect on the fact we hadn’t Been the same in 14 days. 14 days of disconnection (because it all started july4,got better,got worse,then ended July 17

I take things like this at face value and haven’t tried to contact him since nor will I try to. If everything he presented to me was real it wouldn’t have all simply gone up in smoke. I’m able to talk through issues but when I feel rejected,like I’m not being heard, or like someone isn’t being direct with me by saying “look it’s over” I’ll become fixated on getting the truth to align with what my mind is telling me


Takeaway:

I just want to heal from this and put it behind me. I realize it’s a dead end

I wind up running into him again (at my job) and he tried again so I gave him my number.

We gradually began conversing and really clicked. He drew me in because he was very sweet and considerate. This is what I mainly look for in a partner. Bc I’m very even tempered and considerate.We had (what I thought) was true chemistry and connection. I hadn’t even felt this way with the father of my child who I was in a r/s with for 5 years. This man was also the VERY FIRST to ever in my life make me orgasm or even please me sexually.I was blind sided thinking he was the one (I know better now) but it was easy for me to believe this because I am an introvert. I’ve been with many guys and was never able to truly connect 


Where it all went wrong:

The night of July 4th we met up late night after I arrived back in town from visiting relatives. Obviously I had been drinking. Not heavily as I had sobered up a bit. But I can get a little agitated during this sobering phase. The guy and I were on FAcetime and I was being a bit rude and bossy (playfully).he was very angry by how I treated him (unbeknownst to me at this time) and spent the entire night not speaking to me. He woke up the next morning quickly kissed me and said he was gone (this wasn’t his normal behavior at the time) 

Basically I’m saying all of this to say, this day was the beginning of the end. I called him immediately after him leaving asking him to simply tell me what was wrong. He wouldn’t tell me that night and finally broke down with what the issue at hand was.

Its as if he was so angry he couldn’t move past this. I’m very calm tempered but he is obviously quick to anger. So after the beginning of all of this (July 4) we were never able to get back on the same page ! 

He had outbursts of temper tantrum throwing when we talked about it a few days later. He hopped in his car and sped off down the street during our talk . I tried to remain as non confrontational as possible yet still upset him

The next day he ended up apologizing and letting me know I didn’t deserve that but sometimes he bottles up his feelings and it manifests as anger. 
Things simply just felt different for me after these line of events. I feel I was triggered. I couldn’t believe he had let something that seemed fixable to me turn into such a big issue.

After this the vibe simply felt weird. All that mostly saved us was I am forgiving and the makeup sex. We had spent so much time together since we had met. Hours on the phone, dates, and simply enjoying e/o company. But I just “felt” he was distancing from me. He was around but I felt he was unhappy. I have a strong spirit of discernment as well. I began to think he only started an argument with me thus disrupting our peace because he wanted to drive a wedge between us (someone else,lost of interest etc)

Fast forward about 1week later we went on a date and we’re taking sweet pics together. I deleted some bc I looked silly and immediately ran across (unintentionally) a video of a woman playing with her kitty. I didn’t let it ruin the night bc I felt we were having such a great time and had already been beefing so I chose silence. 
He saw this incident play out and all he really had to say was you weren’t supposed to see that. And “she was teasing me huh” (bc I have slept with women) and I thought the vid was distasteful (doesn’t apply to situation but she wasn’t even aroused it was pointless lol)(neither here nor there) 
His defense in this was when we argued he didn’t think we would speak again so he ran to others. 

He went from calling me his girl and wanting me to meet his mom to “we’re not even together, “we’re not even that close” “I barely know u so idk it’s worth fighting for” etc etc. basically words that pierced my soul.  He even said people from his past were “confusing him”


up until this point he aggressively pursued me. At one point I even told him we both need space (bc things cooled off and got “boring”) we were together almost daily
Space never came bc he wouldn’t leave me alone and that made me leave him alone even less (even when I felt urges to do so)


When I expressed 2,3 days ago I didn’t think he cared about me AND felt he was unhappy it only made things worse. No reassurance. The sweet guy I once knew has disappeared. I should also mention I began sending paragraphs and lashing out when he began to ignore me (my fear of abandonment/rejection manifesting as anger) saying things like I hate u,u don’t care about me, F you etc

Our last phone convo trying to explain it all I let him speak for 9min uninterrupted and asked did he get it all out. I began speaking my piece and he immediately began to get angry saying I’m NOT making sense and he doesn’t see what point I’m trying to make he simply got mad and said “BYE!” Then hung up. We haven’t spoken in 3 days. Only then was i able to reflect on the fact we hadn’t Been the same in 14 days. 14 days of disconnection (because it all started july4,got better,got worse,then ended July 17

I take things like this at face value and haven’t tried to contact him since nor will I try to. If everything he presented to me was real it wouldn’t have all simply gone up in smoke. I’m able to talk through issues but when I feel rejected,like I’m not being heard, or like someone isn’t being direct with me by saying “look it’s over” I’ll become fixated on getting the truth to align with what my mind is telling me


Takeaway:

I just want to heal from this and put it behind me. I realize it’s a dead end

52,onm4v2,1626725419,How long should you back off a girl?,"Hi all. I've been on 3 dates with this girl. We've been talking since the end of April and have had a few dates together and each one has been great. 

She's shown me that she cares. She's texted me in the mornings when she knows I've had a lot on my mind and after seeing her 3 times now it's evident that there is chemistry. 

We talked a few days after our last date and agreed that we don't want to commit (yet) but want to continue dating and continue what we've been doing. 

Me personally, I've been single for 4 years, so a while. I'm getting to the point where I'm getting excited and need to control my feelings. I've NEVER shown any signs of neediness or smothered her/double texted or anything like that. 

We were both out and about with our friends Friday and she asked if I was okay. I flirt only said I'm hanging by a thread and she said ""nooo stay alive please"". She also playfully calls me ""boo"" and said that to me yesterday. 

Lately I feel like I've been the one to ""make the first move"" and feel like we won't talk unless I hit her up. She's responsive and we seem to have a conversation but then she will eventually not respond and I wait a day or so and reach out to her again. I feel like i need to back off. 

While I understand her not replying could likely be not related to me at all, I don't want to fall into the habit of over analyzing and overthinking, which I know I'm starting to do with her now. 

Last week she DID reach out to me first and we talked for a long time. I don't remember our communication patterns when we first started talking honestly, but now that I'm starting to like her I'm starting to think about these things more. 

I plan on not reaching out for maybe 2-3 days. We've never gone this long without talking at least briefly, so I'm hoping she notices and reaches out. We used to have a really long snap streak but that got broken a few days ago. She still will snap me and text me though. 

She liked my Instagram post shortly before she left me on read yesterday. She commented heart faces on another post I made last month when I posted it and even when I do reach out she is responsive and doesn't blow me off. 

She is gone out of town these next 4 weekends. I was talking to her about plans for another date and when she told me she's gonna be gone, she said we will find time. 

After 2-3 days I plan on maybe hitting her up to see how she's doing (if she doesn't reach out to me). What's a good way to start a conversation like that?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/onm4v2/how_long_should_you_back_off_a_girl/
53,onm87k,1626725693,I had my first ever date and it was so easy!,"So I’ve (M23) been talking to this girl (F23) for a little over a week and last night we finally went out. Conversation over text has been great and we text everyday from morning til bedtime. 

Before the date I did plenty of research on how to kiss and first dates and the whole nine yards. Just to be prepared I even went out to the pharmacy to buy condoms like an adult ( hey I thought I needed to learn this experience and now I know). Turns out I didn’t really need any of that. 

So then we finally went out to a “barcade”. She ordered my drink as I’m not a big drinker and told her to pick spontaneously. I had a gin and tonic and it went straight to my head about 30mins later. Anyways we played some arcade games and the conversations flowing great with some light touching and flirting. 

The night winds down to a foot race to the car and some very flirty banter on the way back to her apt. When I drop her off, I walk her up to the door and ask to kiss her goodnight. Bam! My first kiss ever. She pulls me in hard and crabs my collar and there was definitely some tongue present. By far one of the weirdest experiences/sensations of my life…but in a good way. 

Needless to say I had a good time and enjoyed myself. She did too apparently as she texted me this morning how she wishes the kiss was longer. Crazy, I thought I was terrible. 

I’m not sure how to feel right now as like I’ve never experienced love or the feeling of falling in love. She’s not my usual type physically but she is attractive, witty, and a big flirt and seems to want more but I don’t want to rush anything. 

I know I’m happy but I don’t know what to expect and that’s what I’m most curious about.  I’m not head over heels for her or ready to commit 100% so I’m just seeing where it goes and enjoying the conversation and flow. 

I went in with the mentality of two friends just hanging out and it seemed that worked. I wasn’t nervous or anxious or anything. I’m really just amazed at how easy it was and not like the movies at all!

So I have just been rejected again recently and this got my thinking. What has gone wrong up to this point? Lets address the elephant in the room. I am a virgin and as of next month I will be 26. My peers have all left that behind in there late teens but unfortunately the burden gets heavier for me. I guess I am probably not the only one but I think I should state some facts about myself which upon reflection will seem almost bizarre. I have a mortgage on a 3 bedroom house which I live alone in, i have a good job, I dress well and I am very hygienic and take care of myself, I keep fit and eat well, I am confident and outgoing and will not be shy to approach and talk to people. I take responsibility and try to self reflect on every shortcoming and failure I have so in this particular instance I am starting to get stumped with what it is that goes wrong 100% of the time. My recent rejection was actually a hard hitting one for me as we had a lot of interests and even worked in the same fields I guess for many it would have been a sure thing. She was also going for the mortgage which I already have so I thought we were on similar wavelengths only to be hit with the same outcome I had first experience when I was 15. I guess I am just stumped at this point and I am running short of plausible explanations as to what is going wrong. I also want to know what the current stigma for late 20s virgins are? Should we be honest about it or should we hide it fir a better chance going forward?

68,onnfrk,1626729347,"So yeah, it's been a month and a half since we broke up...","Long story, tl;dr on the bottom

We met on Tinder, she (22F) had quite a busy life. Goes to an equally hard college as mine (24M), but she is an entrepeneur as well. People contact her mostly for marketing but she started a business of hers as well during the 3 months we dated.

The first 2 months were great. Saw each other quite often in person, we talked a lot, discussed, and helped each other when the one was feeling down. I'd cook sometimes for her, even bring her the food to her apartment when she was sick. She had migraines often and was ridden with allergies. Has a family history of breast and skin cancer and what not.

Then it started, we didn't see each other in person for a month.

In the beginning, one of her friends came to visit her, and they were going out Friday and Saturday, when they picked up some disease which made them both vomit to the point they had to go to the hospital.

Honestly, I kinda wished to meet her friend, since apparently, it was her best friend, and she met some of mine already.

Anyways, then she spent a few days in the hospital, I went to my hometown, and then she had an important exam. Came back from my hometown the day before her big exam, brought her a present, left it at her door and messaged her. Didn't want to really disturb her studying too much before the exam.

After she finished, we went to a restaurant, to celebrate passing our exams with flying marks and to commemorate the 3 month status. It was great. Finally heard it out of her mouth first that we were exclusive (I'm not the type of guy to pressure her to much) and she wanted to take picture of us.

&amp;#x200B;

Her grandmother's state got worse, she went back to her hometown. She wasn't really replying to my messages and I asked her what's wrong. And that's when she decided to break up with me over messages. (now, I'll be paraphrasing the first few messages so none of the sentiment gets lost in my post, but the ones later on will be translations with as much of the meaning kept as possible)

She told me that maybe it'd be better for me to find someone who also lives a normal student life like I do (I knew what I signed up for in the beginning), she said she was bad material for anything but career, not usually but at this moment of time and she doesn't want anyone to waste time on her, especially not me because I don't deserve it.

I didn't want to break up because honestly, she inspired me to improve in some aspects.

I told her to maybe think it through because I know she was going through a rough patch and I wanted to be there for her.

Then she mentioned her ex. Not really the first time she mentioned him, as a matter of fact, she did mention a few times that it is because of that one particular ex that she has the ability to be an entrepeneur the way she is. Now, she mentioned him in the context of: 

""I know how it is to date someone who is bad in putting the same amount of effort you do, and that's how I felt with my ex until he thought me entrepeneurship and then we started working together and that's when I finally felt good in my relationship with him.  
You always put in effort and you're killing yourself over me and I'm just horrible at it all. I don't like it at all and I feel so bad, even though I feel great when I'm with you but I always feel this pressing in my head that I should do more because I can do more.   
I really can't find a fault in you or anything, everything is great, but it's so not fair to you. I think any sane person would kill themselves of the guilt.""

Then we went on and on, and I finally said (out frustration and bad memories, I know, not an excuse): ""Look, this isn't the \_\_\_ I know, and this whole thing sounds like a cliche to me, saying that I'm too good for you and that it's because of you. Sounds like something a coward would say and who doesn't want to take on the responsibility."" Honestly, I just couldn't fathom that a reason to break-up with me would be beacause I was too good.

Do note, she was also going through a rough patch, and then she replied a bit more agressively:

""I never said I wasn't a good catch because I don't think so. I know I'm a high-value woman that has a lot behind her and I know I'm an excellent catch. Fact remains, I can't give anyone anything of quality for the next 2 years, neither to you. And how much sense is there in waiting 2 years for me, I don't think there is. If you do want me to look super selfish in this whole thing, then OK, you can stick with the story that I don't want anything now because I don't want to have a guilty conscience on my mind so that's why out of pure selfishness I'm breaking up with you. But don't keep bullshitting me that I'm a coward and that I'm not interested in you. Get a grip, I'm in business as well and I don't hold back and I don't have any qualms telling someone what I think, and I wouldn't have a problem telling someone I lost interest in them either nor it would be my first time. If you want to put up with how it is currently (She is referencing us seeing less and less in person. And maybe me putting in a lot more effort into the relationship?) Either way, I'm so mentally exhausted due to everything that's happening around me, what privately, what in the business sense that I don't have the for anything else other than my training at the end of the day and even that I don't do every day.""

I never said she was selfish, I know she'd make an effort whenever she could. But, something just happened at the end. And I wished her luck and bid farewell.

&amp;#x200B;

3 hours later, she messaged me:

""I'm sorry, you were right, I was in the moment, I just came back from visiting my grandma and I had a migraine, I had to get off the phone, I was just torn apart with everything. But this just shows you how I'm not in the state of mind during this period of my life.""

Kept through with my decision of respecting her first decision of breaking up, because I feel as if I shouldn't beg someone to spend time with me. I created time. I studied late at night so I could spend more time with her. I tried to connect her with my friend group so it's a bit easier organising time. I'd cook sometimes just so she doesn't have to worry about that. I'd spend more time in her place no matter how cramped it was.

I still kind of feel guilty for abandoning her at a rough time in her life. I see she even updated her IG profile picture with the picture of her with flowers after our restaurant date.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr

Had the most affectionate 2 months of my life, the third month was kind of ehh except the restaurant date which was perfect in every possible way, but a few days later, she broke up with me because I was too good and I feel guilty for abandoning her and I miss her.

I don't see how this form of discrimination is any more justifiable than sexual orientation, race or gender discrimination.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/onnjcr/agesegregated_events_is_it_politically_incorrect/
70,onnkxh,1626729778,30F and running out of hope,"Hi all

30-year-old single woman here who is tired of watching everyone around her get married, have babies, buy houses together, and live the life I’ve always wanted. And depressingly, I know I’m not the only one.

When I was a kid (I wanna say around 12 years old) and was made aware of what love was, I dreamed about it. Even to this day I dream about finding my person. You can have opinions about how toxic the idea of ‘the one’ is and I respect that opinion (and have done a lot of reading on it), but it is not the opinion I hold. I do believe in some kind of magic when it comes to love, sue me.

I have had some of the **worst** luck dating. I have yet to reach longer than 9 months in a relationship; not for lack of trying either, I just have no experience in dating someone who doesn’t suck. I’ve been cheated on, dated lazy unmotivated guys, dated neglectful men who, even though I’ve basically begged for them to just acknowledge my existence, just never tried, men who are great for the first few months and then ultimately show me their true colours, and men who try to emotionally manipulate me. I have tried VERY HARD to give all of them the benefit of the doubt and given many of them multiple chances (because I know no man will ever be perfect and I don’t even want perfect) but all of these relationships ended because they just didn’t fuckin work out.The good thing though is that I’m very good at cutting it off when I know it isn’t going anywhere. I don’t waste my time. I give a certain amount of chances and once those run out, I end it.

I have tried dating apps. ALL OF THEM. I went on tons of dates. Unremarkable ones, creepy ones, ones that made me uncomfortable, ones that got a second and third date until I realized they were either already in a relationship or just fizzled out because they, not me, stopped trying.Eventually I gave up on all dating apps when I read more articles and watched more video essays about how destructive dating apps can be and I’ve made the decision to just never go on one ever again. I hate the idea of love being an ‘algorithm’ and I hate the vapid way they are designed, it’s basically online shopping for a human and I hate it. I don’t base my opinion on looks or ‘scientific matches’ and even the ones that were apparently my perfect matches ended up being awful experiences. I just hate the idea of love being treated like a chess game.

My friends have also tried to set me up with multiple people, but they’re all either unattractive (in MY opinion), have nothing in common with me, just want to have sex, are deadbeats with no drive or desire to be a better person, or other things that factored into them not ever working out. It’s almost becoming insulting at this point when my friends say things like ‘so you might like this guy I know, he has a kid and there’s a bit of bad blood between the baby momma and him because he was in jail for a bit, but he’s single and looking!’ That was an actual thing one of my friends said to me.I’m not desperate, and I will not drop my bare-minimum standards just to not be alone. I’m pretty strong in that regard.

I’m not picky either. I give a STUPID amount of chances and let a lot of things slide. I’m not looking for perfect. I’m just looking for the person I can wake up to every morning who I know loves and cares about me, and who I love and care about too and maybe has their life together. That’s it.

So why do I have such a terrible track record with this shit? Why does it feel like the universe has a sick sense of humour with me? I feel like it’s constantly shoved in my face that everyone around me is happy and making future plans with their partners except me. I’m in a family of 5. My parents have been happily married for 35 years, my middle brother has been with his (now fiancé) for 7 years, and my youngest brother just got married to the love of his life last year.I am ALWAYS the 7th wheel at family dinners.

I’m not ugly. I’m cheerful, happy, funny, I have a dark sense of humour, I don’t take myself too seriously, I have hobbies and interests and tons of cool life experiences, I’m laid back and understanding, I’m reasonable, I’m loving and dote on every one of my partners, and even though I have a bit of body dysmorphia (who doesn’t), objectively, I’m a pretty good catch. But I know love isn’t supposed to be what you are on paper. I (more than anyone) know that. On paper I’m great, yes, but that’s not really how love works.

So, what the hell is it then?! How am I supposed to do to find my person? It doesn’t help that the pandemic has everyone not socializing like normal, but even before covid I’d always put myself out there in hopes of meeting someone organically. Did it ever happen? Not really. And if I did meet someone organically, they were just a part of that list of duds I mentioned earlier.

The other thing I ***ABSOLUTELY HATE HEARING*** is the whole ‘just focus on yourself, it’ll come when you least expect it.’ People who repeat this lazy statement to me will be punched in the throat lol (jk).

1. I’m never ***not*** working on myself. I’m always working on being a better version of yesterday’s me. That won’t change or stop when I meet my person.
2. I am NEVER not expecting it. It’s literally the only thing I’ve ever wanted since I was 12, so I can’t exactly just shut that part of my brain off. And
3. I have been working on being successful in my career and life always. I’m not just moping around wishing for it to happen while not getting on with my life. I still have goals and plans that I work on despite being sad about not finding my person yet. So this phrase just makes me want to commit a hate crime when I hear it. Lol

I just don’t know what else to do. I don’t even think I’m looking for answers by posting this either. My dream has always been to find my companion, start a family, and be a mom. I’ve always wanted that. So what the fuck lol. My biological clock is ticking (and no, I don’t JUST want the babies part, I want the whole package companion and all) and I’m just losing more and more hope every day.

71,onnp87,1626730136,Is my coworker hitting on me?,"We've been working together for 5 months, started chatting, then seeing each other for last 2-3 months. We work 100% remotely. I don't know if she wants something or is just friendly towards me. We live like 3 min walk close to each other, so she visits me pretty often. What i can say:
-she texts me very often, almost everyday
-she comes over to watch movies at night or work with me during day. Sometimes we go to bar and work there
-she even tells me to invite her for a movie sometimes
-laughs at my jokes
-asks me when we're going to go to x, y
-went with me to watch football matches 
-invited me to three weddings
-we've been to one wedding, she said that had a lot of fun, it was noticeable. When we were coming bsck home, she  slept at my shoulder. I didn't go for sex though 

I'm not sure if she's being friendly or hitting on me. We work together and i find it hard to distinguish. I find it very risky to make a move in this situation. At first i was like yolo, i dont care, im not interested. Recently i started to think about her and maybe feel something else. She even slept at my place, because couldn't come back home.

Because of covid I know when the restaurants close so an hour after the closing time and before I went to bed I sent him a text asking if they were heading home?

So I said, “oh why didn’t you respond to my text then” &amp; he said he was too drunk. That annoys me.

Me: “Hey, there’s something wrong with my phone”

I texted him apologizing about what I said, that I knew it was a difficult subject to talk about and I was really sorry if it caught him off guard or made him upset. He never responded. I cry everyday about this. I just feel like such a worthless piece of shit, having shared something so so personal and difficult and then he just kicks me to the curb.

I met an attractive guy on there a while ago and we’ve gone on a few of dates since. We have lots of things in common (i.e we’re both dancers and into the same music) and I’ve been really enjoying the time we spend together. I was truly happy with the way things were going. 

Our 3rd date was last week and we were texting after we parted ways. At one point he randomly sent me a few pictures of *myself* (it was a bikini pic he got from my Insta as well as a selfie I sent him). He added that I look even better irl than in pics and called me a “reverse catfish”. To make things worse he added a rating which I thought was just gross. 

I just responded with “?” and he was obviously mortified as soon as he noticed. He immediately apologized and claimed that he didn’t mean it in a bad way and that he just finds me attractive and w/e. I asked him who the text was for and he said a friend. 

I’m obviously not feeling good about this. I don’t even think he finds me attractive since he doesn’t even like my pics(he did imply that my pics are worse than irl me) . I also find it super trashy that he’s going around sending his buddies my pics and passing commentary/ratings like that. It feels objectifying and gross. I’d never send my friends pics of my date and give him a rating out of 10. 

I’m in this weird situation where I still want to see him but I feel like this incident may be a red flag. He’s been very apologetic ever since and even got me flowers but I just feel like he’s doing all of this with no honest intentions. One of my concerns is that he’s not looking for a serious relationship (even though he claims he does) and that he’s just gonna use me for sex. Just the way he talked about me seemed so detached which makes me think he doesn’t want anything long term.

Went to the same school growing up, the same college, and now we live in the same city years later. Last week I get a random follow request in the middle of the workday. Took me by surprise to see this guy.

There isn't much to the story other than we grew up together, had mutual friends but never really hung out. Even in college, I saw him around campus but we never spoke. We matched on a dating app once and I messaged first but it didn't go anywhere.

A couple of years pass and here we are on Instagram. I accept the request and instantly he messaged me to ask how I have been. We make some small talk and he says, ""We should grab a drink sometime"" I tell him I don't drink and he says ""Then I can take you on a date."" I agree and then he starts to tell me he feels guilty, so I ask why. He says, ""I just got out of my first real relationship and I feel bad. You were the first person I ever had a crush on and I still think you're attractive"" I thank him and let him know he doesn't have to feel guilty since he was honest and we can just casually hang out. He lets me know he's busy all weekend and says some other time. I agree but he never messaged me back. He replied to something I posted on my story over the weekend but it was just an emoji.

It had to take some balls for him to reach out and tell me he liked me in the past, so why did this end up going nowhere? I have to admit this did pique my interest so I'm not going to just forget about it. But I am kinda wondering why reach out right after getting out of a relationship? And after all these years?

94,onqmno,1626739627,(24M) How am I supposed to stay positive and not get bitter about dating when my negative experiences with women far outweigh the positives?,"Now, let me preface this by saying I don't want to get bitter and I try to keep an optimistic perspective on things. I want to have positive experiences with women and don't want to get into a ""all women suck, woe is me mindset"".. But my dating experiences have certainly put my optimism to the test and I don't see how I'm supposed to maintain a positive outlook in light of all I've experienced.

&amp;#x200B;

My negative experiences with women have far outweighed my positive ones.

Women my age where I live seem to be super reserved more often than not; they tend to freeze up around me (look like a deer in headlights) and contribute very little to conversations and certainly don't start them, let alone flirt with me (never happens).

I've been wildly successful on Tinder in terms of hundreds/thousands of matches, messages, responses, numbers, dates/hookups. However, in the process I've had to persevere through lots of crap from women like time wasting, enthusiastically agreeing to dates and then ghosting, gaslighting me, cheating, not communicating clearly, love bombing and then abruptly dropping me, trying to trap me at their house.

Dating aside, I occasionally have had women messaging me out of the blue just to put me down and be super rude to me unprovoked. I certainly don't have women messaging me out of the blue to say something nice.

Yes, there's the ""well you dodged a lot of bullets so don't worry"" mindset but it's the fact that it's so lopsided with so many negatives and so few positives that gets to me sometimes. What makes it worse is that Reddit dating threads and my peers act as if someone ""like me"" is supposed to have such a super easy time with women being out of their way receptive but yet my experience has been the complete opposite.

It feels like I'm just supposed to persevere through an endless gauntlet of bullshit, getting a ton of negative experiences with little positive ones, while still somehow staying positive just to have the possibility of meeting a woman who's a good fit for me.

But how do I do this in light of all I've experienced?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/onqmno/24m_how_am_i_supposed_to_stay_positive_and_not/

When I was 16, this senior 18, John took me out with his friends. We went to a party that was wasted. He and two of his friends had sex with me. They called me a gross and ugly after. They ignored me for a while. John kept hooking up with me. Before all that happened, he was helpful to me and would hang out with me after he would only have sex with me if he was drunk and ignore me the rest of the time. He would never want to talk to me only about sex.



He left for the military over the years he kept in contact with me and saw me when he came home sometimes. He would only want to talk to me about sex or photos. He cheated on his girlfriend with me (I didn't know they were dating). He would have sex with me and ignore me. I went on vacation once, and my phone broke. He sent me at least 30 messages and was mad I didn't respond. He always implied that I was attractive enough to fuck but not date.



He would also imply that I'm weird or annoying. When I was 17, I tried talking to him about the trouble I was having at school. At first, he was sympathetic but then told me to speak to someone else. Because of what happened I was bullied in school, I tried to talk to him because I was lonely. After three years knowing him, he told me he wanted me for sex and nothing more.



That he felt no connection to me. It's been four years since all that, and I feel broken. He still tries to contact me trying to cheat on his girlfriend with me or see me again. I try to ignore him then he'll bombard me with texts it works to face time me. I moved away and didn't talk to anyone he knows. He still keeps photos of me and sends them to me, asking if I miss this. I feel so used and dirty. Something must be so wrong with me.



I blew up at him and blocked him finally. He was messaging me begging for pics, and he now lives with his girlfriend. I feel sick. He recently emailed me saying hey I called him a rapist, a waste of space, ugly, a coward, an awful person. I want this person to stop contacting me. I feel terrible. I haven't seen him for five years, but he still keeps original photos he took of me as a teenager he's says he took them because he thought I wouldn't mind.I thought he would have stopped when I blew up at him last time.



He acts like I'm a rude cause he says he's just like that and he's never done anything wrong to me. He even said,”I was drunk too. I didn’t take advantage of you. You just made the mistake of fucking me apparently. Yeah sorry I didn’t hit you up after but what did you expect? You think I haven’t been dealing with shit too? You think you’re the only one who’s got problems? Grow up. Stop taking out all your anger on me. I’m sorry I just use you for sex but I thought that was a part of our relationship that was mutually understood. Apparently not, once again.”



One time when I blew up at him, and he left me alone for a couple of months coming back trying to apologize to me then to come on to me sexually then I went off hard on him calling him scum and saying I wish he were dead also, he lives with his girlfriend Am I a mean person for sending these messages? Does that make me a bad person?
