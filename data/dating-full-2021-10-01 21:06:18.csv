Many women might say they don’t want to date a guy shorter than 6’ but if they meet an attractive 5’9 dude in person they vibe with? Totally fine. And if the guy is 5’5 but is exceptionally accomplished in his field and/or has a high net worth? Height no problem!  


Many guys say they are all about 50/50 and cheap casual first dates. However when they match with a totally stunning woman they treat it as a once in a lifetime chance and would desperately pull out all the stops to impress her. Fancy restaurants, gifts and of course they insisted on paying. I have even seen guys who claimed to be child free for many years suddenly changing their minds if they think the single mother woman in question is worth it (extremely beautiful, successful, great personality, widow or no drama with ex etc). 


And of course people sometimes do fall in love with someone who is totally not their type. 


Personally I’m into very fit women and only swipe right for that. However If I end up meeting an overweight woman with a cute face in person (originally). If she makes me laugh harder than never before, is also ambitious and successful, and she’s interested in trying to lead a more healthy lifestyle I’m not going to rule her out. 



I also prefer women who are educated and very accomplished in their careers, and again might swipe left on apps. However it I meet a woman in person and hear about how she’s so passionate about doing work for an important cause I might be swayed too.

However things started taking a shift recently. During the pandemic I lost so much weight (90lbs) and got into my dream MSc degree. I graduated this summer and signed a job offer after my summer internship, that was a month ago. It had been 6 consecutive years of studying and working excessively, I was extremely burnt out. I took my signing bonus and planned a trip solo, visited 8 of my favorite cities around the world and took really good pictures in each one (with a Fujifilm x-t200). 

Now I finally have a lot of things I never had before (job, money, fit body, mental stability etc). I'm getting on dating apps but honestly my first experience was traumatizing.

We became friends and would /still do hangout, go out for dinner, or enjoy each other’s company. I’ve gotten mixed signals - to be frank I’m bad at catching women’s signals. But we’ve gotten comfortable with each other in respects of conversation and being open about our work, life, family, etc. I know she’s single, sexless, and a shy homebody and not really too adventurous (conservative). As I been getting older I’ve been slowly learning to face my fears but am afraid of the consequences.

How can someone be so evil as to rationalize keeping someone in a relationship / situationship while also being unsure of what they want and actively looking for someone to replace their partner? 

It's spoken about so casually. I don't get it. As an adult aren't you supposed to realize that you're inflicting horrible trauma on your partner that will take years or even decades to resolve? Aren't you supposed to stop for a second and say ""hm, well maybe I should stop traumatizing them and wasting their time""? Especially when one of them is more in love with the other one. I genuinely do not understand how childish this behaviour is, and yet it's basically the norm in our society. 

Don't get me started on the ""oh we're just using each other"" trope. Nope. I will never understand how people will go out of their way to minimize entire months or years of time spent with another person. 

I think people use it as a flex, to an extent. For instance, they have such a good support system you can fall back on to whisk them away at a moments notice, so they blindly allow themselves to step on other people and form situationships while narcissistically focusing on their personal melodramas. Most people don't have the luxury of being able to go on a bunch of vacations or 'busy themselves' with their incredible lives after experiencing something so devastating. So why are we letting these types of people walk all over everyone else.

Today, we went on our second date, and ended up at my place again watching another movie. This time it was hell of a much more teasing from her side. She was touching me even down there, i was touching her, we kissed, she was on top of me and you can just imagine. I even got to take off her bra. But when I put my hand in her jeans she put my arm away and we started laughing. This happened like 5x times each time I was more hornier only to end up laughing.

She even asked me when I was driving her home, what's wrong? I said o, nothing and she just laughed again and kissed me. I texted her if everything was fine and she said yes, I've enjoyed the night and was wondering if we could watch another movie again tonorrow. I said fine, why not.

Hey reddit, hoping I can get some good advice here regarding who I am as a person and see if there are any other people like me and what they use to manage their feelings. This fatal flaw of mine is falling for people way too fast. It always happens to me, I start to talk to someone else and within a few days of talking to them they completely fill my head up, and almost every thought starts revolving around them and how much i like them and how much I want to build a future with them and imagining a future with that person almost immediately. This of course is something that I never mention to any of the people I have talked to before or dated before. Because a lot of people find that someone getting emotionally attached to someone too quickly is red flag, which is completely understandable or they will try and take advantage of this. 

This has happened to every single person that I have ever had any sort of romantic interest with, so when things don't work out, I find that I already had a strong mental attachment to the person so it really drags on me for a few weeks.  I am already a person that will go out of my way for others and really try to be the best I can possibly be for someone and looking back some people I have dated before in the past before have taken advantage of that fact. 

This just recently happened to me again where I started seeing someone (for about a month) and they completely filled up my mental space. Looking back on it they weren't a good match for me and that I had ignored some red flags just because of the way that I had already grown some sort of emotional attachment to them. I genuinely think I would have kept talking with this person much much much longer and putting up with some really questionable behavior from the other person however I only pulled back because my friend made me realize that they were kinda shitty and were using some borderline manipulative tactics on me (hot and cold cycles of attention, flirting with others in front of me) This is not the first time that this has happened to me.

I notice that this is a recurring theme when it comes to me talking with anyone, and I notice that this opens me up and leaves me emotionally vulnerable to some potentially really shitty and borderline manipulative behavior.

I think I get attached too quickly to people because I crave a stable source of romantic affection from someone because of some of my insecurities. I definitely see myself as someone who's mainly an anxious attachment type. 

I am trying to work on myself and be a better person, like dressing better, taking care of myself, really trying to improve my physique, but yet I still find myself falling hard for people that I shouldn't fall for. 

I really need some advice to help me be a better judge on people before my brain starts to irrationally making mental attachments to people and leaving me potentially emotionally exposed to bad intentions from people.

But now it seems like she's flopped back. Should I just leave her alone? I definitely don't want to make her uncomfortable at work yet I also don't want to potentially miss out on something great. I jokingly said last time ""You know what I am here to get you in trouble"" and she laughed and said O.K. She's also mentioned that she's not as confident outside of work and I feel like she's scared I won't find her interesting outside of her ""comfort zone"" if you yall my meaning.

Just here to rant. I am an incredibly prideful fucking person, which is why I fucking HATE developing strong feelings for a person.

I also hate how I can spend hours thinking about someone, but they don’t give me the time of fucking day.

Hey everyone,

So, my ex (21 F) and I (23 M) dated for about 7 months (the longest relationship I’ve been in), and she decided to end it a couple months ago or so. She’s originally from Spain and goes to college in England and was in the states for a year long study abroad. We lived in the same building, and we met in the shared kitchen. 

We hit things off and hung out a bit, and then things became romantic. She’s never been in a relationship, and her parents have always told her to not date/try to control her almost. Every time we’d hang, her mom would call and deliberately interrupt us. I’ve talked to her parents via text and email, and they liked me because I made their daughter happy. 

The main issues we had in our relationship were communication and expectations — she would often blow me off when I’d invite her over, even though my schedule is way busier than hers (she did research full time but didn’t have homework or studying, whereas I’m a dental student with exams every week). She thought I was “needy” because I checked in on her everyday and tried to maximize our time together because I knew she was gonna go back to Europe in the future. I cooked for her, bought her gifts for special occasions, and took her site seeing in our city. I feel like she never appreciated me and always reluctant to spend the night with me after hanging out late in my room. 

I even protected her from some creepy stalker who lived next door to her. I had to call the cops on him after he threatened to kill me when I told him to stop hitting on my girlfriend. I ended up having to eventually move buildings to get away from him (my parents were concerned about my safety, and my ex told me that she overheard him saying he’s been to jail before). 

So how things ended: her parents called us while we were hanging out and told her to break up with me since she was leaving in a few weeks. I told her to let us enjoy the time we had left together, and she said that she won’t disobey her parents. 

So her goodbye was a BJ and she just left me. She removed our relationship from Facebook without talking to me at all. I got pissed and blocked her on everything. I then felt bad, and I decided to unblock her number. She texted me, and I kinda shut her out again for how she ended things.

I could tell she was upset, so I went to talk to her in person, and she ends up all over me kissing me. I had to push her back, and we agreed to be friends. I felt like she was manipulating me to make herself feel less guilty (she persuaded me to be her friend), and she promised to be my patient in clinic since initially none of my patients were returning my calls. However, without explanation, she backed out. 

I moved out of our old building just before she left, and she texted me saying  it was a shame that she couldn’t say goodbye and that she’d miss me (she knew when I was moving and didn’t bother saying goodbye). I just told her it’s for the best we go our own ways - goodbye. 


I then reblocked her and haven’t talked to her since (it’s been almost 2 months). Her friends and family still follow me on social media, but we don’t interact. 


Since being away from her/being single, I’ve been enjoying my life and can really focus on what I need. I love my new building too — I have more privacy, I’m safer, and I have access to a 24 hr gym. But I can’t help but think about her from time to time — sometimes I miss her companionship, and other times I feel anger towards her for disappointing me too many times, and I’m also upset with myself for taking her crap. She wasn’t very mature or grateful for everything I’ve done for her. She thought coming back to America long term, and I told her I’d support her, and wouldn’t hesitate to buy her plane tickets any time she got homesick and would go with her if I could.

I've been trying to meet someone for a few years now and found dating apps worked best because I could really get to know someone with out even meeting them. You know what I'm talking about.

I just got home from the first date I've been on in so damn long and my god it went so well. We laughed, we shared great conversation and I even got a little kiss at the end of the evening.

We talked for a bit and we really hit it off, especially after learning that we had a lot of things in common, things normally considered somewhat niche. We played a bit of guitar together and by the end of the event, we both had to leave with our different group of friends. She asked for my number and I asked for hers in return. She messaged me later that night and told me that she had a lot of fun with me, and asked that I let her know when I was free so that we could hang out and play together again. We chatted for an hour or so. 

The next day, I asked her out to a place where we could play together. She said that she left town in the morning and that she'd be back in 10 days. Cool, I told her I'd ask her again then. 10 days later, I asked her out again and she said yes to the date/hangout. The day of, she cancelled on me saying that something came up. She followed it up by saying that she'd love to reschedule for tomorrow if I was free and I said I was. Later that night, she cancelled again. Said she was feeling sick. I wished her well and just ended the conversation, but she said we could still meet up next week.

At this point I'd had enough. Cancelling's better than being stood up but yeah, at that point I just wasn't feeling it anymore. She still continues to text me though, almost every day, but I'm not sure about this anymore. 

TL;DR: We met less than a month ago, she asked for my number and initiated conversation. I asked her out multiple times but something always ""came up"" last second.

But with this, turns out she no longer was able to keep the spark going with me since hasn't been able to catch a break from a job she worked previously and that her semester of classes were starting soon. She stated that she wasn't ready, but also said that she may possibly get back to dating after her semester of class is over but is unsure of it. I couldn't really tell if she meant dating other people or with me. Of course, as much as I was saddened, me and her really had great interactions one on one and even had fun phone calls along the way, she really gave me a drive to work harder on my own in my side of personal career. And heck, I was actually hired to a part time job I applied too! I respected her decision and truly understood that some people can't always prioritize everything at once and they needed to focus on important ones for themselves. She however did stated that she still wanted to be friends with me, we can still have phone calls sometimes with each other, and that if Im ever visiting around her area I can come through to see her still. Obviously just without me doing anything beyond which of course I will not do except being platonic. As much as I was okay with that, there are insecurities that I have that comes in and out. One being having the thoughts that she ends up dating someone else, and two with me having the mindset assuming that I still have a chance later on with her becoming wishy washy that she'll come back. Venting to friends, I was reaffirmed with a close friend of hers that she isn't the type to really date around nor even have time to date men and that she's always about being productive to her career. She only dated one person back in H.S but nothing really happened between them, and I was the second and longest one she ever dated with. I was ease with myself after being told that, but people can sometimes change their minds. My insecurities can be in and off sometimes as I tend to overthink a lot. I took a time off not talking to her for a week and then later on decided that I'll be friends. Apparently Im also the very first person she emotionally opened up to about personal issues on her end that she never opened up to her family or even her friends. Which I was tbh honored for that.

In my area, a lot of my non-hood friends act street or hood to get sex from other black women. I don't blame em, because they either do that, or have the situation I have.

 If I'm anything other than hood, I'm pretty much invisible to most other black women.(atleast this is what it feels like) I really dislike this dynamic. 

I've been searching for a black girl that doesn't subscribe herself to this, but I've only met 1, as I'm in my late teens. For other groups, I'm more accepted, for not being a hood type guy. I'm definitely not waiting until I'm older for some to get past ""the bad boy stage"" either.


I refuse to put on a facade of acting hood for sex.  Here's why.

1. It's not a genuine image of how I feel/think about myself.

2. My family won't allow me to because I was raised to be a classic man.(principled, and prideful of intelligence)

I told her multiple times that i feel like she is not interested in me and kinda wants me for those stuff. One other reason is that whenever i try to initiate something sexual like kissing or  touching she always pushes me away or kisses me with hesitation and we have never gone past making out after 2 months eventho we have slept in my house on my bed 3 times already but i never pushed anything cause that's just fuxked up and against everything I believe . She told me the reason she doesn't hang out is she can't study with other people in the same place but i saw her multiple times studying with her friends. I have communicated with her about all these and she always say i knew u before school so im not using u for math or stuff like that, but i feel like she is not the girl i want.
