I‚Äôm 27 and haven‚Äôt had a lot of long term dating experience. I haven‚Äôt come across many people I would want to fully commit to (I.e pursue marriage) in a while and I‚Äôm getting desperate to get some long term relationship experience under my belt. I‚Äôm conflicted though: I have some potential partners I could date but I‚Äôd be going in with the intention of just seeing how it goes and probably ending it after a year because I just wanted the dating experience. This doesn‚Äôt seem fair to them as it seems like I‚Äôm kinda leading them on for potentially something very serious like marriage but I‚Äôm reality I‚Äôm just using them to have a better dating resume. 

I feel like a lot of people in high school and uni just date for the fun of it to see where things go so I don‚Äôt feel too guilty of doing my strategy but I guys it depends on my potential partners age hey?

4,rcx0hs,1639100834,What does she mean?,"So my ex and I are in contact and when I told her I will call her I asked her to reschedule to the next day because I was too tired from the Jewish holidays. 2 years ago when we wanted to get back together I told her that I want to give us another chance but then backed off and said it is not a good idea. Before that I said I will call her but then did not call. So I have been unreliable before. She then texted me that she feels unimportant like 2 years ago when I did the same and I sad I want to talk to her but I actually moved houses and was dehydrated. She said that I am lying and blocked me. A week later she apologised for being so rude to me and I told her that we can get on the phone. This time I really called her and we talked for a while. When we were on the phone I told her that she is everything I ever wanted in a woman and that it was nice talking to her but that the religon is in between us since she is not Jewish and that we can see what will happen in the future when she converted. I told her that I dont want her to convert for me because she felt overwhelmed in my community so that makes me feel insecure that she does not really want to do it for herself. She is fine the way she is so why should she change for a man.

We have been on the phone for 2-3 afterwards and actually talked a bit about the torah etc. and I noticed she has been studying a lot and I told her that I want to see her again and hope she feels the same about me. She said yes, but we should take it slowly and I agreed. Then 2 days later she suddenly texted that it is best to not be in contact because she feels that I am not ready to overcome the obstacles we had and invest in what it needs in order to make it work this time. She wants real commitment and not something in between and said that I should be with a Jewish woman. Then she deleted my contact, deleted me as a friend on Facebook and Instagram and I blocked her afterwards.

I blocked her because it has been an up and down between the two of us. She left me alone when I had a mental health crisis (paranoid behaviour), then she moved countries to start med school and quit med school and I did not want to support her because 6 years is too long to wait for her to finished, then she moved back to the USA and now lives in a different country again which is a bit unstable to me. She broke up with me like 3 times. She always came running back to me. The second time we got back together I cheated on her (talking/texting with other women). I really really loved her the first time we got to know each other. I really did. But now it seems like there are too many obstacles.

Am I immature for blocking her and what does she mean?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rcx0hs/what_does_she_mean/

Then, after time has passed, they come back around wanting attention. Advice in the comments is usually to avoid the person who came back around.

I‚Äôm in a reversed situation. A guy and I went on a couple of dates. The chemistry was good, but confusing, and I wasn‚Äôt quite sure about him. I was also seeing another person who assaulted me, and I just needed a break in general.

I told the guy with confusing chemistry that I didn‚Äôt think he and I would be a good match and wished him well. He was kind and said the same to me.

Fast forward about 2 months later, and I was in a different headspace. I had started dating again, but none of those were a great fit. Then the ‚Äúconfusing chemistry‚Äù guy texts me out of nowhere to ask how I am doing.

We had a nice chat and I asked him if he wanted to go on a date. He said yes. It was a nice date.

Same confusing chemistry. He‚Äôs nice, but there are a couple of things that don‚Äôt click. I‚Äôve decided that I want to give it a little time to see if the confusion clears up.

1. I live in a place without a lotta young desis, so was glad to match with one in my city on Bumble. Went on a date. She had no personality. Super dry conversation. Mostly her talking about med school and her interviews and all. I didn't care if she didn't ask anything back about me that day; felt like she was stressed and wanted to vent it out. Didn't want to judge based on just one short date and tried to set up a second one. She ghosted me lol
2. Matched with a girl in another state on DilMil. Super cool, had all the same interests as me, solid fun conversations everyday for 3 weeks. After that, tried to do a phone or video date, but she flaked thrice. Also, kept giving excuses for meeting up in person. But keeps texting me all the time, responds really fast and has a legit conversation with thoughtful questions. Her excuse for not being able to talk on the phone is that she's too busy with work, but keeps texting me non stop. I don't wanna be all confrontational. Don't need no drama in life.

12,rcxzwm,1639103823,Lost touch with bumble match a month ago and I‚Äôm not sure what to do now,"Met a dude on bumble and we had a lot in common. Our careers, our values, our political stances, we are even practically neighbors. 

We met once and had a great time, but he always took forever to answer my texts. He did say that he sucks at texting and asked to meet again. We met once more and had a great time, but then he never texted and neither did I. That was a month ago. 

I‚Äôve met other people since, but they are very different from me and I don‚Äôt see it going anywhere with them. Going out with them made me think about him and wondering what happened. 

Here are the facts:

- we went walking both times. We met during the day the first time and it made sense. The second time, however, was a cold night and we could‚Äôve gone for a drink but we didn‚Äôt (he suggested walking). 

- the second time we met I had just gotten back from a run. I was about 10-15min late and I did apologize for it. I was also a bit tired, so I was probably a less delightful company than my normal self. 

- he never made a move on me. In fact, we never discussed what we were looking for or said anything about relationships. That may be a bad thing, but it might also be a good thing because we were so busy talking about everything we have in common. 

- he walked me to my apartment both times and I never asked him to come hang out. 

- the second time, he asked me what I was doing that weekend and I said a bunch of half-baked sentences because I was so tired. This makes me think he probably thinks I was trying to fake having a plan to get out of hanging out with him. 

- I‚Äôve recently learned that I don‚Äôt properly communicate when I‚Äôm interested in someone. People I genuinely like told me they thought I was uninterested. 

- bumble still shows his distance from me. Does that mean that he‚Äôs still swiping? 

Now. Guys, gals, non-binary pals, what‚Äôs your advice? Based on the facts, do you think he‚Äôs simply not interested? Should I just move on or should I send him a text?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rcxzwm/lost_touch_with_bumble_match_a_month_ago_and_im/

19,rcyegh,1639105085,Already feeling concerned about intimacy,"I (30F) met a guy on dating apps (28M). We hit it off, I feel comfortable talking to him, we agree on several fundamental issues, and I have slowly begun developing feelings for him. We texted for two weeks before meeting, kissed on the 3rd date, slept together on the 5th. In total it‚Äôs almost been two months. There have been three dates where we have slept together. However, he has expressed that he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want everything to be about sex‚Äù two days out of the three we‚Äôve slept together. When we have slept together, it was fun, intimate and passionate. I personally have not dated or slept with anyone in years. I‚Äôm exceptionally picky and felt lucky to find a guy like him in this crazy dating world. 

He‚Äôs implied that this has something to do with previous relationships. On our last date he dropped me off at my place. We were mid conversation about a different topic but he parked, and immediately stated, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not coming in tonight. I don‚Äôt want you to think that I‚Äôm going to have sex with you after every date.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt even have a chance to invite him in before he rejected me. 

I left feeling really conflicted. On one hand, what woman wants a man who‚Äôs obsessed with sex and pressures their partner all the time? On the other, I felt insulted for several reasons. One, that he feels I‚Äôm incapable of being in a private setting without trying to seduce him, another, that sex is all I want. We spend hours together doing various activities talking, getting to know each other and finding common interests. For me, sex is deeply personal and intimate. Why limit something that is fun? If it feels right why do we have to be mindful of how often we‚Äôre having it? To me a relationship purely about sex happens when people are only hooking up and nothing else. Late night booty calls, no sleeping over, no spending quality time together sharing personal information. We aren‚Äôt doing that. But he made me feel like some psycho nymphomaniac.

We aren‚Äôt even in an official relationship and now I feel insecure about initiating any sort of intimacy in fear that it‚Äôs going to be too much for him. Am I grotesquely overthinking this and should enjoy a man who is seeking something deeper than sex?

Quick question here, i would like to know if something like this has ever work for any of you.
Have you ever asked a girl out but didn't '' built up '' to it beforehand? 

I ask this because i am in a situation where i feel like something like this could work. 

Usually regarding dating i'm a pretty slow guy, i like to get to know the person before asking her out. But here i am on a university campus and there's this girl that i always found cute but we didn't talk or spend much time together (and we still don't actually). But last Friday we were at a party together and we talked a bit and i felt like maybe she was waiting for me to make a move but like i'm not sure... Around all that i learned that she recently got dumped and it was a bit difficult for her. 

My thought was that maybe she wants a rebound guy and i am totally down to be that guy, but i am not emotionally invested enough to text her and put in the effort to get to know her better... 
So i am wandering if maybe i should just out of nowhere ask her out and see where it goes? 


What do you think people i'll be very interessed in having your opinions on that matter. Because I feel like i always put to much efforts in my relationships and i have difficulties to just live in the moment and enjoy certain situations regardless of the consequences!

The flirting was going on and off. The night ended with an   awkward hug.   I texted him the next day saying that I   enjoyed the   time getting to  know him and to go out again sometime. He replied back by saying ""I  enjoyed getting time to know you, although for full   transparency I feel  like I have more of a friend connection with you than a relationship. I  don't want to be grey about anything but yeah if  you'd like to hang out  as friends let me know"".   What does this really mean? Some men write this expecting to just move on while other really mean it. I felt like he liked me but he was just bad  at flirting and so was I. I want to see him again and get to know him more as a friend and see if there will be more to it. One date was not enough. He wants a relationship and so do I, but that takes time after knowing someone.

We have met once years ago but I was in a relationship so I didnt pay him any mind. I have been single for 4 yrs now and trying to put myself out there. We already had sex and we go on dates/spend nights with eachother. On our first date he said he feels we would be really good friends who occasionally have sex when i first asked what are we. Now he says he feels at home with me and that I bring him peace. I asked if he felt like this before and he said its been a while and his last relationship didnt make him feel at ease and he was treated poorly. He has been texting me more and ft me. Since he never experienced being alone/single I have been on guard to protect my heart. I have been alone for a few years so this is all new to me again. I dont know if i should just allow myself to feel how I do or if I should continue to hide how I truly feel.

we did text pretty regularly because of a group project and i was always nice/friendly. i thought we got along pretty well too. i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm particularly unattractive either.

I know this is an emotional thing - I tend to get very emotionally invested in these guys potential, ignoring the fact they're doing nothing with it. Even passing up opportunities to date men more in my league for these guys who are projects. It's, really not a good thing to be doing and I am trying to break the habit.

Now it's impossible. Idk if the guys who prefer to hit and quit just got better at acting like they care so they can smash, or if I'm truly that blind. For context, I am 28y.o., 5 ft 5, 120 lbs, 36DD, medium brown skin, and medium length curly hair. I have a lyrical voice, one of the best head games out there, and no one had ever complained of my tightness or flexibility. As Cardi B would put it, the punani is dasani.

I have PTSD and bad anxiety that I'm continually working on, but it gets triggered when I get ghosted, which has happened by every guy I went out with this year, even if I didn't sleep with them, even when I obliged then and tried their fetishes. 

I'm a pretty open minded individual. It's really hard to piss me off unless you really want to, and I am a good listener with top tier communication and conflict resolution skills. I'm not perfect, but I like myself. I have fun and I want to have fun with someone. Every guy has said ""all the right things"" and then turned out to be a fuckboi. I tread with caution and still get dumped.

Like he would call me and we would talk for hours and hours through the night until we were both too tired and fell asleep. He came over the other night and we had sex for 3 times in 4 hours. He blew out my back. I got even more attached. 

The next day, he isn't texting as much and he hasn't called me, and I'm pretty sure he is backing out of a date we had planned.

I can understand if he's just tired but he's woken up in the middle of the night before just to call me back when he missed my call. I am aware hindsight is 2020, so I don't need people to tell me I should have waited before getting intimate. We were already intimate conversationally.

I dont mean that you need to buy her everything, text her everyday etc. Just keep things casual, dont show women TOO much interest or else they will feel creeped out and just be nice. Respect her boundaries, show interest when she's trying to show you something.
You ask her out, she says ok, few days later she says she cant go because some shit happened who cares. Dont stress but also DONT try to set up another date already. It sounds needy. Instead, tell her that its fine, and to hit you up if she ever wants to go out some other time. This will make her feel like you arent desesperate, and if she really wants to go out with you, she will set a date.
Do not crack jokes which can be offensive before you and her are VERY confortable with each other. Jokes about racism, politics, body image, religion, you get it right? On the first dates you must be very careful not to offend her in anyway, she's just getting to know you and will have no issues leaving you if she feels unconfortable.
Dont force yourself to pay the bill... if you take her out, offer to pay, but if she insists on paying her meal, dont try to change her mind. Let her do it. Some women dont like when men force them to accept it. It can be seen as bossy, as if you are her owner. Some of them dont like it aswell because some men use it later to demand things, such as a kiss or a sexual favour for paying dinner...

45,rd32am,1639120527,Should I break up with him?,"I‚Äôve been dating this guy for almost 5 years now. We broke up 2 years ago and got back together after 10 months. Our relationship before the breakup was toxic, I must admit. In the first 2 years of our relationship he was really caring and kind to me, but after that it kind of went problematic. Whenever I bring up something that bothers me (jealousy, communication, time), he brushes it off, we fight, he gets mad, I apologize. I‚Äôd like to add that whenever we‚Äôre not in good terms and he knows it‚Äôs his fault, he never apologizes to me in person, only through chat. One of the reasons why we broke up is because of time and that I felt he was becoming distant. When I asked him if maybe we could bond more and spend a little more time together, he wasn‚Äôt having it. He got pissed at me, I apologized, we fought, then he broke up with me. (No, he didn‚Äôt have a side chick nor did he cheat on me) Few days and weeks after the breakup I tried patching things up, but all he could say was ‚ÄúSorry‚Äù. And so I gave up from trying to get us back together. 

Like I said, we got back together. He apologized and promised not to cause me pain again. He tried to pursue me for 2 months, of course I gave in. I could say that right now, he‚Äôs really trying his best to change for the better. Whenever we get a misunderstanding, he pauses, apologizes to me, and tries to reflect on what wrong he did. He‚Äôd ask me what should he avoid doing, or what I expect more of him to do. He was really trying. And up until now, he still is. The problem right now is I can‚Äôt move on from his past mistakes. I‚Äôd always get flashbacks to when he got mad at me when I got jealous, or that time when he told me I was being too sensitive, that time when he blamed me for his mistakes, everything. I can see he‚Äôs trying, but I just can‚Äôt seem to move on from the past pain I went through. We‚Äôve talked about it multiple times and he has apologized for the past mistakes that he did, I forgave him but I couldn‚Äôt really forget all the pain I went through.

I love him so much, I really do. I just find it really difficult to move on from the past. He‚Äôs trying his best to be better, and I‚Äôm trying my best too. But recently we‚Äôve been fighting about the things that we‚Äôd already talked about. I told him not to do this, because it triggers me, then he does it but it‚Äôs not really on purpose. He apologizes and tries to make it up to me. And now we just had a misunderstanding, he did apologize, but it‚Äôs getting tiring now. I‚Äôm thinking whether I should breakup with him or give our relationship another chance. What do you think?

46,rd37tg,1639121119,I miss talking to him and have no way to contact him and it makes me really sad,"So some basic background. I (22F) started talking to this guy on Tinder back in late 2018. We never met up irl, but we were really hitting it off and kept meaning to go on a real date, it just never happened. A few months into our little pen-pal type relationship, he was deployed suddenly to another country. I lost contact with him and didn‚Äôt know what happened for months, until he was back in town for a week or so and I found him again on Tinder.

We started talking again, with his new number for the country he was in, and it was nice bc it was flirty but we would also still discuss our dating lives outside of each other being as we were on separate continents and knew nothing could happen at least at the moment.

December of 2019 he told me he was going to be back in town in a few months, and asked me ‚Äúwhat would happen‚Äù if we met up. At the time I was really fragile recovering from being sexually assaulted earlier that year, and I panicked and believed he was only implying we would sleep together if we met up. I flipped out on him and he of course got defensive, and we stopped talking.

Sometime last year I was trying to work on getting closure or apologizing with people from the past. I decided to text him apologizing for how I flipped out, and I explained briefly my situation. He said he didn‚Äôt even remember I had acted that way, and we started talking again for a little bit. He told me he was being sent to a different country soon, and we again lost contact. 

I‚Äôve been struggling a lot with dating (as usual with me) and tonight he suddenly just popped in my mind. And god I‚Äôm really sad that we lost contact, and I have no way of contacting him again. I only have his number from the original country he was deployed in, I lost his US number.

54,rd48z7,1639125497,Am I (35m) getting ghosted by (31F) or does she really just need space after being overwhelmed (VERY long)?,"Hi all,  


I'll try to keep it brief... but I'll probably fail.  
I matched with a girl on a dating App over a month ago..  
I sent her one message, she replied and then so did I. Then nothing.  


So a few days later I sent her a swing for the fence message of ‚Äúdo you want to meet?‚Äù. Surprisingly  replied saying she didn't know a lot about me but wanted to swap numbers to chat.  


We seemed to hit it off, over WhatsApp, quite quickly. We sent probably 100s of messages to each other every day. She's also sent me lots of videos of her dog Monty, or her parents house or her mum with her dog.  
So after about a 1.5 weeks we arranged to meet for a meal. I sent her a message in the morning to check we were still meeting later and if not giving her an easy out if not. She didn't reply (although she had to the message 10 minutes before that one).  
About 2 hours before we were meant to meet I asked her again and she said that she'd thought she'd replied, that she'd had a difficult day in work and wanted to rearrange.  


I gotta be honest I was frustrated and annoyed, but I lied and said I understood. I'd actually put down a ¬£10 deposit for the table (granted she didn't know about that) and generally this felt like very late notice and so it all kinda sounded like bullshit due to the time delay.   
But the biggest frustration, by far, was that I didn't get to spend time with her as she had come across as really lovely women with very similar interests. She's also gorgeous and very funny, but I'm most attracted to her personality/brain more.  
Nb. In her defence I literally did the same thing to an old work colleague the other day i.e. thought I'd replied, but hadn't. You live and you learn.  


We sent a few messages to each other later in the evening. She explained that she was struggling to get her washing machine fixed and then her dog had tore up a cushion. I did express concern, but equally she seemed to be dancing around rearranging the date.   
So the next morning I sent her a bit of a shitty message (not my finest hour) basically explaining how I felt and did she want to rearrange or not?  


She, understandably, sent me a shitty message back explaining her side, and saying that today she'd additionally had an argument with her boss in work and had been sent home. She basically, and correctly, said I hadn't shown much empathy with her situation and just focussed on rearranging the date.  
I sent her a message back saying that I was emotionally vulnerable and didn't deal with it very well, that I apologise unreservedly for my lack of empathy and that I should've done much better. Also, if I in any way contributed to her argument with her management that I was really sorry.  


She said that it deserved a response, but was too busy right now. But she replied the next day.  
She then opened up to me (a lot) about her work situation and then we gradually moved on to messaging each other like before. The videos of her dog resumed too. He's a cutie.  


Then one Friday a week ago we were talking and she said she'd scratched her chin on a Christmas box.   
I said I'm sure it's not as bad as you fear, but I think she was concerned by how she'd look when we eventually met as we'd already agreed to do so (she did say later on, prior to us meeting say: ‚ÄúI hope I'm not a catfish‚Äù.). Cue complete radio silence.  
I sent her a message Saturday afternoon simply asking if she'd received my message? From my perspective it was really weird to go from hundreds of messages a day to none so quickly. No reply.  
Sunday night I asked if she was ok and if I should be concerned? She replied saying that she'd had ‚Äúa blip‚Äù and was staying with her parents (who live quite close. She lives alone).  


I didn't pry for further information, I said it was fine (it very much was this time), that I was glad she was ok and we continued to chat like before.  


We finally arranged to meet for cocktails last Friday. Her response to us meeting was: ‚ÄúYes please‚Äù.  
We live in the same place so she asked what train I was catching into the city nearby so we could get the same one.  
The evening went really well (even though she openly admitted to being nervous). We talked as easily as when we messaged. About the big, small and inconsequential stuff.  
Even though she said she had to go home early to her young dog, who goes a bit crazy in her absence, we still had 7 cocktails each (she led the way, even thought she'd previously said she wasn't a big drinker) and spoke pretty no stop for 3.5 hours. She said stuff like ‚Äúmy parents should adopt you‚Äù, that they hoped I wasn't a Torrie (I'm not), she asked to see photos of my nephew, she let me touch her hair to understand the texture and hold her foot to look at her boot. We laughed at each other and together. She talked to me about her friend's partners/husbands, which ones she liked and why.  
She did also mention that her friends thought that it was odd that at my age (35) I didn't have any kids or never been married, which I haven't.  


Anyway, she said she had to get home but asked me if I wanted to go get some takeaway food? I paid for us both and she said: ‚ÄúWe're going there already are we?‚Äù. We also shared a taxi home and while we waited she said, while eating her chicken, ‚ÄúOne for the wank bank?‚Äù as I was watching her eat because I was holding her drink and the rest of her food, so couldn't eat my own.  
Prior to catching the taxi, but a while after she'd finished eating, I asked if I could kiss her and she said ‚ÄúI'm not there yet‚Äù, but said I could kiss her on the cheek instead. Early, during drinks she didn't want to share her drink as she's a germaphobe so it all seemed to make sense (maybe even kissing her on the cheek was a big step?).  


I got dropped off first, understandably so, even though I live further away (even though she's sent my a photo of her house number and also told me her estate). Her last few words were something like ‚ÄúI'll send you videos of Monty and let's speak soon‚Äù.  


The next morning (Saturday) I sent her a message: I had a great time with you last night. I hope that we can do something again soon?  
Radio silence again.  


I sent her a long message Sunday afternoon, whereby I definitely over shared, but essentially asking her to let me know where she stands? Yes, her lack of response probably tells me already, but she'd also previously gone radio silent in the past and eventually got back to me.... but in a shorter timeframe.  
Still no reply.  


I sent another a brief message Sunday night just asking for her to tell me so was ok as the last time I'd heard from her she was in a random taxi. She replied back saying: ‚ÄúSorry, I'm ok. Just a bit overwhelmed‚Äù.  


I backed off.  
I did send her another brief message Monday night apologising for oversharing and probably making her uncomfortable.  
She replied: I just need to take time to read it all over fully.  


It's now Friday morning and I've not heard from her. To clarify I've not messaged her since Monday.  
That's fine (again truthfully) she can take as long as she needs, but I'll be honest (I am that, probably sometimes to my detriment) and say that it's not a happy place to currently be in.   
I wonder whether with her work problems (she's still not gone back to work), her family troubles (her uncle died 2 months ago), her germaphobia, mixed with the ongoing pandemic, that she's just overloaded and I'm not helping?  


Additionally, due to her problems, I was paying her a lot of compliments to hopefully make her feel better. I do think she is beautiful, but maybe I freaked her out by how much I did it? She has in the past had men who came on too strong (obviously I'm now guilty of this too :( )  
Also, she said that she had been nice to guys in the past and it's got her in trouble because they thinking she's flirting. Could that be this situation too? It certainly seems like flirting based on the the quotes I've shared above? But maybe, since meeting in person, she's had a change of heart?  


The obvious answer is if she wants to get back in touch, she will, but it's the waiting that hurts.  
I have started talking to other women and arranging dates with them, I'm exercising more to clear my head (doesn't really work), but this girl seems to have crawled into my brain and won't leave.  


Yeah, it's all very, very early days, she doesn't owe me an explanation (I agree), but I feel I do deserve a response about meeting again after speaking for so long. I was brave to ask so surely it's not to much for her to be brave in answering? If I get an answer I can move on or not a lot easier.  


Also, yes at some points I've been a dick, but equally she's gone radio silent at some points and that's not ideal either. I think neither of us is coming out of this situation with much glory, maybe other than her being REALY patient with me. Maybe I should do the very same for her in return?I suppose it's the least I could do.  


Thoughts?  
(apologises for the length, but it was good to get it off my chest)

I met this girl about a month ago at a party, and she seemed very interested in me - laughing at all my jokes, asking me questions, and we had an interesting conversation. I knew the girl from before, but not very closely. The next day after the party, I wrote her a message on Facebook, and then we chatted for some time.

She took a long time to respond after almost every chat but this might be for different reasons; she's probably just busy, or maybe she's not that interested after all and I read her wrongly. But towards the end of the chat, I asked her if she would go hiking with me sometime - no specifics, just asked her if she was interested in doing it when the weather was right. She answered something like ""yeah, why not, that would be nice.""

71,rd65o0,1639133680,This made my first dates 100x easier..,"I used to be stuck in my head on first dates. 

Predictably they would always be ""meh"" and she would ghost or flake on me when it came to organising a 2nd.

But after reading The Way Of The Superior Man by David Deida for the 10th time, something finally clicked.

I realized that I wasn't present in my body at all.

My attention was disconnected from myself and anxiously focused on her. Trying to analyze her. Read her. Be approved of by her.

Constant overthinking and not enough feeling.

So I started practicing going on first dates and just paying attention to the energy and sensations of my body.

The subtle signs from my body that say ""yes this person""

Signs such as...

Rising sexual energy from the base of my spine.

The faster beating of my heart when we make eye contact that's a second longer than usual.

The warm, fuzzing sensation in my chest when she laughs.

Weirdly, I realized that most of the women I was going on dates with I wasn't actually attracted to. I just wanted their approval.

My head, with all its insecurities and fears, was in charge. 

Not my body.

So I vowed to stop pursuing women if I didn't feel this body centred attraction. 

I let my body tell me if I truly desired this woman or not and allowed my head to take a backseat.

And honestly this was the catalyst for the biggest change in my dating life.

Over the following 6 months afterwards I experienced...

Tears.
Belly laughs.
Soul piercing eye contact.
Some of the best sex of my life.
Powerful and deep emotional connection.

All on first dates.

I honestly never believed this kind of thing was possible previously.

And most of the time neither did she.

""How is this possible?"" ... one beautiful Chilean woman said as she lay with her head on my chest drawing letters on my skin with her fingers.

Yet there it was.

And it came from something so simple.

Letting my body lead. Letting my mind go.

And being present with both her AND myself.

76,rd7nk9,1639139608,What should i do?,"TL;RD- my bf(m22) and i(f19) are having problems when i try to talk about my problems in life and in the relationship. I‚Äôve been told im toxic and negative while I‚Äôm hitting rockbottom. Also while i was venting, my past relationship and my behaviour in that relationship was brought up. Can‚Äôt help but feel neglected 

I‚Äôll run through what happened in the past 2 days. Yesterday my long distance BF and I were watching a tv show together, and maybe because of some network glitch the screen went off and he left. I get a text that says, ‚ÄòI‚Äôll be back in 10‚Äô. He didn‚Äôt tell me where he‚Äôs going and for what and I didn‚Äôt pay much attention to it and instead i started watching the some other show. He came back in 10mins, and he came back while i was watching the tv show and warming up my food as it was dinner time. I asked him where he went, he told me he went to smoke. And i was like what? Not that I didn‚Äôt hear him but i was like you just leave like this? That too for a smoke. Yes i do have problems with him smoking, i too smoke but very occasionally. I tell him smoke once in a while not everyday that too 5 cigs a day! And he‚Äôll tell me to look at his friends who smoke almost or maybe more than a pack a day. I was stunned last night like how can you just go like this and not say anything? I called him twice during the time he left but he didn‚Äôt pick up neither did he say what he was doing. I kinda got a bit angry on him and told him why would he go for a smoke so abruptly? That too without even telling me anything? Because this has happened before that he‚Äôs gone for a smoke with his friends and he‚Äôll tell me he‚Äôll smoke and come and I‚Äôll be chilling there. Like that‚Äôs okay but it came as a shock to me because it was all so sudden and i lost it when i kept asking him why would he go like this and not tell me, his response to that was, ‚Äòi told you what i had to, believe me if you want to!‚Äô And that‚Äôs it. I lost it! Firstly because if I‚Äôm asking you something multiple times i deserve an answer and not just being left in the wild. Secondly, I don‚Äôt like the laid back attitude which he knows, like just help me out. Your one sentence isn‚Äôt gonna be believable no matter how many times you chose to tell me! So all that happened and i shouted and he despises that and i get it that he doesn‚Äôt like me shouting at him. But that entire call he kept telling me to calm down and talk with some respect! Yes i agree i let anger get the best of me but all my point is, if i have a problem or a doubt help me out instead of leaving me in the wild to deal with it! That‚Äôs all I expected. 
After that as it was dinner time, i wanted to eat because i was looking forward to my dinner last night and i told him to give me 15mins so that i could eat and it took me way more than 15mins! I took almost 45mins and he slept in that time and I didn‚Äôt update him that it‚Äôll take me longer. He kept telling me why would you do something that you despise off, that‚Äôs hypocrisy. I swear my intention wasn‚Äôt to get back at him but i lost track of time and then my mum asked me to help her around the house. But he told me its my ego and I‚Äôm getting back at him, even if i did the same shit like him he‚Äôs calm and i shouted at him earlier. So he told me he thought about all of this and he wants to take the relationship slow, this slow and casual thing we‚Äôve done multiple times till a point where we shout and breakdown and are on the verge of breaking up and then we‚Äôll decide to work on it. I don‚Äôt want to fall in that loop over and over again! Btw we had a big fight 5-6 days ago a pretty big one tbh and since then i know he‚Äôs changed but last night when he was i feel acting like what he used to do before and i told him he‚Äôs not changed and he‚Äôs just the same narcissistic and egoistic person that he was. He was hurt and i did apologise and i did realise my mistake after a while. But last night we end that fight resolve it and go to sleep and dismiss the ‚Äòtaking it slow part‚Äô 

Last night when we were talking i spoke to him about what i was feeling and how unmotivated i felt, how pathetic i was feeling because i never got any work done, i couldn‚Äôt work on myself for some reason, can‚Äôt focus on school and on myself or anything! Its like right now I‚Äôm in a puddle and I can see no way out. He told me to rest and take like slow and just chill for a while and everything shall fall into place. It was a mellow conversation and i liked it tbh. We ended that call with more of love and less of fight and disagreements and we also spoke about a few problems we had. It was overall good. 

And today, I didn‚Äôt have a best day! I spoke to him about the mess of today and then he was like he‚Äôll go work and he leaves. I was like okay I‚Äôll finish my stuff. But after a while i text him, that I‚Äôm not being completely vulnerable with you because i fear that my problems will be ignored, its roots from a childhood trauma and also because in this relationship I‚Äôve lied to him several times and he‚Äôs lost all trust in me but he still was trying to make it work but he couldn‚Äôt resolve me problems and this went on for like 3 months and none of my problems were resolved. He called me immediately when i told him I‚Äôm not vulnerable with him and maybe he hoped he could talk me through it but i told him i need some time. I go do my stuff for a while, shower and eat and then call him. I call him and he says i called him for 5 seconds honestly I don‚Äôt even remember if it was 5 or 10. He text me before i called him how i was feeling and i thought I‚Äôll talk to him on call. He didn‚Äôt pick because he was cooking. But i think while he was doing that he was texting me all i told him instead of texting me emojis could you not have called? He told me to stop nitpick everything he does and not get annoyed for everything. All I expected was a call back since at this point reaching out to anyone is a big thing for me and he‚Äôs been in my shoes and i expect him to understand where i come from. I asked him what was your moto behind telling me to that I called for 5secs? He told me I‚Äôm being very negative and toxic and he doesn‚Äôt want this in his life as he wants to focus on his career. I do get that, I‚Äôve started offline school after almost 2 years and its a lot for me too and i too wanna focus on it!  But I don‚Äôt see me doing anything about it instead of being in a constant low energy and low motivation phase. Even today he told me he wants to take this slow. I feel I‚Äôm in a middle of a breakdown. And if he is expecting me to be calm and talk to me then I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm so strong to control my emotions and talk? I don‚Äôt and I can‚Äôt trust me! I for once want some to just be there so i can talk my head out and be done with it and not keep this all to myself! Right now he‚Äôs ghosting me because im toxic or negative i dont know man! But all i think right now is my fear of not being heard just came back to life and I‚Äôm going back into my shell! 

Update: I couldn‚Äôt talk to him about my problems because i was trying to talk to him about what happened earlier today. I lost what my problem was, but as soon as i could pick something up about what i want, he brought up the fuck up i said in the previous conversation (the one that happened earlier today) and he brought my past relationship up started saying weren‚Äôt you like this in your past relationship? That too when I‚Äôm trying to talk to him about my problems! I can‚Äôt help but feel he‚Äôs neglecting me. What am i doing wrong? Do i not deserve some time where i can just vent and not be told about what i did wrong?

Everytime I start care about girl she reject me or disapointed me in some way - that I lost interest in long term relationship with her. All I can do is realtionships without feelings just FWB or ONS. I just feel like I can't care about girl, because if she saw Im care - she will reject me - which is very painfull to me - especially from girls Im really into. Last time it's happened again. She saw Im care and she lost interest.  I'm already bored and pissed off of this. It is rare to find someone with whom there is chemistry. Most of the time, there's no chemistry, and I don't even feel it. When the chemo appears - the girl either runs away or it turns out that she is cheating on her boyfriend with me.

I‚Äôm high af emotional and just woke up so my grammar will not be on point &amp;‚Äô it may seem a bit disorganized but bear with me.
First let me say I‚Äôm in love y‚Äôall, like deeply in love. I‚Äôve loved before &amp;‚Äô thought I‚Äôve been in love before but never like this at all. 
We‚Äôve been in what ever this situation were in is called for a few years now things were good but recently things have changed our intimacy is low &amp;‚Äô sex is basically out the question. I‚Äôve also been noticing more signs that she‚Äôs probably feeling someone else which shouldn‚Äôt be a problem because we‚Äôre not really together but it is. I‚Äôve tried talking to her about things a few times even tried to end things all together twice but that obviously didn‚Äôt work either. She doesn‚Äôt want a relationship right now but also wants a need me in her life (her words). I do want a relationship &amp;‚Äô feel the same about wanting her in my life but this friend position really just been breaking me down slowly. 
When I think of her she‚Äôs everything I look for in a partner with the looks to match when things were going well I felt like the richest man on the planet. 
We always have each other back there is no tit for tat she actually feel I do more for her than she do for me, I feel like she dose plenty already. We have deep insightful conversation even on bad days just seeing her n hanging out makes me forget anything was ever wrong I truly feel she is my life partner but I also believe a relationship between us just is not in the cards for me.
Idk what to do my natural instinct is to just end it get over her &amp;‚Äô move on but knowing she doesn‚Äôt want to lose me as a friend &amp;‚Äô hearing how she feels about me makes me not want to just abandon her. I feel selfish.

91,rdbi4a,1639151246,"Men‚Äôs advice. He‚Äôs handsome, in shape, has a good job, but women in his life don‚Äôt stick around. Trying to be a ‚Äòcatch‚Äô is a Nice Guy mentality that never works long-term","You see it all the time. Guys list off their attractive qualities like a resume:

They‚Äôre tall, they work out, they make a six figure salary, they say all of their female friends wonder why they‚Äôre still single, etc. They wonder the same thing themselves. They don‚Äôt have trouble meeting women, but none of them want to stick around, and they‚Äôre often befuddled by this.

It‚Äôs because attraction isn‚Äôt based solely on having superficial qualities based on what society are desirable. Attraction is not a checklist, nor is it a points based system.

The Nice Guy believes that if he buys a woman a nice dinner, opens doors, treats her a certain way, that in return she will fall for him. False.

The same concept applies here. If you are boring, too available, too nice, you don‚Äôt have your own hobbies, you are too formal, having superficial attractive qualities will only sustain you for so long.

For instance, if you have a large circle of single female friends who tell you what a catch you are, but none of them want to date you themselves, then that is in indication that you are too subscribed to the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a catch mentality‚Äù. Here are some things to keep in mind:

There is a difference in believing you are a catch on a superficial level and that you a prize on a deeper level. When you feel like you‚Äôve marked the checkboxes-good looks, money, etc-this is the false belief of ‚Äúbeing a catch‚Äù you should avoid. That is simply a crutch for your ego. When you truly believe that you‚Äôre a prize, you believe you are interesting, unique, independent, that you offer something that most people can‚Äôt, aside from just looks or money.

You‚Äôre likely too nice/boring. This doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be an asshole, but you likely have a false White Night mentality, that since you‚Äôre this great handsome guy, you have to be overly polite, agreeable, and put the woman in your life on a pedestal.

You might be getting false feedback, or have a false self-perception of your looks. You might not be as physically attractive as you think you are. Sometimes when people encounter rejection, they inflate their self image as a defense mechanism. You have to take an honest look at yourself and your deficiencies, and work to develop those areas.

You are too available. This doesn‚Äôt mean you should be deceptive and withdraw yourself, but if you are a dynamic person, you should be busy and not readily available at the drop of a hat. If you are being active, working on your career or passion, maintaining your other personal relationships, your time will be limited. It is a turnoff for men and women alike If they person they‚Äôre seeing is willing to drop what they‚Äôre doing at the drop of a hat every single time to see them. A little bit of mystery and limited access is attractive.

Be interesting, be ballsy, be independent, be busy. Have some whimsy and some edge. Don‚Äôt assume that a woman should be happy to be with you just because of a few superficial qualities‚Äîyou have to have depth.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rdbi4a/mens_advice_hes_handsome_in_shape_has_a_good_job/
