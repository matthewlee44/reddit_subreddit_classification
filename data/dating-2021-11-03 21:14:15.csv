Twice he stopped in front of my desk like if he's going to tell me more but doesn't, he just pauses looks at me and keeps going.  Problem is, I didn't get his name and I dont think he got mine.  I was going to ask his name the following Monday and see if anything progressed from there but i found out he was only going to be at my work for a few weeks and I lost my chance.  Someone else from his department is now at my work,  I found out his name and I think I found him on FB. Is it weird that I contact him randomly?

1,qmaheh,1635992147,Ex texted me cryptically from a friend’s number…what to do?,"My (25M) ex (22F) left me almost 2 years ago now. It was a horrible breakup filled with lies and character destruction on her part. She wasn’t raised how I was and so she did a lot of hurtful things to say the least. Still, for a while, she tried to make me feel like I was the bad person, so I tried hard to work on it and actually save a friendship because I always truly cared about her and her family, and was tricked into thinking I had let her down somehow.

We didn’t have any contact since spring of this year because she kept telling people false things about me every chance she got. Pure character assassination. She tried to slander me to my coworkers, boss, etc. She had been dating another guy since last year but she still kept trying to slander me.

She has my number blocked. But I never blocked hers because I just don’t do that; I don’t have any reason to block people because I prefer to confront and resolve problems; not suppress them. She is actually across the country on an assignment right now. About two weeks ago I got this text from an unknown number:

“There not together anymore I hope your happy with what you did”.

I didn’t reply. I looked up the number on Google and linked it to a name of someone I know is her name friend. I’ve never met the friend personally but I recognize the name and know my ex is in the same geographic location as him right now.

So, I don’t know what to do with this. I’ve ignored it so far but not sure if I should speak to anyone about it. 

1) “There not together anymore”…OK, that must mean her and her bf aren’t together anymore. OK? I really don’t care. She thinks I tried to break them up. I didn’t; I only wanted a friendship peace between her and I and made that clear. 

2) “I hope your happy with what you did”.  Here’s what I did: for months after our breakup, I tried to be a good person and repair everything. When a year went by and she kept defaming my name to as many mutual friends as possible and saying blatantly false things about me, trying to start trouble, I did this: I told her boyfriend, her boyfriend’s parents, and her mother what she was doing. I saved horrible texts and showed all of them what she was doing and saying. Especially her mom, because her mom always liked me and respected me and really didn’t understand what happened. So I showed her what happened after it became out of control and too much to keep enduring. I debated it heavily but the necessity had come to tell the truth. Some mature adults needed to know what she was doing…maybe it’ll help her learn and be a better person.

So, I have to assume something blew up and after all of that came to light, her new bf dumped her and she’s upset. But why would she text me from a friend’s number, or have her friend text me that? (The way it’s worded in 3rd person suggests her friend typed it). Why wouldn’t she just do it from her own number and not hide behind someone else’s? So weird and unnecessary. 

What should I do? I’ve spoken to her mom as recently as last month. Should I completely ignore it, or should I show it to her mom and ask her what the problem is?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qmaheh/ex_texted_me_cryptically_from_a_friends/

She also let me put my arm around her multiple times throughout the night and didn’t flinch away. The comments were overwhelmingly telling me that she likes me so I decided to ask her to dinner, and I did not say it was a date. She said yes to dinner, but said she is not looking for a relationship right now because she just went through a breakup. I made a joke about how I never brought up wanting to date her and that she must have been thinking about it in order to bring it up and we’re still on for dinner this weekend. I am just wondering about why she would flirt with me heavily and then bring up not wanting a relationship after I just ask her out to dinner? Also, why would she still want to get dinner with me even though she rightly suspects that my feelings for her are romantic? How should I act when I get dinner with her?

\-He still talks to me and invites me to come CUDDLE in his room despite me now knowing about her. This was while his girlfriend was in the hospital. I went in his room but refused to touch him and he said I was making a big deal out of nothing.

\-THE NEXT day after I rejected his cuddles his GF was over, sleeping in his bed, and he brought her to his family's wedding.

I am now looking at gorgeous pics of him and his girlfriend at his family wedding. He took HER not me and it is just crippling my self esteem that I am not #1. What should I do?

Would he have liked me better if I just slept with him instead of being whiny/complaining that I felt guilty cuz I was the side chick?

9,qmba4z,1635994800,"Almost 40, Never Dated","I'm genuinely curious; as a man that is almost 40 and has never been in a relationship (or even been on a date), and has been intimate with only 1 woman (more than once, mind you, not just a one-off), what is the likelihood that women around my age would be willing to give me a chance? I mean, I know there likely are women out there that would, but I'm legit curious to know roughly how many there may actually be; not like an approximate number, just a fairly vague generalization. It just seems to me that most women around my age would probably see it as too much effort or a waste of time to try starting a relationship with someone that has no real experience being in one; sort of akin to adopting an 8-year-old dog that was never really trained, socialized or housebroken. You really want to give it a shot, but ultimately you realize it's just too much trouble to go through something that should have already been done by now. (A rough analogy, but I feel the point gets across regardless.) My lack of experience isn't for lack of trying; but when I was younger, I was much more awkward (as most of us are), and it seemed that came across as creepy or weird, so I never really got anywhere, and, as I got older, I started pining after certain women, which really didn't help at all. Now, I'm just over a year shy of being 40, and I can't help but feel that I've missed my opportunity. I know I'm probably overthinking it (as I'm oft to do), but I guess I just need to hear (or rather, in this case, read) it from others to validate and confirm that I'm just worrying needlessly.

18,qmbx49,1635996959,I don't know what he wants....,"So I had a crush on this guy from my college.We are from different classes and he is a senior too. My friends pushed me way too much to talk to him but I had no courage to do it. But I gathered courage and approached him and I got an amazing response from his side.He told me he likes confident girls which I took as a compliment fr.
 We used to talk about college things, music, movies , a little bit about ourselves &amp; flirt sometimes since I told him I liked him in the start and he flirted back too. I had thought of taking it all slow so that I don't look desperate or anything, but he took it all real too fast and asked me for my phone number .Everything was going just great, he even asked me to meet him, He told me not to stand him up(kind of sounded like he had trust issues) I assured him I would come for sure because the more I talked to him the more I fell for him , but he became busy and we didn't meet.
 After sometime I texted him back and asked him to meet me some day in college because I wanted to take it to another step, but all of a sudden he just started replying without no interest and told me he would let me know if he is not busy and meet me in college and then ghosted me for an entire month after that.I also stopped talking because I felt so ridiculous and rejected since I was the one to intitiate conversations and try hard to get replies from him ,my heart broke into pieces that maybe Iam not good enough for him (since he is kinda really cute &amp; handsome). After ghosting me I thought he just doesn't have interest in me and I compelled myself to move on.
 Just when I had almost moved on &amp; stopped thinking about him, I saw him in the college but pretended like I don't know him while he stared at me and then came up with his friends to say hi. I was so nervous I didn't really know what to say plus he was too shy to even talk to me after asking me How I was. His friend kept talking to me and asked some awkward questions like is his friend(my crush) hot or not. I was too nervous so I kept asking the guy some questions about life and he just answered with a one or two liner thats it. He didn't even make any eye contact with me, like totally avoiding eye contacts. Since I didn't really see the conversation going anywhere so I bid farewell but since then I can't stop thinking about him and that why did he come and say Hi to me when he clearly didn't want to meet earlier &amp; ghosted me. Him being really shy in person made me think maybe he is an introvert or maybe he just is a good texter. But Iam really confused and I barely have any clue what to do. My friends think that he is interested in me thats why he did this, came up and talked in person but even after that day I didn't get any texts from him which I think I should get. Maybe he was just guilty of ghosting me or maybe he is playing hard to get because I really put efforts in talking to him an becoming friends since the start. I'd randomly text him, put efforts in the chat, make it interesting and not boring and he also talked and put efforts in asking dfferent questions about me, so I really understand what i did wrong. 
I don't know whether I should confront him now and text him back again (because I have some self respect left duh) or just let it all be. I really don't want to loose him I like this man.

She expressed interest in me each time I saw her and through Instagram dms. We eventually made out at a party and then I stayed over at her place that night but nothing happened as it was late and we were both very drunk. The next morning she was keen but I was too anxious and sick from being hungover to do anything. A few days later I asked if she would like to grab a drink but she declined and said that she thought we were just friends and that she is strictly not looking for anything serious at the moment because she has mental scars from previous relationships.

I interpreted this as a nice way of rejecting me but I was still a bit confused as she has always seemed pretty keen. I decided to distance myself and not initiate contact with her.

The next weekend, she asked me where my friends and I were going and she came to the same bar with her friends. She was very touchy and flirty with me the whole night but then she got way too drunk and had to go home. Over the last 2 weeks, she has kept finding random reasons to message me and start a conversation (I have not initiated any contact). The sober messages are pretty harmless but on 2 different nights out she has messaged me wanting to meet up and watch a movie or have a drink at her place. Unfortunately, both times I was working and unable to meet up with her.

However, this whole situation has really confused me – does she just want to meet up and hang out as friends or does she want sex? I assume the latter as both times she has been out drinking and would be unusual to meet up late at night at her house to hang out as friends, right?

Any advice would be appreciated – I would be happy being friends with benefits as I am attracted to her and we get along well, but I am second guessing everything as she has said she just wants to be friends.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qmbznb/what_to_do_when_she_said_she_just_wants_to_be/

I try my best and we get together when we can but it just seems like my girlfriend is always too tired or spaced out. She doesn’t talk to me as much and answers me in one word sentences. 

I don’t say anything because I know she has a lot on her plate and I accept it, but she even notices she is not being that great and says she wants to do better but keeps doing the same things.

I think since we have been dating for a while she is also more comfortable. But this mix of increased responsibilities and comfortability are really making me feel like I’m not getting enough of her. 

Its not like it’s a complete deal breaker but it can be frustrating. Sometimes when I tend to things that I have to tend to she gets annoyed and will say that I don’t spend enough time with her but then when I do she will just be browsing her phone.

Short version, I hated my previous school and the girls there were boring af, and I saw their dark side already so I wasn't that interested. I thought of her as a friend initially, and I eventually hung out within the same social group as her more and more often. I got her number before I was attracted to her, so there's that. As time went on, I found myself attracted to her more and more, and that all I ever wanted was to talk with her during break and maximize my opportunities.

So as I mentioned, I sit with her during lunch, but not always next to her. She would sometimes invite me to sit next to her, only sometimes though. I assumed she was just being nice. She would sometimes invite me to go with her to get stuff even if there was no reason for me to do so, besides simply going with her. I still take this as her being nice. She invited me to her fellowship club even though she knew very well I was agnostic. (I don't wana emphasize this, but there is no way I will ever be converted to Christianity in any form because of my crazy creationist theories. I have developed over 20 creationist theories with over 50 subtheories. All unique from each other. Some can overlap others, some can't. Anyways.) She started teaching me some of her Christian beliefs, even though I still made it quite clear I won't believe, but it's probably because I showed genuine interest. I was interested in the religion and as to why people are so devoted. I guess she was pretty excited that there was someone else willing to listen to her beliefs on this. All of the friends in the social circle are not Christian except her. I talk to her a lot during break and lunch, and she doesn't seem annoyed by it. There was always a topic to talk about. She would sometimes willingly approach me, though it was usually me that approached her. I assumed all of this as her just bein nice.

I’m defiantly getting the girl flowers, but incase I go to her house, I wonder if it would be appropriate to bring two bouquets, or possibly thinking a potted plant &amp; maybe edible arrangement for my girl. Shes been in such a funk

Tl;dr haven’t met her sister either and she lives in another city. Should I get her something another time? Or bring her something to be given?

It’s been 5 days and I haven’t heard from her—should I text her and say:

1) “it was fun but I didn’t feel a vibe”
2) “let’s grab a drink” (maybe we’d both have a better time)
3) ghost

30,qmcsrd,1636000166,What are your thoughts on my situation?,"I ended up getting ghosting and I reached out 5 days after our last contact.

I wanted to assure her that I was in fact interested due to making some choices that might make her think or feel otherwise.

Because she was ghosting me I assumed she wasn't interested, so I asked why she didn't tell me how she felt when there were two different occasions that she had a chance too and said that I wish she had then.  The first occasion was the morning she left my place after staying the night and the second was a phone call we had a couple days after that. Heck, she even said she missed on the phone call.

I ended the message saying that I hope to hear from her and if not, I understand.

She got back to me less than an hour later and apologized for not getting back to me because her mental health has been bad for the last week and she feels like a bother to people and tends to just shut down. 

She also said she enjoyed our last date and that she would want to see me again if I was up for it.

I reached out the next day saying I understand how it can be hard and that I would like to see her again.  She did not reply to that message.

I messaged her 3 days later with some possible plans for a date if she was free and I received no response after and it's been 2 days so far.


My concern is that I stated I wish she would have told me how she felt about on either of the two occasions in the case she wasn't interested, so when I reached out after being ghosted that the next best time for her to say she wasn't interested would have been then. 

I also stated that if I didn't hear from her I would understand, which would have given her the choice to just ignore me if she wasn't interested.

Not only did I give her a platform to state her disinterested by either telling me or just ignoring me, she chose to get back to me apologize twice, say that she enjoyed our time, and that she would want to see me again. 

So I feel I might be underestimating the toll her mental health has on her or that she truly is uninterested, but too ""nice"" to state how she feels and just hopes I get the message eventually. Even though she said she enjoyed our time and would like to see me again.

This is all throwing me for a loop.

Im kind of a boring person too, it's like yeah maybe I'm starting too look good and look after my appearance (my stomach looks like an empty shopping bag though 😭) but I'm still quite insecure.

Recently I have begun the assessment process for adult autism, and one of the screening questions was for social situations. This made me realize that while I can mask with female friends (and they all know I’m a little different anyways), I’m up a creek when it comes to men. 

I was discussing dating with my therapist and realized I have no modelling of what to do on a date, I have no idea if someone likes me or not, then if they do end up making advances I get really uncomfortable with being touched. 


This is all really new to me, and now I’m recently single so trying to enter the dating world again and realizing that I’m kind of out of my depth here.

48,qmdxtr,1636004675,Move on or try once more?,"Context. Ran into a woman at my apartment that is my type in regards to appearance, humor, and overall personality. Talked a few times until one night we chatted for over an hour and I got her number. Chatted over text a good amount and ran into each other a few times and it was enjoyable. Finally asked her on a date and she agreed, but said she was busy for that day but Sunday would work fine. Problem is Sunday didn't work for me so I let her know and said maybe we could plan something out for the upcoming weekend. 

A long time friend came down for that week for vacation and stayed with me. During this time she agreed to come down and hang out in the pool with us at night. Stayed for around two hours. Due to it being a vacation period I sort of drank like I was back in college with my buddy. This turned into a decently cringe, but pretty innocent, drunk text to her that seemed to slightly put her off. Had two other girls read it and they didn't find it creepy or that bad, but just to give her space and then try again. So that weekend rescheduled date never got brought back up. 

After a period of time went by I started texting her a little again. Keep in mind we ran into each other a few times at the complex and it was always extremely friendly and she didn't seem to have changed at all. She was receptive to my texts and we had conversations, but she rarely initiated at that point. I figured I would give it another shot and invite her to a funny event that only happens once a year in our area. She said she was busy. Keep in mind I only gave her a couple days heads up so I didn't expect much else. She is genuinely busy with athletics, family, work, and friends and she gave me a very valid reason as she was going to another event with a group of friends that weekend. 

So at that point I figured I would move on and just be friendly with her. Ran into her a couple more times and had a few text conversations that were all very friendly, but I was just keeping it that way. There was a few days where we had a decent conversation and it turned into me sending the last message and her reading it the next morning, not responding, then me sending another text about something else at our complex a day later and it was left on delivered for a few days. Keep in mind she initiated the conversation. But during this time I ran into her and she was extremely receptive to talking to me in person and showing me photos and stuff of her halloween event she went to. 

Ran into her today, when she called out to me from behind when I didn't even know she was there,  and mentioned I went to a hockey game monday and she said she was extremely jealous and kind of hinted at not wanting to deal with the hassle (money/drive) of going to a game recently. After some reflection and another decent text conversation tonight I have never gotten a flat out rejection and of the two times I actually asked her out she had genuine reasons for not accepting. Would it be strange if I was straightforward, based off of a coworkers recommendation, and say something like ""Hey, Just want to give it one last shot. A friend/his GF (that she knows and has talked to) have been looking into getting some club level seats at least one time this year for a game. It's going to be in a few weeks and I was wondering if you maybe wanted to join me?"" 

Think it kind of makes it clear I'm not someone who is going to be continually pestering her and I absolutely don't want to do so to someone else. Gives a decent amount of time for her to work it into her schedule if she's interested and it's obviously something she is interested in opposed to a boring dinner date or something. Also, it's been around a month since that last date offer. Think I should just move on or give it one more shot? I just don't want to be in the position of reflecting on this a year from now thinking about how even if there was a 5% chance that I walked away when she was busy twice and ignored me with a single text for a few days, but instantly replied with the next one. 

&amp;#x200B;

So we end up having our first kiss that night, and the night was great. The only thing that I can think of that went wrong was that after we kissed I told him I like spending time with him and he said: “you barely know me” LMAO which really hurt, but I quickly cleared up that I was only trying to say something sweet since we kissed and he seemed to be cool.

We’ve been friends for years and had feelings (he was in love with me for a while before I told him I liked him). Anyways, we’ve been dating and have been through a lot of things but have gotten over them. 


I recently moved and it seems our fights have escalated to how it was when we first started dating. Our fights consisted of sexual issues (lack of libido for him), previous relationships and just constantly asking for romance (he says he’s practical with it whenever I’ve asked for flowers before). We went to therapy and started meds for depression/anxiety but since COVID and my move, it’s been hella hard. 

After moving, it’s been up and down that I’ve contemplated breaking up with him. He gets defensive really quickly, he’s still had difficulty with romance (I’m a romantic) and dread asking him for stuff as he usually responds with a “we’ll see”, which has come to mean No to me. Even when I went to visit and he planned a date, we ended in a fight as he waited last minute to get nice clothes and it was a fancy event. Doesn’t feel fancy being rushed and wearing converse as I can’t find my heels…


Anyways, I recently talked to our mutual friend about how I planned out our week together when he visits, and being told “we’ll see” about certain events planned. I’ve just been feeling disappointed and I’m wondering if this is a breaking point? Tonight he told me in his sleepy state, it be better if we only talk an hour a day VS 3-5 hours we talk. I personally feel we don’t talk too much anymore as he works overtime but whatever. I wanna be petty and give him what he wants, but just not talking to him for a few days to have him see how it feels to “really” not talk. Immature, I know. But I just feel he’s settled and secured even if he never admits it and I’ve told him I’ve thought of ending the relationship. 

Has anyone dealt with this? Any tips? I love him and don’t want to break up. But it’s a scary thought that when I “broke up” with him before, I was a sobbing mess. Now, I’m just like “whatever” mentality.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qmea0q/dialing_back_on_talking/

54,qmekr6,1636007457,Ex texted me cryptically from a friend’s number…what to do?,"My (25M) ex (22F) left me almost 2 years ago now. It was a horrible breakup filled with lies and character destruction on her part. She wasn’t raised how I was and so she did a lot of hurtful things to say the least. Still, for a while, she tried to make me feel like I was the bad person, so I tried hard to work on it and actually save a friendship because I always truly cared about her and her family, and was tricked into thinking I had let her down somehow.

We didn’t have any contact since spring of this year because she kept telling people false things about me every chance she got. Pure character assassination. She tried to slander me to my coworkers, boss, etc. She had been dating another guy since last year but she still kept trying to slander me.

She has my number blocked. But I never blocked hers because I just don’t do that; I don’t have any reason to block people because I prefer to confront and resolve problems; not suppress them. She is actually across the country on an assignment right now. About two weeks ago I got this text from an unknown number:

“There not together anymore I hope your happy with what you did”.

I didn’t reply. I looked up the number on Google and linked it to a name of someone I know is her male friend. I’ve never met the friend personally but I recognize the name and know my ex is in the same geographic location as him right now.

So, I don’t know what to do with this. I’ve ignored it so far but not sure if I should speak to anyone about it. 

1) “There not together anymore”…OK, that must mean her and her bf aren’t together anymore. OK? I really don’t care. She thinks I tried to break them up. I didn’t; I only wanted a friendship peace between her and I and made that clear. 

2) “I hope your happy with what you did”.  Here’s what I did: for months after our breakup, I tried to be a good person and repair everything. When a year went by and she kept defaming my name to as many mutual friends as possible and saying blatantly false things about me, trying to start trouble, I did this: I told her boyfriend, her boyfriend’s parents, and her mother what she was doing. I saved horrible texts and showed all of them what she was doing and saying. Especially her mom, because her mom always liked me and respected me and really didn’t understand what happened. So I showed her what happened after it became out of control and too much to keep enduring. I debated it heavily but the necessity had come to tell the truth. Not to ruin any relationship of hers, but to put an end to what she was doing so that she could be a better person and have better relationships with people. I care like that and want people to be their best. Some mature adults needed to know what she was doing…maybe it’ll help her learn and be a better person.

So, I have to assume something blew up and after all of that came to light, her new bf dumped her and she’s upset. But why would she text me from a friend’s number, or have her friend text me that? (The way it’s worded in 3rd person suggests her friend typed it). Why wouldn’t she just do it from her own number and not hide behind someone else’s? So weird and unnecessary. 

What should I do? I’ve spoken to her mom as recently as last month. Should I completely ignore it, or should I show it to her mom and ask her what the problem is?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qmekr6/ex_texted_me_cryptically_from_a_friends/

2 days ago I asked you guys whether or not I should get a new apartment with my toxic gf, and the answers were as clear as day. I should break up, not a single user told me to stay with her, but the problem was I didn't have the balls to really end it, I tried to but somehow could fraise my word correct and she just brushed it off as always. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I got my Covid Vaccine shot and she is very heavy Anti-Vax, but in Austria, the regulations are getting harder and harder for not vaccinated people. She and I both agreed that I get my shot and she wanted to get hers too, but she pussied out the last minute and I went for it and got my shot, since yesterday 5 pm. she hasn't really talked to me or noticed anything I do, a few minutes ago I called her and ask her if she had a good trip to work and everything because I care about her (i still love her, I think I have a huge problem..), during this conversation she said that I got pure poison and she hopes that my kids are being disabled or that I die a horribly painful death... I just told her to come home as soon as work is over and now I just want to end it. This has been on my mind for a long time and now she overstepped the line, I just want her gone and out of my life. I feel like I should get one of my parents to ""supervise"" the Breakup because I'm 100% sure that she will either smash a Tv, my 3d Printer, or my PC. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just wanted to update you guys and girls and wish me the best of luck that she doesn't destroy anything or hurt me.

 A year later she was flirting with this guy and I just couldn’t cope with it and told her that I cannot just see her as a friend and it would be best for me if we didnt see each other again.
I never forgot her and hoped that we would meet again and I would take my chance this time.

Now, four years and a very long term relationship later, I am single again and I started to watch her IG stories. She started following me, and I finally built to courage to speak with her. 

We had the best conversation for three ours straight both on the phone and texting. We’re gonna meet soon and I want to show my intention from the beginning this time. I really want her and really dont wanna mess this up.

After a few days go by, no mention of the rescheduled date was brought up again. This, along with a few other reasons, I felt like maybe he wasn’t actually interested in rescheduling. 

We’re messaging a bit here and there (simple messages, a little flirty) and I (randomly) ask if he truly wants to reschedule the date or if he was not interested. 

No response. 

I was going to let it go at that point considering I probably had my answer right there. But I needed to make sure all was okay because an absolute no response just didn’t seem like him. So I follow up the next day (not exactly wording in message) hoping everything was ok and that I understand and wished him well.

I'm aware this is 99% chance a polite rejection, but the desperate part of me wants to believe she will be interested once she has grieved her relationship (if that's even true, it did seem genuine though).

I guess I'm latching onto her saying she'd be keen to catch up sometime as a sign that perhaps she does eventually want to meet up.

And then you also run the risk of eventually forgetting almost, if not all of, a person and experience that once meant something to you.

85,qmi8f3,1636024191,Its always something,"My new friends brought a new person with them the night we were going bar hopping and over time I started to be interested in her and I thought she was attracted to me because we kept flirting with each other. Even as I had to help her get into the car, because she was in a motorized chair, I thought she was looking at me a lot after I put her down. 

The next night I  was invited to a Halloween party  at her parent's house. She kept suggesting shots and as that went on our flirting got more overt and innocently physical. It escalated to us making out a few times. Before we parted I got her number and we messaged the next day still flirting and making banter. 

Then the day after I decided to try to do the goodmorning text thing. She replied with ""I'm sorry I'm not in the right place to date"" and my heart sunk because I've heard that line a couple of times before and it ends the same way, blocked/ignored. It seemed it was a way to ""let me down gently"" and  when I  was more naive I thought ""maybe we could still talk"". Now I just started wondering ""where did I fuck up"". My mind went to my telling her I lived with my parents, or the fact that I'm  5 years younger than her, and (unfortunately) I even went to the dark spot of thinking it was because  I'm 5'4 and she's 5'10 and I swore to myself I would not think that way (plus that made no sense because she was in a chair most of the time it didn't really matter right?!). And now if I'm invited out by those friends idk if I should go because I don't want to make it so she can't go with them and enjoy herself with them because she feels the need to avoid me. I know I'm  probably overthinking that part but still its in my head. 

Tldr: I got the ""I'm not in the right place the date"" line from this girl that I  thought I  clicked together with super well.

87,qmij2w,1636025416,My [29M] girlfriend [F24] makes me feel like I'm just a tickbox and like I'm inadequate all the time. I've tried talking to her about it but she always ends up making me feel like I'm the problem. Maybe I am?,"We've been together for 3 months, the first 2 months were great and she seemed REALLY into me. It has all gone very fast, she works from mine most of the time, she has loads of her stuff here, she's already planning all these fancy expensive holidays for us abroad (she earns a lot more than me).

It's just, her sense of humour I've noticed is very condescending, like she just wants to point out my flaws all of the time about how untidy I am, the layout of my apartment, how disorganised I am.. I'm trying my best to get better at it but we're just very different, I'm a creative for a living and a very liberal person, she's more conservative and very corperate.

So she also likes to schedule and plan everything and sometimes it's just a bit of a buzzkill, like even last night, she was really tired and where I'd given her oral sex twice a day for 3 days and she's not been to tired to reciprocate (which is fine, she's normally VERY generous) she was kind of like ""Sorry I'm just really tired, I'll give you a blowjob if you want"" and I said ""No no, you're tired, don't worry about it, but well... I've bought some oil and how about I give you a slow sensual full body massage?"" and she shot me down right away with ""no I'm good"" and I said ""oh don't worry I won't try and seduce you with it, this is something just for you"" and she said ""yeah but do you even know how to give a massage? there are people who train for years who do it and if you don't do it properly you could trap a nerve and do damage"" so I just laid on my back and said ""Okay, don't worry"" and she asked if I was upset and I just shrugged it off with ""Well, a bit savage I was only trying to offer something nice but it's okay, it just feels like sometimes you don't think I'm capable of anything"" (I've cooked her a few really nice meals she loved but now she's taken over and won't even let me help her in the kitchen)

Then she went into all the buzzkill stuff of how she used to own a beauty spa and how she'd only hire qualified massueses with proper training etc etc so I just said ""I know, I wasn't trying to make out like I'm a pro it was just a gesture but it's cool"" then she said ""you're just horny, I can give you a blowjob if you want"" and I said ""no it's fine, only do things like that when you feel in the mood, I'm okay""

I've noticed, although she makes the effort to do stuff with my friends and family (there's only been two events she joined) she seemed almost irritated to do it but did it fine, and put on her dry smalltalk almost like the kind of shit you hear on a zoom call. Whereas I've made a lot of effort with her friends, driven us hours out of town to spend time with her relatives and even that's kind of weird, because when she's around her sister's husband she lights up she's suddenly fun, outgoing, chilled out (he's also a bit like me, liberal, creative, relaxed) and they talk accross the room to each other almost like I don't exist.

I've tried talking to her about examples like this before and her responses are ""I don't feel comfortable now, I feel like I have to watch everything I say"" and then it just makes me feel worse.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qmij2w/my_29m_girlfriend_f24_makes_me_feel_like_im_just/

When I joined eharmony last year my only matches were with people outside my country, mostly the US, Canada, UK etc. I have been chatting to someone for more than a year and we really like each other. She is based in the US. 

You always read stories of situations like this working out, but I feel like it wouldn’t work out for me. There is no way she will leave the US, but I would have no problem going over there. Given the complexities of US visas/marriage for a green card, is this worth the hassle and how do I know it’s worth the hassle? My family and hers would most likely shun/disprove of the whole idea, but my dream would be to be living over there with her. I’m in my 30s now and getting older by the day. I think if the US wasn’t so hard to immigrate to I would more likely give it a go. 

So what should I be thinking about here and discussing with her?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qmj6pp/ldr_with_someone_overseas_how_do_these_things_end/
91,qmjh93,1636028970,Why do girls get a kick out of rejecting guys very harshly and hurting their feelings?,"So through my years of rejections I’ve had the pleasure of experiencing some pretty crushing ones. 

I’ve been laughed at, has my texts posted online, recorded, threatened, had drinks thrown on me, insulted, just a numerous amount of bad things. Idk why. I’m not pushy, if they just say no thank you I don’t try to press into why not, I just leave, I don’t send inappropriate messages. 

I just try to have a conversation. I don’t even ask them out, literally all I’m doing is trying to talk to girls. I’ve even had at least 5 girls match with me on Tinder to tell me that I’m ugly or weird looking. I have had one girl tell me I looked like a sexual predator.

I’m not doing anything to them. I’m trying to treat them just as I would guys I wanted to get to know. I’m not going for girls I think are attractive, I’m going for other ugly people and they’re still unbelievably rude more often than not.

So I ask why? Why do women find this so fun to do? Do they even think about how the guys they say these things to have feelings?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qmjh93/why_do_girls_get_a_kick_out_of_rejecting_guys/
92,qmjkn5,1636029294,Very new at this. Is he interested?,"When you say constant communication, is it okay if he takes so much time to reply? Like 1 or 2 hrs? (He likes watching TV shows. And he's a gamer, so I'm thinking, he watches or plays while we talk) and sometimes, he doesn't message me for 1 to 2 days. I don't really mind at all. Because I also got a lot of things to do.

But he always goes back. And checks up on me.
But of course, there are moments when we talk for like 2 to 3 hours non stop

I guess I am just thinking if this is something that a guy who's interested in you would do. 😊

We've never met yet by the way. And we've been talking for over a month.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qmjkn5/very_new_at_this_is_he_interested/
93,qmjq8o,1636029829,Anti rejection,"I had a wonderful long night with this girl. 
Long story short, we both have a rough past and don't feel capable of being emotionally involved with anyone but said we were at first. 
I sent her a long message last night saying I can't read her as time goes on. She said she would be busy and she has been, but she said maybe soon so I kept texting. Until I blew and just asked her if she's fading me out, just that busy or not trying to hurt my feeling by rejecting me. 

She clicked back basically saying she doesn't want to reach out because she's afraid I will get feelings for her and she thinks she will hurt me at some point. I just told her that it seems like we both want to change, we're both self aware and both not really in a place to give our all to someone and just said if you ever want to try this, I'm down, I just want an escape just like you.. She's my type of crazy and I do have feelings for her and clearly she feels something towards me if she's afraid she isn't good enough to avoid hurting me. 

Is there any way I can through to her? She said she's not the one but I think she is. She's so smart and kind and considerate. I told her if she's afraid of a good thing, I can relate all too well and left it at that. 

I just don't want to lose this. We connect at so many levels it hurts to see her pull away out of fear for hurting me. Worse than just saying no or ghosting because I know she cares and I care too and that's rare these days. We're both not good enough in our own heads but I know we are.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qmjq8o/anti_rejection/
94,qmjr7t,1636029919,Forever finding strangers beautiful. Anyone who flirts with or tries to talk to me I instantly start to find them unattractive (I'm a guy),"So before u turned 18 I'd slept with a LOT of women then I got my heart 'broken' even though I'd cheated on here a few times I still belief to this day I really love her. I'm 23 now. 6ft. Athletic build. I'd say I was slightly above average ( but then again i might not be) I really really struggle trying to talk to women. A lot of the time. Even when i don't find them attractive. The only matches a get on tinder are people who look they've already given up on life. Or people who slightly bigger.

I've matched with this women in my town she's 3 years older. She's seems smart. And easy to talk. But the way she talks to me is kinda of how you'd talk someone you looking for marriage material. She seems quite sensitive. And she's a. But bigger than what I'd normally be interested in. 


This goes for anyone tbh but I like a challenge if she w
really keen it will out me off massively even if she's stunning. But if they talking to someone and the conversations one way. I'll literally just give up on the spot it hurts my feelings even when I know it shouldn't.

96,qmjytv,1636030638,Help with girl,"Hi I (M21) fell for a girl that is in my class (F17). Out of body language I figured she did not feel the same. I said it to her I was right. That didn't hit me to hard. A few days after she also tolled me she had a boyfriend. (Was already there at the time). 

That hit me more than it should have. A lot of mental stuff came out. Things I am very insecure about. I have days where I would prefer to headbutt a train. I am going to get professional help. I have also talked with a lot of people about it. So that is not really my problem.

My problem is her. Preferably i would make sure that we would never see each other again. And than let things bleed out on socials. Because I have still got feelings. (Stupid me). But this is not possible she is in my class with only 6 other people. 

And she has gotten my travel buddy because we most of the times leave school at the same time. And have to start at the same time.

When she didn't know I had feeling I made sure I sat next to her. I think now she does in reverse.

What should I do. I cannot break bonds because of school (and quitting school is not going to happen).

I just don't know what to do and I only see bad options",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qmjytv/help_with_girl/
97,qmk1dc,1636030859,Is this a bad idea,"25M here. Só there is this girl I have been talking to and I really would love to go out with her.

The problem is... I used to go out with her roomate. So when I asked her out the other day, she said yes but after a while she retracted because she felt uncomfortable about it. 

I get it and totally understand, but I still don't want to give up. She kinda answers to my texts and I think she'd be willing to give me a chance if I just played it right. 

So I was thinking about sending a gift (a few desserts from ifood) to both of them tonight after they are home from work. Just as a way to make her think more kindly about the idea of going out with me. 


Is this a really bad idea? I have sent gifts to other girls in the past like this even before going out for the first time and it really worked.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qmk1dc/is_this_a_bad_idea/

99,qmkdnk,1636031918,"Guy (M, 25)texted me (F, 24) but then didn't respond","Hey, I am really confused about this situation with a guy that I am currently dating. A week ago, I was having a date with this guy. It was our second date and it went really well. He asked me out for this second date, then suggested that he wanted to cook for me. So he cooked for me, we had a really long conversation, then we decided to watch a movie. I wanted to go home but we both realized that it was super late and he offered me to stay at his place. I slept there but nothing really happened besides a kiss. Then - before I was just about to fall asleep - he told me that it was a super nice evening and he really enjoyed it. In the morning he brought me coffee to bed and also cut off a bit of his plant because I really liked it and he said that I should put it in water so I can have my own one soon. I left pretty soon after we finished the coffee and went home to my place. After a few days he texted me in the middle of the night and asked about a club that we were both talking about earlier (???). I responded the next day and told him that I was already sleeping. I also asked him about his evening. He still has not gotten back to me and I am super confused about the situation. Like why would he say all of this and text me in the first place if he wouldn't respond after all. I kind of want to text him something but I don't know what would be suitable in this situation.
