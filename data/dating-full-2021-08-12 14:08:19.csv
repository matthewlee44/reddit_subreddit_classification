Let me explain, as soon as a girl joins Tinder she is flooded with guys, and some of the guys are extremely attractive (I doubt that she will have a grasp of attention from them in real life). As a result, girls are extremely selective, as they don't experience any cost with swiping left. Meanwhile, in real life, no one likes to reject somebody. Additionally, girls in real life are quite shy and they are approached less frequently (unlike tinder bombardment). 

To sum up, the behaviour of girls online is different to their behaviour offline. Average and above-average guys should have a lot more leverage offline. 

Could someone please share their experience with me? And do you agree?

You should have a much better outcome with girls in real life if you just try to pay attention or indicate that you like them. 

For example, you had liked a barista and you had a small chitchat with her (how are you? do you like your job? are studying? ), said a couple of compliments like: 'i like the way you tie your hair' or 'i like you nails' and so on. She will recognise you and you can just leave your phone number on a receipt. 

Congratulations, you had approached her and you did it in a non-embarrassing manner. She will have a choice to call or not, but at the same time, you had to approach her in a nice non-threatening environment. If you approach 10 girls in the same way, there will be a chance that one or two will call you.

He's responsible, intelligent, clever, interesting, and when we initially started talking things really seemed to line up in a way they haven't with others (communication, effort, honesty, respect/consideration, committed to goals, and shared values).

As time's gone on though I've come to realize he doesn't meet the standards I've set for myself. We don't share a similar lifestyle (he's 28 and spends nearly every weekend getting drunk going out with friends or weekdays he'll go out drinking and consistently tells me ""I didn't even realize or intend to get so drunk"" which is ???).

Our goals don't really line up and getting together would be overcomplicated. We don't even have an easy time talking to one another - he wears me out sometimes. Additionally, some of the things he says are jarring and off putting to me (generalizing people, can be super caustic and visceral in some of his remarks). He also makes fun of my dad for being ignorant (differing political views) and has shared some outlandish stories with me about parties he's gone to or wild nights out and how he's treated/spoken to other people. He frames it as funny, but I can't imagine how mortifying it was for the workers/individuals he was interacting with.

So, we've been seeing each other only when I came to visit but texted/video-chatted for almost a year. Last time I came back in March I asked if we can end the FWB as I was not feeling comfortable in the situation and long-distance is not an option. I also proposed to remain friends/keep the contact but not so often (as I wasn't sure of his response I though of it as a nice way to end things, tbh). He agreed that he didn't like the relationship lately as well, and fast forward 1 month after this conversation he texted me again and we have been texting once a week briefly for the last 4 months until I came back from abroad.

Last time he sent me lovely message was 3 weeks ago, and while now I am now back in my country and texted him asking how's life and that I decided to return from abroad. I also asked him for a small advice just to keep the conversation going (advice on how to train for a specific race in a month). He congratulated me with the return and sounded a bit nervous in the beginning of a voice memo he sent as a reply to the advice I asked. He also said that ""it looks like he also has a new life stage and began dating some girl 2 weeks ago"", but simultaneously offered to train me for the race I'm preparing for the next 5 weeks (create training plan, give advice etc). I replied that relationship is a smart decision of him and agreed to be trained. I now send him the summary of my every training 4 times per week (as he asked to do it), but unsure of his reasoning for this whole training thing.

From my side, I would like to meet with him just to see how he is doing, but don't want it to be romantic/intervene with his brand new relationship.

Obviously, I can't speak for everyone or people who are older than us because I don't have everyone's experience or the experience of dating in my 30s or up. But... I think that in general, the average person in their 20s who hasn't dated before has nothing to be worried about. I think that all of us have this perspective, that's probably media and dating app based, that like 99% of people our age have already dated around and had tons of partners before. In reality, I would say probably around 60-70% of the girls I knew in college had never dated before. The ones that had dated before were usually split into three camps. The super outgoing and friendly girls that talked to everyone and went out a lot, the girls that were still dating their high school boyfriend, or the girls that started dating a guy that joined their college friend group. But seriously, any time that a group of us girls would hang out, over half of us would agree (jokingly) that we would just die alone and be dog moms or something because we were in college and had still never dated. 


I can't speak for guys on this, but honestly just based off of interactions I've had with guys in college (the time when it's supposed to be easiest to date and hookup), it seems like most guys in their early 20s have either very little or zero experience dating. I think a lot of people probably aren't honest about this in social settings because there's this belief that there's something wrong with you if you haven't dated before at this age or that being a late bloomer makes you weird and lame. My boyfriend and I didn't meet and start dating until I was 23 and he was 26, and we're (I don't think lol) not too weird. I was scared that dating someone at 23 for the first time would be weird because I'd never even kissed or held hands with someone before. It actually wasn't though, and it all comes very naturally.


Also, I think it's becoming a lot more normal to be a late bloomer now more than ever. If you've ever looked at those age demographic graphs of the US, we're slowly becoming more like Japan and Italy in that we have a large rising older generation and not enough young kids to replace them. I'm not going to go in to reasons behind this, because I'm not an expert and I'm sure there's tons of reasons we don't know about, but basically that means that people our age just aren't having kids like our parents did. In general, we're having kids a lot later in life (30s and 40s) and we're not all getting married at 18 straight out of high-school like some of our grandparents and great-grandparents did. In fact, it's a little weird now if you do get married at 18 straight out of high-school. Again, no scientific proof of this, but I bet because people are getting married and having kids way later, we also start dating much later now too. 


Anyway, I hope this helps all you 20yos feel better about your prospects and life and stuff. There's no need to rush things. Even though things are going great between me and my bf, I'm aware that we could potentially break up in the distant future and I'd have to start all over again, so I hope this doesn't sound too preachy and like I know everything already just because I've got my first bf.

I’m spending my time improving my career further, preparing to compete in pro sports and planning to travel alone. I’m content with this but it just doesn’t feel right? 
Is it too much to ask for somebody? 
It’d be nice to have someone who wanted to go places together and explore the world. Someone who could train with me. Someone who would game with me. Someone to take along to social events instead of being the single one. Someone to cook for and watch films with. Just somebody who cared.

I got tangled with a narcissistic man. At first it began as the victim half lie story of how his wife left him because she cheated ( also he told me that he got a restraining order from her, and me too naive and blinded by the love bombing by passed it 🤦‍♀️). And then, proceeded to tell me that he is seeing another girl at the same time as me ( we met on a dating app and I supposed that it was normal for some people). 

Some time passed and I got obviously discarded for the other girl... although, a twist to the story - she decided to stay with her boyfriend and have no relationship with the narc. 

He came back to me, at this point I had moved on somehow. He came back to his happy self, which was a surprise to me as the discard phase was pretty traumatizing. 
But I couldn't handle it as he was still entertaining the girl he discarded me for, and also another girl that he met at the same time that we were dating. 

I left him at that point because my anxiety was too high and I disliked his constant entertainement of other girls. 

Anyways, 2 months later I saw him again (shared activity) and he tells me that he has good news. The good news are that he got with girl he was talking to and that he is moving with her to another city... AND yet, he was still telling me how much he loved me and missed me (and wants to keep contact with me as friends/lovers). They're in a polyarmorist relationship on his request.

Some background: my past two relationships have been abusive and toxic. I (F25) have re-entered the dating scene and I’ve been casually seeing someone for two months.

He (M30) doesn’t quite know what he wants and I am open to casual or working towards something. But we decided we’ll label this as casual for the time being. 

That being said, prior to this conversation there was an incident (which actually triggered the dtr conversation). I sent him a ~spicy~ picture with a caption asking him to do something. His response was “it looks like someone already did but I’m happy to oblige”. Mind you it was a pimple and I haven’t been sleeping with anyone else.

I was taken back and also kinda pissed. I felt like he was trying to get information without actually asking. He explained that he felt insecure and handled it wrongly. We talked about it and he apologized and I believe his apology was genuine. 

I tend to over analyze things like this. Is this a red flag? Could this be an indication that he’s possessive? 

I haven’t felt secure in a casual or significant relationship in a long time so this is a very new feeling to me.

I know it has been said many times before, but today I went through the city I live in and I was conscious about my surroundings. I had just been on instagram to check out stuff due to boredom and felt a bit sad because I do not look like these people. Then it daunted on me as I went outside, nobody I pass on the street looks like these people, literally nobody. Today I saw a bunch of average looking people and you know what? I was one of them.

I do not look different than 95% of the world, yes I may have my physical flaws, but so does a lot of other people. The prettiest girl I saw, she would have been way below average if she was on Instagram. And that made me realize that the only reason I get sad about my appearance, is because I live in a fantasy world of social medias and movies (where the like top 5% of good looking people are concentrated into one pile). The best looking guy I saw was a pretty ordinary guy, but you know why I thought he looked good? He looked like he worked out a bit (normal size, not steroid size) and wore a fitting white t-shirt.

It's not the ""finding people to date"" part that is hard for me out there in the dating world. I can get quality matches on any app, and have met some great people. I'm also fortunate enough that I've got a good bullshit factor to steer clear of the guys just seeking hookups.

Do you know what's probably worse in the discouragement department than rude interactions, getting ghosted after a few dates, or having guys disappear on the app hours before you were supposed to meet, though? It's when you DO meet someone who you actually do genuinely connect with and makes you feel relieved you found each other, only for something to happen that causes them to need to take a step away from dating for their own personal reasons, and so everything gets put on hold there, and you end up back at square one on the app (and all your new matches just don't compare to that one person who needed a dating break.)

I can't blame anyone for taking care of their health over getting into a relationship, but lately I can't help but feel like my options are either the discouragement of the worst aspects of dating or experiencing great options slip from my hands.

I’m gonna be honest. I had really high hopes, the connection we had when we were at the beach, really had me excited and I thought she was cool and my type. I’m really hurt.

# Met a girl at the psych ward CHAPTER 2

**Intro below. If it bores you then just skip straight to the story.**

This is a pretty unusual story about life, death and of course a little about love.  
Reddit original movie coming soon.. Stay tuned.

After 10s of requests I decided to make a follow up story to ""Met a girl at the psych ward"" So here goes everything..  


A wise man once said that if not you, who? If not now, when? -Zen master Rinzai.   


Love is all around. Dont search for it where you first lost it and you will eventually find it somewhere. Maybe even in the most unexpected of places, like in for example the psych ward.  


So lets buckle up and try to make this story decent enough so that at least one person wants to read it.  


I also would love some feedback on the part where I add some backstory and if it is truly necessary.  


If you read the original post, you can feel free to skip chapter 1. I have changed it a little but not a lot.

**CHAPTER 1**

Not going to go into too much detail about how I ended up there but I was hospitalized for about 9 months after a proper mental breakdown. It was a place where we were focused on recovery so it was after the emergency stuff.

So we were about 10 patients and probably around 40 staff. At first I was just too ill to really socialize. One of the staff asked me if I had met this girl yet. I said ""no"". She then said that it was the pretty one. I had no idea until a few days later when I met her. She was pretty and seemed quite healthy.

She seemed somewhat cold at first and I didn't really try to get to know her. Just assumed she wasn't interested in talking. But at the hospital we had a lot of activities so eventually most of the patients were talking to each others.

I think she started talking to me out of boredom after a couple weeks. I realized we had a lot to talk about and we actually got quite a lot in common. She was 23 at the time and I was 25. So we often just sat around in the living room talking for hours every day.

I started crushing on her a few weeks after that. So I tried to find ways of flirting with her without making it too obvious. So in the beginning we often sat together when going on a road trip etc. She flirted back eventually and we were basically together but I never kissed her. It wasn't really socially accepted.

The staff often told me that what we had was special and that I needed to stay in touch with her after I left the hospital. I thought I had found a girl that I could stay with indefinitely.

She eventually left the hospital after staying there for 4 years. The time we got together wasn't too much. 2-3 months maybe. I stayed for 6 more months after that and I lost contact with her completely.

I never forgot about her although my crush for her gradually dissipated. So when I finally got out of the hospital I realized I still got her number and wanted to check in on her. I called her. I told her my sister just bought an apartment in her city and that I was in town for the weekend if she wanted to meet.

So we met up and things went pretty well. We met several times a week for a few weeks and seemed to never run out of things to talk about.

I eventually asked her if we could be together and she rejected me at first. She told me she wasn't ready and to be honest I wasn't really ready myself. So we stayed friends for the next 3 years. The spark between us was always there and we met around 10 hours a week almost every week during that time.

We were basically in a relationship even though we never took any serious steps. And it was long distance so we couldn't meet every day. It was just during weekends mostly. And we both had abandonment issues so we had a somewhat dysfunctional relationship. It was nice despite all of that. None of us were ready for a sexual relationship. We were somewhat intimate but it were mostly an emotional connection.

So we watched each others grow over those several years. We both got better and better for each passing month. She eventually got a dog and two birds. I got myself a cat. She bought an apartment next to my sisters apartment so they became neighbors.

Eventually she started referring to our meetings as dates instead of just hanging out. We started sharing drinks and food. We started holding hands and talked about future plans. She invited me to sleep over once her apartment is ready.

I am meeting her again tomorrow. I haven't kissed her yet despite knowing her for 4 years.

But I feel ready.

**Chapter 1, Extra:**

I didn't meet up with her last weekend as planned. She turned ill and didn't answer my calls for 8 days. I got confused and hurt but my worries was just that.

I met her again today and she told me she haven't slept since last time we met. We went for a 2 hours late night walk along the river.

I asked her why she wasn't sleeping and she wouldn't tell.

I asked her if I was stressing her out and she teared up.

I didn't speak a word for the next 10 minutes or so, just trying to figure out where she was at. She broke the silence by asking me how I was doing. I told her I was doing alright. I joked a bit and she started to lighten up a little.

I decided not to flirt with her today since she seemed to be in a quite low mood. She also seemed ashamed of telling me everything about what was really going on. I continued by digging a little to get to the bottom of it.

She gave it away eventually. I barely touched her shoulder as some sort of emotional support and she put her arm around me. Then she starting flirting quite a lot but she seemed sad.

So I know what she is thinking now. She is very much into me and that freaks her out. She is unaware of how pretty she is. She is actually hiding her personality from the world sometimes.

I followed her home.

I wished her good night, gave her the longest hug I have ever given her, held her hands and looked her into her eyes while telling her not to freak out tonight. I also sent her a message afterwards wishing her a good night but by then she was already out.

I am meeting her again tomorrow. Hopefully she is able to rest a little so that we can have a proper date tomorrow.

**Backstory (please post feedback on this section. Not sure if this is necessary). May remove it.**

A couple of weeks ago I posted a story in this sub which got up voted into the stratosphere. A lot of people have asked me to do a follow up. So here we go back on the roller coaster.  
A while after a couple terrible events that shook me to the core, I withdrew from society altogether and moved into a tent in the middle of a dark forest in Northern Norway. I needed an escape from everything.

It was named the dark woods natural reserve. It was very silent out there and it was freezing cold during winter. And it was dark as hell. No light whatsoever. I lived on whatever food I could catch. A lot of fish, some small animals and sometimes I walked for 12 miles to the nearest store to buy some extra meat to survive.

I started sitting at an old abandoned graveyard at night deep into the woods, communicating with the dead. It was comforting. Felt like I was closer to all my departed friends and family members. My best friend committed suicide after his girlfriend was shot dead in cold blood. Several more suicides after that. I never knew who was next. Some even committed suicide and I didn't find out until years later. After a while I started hallucinating. I guess it was all the time alone in a dark forest in the middle of nowhere. I started seeing twisted faces in the dark. In the beginning I thought it was just being afraid of the dark for some in explainable reason.

But after a while I couldn’t get it to stop. I saw twisted faces and dead people everywhere I went. It was my demons haunting me and for me it was as real as it gets. I went in a constant state of anxiety and fear. I thought I was really loosing it once and for all when I was bitten by an imaginary snake and bugs crawled out of the wound while several more snakes were all over me. Then a corpse started talking to me and told me to take my life basically so I could join my friends.

So one evening when I was on the last page of my hand made leather diary, I decided to end it. It was the end of my diary so I spend the two last pages on writing a suicide note, saying sorry to everyone for what i was about to do. I said goodbye to all my Facebook friends. I thought why not make this book the story of my life?

So I mixed all the pills I got with alcohol. It was a deadly dose by far. This was at school late at night. For some reason the universe wasn’t done with me yet though. I had managed to get some friends despite spending most of my time in a dark forest. So my friend, Amanda had noticed that I didn’t seem like myself and had called the police to do a welfare check on me. She also called me and I picked up the phone for once. She was the first to arrive at the scene where I was sitting with knifes and a rope trying to decide how to pop off. She was crying her heart out and told me I needed help. Shortly after I got picked up by the ambulance.

I wasn’t dead yet. So the next day I was at the hospital and stayed in the emergency psych ward for around 2 weeks before I got transferred for a 9 month stay at a center for treatment of complex trauma disorders. Amanda visited me at the emergency psych ward and told me that everything would be alright and that she would always be around if I needed her. We are still friends several years later. She saved my life basically.

My life was in scrambles. I wasn’t suicidal anymore after the emergency psych ward, but I didn’t really care if I was hit by a train or whatever. During the first few weeks at this new place, I was too ill to socialize a lot.

What happened there changed my life I would say.

**CHAPTER 2**

I dont usually believe in destiny but during my life I haven't met many soul mates. The girl I met at the psych ward is one of very few I have ever met that I believe is a soul mate destined to stay with me trough rebirth and death until the end of times as a friend, lover, sibling. If anything like that exists anyways.

Even if we dont end up together I consider us friends for life and beyond. I put this friendship above a relationship but I wont look elsewhere until we have both decided where we will go from here.

We have had a couple really good dates recently. We have met up for at least 4 very long dates of 8+ hours. We went paddle boarding one day and she paid for it. I have never tried it before but she thought it was fun.

We went bowling the next day. They had turned down the lightning that day and the music was relaxing and quite romantic. We didn't focus too much on the bowling really. We ordered a few drinks and it was nice. We just glared at each others and had some really deep conversations. I touched her face and her lips and she had her hands on my shoulders while looking me into my eyes.

On our way back we ordered some bubble tea. We shared and held hands a few times. The next day we went out to eat breakfast together. We walked around for a long time. She usually walks pretty fast so I have figured out that in order to communicate properly with her, I have to suggest that we sit down every now and then.

I showed her some of my martial art skills. One of them included grabbing her head and almost kissing her. She did the same thing back just to check if it actually worked. She showed me some bailey moves and that was honestly quite a turn on. I didn't realize she was a bailey dancer before but even know she can surprise me.

I touched her neck and she asked me if I could give her a neck massage. I did. We walked around for a little while longer until we were almost home. We sat down below a large tree and lied on the grass. I asked her to listen to a new song I had found on Spotify. A new version of Begging. So we lied on the grass for a few minutes listening to the song.

I then took a personality test on her to figure out which character she was in the Netflix series Lucifer. We both took the test. Turned out she was Lucifer's mom, the Goddess of all creation and an ENFP. I was Mazikeen, Lucifer's bartender and an INFJ.

After that I walked her home and asked her how her apartment is going. She invited me in. We were both quite tired and sat down on her couch. After she showed me around of course. It was looking nice and quite girly.

Her kitchen was painted in pink. She got stylish roof lamps and the floor was made of some fancy wood. She showed me around in her bedroom and told me she was going to toss out her bed and buy a larger one. When I left, I thought that was it for the day but she said she just needed a few hours to rest then she wanted to meet up again.

So we met up again around 9 pm and went for a walk again. It was still hot outside despite it being late. We walked for around an hour until we arrived at a quiet lake. We were all alone. We took off our shoes and tested the temperature. We sat there for maybe 20 minutes. She asked me if I wanted to go for a swim.

None of us were properly dressed for a swim. I told her to go first. After contemplating for around 10 minutes she stripped off her clothes and started swimming. I did the same thing. The full moon was shining bright.

It was the perfect moment to kiss her. It was our most romantic moment yet. It was perfect.

Its been almost 2 weeks since last time I met her and it will be at least 4 weeks by the time we meet again.

I have started studying at university again and started working out and doing martial arts again. I started getting in touch with my friends again. I found new friends at university. I play Fortnite from time to time with a friend. One time I talked with my girlfriend (she is my girlfriend at this point although we have only kissed) about gaming. She didn't do it a lot but she said that she liked Skyrim. I told her I played Fortnite and she told me she wanted to play some day.

So last week, me, my friend and one of her friends joined me to play a game of Fortnite. We won the first two games easily. It was a pretty awesome session where we played squads with my girfriend, her best friend and me and my friend. I am not sure if she actually wanted to play Fortnite but she wanted to stay in touch and it was a nice way to socialize.

She told me I should try playing Fortnite professionally since I seemed to win every game. Maybe not the worst idea but I am working on many things right now. Building a social circle, getting in shape, taking a Bachelors. She is going to go back to art school and try to make a career in making art. She is incredible. It is fascinating seeing how easily she can make a masterwork in 5 minutes.

We have agreed to start working out together. She is quite slim but workout is good for anyone so we will try to find a way to work out together soon.

We are planning on spending a week together in September. I look forward to it and I hope we can pull it off.

After we matched I was pleasantly surprised that she felt the same way. Our chemistry was immediate, we quickly set up a date for today at 1pm and she gave me her number. I did something I usually don’t do and let myself get excited for the date.

When we moved off of Tinder I noticed that she took a lot longer to reply. Tuesday through today we didn’t talk much at all. I didn’t think much of it as she told me she changed shifts since I left and now works overnights, because of that I didn’t really know the best time to text her. I did not want to seem like a bother and I know her job is physically taxing, so she’d be very tired after work.

Her name was Sara. I had known her for the past two years. For me, She was the nicest person I had ever known. We were almost like a couple. Every one in our class said that it was obvious we both liked each other. Some of my friends encouraged me to propose her. But, i was afraid that she would say no and it would ruin our friendship.

In grade 9 we had prom. I asked her to be my partner and she accepted. That day was the closest we had ever been romantically. I was very very happy dancing with her. I thought things could finally go ahead between us. But nothing happened between us.

In grade 10 she had got herself a boyfriend. But, she was having problems in her relationship. I wasn't happy with the fact that she had a boyfriend but as her best friend, with a heavy decided to help her in her relationship. I listened to her, gave her advice, said not to give up on her relationship.

One day, i heard from one of my friends that sara was having an affair with one of my classmate. Every morning they would make out in the school store room. I thought it was just a rumor but the next day i saw them making out in the store room and When the class started she came and sat next to me like nothing happened.
After that day i felt disgusted with her. The kind, nicest sara i knew was all a lie. I knew i had nl right to feel that way, but i did. Since then i slowly went distant from her.
It's been 4 years but i still cannot forget her. I feel like what i did was right but, leaving her is one of my biggest regrets. Even today i have feelings for her. when i go on a date with another girl i start to have this feeling that I'm cheating on her.

I'm demisexual so I'm rarely attracted to people but the last person I dated was the first person I was sexually attracted to. 

However, he quickly turned out to be controlling, emotionally abusive and tried to memorise my debit/EFTPOS card PINs. He also hacked my phone, and was rekindling things with his ex.

From a man’s perspective, I’ve read this is especially true for women when they are deciding whether to date a guy because it’s like implied vouching for the dude that they’re cool and safe.

I’m 27 and an introvert for the most part and I think realistically, I only have like 2 or 3 people that I would consider closer friends who I talk to more regularly who don’t feel like a chore to keep in touch with because we naturally vibe well and communication isn’t difficult. The rest of my friendships are more surface level acquaintances that I hang out with once in a while randomly for a night out, dinner, or a bbq or something. 

I base a lot of my friendships on communication, and those that don’t communicate much, or do their own things without thinking about me (when I frequently think of them) usually I don’t pursue deeper friendships with. I have a lot of people in my life that when we talk, it’s so difficult to have deeper or more personal conversations to the point that I actually find it difficult to picture them talking about anything serious, so these tend to stay as acquaintances.

So my question is this: when girls (and guys) say they want someone who has a social circle, what do they define as a social circle? Does my situation count where I have a few close friends and quite a few acquaintances? Or do they expect you to be close to the whole circle (which I find to be difficult and maybe impossible to sustain at most five close friendships at once)?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,951405,public,self,Question about “social circle” definition,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/p36wyz/question_about_social_circle_definition/,all_ads,6,,,,,

I came out to friends as a senior in high school. I just assumed, or convinced myself I guess, that all the crushes I had on girls prior were just me convincing myself I wasn’t gay. 

Anyways, after exploring my sexuality at college I now realize that that’s indeed not the case. 

So that brings me to the topic at hand:

There’s this girl who works the desk at the gym I go to who I find incredibly attractive. She’s more “cute” than like drop dead super model level gorgeous if that makes sense? But cute is what I like haha. 

Anyways, I want to ask her out or at least get to know her but I have no experience with girls. With guys I just use dating apps for sex, dates, or whatever else so that makes it easy. I’ve never tried my luck with asking a girl out though. I’ve done various sexual things with a few different girls at college, but we were usually at parties and they tended to initiate everything. 

My question is, where the fuck do I begin? I’ve got a bit of social anxiety as it is so that doesn’t help. I don’t think I’m too terrible looking, average body (though improving, hence the gym lol). She seems a bit quite at first herself, and the gym is pretty small and I go like 4 times a week so I’m worried about embarrassing the shit out of myself.

Met a girl at my retail job about a year ago. Started talking to her and she started joining me on my breaks at work just about everyday we worked together. She immediately caught my interest as in my experience girls who are not interested do not go out of their way to talk to me or take breaks with me

Over the next 6 months i started to get to know her better in time we spent talking on our breaks. These talks would usually end up going 5-15 minutes over our scheduled break time once we got to know each other better. 

She started asking me more personal questions about my life, interests, and school. Alot more personal questions than ive ever had with any other co workers. She would ask about my family and follow up on the things I told her. 

She told me a lot about herself as well and always seemed excited to sit down and talk with me. She always wanted to know what I was up to on the weekends and told me she wanted to go to some museum once the pandemic was over. 

She even mensioned to me that she was single on valentines day and asked if i gad any plans. Then proceeded to randomly tell me that a few coworkers hit on her but she wasn’t interested. I changed the topic as i was un comfortable. 

 After about 6 months i finally got up the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me with no hesitation.  Texted her the next day and we texted back and forth about 6 times until i got distracted and didn’t get back to her until the next day. Texted her the next day and had to go to bed early and left the convo. 

The next day I texted her but got no response… thought i was ghosted but then texted her a day or two after and she texted back  I then asked her if she wanted to go out on a date to which she said she didn’t think she could because she had a brother with health issues and may me vulnerable to the pandemic. I thought this was her way of rejecting me. 

I told her i understood and I wouldn’t talk to her anymore. I understand how awkward it can be to be asked out and I didn’t want her to be un comfterbal. She said I didn’t need to do that as she really enjoyed our relationship. She told me to treat her the same and said a few other things that confirmed she understood I asked her out. 

Didn’t talk to her or hear from her until I saw her at work next. I tried to avoid her but that was impossible once she sat down with my on my break. We talked for an hour and the topic of that never came up. I didn’t know where I stood or how she felt about the whole thing. I decided i just needed to get over her

I texted her a few days later and asked her if it was ok if she could not talk to me at work because I needed to get over my feelings for her. I also told her I thought she was a cool person and was my friend, but I just needed some time but id like to remain friends. 

She told me that she was into someone else and I tried to convince her to shoot her shot because i thought we were just friends at this point. She agreed to being friends and I thought everything was fine until the next time i saw her she seemed very upset. 

It was not my intention to hurt her in any way, i just didn’t want her to feel uncomfterbal or anything like that. I texted her that afternoon and said it was ok if she wanted to talk to me at work again but i got no response

She seems to be aware and knows when people are hitting on her. She seemed used to it so idk why she wouldn’t just tell me she wasn’t interested. 

I went up and tried to apologize to her the next time i saw her but she wouldn’t even face me and said she just wanted to be vague. 

Today I was sitting in the break room alone minding my own business then she sat down across the room. My friend called me and after 30 seconds of talking to her on the phone, she gets up and hurries out of the break room. Just kinda weird.

TL;DR: met a girl and thought we clicked.

I was in my mid 20s, then, I am now in my late 20s. My life was in really bad shape a during that time (I actually began to develop serious suicidal ideation towards during that time and sought therapy). Looking back now, it was definitely one of the lowest points in my life. I am a veteran and got had a delayed reaction with being able to adapt and transition into civilian life. 

When I got out I moved in with my best friend from the military. It was felt like I was still back in. We eventually departed our own ways on good terms and then thats when really hit me. I truly felt like I was out. I lived in a bad place and alot of the shady stuff scared me and reminded me of Afghanistan. This made it very hard for me to sleep and always kept me alert. I couldn't truly relax and feel safe. When I tried to date I was super obsessive, and took events way too personal. There was no sense of redemption. I was offended easily and would lash out. It only lasted for so long before it got to a point my mind began to brake down. I had nightmares on occasion, waking up in the middle of the night like I had just ran a marathon. It was just bad. 

With therapy I began to improve a little, but I didnt really get better until I moved. The biggest thing I learned was that I take personal blame and ignore extenuating situations. Once I moved things felt so much better, I could walk the street without feeling like someone was going to stab me. I feel like I have a good mindset now, I have recently gone through my recent plunge into dating with no success but I wasn't so hyper-aggressive and mean. I didn't take personal offense, I didnt send any nasty replies, I wasn't such a douche.

I gave her my number, we text for a few days and I was going to ask her that I want to meet up with her, **but then I caught covid**...  This really put a damper on me to escalate to a date. 

So after telling her I caught it, we just continued texting about ourselves, but because I've been so worked up and feeling drained due to covid, I notice my texting isn't flirty, and mainly talking about my symptoms and normal friend texting... I just don't know what to do because I feel so drained.  

After another week of just chatting to know a bit more of each other, she now hasn't responded in the past 4 days now because I think I'm not making it interesting.  I did write last night asking how's her week has been going (which I think might not be a good text/sounding needy) since she hasn't responded to my last message.
