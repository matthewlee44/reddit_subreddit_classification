2,pcvtu7,1630097466,Unmatch if uninterested after meeting?,"Recently I’ve met a couple different OLD matches without exchanging phone numbers, just communicating thru the app. With several I haven’t been interested in a second date. For sure, if someone contacts me post-date to ask for another, I’ll send them a very polite “you’re great but I just didn’t feel the chemistry.” But I’m not sure what’s more polite to do if we’re communicating thru the app. Personally I prefer not hearing “thanks but no thanks” if I haven’t expressed interest in more, so I wouldn’t contact them unless they contacted me. But staying matched to me indicates some level of interest on my part. On the other hand, I’ve gone out with guys I liked, gone onto the app and noticed they unmatched me, and felt slightly put out.

What’s the polite thing to do? Just unmatch quietly? Or stay matched for a day or two in case they want to follow up, which I worry gives the wrong impression?

None of us love the ego hit of someone we’re interested in not being interested in us, so I try really hard to spare egos (unless someone was atrocious). That being said, I also hate the presumption of proactively saying “thanks but no thanks” if no one has expressed interest. BUT I don’t want to be the jerk who ghosts either!

Obviously if we’ve exchanged phone numbers it’s a different situation. In that case, if I’m not interested I just don’t reach out; if they do, I send them a nice “no thanks.”",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pcvtu7/unmatch_if_uninterested_after_meeting/

4,pcwuqo,1630100682,Taking breaks from OLD,"Hey all.
I got back into OLD a little over a year ago. Before then I had a few relationships from people that I met organically, so the last time I did OLD was 2014/15. Tthings have changed a lot! I've found it a lot more difficult to make connections and to maintain the ones I've made. Lots of ghosting and uninteresting messaging happening. It can take a toll on ones motivation and confidence and I've found myself frequently taking a break from the whole thing. 

If and when you decide to take a break, do you keep your account active, or delete the whole thing? Since the Spring I have created and deleted about 5 or 6 times and it seems that every time I start a new account, I get fewer and fewer matches or connections. Not sure if that is something up with the app (algorithm), or if the dating pool is so small here that there just aren't that many new accounts.

Anyway, I am curious what your... strategies? (for lack of a better word) are with regards to taking a break from the apps.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pcwuqo/taking_breaks_from_old/

10,pd250m,1630120318,Has anyone ever been in a realtionship with a person who suffered from Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD)?,"Tl:DR:  I was pretty sure I was involved with some who suffers from HPD and it really screwed me up and I'm a emotional wreck  Therapy is going to take sometime, but im pretty sure I'm scarred for life..

Looking back I'm pretty sure my ex was text book HPD. 

She was very seductive, always needed to be the center of attention, controlling, manipulative, didn't have relationships with women and all here close relationships were with men who she met online, very vague when talking about things in her life that required details, dramatic, and cared more about the opinions of others outside our relationship than my thoughts and feelings when we had our issues.  From what I learned,  her previous relationships ended either because of cheating or because she was bored and sex was used to ensnare me into her 

When I asserted my boundaries or put some physical distance between us, she acted very dramatically, and usually she used her charm and sex to win me back. She told me she loved me after our last break-up and got upset when I told her I could never love her and proceeded to tell me about the scores of men who wanted her on dating apps.  That was pretty much the last straw for me and I left. 

Now I'm a shell of myself and my therapist even mentioned that the guy sitting in front of her wasn't the same guy who walked into her office 3 months ago (before I met her). 

I'm anxious all the time and even had had suicide attempt when she broke up with me for a few days  I thought she was normal and that I was the crazy one
because I wouldn't put up with her BS and people that knew the 2 of us would always take her side. Medications have helped to some degree but I'm a fucking wreck.  

While I feel validated by one of my therapist friends that I wasn't the ""crazy"" one in the relationship. I lost friends in the process.  I'm am definitely no contact with her and and plan to take a break from dating until I feel I'm ready to get back out there, which make take months or years of therapy. 

Having been in 2 emotionally manipulative relations I feel.like I'm a magnet for these type.of women and it will take time to break the cycle.

16,pdf162,1630174886,"How to start a long distance relationship, especially the first date?","I’m over-thinking a first date with someone coming to meet me from out of town and need advice! Do I (39/F) pick him (43/M) up from the airport? Do I treat him for all our meals because he is paying for his flight and hotel? Do I treat it like a normal first date, or something more because we have been talking and video chatting for a few weeks? See more below…

Matched with someone on OLD who was passing through. I rarely write to such matches, but I really liked his profile and didn’t expect him to respond. But he did, and chatting was fun and easy. He suggested talking on the phone, which went well, then FaceTime, also great. I started to hesitate because a long-term, permanent relationship, which we both want, seemed impossible with the distance and our respective commitments. But then he suggested we meet once just to see, and he’d come to me (2.5-hour plane ride). We’ve already discussed that he’d move for the right relationship, but not for 2 years until his son goes to college, and I would possibly move but not for a couple years myself until I accomplished a few more things at work.

He’s coming in a week. He booked his flight and hotel for the weekend. I’m trying very hard to live in the moment and see it as a fun weekend that might be nothing else. We both agreed that if we don’t have a connection on the first evening he’s here, no hard feelings and he will explore the city on his own. 

Do I pick him up from the airport when he arrives?. If not, do I pick him up from his hotel or have him meet me somewhere for dinner? 

If we do spend more than the first evening together, should I offer to pay for our dates the rest of the weekend since he came to see me? I would naturally offer to split on the first date, and insist on doing so if I know I don’t like the person and don’t want see him again, but will allow someone to pay if he insists the first time and then treat on a subsequent dates. But what should I do here? Should I get him a gift? (We’ve talked about my veggie and flower garden, was thinking a bouquet for his hotel room from my garden and some cherry tomatoes for a snack, which me mentioned he loves). Is that too much since it is a first date? (An OLD date once got me flowers at the first date, and it turned me off, but we had only texted for a couple of days before meeting and I thought it was more a meet and greet than a date so it made me uncomfortable. But then another OLD date where we had texted for longer and talked on the phone had gotten me some chocolate on a first date, after we had discussed the kind of chocolate we both like, and I actually thought it was really nice and thoughtful. But we had talked quite a bit before we first met...) 

I do like this guy, but I’m not holding my breath. I would be very happy if we did have a good connection and we wanted to try to date, but fine if it didn’t work out.

20,pdk6i1,1630192847,"Divorced people (men and women) who went through an ugly divorce where money shouldn't have been an issue, but was the ONLY issue - how has it changed you going forward?","tldr, do you work less so you can pay your ex less in spousal support post divorce?

Backstory time!

When I was married, I was the sole breadwinner of the household for all but about three of the 17 years I was with my ex.  We had no children and were SINKS or DINKS (single/double income no kids) and had built an small retirement portfolio and a fancy house and didn't really want for anything, even though my ex went to school full time for 13 of those years.  We pulled it off because I'm pretty shrewd and at the time, I was really really into working.  60 hour weeks most weeks and 100 sometimes.  A month after my ex got employed after her last credential, she kicked me out and I had to face down her infidelity and our marriage was over.

We had a comfortable life.  But, to save a lot of detail, I don't want to really disclose, the divorce made it impossible for me to continue  that old life and I had to completely start over.  I mean, start over.  My divorce was so contentious (I have a similar name as my father, and had my own related business, plus did work for my parents company) it strained my relationship with my parents so bad they sold out and I haven't spoken with them in many years.  My family had been very close and I usually had Thanksgiving at my home for 40+ people.

But my life is different now post divorce - most importantly, a new business that has zero assets and it's all my labor where I have a small bespoke clientele and I stop taking customers when I get to a certain $ threshold.  That threshold is set by my ex, who has a job where her salary is publicly discoverable.  I refuse to make a penny over that because making less than her is an affirmative defense in family court against spousal support.

My divorce consumed my half of my accumulated equity (in legal fees to get rid of my ex who was representing herself per se and creating a lot of havoc)  and she got hers - which she deserved.  I'm totally okay with that.  But in my state she has lifetime recourse to come back for support because of the length of time we were married.  That causes me no small amount of anxiety.  So nowadays, I usually work a short three days a week and take it easy the rest of the time.  Enjoying my really wonderful life I've created.  But -frankly - a little bored because I really enjoyed it when I had 600 employees and a company that did $150M in revenue a year to look after.  

And I didn't mind my ex being in my wallet when we were married, but man did my opinion of her change in the three years it took to divorce her.  Somehow she expected me to continue to work like a dog and front a lifestyle for her - and me not be a part of it.  Yeah, no.  I mean, no.  You can figure it out yourself with your wallet.  You can't have mine anymore.

So, I know I'm not the only one who has this problem because I know lots of WOMEN who had to pay spousal support to the husband post divorce.   Except I got around it by making less and lowering my lifestyle.  So this isn't a sexist thing.  It's an spousal support thing.

And that's my question?  Am I the only one who does this?  Or did you make compromises that maximize your potential (it doesn't just have to be income, you could do it for visitation or any host of other reasons) did you take on as a result of your divorce?

While he was treating me, he’s complained over time about his wife and tells me when she’s away and he finally gets to be alone in the house, over time has said things like I’m beautiful and an incredible person. Then he kept asking about my divorce and the details of it like how expensive was it, who to use, any advice like that (he knows many people, don’t know why he had to ask me). Anyway, so back in June my boyfriend proposed and he gasped and his face sunk and he said he thought I was breaking up with him. Then I showed him how he accidentally went down on both knees without thinking and he joked saying who wouldn’t want to go on both knees for you. 

Fast forward a couple months, he seemed to back off a bit but the compliments still came sometimes. He mentions random stuff like he’s financially comfortable, the reason I’m stressed is because I “decided to get engaged”, shows off his assets but in a fun way, not annoying or anything lol. He knows now I’m having second thoughts about my fiancé because he has a dark side that doesn’t seem to be getting better. I asked about his divorce and he said he’s going through it now but I’m the only one he’s told about it. 

My friend is worried he’s just trying to get in my pants (says it doesn’t matter he’s in his early 60s), but I’ve been in denial for a while over how I feel about him and it sucks. I don’t know how I should approach him to see what his intentions are with me. What’s your advice with that? And do you think it sounds like he has legit feelings?

26,pdpbcd,1630214102,2 year update,"I did an update a few years ago now. A few months after I got on. I have been back on for a while so thought I would share what I have learned. M50. Covid evaporated a bunch of time so it’s not really 2 years. 
Please remember I  am writing from the male perspective. I know it may not be the same as the female perspective In some regards though I think there will be overlap. 
I have been on about 45+ first dates. Lots of second and 3rd. 2, 3month relationships with really great people. 
 
Things I’ve learned

- need to be nimble in terms of dating sites. 
started with Ok and match. Now I find far more people on bumble and hinge. 
- other people are working their own program. Don’t be offended if you get dropped from conversation. It happens to everyone. Don’t unmatch. People try something serious for date 5,6,7 and then come back. It’s not personal. None of it is. 
- I have more success with women 43-46 versus women 48-51.  not sure why. I am not sure if motivation is as high. Even on dates older ladies seem to be more “whatever” like wondering why they have to do this.
-guys say you love dogs in your profile. I would say 80% of women post with their dogs. 
-this applies to everyone. Conversations can’t be one sided. I can’t be asking all the questions. I lose interest. I try to show interest but when I get nothing back, no matter how great you look in your profile I just move on. 
-I think the sooner a date happens it works to be a big advantage. Subsequent communication goes smoother if the date goes well. Call it a first mover advantage. 
- as much as it seems like a good idea don’t have sex on date 2. You don’t know if you like the person and you end up in instant commitment. Or it does with me…. Then on date 4 it’s not a match. 🤦🏻‍♂️
- people overstate in their profiles so don’t be intimated. A high percentage say they are fit/athletic. That doesn’t really match up with what we see in real life. Which is fine but people are putting their best foot forward. The same thing with travel, people make it sound like they travel six months of the year. The average person probably gets no more than three weeks paid time off.  My point is don’t be intimidated don’t sell yourself short because they are up selling.  
-One thing I have bumped up against is people who are are separated or very very recently divorced. They say that they have their life all sorted out but often times, especially with kids they don’t really. There is still drama trying to get things sorted out with the kids in the ex. It’s pretty normal I think. I went through it with my kids early days. Sometimes I didn’t wanna go to their moms so I had to take them which may dating really complicated an unpredictable so I think it’s fair someone’s only been separated for seven months to tell them that you’ll like them but maybe come back in another another7 months. 
- respond reasonably quick if messaged. I know it’s not always possible. However, the faster communication happens it’s just another fruit first mover advantage. People that takes six days to reply to your initial question or comment kind of fall off for one reason or the other. I appreciate you may be busy but honestly I don’t think it takes that long to send a quick message. 

Observations

-if you are taking photos in your bedroom please make your bed that applies both males and females. Same with the bathroom just make sure the countertops are clean and tidy not crap everywhere. I know that’s a bit judgy but I’m just being honest I’ve heard it from lots of other people as well that it’s gross if your place looks cluttered and messy
-if you are taking pictures and you’re using older ones make sure they don’t have a wedding ring on, it creates a lot of confusion.
-with some rare exceptions there may be an age where bathing suit photos don’t work unless you’re playing beach volleyball or some thing. Idk…..
-Guys, I hear women constantly tell me that they’re not interested in pictures of you with your fish or your latest kill hunting, just a thought. 
-I know it’s been discussed before. But putting what you don’t want in somebody comes across really negatively better to talk about the things that you do want. I know things like smoking drug use alcoholism or all non-negotiables however I’m not sure those need to be in your profile. It starts pointing to some of your past experiences which should be brought up I’m just not sure that’s the place for them. I could be entirely wrong on this but when I read profiles like this I usually move past them. Maybe it’s just me. 
-I think it’s important to remember that  career matters in terms of matches.

I tried it again in April this year, dated a few guys but for me there was nothing romantic developing. Three weeks ago I decided I need to refocus on me, so deleted my profiles.

But then not long after, within days, I missed matching/talking to people. Got the fear of missing on and an irrational concept that 'he' might be out there right now and I may be missing my chance.
It's absurd really.

44,pe2ww8,1630268486,Groundhogs Day in OLD.,"TL;DR: I keep meeting the same version of woman and it's freaking me out.

For context, I (48M) have been divorced and dating for three years. In that time, I have really liked 3 people (one was short-lived as she went back to her Ex) and the other two were relationships of some duration (6 mos. and 9 mos., respectively).

The two relationships and the two women both had a lot of similarities, an eery amount. Both experienced a significant amount of childhood trauma with turbulent upbringings, and had some Dad issues, both had challenging Ex situations that were allegedly the guys fault, both had moved about 45 minutes from a small town into the city, both had gotten to a reasonably objective level of professional success and stability for their kids,, both were very spiritual, Yoga/namaste/astrology types and very vested in personal improvement, both wanted to write a book to tell their story to empower other women, both were fresh out of their previous circumstances, both were very sexual and forthright about their appetite, etc., etc. The list goes on and on.

I just had a first lunch/brunch date with a 3rd woman that had childhood trauma, challenging Ex situation, reasonably successful, spiritual, that wants to write a book. 

Seriously, I am like what is happening here? Is there a glitch in the matrix? To be fair to the women, I am pretty high EQ for a man, an adult child of an alcoholic (which presents consistent patterns), and I present myself pretty well physically and conversationally.

Perhaps this is an irrelevant detail, but I found it a bit odd that he arrived early, sat down and ordered himself a coke then messaged me to say he was “in the back.” Even though I was a couple minutes early, I then had to walk around and guess which lone white guy he was (guy #3). At the point of receiving that text my anxiety flared and I briefly considered walking away. I didn’t because I am curious about people.

51,peaks5,1630296212,What to do with my online/phone flirtation,"I’m (37F) at the tail end of a LTR (not married) with a man, and we have a young child. We’re still living in the same house, wrapping up financial investments &amp; trying to be civil while we complete a joint business venture. We’ll be done with one of us moved out of our home by the end of September. This breakup has been a longtime in the works but we put it off and played family, as we were too tied up together and slowly separating things.

(Just giving context for the next part so I don’t sound like a cheater)

Completely by accident I met a man (46M) on an anonymous website. We spent months chatting here &amp; there and had endless things in common. He approached me with a private message and shared his photo. We started talking through text and on the phone, and after about 3 months we’ve logged hundreds of hours of talking &amp; chatting.

He knows my full real scenario. (So does the man I live with). I’m not lying or hiding anything. He told me at the outset that he wasn’t interested in rushing into anything &amp; had decided to be friends with the next woman he dated for months &amp; maybe even up to a year.

He has floated eventually meeting in a certain place, that we originally bonded over being interested in. Kind of a romantic thing I thought. I said probably not until next year so I can move on from my current life properly.

Things have gone faster than I thought and I’m going to be a free &amp; clear single woman soon. We’ve started talking about meeting for reals &amp; actually making plans for about 6wks from now.

But he’s started to seem distant. I notice I’m always texting first. He keeps talking about the trip we’ll take and saying “oh I’m always looking for an activity partner” and very clearly stated that he’s not interested in my looks (he’s seen dozens of photos of me, and when we’ve spoken on FaceTime he tells me I’m so gorgeous). And now he’s a bit less responsive and only wants to talk on the phone late at night when he’s high.

And I’ll think he’s not interested anymore, but then the next time we speak he will be very flirtatious again and I’m just confused.

I’ve never “dated” a man over 30. The “dating” phase of my last relationship, the guy was 27 when we got together.

Guys over 40—what’s going on?

Is he still interested? Is he backing off &amp; I need to back off? I’m very interested in him (in the most realistic of ways) so is there something I can do (or stop doing) to get him more interested?

He's always been my ABSOLUTE favorite celebrity chef and I was devastated when he committed suicide.  HBO is coming out with a new documentary called Roadrunner so I decided to finally read his book as I never read any of them.  One of the things I loved about him was what a fascinating and amazing storyteller he was.  I felt like I could die happy sitting happily at his feet listening to him just tell stories all day.

For the first time in my dating life (if you could call it that since I stopped during covid haha) it finally dawned on me that passionate people are really what make my heart sing because I felt truly happy reading his words and hearing his stories and realized I want more of that.  There are other things I like as well like intelligence and ambition but passion is REALLY where that inexplicable feeling of fascination comes from with me.  

I am a big believer that we have to be the type of person to attract those that we want.  Pre Covid I was.  I was flashy, sexy, passionate and filled with a natural curiosity.  Reading that book made me realize I no long am any of those things and kinda just go about my day and then go to sleep.  If you are passionate how do you keep that going through Covid?  If you used to be and have felt it wane how do you get your groove back so to speak?

72,pevhye,1630371891,Do you feel like maybe there's more out there?,"Sorry if this is all over the place but that's how my mind is flowing right now. How do you get over feeling like maybe there's someone better out there but then at the same time you feel like you'd be passing on something wonderful with the person you are with? 

For context: I was in a relationship then married to my ex-husband for 16 years. Then I took two years for myself after the divorce. Now I'm in a relationship with a great guy for 5 months. He was only the second guy I met from OLD so I've never ""played the field."" And while he's amazing and thinks the world of me, I'm starting to notice some little quirks that give me pause. Not red flags... Just oddities about being extremely germophobic. I've always classified myself as a germophobe but this has me beat. I know I'm not perfect.... No one is. I didn't really think about it until the possibility of a cross country move came up for his career and he asked if I'd consider moving with him (I said no... I'm happy with my career and I have kids that I can't just uproot and again... we've only been dating 5 months). It would make me sad if he moved but I would be so happy for him with the opportunity it would open for him. Am I just finding things to question because I'm scared of commitment? Or am I'm walling up my heart so it won't hurt so bad in anticipation that he moves? It has me thinking that even though he is amazing and treats me like a queen, that maybe I'd be settling by living with these quirks. Would I find someone less obsessive with germs but then have some other quirk that's more annoying? Or maybe I would I never find anyone else at all? 

Also, another part of me doesn't want to leave my job... I don't see myself ever wanting to leave it until I retire which is at least 25+ years away. He was ready to buy a house here (not with me or because of me... We aren't moving that fast... But because he likes where we live and wanted to put down roots) and then this opportunity came up. So what if we continue in a relationship/possibly marriage and this comes up again about a relocation? I know relationships are about compromise and we talked about this scenario in the very beginning of dating but I guess I never expected it to be a possibility so soon. He said it would be something we make a decision on together and he's not looking for someone to just blindly follow him.... But I feel selfish for not even wanting to entertain the idea in the future.

Been chatting casually almost daily until the messages became way more frequent, a bit flirty, and we started toying with the idea of going out. Finally, a date was proposed for last Saturday. 
I was not really keen on meeting him as i did not really know anything about him - all our chats were about the hobby. So i said it will actualy not be a date ""date"", yet we agreed to go to the bar we both liked.
Day arrives, i rock up at the venue, cannot find him. Text - messages not read. Send a message after 25 minutes that I've left. After half an hour a receive a text from him that he finally rocked up at the venue... said to him that i was not willing to wait that long for anybody, thanked him for a chat and said goodbye. He responded, but no reason for being late, no sincere apology, nothing. 

I always stick to my rule of meeting guys as soon as possible. Made an exception in this case, and regret it now. Anyways, back to the drawing board.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pf5ze8/well_that_was_a_disappointment/

I have bad anxiety, ADHD, and am one of those lucky folks with an anxious/avoidant attachment style, particularly with romantic relationships. I have been in therapy for years and have made great progress - friendships are much easier now, and I'm more secure than I've ever been. 

But romantic relationships still remain a challenge. I used to completely shut down when problems arose but have become more comfortable with communicating around challenges. I can be a bit of an emotional rollercoaster as emotional regulation is hard for me due to the ADHD. The good news is that I can go from sad to happy in like 10 minutes or less. I used to need a lot of reassurance but now I'm more comfortable with less - basically, send me the occasional ""good morning"" or ""I'm thinking about you text"" and help with planning dates and I'm mostly good. I say mostly as I am sure there are times when I need more reassurance, and I still have difficulty with expressing wants and needs. This is an area I am definitely still working on and have made some improvements, but have a long way to go. Oh, and trust is a big issue for me - I have been working on opening up with people (romantic and platonic) but it's scary as hell and if something bad happens I retreat in to my brain cave. 

The catch-22 is that practice makes perfect, but as I said romantic relationships remain hard - and elusive - so I don't really get any practice in.

79,pf92fx,1630426451,I'm starting the process to adopt a teenage girl and reckoning with making myself un-datable.,"Ten years ago when I was still married, I decided not to have biological children and started thinking about fostering or adopting an older child. I don't have the baby drive but I connect easily with older children. 

I didn't know I'd end up leaving my ex. It's been 5 years since then (final for 4) and I've done the work on myself. My life is solid, but healing has been a higher priority than dating. I'm very social so I meet lots of men, but no real prospects. And that's okay. 

I always pictured fostering/adopting as something I'd do with a partner. But as much as I'd love to fall in love, I've gotten pretty comfortable alone. I started to think.... why would I put finding a partner as a prerequisite? Fostering/adoption is more meaningful to me than the dim hope of romantic love that may never happen anyway.

So I'm going forward. And I'm really excited! It'll be a while until I'm approved, but I'm getting things ready. The room is coming together nicely. I'm reading and learning. I don't know who this girl is yet but I already feel love towards her. 

I also get that I'm making a choice. I know that I'm a catch and that becoming a single parent won't make me any less of a catch, but for a while I will be completely un-datable. Men practically recoil when I tell them my plans. Kind of funny to watch their gymnastics to get away from me. (Not bashing men. I know this is a lot.)

So I guess I'm just kind of processing that part of my choice. Giving up on dating. I still hoped I'd find love.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pf92fx/im_starting_the_process_to_adopt_a_teenage_girl/
80,pf9727,1630426838,Advice for Dating a Single Dad - how patient should I be?,"\*\*\*Struggling with how patient I need to be w busy Dad vs having my own needs met. \*\*\*

I (40 F) have been dating a single father (40 M) for nearly a year. We are long distance (several hours drive) and overall have a wonderful relationship - we laugh, have great physical and intellectual connection, mutually supportive of one another's busy careers, we both treat each other well and respectfully, we get along with one another's friends.  I care for and admire him deeply. Our ""honeymoon"" phase was hot and heavy and we developed a bond very quickly. The past few months we've been struggling with logistics and intimacy, which has caused me to feel a bit distant and insecure. Now that it's post lockdown our lives are getting busier and he seems to have less time for me though he still makes effort to drive to see me every couple weeks. We went from seeing each other every week, now to every 2-3 weeks. But lately he's always exhausted, after dinner he just wants to sleep and in the morning he wants to sleep in, so our intimacy is lacking (went from the best sex I've ever had to average). We also have gone from talking multiple times a day to talking multiple times a week. Overall, I feel our relationship has lessened across a number of categories and he's putting in significantly less effort. He says that we are just transitioning out of the honeymoon phase into something more comfortable and that in general he's a lot busier than I am (being a single father). This is not untrue but I'm still struggling and feeling my needs aren't being met. I am not the type of woman who needs to be with or talk to my man all the time, I'm pretty independent. But being long distance is complicated, our calls are all we have, it's the only way we can maintain a connection and be part of each other's lives.

The other challenge I have is I haven't formally met his child (4 years old, who he has 50/50 custody), which can feel painful at times as I feel disconnected from the most important part of his life. We met briefly 6 months ago and it made me so happy, I just fell deeper in love with both of them. But based on the separation agreement with his ex I can't spend time with their child until I meet with his ex. I facetime with him and his child occasionally but he has expressed he's not ready to make a formal introduction (i.e. start spending regular time together), mainly bc of the bad relationship with his ex (he feels she might lash out and cause problems) but more importantly, he just doesn't feel ready. I understand this is a big step, so I'm trying to be patient. But it's been almost a year and he has not expressed much empathy or understanding for the position I'm in (I have tried to explain how this makes me feel multiple times but I'm met mostly with defensiveness). And with all the factors I've mentioned above my insecurities are starting to get the better of me and I'm left wondering if perhaps he just doesn't have space or energy for me in his life, and if he's still unsure of me/us after 10 months of dating is that a red flag? He seems content with our situation but I feel I need a little more and it doesn't seem like he can give more at this time.

I don't want to lose what we have bc I think we have a great connection and could see creating a future together. I should also add he has mentioned having kids and marriage with me - obviously I am 40 so having children is tricky but something I'd love to share with him. I'm trying to figure out how patient I should be w a busy single dad, what's reasonable to request of him and if I need to be more assertive about what I need in our relationship.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pf9727/advice_for_dating_a_single_dad_how_patient_should/
81,pfaqu8,1630431411,"Reconnected with past love, why’s he freaking out now?","Last year, I reconnected with a man from my past that I haven’t seen or communicated with for more than 17 years. We weren’t in a defined relationship — we were best friends who did a lot of partying together in college and had a sexual relationship that lasted for the four years we were together. I always assumed I was more into him than he was me, as I wanted a real boyfriend-girlfriend relationship and never got it. He joined the military and after a few years, he was married. We never spoke after he left. It took years for me to stop thinking of him. He often crossed my mind, as a “What if…”

When we reconnected, our chats were sporadic and more focused on catching up. But the connection was still there. We would talk on the phone for hours. He would continuously say things like, “I wish you lived closer,” or “I’ve never forgotten about you.” He lives about 5 hours away now, and we started flirting with the idea of seeing each other, but one of us always backed out, and then he would go silent for weeks/months. In addition to the distance, our lives have turned out very different. I am career focused, never married and have no kids; he’s been married twice, has three kids and works a blue collar job. I’m not deterred by this at all, but our lifestyles are opposite.

Then, out of the blue, I receive a message from him saying he had been putting too much pressure on himself and that was why he’d been backing off. He told me he seriously wanted to see me, but not for sex. That he wanted to take me on a real date, get to know me again, and see what happened. I was taken aback at how forthcoming and earnest he seemed. I told him I loved that idea, and that we should plan something. True to form, I didn’t hear back from him until months later. His excuse was that he thought the conversation didn’t go well. I admit, I was shocked and probably didn’t immediately embrace what he said. It just wasn’t like him. But I was enthusiastic and very into the idea. 

Fast forward six months, after I’d reached out a few times with no response, and he reaches out to me. We chat via text for a few days, and eventually, have a three hour phone conversation. He confessed he’d always had strong feelings toward me. He brought back things from our past, and the memories he had were a little different than the way I remembered things. My self esteem at the time was very low, and hearing his side of things made me realize that the love I felt wasn’t really unrequited, I just wasn’t in a position to receive it. He invited me to visit for the weekend, and I made the spontaneous and uncharacteristic decision to drive to his town the next day for the weekend. 

It was magical. He did everything right. There were about ten minutes of awkwardness, but we immediately became so comfortable with each other. We drank coffee and watched the sunrise, went to brunch and walked around his town, dined at very nice restaurants where we shared bottles of wine and amazing conversation. He said it was the best date he’d ever had, and I wholeheartedly agreed. The sex was great; it was more loving and romantic than in the past. He was so kind and considerate, he looked at me like I was the woman of his dreams, he held my hand in the car, he kissed me on the forehead. I was sad to leave him to come home, but I was excited to see where things were headed. In all my years of dating, I finally was having the feeling I’d been chasing for so long. I had a strong premonition that he was the one.

Over the next few weeks, we exchanged messages, had a few short phone calls, but it was back to reality for both of us. Long days at work, his kids back in school, and he started slowly dropping off. After some drinks, I asked him why he was backing off. He didn’t answer, but a few days later, he told me he had a busy, not great week and apologized that he hadn’t had the time or energy to engage. I understood, and told him that I did want to talk soon. I wanted to establish some expectations for moving forward. I didn’t want him to think I was expecting constant contact, but I did expect consistency. I decided a once a week phone call and occasional texting was enough and hopefully would not be a strain on him as a hard working single dad. (he works a demanding job and takes on several side jobs in the hopes of launching his own business at the end of the year.) I planned to ask that we see each other every 4-6 weeks, and since I have fewer responsibilities at home and can work remotely, I was prepared to go to him more often than he came to me. I just wanted him to commit to making an effort and to take things day by day, visit by visit. 

I’ve been patiently waiting to talk, thinking I’d get my chance the next weekend he was without the kids. That was last weekend. I messaged him Saturday evening, we chatted back and forth about our week and day. 

Then, he says, “I don’t see any reason we should continue talking. We are different people with different lives. You couldn’t begin to understand what my life is like with the kids. Long distance sucks and I have too many variables. You are in a good place with a great career that you don’t need to leave, and I don’t want to see you throw it all away for this. It’s just irresponsible. It has nothing to do with you. We are just in different places and I see no reason to try this when I know I can’t make it work.”

I asked him if we could talk, that I thought he was borrowing problems and worried about things that hadn’t even happened yet. I work in higher ed, and I didn’t share this because I didn’t want him to think I was moving too fast, but he lives very close to two universities where I have great contacts and am confident I could land a great job — probably even a better one than I currently have — if I was patient. But realistically, that is at least a year down the road. I told him that I deserved the opportunity to make my own decision about my future, and that he should respect me enough to at least hear my side or give me his over the phone. Not in short messages. The conversation ended, I could see I wasn’t getting anywhere.

His last relationship was not great, and I know he is very apprehensive about being hurt like that again. Ever since we first reconnected, he has had a sadness about him. Almost like he wasn’t fulfilled and is lonely, but he had accepted being alone and putting his kids first. 

I messaged him the next day and asked if I could call him that night to talk. He replied and said his son was spending the night, and that the next day would be better. I messaged him the next day, saying I would call at a certain time, and to let me know if that wasn’t good for him. No reply, so I called at the mentioned time. No answer. I called again an hour later. No answer. 

I am heartbroken. I feel so strongly that we are meant to be together, but even if we aren’t, I deserve an opportunity to share my feelings and I deserve a conversation. I know it will be a hard talk, but we are adults. 

I’m planning to let this rest for a week or so, and then reach back out. To be clear, I wouldn’t do this for someone else. It’s the history and the connection that compels me to act.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pfaqu8/reconnected_with_past_love_whys_he_freaking_out/

His last relationship was not great, and I know he is very apprehensive about being hurt like that again. Ever since we first reconnected, he has had a sadness about him. Almost like he wasn’t fulfilled and is lonely, but he had accepted being alone and putting his kids first. 

I messaged him the next day and asked if I could call him that night to talk. He replied and said his son was spending the night, and that the next day would be better. I messaged him the next day, saying I would call at a certain time, and to let me know if that wasn’t good for him. No reply, so I called at the mentioned time. No answer. I called again an hour later. No answer. 

I am heartbroken. I feel so strongly that we are meant to be together, but even if we aren’t, I deserve an opportunity to share my feelings and I deserve a conversation. I know it will be a hard talk, but we are adults. 

I’m planning to let this rest for a week or so, and then reach back out. To be clear, I wouldn’t do this for someone else. It’s the history and the connection that compels me to act.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pfavsp/reconnected_with_a_past_love_whys_he_freaking_out/

84,pfb59t,1630432638,Love at first sight,"At the beginning of COVID in May of 2020 I met the ONE,  the nicest person I have ever met.  I have not ever felt this way about anyone my whole 51 years of life.  I decided I wanted them to come back after meeting them and asked them if they are single and ""yes I am single"" they said.  So later that night I texted and told them that ""I want to have sex with you"" only because I wanted to see them again, it happened but not right away, took maybe 2 weeks for them to reply.  We have been having sex for a year and 4 months and I still feel the same about them as I did in the beginning if not more I have not confessed my true feelings to them and now they are sick with the virus!  I am crushed, COVID is real, and is ruining our community.  please be aware that having the shot or not we are all in danger of getting sick.  My Lover is fighting for their life right now and I should have told them the truth about how I feel. I love you and when you get better I will shower you in joy and love! Please be strong, you can do this, I will be right here and waiting.

85,pfcbwd,1630436219,Just some world-wide solo traveling observations from a 48M,"I just returned from a 2 week trip to Belgium and Holland, where I had an amazing time. Yes, lots of food, beer, walking, gas station sandwiches, the works. I saw the window of travel open up and took a chance on a cool country. Glad I did.  

But I noticed some things that might help some of you along the way. Or you disagree with. Either way, it's ok.   First off, this is a comparison between the PNW and Europe...which us Pacific Northwesterners don't really dress up too much. Europeans put a little more effort into even their daily appearance.  Not really over the top...well, there were some exceptions to that rule on both men and women.  But the biggest takeaway I got from the direct comparison is that it only takes (at least for a short haired guy like me) a little effort to dress better. I didn't feel I had to wear a fancy sweater tied around my shoulders, but a button up shirt instead of a t shirt and some casual shoes (like pumas, etc..) was a good compromise for the environment. I don't think I'll be joining the skin tight jorts or peg legging jeans camp anytime soon, but here's your fashion forward warning. I won't give any women's fashion advice here, since I can say that picking out clothing for myself was a stressful enough of an endeavor, but I appreciated how (again, a PNW and a guy's perspective) simply it seemed the women were able to dress and still looked nice. 

I didn't go out with the intention of intimacy, and I certainly didn't find any while I was there (I think the stories of traveling hookups are 95% made up anyway), just to get that out of the way.  But I have gone out for years in my area and not made acquaintances as easily as I did there. I ended up every night I wanted some companionship, I found people to hang out with. Whether it was the Dutch women I ended up playing cards with at the bar, the Belgian woman that I complimented and ended up drinking beers with her and her friends 2 nights during my trip, the Brazilian guys that I ended up bar-hopping with, or the odd Belgian guy who had a watch fetish and a few too many drinks, I was really surprised at how easy it was to strike conversations and have friendly company nearly every night of my trip. I wish friendships were that easy to start here in the PNW.  My takeaway is that I can meet people, even though I get in my own head sometimes, and maybe I just live in the wrong area of the country/state to meet people. 

Traveling solo is great. And it sucks. You experience tons of things that you can only share in photos. Noone to share in the awe of the situation, or tell you later how cool something was, or how much it sucked. I still wouldn't have skipped the trip.  I got out of my comfort zone and experienced a whole new country and people, and came back knowing that I need to dress a &lt;little&gt; better when I go out for an evening dinner or to grab a drink, esp. since as a guy it doesn't take much (at least here) to make a decent improvement.  And, even as a lego guy shaped human, I'm still decent enough looking to have people open to talking with me as a stranger, even if that is 4000 miles away. It might not sound like a confidence boost, but it is.  

So, with the fall/winter season coming,(yes, I know, it's only September) and what feels like the door slowly closing on the dating season, I have some really good memories and experiences to keep me warm through the cold, rainy season here. Not the same as an affectionate, compatible human...but maybe once the spring arrives, so will a new group of people that I can meet and expand my circle with.  Do something a little dangerous or scary every so often, it's really good for you.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pfcbwd/just_some_worldwide_solo_traveling_observations/
86,pfcrc3,1630437482,Bring the dog to the date or not....,"So I've been chatting with this really nice guy for several weeks. Yeah, we're falling into the pen pal trap. I'm out of country for another month.
Anyhow. I do plan on meeting him when I make it back. Finally.

Thing is, we sort of connected over having dogs. &amp; we both love hiking. I'm thinking it would be logical to ask him out on a hike, but since my dog is a bit of an a$$, I see nothing but trouble brewing there (a day of managing my dog, and his issues, not actually interacting with each other). But not bringing him would seem like I am hiding him away and would also feel wrong somehow... (besides, I sort of value his opinion of people, bit skewed as it may be.)

Safer to go with a coffee date? There it would be easy to explain not bringing the mutt. But then I'd be sitting there with someone whom I've literally talked about everything with already, so I think it would be strange... besides, he doesn't drink coffee (still debating how much of a character flaw I consider that :-p ).

What do you think? Is the dog the ultimate test, or should I save that encounter for a bit further down the road?

&amp;nbsp;

Yeah, when it gets down to planning things I'll probably just ask the guy how he feels about meeting my *lovely* companion.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pfcrc3/bring_the_dog_to_the_date_or_not/

96,pfmuk5,1630471881,I am so confused.,"I would really appreciate some outside perspective on a first date I just had. 

We had been texting daily on an app for the last week or so. He asked me out, I accepted. We negotiated a place. I was early, he was on time. We sat and chatted for about 2 1/2 hours - both of us laughing and sharing... it felt comfortable and although neither of us were being overtly flirtatious it felt like we liked each other and things were going well. 

Then, suddenly he says that it's time for him to head home. Like, I had no indication that we were wrapping things up. So I get up and say that I need to cash out at the bar and he says something like, let's do this again and gives me a hug and then disappears. 

I went and cashed out and walked back to my car and drove home feeling absolutely confused. It felt like our conversation was flowing smoothly, there were no weird hiccups. I really don't get it. I would normally have expected this to end with him waiting for me to cash out to walk me to my car and then perhaps a nice text when he got home to say it was nice to meet or something. I'm not oblivious, I would have picked up on the 'no chemistry' or 'bad vibes' feelings, I think. 

I know you all weren't there and can't read his mind... but I'm so confused. Any idea about what might be happening here? As it is now I'm trying not to take it personally and waiting to see if he contacts me again.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/pfmuk5/i_am_so_confused/
