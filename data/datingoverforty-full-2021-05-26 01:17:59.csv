Hi all! Many of you asked me to follow up after taking advice to deal with a guy who was sending me frequent low-quality texts right after we matched. 

We talked on the phone and had easy conversations and I didn’t pick up any red flags. When I told him my preference about texting less, he seemed understanding and backed off for a couple of days. 

Then he ramped back up and started love bombing me with messages about how excited he was about our date. 

He canceled our date at the last minute on Sunday with a story about needing to help his young nephew who recently lost his dad. I should have just blocked and deleted, but the story seemed plausible so I offered him a chance to make it up.

We made dinner plans tonight and texted for hours on Monday and Tuesday. Really covered all kinds of ground and seemed to have tons of interests and attitudes in common. He kept telling me how he wanted to give me a big hug and kiss me, though. Which made me feel uncomfortable enough to ask him to cool it.

This morning he texted me before 7am to say good morning. And I told him I needed to stay off my phone to get some things done since I had spent so much time texting with him the last two days. He kept on texting me about the date and the kissing though. And I started to dread the date. 

When he showed up he was really attractive like in his photos and we walked to a restaurant about a half mile away. He talked about himself throughout dinner and didn’t pull out my chair for me, even though I stood there waiting for him to do so.

We walked back to my neighborhood where he had parked and I kissed him goodbye. It was a nice kiss. But before I had gotten back in the house he texted me that he had a hard time controlling himself. We had made a second date and I told him I found him attractive but wanted to get to know him better before we got much more physical.

He told me I had already gotten to know him and had been giving him different signals with our texting. 

I texted back that I was sorry I had given him the wrong impression and didn’t intent to waste his time or mine. Then I blocked him and deleted our match online. 

So back to the drawing board for me. I feel good about going through the experience this week because I really learned that when I feel irritated or unsure right off the bat, I should listen to my instincts.

Met this guy at my apt complex dog park. Had some good conversations that weren't just about the dogs. Saw him three times when we were the only ones there. I thought there was a connection. We were just hanging out and out of the blue he says he has to go and quickly leaves. 

Next time I see him there are a bunch of people there and I start talking to a guy I have known for three years while this other guy is hanging out away from every one else. I made a point out of saying hi and he was really distant. I just went and hung out with other neighbors and met a woman I really hit it off with. As a friend, I'm straight. 

So then the next time he was still stand offish but then asks if I've been vaccinated? I talked to him and another woman about vaccinations and going back to the office etc. He also said that he was moving to a rental house and looked sad. 

Then Saturday I was at the pool sitting on a lounge chair minding my own business looking down at my phone and I see him walk by out of the corner of my eye. He sits down three chairs away, goes and puts his feet in the water and gets up and leaves after 5 minutes. 

What the hell? Am I missing some thing? Is he nuts? Who stays at the pool for 5 minutes? 

Saw him again yesterday and asked when he is moving because honestly its getting awkward. Not until the end of July. I said ""oh so I will see again"" and smiled awkwardly. I didn't tell him its awkward.

He is cute, a lot of fun, interesting,  successful. Did I mention he's cute?  Sounds great, right? But there is one small problem.  He
never texts!  I've tried to engage him in some written prose and instead of taking the bait, he calls me!  I almost didn't know what to do. I have been phone avoidant for YEARS!  I, who have had a long term dislike of talking on the phone, have now found myself picking up when he calls to hear his voice saying, ""Hey girl!"", as I involuntarily giggle like a 16 year old.

Who would have thought? 

For all those who have avoided the phone like I avoid carbs on keto, just know, it  might be because you haven't met someone who annoyingly enough,  didn't make it an option. This guy's texts were awful. Terrible! They were straight to the point. No embellishment whatsoever.   A maximum of 25 characters.  He is killing me over here!  BUT....I'm beginning to discover something really quite nice. He calls me at the same time every morning on his way to work while grabbing coffee.  We chat. It has become a welcome addition to my day. He calls me in the afternoon on his way home or in the evening while he's relaxing after cooking dinner. I've come to feel this sense of connection that I didn't feel while exchanging a  bazillion witty texts from the last guy I dated. There is this sense of consistency,  stability and comfort I never received from texts.  While I love the written word, I am beginning to realize I've allowed texts to take the place of the inflection and warmth of a man's voice. A bunch of words, no matter how satisfying they are to read and write, do not quite compare to the feeling I get when I answer the phone and I hear this man say, ""Hey girl"".

I have had many successful dates and a few very disappointing experiences... 

One thing important to mention is that I moved just before covid lockdown and did not have the opportunity to make friends or build a social circle. I am living by myself and as a result very bored and lonely. This is important as I feel it puts me in a disadvantaged position and may skew my behavior/ perception. 

Currently I am chatting with a (37m) considerably attractive, established, career oriented man (albeit younger than myself) and I am very confused by his behavior.

By virtue of the playful nature of our texts, we have seen each other several times in the past weeks, but always in a  spontaneous and quirky way ( to get a cookie from a batch I had baked not related to him; to try out the new shower head I had purchased). We have not had sex, or even kissed but the encounters do have an underlying sexual connotation.

While all this has been light and fun, it seems to be nothing beyond that; I mentioned that I was being to wonder if he was actually interested in me, and he assures me that he is but he is really busy and moves very slow.

Please let me know if the following sounds reasonable or like red flags:

- texting is generally reasonable, but takes a while to respond; will respond at very odd hours sometimes.

- is responsive but doesn't share much; will answer questions but rarely asks questions of me.

- Has been having issues sending / receiving texts. Seems he is not getting notifications of my texts and sometimes states 'why aren't my texts going through?'. I was starting to think he is just playing me, but the timing seems random and he continues to engage me after these incidences.

- while he is responsive during the week, he generally does not text on the weekends and seems to have a very busy social life.

- while trying to keep it light, my attempts to make plans and arrangements aren't going anywhere; he seems uninteresting in making time for me.

- when chatting casually / playfully (what should I bake next to lure you over, etc.), he will drop a 'just finishing up and I am out of here for a week'; then he goes radio silence.

- he is not very expressive and very hard to read; I did bring this up with him and he said that yes he is not expressive at all and he is aware of this.


I have been to his place twice and know he is truthful about his occupation and absolutely believe that he is busy.
And also believe that he has a full and previously established social life.

He is very attractive, successful, and increasingly interesting  as I learn more. Which frankly I was surprised by as I was being to think he was too pretty to be interesting.

Overall I am very attracted and intrigued, but wholly confused by his behavior. I can't help but think that he is just fucking with me.
But, I have never experienced a guy that wanted to take things slow and not try to get in my pants on the first date.....

So, does he sound legitimate or is he just entertaining himself at my expense?

TL;DR  I am looking for advice on if I am wasting my time with this person or if he may have genuine interest in me. His particular behaviour is foreign to me and therefore I am unsure if my typical interpretation is sound.
And, given living / being alone during the isolation of covid, I am having a hard time trusting my instincts.",True,False,False,datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,49144,public,self,Reasonable or Red Flags?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/nlvc7h/reasonable_or_red_flags/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In sharing this week, yet here is another time that has happened.  Moving forward: I'm going to kindly and flat out ask men to tell me their age and how old their photos are if the photos aren't dated. I keep mine within 3 months and date them on the caption. I think with this OLD it is reasonable at this point to be asking. 

Keep in mind I'm 44....
His profile said 55. 
His photos looked ok for that. 
He walked into the place, and I didn't even recognize him. He looked frail/much older. I did a double take but it took his introducing himself at the host stand to fully realize it was him. In the photos he looked bulky and much younger. As this wasn't a matter of photoshop being used. Now, if he had been recently ill and lost a lot of muscle mass/or weight, he did not mention. If that were me and would have been the case,  I would have been taking updated photos or at least said oh hey before we meet Fyi I may look a little leaner right now due to (fill in blank of illness or situation) as it is that obvious in his pics. Esp if say a person gained 15 pounds recently out of thr norm but historically the photos used is how they always look and they are working to get it off. I can see that maybe happening also. With explanation, that can be understandable. 

We were talking for some time, and then discussing ages of kids and hia college years etc. And I get him caught up where he said in a way that was not convincing how oh yeah, he is actually 59 but ..and here we go with this BS that we always here, ""the app messed up my birth date"". Right. 

Here is the thing, if you created an app and it ""messed up thr birthdate"", they do ask for you to verify/confirm it then you click to the next step. I had to do this, so the ""they messed up"" is BS as YOU are the one entering the info. You can also contact customer experience team to correct if it is example Match. You can also delete and start over since you hadn't gone too far down the road in creating your profile yet or on off chance you paid for a subscription and didn't want to mess that all up, at minimum write in profile about the error and actively work on getting it corrected. 

To show up on a date and then it takes my line of questioning to share how old they actually are is wrong. 59 is near 60 (and I think his birthday is coming up). (My mom is 65 example). 

I just can't imagine how put off a guy would be if he was in his 30s and I said I was 39 (and used younger photos) then showed up and he sees it doesn't add up that I'm 39 then I say oh, well, I'm actually about to be 45. And expect him to be ok with that.  Don't assume that a few extra years shouldn't be a big deal to someone that doesn't mind some bit of age gap. It's deceptive and making an assumption that isn't fair to the other person. 

I just had to share that for our wonderful Reddit Over 40, if anyone has thought of fudging their age. And I have been told some men do it to play the algorithm and get in front of younger women. Esp the 'I feel young for my age' crowd. Equally, some women do it if they feel they ""look young for their age' and want to be aure their profiles get in front of younger age brackets.

We both have busy lives, what with work and kids - I have 3 teenagers and he has 2 under 10.

I am a full time mum, though now my kids are older they are relatively self sufficient, he is a full on dad but has the kids in a rotation pattern meaning that he has every Wednesday and Thursday free and every other Friday, Saturday and Sunday free.

I mainly see him every Wednesday and then Friday night through to Sunday on his free weekends.  I also pop in for the occasional cup of coffee.

We’ve both met each other’s kids, had the occasional dinner etc, but our kids haven’t met each other.

We have connected on every single level and we both see each other as best friends and lovers.  I am 100% sure of how he feels about me.

So why am I thinking of walking away?!

I just don’t see enough off him!!

I’ve brought this up a few times, the last time being a couple of weeks ago.  I said I’m struggling with the amount that we see each other and the amount we communicate outside of seeing each other.  He said he was completely shocked by that, that he has no more of himself to give and that you only get one life and I should really think about what I want.

We chatted for a while and he said he doesn’t do well when he feels pressured, especially when there’s nothing he can do about the situation.  In the end I said his response made me angry and sad, but that I want him and us.

We had a really lovely weekend together, as well as more communicating about ourselves.

So since the restrictions have lifted (17th May UK) and his boys can now go back to their sports clubs, two Wednesday’s on the trot he has taken them to club.  The first Wednesday I went round after and then the second Wednesday (yesterday)I said I wouldn’t be coming round.  Then tomorrow what should be our Friday he is away with work and won’t be back until late.

I am spending Saturday and Sunday at his.

Wednesday is supposed to be his free day, and his ex should and would take the boys to club.  He already takes them to other clubs Monday’s and Tuesday’s, Saturday’s when he has them and Sunday’s every week.  I have already said I am struggling about lack of time, and now this is cutting into our time even more.

He is a wonderful dad and his boys are, quite rightly, his priority.  I feel so guilty about being annoyed that he is spending time with his boys.

But this is making me so sad at times.  I think my main issue is I know that there  is no room for manoeuvre on this.  As soon as I bring it up again, he will say again that life is too short to be unhappy and I should work out what I want.

He has never mislead me about his time, but lockdown has!  And maybe if I’d have realised this 14 months ago I wouldn’t have let this relationship go so deep.

I think I need to walk away, but I’m heartbroken.

I met someone on Hinge, we went on two dates, texted daily, which then slowed down, a relief actually because trying to keep up conversation can get kind of boring. I texted him today after two days of not hearing from him and he replied within a reasonable timeframe. Is this normal?

The last time I tried it, it was probably 10 years ago. I remember matching with a lot of women that seemed pretty fixated on a LTR or nothing. 

That's fine, but it's generally not how I find myself thinking. I generally just try to meet interesting people and let the relationship be what it may from there. 

Frankly, I don't really know how much I care about a LTR. It's great if it happens but I have no interest in seeking out a LTR just got the sake of an LTR. 

I kinda want to take my time, date around, see who's out there, and just enjoy meeting some new people. 

Do other people approach it this way on OLD? Is it well received?

How much of this should I share initially and/or on my profile? I don't want to over share, but I also don't want to waste mine or anybody else's time if they're in ""LTR or nothing"" mode.

So I (48f) have been single for about 8 or 9 years now. Before that for a number of years, it was a succession of casual relationships, fwb, dating etc, nothing that became too serious. But I very rarely went more than a year without some kind of sexual partner. 

&amp;#x200B;

I decided that I was totally done with casual sex, I just kept getting hurt over and over again. So I gave it up and decided I wouldn't have sex again until I found someone who wanted something a bit more serious, who wanted a real emotional connection. All these years later I still haven't found anyone who wants that with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I began to feel like there was something majorly wrong with me, so I have been through all the therapy, working on myself, all that kind of stuff. I have learnt that you can be the most amazing person on the planet, and still sometimes just be really unlucky in love. And that seems to be the case with me. I am happy with my life, got friends, hobbies, a job I love, my amazing fluffy dog of 14 years. 

I am happy with who I am as a person, I mean I am not perfect, I am overweight, have an addiction to chocolate, but generally I am pretty awesome. So I think my good points far outweigh any bad points I may have. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really miss being intimate, I miss kissing, cuddling, holding hands, sex, all that kind of stuff. I miss it so much it feels like I am mourning it. I am grieving a fulfilling and varied love and sex life. 

But I have kind of accepted and reconciled myself with the fact that I either have casual sex, or I don't have any. And I do not want to go back to casual, so I have to accept that I am celibate now, and have been for years. The last couple of years, I have accepted that from now on, unless a miracle happens, then it is self love only for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, recently I have started hanging out with someone that I am starting to have feelings for, there is links on my profile to posts I have made about him. But this post isn't really about him. Since hanging out with him, the thoughts of kissing and intimacy and sex have all come rushing back. 

Just the thought of kissing someone makes me want to cry because I want it so badly. But still not with someone that doesn't really like me back. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, to all those that are happy being single, or are happy with no sex life while they are dating and finding someone to do that stuff with, how do you get over the longing for sex?

&amp;#x200B;

How do I get over the craving, and longing for kissing, cuddling and sex, and all the other intimacy that goes with that? Are there any methods of getting over it? Are there any other ways, or advice, or anything you can tell me that can make me stop this longing?

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to be happy being single, because I can't force someone to love me if they just don't. But I just cannot get over this one part of single life.

Me: 47M, single professional no kids, living in a medium to large US city. 

   Ive went out with 2 ladies recently that have said something to me that throw me off, and I’m not sur if my internal reaction to it is appropriate.

 Situation 1: First date with a woman. Age appropriate, no kids. Met a local place I know, and had a Pretty ok time. I’m 100% a gentleman, and cross no lines and never even hinted at anything physical. At the end of the date, she brought up comtiniing the date and we discussed locations. She suggested we go back to one of our places (hers was first suggested but is a far way compared to mine). Her next line is “but I’m not going to F\_\_\_ you”… not said playfull. I was put off by this as I wasnt at all going in that direction. 

Situation 2: Our 2nd date. The first date was ok, ended with a light kiss. I never crossed any lines or hinted at anything inappropriate (again). Middle of the date we were talking a bout cooking and I mentioned that I really love to cook (I do) and she asked when am I going to cook for her. As we were planning an event for our next date, I asked if she wanted to come over Sunday afternoon and I’d make us a meal and he answer was “ Yes, but I’m not going to have sex with you. Just putting that out there”.  Not said playfully.

  I’m a little offended at these statements And I dont understand if this is just a sign of the times and a reaction to how other guys approach women. I very much like dislike having to walk on eggshells Around a topic that I’m not even exploring (yet). Both of these events happened within a month of each other, so Im thinking it might be me.

It’s been about 3.5 months. We both agreed on casual in the beginning but I caught feelings and told him. He told me he liked me but wanted to continue what we’ve been doing (which I agreed too because it was early and I do like him). When we first started seeing each other sex was a huge part of it. I would go to his place and we’d basically tear each other’s clothes off as soon as I got there and after that order in and watch some movies. I would also spend the night (but he never seemed to get much sleep). We typically only really see each other every 2 weeks (he has a lot going on professionally and it works with my kid schedule). We do text back and forth usually about once a day (although that has slowed down a bit). Lately things have changed a bit (not in a bad way necessarily). The first time I saw him after I said I had feelings things seemed pretty normal. He’s always gotten a little distant after we spend a decent amount of time together (in that he doesn’t initiate for a few days, always responds quickly though). I think he might have some commitment/attachment issues and I’m willing to be patient (I’m not looking to get married or move in with him or anything). Last weekend he suggested picking me up and taking me on a more traditional date. I wanted to go to his place so that we could be more physically affectionate (my sister was at my house and he’s allergic to cats so my house was a no go) but I told him I wouldn’t spend the night because he had something to do early the next day and I know he doesn’t sleep well. He apologized but seemed into it when I suggested that. We went out to eat (he paid like usual) and then went back to his place. The date that we had been on before was just lunch. He didn’t try to get physical at all. We cuddled, laughed and had a blast. Should I be worried that it’s been a month since we’ve had sex? I’ve never been with a guy who didn’t at least try to initiate (the guy I’m seeing now is a bit old fashioned and doesn’t really like me to sext or get too dirty via text). My thoughts are: Maybe he’s having some issues (he’s 48, I’m 43), he’s afraid that having sex will just lead to more feelings for me and he doesn’t want to deal with that (IMO cuddle is way worse for feelings so the fact that we cuddle for hours is worse) or maybe he’s trying to slow things down to see where he’s at emotionally.

I tend to look for an emotional connection before I think about having sex with someone.

When I'm looking to meet someone, I'd admit looks are important to a degree.  I just feel like I'd want to date someone and get to know them a bit and not have sex too soon, since I know my sexual attraction for them would be affected by how well we get along and like each other as a person.

Post divorce,  I began dating a man who made me promises of a future together.  He said we'd travel and share a life and a home. 2 years later, not one thing he said came to fruition. I had been played. The lies were bad enough, but the most egregious offense is that this man wasted my time. Time that is no longer on my side. I just turned 48. I met that man when I was not quite 45. I was fresh out of a 20+ year marriage and admittedly naive. I met this man and was swept off my feet. I should have known.  By the time I realized he was bad news, my heart was in  it. My mind told me to leave this one behind, but my heart held on, holding our hope for him to change and for all his beautiful promises of having a life together to be true. All it was, in the end, was a waste of time. If I want to put a positive spin on things, I can say that I learned a lot from that relationship. I sure did. But I could have done without the lessons, to be honest. I could have done without that kind of heartbreak and abuse, that I am still haunted by, despite leaving him behind. 

Ending a relationship can be hard. Even when you know it is the right thing. The best thing. The ONLY thing you can do, it is still hard. But just because something is hard, it doesn't mean you shouldn't muster up all the strength in your being and do it. 

I am so grateful I was finally able to do that because that ending was only the very beginning of good things. Since leaving behind a relationship that did nothing but waste my time, I now have made time to nurture the important relationships in my life with the people who deserve it. Because I ended one thing, I am now open to the start of something new. Because I put an end to wasting time, this amazing person has entered my life and I'm once again feeling life is full of possibilities.  

If anyone is feeling like they are wasting time, the best advice I can offer is to make the decision not to do that anymore. Make the decision to start using your time more wisely and only spend that currency on those who are truly worth it. You deserve far better than you've been getting and it is only once you get some distance, that you gain perspective.

I’ve tried dating different options but found that the only guys that drive me bonkers are really underweight small guys.

How do I meet a guy like that that’s between the ages of 40-60? I’ve tried dating sites but the options are super limited because “underweight” men are a really small percentage in general.

*Is there another CITY or COUNTRY (English speaking) that I should move to to have more options like this?!*

And maybe I'm just looking for a hand to get back up. Anyway here goes...

40m here, divorced almost 5 years ago. For most of the the since then, I just had no interest in anything romantic.  Like none at all, just couldn't bring myself to go through it again. Just lost all belief in love etc. Late last year I kind of had a moment where I realised that closing yourself off like that is not a very fun way to live, so I thought fuck it, if I ever want to be happy I need to get out there and try. Even if it meant risking getting hurt.

Went on a few dates, nothing really life changing. Then I met a girl a while ago via OLD. Really hit it off straight away, she was attractive, intelligent, but also down to earth and non judgemental. Basically everything I wanted. It didn't take long for things to get physical, and just between us the sex was incredible!  I didn't know it could be so good,  like I finally understood what people write and sing about. 

Needless to say I caught the feels. We'd been dating for two and a half months and last weekend hung out at my place. I thought it was time to see where we were at, I let her know that I really wanted her to be a bigger part of my life and we had a good conversation about how we both felt  and we both agreed we wanted more. I actually cried in front of her because I was happy for the first time in years.

Fast forward to today.. not so good. Id been trying to get hold of her for a couple of days with no response. I know she's busy with shift work and all, but after 3 days if no response I texted and asked if she could be better with communication, as it doesn't feel great to not hear back from someone for days.. and she texts back ""sorry, were just not suited, better if we don't catch up anymore, I'll see you around😊"". That's right, she broke up by text and ended with a smiley face emoji. 

Wow. A complete 180 from when we parted. I just can't believe that I finally let myself open up and be vulnerable to someone that I really liked, only to have my heart broken immediately. I think she has a problem with commitment, and I really am kicking myself for not seeing the signs and keeping myself in check, but the heart wants what it wants.

I accepted when I started dating again that I had to be prepared to get hurt, but it still sucks when it happens. I guess I'll  take a break from it all for a while, and one-day dust myself off and try again.

No judgment only curiosity to help me to understand the thought process and to help heal.

I met a guy thru OLD that presented himself as single. He was great to talk to and seemed very interested in me. I found him to be incredibly attractive so the relationship went sexual quickly. 

As time progressed I could tell by his actions that something was off. I originally blamed it on him being anxious or different then went to me being the issue. Looking back I see every sign of being a side chick. I liked him so I didn't want to believe what was clearly in front of me. My fault here and am learning to trust my instincts more.

I found out by him asking me if I would still have sex with him if he was in a relationship. I'm assuming he felt bad about leading me on and put the truth out there. This was after being intimate many times. I was then able to put all the pieces together and everything made sense. Honestly I fell bad for his girl because she deserves better. I'm sure I'm one of many that he has played this scenerio with and he is putting her at an unknown risk.

I know thier is no cookie cutter answer to this and every one is different including him. My question is why do people in general present themselves as single just to cheat? Ultimately you hurt the person that you are cheating with too. You have brought them into an unknown triangle and have no intention of a future with them. Is this because you see them as a throw away and simply don't care if they get hurt or is it because you are missing something so badly in your relationship that you feel it is ok to mislead others to get it? In this situation do you care about the other person at all?

But learning this about him just made me think about what to look for when I’m ready for a serious relationship. 

I make a good salary, have no debt, have my house more than 50% paid off, and have both individual retirement savings and am working towards a solid pension. I am also saving towards my kids college which will be paid off prior to them ever stepping foot on campus as freshman. I also have recently begun looking into long-term care insurance for when I’m older and I am purchasing an investment property in the next three years.

After a conversation we had last night, I would guess that he has less then $50K in retirement savings and no pension coming. He makes an OK salary and has a mortgage on his house. He’s changed jobs and moved a lot, so I don’t think he’s really built anything up. 

I have always had the position that I won’t date somebody with serious debt because of how hard I’ve worked to secure my financial future. While there’s no debt here, it’s highly concerning to me that it nearly 50 he’s not prepared for what’s coming. This wasn’t something I really thought about in my late 20s when I was last dating because lots of people were preparing for retirement – even though I already was. But now, those years are eminent.

Again, this is a casual relationship. But it made me really think about what to look for when it’s not.

Some background: I grew up Mormon, married young with zero experience in romance, divorced after 17 years due to no connection (see my first reddit post...). Post separation/divorce, I jumped head first into a long term relationship after a tiny amount of dating. I broke up with that GF a year ago and now here I am again, trying some dating. So far, I'm finding myself getting too emotional or mentally involved with a girl that I'm not compatible with. 

I think my problem is coming out of covid and getting over excited about the slightest amount of affection. After kissing, I get all attached. It makes me want to focus my energy on only her. I also feel bad telling women I'm still looking around. Maybe I feel safer in a monogamous relationship because that's all I've known. 

Ultimately, I want a long term relationship. I just don't want to make the same mistake again. I want someone that's easy for me to talk to and both attracted to each other. If I found this person, I think it would be time to try only focusing on her.

I finally connected with a great match on OLD. He's a kind, interesting man. I have a ton of things in common with him, and he shares my value system. We have a great, relaxed conversation going, and I look forward to receiving his messages. The problem is, we matched TWO months ago. Up until now, I have been fine with not meeting IRL. I'm busy with my kids. I had finals. He has a busy work schedule (2nd shift which is tough). I wasn't fully vaccinated when we first matched. The reasons we had not met seemed to be good ones. However, at the one month mark I was ready to pack things in. That very day, he suggested we get together for drinks ""sometime"". I gladly accepted, thinking that the ball was finally rolling. Annnnd a month later, we still have not met up, and he has not brought it up again. Now, here's the thing. I happen to have a mutual friend with my match who I am very close to. I finally reached out to my friend to see if he had anything to say about the situation (and to make sure my match was legit). My friend said that the match is who he says he is. He did mention a potential red flag however. Apparently my match has a co-worker that he is extremely close with, and my friend has gotten the feeling that my match may have unrequited feelings for the co-worker (she has a boyfriend). Since learning this information, my perspective on things has shifted quite a bit. I now wonder if my match is using OLD to distract him from his feelings for this other woman. Perhaps he has no intent to actually date anyone else. Regardless of what his reasons for not meeting up with me are, I'm no longer enjoying this text marathon with someone who is essentially a stranger. I'm looking for opinions as to how you guys would handle this situation. I have a lot of free time over the next couple of days due to the long weekend.

We have been on a date as well. The conversation started casually about dating, etc. during the conversation, I stated that personally, I believe that relationships should happen organically and not be forced. I also said that healthy relationships typically start with friendship as their foundation and eventually grow into something more. And that I wasn’t necessarily choosing to be single but instead choosing to allow things to happen organically, rooted in friendship. 

Apparently, my expectations are too high by thinking this way because the response I received was that if I feel this way, I am then neglecting myself the opportunity of being in a relationship and that I was choosing to remain alone. After all, it may not happen in that order. 

I was taken aback by this person's response. It's important to note that this “person” is also very confidently said that “if I wanted to, with time and effort, I could win you over.” - as if I am a trophy, and it's all a challenging game to be played.
