I [F25] am in a little bit of a predicament. I‚Äòll start with John[M39]. I met John 2 months ago through OLD. Things were going great, I trusted him, the sex was awesome and he seemed genuinely interested and happy to be with me. He is an older guy who runs his own business but would always go out of his way to text every morning, or even check in throughout the day. 

Last week I told John that I was going to be on staycation for the next couple of weeks and that I wanted to see him‚Ä¶.Absolute crickets. I haven‚Äôt heard from this man in an entire week. Do I leave it? 

Now onto Harold [M35]. Him and I had been talking for much less time. Possibly two weeks but have known each other for months. We work within the same company but not together. He expressed a lot of interest in me and just like John, would go out of his way to check up on me. 

I asked him some questions about his day about 2 days ago and‚Ä¶More crickets. No response, no follow up, just‚Ä¶.Silence.

I haven‚Äôt reached out to either of them because at the end of the day, if you can go 2 or more days without talking to me then you aren‚Äôt interested in me. I‚Äôm so confused as to why this keeps happening and how I can deal with the rejection? I‚Äôm really unsure of what I‚Äôm doing.

Also to put things into context. I‚Äôm not clingy, overbearing or text all day. I have a busy job and text back when I can but always put in effort. I expressed interest in both men and they expressed interest back, openly and in person. This was very out of the blue.

I dated a girl for about 5 months in early 2020. She was beautiful and mysterious and quirky and weird and she was head over heels for me. The conversation was stimulating, we shared the same quirky sense of humour and the sex was incredible. She also happened to have an extensive mental health history and an incurable personality disorder and over time this became apparent with gaslighting and lying and I had to distance myself from her until we broke up, twice. We have never spoken since.

I know that there was no possibility of living a happy normal life with her but the passion and chemistry is not something I have experienced before... or since. And this truly haunts me.

I have been with many women since then, trying to find a connection, but I can't. I have managed to pinpoint the feeling that something is lacking to a few features: shared quickly/weird humour and conversation. I can be conventionally funny but I have a pretty surreal sense of humour and I like making up words and singing bizarre little songs and she is pretty much the only person outside of my brother and male friends who really clicked with that. Conversation wise she just seemed to have interesting takes on topical issues that I rarely find, she could play devil's advocate and be a little controversial but in an intelligent way. I mostly find that on dates I am entertaining someone with my conversation rather than having a true back and forth, or just discussing topics in a fairly dry way.

She was all this whilst being head turningly hot too.

At the time I felt like it was no problem, I'd find someone with those qualities who didn't happen to have a severe personality disorder that revealed itself later, but every single time I meet someone and give it a chance I honestly just feel nothing. It's been almost 3x more time since I left her than we were actually together and still I feel like I am getting nowhere.

So I‚Äôve been talking on and off to a girl for the past couple of weeks. I matched with her on hinge and we were into similar stuff, our taste in movies and entertainment was pretty much the same, lotr, Star Wars, marvel etc that kind of stuff. We talked on hinge for a bit and then I decided to ask if she had Snapchat so we could talk somewhere else and I gave her mine and said if she wanted to talk that‚Äôs cool but if she didn‚Äôt that was fine, didn‚Äôt want to pressure her and also went in with the notion of I might as well try. 

She added me soon after and ever been talking on that from then on. We spoke on Saturday and she sent me a message about a wedding she was at, I asked her how it was and we talked about it for a bit. She then asked what I did with my day off and I told her I went out with a friend for some drinks in the city and a meal and talked about what else we got up to. She then suggested that we could meet up and get some drinks sometime and I said that I‚Äôd be up for that depending on our schedules as her shifts rotate. 

I‚Äôm certainly up for it even if I just tell myself it‚Äôs just a hangout not a date as it‚Äôll be the first time I see her in person. It just felt weird being asked to meet up by someone again, I‚Äôve been single for a year so that‚Äôs probably why. I mentioned it to the friend I had drinks with and he thinks I should go for it and I‚Äôve got nothing to lose and she must be interested as she brought it up first.

During this time I shared a flat with this Morrocan guy (21) who I developed a situationship with.  We lived together for 6 months and it was amazing. We agreed on keeping things casual. I was seeing other people, vice versa.

But then things began to change. What was before a casual fwb arrangement, now seemed a lot more intimate.  He started acting a lot more affectionate, holding my hand in public, giving me forehead kisses.. He introduced me to all his friends and family, and spoke of visiting me in England to meet my family. On valentines day he even bought me a crystal necklace. I stopped seeing other people as I saw potential in this, and he wasn't seeing anyone else either.

Near the end of my time in Spain I was dying to tell him how I felt. But the fear of scaring him off, or a LDR not working held me back and I decided not to. It was obvious how we felt about each other, without having to say ‚Äú I love you‚Äù just yet I na√Øvely thought. 

After Spain, my 6month study abroad in Japan began. We messaged each other everyday for 5 months and I planned to visit him in September. Thats when I decided I‚Äôll tell him how I feel. I thought if we can survive 6 months apart and still prioritize each other, then an LDR could actually work.  

Until I noticed this girl who he began chatting with near the end of my time in Spain, began appearing pretty frequently on his story. After the third time she was uploaded on his story, I decided to call him out on it. To find out if he had moved on, and what we actually were. 

I got my answer. He still didn‚Äôt want a relationship and told me he was sorry if I developed  feelings. Turns out he treated his previous ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù with the same affection and they all got the wrong idea too. I was crushed. I felt like I was just another one of those girls he used for sex and affection. we spent 6 months living together, n got so close that I thought I meant more to him than that. All this emotional investment felt like such a waste of time.
  So I decided to cut things off with him. He told me he‚Äôd give me the time I need, but he ‚Äúcant lose me as a friend n as a person who means a lot to him.‚Äú  I chose not to respond and to try n just move on.

19,paaqn5,1629758809,Messed up and overthinking,"Hey guys. Long read but need your help.

So I think I messed up with this guy. Long story made as short as possible. My friend and one of her roommates matched us together and its like a blind date kind of thing. We hit it off despite very different views and backgrounds and have been talking or communicating daily for about 5 weeks. He's long distance and works 7 days and we are both finishing off degrees. We made plans to see other this past weekend since we had a small break from everyday life. He has family near me and stays with them when he comes down. They are really close knit. Despite being uber nervous about meeting in person for the 1st time we had an amazing date on Saturday night. It was a breath of fresh air. We had made plans initially to hang out on Sunday for brunch and after the great date we were still on to do that but it would't be a long date because he had to get on the road to get back home for school and work.

Fast forward to Sunday. I called him to see about meeting up after leaving another event and he answered but had to get off the phone rather quickly to help a family member. When I got home and got ready I texted and asked him if we were still on for today and told him I would head to his side of town since it's about an hour drive. He called me right back and asked to take a raincheck. I was kind of taken aback and at a loss for words. His reasoning was that he didn't really get a lot of time to spend with his family and said he would be back in about 2 weeks for another family gathering. I got kind of quiet and he asked again if that was ok. I mustered up the statement and told him I would be pretty disappointed if I didn't get a chance to see him before he left because we don't get a lot of time together. I'm assertive, he's passive and non-confrontational. He stated that he would work something out and I said I'm even willing to meet you on your way out just to see you and we don't have to brunch or anything. I could sense the tension and after a couple of alternative options I just gave in and told him I fine with whatever he decided to do. It was a little awkward to say the least. I found out later that he had this entire conversation in front of the family member that hooked us up and then of course she told my friend. They thought I was a little dramatic. I like people to keep their word and I explained that to my friend who is as flaky as the wind so she didn't get the big deal.

He and I did talk as he drove home but we didn't get to see each other. He apologized and I also apologized for the way that I handled the situation. He asked the question where do we go from here and I explained that I really liked him and would like to see where this goes. I'm intentional, he is a if it's meant to be kind of guy.

It didn't happen in my own friend circle but it did happen outside of it. This also happened with some frequency in the celebrity world, with some beautiful female celebrities dating ""ugly"" male actors.

However, I notice that this phenomenon seems to have dissappeared for quite some time. Even years before the covid 19 lockdowns, I had noticed that the number of ugly guys dating pretty girls or even just any girls in general have dropped drastically, to the point where i wouldn't be able to find even one when walking down the street.

Regardless of the intimacy, I either didn't text next day or let the conversation die out and now I hate myself for doing that. It's not that I was looking for sex and then ghost them or something, but in reality it may sometimes have looked like it. Although I never let a text go unanswered, my mind was almost always set on getting rid of them. 

Now that I'm somewhat older and more mature, I recognize the harm it could have caused and the mistrust in people it definitely caused, as well as the damaged self esteem of some of these sweet girls.

There really is no specific reason for me to come with this now, but it has been bothering me for a while and I honestly hate myself for having treated girls like this.

1) They won‚Äôt be around to meet up with you. They are far from you.
2) They flirt and fall in love with you very quickly.
3) If you suspect you are being catfished, don‚Äôt give out too much personal information
4) They will suggest a chat room like Google hang outs 
5) If in doubt do a Google reverse image search on photos they send you or on their profile.
6) If their image appears on a website with another identity, chances are the person you are chatting with is not the person you think they are. You‚Äôve been catfished!

Everything went well, we spoke normally, no flirting or anything - just two people meeting for the first time - and my friend told me the next day that she liked me and that I should dm her, so I did. She first took like a day to answer back and I didn't make such a big of a deal, but the next day she did the same thing. There's been a couple of times that she answered in like 2 hours and now I've been waiting for like 2 days an a half for her to answer.

The conversation is just me asking questions about her life, her family and her exams, like she doesn't really ask about me or my friend. She's apologized for taking so long like two times.

I do like her and I was initially interested in inviting her out to know each other better but I'm not sure if she's busy or if she just isn't really interested.

34,pabw5c,1629762805,Should I stay or should I go now?,"So me and my current girlfriend have been dating about 5 years and I once proposed.  After a work injury, surgery, getting lazy, and gaining a lot of weight (both of us). I decided to get in shape.  I told her my routine and how I was going to change things up to work on myself. Here are some of the facts from my relationship. 

1) I am a Doctorate of business student with about 1 semester left. I finished my bachelor's and masters in less than a year with a self paced program. 

2) I've lost about 40 lbs of the weight I gained and I want to lose about 30 more.  I have gained a lot of muscle and even doubled some of my max's from last year.  (Curling 50 to curling 100lbs)

3) I feel that my girlfriend has no drive to do anything and I am quickly becoming unattractive to her.  I sat down and told her so, and she accepted it because she kept doing nothing and has been doing nothing.

4) Her daughters father makes 75k a year and doesn't pay a dime in child support, but she refuses to ask him for any help so I get stuck with the bill. Also he keeps her for maybe 30-40 of 365 days a year.  

5) She is constantly on her phone looking at houses and stuff to buy.  Things she does buy is not used but for about 2 weeks and then trashed. 


Our arguments consist of: (""  "" is her words verbatim)

 ""well I work out when I'm cleaning the house"" (of course I never do enough around the house according to her) (cleaning is not working out.... thats called moving)

""I don't like when you go workout because you leave me here by myself""

""You get to spend your money on stuff you want but I don't get to buy anything""(I bought a 3D printer and I am making money using it)

""Of course you're never wrong, you're a doctor!"" (I admit I'm wrong all the time.)

""Why don't we have sex anymore? I bet you don't find me attractive""

In short....  im tired of busting my butt to provide for her and her daughter while her dad does nothing.  I'm tired of all the useless arguments.  If I was to pick up and leave tomorrow I could afford my own place, but she may be stuck for a bit. But, her house (where we live) is about 45k more than what we put into it.  
I tried to leave in January, had an apartment booked, and the day before she went through my email and found out about it.  I felt so guilty and pressured into staying that I canceled everything.  

Suggestions?  I may be about to become a Doctor, but it sure af didn't prepare me for this crap.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pabw5c/should_i_stay_or_should_i_go_now/

Suddenly I have 4 dates this week, and 3 of them (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday) are at the same location at the same time of day.  For some reason I just started imagining a scenario where one of the workers notices and makes a joke about it, and now I'm afraid it was a mistake to even take that risk (even though I know it's extremely unlikely).

These are all just first dates so there's obviously nothing wrong with playing the field, but I'd prefer it if these girls don't have it thrown in their faces (especially the girl I'm meeting on Friday, who I like the most).  Am I insane for even worrying about this or should I try to change locations now?  All three girls have expressed excitement about this place because they've never been before and think it sounds cool, so it would kinda suck to have to change plans on them.

l(24f) met this guy (27m)on tinder and we rarely talk at first cause I didn't want to have sex w him at all and all I want is just fwb. long story short, one night I got a mental breakdown so I ask him if I can go to his place crying and hugging. he says yes, and that is our first time meeting in person(plus we only match for 2 weeks). we kinda like it so he asked me to stay over at his place 4 nights in the same week eventually. (I know it's crazy)

I still go to his place to sleep/have sex w him now and we get alone well. But he is just very sweet and nice to me: he cooks me delicate dinner, we watch movie tgt, and he even made me my fav bagel from scratch one morning. we hang out at the park once, have coffee a few times and he also hold my hands and kiss me in public.

I found those behavior confusing so I told him I enjoy this fwb and ask him what he want: he said he doesn't know what he wants at this point but he is really attracted to me and enjoys every moment w me.

he starts to ask if he can see my place, mmet my friends, wanna take me to the beach, to the museum, and have dinner date w me.

since I only do fwb kind of things here so I kinda just lost the ability to see if it is a serious thing or not...

we get along v well, have the same taste in music/movies, share lots of interests, however, we both just got out of a relationship.

throwaway account bc i‚Äôm not sure if he uses reddit (even tho if he sees this its blatantly obvious its about him) 

i (19f) started a job about a month ago at a fast food place to get some money over summer before i go back to uni and i‚Äôll probs be back at christmas, easter etc. i really feel like i‚Äôve clicked with my shift manager (22m) and might be catching feelings for him and i can‚Äôt tell if he is too so basically ::: 

we have a lot of banter which is sometimes quite flirty, he regularly mentions how he hasnt been laid in 5 years and he regularly makes comments about my body, i‚Äôve also noticed him looking me up and down pretty obviously a few times- one time he was sitting a few feet behind me and made a comment on how my apron wraps around / crosses over at the back where my ass is (ie he was looking at my ass) and this means i‚Äôm super skinny (not sure if he realises this is a massive compliment to me bc i have struggled with my body image my entire life). a couple days ago he pulled me to the side and said next time we close the store together i have to sweep/mop on my knees bc i did a bad job lol. he also drops compliments on my weight into conversation a lot. we have a lot of physical contact for example a lot of the time we will poke eachother when we pass eachother, he will feel my biceps and abs sometimes, and when i burned my neck on the grill he ran his fingers over it and i swear i got butterflies for the first time in years. he also talks to me about my love life and has suggested that someone else ‚Äòisn‚Äôt the right person for me‚Äô and he had a bit of a hopeful look on his face when he said this. he hugs me sometimes when nobody‚Äôs around (his hugs are so nice) . we also brush up against eachother quite a lot and sometimes we‚Äôll stand next to eachother while working so our sides are touching all the way down. we message outside of work too, the other night he said if he could drive he would take me to a viewpoint so we could look at the moon,  and in another conversation said ‚Äòyou can have more compliments if you want‚Äô. 

i catch myself thinking about him a LOT and i really think i‚Äôm catching feelings but i‚Äôm in a weird situation at the moment and i‚Äôm going back to uni in 2 weeks so i won‚Äôt see him for 3 months. i also don‚Äôt want to let him know how i feel incase i‚Äôve read the situation completely wrong and i dont want to fuck anything up. reddit, does he like me?!!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pads21/is_my_19f_shift_manager_22m_into_me_or_am_i/

For example, I had this really cute girl in line next to me today, at first I was thinking like talk to her dude, then I was like not everybody is going to be your gf you moron, and I finally acted like I was going to get a pencil, so I had to say excuse me, then I made a comment and we started talking and she was pretty engaging.

Will I ever be good enough? This may sound like another low-self esteemed guy complaining. But I want to be clear about a few things.

I think if you‚Äôve had low success rate at anything, you would think you are not good at it. To think otherwise would be delusional. But that is not to say it is permanent and that you cannot improve! Because you can!

But to explain my mind state, we would have to look at it from a longer period of time, where I have been changing, so there‚Äôs different results at different times. But I say that to make the point that it seems like I‚Äôve tried everything and still having little success. 

Assessing myself as honest I can‚Äîtrying to limit my personal bias‚ÄîI think I am a great catch! But at this point I feel like none of my positive qualities matter cuz I‚Äôm rejected before they get a chance to even know me‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve never felt I was a good looking guy. Particularly my face. I‚Äôve always been in good shape, athletic. Totally ripped at one point. But I try not to show it off like some douchebag. 

I have a ton of grit and perseverance. Overcome a lot of personal circumstances to get here. I am intelligent, got a well paying career. I‚Äôm focused on self improvement and spirituality and inner peace. I prioritize being honest and not mislead people, even if it means I don‚Äôt get what I want. I think they call that integrity or something. 

I think some other words that would describe me are: disciplined, mindful, focused, determined.

I‚Äôd like to think my communication skills are good but I am also skeptical of this, since communication is a two way street. The ways I communicate, I believe is efficient however if others are not on the same page, it doesn‚Äôt matter. So in a sense, I feel like my communication skills are being ‚Äúnegated‚Äù by others‚Äô less efficient communication. I am aware of this and trying to figure out if I‚Äôm just full of myself or others just suck at communication.

This can be used as an example of a larger theme I suspect. I believe I am conducting myself in efficient manners, but the rest of the world doesn‚Äôt. So communication is even worse cuz we are not on the same page in terms of HOW to communicate. It may very well be better if I ‚Äúdumbed down‚Äù myself just to be on the same page as the rest. 

Listing as most efficient way to communicate:
1. Both communicate in my method
2. Both communicate in their method
3. Both communicate in differing methods

I love basketball. I can say with certainty that I‚Äôve spent over 10k hours playing, practicing, and studying basketball. I am my most confident self when on the courts.

I appreciate art. I like poetry. I used to and still dabble in art and poetry. I like hiphop/r&amp;b music. I like puzzles/board games/brain teasers. I like to think of my own witty jokes. I am a curious forever student. I have a great attention to detail, great memory, I can recall 100 of digits of pi or lyrics from some of the most hardcore gangsta rappers. 

I can come off as blunt/insensitive/asshole because of my honest/unfiltered mouth. I will make inappropriate jokes. (I‚Äôm also not fully convinced that this is a flaw but mismatch in personalities; my closer friends seem to understand me).

I am an introvert and don‚Äôt like big groups. I don‚Äôt drink alcohol (aka the de facto adult activity) so I don‚Äôt go to bars much. I‚Äôm not a dancer so I‚Äôve never been to any clubs either. 

I can be pretty black and white about things. 

I‚Äôve never been in a relationship. partly because of my whole family/at home situations that I don‚Äôt think it wise to bring someone else into. Maybe I don‚Äôt deserve to be loved..? But of course the self esteem thing too. 

I have an above average sized member and the women I‚Äôve been with seemed to be impressed. And they seem thoroughly satisfied with my ability to use it. 

I‚Äôm a deep thinker and can see both sides of issues impartially. I think this can be interpreted as passive and indecisive. Or that I am against the person I‚Äôm talking to. A lot of times we don‚Äôt have the luxury of time to explain our whole thought process to one another. Most people usually favor one side passionately. I also wonder about the difference between being opinionated and judgmental.

I love who I am. But I also lament that I am not like the good looking, loud, lively, outgoing extroverted people (aka ‚Äúthe popular kids‚Äù)

I am tired. I‚Äôve worked so hard to get where I am now‚Äîschool, career, financially, and last and most importantly myself. But damn wtf it feels like I worked so hard and I‚Äôm still not good enough. 

Because of all the shit I‚Äôve been through, I learned to be optimistic and find silver linings. I had to. I know this negative thoughts are not indicative of that guy but It‚Äôs what I‚Äôm feeling now. 

I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm ugly or average? I‚Äôve been called handsome, cute. But I feel like those are weak words. I‚Äôve been complimented on my style. I‚Äôve never been called sexy, fiione, hot, kyooote. I think I‚Äôm a pretty good catch otherwise. And still improving. But I don‚Äôt want a woman to be like he‚Äôs got everything I want except that he‚Äôs ugly in the face.

And she was actually more attractive (physically and character-wise) than her bio had me believe. 

The next day, we texted for a bit, but her responses were super short, some only 1 word.  I was thinking perhaps I miss read the great date.  However, I thought I'd take my shot, because I felt like I was about to get ghosted as I have in the past--so I asked her out for a 2nd date.  8 hours later I here back ""Sure!"".  Another 1 word.  The next few days I tried to limit my texting to not be overbearing.  Sent her something funny I saw and got a ""haha"" 8 hours later.  So I'm thinking, she is super busy or doesn't really like me.

So the 2nd date we planned was coming up. I asked if were still on yesterday, never heard back so thought for sure I was getting ghosted this time.  Well, just heard back, ""totally!"". 

Perhaps some people are actually just not texters, at all?  I have had people with poor texting skills, but never experiences this.

So I just would like to know what‚Äôs normal. I haven‚Äôt seen a normal healthy relationship. I‚Äôve only read about them and what they should look like. But it‚Äôs one thing to read a psychologists book and another to hear from people who‚Äôve actually lived it. ü§ç",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pagzr0/dating_tips_please_and_thanks/
92,pahamx,1629784028,picking a girl or guy up on the first date,"So I met this nice girl on a dating site and we where chatting for a couple days and had a real nice phone call that lasted over an hour. When I asked her on a date at the end of the phone call I asked her where she wanted to meet. We plan on getting food and walk in the park. and she said she had no car and asked if I could pick her up at here house. She also said that she is saving for a car if the adds to the story.

My question is if you date had no car and asked if you could pick him or her up to go on the date  would you guys do it?  Do you think it is risky or to soon to drive her or him to and from the date.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pahamx/picking_a_girl_or_guy_up_on_the_first_date/
93,pahcoi,1629784295,dating a super tall woman,"I am 183cm...she is 180 before heels. 

a yes and no decision. I once dated a 178cm woman and when were kissing, she leaned over me and that killed the mood for me. it was emasculating. Im mostly the one holding the woman when we hug and they love the difference

I do enjoy when a woman wears heels though. she will be much taller and even though she will be very tall, I am ok as 6'. im certain it will come up inside me every so often till I get used to it. 

all the women ive been with (not many, they were long relationships) were 162cc and 165cm and 163cm

I do get a lot of messages from taller women though.

not sure what to do and if im putting thought into it then it seems I shouldnt?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pahcoi/dating_a_super_tall_woman/
94,pahhqn,1629784955,I need advice and need to vent,"So I met this dude recently and he originally told me he was single. The he tried to say it was a joke and how he has a gf but come to find out he actually doesn‚Äôt and is in a casual/fwbs situation. The fact he tipped toed around it is a red flag and pissed me off tbh. Another thing that bothers me is he said they are both fragile and she‚Äôs keeping casual to feel secure which is the most idiotic thing I heard. He thinks there is more to the connection than there is. He thinks it‚Äôs love when it‚Äôs actually trauma bonding! Mind you he was drunk when he said he had a girlfriend and about the being single. It was extremely insensitive to make a joke about being single and he also said sometimes he prefers it that way. So for me they are both emotionally unavailable because he said he wants a relationship but he kept flip flopping so he obviously doesn‚Äôt know what he wants. He said it‚Äôs casual due to ‚Äúcircumstance‚Äù which is bullshit. He wants something more when there is nothing. I been in the same situation where i thought there was more to my fwb/casual situation but there wasn‚Äôt! No strong relationships have ever been formed by using sex as a tool or form of healing. He also says the sex drains him but sex is supposed to be healing not draining! There‚Äôs a difference between making love and just fucking. He claims to be an old soul too yet he‚Äôs a skeptic! Expecting to heal yourself through sex is just stupid! You have to heal yourself on your own and if you‚Äôre wondering why I‚Äôm so pressed it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm drawn to his energy and he feels familiar like I knew him in another life or something or he feels like an old friend and I been there done that. I had a bad gut feeling about the whole thing and I dead ass told him it wasn‚Äôt going to work out and how he deserves more than to just settle for less than he deserves. She‚Äôs giving him just enough to keep him hooked and it‚Äôs total bullshit. This is called bread crumbing and is a form of emotional manipulation and love bombing. I have dealt with so many covert narcissistic sociopaths it‚Äôs not even funny. He said he‚Äôs playing it by ear and wants to enjoy it while it lasts but it just sounds like they are using each other for sex tbh. He‚Äôs 28 and she‚Äôs younger than him. I‚Äôm 32 and it‚Äôs frustrating and agonizing when people get caught up in karmic connections aka quantum entanglements. It frustrates me because sex is easy to get but a real connection is rare. She obviously doesn‚Äôt want a real relationship. I told him getting his hopes up hoping for a relationship from a casual mostly sexual relationship is pointless. Sex isn‚Äôt love and it‚Äôs only been going on for a few months. He also said I‚Äôm a sweet kind and nice girl and I should continue to be bluntly honest. Anywho, what do y‚Äôall think? The whole entire situation sounds like a hot mess if you ask me. You think he would know better since he said he was in toxic relationships before do you think he would be able to recognize the patterns but he did say he hasn‚Äôt been in more brutal ones so yea. The more brutal ones involve the person stringing you along using sex making it seem like you‚Äôre important when you really aren‚Äôt. Personally I believe if you don‚Äôt wanna relationship with someone you shouldn‚Äôt string them along or want them around just because of the sex being good it‚Äôs not fair to them and it‚Äôs not fair to yourself.It really pisses me off because I‚Äôve seen so many good people get fucked up by being in shitty situations or in shitty relationships. I care a lot about the world and truly wish people valued and respected themselves more. This is obviously self-destructive behavior and a form of self sabotage. Anyways thanks for listening and I swear I feel like a psychologist sometimes with as much as I know about this kind of stuff I myself have been there done that and played the fool before.it just sucks when you know it‚Äôs not going to end well and you feel powerless to do anything. I‚Äôd also like to add that I am extremely intuitive and also extremely empathic.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pahhqn/i_need_advice_and_need_to_vent/
95,pahqmv,1629786146,How do I date without overthinking it? (F20),"I recently got out of a relationship about a month and a half ago and felt like I was ready to step back into dating. I downloaded Hinge, matched with a few guys, and ended up talking to a few. I have been texting one guy more often recently (M22), and honestly, I am interested in getting to know him more. From what I've seen so far, he takes initiative, is kind, smart, and has similar interests as I do.

The problem is, I haven't dated in awhile and I feel like I overthink what I say or come across as when I am talking to a guy I'm interested in, and because of that, I tend to try and play it cool. For example, not sending too long of messages (because I don't want to be putting in more effort to the conversation), not showing curiousity (i don't want to be the only one asking the questions), or just being dry in conversation.  We haven't met in person yet so these thoughts are only about our text convos, but we are planning on meeting up soon. I feel like the way I act towards someone I'm interested ends up in self sabotage because I'm afraid of having to put in all the effort, even when that's not the case, and I end up seeming like I'm uninterested when I really am.

Does anyone have any advice on how to stop overthinking these situations? Or dating in general? I don't even mean to overthink these situations, I know whatever is meant to be will be, but I feel like I just wanna make a good impression and show the person that I am interested without seeming too needy :/",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pahqmv/how_do_i_date_without_overthinking_it_f20/
96,pahr4d,1629786215,How do I force myself to stop seeing my fwb?,"This gorgeous girl I matched on bumble with on July 4th and I have had been having causal sex. When we matched she just got out of a relationship and basically booty called me which I happily obliged.


Guys the sex is amazing. We both agree it's the best sex we've both ever had we can't explain it.. The compatibility is off the charts sex wise.

So there are some things I don't like about her so I'm happy to just have casual sex. But recently she's been hinting that casual sex isn't for her and she deservss more she knows her worth. Which ofc I agree with but that soemthing more isn't gonna be with me. 


I kept on inviting her over at night when I was horny and if she said yes then cool if not then I wouldn't push it. She eventually said she was done with this and told her I understood. I lasted a week and sent her some sexy things and she agreed there was some miscommunication and she missed my dick. Again idc bc this is only. About sex for me.


Well one one she asked if she could come over and I said yes. And she divulged she just left from a date. Idk why she told me. She can date whomever she wants but wanted to see me. Now shes getting more and more obvs the fuck buddy thing isn't enough for her she slept until like 3 am which Is fine. And she kept on apologizing for sleeping. I told her to calm down and go to sleep if you're tired. It's really nbd. I'm single so I don't mind having a hot ass girl sleep in my bed. I didn't say that last part a loud. 

And then a couple of weeks went by, I invited her over and she didn't reply. And then eventually did saying she was sorry for not replying and was going on spiritual journey and I can tell her mental health is deteriorating.

I try my hardest not to send her a text a week later but I'm weak. She obliges and she told me she started seeing someone else and went to a cabin with him for the second date. (again re affirming I want Nothing more than physically with her). They eventually break it off bc the guy is apparently a sugar daddy type dude who is seeing multiple girls. And she told me the sex was bad.


That was last night, now she stright up said she's thinks I'm hers. This hooking up is not healthy for her. And I hate myself bc I am aware what's occurring but I'm. Also a very horny person. The thing this girl is telling me and other aspects of her life I never want soemthing serous. But she's so hot and are sex is legit off th charts but I know I'm just gonna hurt her. Thoughts?

98,pahvv0,1629786878,Why is it so difficult having true feelings for someone again.,"He has all the right qualities and treats me how I know I deserve to be treated. 

How I‚Äôve always wanted to be treated. 

Yet I can‚Äôt bring myself to feel anything other than friendship towards him. 

It‚Äôs always been very difficult for me to fall in love. And even after dating it‚Äôs taken me time (months/weeks) to see that person, like I think I should have at the start or felt right at the beginning. 

I don‚Äôt really know how to change it. It feels impossible to move on or date again. When I can‚Äôt find myself interested in anyone. 

Me and my ex broke up a couple months ago. He was leading me on until he finally realized that he preferred to be with someone else. He put me through the most pain at one moment, then I‚Äôve ever had in my dating experiences. Was very very cold. But I can‚Äôt really say he was the worst or hate him. I can‚Äôt feel any anger whatsoever towards him. If anything I feel upset with myself. 

I‚Äôm not in a hurry or interested in moving on. I want to make sure to heal properly before moving on.
But I met this really sweet guy who seems perfect. And actually sees a future with me. Treats me like an actual princess. And most of all does like me. 

I am confused on why I can‚Äôt feel anything for him other than friendship when he‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever thought I wanted. 
Or difficult to feel anything for anyone truly without so much time passing by. It‚Äôs been an issues sense before my prior relationship. Took me months to really be interested 100% in my ex. And now it‚Äôs very difficult not being interested in him, when he‚Äôs given me many reason not to be. 

Any advise on how to change this?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pahvv0/why_is_it_so_difficult_having_true_feelings_for/
