So I went out with a girl recently. We had been talking for a few months and finally went out on the first date. She was great at first, and we talked for hours but let's just say the conversation didn't end too well. At some point, she only kept talking about herself and barely asked me questions about my own life. We did talk a lot about our philosophies, and other points of interest but I couldn't tell if she was confident or just egotistic. The conservation got awkward when it came to dating and our different takes on it. She just had a lot of dislikes as a person including most animals and didn't find physical affection too attractive. She also described herself as independent and not liking certain other things. It was more of incompatible ideas at this point but she tripped a red flag of mine when she said she slept with her ex's friend after a breakup and didn't regret it. But she stopped talking to her other friend because she slept with her ex-boyfriend. i found this funny and pointed out the hypocrisy ever so slightly but I think despite her denial she didn't like that I was judging her. But i opened up about some stuff I did and she judged me too. Anyway, the date ended awkwardly and I'm just chalking it up to an issue of incompatibility as we had too many different views on things.

Before this event i’m about to describe, i haven’t had a romantic interaction with anyone in roughly a year 

Anyway, About a month ago a new intern popped up and we started working a lot together. We naturally got along and had plenty in common and had lots of chemistry . Afterwork a lot
of us would go hang out at a bar.

One night, I go out to a bar where everyone is at. towards the end of the night, i’m very intoxicated. I ended up talking with the girl and we were pretty direct about our intentions so that night we went home together

we get back and r getting hot and heavy on each other. It came my turn, she went down on me, and i realized after about 20 seconds, i cant feel a thing. I’m way to intoxicated to the point of feeling numb and i cannot get it up. I told her that, apologized and  Reassured it had nothing to do with her. She said she understood and got her stuff and left. 

So this has never happened to me before. I’m pretty embarrassed about the whole thing and i’ve been avoiding her aswell. I had to have 1 work related conversation and it was the worst most awkward i’ve felt in a while. So now i cant even look at her without getting a anxiety so strong it hits my stomach and makes my face so red it burns. I’ve let this built up for a few weeks and we haven’t spoken to each other since

To be realistic with myself. Nothing would of ever came out of this. I move very soon anyways. I’m just stuck with this internal awkwardness and this anxiety.

We actually go to the same school although I graduated a bit early and he’s still on campus finishing up his final semester. We have some mutual friends. He wants to go out with me after this semester and said we should get coffee and maybe hang out at a park or something. He told me I was cute and all that. I gave him my Snapchat and we started talking on there. We had a decent conversation the first night or 2, but after about 5 days it’s weird. 

He sends so many textless snaps of his face, basically the same picture over and over. I send him one back and he will immediately send me another one in response. This could go on for hours and hours. He sends around 1,000 snaps a day. I don’t know if he just doesn’t have hobbies or what. He has a high score of nearly 2 million and I can see why. But I just don’t see the point in sending useless snaps over and over again. I’m not as familiar with Snapchat culture but it seems odd. His conversational skills are pretty dry but he was more engaging at first, so maybe he’s a player and he’s just trying to keep on my mind? Or this is some kind of ego thing for him? 

I left him on read because I thought maybe he didn’t want to talk to me anymore and it was his way of ending the conversation, but he sent me another one today and keeps doing it after I reply. He’s a popular guy around campus it seems. He plays sports and all but he’s off season right now and maybe he just doesn’t have much to do, but I’d figure he at least has to do homework. I don’t feel like I’ll fully know what he’s about until we do go on a date, it’s possible he’s just looking for sex. He asked me what I was comfortable with like the second day we talked. He asked if I’d be open to doing it if the mood was right. He said he wanted to ask just to make sure he didn’t make me uncomfortable, he asked what I didn’t want. So I just told him not to be overly sexual yet and that I like to get time to know a person before getting too intimate and he seemed fine with it. He said he was fine with whatever I want. I can ask him questions and initiate the talking more but I don’t want to be the only one doing it. I’m very emotionally open though and I know many guys aren’t at first.

But I just need to get this out there and see what folks think:

For reference, I'm 30M living in a big US city, so my dating pool is roughly 24-30 y/o women. Something like a third or a half of women's profiles mention dogs in one way or another. They'll either mention that they are a ""dog mom"" or have a requirement of ""must love dogs"" or say ""my dog must like you"" or ""I love petting any dog I see"" etc. It's frustrating because I don't want a dog and I don't want to date a woman who makes her dog the focus of her life, and this immediately cuts out a huge chunk of the dating pool. It's not something I really thought about until I started OLD.

Everyone is entitled to like what they like, I just find it peculiar that it's so culturally pervasive and I think it's unique to women (please correct me if I'm wrong). I think men generally like dogs, but dogs seem to have a very special and unique place in the hearts of many women. I know they are living animals, but I can't help but view it as a child-like extension of loving a stuffed animal or something. It just feels really immature to be so enthralled by dogs, and it's so common, and thus so disappointing to me.

Technically I couldn't get mad if he was still on tinder or went on a date with someone else.

We were texting and a joke came up; basically we were talking about hot dogs and it was (in context) very obviously a euphemism for sucking dick. So at one point I said, ""I guess I better eat the hot dogs."" His response was, ""there's only one hot dog of that type you should be eating.""

I am in the process of a divorce and was seeing a guy (34) who was also in the process of a divorce. Both are close to being finalized. We both have young children. 

Initially we both agreed that we weren’t looking for anything serious, however, things moved along pretty quickly. Fast forward about 6 weeks and we had discussed being exclusive, which was already basically implied anyway. He made a joke about calling himself my boyfriend more than once and I went along with it the last time and that was it. 

Throughout the 6 weeks, he made it very clear to me that he was over his divorce, has gone to therapy, worked on himself etc etc and that he was extremely into me and told me I’m important to him, and crazy about me. These words continued up until the day he “dumped” me.. we spent the weekend together and he seemed 100% normal, other than the fact that he left earlier than expected. 

The day he left, I didn’t hear from him (not normal, we texted all day every day) and I texted him in the evening to see how he was.. he gave a short answer and I just somehow instantly knew something was up. I started thinking about things and realized that he was somewhat distant that morning. So I asked him to call me and basically just said that I felt something was off and that I was in my head about it and asked if something changed. (Queue Anxious attachment style that I am actively working on!)

He reassured me that he was still in it, apologized for making me feel that things were off and said that I can ask him anytime so I don’t stress about it all day.. but I still knew from his tone that things were off. We didn’t text much that night. 

The next morning he texted me some nonsense and I replied once and that was it until the dreaded phone call in the afternoon. He called me and just said “you were right last night” and I was confused and asked him “about what” and he said “I’m just not ready to do this.” And I just said ok and that was the end of the call. 

The next day, I sent him a text asking him to help me understand what changed and he said that he realized he still had work to do on himself and didn’t like how he was becoming co-dependent again. I thanked him for being honest and agreed that I have some work to do as well. 

I initiated my divorced— I was checked out for a few years and I have no regrets, or real emotions about the divorce and I am in a good headspace about it. 

His ex left him and he mentioned that he was upset about it initially but reassured me he was at peace with it and realized he didn’t love her like he thought he did. 

So after all the background info I guess my question is this.. I prefer to date divorced men, with children since I feel like there is a mutual understanding. 
What could I have missed here? Surely there could have been some signs that he wasn’t ready, I’m just not able to think of any. Is it possible that somehow putting a label on us made him freaked out, even though he initiated it? 

His actions aligned with his words the entire time. I’m just confused about how quickly it changed for him… like a few hours before he left he told me that I am very important to him.. which he said often. 

Any thoughts or tips on how to date divorced men, or what to be on alert about? I’m extremely naive and inexperienced with dating.. I trust too easily and can’t seem understand how to move things at a slower pace.  

TLDR dated a freshly divorced dad that said he was ready to move on and got blindsided by him ending it. What are red flags I should look for when dating divorced men.

I just need to go on a rant quickly. I’m really upset  about the way this girl treated me today. I’ve been rejected lots of times and never pulled so I’m not upset about the rejection I’m just upset about the treatment it stings a lot. 


I met this girl 8 months ago off my female best friend. Then I bumped into her again on the street 6 months ago with one of my friends who is much older than me more and experience with women and is always pulling. My friend said she gave a lot of signals as when she saw me she fix herself up and flicked her hair and come over to talk and  he said she was making intensive eye contact when we talked and completely ignored my friend and was fidget with her hair. Tbh I didn’t notice any of this. 

My friend kept trying to convince me to make a move but I really didn’t believe it. I caved in around December and slide into her dms with story replies sending love eyes etc occasionally complimenting her e.g curly hair. We also talked about exams and music. After talking for a few weeks I asked for a hangout and she said sure she would let me know when she’s free. I knew it was already a no and soft rejection as if she was really interested she would have given a day she just didn’t want to say no in a rude way. So at that point I didn’t feel wanted and called it quits and  never went back in there again. 

I seen her today in the shop with my female best friend the same one who introduced me to her. Her body language was so bad she was just leaning in towards her friend her body language  was very closed off towards me. She never made eye contact with me once or even said hi and bye. She only spoke for like 45 seconds but I’m pretty sure if I wasn’t there it would have been longer. She acted like I didn’t exist. On the inside it made feel like I was trash. I don’t care that she didn’t want to hang out she entitled to surround herself with who she wants it’s just the way that I was treated hurt so badly. The whole time she was talking to my friend I felt like I was some disease she was trying to avoid. I just stayed silent cuz when I feel like I’m in a place I’m not wanted I’m not going to beg to be accepted. 

The other day I even got blocked after a girl asked me to send a photo of myself as she couldn’t remember what I looked like (meet from the club). 

People always say the worst you can get  is a no I’ve had some really harsh rejections that make me feel like shit. It’s not the rejection that hurt it’s the way they do it that hurt. I just wanted to rant as I feel like I’ve been bottling up lately and just the constant rejections are getting to me. I really feel like I will die alone and if I don’t it’s only because some girl will want to use me if I was to land a big job at a engineering company since I have really high grades and scholarships in uni I don’t feel like anyone will ever like me for myself or looks.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162853,public,self,(RANT) Upset about the way this girl treated me like I was some disease she was trying to avoid plus other tough rejections.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/t73ixo/rant_upset_about_the_way_this_girl_treated_me/,no_ads,0,,,

In hindsight, I should’ve realized something was wrong a few months into the relationship when he wasn’t as flirty, we talked less, but he was still in school and working so I know that life gets busy and I was understanding of that. I also didn’t get upset when he would cancel sometimes or didn’t have time. I also trusted him when my friends gave me weird looks for him having a best friend that’s a woman. I actually liked her and did my best effort to be friendly to her even though she didn’t seem that into being friendly. I feel like an idiot for thinking I could trust him. What hurt the most is that we were friends for over a year and he still didn’t any respect for me or decency. I would’ve understood if he came to me and said to me that he had feelings for his best friend, I would’ve accepted that and parted amicably but I had to find out from her. Her sending me texts, photos of them and saying I was in the way and she thought I should know. 

When I called him and asked him about it, he wasn’t even sorry. He said that I was boring and he wasn’t into it. It just completely crushed me because I thought he was my friend and he still did this to me.

So, let's get this shit-show started.

Background and characters of this show:
Me - Male, young, introverted, hates people, in a pretty good shape, quite depressed sometimes, overthinks a lot (My name is Samuel)
Girl - 5 years older then me, fun to talk with, extroverted, beautiful, sarcastic
Group of people - very large group(about 25 people) in which we are both in. Located in Sweden

Plot (pretty long, TLDR at the end): 

Initially, I was not even into her. I registered her as an older part of the group and was not talking to her. The group usually goes to drink some evenings. I am usually invited, but don't go there since, as stated up there, I don't like crowds and noise. One such evening, she asked me if I was coming with them and I just shakes it off with a ""lot of work"" maneuver. That happened two times after, and then I decided that I will try to go with them. She seemed pretty happy about it and cheered me up. We got to the pub, I ordered a non-alcoholic drink(wasn't quite in the mood) and just sat there. There was about 12 people in there and a lot of noise. I wasn't comfortable and just stayed quite for the entire hour. The girl was just talking to some other guys about something.
I left after an hour and went home.

Next thing that happened was after few weeks. The group(me and her included) went to a trip for a week. I was feeling good there, and the first evening, she even started a conversation with me and we talked for about 2 hours(I was mainly listening to her, but still). After that, we were pretty close for the rest of the trip; she sat next to me when there was an activity, she asked me to make her coffee. We even went out for a walk together. It was pretty enjoyable for me, and I started being into her in a more then just a friend way. Problem? When we were leaving the place, she didn't even say goodbye, just left. Don't know why, but I was pretty sad about it.

About a week after we left the trip, she just texted me on Facebook and actively initiated conversation again. I was texting to her, but I am not good at texting. I usually don't know how to respond to certain things meaningfully, so I just don't respond.

Last part would be my past relationships so you get a pretty full picture:

I was in two relationships before, one was very close and I genuinely loved the person. It ended with her dying in an accident and me going to psychiatry for 3 weeks with suicidal intents.

Second one was stupid. I dated a younger girl that had attachment problems. It started very quickly, and we got into a relationship in just a day. To be honest, we haven't known each other at all, and the relationship was based around physical attraction and sex. It ended in about a month but I was feeling very unfulfilled by that time.

Conclusion:
I don't know what to do. And I am scared to try initiating something because of several things:
- she is 5 years older then me
- she has a lot of male friends older then me and I think they are simply a better choice for her
- she could be just being friendly and I will end up like a guy that missinterpreted a lot of things
- I am scared that it will end quickly like my last relationship
- I don't know if I am in a condition that allows me to get into a romantic relationship

So yeah, that was my long ass vent. Hope I didn't waste that much of your time. If you have an opinion, you can put it in the comments and I will be very thankful for it along with any tips.

Furtherly, I want to apologize for any grammar/spelling mistakes. I am simply not in the mood to read it all again and fix them. Also, I can imagine that the writing is very inconsistent so sorry for that too.

TLDR: introverted young guy is probably missinterpreting signs from a 5 year older girl and is afraid to do anything.

Thanks for reading and I hope you all have a great day!

At first, conversation was started by both of us equally, with each making sure to take turns (without agreeing to/talking about the coincidence) saying ""good morning"" or checking in with a thoughtful question. The last week or so, I have been leading everything. Sometimes it's 4PM by the time I do to try to see if he will initiate, but I'm not in this to play games.

We have already spoken about what we each want from being on the app (which he asked and led with last week) and we both want something long-term and he has told me in no uncertain words that he likes talking to me and hanging with me when we virtually play video games and talk on discord.

Now, the main reason I'm writing this: I had surgery on both of my legs the morning of 3/4 and I have not heard from him at all since like middle of the day on 3/3. Not a well wish or a ""hope you have a restful sleep"" or a ""hope you got the good drugs ;)."" 

Did I expect too much to want him to check in on me about something so major in my life without me starting the conversation?

I know it's been 2 weeks of talking, but i have been absorbed by my nervous energy and preparation for my surgery pretty much that whole time. He knows how important it is; he's been aware from the first convo that I had an upcoming surgery and I'd be recovering for 6 weeks afterward.

Additional pertinent info: He got really busy at work this week so I have been leaving him to his own devices other than a single daily ""good morning; hope your day goes well"" text and maybe an update on what I am up to if there are messages from him to catch up on from the last time we spoke. We were also supposed to have our first in-person date earlier this week but he got hella distant day before and day of (he says bc of work and until proven otherwise it's what i'm believing). 

He did offer to meet halfway between us for drinks, but without a concrete time, place, and ride (cannot drive due to disabilities), I had to pass. He planned a virtual gaming sesh when he got home that night instead and we had fun, which he confirmed by text and vocally via discord.

I have limited dating experience, but from what I can tell this guy actually likes me right? If so, why do you think he didn't message me at all? It really hurt my feelings.

I (28F) have been separated from my daughter's dad for 6 years. I've had a few relationships in between, but never get to the point of moving in with someone.
I find that the majority of men I meet will go on a few dates with me and then give me the old 'not ready for something serious'. So I'm wondering, am I mentioning my daughter too soon? Often when I'm on a first date, I feel I'm starting off on the backfoot when they already know. Trying to convince them that I'm worthy, if you will. When they don't know, I feel like I'm lying to them, and I dread their reaction (getting dumped) the more I know them.
I just feel I'm never given a proper chance. I tend to date a lot older than me, to try to meet more mature men. Often, it doesn't make much difference.

22F, Year 3 Med Student (I live in Eastern Europe). Had a pretty sheltered life growing up (i had strict parents) and so my social skills were next to 0. Got into Med School, decided to turn things around and make more friends (and eventually find a boyfriend). Things were going pretty well, was even talking to a guy (he rejected me last November tho), but then CovID hit and I stayed fucking alone 2 whole years. 

A little more info about myself (so you can give me your best advice): i am a nice looking girl, i have a curvy figure (no, i am not overweight &amp; if a guy can be attracted by the sacks of fat attached on my chest, he'll manage the bit of muffin top that comes with them), i am a person with many interests (from literature to astronomy, to unique food combunations, then straight to fashion, skincare and makeup, i can basically hold any kind of conversation and i like to learn from those around me), i workout regulary, i am on the introverted side of the spectrum but i am working on this with a counselor, i had 3 different people in the last two months telling me how sweet of a person i am (so no, my personality is not repulsive). I am curious by nature and i start from the premise that we are all complex, multi-facetaded human beings who deserve to be treated with kindness and respect (i was massively bullied up until early adolecence and after making sense of what happend, i have made it my life mission to make people feel less alone, nobody get's left behind). 

Ok, I am doing pretty good in the platonic relationships sector. But when it comes to dating I have the skills of a toad. I have been rejected 3 times in the last 4-5 years, nobody ever told me that he has a crush on me, i  have never been asked on a date, i have never been kissed and at this point i am done with the situation. Currently I am trying my best at getting out there and meeting new people with similar interests (there are on campus meetings, but they are online and lately, everytime i hear the word ""zoom"" i throw up in my mouth a little). I am about to sign up for some volunteering next week, but that event is taking place this coming May sooo yeaahh.... i have the patience of a 5 year old... on crack.

Also, being rejected a few times so far (the first time was the worst and left some scars, but I am actively working on them) i was left in a place of ""i don't know what to do anymore"". That's why I am here. 

So, you're talking to a fairly attractive, introverted 22 year old who is asking for dating advice. Reddit, give me your best, give me your all and help me meet my fist boyfriend this year.

I just want to use the first date to get to know them a bit, have a fun back and forth conversation across a variety of topics, whereas I would only try to initiate more physical contact on the second and third dates. But I never even get the chance, because after the first date women either ghost me or tell me that they like me as a friend (and fwiw, they do emphasise that they had a good time and they think I'm a really nice person)

I do start and end every date with a hug, but It seems to me that women expect more degrees of physicality on a first date - playful touching, maybe even hand holding. I just can't do that with someone I don't know, however much I want to, as it seems so goddamn forced. I can't bring myself to touch them physically.

And somehow I'm the only person I know who this doesn't come naturally to. 

And this seems to be in contrast to what women say they want, which is a good mental connection. Frustratingly I think I generally achieve that. I just can't achieve the physicality, that I think is paradoxically expected even though- surely- women must know that in this age of gender politics it's a minefield and that men have to be very cautious.

I confronted him about this and his reasoning for not being upfront with her is because he doesn't want to reveal his life to her because its none of her business. she's a colleague and she's going to be curious and ask him a ton of questions about me and how we met and yadda yadda yadda.

Let me start off by saying that I have no intentions of doing anything about these feelings I can’t shake. I also feel like I’ve developed this crush because based on what I’ve noticed so far. He has a lot of qualities that I would want out of a partner that I find very attractive. He is very similar to my ex, but my ex wasn’t emotionally available so I ended things with him. He’s nerdy like myself and likes anime. He also has the reserved personality type I tend to go for.  But, this man is my manager, so I have no business doing anything anyway despite him being married or not. I really like my job and would like to keep it, so messing things up for myself financially is not the way to go. It just sucks that this person is there that you think would work amazing with you but they’re taken. I’ve tried to have minimal conversations with him cuz I have been really awkward and I think he might have noticed. But when we do have conversations they are great and my mind goes left. I have done many things to distract myself at work, like working or talking to the other co workers instead. Outside of work I workout watch shows and try to distract myself as much as possible. Last night I was hanging out with my friend having a good time and getting drinking. But the minute she left and I went to sleep, I dreamed about him asking me out. But I woke up and realized it was a dream and was upset. 
Not sure what else I can do besides try to find a partner for myself.

I don’t even want the hottest girls I JUST WANT SOMETHING. I hate my life the way it is now and women make it worse. I wish dating didn’t exist in the first place everytime I see people dating or even see a girl or a sex scene in a movie I want to kill myself. I want to kill myself. I get 0 matches on tinder, bumble and hinge. Girls are way to selective again when it comes to dating they can get whatever they fucking want. I’m don’t want to deal with the pain anymore everywhere I go is a reminder of how little girls think of me. Is it too much to ask for a girlfriend? FUCKING ANYTHING. I hate women

Hi! So I’m 26, I don’t know how to explain my situation, I guess I’m very good at making friends with women. For years I’ve been that guy people love around people, especially women are disappointed when everyone goes out for a drink and I don’t because I’ve got work, I tend to make people in general laugh and walk the edge of very risky humour/offending people but am never mean spirited, which is probably the reason I get away with the jokes all the time. 

My problem is I believe the problem is 100% on my end, I do all of this, but I never “flirt” or try my chances and just ask someone out, even if it’s just a coffee and a chat not really a date, I probably keep people at arms length with my personality, I joke around so much that when I do open up people tend to really listen and pity me because of my past and then I will make a joke about it all. Maybe I’m overwhelming “too much of a joker” I don’t know. But again I also just don’t tend to ask people out even as a friend. Which then just makes me more lonely and feel insecure and on top of all that then I will try and find solace online for sex or porn but usually feel worst after because of the porn or I don’t get laid or I just hookup with someone I genuinely wish I never wanted.

I think I jumped the gun a little too quickly and came off as a little awkward as well (I was kind of nervous). 

First off, I have never done this before, as I never felt this interested in someone. I'm not trying to say ""she could be the one"" or ""she's really special"", but there is something about her that I really like and I would like to know more about her. So, despite barely knowing her, I felt really compelled to get to know her even more and asked her if she thought it would be cool to hang out together, and she said yes, but left right afterward and I felt kind of embarrassed. I talked to her for a little bit the next day, but it was work-related and I didn't know what else to talk about given the circumstances, as we weren't going to be working together. She didn't give the impression that I weirded her out, and the way we talked to each other was still friendly. I think she said good morning to me (I've been so anxious this week that I can't recall all of the details), so if that were the case, I don't think I made things weird (hopefully not yet). Later on, with all of these feelings of anxiety and excitement, I wanted to know if she would like to hang out with me sooner rather than later. So, since it was a weekday, I asked her if she was going to be busy later, and apparently, she was. I then asked her if she would like to hang out sometime during the weekends, and she said sure, so I gave her a piece of paper with my number and sc user so she could let me know when she was interested. This may sound ok, but I think the execution was horrendous, as I was really nervous and I let out a ""well this sucks"" rather than a ""have a nice day"" or ""can't wait then""  because, well, the delivery felt kinda weak lol. After that, I realized I never asked her what her first name was, so now I feel like a fucked everything up in the end.

I also got the impression that she was pretty shy, which is why I wanted her to have my number instead of asking for her's; I wanted to give her some space while displaying an interest in her. However, I feel like I should've texted her first and set a time and place to meet up. I may not hear from her soon, in fact, I may not ever see her again, but what can I do in the future to confidently express my interest. If I had the confidence, I would've just told her "" I don't know what it is, but  I think there is something really interesting about you and I think it would be cool if he hung out and get to know each other.""

When he asked me what I was looking for I stupidly told him I just wanted a regular f buddy and he told me that “he could work with that”. However, after the first time we met, we hit it off really well and we’ve actually been on about 5 dates since. He texts me every day (even now that he’s on a vacation trip) and every time I leave his place he kisses me goodbye. Obviously I have developed feelings for him at this point and up until two days ago I was really scared to tell him how I felt, but I mustered up the courage.

I told him (over text cuz he’s away) “I know I originally told you I wanted something casual, but my feelings have changed since then and I wanted to know how you felt.”

He replied with “I’d rather talk about these things in person but obviously I really like you and enjoy your company, and I don’t want to see anybody else but I also don’t know if I want to be in a relationship either. There’s also the matter of you leaving for university in September (a 2 hour drive from the city we live in now) and I don’t know if long distance would work.”

I basically replied back by saying that I understand but I need to let him know that if he can’t see anything developing further than I cannot continue being casual with him (basically I can’t see him anymore because I will only get my heart broken even more.) I then told him that we could talk about it more in person when he comes back (we’re supposed to go out for my birthday next week).

He then replied by saying something along the lines of how of course he understands and he wants me to be comfortable and it’s good that I can communicate these things to him. We ended the conversation there and about 30 mins later he texted me back asking me about the exam I had the next day. He’s still continued texting me since, however he hasn’t brought the topic up again and I’m assuming it won’t be until we see each other in person. 

I’m just so confused how to move forward with this. I’ve never been in a relationship so I’m having a hard time understanding what the difference between being exclusive (and basically doing couply things) and being in a relationship is?

One of my friends who’s a very go with the flow type of girl told me that this is a good sign and shows his maturity because he does not want to jump into a relationship right away and that basically him wanting to be exclusive is us continuing to date and him trying to figure out if i’m the type of person he wants to be in a relationship with.

It has been 6 months and I still can't get her out of my head.


So I'm 24(F) and the girl I'm talking about is also 24(F).
6 months back,I was on a solo road trip and I was in this city which is 800kms away from my place. 
I met this girl let's call her A at a gay bar in the evening.
She was hanging out with her friends and I was just figuring out what I was going to do with my night. 
Anyway,I ended up talking to them and we just had a spark. You know? Her friends got it as well.
So they tried to leave her alone w me. Anyway they came back eventually and we spent rest of the time at the club together.  We ended up kissing (I asked her if I could kiss her) and later on we parted ways.
But the kiss was really electric you know?
Anyway we parted ways at the end of the night.


The next morning she texted me and I did too.
We made plans to meet up as they were leaving later on.
We couldn't meet on our own cause they were travelling as a trio bestfriend weekend. But she invited me to join them for lunch. We held each other's hand all the damn time.
There was a pride parade(the chances right?) That morning and we did that together as well.


Anyway she left that evening and I eventually went back home too. I didn't think much would happen as we lived 800 kms away from each other.
But we started texting..
And the long paragraphs of what we like,what we don't like,what happened during the day,and what shows we like and life etc.
We did that for a week and I told her during these conversations that I had to travel to another country for a few months cause I had some work left to do.

She invited me over saying that they are going to celebrating one of the girl from the bestfriend trios birthday in a neighboring city and I should come.
Her friend invited me as well.

I thought about it. It was 600kms one way. It's a long long drive. And I just met her that once. But I was like I didn't want to miss out on the chance of real love.
 I went.

We had rented a 2bedroom airbnb.
We met in the evening and had a dinner with her and her friends.
It was fine,we were holding hands. And I held her by her waist a couple of times(I asked her if it was okay with her).
Later the same night we met,we went back to our airbnb.

She came into the room after talking to her friends and told me she is going to take the couch.
I was utterly shocked.
I mean I had told her that if at any point she was uncomfortable,I would be happy to take the couch and that I had absolutely no expectations of something happening.
But yeah,I ended up spending two nights on the couch.


The whole weekend she acted like I was some stranger who was tagging along on their bestfriend trip.
I mean her friends were so nice. They kept talking to me and making sure that I don't feel like an outsider.
One of them only spoke French but I had more conversations with her than my date(can you imagine)

I ended up breaking in front of her friend and her friend told me she told her that she is not feeling the way she thought she would for me.

Okay. Cool.
 More than the pain of being rejected was the fact that she didn't tell me this herself?


She acted like a fuckin stranger.  Like all of it was in my head.
I had those long intense text conversations w her.
I had that kiss with her.
I drove 1200 kms for HER 


I mean,I don't know why but this stayed with me.

She never even texted me after that weekend,I just drunk texted her once saying she didn't have to do me like that.
And she apologized.
That's that.

I don't know why but it still gives me these really sad feelings whenever I think about her. Maybe cause I was getting these butterflies and feeling that oh this could be something.

I'm in a happy relationship now.
But still sometimes when I think back to her or the weekend,I feel extremely sad.

I told my bestfriend about it ,like it was just one week. 
Why is this bothering me so much?

It has been 6 months and I still can't get her out of my head.


So I'm 24(F) and the girl I'm talking about is also 24(F).
6 months back,I was on a solo road trip and I was in this city which is 800kms away from my place. 
I met this girl let's call her A at a gay bar in the evening.
She was hanging out with her friends and I was just figuring out what I was going to do with my night. 
Anyway,I ended up talking to them and we just had a spark. You know? Her friends got it as well.
So they tried to leave her alone w me. Anyway they came back eventually and we spent rest of the time at the club together.  We ended up kissing (I asked her if I could kiss her) and later on we parted ways.
But the kiss was really electric you know?
Anyway we parted ways at the end of the night.


The next morning she texted me and I did too.
We made plans to meet up as they were leaving later on.
We couldn't meet on our own cause they were travelling as a trio bestfriend weekend. But she invited me to join them for lunch. We held each other's hand all the damn time.
There was a pride parade(the chances right?) That morning and we did that together as well.


Anyway she left that evening and I eventually went back home too. I didn't think much would happen as we lived 800 kms away from each other.
But we started texting..
And the long paragraphs of what we like,what we don't like,what happened during the day,and what shows we like and life etc.
We did that for a week and I told her during these conversations that I had to travel to another country for a few months cause I had some work left to do.

She invited me over saying that they are going to celebrating one of the girl from the bestfriend trios birthday in a neighboring city and I should come.
Her friend invited me as well.

I thought about it. It was 600kms one way. It's a long long drive. And I just met her that once. But I was like I didn't want to miss out on the chance of real love.
 I went.

We had rented a 2bedroom airbnb.
We met in the evening and had a dinner with her and her friends.
It was fine,we were holding hands. And I held her by her waist a couple of times(I asked her if it was okay with her).
Later the same night we met,we went back to our airbnb.

She came into the room after talking to her friends and told me she is going to take the couch.
I was utterly shocked.
I mean I had told her that if at any point she was uncomfortable,I would be happy to take the couch and that I had absolutely no expectations of something happening.
But yeah,I ended up spending two nights on the couch.


The whole weekend she acted like I was some stranger who was tagging along on their bestfriend trip.
I mean her friends were so nice. They kept talking to me and making sure that I don't feel like an outsider.
One of them only spoke French but I had more conversations with her than my date(can you imagine)

I ended up breaking in front of her friend and her friend told me she told her that she is not feeling the way she thought she would for me.

Okay. Cool.
 More than the pain of being rejected was the fact that she didn't tell me this herself?


She acted like a fuckin stranger.  Like all of it was in my head.
I had those long intense text conversations w her.
I had that kiss with her.
I drove 1200 kms for HER 


I mean,I don't know why but this stayed with me.

She never even texted me after that weekend,I just drunk texted her once saying she didn't have to do me like that.
And she apologized.
That's that.

I don't know why but it still gives me these really sad feelings whenever I think about her. Maybe cause I was getting these butterflies and feeling that oh this could be something.

I'm in a happy relationship now.
But still sometimes when I think back to her or the weekend,I feel extremely sad.

I told my bestfriend about it ,like it was just one week. 
Why is this bothering me so much?


Thank you for reading so much if you did. I just wanted the entire story to be heard and understood.
Please give me advice or answers.

His shift starts when mine ends so we don't work at the same time. One thing I noticed is he makes very serious eye contact with me and I have caught him glancing at me a few times.
