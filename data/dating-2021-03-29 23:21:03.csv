0,mg7r1o,1617078064,Going back and forth on dating apps,"I've been going back and forth on dating apps and if I should get back into them. I felt like, after having bad luck with no matches, people just stopping having conversations with me after talking to them, and people just looking for social media followers, I felt like I should leave apps behind. That I need to actually talk to people in the real world in order to get genuine connections. I felt like I used apps to not have to risk talking to someone who at best wouldn't match up with me or could turn out to be a horrible person. I think that I adopted a shallow mentality that made me very picky about who I swiped right on. Like looking for food with the right ingredients at the shop.

&amp;#x200B;

But then, I thought that I could do both and it doesn't have to be mutually exclusive. To take a chance on someone who doesn't seem like would be a good match but could turn out to be a good friend bear minimum. I've changed a lot in my mentality in recent years and I think I've generally matured and would also be a wonderful person to be around.

What is the meaning behind the most asked questions by females 

Do you drive
How tall are you
Do you smoke weed

What does this mean?,"Me (21F) and a guy (22M) were hooking up casually for a while, we were friends and study the same thing in school. We spent a decent amount of time together. However, I got involved with someone and kind of broke off contact with him, since it felt weird to be talking to both of them. He wished me merry christmas and new years and we talked for a bit, but that was our last conversation. Recently me and the person I was involved with decided to break things off and I found myself kind of missing this guy, so I chose to text him. I asked him how he was and he answered. I asked if he wanted to hang out sometime and he said: ”For sure! I am a bit busy in the next few days but I’ll let you know.” Now.... this is not my first rodeo. Usually an answer like that is a nice way of saying no, but I can’t help hoping he will get back to me.

4,mg8cfm,1617080370,Not sure if I'm not interested in dating- or if I'm afraid.,"I'll elaborate on the title... I am kind of struggling with this lately. Pretty much I'll talk to guys I know or guys from tinder and I'll be interested for a few days and then suddenly lose interest and my conversations with them turn boring. Sometimes I stop responding or they stop responding because I put in no effort. Or from the get go I don't want to answer them and have to force myself to. Every once in a while I feel lonely and get upset about being alone but it's not often. I miss the intimacy that comes with being with someone, but it's like I don't want to talk to anyone to get it. 

I guess it would also help to elaborate on my past relationships. My first boyfriend cheated on me after 2 years. My second boyfriend was talking to another girl and at one point hurt me. My third boyfriend cheated on me and my fourth relationship involved physical and verbal/emotional abuse. That lasted 4 years and I was single for 2 years after I finally got out. During that time I was friends with a guy and finally last year him and I started dating. It was a LDR. 

He was nice enough. Not a bad guy. But never gave me attention or really treated me like a girlfriend. Most of the time he continued to treat me how he did when we were friends. We recently broke up in December and I find myself over the breakup but Im not over how I felt like he made my concerns feel minimal and that I always overreacted to everything. I tried to change how I was for him and I finally realized he wasn't changing anything. 

I'm glad it ended but I'm so mad at myself. I let myself be treated poorly even though I tell myself I won't. So I'm just stuck feeling like I want to be with someone but then when someone shows me interest I just completely don't care at that point. I'm so confused. I'm not sure if I want a relationship and I'm putting up walls when that's possible or if I am not interested in a relationship right now and should just drop it.

I follow covid guidelines, and he is aware that I work in healthcare where risk of getting the virus is low due to the pt population.

He hasn’t even mentioned a socially distanced date, we live in the same town. But he seems to want to wait till he is fully vaccinated (will be by the end of this yr) — even though i believe the risk for getting covid will still be present, there just wont be deathly consequences. Why would a socially distanced or even a video call date be bad? 

We’ll still have the risk of getting covid post-vaccine is what i’m trying to say.

It just feels so effortful to keep this messaging up, i’m bored. What if we meet a yr from now and the chemistry isnt there.. thats a whole yr wasted keeping this up.

I had socially distanced dates last year summer and havent had guys act like this.

At first glance, this article seemed pretty bs. But then they did run some tests. In these tests, they gathered a group of women. And the researchers showed each woman two pictures of fairly attractive men. One picture was of a guy smiling, and the other was of a guy not smiling. Majority of the women voted the broody looking man more attractive. But one thing this paper doesn't take into account is social presence. In an actual social gathering, the women claimed they are more likely to approach the smiling man than the broody man because he seems more approachable.

So my bf and I have been dating for a little over a year and a half, and up to a few months ago it's been amazing.

He said something about having a fight with a friend he was staying the night with. And he left later the same day since it was 2 am. I stayed up all night with him. And got to see him for like 3 hours then he was gone. It's been 4 months, since he left we haven't talked much, and I really miss him. At first he said he was leaving only for a few weeks, then it turned into a month, then it turned quickly into 4 months with him gone. He sometimes sends me stuff. And since now he has a traveling job we both agreed I just keep stuff I want to give him in a box to give to him when he comes back. He says he wants to move back so we can actually start a life together. But I'm not sure he is telling the truth since he hasn't the last times he said he wanted to come back. I really love him, our relationship before he left was absolutely amazing. He never really lied or basically played me like this before, so I'm not sure why it suddenly started. I staight up told him before if he ever even truly thought about cheating to just end things between us, and he said he would never cheat because he knows how it feels to be cheated on and never wants me to feel that. I'm not sure what to do at this point. I've tried conversation starters, schedules to call or text, ignoring him to get him to actually talk. And he only calls me for less than a minute in the mornings and rarely after that. I truly have no clue what else to do at this point. Any advice or like different point of views would be amazing. I just only see my point of view and that could be a problem because maybe I'm seeing the wrong view. I love him so much. And I think he is the one. I just don't understand.

25,mgbzp8,1617096315,Help with a problem on Tinder,"Hello! So, I had been on Tinder for a while, and I've met with one person on there but besides that I haven't had much luck. I also tend to overthink things and get self conscious a lot, so after having my account on Tinder for a while I wondered if I were to change up my bio and photos I was using, if that would help with finding more and better people on the app like me. Well, I did that, just the problem was that I had been on the app long enough that I didn't have anymore new people who were actually in the area popping up for me anymore. So, I came up with the great idea to instead just create a new tinder and start over, and see where that takes me. So, with my ""great"" idea, I deleted my account and went to make a new one, and when trying to use my number again it said I could not. I looked this up and I found other tinder users saying that making new accounts with the same number are not allowed by the app, and that you'll usually have problems and have your account banned if you do so. So, if you were to start over with a tinder account, you would have to change some things with how you set up your account and access it if you don't want it to get banned. It sounds complicated, but seeing how much more active Tinder has been for me compared to other apps I have used in my area, and I guess because of its better results and matches, I think it'd be worth it to try this. 

tl;dr
So, finally, long story short, I am wanting to make a new tinder account but I need another number to create this account with, and I don't know anyone who I'd really be comfortable asking nor do I have any other phone number, and online number generators haven't worked. Would anyone be okay with letting me use their number for making my account, I think the only thing I'll ever need or use the number for will be authenticating my account when I first make it, and then after that I wouldn't need to use it again.

If anyone would be comfortable and willing to help me with this, I really would appreciate it so much!! Just DM if you would like to help and we can get it done hopefully quickly and simply.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mgbzp8/help_with_a_problem_on_tinder/

This past weekend I traveled to Charlotte to meet up with a guy I met when I was out with my friends in Chicago a couple years back. We met on the dance floor, made out a few times that night and realized that unfortunately he lived super far away so we couldn't really start dating. Since we met the first time, I've only seen him one other time when he visited Chicago this past summer on a work trip. I sort of blew him off on that trip since I was seeing someone else (very early stages) at the time. I told him that we were going to do all these fun activities, but I had a one track mind with this new guy, so we only got dinner once. We stopped talking for a few months until he reached out to see how I was. I apologized profusely and let him know what the situation was at the time. A couple more weeks go by and he suggests I visit Charlotte to escape the cold. I agree and let him know when I'm going to book my ticket.

So this part is sort of important. Before I book my ticket I send him a text saying ""I'm not so sure I should visit you in Charlotte. I of course want to see you but I'm in a stage in my life where I'm trying to be more serious so don't want to overcomplicate things by going. Not really trying to mess around anymore so wanted to let you know what I was thinking."" He responds by saying something along the lines of, I totally understand and wouldn't want you to feel uncomfortable. My intentions were not that you could come as a trial to see if we would start dating or anything like that, because the distance is a real thing. I figured at the very least you could have a good time in Charlotte. 

Just for some context, I've had a pretty rough year of dating and what I said is true. I don't want to be used for a booty call or anything like that. This guy is super nice and a complete gentlemen so I never would have expected that to be the case, but wanted let him know my thoughts.

So, I thought that response was nice so I booked my ticket. I flew there last weekend and overall the trip was fun. We did lots of things, he paid for everything which was not something I expected, met some of his friends, overall had fun. The one thing is... he didn't touch me the whole time. We even slept in the same bed and there was zero spooning, light touching, anything! This is something that is pretty new to me so it left me feeling pretty shit about myself. It didn't exactly add up to his behavior because he seemed like he was into it, but then when it came time to unwind and go to bed he just laid next to me without a single touch. 

So I guess that's what my question is. My assumption is that he's not very into me and sees me only as a friend which is completely fair! I guess I just assumed most guys would probably be into having sex when there's a (pretty attractive, in my opinion) girl next to them. Either way, not a totally big deal since we live so far anyways. It's a tough pill to swallow but I'll be okay! I do wonder if that text had anything to do with it but I'm not sure. Maybe he misread it? Or maybe he's just not attracted to me at all, lol. Either way, I left very confused.

Anyways, thanks for your help. :) Any type of feedback would be helpful!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mgdhny/was_he_just_not_that_into_me/

We met online cause we live far away from each other (basically in different states), but as I found him funny and nice I kept on talking to him. Over the course of the days, he started talking more and more, to the point of being on phone talking for more than five hours and enjoying our time together, as close as we can despite the distance. But one day he told me that he had a long distance partner some years ago, and he cheated on her. He said he felt remorseful, and regretted that a lot. When I first got invested in him it was because he continuously told me he's a traditional man and he expects to eventually marry and form a family. But now I feel I can't keep on the interaction on the same level, I'm kind of filled with fear that he might do the same with me cause I'm also away. I've suffered in the past and I don't want to repeat the story. I don't know what to do.

39,mgfwgp,1617110496,I [M23] don’t know what to do with my coworker [F21],"We work together, she has a boyfriend and I respect that, I’m just getting mixed signals from her.

I’ve tried to distance myself from her since she started seeing her current boyfriend, but she makes it difficult.

We both work part time whilst at College, it’s just minimum wage supermarket work.
I only see her once or twice a week.

I catch her looking at me constantly at work, if I see her there’s a good chance she’s looking at me. 
I catch her looking at my hands or the veins on my arms, she looks me up and down.

I try to not initiate conversations as much but if I don’t she does.
If she sees me, and I don’t say hi, she does.

It’s never small talk.
If I walk in her direction she bursts into a conversation, it’s great because there’s never a dull moment, but it’s not what I need right now. 

One that stands out was a conversation where she was saying ‘imaging moving to the city, you’ve got a great job sorted, a lovely house, happily married with kids and then they start picking up that dreadful accent!’
So I pretendingly said ‘alright kids that it get in the car, your mother and I are moving you back to (my home town)!’
She laughed and said ‘or (her home town)’.

There’s been other occasions, she’s asked me what’s the youngest I’d date (this is before the boyfriend), I said maybe 20, but that could be weird it’d depend, I asked how old she was and she replied ‘oh I’m 20 but I’m 21 soon’, she was 21 6 months later. 

I know I missed a chance with her almost a year ago now, I didn’t realise she was asking if I was going to this event because she was genuinely curious or because she wanted to meet me there.
I never got her number, I never made plans and I was disappointed when I didn’t see her there.
I’m guessing she was disappointed I didn’t try to.

The reason I’m trying to distance myself is frankly it’s hard being around her when I know she’s happy with someone who’s not me.
She met her boyfriend at work, I remember hearing her giggling when she got a text from him after he had asked for her number.

I can’t just hang around her and burn up.
I won’t be quitting my job.

I can’t say anything because it’ll make it awkward.

Awkward because I don’t even know where exactly I stand with her.. 
part of me thinks ‘it’s just friends that’s all it’s ever been’,
Part of me thinks about how coworkers have joked that it’s like we’re dating, my supervisor who I’m friends with constantly makes jokes about it/us.

She’s lovely, and I like her but I find it hard being around her in this capacity.

And the gist of it was she doesn't know where her job will take her she is a dancer and ended up moving to boston after studying in NY b/c of a job opportunity.

I know that I want something serious in the long term but thinking about right now, I really like her and have fun spending time with her.

42,mggnos,1617112720,Unsure what is going on with person I'm [28F] dating [34M]?,"So I went on a first date with a guy beginning of february, and that weekend he flew to another country. We kept in contact over text and phone pretty casually, but then it kind of escalated to talking to each other pretty much daily texting and then calls every 2-3 days initiated on both sides. This lasted 1.5 months, and he came back 2 weeks ago.

&amp;#x200B;

We saw each other since for some beers and ended up kissing. We had a great date just 2 days ago where we walked, and played, and kissed - he even made lunch and dinner for us!

Now he's in the process of moving (so I guess he's super busy)- but in general I feel like I am not special to him/ there's no affection. We have great conversations, and I really like kissing him, but I feel like there is a general lack of affection and, for me, therefore clarity. 

&amp;#x200B;

Like - wtf is going on here. Yes - I'm a relationship person but I mostly want to know what the fuck is going on, does he even like me, and put some thoughts into words ('I really like talking to you and would like to see where this goes'). That hasn't really happened and maybe I'm too much of a wussy to ask because I'm not sure the moment is right, or the vibes are right, but yeah. I also do not really want to have the 'are we exclusive'/ are we bf/gf talk because I feel like it's too early?

52,mgilcb,1617118169,Unsure whether my ex-boyfriend (35M) is still interested or if I (26F) should block and move on. Advice?,"I’ve been dating this guy for about 8/9 months. We’re 9 years apart and I don’t notice the age difference. 34m, 25f. We get along like a house on fire, always laughing together. He tells me regularly ‘I laugh so much with you’, I know his friends, his family know about me but we haven’t been able to meet due to Covid. He used to call his parents every Sunday but since we’ve been dating, it’s become less and less. We normally see each other a few times a week, sometimes less or more depending on our schedule. He invites me to all the 'big' things in his life, for example, we were going to go to his medical ball together (he would've been seen with me in front of other girls if there is anything nefarious). When we drive or hangout in different areas together, he likes to look up the prices of houses. He's also said in front of me how cute kids are and that he can't wait to do that one day. Signs to me he's testing my reaction and seeing if I want that as well.

A few months into dating, he asked to make sure that we’re not seeing other people. He isn’t into casual sex and I think exclusivity is important to him. A few months ago I was anxious about what we were - he hadn’t asked me to be his girlfriend and I thought this is something that he would’ve wanted to do. He’s traditional, wanting something serious such as marriage/family. We had a few talks about the direction of our relationship, he said there were a few things he was a bit concerned about, a few things we maybe didn’t have in common (he’s very risk-averse and overthinks everything).

He’s studying so after that conversation he said he would decide at the end of his exams, his exams have finished now. He went away recently with some of his University friends, he was unsure of whether to go (seemed like he wanted to be with me, haha) and wanted to see me before he left. I’ve felt good about everything between us post-exams as I had a feeling he was going to slowly contact me less and less and try and see me less - due to his uncertainty.

One night on the phone, I told him that I wasn’t quite sure whether continuing to have sex with him was a wise idea as we aren’t boyfriend/girlfriend. He was confused that I said it was casual. I said ‘well, we aren’t in a relationship’ and he said ‘you are my girlfriend’ I’m certain he went onto say ’I thought we’ve known this since we started dating’ so I then asked him ‘well if I was to meet a new friend of yours that I haven’t met, would you introduce me as your girlfriend? And he said yes. Unfortunately, he has to repeat his exams so I may not be able to see him for a while, I do need to clarify that he actually meant this.I just wonder why he had this hesitancy a few times when we had the discussion a few months back though? There was even a point where I suggested we should end things because he wasn't so sure and he agreed. Maybe this is natural though and a reflection of his risk-averse attitude about things. There were just some uncertainties on his part. He said he could've been overthinking it. As a result, it sort of made me more anxious and I suggested we should end it.

He said it’ll be good to have a proper chat about things as we’ve both been putting things off, as so he said.

I got to his house, he said yes I have been his girlfriend all along and he doesn't know why I would think otherwise. He said that he feels it’s not going to work because of our age gap and he claims we're very different people. I personally do not see this as I feel like we share the same values, we're compatible in a lot of areas etc. He told me that he finds me beautiful, loves my sense of humour and that we get along and have fun together. I did mention that we handle conflict differently but our only arguments have been over text/call and since that's such a poor form of communication - it's hard to tell.

He started to cry (this is the most emotion I've seen from him), saying he won't be able to cook me any more dinners and our memories shared together. He then went back and forth and said he doesn't know if he's making the right decision, that he will never find someone like me, I am out of his league etc. He said maybe he's just one big idiot after all and he's made a stupid decision. I was calm in my response and he said ""why don't you get angry? this is making it more difficult"" in a somewhat cute way. He just kept saying that lately everything has been solidified in his brain that it's probably the most responsible decision. He asked me if I thought he was being unreasonable.

Now I feel like since we've been arguing quite a bit the past few weeks and he's been stressed, possibly his decision is skewed. I hadn't seen him in 2 or 3 weeks due to exams and I asked whether maybe we just got cold feet because of us not seeing each other. I remember months ago he said he sometimes questions us in absence.

We spent over 4 hours talking and it was like he didn't want me to leave nor did I. He then asked if we should go to dinner together. He finally walked me to my car and he couldn't stop crying.

Something in me decided to message him the other morning after I left:Me - Morning 📷 I don’t know if messaging you is the best idea, but I hope you haven’t woken up too sad. If you ever want to catch up on neutral grounds, a coffee or lunch, don’t hesitate - I still consider you a friend. Even under these circumstances, it was nice to see you last night and I am saddened I won’t be able to have more of them with you. That’s all 📷Him - Morning! I was in two minds as to whether to message you with the same sentiment 📷 I feel very much the same. Like you say it’s always nice seeing you, and it’s hard for me to think we won’t be sharing more moments together. I really hope you’re feeling ok today 📷 Enjoy the rest of your weekend 📷Me - Aw, well if you’re keen to catch up in a week to come or a few months, let me know. I’m trying to not make this any harder for us but it is difficult. I didn’t react with anger because that’s genuinely not how I feel about us. I miss you, enjoy your morning eggs 📷Him - Will do 📷 miss you too, at least you can have your eggs with olive oil today 📷Me - These thoughts are best discussed in person but I’m not sure if that can happen and they’re weighing heavy on me. I do think we could work through the issues as I feel there are more positives than negatives. I am aware that the past few weeks have been pretty nasty for the both of us but I’ve been particularly harsh on you. If I don’t hear back from you, I will, of course, assume you do not feel the same way and will accept your decision.Him - I thought I did explain that although the last month or so has been really difficult, it hasn’t been the main reason why I reached the decision I did. Of course I’m always really happy to talk to you about anything though, so if you still want to talk things through naturally I’m happy to do that 📷He went onto say that he hates that he's upset me and that it's all really difficult for him but he **thinks** it's all for the best.

We caught up and went to the beach together. We had a good time, he just feels at the moment he thinks it’s the best decision, although he isn’t fully confident he’s doing the right thing. He said maybe in a year it’ll make more sense and we realise we’re fit for each other. He said that he told his mother we broke up and she got really angry. Something was quite odd, he told me his friend (who I know) broke up with his girlfriend but they’re back together. We then went back to his for a cup of tea and we talked a bit more. He admitted that he does get in his head a lot and could be overthinking things. Said again that he's scared he's going to lose someone amazing but feels it's the right decision **right now**. Again, I feel because I've been arguing with him over text lately and he feels overwhelmed. When I left, he said he wants to see me again in a week or 2.

We spoke on the phone and I told him it’s really painful catching up with him and I don’t want to feel like an option to him or being left on the back burner, he said that wasn’t his intention and he would never do that as he has too much respect for me. He said it was hard catching up with me recently as well. He said he agreed to catching up because he felt like it was something I wanted. We spoke a bit more and he said that if he has a change of heart in the future, he won’t just sit on it. He’ll tell me. He told me he hopes I know how beautiful I actually am.

He ended up calling/messaging me over Christmas and NYE. I do feel like I am the one who predominately initiates contact with him first, I’ve been sending him sort of lengthy messages and he claims he’s overwhelmed by it. Recently we’ve been having an hour or so conversations when we usually would never have that as he was never one to speak on the phone. He expressed doubts about our break up as per usual and said he’s probably one big idiot after all. He told me he’s been on 2 dates with 2 girls as I asked, said he’s sort of interested but it hasn’t gone anywhere. I was quite upset and he assured me he wants to stay single for a while, he also said it’s not like he even wants a relationship with them. He said to give me some context that there were girls before we met that he was interested but it didn’t go anywhere. I was quite offended because he went on dates with girls that he basically broke up with me for. He broke up with me over an age gap but then went on dates with girls my age? Makes no sense. He said it’s all really regrettable and then told me that it's not that he wants a relationship with these people and said they’re just friends he wanted to get to know better. He said he wishes I could see his phone. Near the end of the phone call, he got teary about the fact he thinks I'm so sweet and don't deserve this.

He said over a month ago that a catch up would be good to clear the air. He also wouldn’t directly answer the question when I asked if he just sees me as a friend. I’ve decided to pull back, but it seems like he wants to catch up. At the start of this month, he offered to call about something, I think he was sort of surprised by that as I usually am jumping at any chance for us to speak on the phone. He sent me a message about the date/time tba (which I didn't respond to) and then he sent me a follow up message about a week later saying “Morning, when works this week for you?” with a smiley face. He then said whenever is fine, to choose a day/evening and let him know. He then said he hopes my mother is doing okay. This was 2 weeks ago and I didn't responded. He sent me another message 2 weeks later saying he hadn’t heard from me in a while, was wondering how I am and asked if my mother is okay. I replied and I was friendly, but brief. He replied and said a few things and then said ‘we never caught up in the end, let me know if you would still like to’ we talked a bit more and then I told him that I feel he just wants to catch up to free himself from guilt and that we can only catch up if we both feel it’s best for us to be together. He responded with saying that he understands and he didn’t think it would still be really difficult but he understands and there is a bit of truth in wanting to free himself but he thought it would be healthy in general. Apologised for the pain he’s caused me and wished me all the best. I told him that I just felt him talking about clearing the air was ominous and I just wanted to have dinner with him and not talk about us. He said that he understands how that could have caused it and apologies and said it’s the furthest from how he wanted to make me feel. I didn't respond and that was 3 weeks ago now.

\*\*TL;DR\*\* ex-boyfriend broke up with me in November 2020. He cried a lot that day. He's expressed doubt and says he's probably one big idiot regarding his decision. We caught up a week after we broke up but I've decided to not see him for my own reasons. Lately he's been initiating more contact and has been quite persistent in catching up with me but conditions the catch up as 'clearing the air'.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mgilcb/unsure_whether_my_exboyfriend_35m_is_still/

I have this guy who I met off a dating app in 2019, we dated for a month but broke it off because we had sex for the first time and it was awkward and i didnt feel that we were sexually compatible. We ended up getting back together 2 more times because I thought the sex would improve but let just say he doesnt have the right equipment for me. The last time we were together was last year and he has been messaging me on and off since then begging to be with me and saying that he wants to marry me and have kids.

54,mgiynx,1617119197,It’s complicated.... not in they way you think.,"Ok so let me start off at the beginning. I [21M] met this girl [20F] a few months ago on discord, we hit it off really well but had little time to talk because of the major time difference. But we made it work, come to find out there is more to it then just that. She lives in Dubai, and she was raised as a Muslim. Her parents very strict and the only time she is happy is when she is talking to me, but in order for that to happen she has to stay up super late and talk while the house is asleep.

Before this point I’ve already had feelings for her, and would do anything it took to see her. Now comes the real issue, I want to bring her to the states to get away from her life she hates so much. There is a lot more that she deals with than I am saying but I would like to keep that private for the time being. The reason why it’s such a huge endeavor is I have to travel to Dubai, make friends with the family and father, then ask her for her hand in marriage (We already both do want that).

This already seems hard, but to top it all off it is a custom to give money and gifts to the family. The travel, stay and everything else is going to be super expensive already, but we do have some time. She knows she won’t be married off for at leased 8 months, and you can bet I’ve been saving every penny that I have. You might see a gofundme floating around soon with more about it, I am not asking for money here. I just need some positive words and/or advise on the subject.

57,mgjh41,1617120491,I hate dating apps,"This isn't your regular person venting about not getting any matches or dates. I'm taking this into a different perspective as someone in the lgbtq community on dating apps.

First, I'm nonbinary, bisexual, and asexual. All things that have sparked some anger in matches. Mainly the asexual part which I understand why but still, have some respect people. I've never had a problem with getting matches either, I would say I'm a 7 maybe even an 8 on a good day.

People on dating apps are horrible. There's men who aren't very attractive or in shape and yet they expect me to be attractive and in shape. There's women who will text for a few hours then disappear and never speak again. There's couples who think I will have a threesome with them. There's people ""just looking for friends"". And don't even get me started on the people with no bio or those who don't even read my bio (swipe right on everyone yay!) and then get surprised when they see something they don't like.

As a nonbinary person who uses she/they pronouns, men are usually the ones asking ""why don't you just say you're a woman?"" because I'm somehow trying to be ""different"". They also refuse to accept the nonbinary part and continue to refer to me as a woman, girlfriend, female with bobs and vegana etc. after countless explanations that I do not entirely identify as female. As a bisexual person, I am expected to have threesomes or have a high body count which makes me ""gross"". This obviously isn't true and I'm not your threesome fetish. As an asexual, almost everyone thinks that I'm a virgin or that I hate sex or haven't had ""good sex"". I find it especially disgusting when men message me saying ""you just haven't had sex with me yet"". Yes that's true, I haven't had sex with you and I probably never will after that. Don't even get me started on the people who hate any and every part of the lgbtq community and think it's okay to threaten or belittle us.

My experience may be entirely different from someone who is just like me and they may love dating apps. I live in a suburban area and it's mostly conservative (not trying to be political, just many people put this in their bio so it's obvious). Being on dating apps has just shown me how horrible and judgemental people can be. I was even surprised when I matched with people from high school and found out how rude they actually are.

Needless to say, I have had some good connections with people that didn't really lead to anything but at least they were kind and accepting. I do want to be on dating apps as they're my only way of connecting with others right now but a part of me thinks it's better to just focus on school and my job. After all, there's only a few months until my campus opens up again and I may end up making better connections then.

60,mgjnq5,1617120983,How should I proceed with this girl I've been dating?,"Been hanging out with a girl for a while now and maybe I'm just overthinking everything but I feel as if our energy has shifted and although we've still hung out at least once a week during the past 2 weeks she's been flaking on me a little more than usual. 

1st time: we had planned to hang on a weeknight, but she had some personal issues come up and ""just wanted to be alone"". She called me later that night and we hung out for my bday that weekend.

On my birthday a couple weeks ago she took me out to eat and got me a present. She also brought up ""what are we?"" to align on where we are to which we agreed we'd just keep hanging out. She also slept at my place that night. 

2nd time: to be fair I asked her if she wanted to hang out on the same day I texted her and she said she had work to do that evening. 

3rd time: we hung out the night before and agreed to hang the next day. The next day comes around and she got her 2nd covid shot that morning. She was feeling tired but more or less promised to hang out the next week before she leaves for a long trip.

Last night I went on the phone with her and we talked about our days like usual and I asked her if she could hang out Wednesday before she leaves, she said ""yeah, we'll see not 100% yet"" and didn't really give a real excuse as to why. 

I got annoyed by this response and called her an hour later to talk and asked her ""hey, I've noticed a shift in energy between us since we had the ""what are we"" talk?"" ""Is there anything you'd like to tell me"". She basically said that no there's nothing wrong, we're still good and that she's been going through some personal stuff that's made her more irratable but it's not directed towards me.  

Idk, is it too early for me to make a decision to ask her if anything else is going on?

Should I text her the day we might hang out this week to see if she still wants to hang out?

The following relationship I had was awful, manipulative and had a terrible aftermath - but in the last two months or so, almost weekly he would tell me I deserved better. It took a long time to agree with him after the break up (even though he treated me poorly... all part of the manipulation I guess) and the one after that was short lived but followed a similar route. 

Then - I find better. My match. He's smart, funny, kind, makes an effort to communicate, emotionally available, we agree on so many fundamental principles, he accepts my personal circumstances like no one else ever has and I fall for him! But he's with someone else, and after 6 months of the ""talking stage,"" (between us), he is getting serious with her. We agree to be friends but things have changed, obviously. And now, the ""you deserve better"" speech comes along. My heart hurts. 

I did deserve better, and I found better in him. He's my person, but he's not. I swear I'm not perfect, so I can't deserve better than every one I've met. My heart really hurts, i can't concentrate.

64,mgkbwh,1617122807,"I’ve always told myself I’m not friends with women because one of us will probably fall for each other, but do you think I could safely be friends with this woman?","I went on one date with an older more mature beautiful woman. We had a first date that lasted 12 hours and we had great stimulating conversations the entire time no awkward silences. She invited me back to her place after I took her to a few bars and we shared a bottle of wine. I pulled her in and started to make out with her and she pulled me into her bed. She kept jumping on top of me and even put oils on my body at one point and although kissing was out of synch I still enjoyed it because she was super cool and beautiful. Although I was enjoying our make out sesh something within me was holding me back from escalating when I know she wanted me to as she kept jumping on top of me in the bed kissing me all over, I just couldn’t take her clothes off and get on with it even though part of me wanted to. The next morning she ended up telling me there’s not romantic attraction on her part which was partly confusing because she was all over me the night before but I suppose my hesitation could have turned her off. She said although there’s no romantic attraction she had a ton of fun with me and would love to have me in her life as a friend. Anyways regardless of all of this, and that being the best first date I’ve ever been on by far and her being super hot, she was completely honest with her history and she explicitly told me she has never been able to keep hold of a relationship longer than 6 months and she dumps everyone so i don’t think of her as a relationship prospect for me. So although I am attracted to her intensely I don’t think I could ever date her because she seems she could be quite cold when it comes to long term romantic relationships and ends them rather quickly. I’m thinking because I’m not trying to get into a relationship right now anyways especially with her, that I could maybe be friends with her but I am also attracted to her so this is new territory for me. I guess I would like to know if I’m still possibly going to get hurt in the end even though I know deep down dating her would be painful without a doubt and that’s not in the cards anyways. Is being friends in hopes of dating the only thing that hurts you in the end? I’m thinking since I don’t have that hope I should be fine but I can’t deny I’m sexually attracted to her, Has anyone been friends with someone of the opposite sex in a circumstance similar to this?

I got engaged super young and after that split I got into another serious relationship right away. From 18 to 26 I had those 2 relationships, fully committed except for about 6 weeks. So when I was single again at 26 I took a year to figure out who I am on my own. I've had mental health issues since I was a kid  for the first time in my life I started to like myself. I had fun, went on the camping trips my exes would never let me go on, met new friends and my career started improving. Then I met someone new.

It blew up in less than 6 months. I blamed myself at first, but now I see it's actually a shared issue. Our worst qualities fed off each other and we wound up unhealthy. Now all I'm upset about is that I launched myself into yet another commitment instead of just enjoying my own company.

I'm at the age where I thought it would all be coming together if I did things right. Frankly, it's great that none of it did because I'd still be unhappy  and running on that same emotional treadmill. I now go to therapy, I just got a massive promotion at work, I'm planning a ton of camping trips for the summer, I cook what I want, and no one guilt trips me when I want a lazy Saturday after my 60 hour work week. I even called a couple schools to look at finishing my bachelor's. People around me are going out of their way to tell me they notice my energy and it feels amazing.

I think women notice it too, because I've never had them pursue me before and now I'm getting asked out to dates. I've only went on a few, but they've all been great because I don't care what happens, I'm not on a timeline. I have great plans for myself and if someone happens to be going the same way, I'll be thrilled to enjoy it while it lasts. I'm done changing for any reason other than making my life better.

I would quite like that in person interaction rather than just messaging out to people online.

I have never had a girlfriend which in some ways knocks me a bit but overall I feel I will be fine once I find out how I can find a platform or way to actually get to talk to women in the 1st place.  I only ever really feel comfortable once I get to know people properly first rather than feeling like I am forced to get to know them on a 1st date.

76,mgm1su,1617127451,Should I (M24) be worried about my GF's (F23) Guy Friend,"GF and I have been dating for three months.

Shortly before we started dating, she hooked up with a longtime best friend of hers from highscool. He's a very good looking guy, and something about him I just don't trust. He himself is in a very committed relationship, but nonetheless.

My GF is always trying to get him to come hang out with us -- as in invites him to every gathering we have -- the other day he texted her to come check out his friends apt on a Saturday night, and she convinced our entire group of 10 to travel 30 minutes just to go to some place with this guy and his friend. She must have been staring at him the whole time, even as she lied on my chest. At one point he even called her out the room and they dissapeared for five minutes or so. I also felt like i noticed her stick her foot out to touch his knee to grab his attention, but didnt say anything, they just looked at eachother.

I also feel like whenever she facetimes him, she has to leave the room. The one time i was bed with her when she answered, she angled her phone towards me as if to alert him that I was there (Though that may be paranoia.. idk) Another time, I was wondering where she went t cause it had been a while since she left us and our friends in the living room, and I find her downstairs face timing this guy. She immediatley goes ""Hey im just charging my phone""...

When she first mentioned that they hooked up, she said she only gave him a blowjob because ""He's slept with so many people, why would i ever want to be one of them"" --- That to me is the biggest red flag of it all. Like who says that...

The thing is... This guy does and is doing alot better than my gf if im being totally honest. to the point where I dont really think he is all that into her, and more just saw it as an easy way to get a blowjob. My concern is that my gf has some feelings for him, that extend beyond their freindship. I think she is embarrassed or ashamed to confront those feelings because he has a not so great history (Went to prison for a couple of years)

Is it worth inquiring about whether or not she has some unresolved feelings for this guy? Or, does this just make me look weak and insecure. On the other hand, do I not both asking and just break up with her to save myself from any trouble this causes down the road. I dont want to lose her, I'm having a great time -- but i also dont want to actively disresepct myself.

Also, this girl likes me ALOT.. like alot alot. Is it really possible to be that into somebody and still have feelings for someone else? Is it ok for that to be a thing? I dont want to ask her to stop seeing this guy entirely, i dont want to be like that.

My question is, if you were on a profile and saw someone had a 5 min video intro, would you watch it? Is this a good idea to help me stand out or is there something I'm missing and no one would click on it?

Just curious. Now that I think about it, im not even sure if I could get the URL on the page.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mgmm6y/whats_your_opinion_on_a_5_min_dating_profile_video/

As lockdown in the UK is starting to wind down (permanently I hope🥲) I am starting to get back out there a little bit as its safer (online chit chat mainly for now).

I am 20 so in the grand scheme of things it is quite a young age to have had a parent die, it happened a few years ago now and I am at peace with the situation (although still greiving as I will probably be for a long time). The parents/family question almost always comes up in first dates but as a young person, I typically find that a lot of the people I tell aren't well equipped to handle the answer of my mother being dead, many of us are only starting to realise that our grandparents are finite beings!

My mothers death does not define me, nor do I have a complex about the situation. I just need an effective way to tell people without causing an awkward situation. If anyone with a similar experience could let me know how you approach it, it'd be greatly appreciated :)

Apologies for the long post and thank you.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mgn56d/how_to_bring_up_parental_death/

89,mgne4o,1617131099,Should you tell your crush/boyfriend you once created a fake profile and send him a message just so he would receive a notification and come online to reply to your real profile because you thought it took him so long?,"I did this in the first/second month we first started talking on an app (not a dating app and we never met each other in real life). My only goal was that he would get a notification on his phone (I didn’t even think he would reply to the fake profile because I had no profile pic but he did and I felt so bad and regretted what I did). It’s just so stupid and I wish I’ve never done it. I see it as a big lesson I learned from and I would never do it again, the amount of anxiety it gave me is something I would never want to experience again. At the time I thought we would stop talking to each other and never meet. However, we still talk every day and I really enjoy and I feel like we really get along. He is also coming to my country in a couple of months for his work. 
I just feel like a bad person and that I just should stop talking to him because of what I did.

90,mgnedm,1617131117,I despite men that dip after hooking up just once,"I'm talking about men who ""like the challenge"" and as soon as they completed their goal they dip, I hate this for 2 reasons:

1. They view women as if we are a game, and totally disregard the way this makes us feel, whether or not we caught feelings, we just feel discarded now, this is very obviously a case of not viewing us as human beings.
2. They're not even interested in hooking up again because the ""challenge"" is over, you'd think it'd be easy for a girl to at least find a steady FWB but no you get one time only with these people. Leaving me frustrated as hell

And what I hate most is that you can't even spot it, you never know until after you fuck them if they're gonna dip or not, I'm not even looking for a relationship just for someone to stay around. Anyone have any tips on how to know beforehand? And also guys, why do you do this?

91,mgno67,1617131861,What do you think?,"So a couple of weeks ago this girl hmu and asked for my insta, we were chatting for a couple of days and seemed to have a lot in common. She was in Russia when she first contacted me so when she got back she had to quarantine for a couple weeks before we could meet.

Over those two weeks we conversed pretty casually but she would leave me on read for hours and sometimes for a couple of days. This was already red flags as not even a week after we met she already didn't seem very enthusiastic about speaking. She knows how I look and said ""cute😆"" so I was left with the impression she was interested.

She said the reason she didn't respond for awhile was because she took a break from insta for a few days and every time we spoke she would ask questions and seemed interested. Last time we spoke she said she took a break from insta and said she wasn't feeling well and a couple days later she deleted all her posts on insta. I asked if her day was alright and no response.

 Like 2 days after, I saw she changed her profile picture but didn't respond to the text I sent her so again I think she's lost interest, but last time we spoke she seemed to be having fun talking. I asked if she wanted to go out the following week cause her quarantine would be over and she said sure so I was looking forward to it. I purposed for Tuesday but she said she didn't know when exactly and that she would hmu to tell me when she's free. So far still nothing. Yesterday I asked if she's down to meet up in city cause I would be there on Wednesday and no response, not even read.

In my opinion I think she is just ghosting but seems odd cause of the amount of times she said she took a break from insta because she wasn't feeling well but imo that could've just been an excuse. The thing that really makes me think there's something more is because she deleted all her insta photos because she generally seemed interested and why would she still show interest even after 2 weeks.

Idk kinda stuck on what to do. Another set of eyes on the situation would be appreciated thanks.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mgno67/what_do_you_think/
92,mgnofo,1617131882,how to tell the guy i'm dating i dont have much experience and am bisexual," 

Hi there! I (30F) have starting going out with a guy friend of mine. It's going great so far. We haven't had sex yet, but i would like to have sex with him. However, I have never had sex with a man and really want to take things one step at a time.

Long story short- I was really mentally unwell in my 20s and mostly avoided relationships/sex (+ kind of afraid of men). I started dating more in my late 20s and had one girlfriend for 5 months. I've kissed 2 other guys but have never had sex with a man.  
I would like to tell this to the guy I'm going out with because I feel good and safe with him, but I'm not sure how to tell him or how he will react to my bisexuality and lack of experience. Any thoughts?

Like she would post some pic that could potentially make you jealous. But then she would make a comment to someone else saying ""I posted the pic because of (some unrelated reason)"". In this instance, if you can be certain the comment is actually geared toward you, is it pretty likely she is indeed trying to make you jealous?

98,mgoue3,1617135084,Is this considered cheating?,"Hey, I wanted to ask if this is considered cheating.....

Disclaimer: my bf says that we were not together but asked me to be his girlfriend (again for second time little over 2 weeks ago). He has acted like a bf, told me that he didn’t want anyone else 2 days prior, sent me a bunch of love messages and asked me if we were together and I said yes..... now he’s refusing to acknowledge that and denying it..... 

Here’s my experience- 


There was this girl  he went out with in his past (3 years ago maybe)....  when they were young. He kept her on the bottom  of Snapchat and she decided to chat with him and ask him how he was doing with a “☺️” . He claims she was trying to be nice since it’s been a while since they went on a date. Hey let’s say I doubt she knows about me although he posts about me sometimes (maybe he hid his story from her.) 

You could tell that she wanted a conversation so he saw the chat (slide it) and I had to beg him to either  block or simply unadd as it made me uncomfy they had a past. He didn’t for at least an hour and got tired of me... this made me extremely nervous and I got the gut feeling he had smth for her.
 it took a few hours but he ended up blocking her. 


After that he started thinking about her and he claimed that it was the devil (were Christian) Putting in lustful thoughts. He told me that he was thinking of her kissing him with me in the room (I absolutely got so uncomfortable.) i wanted a 1 man relationship with him only. 


He then started having reoccurring feelings come back and it finally stopped. He then came to me said he had a dream about a girl he wouldn’t tell me who the girl was and he lied. He said that in the dream I cheated so he cheated back as a result. A few weeks down the line he told me that the girl was HER . he said sorry for lying I forgave him. 


He said that he keeps dreaming about her. I checked her Instagram and he kept following her. Sidenote : he never wanted me to know her name he told me last name I found out on my own. I asked him “can you kindly Unfollow because you’ve been following this girl and you’ve been having feelings for her and I don’t want this to disrupt our relationship.” 

He couldn’t I asked him many times and he couldn’t. I saw him in person  and he got uncomfortable when I said it again; the whole time at the park he was talking about his life and her and who she was and what she was doing. We didn’t talk about me once. She was the WHOLE CONVO !! 

He finally unfollowed her and blocked her for me. He told me that he was doing this as a vow for God and that he couldn’t idolize her anymore. He said he would not  do it for me (says sin feels good he would not stop). It kind of makes me wonder if God wasn’t around he would’ve kept her around.  


Days later.... (keep in mind he makes very impulsive decisions and decided to unblock her whenever he’s mad at me) 


She then posted on her story and he ended up unblocking (had a mini fight because he was acting rude). She posted a pic of her and he told me it took every ounce in his body not to screenshot the picture even though he has a gf. 

He says that he could never imagine marrying her or loving her but he had his eye on her. Every time he fights with me he always says that she’s the DEFAULT SETTING  and he always runs back to her whenever we fight. 

Let u in on some backstory he’s broken up with me talked to another girl and FaceTime her and then got back with me because he realized he didn’t want her and she wasn’t right for him (yes borderline cheating even though he keeps making it obvious he wasn’t “mine”) 


Regardless of the other girls in the past that he broke up to talk to  and then got back to me with she’s always on his mind. In a fight that we had when I just told him my feelings but what I thought he claims that I’m a liar ignorant selfish and disruptive. 

He unblocked her and add her back on Snapchat as well. She then send a streak (he does not do streaks )and he sent one back of the ceiling. I said what was your motive to add her back and he said hurt. He could not tell me why. So he runs to the girls when he’s hurt.


 At the end of it he told me he needed another outlet to go to and girls relieved that output. He said that with a personal issue he thought God was leaving him therefore he wanted to get payback at God which I’d never condone.

After all this he’s basically running to woman every time he gets in a fight with me always trying to run away from me and when I confronted him and said they are always talking to other people he admitted to it and actually said sorry but I’m not ready to take that. 



Is this really cheating or am I blowing this out of proportion???
