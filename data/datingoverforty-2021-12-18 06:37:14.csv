2,rj99vw,1639839835,The pre-holiday slowwww down...,"Thoughts on this?  I've been dating a guy for 2 months. We have an amazing time together, are very affectionate, go one dates several times a week, have great chemistry, there's mutual effort, and our high sex drives are super compatible. The one area that is a bit different than other guys I've dated is that we don't text a whole lot. We will communicate if we are making plans, and sometimes we will chat in the evening or have some sexy talk, but we definitely don't text back and forth all day. I felt secure enough in the dynamic to not need constant reassurance via text so that's been awesome.  The way he acts in person tells me everything I need to know.

However, I've noticed that in the past week there's been a significant slowdown in communication. He's been telling me that work is super busy, which I definitely believe, but he always made time for me in the past when he was busy, so this is a little different. He has told me in the past that sometimes when he's stressed he just shuts his brain off and doesn't really communicate and just works and sleeps. I get that, been there. He works 7 days a week usually, 13 hours a day.  It's a lot! But I've also asked him to just keep me in the loop so I don't feel like I'm bothering him or whatever. I can definitely give him space when he needs it, but if he doesn't let me know what's going on, I feel very lost and it does trigger some anxiety. He said he totally understood and things got much better after that. But now it seems to be happening again. It's been about 5 days of super limited communication, mostly initiated by me.  We texted like two sentences to each other a couple days ago but nothing since, and no plans have been made for the week even though we both mentioned doing something.

So I'm not really sure if this is a pre-holiday thing with being busy, or if this is him just backing off for good. It seems very strange because although we didn't feel the need to define the relationship yet, I feel very confident that we are heading in the right direction and not seeing other people, etc.  Of course, it only takes someone a few seconds to text, but I have definitely been in that mindset before where I don't feel like talking to anyone. 

And I get it - I've read a million posts on here about the whole texting dilemma and the anxiety that comes from it. I've been working super hard on my attachment and have improved so much, but old habits die hard. I'm a strong independent person and I know what I deserve, but every once in a while the anxiety creeps in and it's hard to push it away.  I'm just worried that the momentum we've been building is going to suffer, and it bums me out.  

This definitely isn't a ,""Girl, he's not that into you!"" situation. I'm not worried about that - I know he is lol. At this point it just seems like it's just a waiting game.  He will either re-engage or he won't. There's not much I can do about it other than to stay busy, right?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/rj99vw/the_preholiday_slowwww_down/

We got along great, loved to do the same things, but I just never felt an intense ""spark"" and there were a few red flags in terms of LTR (she was still considering having kids, I'm past that point in my life).  Anyway, I broke up with her earlier this week.  It was hard for me to do.  I've been on the receiving end of this kind of breakup and it's rough.    Anyway,  she was, understandably, upset.  Called me some not so nice names, etc.  Still, I'm concerned about her.  Is there anything I could do to help?

5,rjbbjx,1639845994,"Houses, not Cars","My message this morning for the red flag brigade- please stop treating people with certain issues like a car endangering others on the road. I'd like to put forth an alternate analogy- people 40+ are not cars, but rather we are houses, and for every house, no matter in the condition or location, there is someone out there who finds its attractive features outweigh its problems. 

Cars have have red flag issues. Maybe the brake pads are worn thin, the tires are going bald, the oil hasn't been changed in years and it's wearing down the engine. These are problems. If you get on the road with your ""issues"" you put yourself at risk, or worse put others at risk. That's bad. 

Houses don't endanger anyone. You can live in pretty much any house, whether they have foundation or electrical issues, and even in a bad location. You will very rarely die. No 40+ house is ever ""fixed""- there is always something that needs to be replaced or upgraded. It's all about what a buyer is willing to live with and work on. There is a whole range of buyers out there, and who cares if 99.9% pass it by- a house only needs to find one willing person who loves it.

A personal example- are you are woman with kids going through a divorce? Feel like a hot mess and not ready to get out there? You may be a perfect match for me. We will be able to bond over some similar things. So don't listen to the haters telling you to ""fix yourself.""

8,rjca02,1639848781,I canceled because he was just way too low effort,"Today I'm celebrating my boundaries and honoring my 'spidey senses' about someone who asked to reconnect with me. 

I recently have been embodying the standard of ""match their effort and interest"" instead of offering more than I'm receiving (in this case, in terms of communication, initiating conversation, and date planning). 

Someone asked to meet me again (we had met first a couple years ago), but in the time between first contact and the potential date I noticed that I was offering up interesting details about myself (when they aren't asking questions that demonstrate interest), and doing the prompting to make the date plan while he was keeping it very vague and using words like ""meet up"". The last straw was his lack of communication the day before our tentative, continued vague date plans, (due to work constraints which is understandable but also another example in a series of ways he demonstrated being pretty unavailable), and then he STILL hadn't firmed up plans the day of the date, and then he asks me to choose something to do because he ""doesn't know the town very well"".  So I canceled. 

I have spent a lot of my dating life being willing to pursue men I'm interested in, putting in more effort than them. I'm just over that and so relieved! I do my best to share enough of myself to peak interest and show that I'm available and friendly, but if he isn't taking the bait and matching me in that way, I'm gonna walk. Yes, I want to be pursued. It isn't about playing games or making it complicated, it's about the person demonstrating mutual interest and effort. My personal work on my self-esteem helps me to have healthier boundaries when people aren't meeting me where I am at. I think I'm pretty cool and I want someone to agree! 

Maybe this post will generate some conversation around asking someone out and then expecting them to plan it? The mental load of getting to know someone and planning events? About your level of interest and how that relates to how much effort you demonstrate? About how your improved self-esteem has improved your dating standards?

Good luck out there, everyone!

Any tips on that front? Most friends are in relationships and socialising is often never with anyone new or the potential to meet someone new.

I've always dated men to whom I felt incredibly attracted. And yes, it never works out, eventually.

Looking back, I always felt so 'lucky' to be with these particular men. But did they ever feel lucky to be with me? Was I ever as quietly charismatic to them, as they were to me?

As I peruse my options on OLD, I find I am talking myself into plainer types of men, or, trying to overlook this feature or that in an effort to not be so shallow.

Partly because it makes me think  that maybe they would feel lucky to be with me, for a change, and what would that be like?

I have been dating a boy for 7 months, frankly I have never seen anything that makes me think that he sees himself with other women, however, in our conversations when he refers to the women of his past, he describes them as saying things like: his body, how cute they are and how much he came to like them.

I do not know, if he does it unconsciously, I mentioned it once, but insecurity is drowning me, this has never happened to me with a boy, I even think that everyone avoids talking about the physical of their ex-partners, they only talk about the Lived experience
