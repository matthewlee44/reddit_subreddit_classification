He and I talked for a few weeks and then we went on our first date last weekend. I had a really great time, I see boyfriend material in him, and I really thought he liked me too. He had said “I hope we hang out enough so that…” and after I left the date, he texted me saying he had fun and would love to see me again soon. 

With guys, I tend to get attached quick and then overthink the entire situation. Like if he is seeing other people, is he gonna like me, etc. and that definitely happened after our first date. However, I do like him, so I decided to ask him a few days ago if he’d like to do something this weekend. He said that he would love to see me again soon, and that he’s free this weekend if I wanna see him. I told him I was free Saturday night from work, and he said he’d let me know but that should work.
We text throughout the day, but he hasn’t mentioned anything about that weekend so I asked him a few hours ago if he’d still want to do something tonight.  He said that he’d like to but he had some anxiety issues earlier and hasn’t been feeling well since then, and that he was sorry for being inconsiderate for not mentioning it. But no follow up, or reschedule. 

This has happened with every guy I’ve liked, and I just don’t understand why he would do it too. Is it something I’m doing wrong? Should I even be that upset about it? It’s just annoying because he showed an interest in me, and we already established we are both looking for relationships, so what does this mean now

I just do really like him, and I don’t want to feel insecure about this connection like I am, but this definitely does not help it. I don’t want to just be throwing away a good thing here, or self sabotage if I’m way overreacting. 
And I know that we have been on one date, he doesn’t owe me anything obviously, but I still would like to be treated the way I deserve in a potential partner and not have to question how the other person is feeling.

He said he felt so comfortable with me that his train of thought just came out verbally. Then, he urged me to look at a Twitter profile of a friend of his, and when I did, there were videos of him and that guy on the profile. Then, he had some USB drives in a drawer and told me I could look at them anytime I wanted. So, I decided to one day, and there was some commercial porn stuff, but there was also a LOT of homemade porn, starting him and other people (some one on one stuff and a lot of heavy group stuff). I freaked out. It hurt so bad to see that, like BAD. He said he had forgotten those were there. He has always had two phones, a “regular” phone and a “booty call phone”, and refused to discontinue the latter, not matter how uncomfortable it made me. While all of this is happening, he emotionally withdrew from me. He shut down. So, I packed up and left. We talked, and he promised he would work on things. Three weeks later, he has done nothing. No progress toward seeking therapy, hasn’t deleted a single picture or video, hasn’t deleted his old hook up’s contact info…nothing. He said he “hadn’t had time”. So, at that conversation, I said goodbye. I am not ok. He is the love of my life, and he chose mementoes of his old lifestyle, things that harm me, over me and us.

Well anyways, after we broke up, I started talking to this girl and it made me realize that I was able to like someone else, and could start to imagine my life without my long-term ex-girlfriend. We met online, and it made me really happy to talk to her. She was smart, funny, and pretty and I would eagerly wait for texts back. We decided we wanted to meet each other in person, which was way out of my comfort zone but I really wanted to meet her so I agreed to do it.

I was super nervous to meet her, and my heart was racing and my hands were shaky as I parked my car. I got less nervous over the course of the date, but still nervous because I didn't want to mess anything up because I really liked her, more so now that I met her. Since I was nervous, I was hesitant to do things, like sit on her bed with her, or touch her hand, or flirt too much. 

When I left, I told her I enjoyed the time we spent together which was the truth, and told her I would like to meet again, in which she agreed.  I thought it went pretty well even though I was nervous. The day after we met, I texted her to say I was sorry for being nervous and a bit hesitant because I wasn't sure what her boundaries were, and that I would be less nervous and awkward next time, and I didn't have to be as nervous as I was. 

Then she basically told me I wanted to take things too slow for her, and would be a better fit for someone who also wanted that, and she wanted to take bigger steps than I did.  She said she was open to meeting again but it would be better if we were just friends. I said that if she didn't like me how I liked her than I didn't want to push anything, and we probably shouldn't meet. She said we can still text but I think that probably won't be good for me. I'm just not sure the size steps I should have taken. I'm just so used to being in a relationship for a while so I don't know what to do with new people. 

I just hate that I pushed myself really far out of my comfort zone and it still wasn't enough. And I thought she wanted to meet again because that's what she said and I just get blindsided. I don't think I could do something like this again. 

How do I know what steps to take with someone I just met? I just don't know what to do and I fell everything from my breakup all over again.

Once I knew about her, I backed off a little. I started to miss him and one night his GIRLFRIEND was in the hospital so he asked me up to his room. He asked to cuddle but I felt guilty and said NO so we didn't do any sex or cuddling...just awkwardly laid next to each other.

I told him ""the only reason you're asking me to cuddle now is because your GF is in the hospital"". He said that wasn't true...yet the NEXT day he pulls up in his car with her and he's taking her into his room!!

He hasn't asked me to hang out in a couple of months now. I'm really lonely. I can hear his GIRLFRIEND next door tonight actually.

Short version :- I am in love with a girl who is in love with someone else. It's been a week since I found out and i can't get out of my depression pit. Any solutions.

Long Version :- I became friends with this girl who i work with in a company for about a year now ,we both started here around same time. Since we work closely in a small team and both were new in town with not many friends outside work ,we started hanging out outside of work.
 I started developing feelings for her in a few months but when I tried to make my feelings apparent she started drifting away and our hangouts and non work conversations became less often to the point the point of being minimal right now.
 From the beginning i noticed that she was very close to one her college guy friend but whenever i asked about him she was always dismissive and somewhat secretive. He lives in a different city but they chat a lot all day and talk on calls late night(recent revelation ,did not know in the beginning). He visited her once and stayed at her place for the night (in retrospect i should have figured this out earlier).
 Now she has cutoff ties with me to the point that our relationship is strictly professional and i recently found out that they are dating.
 To be clear i do not want to be with this girl ,i know better than that. I just want to get over her , which is difficult because i see her almost every day. It's been a week since all this happend.
I have been trying to forget about her , think about other girls at work ,even getting on tinder and wanting to talk to a cute girl at my gym. But it seems like i am not interested in any of that. I don't want chat with my tinder matches ,i don't bother to even look at the gym girl when she is checking me out and i am trying to avoid this other girl at my work who actually likes me and keeps messaging about random things. 
Also i don't drink and there's only so much caffeine &amp; nicotine can do. I do get short bout's of clarity and relief sometimes about how stupid i am being and i can get over her ,i have gotten over my past 3 relationships and i have no residual feelings for any of them.

I am now 27 (just turned), and I need to go back to when I was 17 to begin. And to begin with, I should mention while my dad works for a major corporation there were and are several medical professionals in my family and sprinkled throughout my relatives. My mother is an RN, and two of her sisters are as well, I also have two of my four sisters who have become RN's. This fact about nursing is paramount to my experiences. 

When I was 17 I did well in my high school studies and there were two things I wanted to do in my life back then: Travel around the world and have a career somewhere within STEM. Through high school, while I would never grace a cover of GQ, I never worried about my looks, as I did date and did have a couple of girlfriends. I am a bit athletic and did play both hockey and baseball, now it is CrossFit along with autumn basketball and summer softball, but I plan to get back into hockey once this damn pandemic ends and leagues can safely start up again.  

But with that said, at 17, I was in the summer leading into and looking forward to my senior year in high school, I expressed to one of my RN aunts my desire to travel. But how could I since travel cost big bucks? And from her, and for the first time ever I heard the term, travel nurse. Go anywhere in the country as a nurse, get paid serious money, have your housing (hotel) paid for while you work wherever it was you had gone. And the best part she told me was this, you can get your nurse's license in two years through a junior college. Since my mother and her sisters all earned at least bachelor's degrees, this also was news to me. However, I investigated this throughout that summer and discovered I could in fact just after two years not only gain a nursing license, but at the age of 20, I could walk into a nursing job here in Boston that paid just a tick under 40k to start. A year later I was waiting to begin nursing school at a local junior college, and through the help of my mother that summer I was hired as a part-time orderly at her teaching hospital. And that is when my eyes began to open to the possibilities of what it meant to be a straight guy in the world of 90% women. Because once I began working as an orderly and it became known I would be going to school for nursing, I met female nursing students, nurses, along with, yes, both female medical students and doctors (medical students &amp; doctors showed up once I was a nurse) and others in other departments at the hospital, who, once they understood I was straight, they became ‘friendly,’ and I soon found myself becoming popular. And even before I reached 21 and could join others for drinks, no guy gracing a GQ cover could have done better in dating.  

     And once having graduated and passed my boards I was hired by my hospital for the ER/ED night shift. And I was straight up told by both HR &amp; the nursing director that I, being only an associate degree graduate nurse was hired for the night opening mostly because they wanted more of a male presence in the ER at night, and if I did not cut it, I would be working a medical or orthopedic floor. Seventy-year-old security guards and maybe one other male staff nurse or orderly (I did work the ER before this as an orderly numerous times) were never enough, especially on weekends. Anyway, I remained in the ER for two years for the experience before finally making the move to becoming a travel nurse. And at the age of 23 and working a lot of overtime at the hospitals I signed contracts with let me pull down 120k in salary. The downside is, there are no real benefits beyond the pay. And in the end, this is what I have learned for guys who want to date with an eye towards marriage and being able to at the same time support a family once they do. 

1. Being a straight and single guy as a nurse is very appealing to many women, but you do have to shrug off the idea that some people will believe your gay or bi-sexual. There is no good in getting mad over it, as you will become mad fifty times a year if you do not just let it wash off your back. 
2. You will be mistaken for a doctor or medical student every single day. 
3. Even as an 18 to 20-year-old nursing student, if you just remain a straight-up guy, not nasty or a pansy, or a game player, but just be a regular honest guy then other nursing students, as well as nurses and other women in the various medical fields will be attracted to you. And unlike myself, as I planned all along to be a travel nurse, which once learned of thinned my opportunities, you, I promise you, will have a field full of choices on who to date and possibly come to marry. 
4. By the time you graduate school or start in as a nurse, you will find yourself being proposed marriage to at least once. But beware of such proposals, as that girl just might see you as one of the items off her bucket list of life to check off. 
5. You will discover some female classmates or female co-workers at the hospital wanting to have a relationship with you, and there is nothing wrong with that, but so will those who already have boyfriends, and sadly beyond these, you might find the engaged, along with some married do as well. Don't become scum, just let these losers pass. 
6. If you, as I did, ever choose to become a traveler, #5 above becomes even more prevalent in female behavior, as even the engaged or married female medical students and doctors understand you will be long gone and away for good after your contract ends, so they will make the offer of having a tryst while you happen to be at their hospital. And do not think some of these women will not give you a going away, remember me by present in the form of a STD, and some will be of the permanent kind. I know a couple of male travel nurses who carry such life-long reminders from their travel dalliances. 
7. There will always be several 'free spirits' who do not have a boyfriend or husband or who are not engaged and will become interested in you. So, you will never need to bother with the married, almost married, or those already in a relationship. 
8. In the end, I hope something similar that happened to me when I was 25 and working my first week after signing a 12-week contract in a New Mexico Hospital ED will happen to you. Because 19 months ago, a shapely, 26-year-old brown-eyed, brunet beauty who worked at this hospital as a physician's assistant, and at age 11, found herself immigrating to the United States with her parents and 2 siblings from Italy. Her father was an executive with a major Italian corporation at the time and was offered, and he accepted a promotion that required he move, and move his family to of all places, Boston. Well back to NM now. This eye-catching beauty came to the ED for her back to work Covid-19 test after taking vacation back in Boston for over a week. This was a test she was required to undergo 24 hours before being allowed back to work. Since I was working the testing room that morning, I had the task of administering the swab. And the moment she heard my accent as I greeted her and told her I would be taking the swab, this gorgeous vision smiled and asked if I were from Boston. Things for us took off from there. And just so you will know, I now sit a bit south of Boston within the 'TV room' ending this writing at 11:53 pm on November 13 while my beautiful Italian wife of now 28 days lays asleep upstairs. So, in the end, this is what I say. I never intended nursing as a life-long career, but only a means to an end. But that said, I will also tell you, it is a great profession for guys. And as for me, in these now nearly seven years as a nurse, I have worked in ER’s, ICUs of various kinds, and in the OR in a dozen different states. I been to Italy, and two months ago did a two-week Mediterranean cruise that went from Spain to France to parts of Italy, Greece and Turkey as a honeymoon. And maybe I will never end up with a career in IT, I now seriously doubt I will, but in this moment, this is what I know; if it were not for my Aunt Pam telling me about travel nurses and how I would be making nearly 40k at age 20 and right out of junior college, I would have missed my greatest blessing. So, I now offer what I did simply as a possibility for any guy who wants to find girl to love and marry. You will have in nursing a secure career that can and will support a wife and future family and offers mobility as well. And if not for heeding my aunt's advice, I would not now be sitting here typing all this out with the biggest smile on my face while knowing the greatest advice I ever received not only saw that at 20, I entered a field that paid a tick under 40k, satisfied a good portion of my wanderlust, but best of all, as I said, led to the greatest gift and blessing of my life, and she happens to be laying in our bed upstairs waiting for me while watching some terrible Hallmark Christmas movie. And frankly, I hope and expect to be sharing that bed with her for the next fifty to sixty years while groaning and suffering over having to watch Hallmark movies with her.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1126168,public,self,"Biggest Surprise of My Life When It Came to Women, and I Think Will Help Some Guys Starting Out Who Are Looking for a Way to Support a Life-Long Relationship/Marriage",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qtiwoc/biggest_surprise_of_my_life_when_it_came_to_women/,no_ads,0.0,,,,

It's only after digging through a pile of these people (wanting to commit violence to a stranger without a bond of trust and love) that you find people who want to date (but they're often mega awkward) or actually cool and sweet people who want to hang out together, go on a date, have a sweet, romantic one-night-stand and do it again a week or so later, again with candle light dinner, or a movie, or sitting on top of a mountain as the sun sinks away and you watch the lights of the city go on.

What I seriously don't understand is how the BDSM crowd that terrorizes these apps can be so socially oblivious to the fact that to do BDSM it must be build upon trust and love. Why would anyone let a stranger tie them up during a one-night-stand?! That's literally the easiest route towards getting raped and/or murdered. Obviously my personal rape trauma is speaking here (5 years ago I was raped by 3 men who tried to murder me, and this didn't even happen during a date, it happened as I was walking to the super market in clear daylight), which has caused me to stop dating men, so now I date only women (and people inbetween who lean closer to the feminine side.)

What I'm trying to ask is: ""These days I actually feel kinda lonely. It often feels like I'm one of the last people left on the planet who doesn't have violent sexual fantasies, as if I'm one of the last people who actually wants sweet romantic caring love (even if it's only a one-night-stand). Why are there so few sweet romantic people left. Or am I the weird one, that doesn't like BDSM because of my rape trauma?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1126170,public,self,"Dating apps, their BDSM crowd and how rape victims deal with it",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qtji9l/dating_apps_their_bdsm_crowd_and_how_rape_victims/,no_ads,0.0,,,,

I never thought I was unattractive but I’m short 5”7 and have a slight lazy eye which I hate. 
Last night me and a bunch of friends were out for a friends bachelor party and at the end of the night we went to a private karaoke bar where the place offers girls to come sing and dance with you. We had 4 girls for the night between about 20 guys. I’m usually shy when it comes to dancing and singing but I really put in an effort to take but and I did. All the other guys are in relationships or married so I was the only single guy there. All the girls either danced and were talking to everyone but me even when I was standing in the with another friend and 3 girls I got no attention whatsoever. At one point I was next to a friend who was with a girl who was super interested in him and throughout the night she was getting really close to him grinding on him getting super close to his face like she was going to kiss him etc and he turned to me and said something like “she’s so hot and won’t leave me along” i then said yeah nice for you she has barely looked at me all night.10 seconds later he whispers something in her ear presumably something along the lines pay me attention because she immediately lost the smile on her face looked down then Walked towards me and my friend tried to move me closer to her and said “she wants to get closer to you” I resisted and said to him I don’t want you to have to say anything and get attention out of pity. Then for the next 2 hours she was sitting next to him jumping on top of him and went and got his Instagram etc. that was the main thing I took out of it because I was obviously attracted to her the most but the other 3 girls didn’t pay me attention either and was spending time with the other friend did mine. Now I know I’m not entitled to a females attention/ flirting but if I don’t get it where it’s their job to do it this made me realise we’ll I’m just ugly and not getting tinder matches / general flirting and interest from girls isn’t a coincidence.

The thing is: i've realized i have a crush on his now ex-boyfriend and he is at the same school i am. I've seen him a couple of times around and damn, he is even more cute in real life than in cheesy tiktoks.

I'm not even kidding, the perfect height, perfect features, looks like the personalization of your average wattpad story.

So, basically this post is to ask for some opinions or even advice. I really want to meet this boy and see how things go. I'm not an insecure guy but the world of gay dating is very weird, he is really handsome and well, i'm not that popular or famous for my good looks.

firstly i will give you a brief overview of me, i am 34, 6ft earn over 65k a year, have a good physique and have no issues meeting people and getting dates, i grew up in an abusive family but i have worked on it, and am highly independent with a few close friends,   
i will say i do struggle to let people get close to me, this is a coping mechanism of mine as everyone who has gotten close to me, eventually has ended up hurting me. 

now her, she is sweet, affectionate and always wants to be around me, this isn't always a bad thing but i am kinda feeling smothered, i have mentioned this to her,  she has expressed that she will look to stop this, but i am seeing further red flags. she is 30 years old earns less than 20k and is overweight.  
she told me on the second date that she loves me so much and already knew i was the one.   
she has 2 children who she has already introduced me to, and they are good kids but i am now unsure if i am ready to be around children or ever want them.   
she wants more children, i have told her that i do not want them, this made her upset and says she will get over this, i feel bad for this.  
she has asked me to move in with her, and create a family home with her.   
her ex-partner does not like me and threw a tantrum when he saw me sat on the couch.  


we were in bed yesterday and just talking, she was talking about how she used to suffer from anorexia, attempted suicide and a list of other mental disorders,   i heard a few things that i didn't like, so went slightly quiet, she asked me what i was thinking so i told her that listening to her, i am curious to whether or not she see's sex as a validation mechanism(she has a high sex drive) and whether she had ever been abused, she was a bit taken back on this so started sulking, i asked that if she had ever wanted to talk about it, her response was she didn't see value in counselling and just wanted to keep taking the pills, i must note i never knew she was on medication. i also must say that i keep seeing a pattern of poor mental health decisions,

I want to add, no deep feelings are invested, impossible to considering it was only one date. He was really such a gentleman and very sweet. And I was very interested in getting know him!

Most times when we see each other we have sex, now he wants to have serious training (he’s been going to the gym for a couple years and is fit but missed a couple days and is getting ready for a professional fight next year). 
This morning we had sex and I blew him, so he came twice, but I didn’t cum so I wanted to have sex again. He then proceeded to call me a nympho in a joking kind of way, and then said he knows how much I want it inside blah blah blah. I didn’t like this and he kept calling my his “nimphy”. He makes it sound as if sex is a one person act, like he doesn’t want it as much as I do. But when I said I didn’t like that, he said it’s nothing to be ashamed of and he likes that about me. I told him I know it’s fine, I’m not ashamed, I just like sex. After that, we did fuck again, and I said I don’t know if I can come see him in the middle of the week because I prefer going to work from my house, to which he said okay I guess we’ll see eachother next weekend(that upset me). I asked if he even wants to see me in the middle of the week and he responded yes but it’s not good we keep fucking, I want to save my energy for training. 
We have met and slept together without having done anything sexual before so I got upset and told him that. He said yes but one of us is gonna do something and we’re gonna end up fucking. I don’t know if I should see him in the middle of the week or no if he’s saying things like that as if I can’t control myself. Any thoughts opinions or advice, much appreciated.

It was love at first sight for me, like a love film on the TV. Unfortunately, I cannot put into words what it is, but it was something I have never felt before.   
The first meeting was when we formed a group for our term paper, which I am now doing with her and 2 colleagues.  During the week I gathered all my courage and asked her if she would go out to eat with me, which she agreed without hesitation.  
 So we went to eat. We had a good chat and she told me that she has a boyfriend. It sucked for me, but I accepted it, or at least I thought so.  She is a relatively closed person and has problems with new people, except with me she was very open right away. (Which she also told me weeks later that she was never as familiar with anyone as with me)  
We met a lot for coffee, food and study. She was always very open but never mentioned her boyfriend unless I spoke to her about it. There were always difficult situations to stretch, I thought it was going badly between the two of them. Just like when it came down to her wanting to move; I asked if she was moving in with her boyfriend. It followed silently with a stuttering answer, no currently she can't live with him because she doesn't want to.    
Over the weeks we built a very strong emotional bond and she confided in me a lot, including things that she didn't even tell her boyfriend and still told me.  All the while I was wondering; Don't she feel that we are a great match and that it could actually be more.  Last Friday we studied together and had a great day. When I said goodbye, I had this feeling that it would be right to kiss her, but I didn't ...  
But this gave me the trigger to talk to her about what is going on between us. So I wrote to her on Saturday evening whether she would come for a drink on Monday, I would like to discuss something with her:  The time had come last Monday and we met in the campus bar to talk, she was a little different all day and I had the feeling that she knew what it was about.  
We sat down and I spoke to her openly that I value our friendship very much, but I have actually recovered that we could be more than just friends and I know that this is not possible at the moment. I told her how stressful this situation had been for me over the past few weeks.   


She said: I thought it was about that and she's been through the same things over the last few weeks as I just described to her.  
Everything is ok at school, but as soon as you get on the train, your thoughts start to spin and you know that it just fits between us. The conversation lasted 3 hours and we both had a hard time and cried too. She told me she had been thinking about what she really wanted for the last few days and she had decided on her boyfriend.   
I know her facial expressions and body language very well and immediately realized that she wasn't serious. I told her that too, whereupon she confirmed that it was not true. Nevertheless, she was honest again afterward and said she has been with her boyfriend for a year now and she does not want to give up what she has built and she is also not unhappy with him.   
She knows that these feelings between us are special because she has never had such feelings, but this does not mean that our relationship would work.  Yes, we talked for a long time and she also told me that it was love at first sight with her and that she immediately mentioned that she had a boyfriend while eating.  She also said she wished she hadn't met her boyfriend because if it weren't so difficult between us and that she would surely be with me if time would have played differently.    


When asked why she never said anything about her boyfriend, the answer came: She saw that it would hurt me and she didn't want to hurt me and it felt wrong too.  One more mention was that she thinks of her boyfriend when she is with me, but not of me when she is with her boyfriend, whatever this statement means or how serious it really was, I don't know. (I mean I also think of her boyfriend when we are together) She also spoke about the situation from last Friday and confirmed that it would have felt right there to kiss me. So she just turned around and left.  I told her I was hoping for clarification from this conversation, but the only thing that has changed is that I now have even more hopes.  
She said I shouldn't get my hopes up. She can't watch it when I feel bad. Then I said out of reflex what I thought: I'll keep my hopes up until you tell me what is going on or someone puts a ring on your finger.  I know this statement was maybe not entirely ok, but it is the confusion and she would know that without me telling her.   
I asked her if she had spoken to her boyfriend about that she had feelings for me.  She said no. I told her he deserved to know what she was going through, which she said she wanted to talk to him, but she needs time. I also gave her a tip to talk to someone else about it. Whereupon she said she would talk to her sister and mother about it.  
That was the ""short version"" of the conversation. We are left with nothing, but actually, I expect her to come up to me (in the near future) and tell me what's going on, or am I wrong?  
I just don't know what to do now.  


Should I give her 4 weeks and if she hasn't said anything by then, do I speak up?  
We decided to study together the morning after the conversation, the atmosphere was a bit strange for an hour, but we've been more or less back to the old pattern since then.  I would be very happy for a tip on how best to deal with the situation.
