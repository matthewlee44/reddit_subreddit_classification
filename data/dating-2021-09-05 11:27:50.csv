0,pig7hp,1630859299,How to meet girls outside of school?,"30 yo Canadian here. I've had zero success with girls since March 2020. Not even a date! The pandemic of course makes it harder but it's not an excuse. I do have somewhat high standards that I've lowered recently, but I will not pursue a girl I'm not attracted to just to break the dry spell. Here's what I've tried:

Online dating - tried for years, doesn't work for me and I will not invest another minute into it (being 5'8 doesn't help)

MeetUp app - great for making friends, AWFUL for dating; mostly an older crowd and even age restricted groups in my area are sausage fests  with very few opportunities to meet NEW girls (likely cause any time there's a new cute girl she gets too much male attention and doesn't come back)

Restaurant server job - it's not easy relating to girls who are nearly a decade younger than me, and it's only gonna get worse as I get older, but I'm probably just doing something wrong or being insecure about my age; men get more attractive in their 30s from what I've heard and there's plenty of older guys dating girls in their early to mid 20s

Pick-up volleyball - mostly an older crowd and definitely a sausage fest

Gym - SO MANY attractive girls, but I find it hard to break the ice and most are listening to music/don't want to be approached

Reading books on this topic - I've read books such as Models by Mark Manson, 3% Man by Coach Corey Wayne and Mystery Method Venusian Arts Handbook  (some multiple times), but I find that all that knowledge is useless without application and where I'm struggling now is finding opportunities for application

\--------------------

I'm not gonna go out of my way to do something I don't enjoy like knitting just to meet women. So here's what I PLAN to do:

Salsa nights - LOTS of women, partner dancing breaks the ice for you and allows opportunities for conversation; but there's not a lot of venues offering this around here and that could diminish further because of the 4th wave and winter is coming (fuck Canadian weather)

Karaoke nights - unfortunately mostly an older crowd, but still a good number of younger women; it feels much more acceptable to go up and talk to a random table here than a regular bar (or not so random if they cheered you or you cheered them)

Learn pick up - it's not that younger attractive women don't exist, I just don't seem to have opportunities to talk to them; they are literally everywhere except my social circles so clearly I need to rely less on my social circles, just man up and talk to strangers

Cut down on porn - once a day is way too much and definitely affects my sex drive and motivation; I've tried nofap in the past but never got further than 60 days and usually can't get past a few days

Move (maybe) - being a restaurant server, quitting and finding a new job  shouldn't be too difficult which gives me the flexibility to travel or  relocate especially with the money I've saved; but I currently live at  home since March 2020, and can't realistically afford to live in places  like Toronto or Vancouver; in Canada, there aren't many options in terms  of affordable big cities as opposed to the US (I wouldn't qualify for a work visa); it may even benefit me to stay in the Greater Toronto Area rent free for the near future as opposed to moving to say Calgary where it could be worse

What are your thoughts? Is there anything I could change about what I'm currently doing or are there any flaws in what I plan to do?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pig7hp/how_to_meet_girls_outside_of_school/

15,pih01r,1630861857,I requested we take things slow; Did I push him away? ( 30 M) ( 24F),"Hello everyone so I would appreciate some insight into this;

In July, I met this man on tinder; we chatted for a bit, and then I deleted my Tinder profile only to join back in August, and we then matched again.

The second week of August, we meet up for brunch, and we click, and the conversation is easy flowing, and then he drops me home following the end of our meeting, and we plan our next rendezvous.

The second/Third/Fourth meeting is at this apartment as he works until 7 pm, so he picks me up after work, and we usually go to his home and watch a movie/eat/play a board game or talk for a few hours.

With that been said, our second meeting escalated as we began making out and fondling, which I did not expect, so I did tell him to slow down a bit as we were moving way too fast.

He then asks me what I want out of this; I then tell him that I want a relationship, and he tells me he wants a companion that he hopes will lead into a relationship and that he likes me and was shocked at how well we clicked from the very beginning.

Anyhow, we do try to hang out at least twice a week depending on our schedule, so on Friday, we met up, and he created a wine and charcuterie board for me that we had spoken off. It was lovely, so brought a fun conversation card game called convo and chill, and we talked/drank and ate.

The conversation was intense as the questions on the card were about marriage/love/gender roles and so forth.

We had disagreements on gender roles, which worried me a bit, but I was glad we had those conversations.

However, now im worried as I did tell him that I like to take things slow and build a strong foundation/friendship that leads to something romantic.

He felt as if I should trust that he has good intentions and that regardless of the time factor, his intentions are pure and that he likes me.

Anyhow, we had a short conversation in his car/kissed/hug and said goodnight, and he then texted me when he got home.

We then chatted a bit on Saturday about his job and so forth ,and then I did not hear from him. 

Anyhow now Im scared that I have messed this up by showcasing my insecurity/distrust etc.

He texts me every day in the early morning so I haven't heard from him today so I'm unsure if he has lost interest or if I should text him or what is happening. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, I would appreciate some advice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pih01r/i_requested_we_take_things_slow_did_i_push_him/

19,pih7mh,1630862546,"Is wanting to date a woman with a healthy body composition an ""unrealistic standard"" for a normal man?","According to medical publications, a man with higher than 17% body fat and a woman with higher than 32% body fat are both classified as ""overfat"" which is a condition of high enough body fat to no longer be healthy. I think health and fitness are important. I work out every day (biking, swimming, weights, or body weight) for 30-40 minutes. I practice intermittent fasting and try to eat mostly healthy foods. My body fat is around 14% and going down slowly over time. 

I would like to date someone similar to me who also maintains a healthy body composition. I asked about this yesterday in another forum, and the answers I got all essentially said that it is unrealistic for a normal man to expect to date someone similar to him in this regard. 

The answers said that a woman with a healthy body composition has so many options she will demand the man be tall, or white, or beautiful, or look like he's on steroids. I am none of those things.

Thus I was told I should not expect to date anyone similar to me. Parallel to that, someone in another thread suggested I also increase my exercise to 10 hours per week (1-2 hours per day) as I'm not getting exactly the endurance and strength I want from my current routine. I'm considering it but I also fear that this will just disconnect me from the women I am able to date further. 

If I am working out 10 hours a week, I am concerned the prospect of meeting someone compatible likely goes down not up. Since I'm still not going to be using steroids, I still won't reach the movie star physique threshold. Thus I won't get the benefit of standing out against the steroid users on apps. At the same time, my lifestyle will become even more abnormal compared to the average sedentary person.

What do you think? Is wanting to date a woman who similarly maintains a healthy body composition with a lifestyle like mine an unrealistic lifestyle standard? Do you think going up to 10 hours of exercise per week might make it better or worse?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pih7mh/is_wanting_to_date_a_woman_with_a_healthy_body/
20,pihafr,1630862794,How to hack the dating Matrix for Guys. =Unlimited girls.,"You can be short, bald, pathetic.  But if you know how to hack the dating Matrix you can get girls. 

Answer:  Be the Chief.

Our brains are wired for small groups.  The Chief is the leader of that group.  The girls will play favour for the Chiefs attention and protection.  If you pissed off the Chief in ancient times, you could be excommunicated from the group and perish quite easily.  Thus the Chief would have almost full access to the women of the group.  He could have a harem if he chose.

A real life example:  I know a medium average brown guy.  He was a bartender at a club.  He slept with 20-30 women a month.  Why?  Because he was the Chief of that small club.  100's of girls talked to him during the night.  And they would compete for his attention.  Thus unlimited girls.

23,pihomm,1630864081,Should I ask my personal trainer out for a date?,"Tl;dr I'm attracted to my personal trainer at the gym. Don't know and can't tell if he is into me. Too shy to initiate anything. Feeling miserable. 

So, Ive (26f) been depressed for +2years. Haven't dated anyone since 2019. I mostly work from home and have to take care of my elderly grandparents. Don't really have an active social life.

After lot of thought, I've joined gym in late-July. Due to pandemic the gym is mostly empty. I am the only girl who is regular and maybe 1-2 teenagers work out on alternate days. 
Staff: a trainer and his assistant. And just the manager who also manages adjacent spa and saloon. 

In August, I decided I need to lose weight and tone up to get back in dating scene. That's when I ve asked the trainer (25M) if he is open to train me.
He wears a mask all the time, as per the protocol. But when he removed it, I was instantly attracted to him. He is in great shape and hot af. 

Now I've been training under him for over a month. Every day I look forward to see him at the gym. Every day i feel butterflies in my stomach. 

what I've noticed is he is very professional. And takes his job seriously. He doesn't like when I joke around during workouts or try to talk too much. And would like me to rather focus on what he instructs me. 

I see him for 1-2 hours everyday. I don't want to initiate anything and get rejected. it would end up awkward for him (since I'm the only client in that gym for him) and I would lose interest in going to gym and may fall back on my old habits. 

He does small talk: asks me about my diet that day, if I had enough sleep and how is my work going on. Thats about it. Very few times he asked about personal details. 

Since he wears mask all time during workout, I can't figure out or read him. (I'm allowed to not wear a mask).

I have his number and update him about my diet. He gives me a one world reply or a thumbs up emoji (annoying af). The conversation goes nowhere. 

Right now I'm not looking to have any serious relationship. I have to work on my emotional issues (as per my therapist). I'm confused and miserable, what can I do now?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pihomm/should_i_ask_my_personal_trainer_out_for_a_date/

34,pij43l,1630868683,What the hell is wrong with people?,"I'm a guy so I can only speak to women only but god damn I am about to die of some serious illness trying to just get a date or build a connection with someone. I am mid 30, have a house, about top 1% income in the US, no kids, never married, etc... here is a list of my recent attempts to get a date:

23 year old meets me at a bar after 1 year of on and off texting. Randomly we meet she is 1.45 hours late... I had ironically left to my car to leave the bar when she pulls up. I calm down, and offer her a drink. We go back to the place and she is all handsy, lovey, close affectionate to me and really interested. She text me the next morning and haven't heard from her since. - BTW when we were out some dudes were spam calling her # like 10 times in a row....

I'll skip the insanely stupid OLD stuff and get to the people I met or video chatted with: 

24 year old that was talking about a future, we are long term compatible, etc. Date ended sorta abruplty, after I took her to breakfast and bought her a plant since she likes them. 4 weeks later after not hearing from her or anything I text her and she says she is in a serious relationship with someone else. She def knew this person while she went out with me and kissed me in my car. COol bro.

21 year old that text me she is coming back (we hooked up before many times) from another city and wants to see me again. When she is supposed to be back I text her ""what's up are you back ok?"" and she said ""I'm in a relationship with someone seriously"" sorry. 

24 year old tells me ""we are too different"" after we saw each other 3 weeks. She was willing to still come over and hook up even though dating someone else. She told me he was really controlling so she broke it off. OK dude.

19 year old talks to me for 3 weeks then randomly unadds me on snap, no explination. we sent many videos and texts she was coming here for school

20 year old talks to me on video call for 2 hours, talks about a future, etc, setting up future meets, asap... text her 2 times after our call and haven't heard from her agian.

26 year old ""doesn't drive"" &amp; ""doesn't talk on the phone"" - we arranged to just meet and chat. I got her an americano with cream for her morning as she asked me to. Then when I get to her place I called her and she blocked me. We chatted on the phone and yes can confirm she said ""yes,"" ""no"" ""yes"" type short answers to my open ended questions.

26 year old was going to meet up with me Friday said ""see you tomorrow"" on Thur and never herad from her Friday. 

Say what you want about age - I know it is mostly younger, but in my area if you are around 30 and female you are usually either 1) horribly out of shape or 2) children/baby momma drama. Sorry no thanks. I mean what is even the point of this? Hardly ever is this about me... But what are the chances of finding a good partner that you are attracted to? seems mostly random imo.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pij43l/what_the_hell_is_wrong_with_people/

42,pikb1z,1630872510,Worried if I was gross or made her uncomfortable when we made out on our second date,"So basically I've been on 2 dates with this girl, on the first one we just drove around town, talking and getting to know each other more

On our second date we went to play pool and drink. When we were done we went to my place to cuddle and make out. She didn't show any signs of discomfort and I made sure to ask if it was ok to touch breast when making out (she said yes). She said she wanted to have sex but wasn't sure if it was the right move since it was just our second date, so we didn't end up having sex but we kept cuddling and making out. Plus she also had to go to work early in the morning. So she left around midnight and we made out one last time before she left.

The next day we didn't meet up because she was working and was tired. I asked if she needed a ride home after work, but she replied with ""I drove here but thanks anyway 🥰🥰"" I was already feeling kinda anxious if I did something wrong but that reply made me think that we were good.

So the next day I asked if she wanted to meet again sometime later within the next few days... but then she said ""I have to tell you something..."" 

So I said ""okay"" and was starting to worry if it had anything to do with our second date. So being the anxious dumbass that I am I sent her ""sorry if I made you uncomfortable last friday"" it took her around 40 minutes to open the message and reply. She said ""its ok... I dno"" I thought for sure she didn't want to keep seeing each other and I don't know what it is she wanted to tell me. So I asked if she wanted to stop going out with me? I realized my mistake and sent another message couple of minutes later ""sorry that I asked so quickly, take your time"" and she left me on read, I saw her ig story and she's out with a friend rn.

I'm such a idiot, I don't know if that was what she wanted to talk about but now I wonder if I was to touchy or something last friday and I don't know what to do.

47,pil8fd,1630875523,Why assume?!,"I’ve been talking to a guy from a dating app for about a month. We got on so well, he was respectful and had so much in common.

We could meet right away because I had covid and then got busy with returning to work. After about about a month of talking, he asked for some more pictures of me. I thought it was strange because we both send each other selfies randomly.

He asked if I had ones of “all of me”. I told him I don’t have any because I genuinely don’t take body pictures. I’ve been approached for modelling in public more than once and I always decline because I find the whole someone else taking you picture thing awkward. What do
You do with your hands and arms. 

He started acting strange after that and I left him alone. I’m not going to chase someone who doesn’t want to talk to me.

Today he noticed me in public and came up to me. He seemed so happy to see me and talk to me. He asked why I don’t take body pictures, I told him I find the whole thing awkward and he said he gets it. He then went onto saying, I’m just surprised you have such a nice body. So I asked him why he was so distant and he said he doesn’t like big girls.

I was so turned off at that point. I understand people have preferences but imo that’s a really horrible thing to do. Had I have been bigger he would have treated me just as disposable.

Me m 25 talking to an old classmate f 25.

Hadn't really interacted with her outside of school stuff except I went to her house 1 time to ""talk"" nothing happened except for a lot of talking.

Fast forward 9 years later.

I was cleaning out some old HDD and usbsticks and came across all the photos that had been taken during schooltrips and found a couple of just me and her.
The feelings came back immediately. I decided to send them to her.
We began talking about the pictures and how I still had them.

I knew immediately that I would want to meet her again in real life. So I asked her if she would want to grab a drink with me.

She read the text a couple of hour's ago and hasn't responded. But I've seen that she been online a couple of times.

We went out on friday and it was fun. Ended up having a great night together. Then again this week we have been texting constantly and she wants to come over during the week for dinner at my apartment and a movie.

This is something I would be completely open to with her except I work pretty late hours during the week. By this I mean a few days out of the week I am working on data projects for a friend of a professor and would not be able to give her my complete attention until they are completed. 

So the weekends are the only times I really have enough free time to plan something out. I am completely interested in having her over once I complete my work for the day. 

It would be late is all, we wouldn't be able to hang out until 10 to 10:30 at night most likely. Then I would have to be up early the next day anyways so we would really only get a few hours to spend time together.

Today, I am writing this because I am starting to give up on the idea of finding the one or being in love. Let me start, properly. 

I haven't been in a relationship in a long time, mostly because of past experiences/relationship and certain events plus I didn't felt that I was quite ready to be in one, and didn't wanted to make someone else suffer because of it, I avoided coming in one.

But now, when I am finally feel ready and want to be in one, I have been having nothing but awful experiences like I tried everything but something will just happen that will make it all go away, or will just act as a barrier/wall and I will be left alone questioning everything. 

Like, I want to be in love, like having that one person that I can talk to everyday, that I can take care of, be with her, go on dates and long drives with her, can have late night conversations with her on about anything. Like having someone I can finally turn to when I feel low, like having someone who just wants to be with me, and actually feels happy and filled with joy after seeing me, both of us will encourage each other to do our best and be there for each other when we need us the most. I know, that when I will find her, I will take care her of her, and love her a lot but I don't think that I am meant to be loved or that I can be in a relationship, like its not just not meant for me. Like, it's not made for me. I might be a little over dramatic here, but the thing is I have tried everything now, I mean people who don't even value their girls or their partners are still in relationship. Did anybody else went through something like that, or is it just me?

74,pimupi,1630881101,Fuck Double Standards.,"If you go on Tinder, hinge or any dating site. A lot of females be acting on some other shit. They are probably the same ones that have “BLM” and “Body Positivity” on their Instagram profiles and stories 24/7. Yet, they continue to demean other men and women on dating platforms. They act racist to minorities that are Asian / Brown without viewing them as a individual person. I don’t care what soft shit you tell yourself but that ain’t just preference at that point. It’s called pure racism. 

Don’t get me wrong, I understand these are apps that are meant for mostly “very attractive” people. But it really sucks that a lot of people act like this these days. It really demeans the racial equality and body positivity movements in every sense.

76,pimzkk,1630881583,How come nerdy girls always seem to be emotionally unavailable?,"So, I've just been wondering, How come it always seems like they're never interested in dating someone. All the girls I've asked out so far, have never been remotely interested in dating, or guys, or anything like that in general. For one or two girls, sure maybe its just freak luck, but there's just no way I could have ran into girls like that each and everytime. I have to wonder if its a legit thing.

They always seem to either be obsessed with some kpop idol, or anime husbando, but the idea of actually dating someone is just not even on their radar. I get it, I have a few waifus of my own, but even I found myself wanting to be with someone whom I connect with and then wanting to further that connection to see if it's something worth pursuing. Only time I ever met someone who seemed like they were actually interested in me (and dating in general) we pretty much had nothing in common. I just couldn't find anyway to connect with them so I'm kinda just sitting there waiting for our little hang out session to end.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pimzkk/how_come_nerdy_girls_always_seem_to_be/
77,pin5ys,1630882235,Would you stay with the perfect guy if he used drugs regularly?,"Talking about drugs like weed and psychedelics. I love him and he’s so sweet, caring, loving, and he understands me on a level that nobody else ever could. He has dreams and ambitions, works hard, and loves to spend his time with me, never gets mad or abusive or loud or passive aggressive or _anything_. 

Then there’s the drug use. He smokes weed almost every day and on weekends he sometimes throws in MDMA, LSD or mushrooms. Most of the time I don’t even notice if he wouldn’t tell me, which is a bit scary. 

The drug use doesn’t affect our relationship at all, but I don’t know if I can see a future with this behaviour because at the end of the day, it’s irresponsible and self destroying. I myself only drink alcohol in moderation and don’t take any other drugs.

When we started dating it was awesome and she was adventurous, inquisitive, open to new experiences and optimistic. The past 2 years tho she is always ""sick"" (headache, cramps, nauseus,) with something that winds up me having to cancel plans with friends and also cancel trips that I planned for us (the last time was our anniversary get away that I planned and paid for). She isn't interested in doing anything unless one of her friends calls then she is out the door. I cook and clean and take care of the pets all for her to just sit on the couch. The main thing is she is never there when I need her emotionally and when I tell her about what I am dealing with, the conversation turns quickly into what she is dealing with and we sort her stuff out. I am not here to complain but to put it lightly this is a one way relationship. Everytime I tell her I am leaving something drastic always happens. Someone dies or her parents are getting divorced or she goes to the emergency room and I feel terrible and stick around a few more weeks and just have an open convo about what I need to change for me to stay. Always promises to change.... Never does and we have the same fights all the time. At this point I don't even say anything I just do the extra whatever that she doesn't do to avoid her loud exhale and complining. Then I read on here how terrible dating is these days and I'm just thinking... I know I don't deserve this crap but is it better than trying to meet someone new.

80,pingx3,1630883357,Should I Sleep With Him?,"Here's the deal:

My guy roommate is SO handsome and such a gentleman. He moved in a few months ago and I thought I heard a girl over a few times, but he said they were ""JUST FRIENDS"".

The past month he started asking me to hang out, buying me drinks, dinner, holding the door, telling me I was pretty, etc. He's never taken me in his car though, just to local bars within walking distance (2 minutes). 

We've spent a couple nights cuddling and he tried to have sex with me. We almost did but at the last minute I decided not to let him go in. 

Now we haven't hung out in 2 weeks and this weekend I heard the SAME girl that he said was ""just his friend"" over again, he took her out in his truck for dinner, and she spent the night in his room and I could awkwardly hear them having sex. 

I also checked Facebook and she appears to know his family and is in lots of photos of him posing at the beach. Regardless I asked him like 4 times and he still claims he doesn't have a girlfriend.

I have to live with him everyday and it's painful for him to have ignored me for the two weeks.

Will sleeping with him (actually doing it and not just cuddling) make him want me? It broke my heart to hear him with that other girl last night as I thought he liked me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pingx3/should_i_sleep_with_him/

I spent Saturday and all of today cramming my homework so I could enjoy their company and a few drinks in peace. Come to find out they aren’t coming over because my sister decided to have a sleepover with her boyfriend instead and didn’t tell me until a few hours before said plans were to go down.

Everyone close to me is in a relationship, it’s not my intention to sound bitter but I really miss their company. I’ve been single for three years and even when I was in a relationship I still valued my friendships. We’re young (early 20s) and childless, sometimes I wish my friends would recognize that we have the rest of our lives to spend time with boyfriends etc. My best friend and I used to see each other on a weekly basis, now we see each-other maybe twice a month. I’m not desperate to be in a relationship (not that I’m talking to anyone anyways) but situations like this make me acutely aware of how single I am.
