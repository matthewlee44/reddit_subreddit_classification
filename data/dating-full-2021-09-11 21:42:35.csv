Hey, I’m 19m and I’m going on a date for the first time in a while. Her(19f) and I met on a dating site over a week ago and planned a date for this Monday a few days ago. When we first met on the app, conversation flowed pretty easily for a bit, but it’s slowed down a lot due to us both working full time. 

I’m just looking for advice to keep things fun. I feel like I’ve lost a lot of my game over the last few months and I really don’t want to fuck this up. So I was just wondering if anyone had any tips to keep conversation going and to avoid those awkward moments from happening, and some advice on when to know to make a move.

**The date**: HE asked me out to this cute little place. I arrived and he greeted me really nicely with compliments. We ordered. Ate (but my dumbass ordered something really small because i didn't read the menu right, he felt bad and gave me some of his food lol) Then we stayed for hours just talking and laughing, he was making me laugh so much that I even snorted a few times!

Anyways i was having such a great time that I didn't even notice it was going to 11, we got there at 7! Time just flew by, and I could have stayed longer. 

**The Conclusion**: I definitely want to go on another date with him but I'm not going to put all my eggs in one basket. He's really cute, charming, nice,a gentleman, great personality, good job, etc. Which probably makes him a hot commodity with alot of options, I have alot of options to but I'm fairly picky lol.

So I was at an event the other day and there was this one girl who I met briefly. Later throughout the night I was bored so I went over the where she was and she was sitting at a table with the group. 

Now, there was this one other guy, I’ll call John to make things easier, was talking to her quite a bit before and they were sitting next to each other at the table. 

Went to the table grabbed a chair and said “you guys mind if I join you” and she said “no not at all.” She scooted over and I then unconsciously sat right in between her and john. If I remember john didn’t seem super pleased but he also scooted over I think. Pretty much we sat and talked and had fun conversations and teased each other a bit. 

In my eyes john clearly was into her but I didn’t try to “cockblock” him on purpose. How I know he was into him? he got up and went to talk to her as soon as I was leaving.

So story is : I have 3 dates with a guy. I am F36, he is 33 We met online. 1st &amp; 2nd were outdoor, the 3rd one was at his place. He asked me if I wanted to come over after my work. I said ""for what""? and He said "" to hang out"". 

I came over, we talked, watched movies. It was just feeling so right and comfortable.When we were off to bed, he asked if I wanted to stay, I said I do, but I asked where I was gonna sleep. I said "" I am gonna sleep with you on the same bed? I trust you, but I dont trust myself?!!! ""he laughed. Then he kissed me a good night sleep and that s it. LOL . Guys, dont get me wrong, I like him, but I am being cautious too. I dont want to get attached too quick and get hurt (been hurt so much in the past) 

The day after, he drove me to school (trying to do my Ms), we kissed goodbye, it felt so good again. I told him, that I feel comfortable with him. It was friday, then we did not set any specific time for next hang out. Saturday afternoon, I texted him asking how his weekend will be, he said He s tired and want to make sure he sleep well, He said he had plans in the evening, but he was cancelling it, and he said :"" I  will let you know how I feel on Sunday afternoon after my training (he is training fulltime)

 (For more information: the week behind this - the week we met- he told me that he didnt sleep well because his neighbor was so noisy early morning).

Question is : 

1. did i scare him or make a mistake by saying :"" i feel comfortable with him""??? I googled it and many people say When a girl say that it means she wants a serious relationship. OH jezzz, it is not what I meant when I said that. I am a pick woman, and 90% guys will not pass a coffee date with me, Thus, I am enjoying this guy a lot. Should I text him to ' explain' or make it clear to him that it was not what I meant? 
2. Did i make him feel unwanted that I stayed over at his place, but there was no sex? I believe I have the right to make it slow until I feel it s a right moment? How can I do that without shutting down the person?

I decided to actually go to school as a full time student now since I know what degree I want now. I currently live in non-traditional housing with my school. Which means dorms but instead it's a house and I get my own room. 

So this is where things get tricky. I met one of the housemates one night. Lots of stuff in common and he seemed chill. He's pretty awkward but over these last few weeks, he has been getting more comfortable around me. I want to clarify that I don't want to date anyone. He and I have never spoken about dating, feelings, or anything. Ever. It's only being 3 or 4 weeks of even knowing each other and talking a bit in the common area. 

I mention this because I definitely think he has the wrong idea. I never flirt but will have conversations with him and sometimes play the Xbox with him. Everything was super laid back until he started matching my schedule. 

For example, he knows when im home and when im at work. He is always downstairs if im home and never when im not. (Stayed homesick and didn't mention it which is how I found out). I can hear him just playing his Xbox from my room even though he could easily go play in his room. I also mention this because him playing in the common area is a new thing. He uses this as a way of sitting and waiting for me to come down to get food from the kitchen. (Sometimes he will watch movies with the others but usually he just sits in there all alone when I get home and leaves after I get my food) He started showing up at my job and even waits outside to walk me back. I asked him what he was up to, and he said ""oh nothing. Just walking. Is this creepy?"". At the time I said ""No, I saw you in the library so I figured I would see you out here"". (Just wanted to play it off as a one time thing as it was the first time I caught him) He did this once before but I was working late so he eventually left after realizing I wasn't getting off at that time. 

 I also noticed that he is starting to get jealous of my other housemate (let's call him Tim) who I am also pretty chill with. He told me about how weird it is that Tim is close to me or how creepy it is that he talks to me at the gym (my second job). The huge red flag also happened when we were playing halo one night and the 2 housemates (this guy and Tim)  started making a drug deal in front of me. This guy was VERY interested in buying from Tim. (In case you are curious, the drugs were DMT, Acid, Mushrooms, and some other weird names that I didn't understand. Even stuff to make these drugs) 

I'm definitely aware of my mistakes. I had invited him to go to the store with me or to go see stuff on campus as I don't have any friends and he was just sitting in the common area not doing anything. (Why not invite someone to join if they aren't busy either) I'm not flirty and dont even pretend to be into him. We literally just talk. 
So here is where I need help. Obviously this could go one of 2 ways. I am planning to be very clear and straightforward with how I feel. (This is going to happen no matter what) 

but he could A. Be super chill about it and respect that I am slowing becoming uncomfortable with this or B. He could get dangerous.

To be honest, it's not research, I'm just trying to quench my anxiety before it flares up when I pit myself in this situation.

I'm what some people would call a 'youngin' and I have extreme anxiety, so much to the point where I go out of my way to make sure that everything around me is as perfect as possible.

Which brings the question:
How much effort is too much in a relationship?

I know from reading loads, watching loads of videos on why people hate specific types of people, like fetishizing, thinking of an item or award for something, and I strive to keep myself in a condition to where I don't cause any unnecessary stress for any potential partner or date that I my find.

Am I doing too much? Is it best to just wing it?

Thanks for the advice btw!

I’m not looking for marriage material either but even your casual flings don’t have to be based on chasing narcissists or people with the personality of a beige kitchen cabinet.

If you’re even semi-interesting, there are probably loads of strangers out there that you could chat and hang out with for hours. Some people you click with and others you don’t and both are fine. Being honest and straightforward is very liberating and almost intoxicating. If that means you’re not getting laid that night - that’s fine, the sun will rise tomorrow.

I’ve had a girl stop me before I finished my first sentence to tell me that she was out of my league. I’ve been told straight to my face, that I was ugly, laughed at, had girls tell me “ew no”, and in the most painful experience I had a girl post our conversation on her Instagram captioned, “What tf am I doing to get all these ugly boys in my DMs”.

The craziest part of it is that I’m going after girls that are in my league. I’m not going after girls that are pretty or even average looking. I’d rate myself a 3 and I honestly only go after 3s and 2s. I even go after girls that have a reputation for having bad hygiene which used to be a dealbreaker for me.

Might need your interpretation on a few strange behavious.

I am a 32M into a 3 months' relationship with my 31F girlfriend.

I might need your perspective on the following issues she's facing under the sheets, and please consider I am sharing this from a place of trying to understand how best to help and become a better partner myself. 

Lately, she confessed she had many irrational thoughts about me during sex, for example that I might be faking orgasms with her. As a male, this is the first time something like this was ever pulled on me and I wonder if I could do something to help her rather than telling her that I really enjoy doing it with her and I would never fake anything at all. I asked her if I ever gave her the impression I didn't enjoy making love together, but she said that rationally she understands her suspicions are purely irrational and that she sees I really like having sex with her every single time.

Last week, she stopped halfway during sex since she was convinced I was doing one particular position only to make her happy, and not because I enjoyed it, which was not the case at all as I was really liking it myself too!

Last night, making love in the dark, she accused me I was not really enjoying it, and then proceeded to claim that I was losing my erection even. I immediately turned the lights on to show her I was fully erect and that her thoughts were completely irrational to the point she was making stuff up. 

Some of her background: while we had pretty much the same number of partners earlier in our lives, she had a very rough experience with her last ex, when after 6 years together she discovered he lied to her about many, many things, including taking and selling drugs, which devastated her and brought her to a near mental breakdown, from which she mostly recovered. 

Since day1 she told me she has always had difficulties in reaching orgasm, no matter how good her partner was. Also, she told me she would often cry during/after sex.

When we started sleeping together, she told me she really enjoys making love with me, and that she is definitely reaching orgasm much more easily with me than with any other ex she had. 

I often noticed she keeps her eyes closed many of the times we make love, and sometimes indeed cries afterwards or during it, telling me that this is just normal of her, which I found out with some research, it is for some women indeed.

However, often times she really can't get to climax or getting wet even, no matter how hard we try and she gets frustrated at herself when she can't let go, to a stage where she even avoid suggesting me what would help her getting there. In these cases I try to calm her down and do all the things she usually likes, usually with little or no luck. 

Sometimes instead it's all very easy and natural and we get to climax pretty easily with no apparent difference in what I do. She keeps telling me she thinks I am very good in bed, and that it’s her not being able to let go.

I am a bit worried these issues might not be easy to fix by ourselves, and that she/we might seek professional therapy.

Overall, I think both men and women long to be in a loving relationship and desire to be in love with someone, yet at times feel hopeless that it will ever happen. I have a number of thoughts on this that could cover an entire book, but here are my main thoughts on this:

1 ) The digital world has isolated people from each other more than ever. You would think that a digitally connected world would allow people to connect, but the majority of digital connections are not deep connections. People we consider friends are actually just acquaintances. True friendship in the digital world is lacking.

2)  Human mating is probably closer aligned to Lion mating than people realize. Male lions fight and the most dominate male lion wins all the female lions. The female lions are happy and content mating with the most dominant lion and don't mind sharing. The digital world has allowed women to find the most dominant men and pursue them. Hence, why executives and star athletes have hundreds of women available to have sex at any time, while a large portion of men rarely have sex

3) Men and women are simply more different nowadays than at anytime in the past. Period.

4) I think there is a large percentage of women who don't want to meet men and date. They are happy pursuing their careers, interests, etc. Basically, a lot of women don't mind not having a man. Very few men are not happy being alone. Period.

Context for my statement: I went through a divorce in 2019. The relationship was 12 years.  I am in my late 30's. I make over $100,000 a year and started a master's degree program in Aug 2021. I have numerous hobbies and interests. Yet, I find it almost impossible to meet women and date. I thought ""starting over"" would be easy and then I quickly found out that today's dating environment is an utter nightmare. Best of luck to everybody in today's dating world. I hope love finds you one day.

This is about my friend who is desperate for a girlfriend. We have been friends for over two years now and it’s the same every year. 

I should start this by describing my friend. 

My friend is a male (20) and he is abstinent. When I mean abstinent he does not want to have sex or anything in between. Only kissing and cuddling. We go to college, and he is constantly looking for girls in bars and sororities. Not to stereotype but girls this age do not just want to kiss. And especially not girls at the bars and in sororities. I have suggested going to churches and joining church groups, and I an agnostic have even said I will go with him. He refuses to download any dating apps no matter how hard I try. 

I go to bars with him and some of his friends and he will find a girl and start talking to her and buy her a drink. It usually does not work out in his favor. These girls only want to hookup and not pursue anything serious. I have seen it many times. He talks to these girls for maybe an hour and then after when they don’t respond on messages he gets butthurt. I tell him every time your looking in the wrong places, and that’s how it goes at the bars. It’s nothing serious and you win some you lose some. 

He will dm girls or add random ones on Snapchat and talk to them. He gets dates out of them but they don’t work out. He is not a very smooth person and I guess you could say uptight or ever stubborn. He gets stuck on these girls and gets so sad when they don’t work out. This happens way to often. Recently it was two different girls in 48 hours. I don’t have an issue with helping him trying to flirt. But it’s hard when he doesn’t want to be suggestive or ever listen to what I have to say. He will txt me or call me at least five times a day when he has one of these things going about what to say to a girl. It’s way too much. He worries on how to say how are you. Calls me over this way to many times. Just say How are you omg. We once had a 30 min conversation over how to dm a girl on Instagram. He settled on the exact thing he said at the start of the conversation. 

He has recently moved into a new apartment with three guys. One guy has good dating experience. He also asks him constantly on what he should say. This guy got annoyed by it because he would ask every time he would snap a girl. Same as me. He never takes the advice. 

He constantly tries for me to set him up on a date, but the main issue with my friends is that they are all mainly Democrats. He is not. Their views don’t line up with his and he doesn’t think they will work out. Which is fair, but he’s very picky. I have no issue with dating outside of my political opinions, but he does. He’s very Christian as well which makes this harder. He wants a girl that is a good Christian and who is waiting for marriage, but also has a “bad” side. 

I am getting increasingly angry at this because this is what we mainly talk about and he cannot figure things out on his own. He doesn’t take my suggestions and I have told him all of this. I am very blunt at this point but he doesn’t listen. I like having him as a friend because when we don’t talk about this stuff it’s great, but when we do it’s not great.

Here’s what I don’t understand: when I go on a date I want to make a good first impression, that takes time and effort; hair, makeup; clothing, organizing my day accordingly to accommodate this date. Meanwhile, this dude doesn't even HAVE TO LEAVE HIS CAR? There are a million and two other activities we could do that would have costed little to no money.

Both our families live in the same area though, so we might be able to meet up once we go back home for the holidays. 

I’m confused about a lot of things. I can’t tell if he’s interested in me, but I wonder if it’s normal for us to talk so much so late into the night literally every single day. I think I’m planning to tell him how I feel the next time I see him. The other thing is— I wonder if a distance relationship would work? I know it would be difficult for us not to see each other everyday so I don’t want to hold him back from other relationships he may be able to have in person if I wasn’t in the picture… also, my parents have a very strict no-dating policy so even when I DO go back home, it would be quite difficult to see him. 

I have a lot of doubts but I just don’t know what to do. Should I try to let go of the feelings I have now, or should I give it a shot?

I’ve known a girl, she’s beautiful, intelligent, funny and sweet. At the beginning I didn’t know how to approach to her, till I found this subreddit and see one advice that said to improve and show your best qualities and talents. Is been at least a year that I play piano and I can say that I’m pretty good.

So I started my plan to approach to her, the first thing I did to have her attention was to talk with one of my friends in front of her saying “today my class of piano will be so hard” it works, she was surprised that I played one instrument, she asked me if I was good and I said that I didn’t wanted to flex. I think she liked my confidence. 

So the next step of my plan, was to find which was her favourite song, I asked her and she said that she doesn’t had any preferences, so I asked her favourite artist she said Olivia Rodrigo, but I still need it a song so I asked her which song she preferred of her. She said it to me, it was favourite crime.

So I started to find a way to learn this song for this girl and I found one, but it was an easy version and I thought that she deserved better, I find one tutorial and this one was a difficult one, so I started, I think I put a least 5 hours of my day during three days trying to learn, play and master the song. 

Yesterday I was ready and I texted her that I had something to show her, I called her and explained everything that I’ve done, like why I asked her favourite song and all, she wanted to listen the song and I played it while we were in call, it was the 2 most stressful minutes of my life, I had practised this song a million times but at that precise moment I couldn’t miss a note, or it will be awkward. 

I finished the song and she loved it, and maybe you will think that it’s a good thing and yea it is but she asked me a video! So I decided to make this post for advice like 

-how do I dress (formal, normal chill)?

-it’s a good idea to do an introduction and conclusion talking  or just a video of two minutes playing the song ?

-in which angle do I put the camera?

-do I even have to talk ?

-is there a way to surprise her ?

-do I put rings or accessories in my hand to be better looking? 

-when and where do I send the video ?

I need help.

I'm freaking the fuck out. This is what I've wanted for so long and I'm doubting myself. I've felt worthless and nothing more than good dick for so long I forgot what building an emotional connection feels like. 

My therapist is recommending another therapist that specializes in CBT for this case because while she feels I really should pursue this, I need to break my cycle of self destructive thoughts that manifest into negative actions. 

I guess I'm just ranting at this point because I feel like I'm not deserving of this but I know I should feel like I do. 

Anyone have a similar experience that eventually broke the cycle?

We had first met July 2020 online but not yet in person. Talked on okcupid for a couple weeks, went super well. Got her number and we talked 40+ hours over a period of 6 days. She kept making assumptions about my religious makeup. Was telling me she could see herself falling for me. It was the best. I said the same.. it was so intense. She finally bails because of religion even though I keep trying to tell her I've been a Christian forever. 

Anyhow, I message her every now and then after that. We talked one more time a month later then are ghosts me in the middle of a conversation about jazz. I message her every so often and in Feb 2021 she replies. We meet in person. We start dating. We say I love you. It's the most intense and magical relationship I've had in 42 years of life on the planet. The religious assumptions continue. She can't be with me. Then she can. It's back and forth nonstop and always something she will randomly bring up. I never understand why. We talk of our future. Marriage. Kids. She says I have 12 months to decide to propose or lose out. I'm so much into her. She starts staying over then starts staying over 4 to 5 nights in a row, a couple times working from my place. We never want to part. 

Stuff happens. I don't see her for a week. She shows up one day at my door. It's only been a week but it feels like a year. I hold her. I kiss her face. She is back and forth nonstop. She can't be with someone who isn't religious enough. She simply won't believe me. 

Finally out of the blue, one day she's SO clingy, I miss you, I love you, why am I so attached to you? she asks me. She is smitten. I am too. 2 days later suddenly, ""I'm just done. This isn't for me."" She flees. Haven't talked to her since. Basically. 4 months and I still think about her every day. Every night I go to bed shes on my mind. I'd give anything to see her. To hear her voice. I'm dying inside over it. I want no one else. My heart just wants back the love we had.She won't talk to me at all. It's kinda soul destroying to be honest. It's like she died.

There are two girls that I really like, both equally. Girl 1 and I have a very strong connection. We know each other's deepest darkest secrets, and our personalities match perfectly. We have similar interests, and I think dating her would be a really good idea. The issue is that Girl 1 has an ex that she broke up with a month and a half ago, but she liked me during the relationship. She also tries to manipulate me into falling in love with her, but I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing. The reason I say that is because if someone cares about me enough to manipulate me, that's honestly kind of flattering. 

Girl 2 I admire so darn much. She's the nicest person alive and she doesn't have an ex. She has this nerdy vibe to her that I see in myself every single day. I talk to her every day, and she doesn't try to manipulate me into falling in love with her. She doesn't play as many games as girl 1 does. She goes out of her way to do nice things for me sometimes and I'm very grateful to have her. 

Girl 1 is very popular, and a lot of guys want her. Girl 2 is not as popular, and she doesn't have guys crawling over her. 

I need some serious help, since if I don't pick, I'm likely to lose both, and I know for a fact that I'm going to lose one of them if I do pick.

After exchanging a few messages, he suggested we “hangout” sometime soon. I’m not looking to make new friendships, so I clarified whether or not he was asking me out on a date. He said “yes” so given his response I assumed we were on the same page. Long story short, he suggested we go to WENDYS for our date. When I didn’t reply for a few hours he took his first suggestion back and claimed that it was a “joke.” His second suggestion was an evening drive and once again from my perspective, a drive is not a date. My rationale, on dates, I want to make a good first impression: which involves doing my hair, and makeup; picking an outfit, coordinating my accessories and shoes; organizing my day in order to accommodate these things and the date itself. In my opinion, those activities require minimal to no effort from his end - like he wouldn’t even have to leave his car? It’s not about money but rather the lack of thought and effort behind his suggestions. I want to go on a date with someone who is excited to be there, at least excited enough to put some thought into plans. 

I offered to FT or talk on the phone first as a vibe check beforehand thinking if there was a connection, we could plan an actual date activity.

We met through the same sport - from the beginning he was into coaching me and helping me achieve my goals as he was more experienced. Currently we’re talking long distance so meeting is not possible nor can he take “advantage” of me right now.

This guy is really respectful, good character (not just a nice personality) which is hard to find in guys close to my age. I’ve tried dating up to 26 but I guess they just didn’t click. 

(Also, honestly, it’s relieving to talk about deeper topics like adults without sexual innuendos in every other sentence...)

**I’m just bit worried about his past and the age gap**. He has had some traumatic experiences in the past that I have no experience of - because of those I’m not sure is there something I don’t know or something I should know? That’s holding me back a little. Also he has a 6yo child from previous marriage which seems foreign to me (?)

Also I haven’t dated older men much. I guess there’s the risk of getting easily manipulated although he seems like a good person and has always respected women by his own words.

I’m really attracted to the fact that he’s affluent and affectionate in a good way, and isn’t scared to back his words with actions, like getting me gifts and treating me every now and then. 

I know I’m young but I honestly don’t want to mess around &amp; he ticks a lot of boxes.

1) can provide 
2) seems mature (now)
3) backs up his words with actions
4) treats me well

So, I'm a 19M attending university in the USA, and I'm not getting much attention from girls. This is by no means an uncommon issue with guys my age, but I can't find which piece of the puzzle  I'm missing. 

 To add some context, I attend a top 5 university; I'm a published writer; I've worked at one of the nation's top mortgage banks; I was the editor on a book covering strategy in sales; I've given political speeches to hundreds; and I'm a decently good-looking dude. I posted on r/rateme out of curiosity--now deleted--and I got an average rating of an 8.8 across about 30 responses. 

On top of this, I've got what most people would consider a kind, generous personality. Just in the past two weeks, I helped a woman when her car broke down, helped another person when one of her tires fell off, chased after and found a runaway dog, and pitched an idea for an organization dedicated to teaching inner-city kids about finance to a group of peers. Nobody around me knows about these things because I try to be modest in person.
