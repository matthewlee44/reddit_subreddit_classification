Disclaimer: my bf says that we were not together but asked me to be his girlfriend (again for second time little over 2 weeks ago). He has acted like a bf, told me that he didn’t want anyone else 2 days prior, sent me a bunch of love messages and asked me if we were together and I said yes..... now he’s refusing to acknowledge that and denying it..... 

Here’s my experience- 


There was this girl  he went out with in his past (3 years ago maybe)....  when they were young. He kept her on the bottom  of Snapchat and she decided to chat with him and ask him how he was doing with a “☺️” . He claims she was trying to be nice since it’s been a while since they went on a date. Hey let’s say I doubt she knows about me although he posts about me sometimes (maybe he hid his story from her.) 

You could tell that she wanted a conversation so he saw the chat (slide it) and I had to beg him to either  block or simply unadd as it made me uncomfy they had a past. He didn’t for at least an hour and got tired of me... this made me extremely nervous and I got the gut feeling he had smth for her.
 it took a few hours but he ended up blocking her. 


After that he started thinking about her and he claimed that it was the devil (were Christian) Putting in lustful thoughts. He told me that he was thinking of her kissing him with me in the room (I absolutely got so uncomfortable.) i wanted a 1 man relationship with him only. 


He then started having reoccurring feelings come back and it finally stopped. He then came to me said he had a dream about a girl he wouldn’t tell me who the girl was and he lied. He said that in the dream I cheated so he cheated back as a result. A few weeks down the line he told me that the girl was HER . he said sorry for lying I forgave him. 


He said that he keeps dreaming about her. I checked her Instagram and he kept following her. Sidenote : he never wanted me to know her name he told me last name I found out on my own. I asked him “can you kindly Unfollow because you’ve been following this girl and you’ve been having feelings for her and I don’t want this to disrupt our relationship.” 

He couldn’t I asked him many times and he couldn’t. I saw him in person  and he got uncomfortable when I said it again; the whole time at the park he was talking about his life and her and who she was and what she was doing. We didn’t talk about me once. She was the WHOLE CONVO !! 

He finally unfollowed her and blocked her for me. He told me that he was doing this as a vow for God and that he couldn’t idolize her anymore. He said he would not  do it for me (says sin feels good he would not stop). It kind of makes me wonder if God wasn’t around he would’ve kept her around.  


Days later.... (keep in mind he makes very impulsive decisions and decided to unblock her whenever he’s mad at me) 


She then posted on her story and he ended up unblocking (had a mini fight because he was acting rude). She posted a pic of her and he told me it took every ounce in his body not to screenshot the picture even though he has a gf. 

He says that he could never imagine marrying her or loving her but he had his eye on her. Every time he fights with me he always says that she’s the DEFAULT SETTING  and he always runs back to her whenever we fight. 

Let u in on some backstory he’s broken up with me talked to another girl and FaceTime her and then got back with me because he realized he didn’t want her and she wasn’t right for him (yes borderline cheating even though he keeps making it obvious he wasn’t “mine”) 


Regardless of the other girls in the past that he broke up to talk to  and then got back to me with she’s always on his mind. In a fight that we had when I just told him my feelings but what I thought he claims that I’m a liar ignorant selfish and disruptive. 

He unblocked her and add her back on Snapchat as well. She then send a streak (he does not do streaks )and he sent one back of the ceiling. I said what was your motive to add her back and he said hurt. He could not tell me why. So he runs to the girls when he’s hurt.


 At the end of it he told me he needed another outlet to go to and girls relieved that output. He said that with a personal issue he thought God was leaving him therefore he wanted to get payback at God which I’d never condone.

After all this he’s basically running to woman every time he gets in a fight with me always trying to run away from me and when I confronted him and said they are always talking to other people he admitted to it and actually said sorry but I’m not ready to take that.

(Quick formatting disclaimer: any name with quote marks around them is a fake name to maintain anonymity.)

Strap in folks, this is a bit of a long one. So, I’m a theater kid and two of my closest friends, (both 18) are dating. The boyfriend, my friend “John,” is dating the stage manager, “Elena”and have been since their sophomore year, and they’re seniors now. I’m a sophomore. “Elena’s” younger sister, “Kate” is a freshman and she and I became really fast friends. “Kate” and I were both cast in the same radio play this year. So was “John” and “Elena” was our stage manager. Over the course of the show, I started to develop a crush on “Kate.” She’s super bubbly, laughs at all my shitty jokes, and is quick to text back. In our texts, she loves complimenting me, especially my hair. The problem is the school situation. 

“Kate” and “Elena’s” parents signed them up for online school this year. I’ve been attending school in person and so I never see them outside of rehearsals for our play. Now that we’ve already recorded our play, I won’t get to see her around as often as during rehearsals. We do have a premier ceremony for the cast of that radio play that’s coming up soon, but after that, that’s pretty much it and I won’t see her around very much. Everyone in the cast will sign posters or letters for one another. After that though, that’s the end of the drama department this year because this show the four of us did is the last of the year. I won’t see “Kate” around as much as I did during rehearsals and I want to get to know her better, maybe get pizza or something. But I don’t want it to be awkward with “John” and “Elena.”

So, what should I do? I want to ask “Kate” out, but don’t want to mess with the friendship between myself and “Elena” and “John.” Knowing the two of them, I think it would be fine, but I’m still worried about making our friendship awkward. Should I ask their permission or something? I know that sounds ridiculous, but I’m not sure. Like I said, I just don’t want to damage the friendship between “Elena” and myself by possibly dating her younger sister. Then comes the second half of that, how do I ask “Kate” out, especially since we don’t see each other at school? I’ve been thinking of asking her out by writing on her poster at the premier, but everyone’s gonna see that because it’s passed around to everyone else. I don’t want to do it over text because I’m anxious about that type of thing.

All I want is either an equal, or someone that maybe has a bit more figured out than I do (no this does not mean money). 

Please dont roast me, I know this part is going to be lame... self plugging makes me cringe 

Basic info about me

\- 24 y/o female, I have my own place downtown, I have a great job that pays well (meaning I can fully sustain myself and even splurge), I have many friends, well travelled, well educated, hobbies include: hiking, skiing and camping, I have been told I am a positive person, physical attractiveness has never been an issue.

\- personality wise, every guy I have ever seen or dated has always wanted to continue our relationship and have told me I am fun and nice to be around. 

Ok now that aside, here is what I am experiencing:  

 I am meeting all these men (my age and couple years older) and what I am finding is that they are stuck in this frat phase. I am all about a good time, so I dont mind a party or a night out... just not sure I want it happening weekly. Even that aside, most if not all the guys I have met (15 of them), have stated that they have tons of roommates, lots of debt or financial issues, do not have a career path or even an idea of what they could possibly do with their life, no drivers license, they cannot cook, they dont enjoy cleaning. I have had to pay for most stuff date wise (wine at the park) etc.. which I do not mind, except for when it happens more than twice. In addition, the men I have been seeing have made some comments about my lifestyle and personal success, saying that I could be their ""sugar mama"", which is a joke.... but it still got me thinking. 

I understand there is no perfect person out there, that has it all. But I was hoping I could find someone that is my equal and that I can grow with, rather than feel like they need to catch up.

Lately there have been some signs that I feel she MAY be interested in me and I'm not 100% certain about it. 

She does give me a cute-sie look and I was thrown off because I've seen that look in other women before. It's the look where her head tilts down and looks her eyes look up on me.

A few weeks ago, we spoke and I told her I was quite disappointed that my ex and I split because I introduced her to my niece. And I don't want my niece to think that it is okay for her uncle to always have different partners. And she goes ""Wow, your moral values are so high. You're going to be an outstanding father""

Then, last week, when we spoke, I was in a super good mood and she couldn't stop smiling. So I asked her why she kept smiling and she responded ""you're in such a good mood it's contagious."" Then a few minutes later she smiled again and I teased her about it and she replied while laughing saying ""I don't know if you're teasing me or not about my smile.""

Are you spending weeks on end talking to your matches, unsure of when you should ask them out? You search everywhere and find that you should ask to meet after X days, and you do, only to get hesitation, rejection, or ghosted.

Here’s an idea, if you’ve exchanged a couple of messages and you’re still interested, ask them out on a date! Don’t ask them to “hang out” or “go for coffee” or “if they’d like to meet” or in some other beat around the bush way. 

Ask “would you like to go on a date with me?”

By being forward, you are showing confidence and being clear with your intentions. If they truly want to go on a date with you, they will say yes. If they like you, as long as you’re willing to meet in a public place, there is zero reason (pandemic aside) that they would hesitate.

Anything other than a yes with a confirmed date and time is a no. End of story. Stop wasting your time with people that just want to waste yours, and have no interest in actually meeting you.

My bf (38) and I (37) have been together a few years. I lost my job when the pandemic started, and not being able to really support myself sent me into a pretty deep depression. I tried  to sell art I had made during my unemployment, but that didn’t really do much and just made me feel more worthless. My bf was stressed because he was supporting us, and got resentful of me being home all the time and him having to work. Needless to say, our relationship hit a good sized brick wall in the sex department. 

I now have a new job, it pays well, but the hours are long and the commute takes up a lot of the time that he and I used to have available (and both took for granted) together. My job is paper pushing, nothing creative, but it is stable. My previous jobs were usually more suited to my creative side, and I felt more like myself at them. “Who cares about your job, this is the dating reddit” I know - getting there.

The past few months we’ve made an effort to make more time, be more affectionate, present, and chisel that brick wall from between us in bed. It’s going well, but sometimes my lack of self... idek what.. just self... gets me.

Now, I know these things are irrational. But I just don’t feel like enough sometimes. As I mentioned, we are still finding our groove in being regularly intimate, and I should state that I trust my bf completely and know he would never cheat on me. We practically grew up together and I know that’s just not the kind of person he is.

But today I texted, trying to be spontaneous and sexy, and he at first reciprocated.... then started talking about work and this woman he’s done a few jobs for. How she has her own business in his same field and that he and her have partnered up for things - she’s gotten him jobs and the like. 

It just... killed the whole vibe for me. Like I said, I know it’s my own insecurities and irrational jealousy but... CMON. No one wants to hear their partner start talking up someone else when they’re trying to be flirty and sexy. 

It doesn’t help that she is in a creative field, and is successful in what she is passionate about. Idk. I’m just being a big ass baby. 

Any advice on staving this insecurity and jealousy? I’m sure this gets asked a lot, but I don’t really have friends I feel comfortable asking about this. A lot of them are toxic in their relationships and I don’t trust their judgement  on my irrationality, or advice on how to kinda kill these dumb feelings.

A few months ago, a friend ask me out and said that “he wants me to be his last one.” Then he talked about moving in together. I rejected him.

At least for the first 2 times, they didn’t exactly say that they wanted to marry me but I was caught off guard. In addition, I felt like I was being trapped lol (just a feeling tho). However, I find such question to be valid since we get to decide if we are compatible or not.

Right now I’m dating to try and find someone to settle down with, get married, have kids, all of that. 

I’m not a perfect person and I don’t expect my partner to be either. I’ve been meeting a lot of really great guys, but I just don’t think they’re *the* guy for me. However, I hate hurting people’s feelings so I keep wanting to give these guys a chance even if I’m not feeling it right off the bat - because maybe things just need a chance to grow a bit, y’know? But at the same time, then I feel like I’m almost lying to them or leading them on because I’m still friendly and open and engaging but unsure if I want to proceed with a relationship. 

Today I went on a second date with a very sweet and cute guy. I wasn’t sure after the first date, but we had a decent amount in common so I figured we should go on a second date. He ended up confessing some deep emotional stuff on the second date and wanted to hold my hand for half of it and it just felt like too much for me, but we were in the middle of hiking a trail so I didn’t know how to turn it down. I did have a decent time with him despite that, however I just don’t feel any romantic chemistry.

We knew each other for about 4 years and started truly loving each other since early 2020, but before then it was mutually understood that we had feelings for each other but we saw other people in a non-relationship sense, FWB really. We met a few years ago and eventually she moved to another country and that’s when the feelings for one another truly came to true light, at first it was purely messing around as idiotic teenagers when we were around each other a few years ago, then it transitioned into a constant contact long distance and by 2020, we held a healthy relationship that was true and honest and transparent. It was not until late November that things came to an end when she was stressed with work and getting into school, which I completely understood. I asked if she was okay, we couldn’t understand why she felt bad, not at me but about her feelings being jumbled and confusing. I asked her to consider the possibility that she may have fallen out of love, and she confirmed after about three days. We remained best friends as I was there for her during her time with an abusive step father and a semi-negligent mother. I was hurt, but not by her, just the concept of it coming to a close. I still held a strong love for her because she was really my first true love of any kind that wasn’t somewhat fabricated. 

Shortly after this, less than a week before December, she comes and tells me she’s conflicted, she thinks that this isn’t a true end to things between us, and that it was perhaps distance that driven us apart. But considering how it was a strong relationship for so long being long distance, i said it’s possible, but it’s also possible that it was a genuine loss of feelings. so a long conversation ensued where it was known that we are both open to the prospect of a rekindled relationship, but that it should be natural and unforced. And that we should wait until we see each other face to face again on one of our many planned trips to Europe and Asia. If it rekindles, it rekindles, if it doesn’t, it doesn’t. Aswell as being open to new relationships should they arise. She confides in me that she doesn’t think she’ll ever really get to the point in another relationship that we had. Not to that same true level, I tell her that it’s not in anyone’s control, it’s a natural occurrence and shouldn’t be messed with, it should all happen on its own. Throughout all this time, we have been extremely close still, but on the platonic level on expressions. We still say to each other that we miss each other, we spoiled each other with Christmas gifts, and still call at least once or twice a week. 

Recently she has told me that she’s met someone, mind the fact that we never really stopped talking since the breakup. I was happy for her, and surprisingly not sad or hurt by it, I just wanted her to be happy and experience new things. I was her first relationship, she wasn’t my first relationship. But she tells me that she held off for about a week or two from telling me due to the fact of horror stories she’s heard of other people being stricken by sadness over hearing this type of news, but that she knew I wasn’t immature like that but still had to flip back and forth between whether or not it was appropriate to bring it up. She did, and I’m happy she did, I asked for her to describe the situation and it became a pretty good conversation on her having grown from the relationship we had, being more comfortable with relationships than she had before we were together. 

She says that he knows I exist and that we’re best friends, and that he isn’t opposed to that, but he doesn’t know the history between us that spans years. She didn’t know whether or not she should tell him, tell her that she should tell him if he asks or when it’s appropriate when it hits the point of love between them two, but she says “I don’t think me and him will get to that point, he just gives off that vibe”. She also mentions that she doesn’t see this as becoming a substantially long relationship between them. I ask if it is a FWB type of deal, and she says it isn’t, she sees it that if he were only in it for the sexual bit, that he would have already tried to do so. And that He’s a nice guy, he seems really chill and has a lot of interests with her, so I told her to not place it out of the realm of possibility. but I can’t help but wonder why it seems that she may be more open with me than to him or what it all means. I offered to give her a lot of space to pursue that new relationship, but she was opposed to me distancing myself. 

I still hold my feelings for her, I’m not entirely sure on where she lays on feelings, we still plan to travel together to Europe and Asia, and we still talk everyday.




Now for my questions, 

Does this rekindle at some point in time considering the fact that she doesn’t seem to take her new relationship to the point of seeing it build into love?

Where do her feelings lay?

What does this mean?

so this may seem like a weird question. 
My brother passed away a couple weeks ago. It was sudden and very upsetting, I’m still coping so keep this in mind while I explain my story. Because I’m probably just trying to keep my mind busy. 
Anyway, We had a celebration for him and a bunch of his good friends came which was so wonderful. I ended up going to hang with his friends afterwards and he had this buddy who I never met before and we chatted. Long story short I ended up staying the night because I had been drinking a bit nothing happened except some cuddles but he seemed like a really wonderful person and he really liked my brother and that made me d super happy. Well I texted him afterwards and said thank you for letting me stay etc. etc. because at the end of the day I know he was being kind. 

He hit me with a ‘it was nice to meet you, take care. ‘


Part of me is still thinking about him but since he said take care I felt like it would be weird to ask him if he wanted to ever meet up. He was single for sure and I felt extremely comfortable with him and maybe that’s just because I needed some tlc but I don’t know.  I in no way felt badly for staying either. 


Anyway my question really is if someone says take care’ should I assume that means “take care I won’t see you again” 

Obviously this probably seems really ridiculous. But my brain won’t stop replaying it/him 

Should I let be what it was? 

Should I text and ask him if he ever wants to meet up? If so how?

Being Asian makes you unique. Combine that with confidence and personality and you’re far more advantaged because you are different.

My only barrier has been not wanting to settle down because I’ve been there and done that; ie a 17 year committed relationship with a former model.

For starters- the elephant in the room if you will, me being black. I’ve grown up in a predominantly white town all my life and it has seriously fucked with the way I view dating, and myself. It took me forever to realize that guys probably don’t like me because of my race, not because I’m unattractive. It’s painful growing up in a situation where no one really likes you, sometimes not even your own race. Also, I feel like if someone does like me, it’s fake. I think I’m so used to not being chosen, that when I am chosen I second guess and I’m like ‘are you sure you like me?’. I think that’s my own problem though maybe. On top of that, there’s guys that fetishize black women so I have to be mindful of that. 
I’m also starting college next fall and the college I’m going to is a PWI. Thinking about it now, I feel like I should of chosen an HBCU, but it was really far from home and I really didn’t want to be too far yet, at least not till grad school. But the college I’m going to has great education, and has a great program for my career path. I always tell myself when I am feeling down, “just wait till college things will get better”, but.... will it actually? It might just be the same as high school where I feel like an outlier in the dating pool, and no ones choice.

I also dislike the way my generation views dating, with hookup culture and all that jazz. Everything moves super fast and it seems like sex happens before a first date. I hate this because I am super inexperienced with dating and sex, and I feel like I’m not gonna find anyone who’d want to take it slow. I haven’t had my first kiss, held hands with a guy, and I’ve only hugged a guy once, let alone have sex. And I want my first time to be special but that seems impossible with the amount of people who just want a quick fuck. Plus at my age, starting my freshman year of college, of course no ones going to want to take anything slow. The way I’d like it is, I’d want to be in a relationship with someone I love and trust, and who loves me before losing my virginity. But I’m scared that as soon as guys find out I’m a virgin they won’t want to take that time and they’ll dip. 
And the cherry on top of the sundae, we’re in a pandemic, and who knows when that’s gonna be over. This makes everything so much harder because not only are there extra precautions to dating, but people have gotten lazier. This pandemic has caused people to date out of boredom and it never gets anywhere, and I don’t want to waste my time with those types of things. 
I just want to experience a relationship, and dating and sex in a meaningful way but I feel like I won’t be able to. I try not to let the hopeless romantic in me cloud the reality of things, and I feel like what I want isn’t too unrealistic, just hard to find I guess.

It's just a lot to explain. 

I've been seeing this guy off and on for about five years now. We're best friends, crack each other up, talk multiple times a day... I can't imagine life without him. But it's been a long road getting to this point. 

Here's where it's getting messy. He lives with his ex, with whom he raises a child (hers, not his, but he's been there since the kid was a baby) that's now 12. For several years he would do the hot and cold thing, refused to ever say we were dating, want me when I was dating someone or stopped being interested in him, then tell me he ""just wasn't a relationship person"", come over and sleep with me in the mornings when he could get away with saying he was ""at the gym"" but never hang out with me otherwise. And a lot of this had to do with the fact that this ex he lives with (still lives with) would completely lose her shit each time she ever found out we were hanging out. She'd go through his phone and make demands and at one point she got so mad that she moved out for a few months, but of course moved right back in after that time, as she refuses to support herself. And he was so upset she left. So, anyway, she absolutely hates my guts (to this day) even though all I ever did to her was begin a relationship with her ex.... after they had been broken up for the better part of a year. 

Fast forward a few years and he now decides he does love me and wants to be together. However, he refuses to change his living situation. I have expressed that I need this to change if we are actually going to be a couple. But he's making zero effort to change it. I don't feel that he even wants to change it. I feel like he can't see how toxic this person is. And let me add also that I'm not a jealous person, I fully believe that they are not and have never been sleeping together since the day I met him, and if she had ever been even slightly reasonable I wouldnt even be having an issue with their cohabiting in order to raise a child. But she wasn't reasonable, has never been reasonable, texts him constantly when he's around me, and generally is awful. So that changes my outlook. 

I just don't know what to do now. Now that he says he wants this and is making an effort in so many ways. He buys me gifts, makes big efforts to see me and spend time and be sweet, helps me with home tasks, writes me handwritten letters all the time, and is very apologetic for his past behavior toward me because of her.

I don't have kids so I don't know the anguish one would feel living in a home away from their child. I guess my question is, am I being unreasonable in asking him to make a living situation separation? It's been nearly five years of this. And I don't see him changing it.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,689741,public,self,I need some advice about a situation,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mgxejt/i_need_some_advice_about_a_situation/,all_ads,6,,,

Just want to know what kind of person was she ? what type of mental health issues she was having ?

2 years ago , I met this girl who is sister of my friend. She confessed her undying love for me just after few months of the death of her ex-husband(who died of blood cancer and the marriage lasted 2 years). Though I liked the way she presented herself but still I was reluctant to talk to her because I thought it was too early to talk to somebody who's husband just died. She texted me , I replied and then it all started. She expressed her feelings , and told me that she used to like me a lot but got married due to family pressure and now she's madly in love with me. It all started from that point. She was full of life. but whenever I call her she was always like ""talk to me on video , open your cam and I want your attention"" , ""see my closet, look how organised my things are"", ""I always buy branded things"" ""I like expensive perfumes"", ""hey come on I know you don't say that but you love me too and as a lover you need to show your love and affection for me in front of everyone and must own me.""

I became so occupied with her demands that I couldn't decide what to do. but one thing that was keeping me in a relationship was her honesty. She was damn honest to me. I am not wrong but she has always spoken truth. Like telling me about her family, friends even the minor details of her life. She even reveals details about her family that I wasn't even interested in, like her mother's fight with her father, her family income, her father health issues. She trusted me, asked my opinions in various situations and thanked me for my support. She's given me lots of expensive gifts though her income was not too much.

I don't know why and when that happened but I fell in love with her. She asked me that if i really love her I need to confess my love for her in front everyone and propose her quickly. Just after an year when I really made up my mind to propose her. She was like ""better do it quickly , because you are making me wait"" ""If you really love me why not show your love for me in front of the world"". she said that now her mother taunts her too much that she's not getting married soon and constantly pressurize her to get married and start a family. she started talking to other rich and well settled guys who showed little interest in her and she thought that they might propose her and when I confronted her about that she apologized and said it's just because of the pressure she is facing from her mother.

After 1 and half year, she told me she just wanted to get married and needed a partner and now that I am making her wait she was like ""you don't care about my feelings"" ""you're a selfish person"" , ""you have no idea what i'm going through"" ""I'm facing pressure from my family"" ""people of my age group are getting married and I am not"" ""you are not listening to me anymore""

She started giving me ultimatums and left me with no choice but to marry her. Anyways, I was like ""okay, if you are happy with that lets get married"". just after that she became happy and decided a date for engagement and planned everything herself. She told me that she's bought clothes and other things. She was fully prepared. I don't know why but back in my mind many things were going on (I needed a break as I wanted to assure myself that everything i'm doing is not under any pressure) I wasn't very comfortable with everything. I asked her that i'm not very comfortable and if she can give me some more time. listening to this, she started hurling abuse at me, called me names  said a lot of bad things about me and my family, she said that she's decided everything now and now i'm taking more time. she said I have zero decision power and now i must get out of her life. I couldn't believe what she was saying I immediately blocked her and went no contact with her. She texted me from another number that she's very sorry for what she did, she was upset and now I need to accept her apology and get ready for engagement preparations. I blocked that number too.

It's been 6 months of no contact. I have heard that she's marrying another guy with a lot of money. I still miss her but don't want her back.

Frankly, when I'm stressed, my fingers look awful...

Like now for instance since it's the middle of the semester.

I hide my hands from people because of that. Honestly, I'm ashamed of them. I've tried countless meds and multiple therapist to help with my depression, ocd, and social anxiety; but nothing has seemed to work.

I don't even like having full body pictures taken without my hands being hidden.

I'm already at a heavy disadvantage since socializing has always been difficult for me. That, and I don't disclose much about myself given there's not many happy highlights of my life to bring up.

I just worry about what the impression would be given how awful my fingers can look and the inherent idea that biting ones fingers or nails means they're immature, childish, or strange.

It's been roughly 2 years since my last relationship, and honestly I've been a bit fearful to start again because my dermatophagia was the subject of far too many arguments. I don't want that to happen again since all it caused was resentment and a feeling of isolation.

But it's been a while, and I feel like I want to try dating again since I'm in a different city and I've spent a lot of time trying to improve myself and figure myself out.

I had been single for at least 2 years before meeting my catfish this last November. Things were amazing at first, she would send me all kinds of racy photos which I later came to find out we’re not here at all, but rather photos taken from the Twitter of an adult content creator from Florida. I didn’t see all the red flags early in because I was blinded by love from seeing what was going on. She would be there everyday, but her behavior was abnormal. If I would ask for a short video or her or to FaceTime or cam to cam, she would get secretly agitated and threaten to break up with me, even when I asked her to just make me a short video of herself telling me she loved me. It took a while for me to figure out what was going on, but eventually I did. I contacted the adult content creator from Florida to make them aware that their photos were being used in attempts to get gift cards for nudes. She did this with god only knows how many men, but then I looked up what Nigerian romance scammers do to their victims and every that that she did fit right into their scam script. I even opened a Netflix and gave her access, only to see that instead of the location she claimed to be in, the login was from....you guessed it, Nigeria. I flipped the hell out on the scammer and despite my best efforts to report them to the FBI, nothing has happened. People like her are really the worst, they hurt so many people. The whole experience has left me with a case of PTSD and severe depression. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to believe a woman if she tells me she loves me, or if I’ll ever be in a right frame of mind to try again. I’m going to start getting counseling to help with my depression which had become a constant. I’ve had a nervous breakdown before because of a previous GF lie to me and cheat on me with another man online for 4 months before finding out. Are there really honest woman left? I’m sharing my story as a lesson that if a woman with supermodel looks approaches you and tries to start a relationship wherein the are always asking for gift cards , don’t even say anything, just block them.
