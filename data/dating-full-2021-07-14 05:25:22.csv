In reality, and at least in my anecdotal experience. Personality (which for most people is easily interchangeable and adaptable when needed), is the probably the least important trait in dating, at least for long term.

Your personality (whether good or bad) means nothing if you don't provide intrisic value to your partner and the relationship.

He doesn't have the piercing yet, but he's wondering - when is the best time to bring it up during a date? Should it be brought up as soon as possible, in a very direct manner, or would it be more fun/playful to yawn and ""accidentally"" show it off?

So recently I met a girl in a very fun way. Let me develop. 

Act 1.

It was at night in an underground parking lot. I was with two friends and one of them was acting ... Drunk. 
At some point we see two girls in a car and he starts waving at them and then pointing at me saying ""he's the one who's free"" ... so dumb. I was embarassed and honestly thought he was bothering them.Also I just couldn't approach two girls while my drunk friend was watching and yelling dumb shit so we moved on 😂. We parted ways with my friends and I went back to my car to go home. 

Act 2. 

With my car I reach the exit where there are two automated barriers. In front of the left barrier I notice  a car that is not moving so I move to the right and end up right next to the other car.
It was the two girls from before 😂.
So the girl on the passenger seat talks to me she says they were waiting (on me?) for too long and now the barrier won't go up. I tell her to use the interphone to reach an agent but it was not working either they were soooo struck. At this point I feel like she's into me but I have to act fast.
""I know what you have to do"" I said. 
""Oh really""
""Yeah, but you have to give me your number first for it to work""
She says yes and give me her number and right when I'm done typing it in my phone the interphone started Working again out of dumb luck. I was like ""you see it was easy 😂""

To me it was a fantastic interaction but now ... I got ghosted after three texts. 

I tried my best not to be too invested right at the start and seem needy. I also tried to avoid bullet point questions but I think I've been overthinking those texts and they ended up not great. 

At some point she said "" you're not very talkative"" and never replied.

As I am an emotional person &amp; he is a way logical &amp; practical. i have told him so, &amp; he was scared that if we would broke up in future then I would be stable or not &amp; he doesn't want to hurt me that's why he wasn't opening his total feelings to me... He wants to open up but  whenever we meet (i hope so).... but now the thing is... Feelings are overwhelming for him &amp; he wants me totally ( if you know what I mean) we are not in relationship though... But I want some time &amp; don't want to jump directly on physical  mode.... I have told him, about this &amp; after 5 mins of yes-no argument he said ""let it be... But we're meeting for sure &amp; miss me"". So, now the thing is--
1. I am not getting what exactly in his head?
2. Why he is not leaving me? even if he knows whatever he wanted it requires some time at least from my side. Because any chick can give him that pleasure! 
3. Why he waited patiently for so long?? Like for 2 years??🙄 

It is hard to crack men's mind!! Huh!!🙄

Despite all of this, I haven't gone on a single date.

Now, I know what you're thinking, and before you judge me for not trying hard enough, let me clarify that there is a genuine reason for this. I struggle with mental health issues (depression, social anxiety, body dysmorphic disorder). This hinders my ability to talk to women, let alone go on a date with one. I am also physically unattractive, which does not help.

For context, I am a lesbian. I understand that, generally, most lesbians aren't picky. Surely, if women aren't that picky on dating other women, I should have an easier time to meet someone. Right? Even if it's only casual. Unfortunately, I've never been so lucky.

I recently went through a friendship breakup of sorts; I fell in love with her, but she didn't feel the same way. The pain of not being enough for this girl, who is one of my closest friends, has been eating me up from the inside. We're still friends, but I don't know how long that will last. To be honest, I'm not sure I'm even ready to meet other women. But I'm lonely. So fucking lonely.

This is something I probably shouldn't say, but will do so anyway. **Trigger warning:**

I overdosed on painkillers a few days ago. After being rejected by my close friend, I had an overwhelming desire to kill myself because I didn't think I'd ever find happiness again. I'm safe now, but it still hurts. A lot.

Is that pathetic? Am I just a lost cause?

And he did agree to go on casual dates with me if I was not comfortable with idea of FWB. 

Now we had been having a candid conversation yesterday where he clearly said he wanted to kiss me again( we haven't talked about it since we fought).

The way women react to tall men is unreal. It's literally not even worth trying to date when you're below 6'2. It's going to be endless compensating, and in the end the woman still won't be as attracted as she would be to a tall man.

A short guy has to be fit, good job, handsome and interesting just to be equal to some entirely average low income tall man - and even then it's not comparable, because the tall guy can simply achieve those things but the short one cannot.

The size difference is ridiculous - I'm like a literal child next to a tall man. It's not just height, height is just an indicator - its the size of hand, broader shoulders, bigger bones... A taller man is simply more massive. Everything on a taller man is bigger and more masculine. I cannot compete. Especially since I have thin wrists too, so its not like just the height is the problem, my entire build is child-like.

I (M22) had a relationship which lasted about 3 years, but ended in a terrible way, being cheated on by my ex. Since that, being pretty young (I was 99), I closed myself into emotional walls, not letting anyone, nor friends, nor other girls inside. I lived so for almost 2 and a half years, until last year. 

I'm an Italian university student, when the lockdown hit a colleague (F22) I barely knew started texting me for things related to university. Long story short, even if the last summer we lost a bit of contact we got pretty close, we even met a couple of times (just study related) , but still I was not ready to let anyone in, so I didn't make a move. But since October things changed, she started texting me every morning with the ""good morning"", we chatted about anything but university, and for the first time in almost 3 years I fell completely in love. We couldn't meet because of lockdown, but things became more and more personal, we talked about past relationships, she had a pretty sad background as well (I admit I was not very open about my past), we started exchanging some selfie too and, when possible, we even met a couple of time (not easy, we live 40km apart). I fell completely in love, never felt this way about anyone, and I felt corresponded, and just looking forward for summer to declare myself (I was so scared). 

We finished our exams, holidays started, I asked her out again and she told me there is just nothing between us. There was something that was warning me about this outcome, but I thought it was just scars or fears from the past, which I tried to fight, but in the end they revealed to be true. We keep texting, my behaviour towards her has changed, and hers as well, but still friends I guess? Cannot risk too much, after all she is my only studying partner. 

So yeah, not much I can do, just trying to get things out in front of strangers. Maybe this will help. As I said, I'm Italian, I did my best to write a decent text, hope it is appreciated, I'm sorry for any mistakes.

I've been dating for about the last two or three years and I always seem to find myself heartbroken, lonely or drained after each relationship/dating experience. 

I've dated about four or five guys in the last two years whom of which all lasted more than four months. We would go on dates a few times a week, they would introduce me to their friends and parents, and I would do the same. I always seem to think that it will end up in a relationship as it seems  they are keen to integrate me into their daily lives. 

After a couple months however it always seems to stay in the casual dating phase and they start giving me major 'friends with benefits' vibes or it either ends with them leaving to date other people/ghosting me. I **don't** tend to catch feelings easily in the beginning but after a few months I tend to fall harrdddd which I think also has to do with the sex.  This is super frustrating because they always seem to leave or we 'break up' when I've caught major feelings, which leaves me completely heartbroken for months afterwards. 

I know that the whole point of dating is to gain experiences and to learn from them, but I am seeing repeat patterns that are negatively impacting my self confidence and would like to learn how to rectify them. 

I have been told by my therapist and even past exes that I am 'too nice', which probably means that I am not assertive enough in relationships and with what I want. I really can't help this though, making other people happy, especially someone I care for is what makes me happy, however not to the point of self sabotage but I may not be a good judge of this.

This guy asked her to be his girlfriend because he wanted to have s*x with her and she said she won't do it unless they are in a committed relationship. In the past he has gotten physical with her and when she asked for commitment he said they were ""just friends"". She is currently mad at me because I called her out for not prioritising me and ghosting me whenever she pleases.

Another one of my friends is in an open relationship but plot twist- he keeps hitting on me even though I have told him I am not interested- I don't do open relationships. Most of my work colleagues are committed relationships or marriages. And lastly my closest friend right now will make a plan with me, but it will always end with us hanging out with her boyfriend's group because he always calls and she wants to see him. I have no choice but to go along with it.

The last remotely similar to a relationship thing I was involved in ended in him abusing me throughout my first time having s*x, me blocking him and proceeding to spiral into depression and severe OCD. I am now on medication and in therapy for the PTSD I have from the abuse.

Sometimes I want to go back to my abuser. It feels better than being alone. I feel so left out it feels like everyone is having s*x and related discussions and I've only done it once and even that was messed up.

The relationship felt like it was fading about 2 months before we even broke up, so I feel I did most of the grieving before formally calling it a day. I really was not sexually fulfilled, or romantically in a lot of ways. I did really care about her deeply though and the end was amicable, I just think both our needs were not being met.

Fast forward to a few nights ago. I met up with this super cool, super hot woman from OLD. We clearly had a lot of chemistry physically and emotionally as well. I just genuinely had a great time, she said she did too. We already planned to hang out again before leaving the date.

My initial assumption for myself would be that it would be good to date 2 (maaaybe 3) women at a time after my previous relationship, which lasted about 5 months. Obviously be upfront about it and all, so I already had another date planned with a girl. But then I went out with this woman. I had such a good time. I haven't felt quite that relaxed and playful with someone since I was in college. I have no idea if I want it to turn into anything other than a casual situation or if it could be anything more since I barely know her and I'm recently single, but I am open to getting to know this person. I kind of can't help but feel maybe trying to date multiple people isn't a great idea. I've done it in the past, I know how to do it. It's a lot though. I think sometimes I get swayed by my culture to try and do this when I'm not sure I have the energy to do so.

Is it a bad idea to try and date other women when I felt that much good chemistry with this person? I don't want it to be sabotaged later on by that if I end up liking her. Like I said I had another date planned, but I don't know, part of me feels it would be a whole lot better to just go out with the woman I have chemistry with. Am I doing anything unhealthy here? Should I keep the date?

I generally try not to overthink things, but I want my life to be easier, not more complicated. Any advice/experience is welcome.

I might update my profile picture once a year, and like a friend's post or picture every now and then if it's something that interests me a lot. He's about the same usage wise, but he might actually post something once a year if something significant happens in his life.

Well, the other day I got curious and was looking at his about section in his profile. He has it listed that he's currently single. We've been dating for 6 months now, so that seems odd to me. I know he's viewed his about section recently because he took the time to update his current city and workplace last week since he just got a new job.

Personally, I'd prefer to not be Facebook official for a while. I don't want all my nosy older relatives asking about us, so for that reason my relationship status is just set as nothing. You can't see it.

Now that I've noticed that his still says single though, it's been starting to bother me. Especially since I know it's not just something he hasn't thought about recently since he just went through his about section to edit it. It's not like our relationship is a secret. We've met each other's parents and our friends are aware that we're together. But, seeing that single status there has been giving me anxiety honestly.

Then we have talked about meeting in campus when he's having physical exams and if i ever go to campus from my online classes. However, that never happened due to the situation and we have always been hoping it to get better but it's just not happening.

So around mid June he finished his exams and I was going to finish my sem, but this was when i feel like we're losing the connection because he's spending less time on his phone and was recovering from a burn out. AND i completely understand he (an introvert) needs space so I didn't bother him too. 

But this soon leads to days till now where he no longer  tell me what's going on in his life (although i understand that there's nothing much and we are all doing the same thing over and over again still to being stuck at home). He no longer reply to my snaps like how he used to with texts and selfies. He no longer send me tiktoks like he used to everyday. And we said to stream movies tgt when im on my hols (which is now) but it didn't happen yet, and i dont think it's going to. Basically he no longer initiates much.

The only thing going good between us is that he still keep the streak going (snaps without text) and mininal replies to my stories and all. And his energy is still there through texts. Last week he still choosed the white heart filter when he sent a snap but that was it till tdy.

I'm so confused??? Like we were rly hitting it off with so many similarities and common values, interests, and i know it's kinda cringy as i'm typing this but we do have inside jokes and nicknames too. And tbh i think he's the first person ive ever met that's my ideal type.

So yes I can tell he's not interested anymore but i was thinking he could have straight off tell me that? On the other hand, I'm not sure why my intuition tells me that he has no idea what to do since we can't meet and know each other better (no one knows when our lockdown is going to end), or he needs time for himself to think things through so this connection is on hold. 

And I did not initiate anything throughout this weird period since he's like that. Was thinking if I'm wrong for this, is he just trying to see if I'll initiate since he mostly does it last time?

We've gone on a few dates and he always pays for everything and is very chivalrous. On our second date, he told me that he's moving to a different continent for 6 months. He told me I'm the 4th person he's told. The other day when we hung out he told me he is only interested in casually dating since he will be moving in the next few months. But the way he treats me is confusing and makes me think he wants more than an FWB relationship. Also, I'm so confused with what ""casually dating"" even means... Also he isn't dating anyone else and is only seeing me.

Things he does that confuses me:

Calls me beautiful

Took a picture of us on his phone

Stares at me and says I have pretty eyes

Very chivalrous

Tells me I was the cutest girl in his classes in college

Compliments me a lot

Plays with my hair while having deep conversations

When he found out I deleted Hinge he said ""Awwh you deleted it for me!!"" and was poking and hugging me

Teases me

We played a card question game and on one of his questions he asked me to kiss him and he saved the card

He told me when he comes back and if we get the chance we can try talking again

He remembers things I tell him and brings them up when I see him

Asks me questions like where I want to live in the future, how many kids I want, where I want to raise a family...

He asked me about us potentially going to dinner when he's in my area again, which I'm all for.

However, my ex boyfriend was one of his teammates in college. We had a very ""public"" relationship on campus. It's common knowledge between he and I so I never bring it up but, recently he has. Not once or twice but 3-4 times. He refers to us as this celeb couple, or says ""how do you date a new person after that type of relationship?"". I've tried to laugh it off and say, well that was 10 years ago, I've dated other people, and he's married now soo.. But it's beginning to turn me off.  I'm wondering if I should let him know that we might be better off as friends or attempt to see where things go.

Lately I've found a great girl and we're madly infatuated by each other but when we tried having sex a couple days ago, I could not get an erection for all things holy. There was just _no way in hell_ for my penis to even budge. We've been making out for a long time beforehand, I went down on her, she tried going down on me, body kisses, what have you - all to no avail, as if my penis didn't even recognize the situation. Never in my life had this happened to me and I was really disappointed by this fact. I'm healthy, I work out regularly, I have no troubles getting hard for masturbation but I do not do it excessively. During the past weeks, since I met my SO, I basically masturbated two or three times max cause I did not even feel the need to do that, being so preoccupied with my feelings towards her and her character. If anything, I had more trouble with random boners or getting hard at memories in my head in the past than _ever_ having a problem with an erection when I wanted it.

What saddens me is that I have no idea what went wrong and how I can prevent this the next time. As a consequence, I'm getting a bit paranoid over how things go the next time we try it in a couple of days cause I can't even pinpoint what went wrong to fix it. I'm blaming stress but I felt pretty calm (consciously at least) and very aroused during our interaction and yet penis was still limp. Also, how in the world am I supposed to even get rid of the stress consciously. This uncertainty is killing me cause I'd really like to be able to have sex with her but I don't have any idea what to do to make it work this time.

# Project background and goals
Searching for a significant other on platforms that match you with others based on an artificial profile score is very difficult. It subtracts any sort of authentic interaction between two people by replacing it with simple pictures and shallow descriptions.

The aim with this project is to create a dating platform that gives people a more authentic way of meeting someone, while giving more control over the kind of people that you meet.

# Core features
## Tag system
Since a core concept of this platform is giving the user the ability to find people who they would like, a system that is able to do that is very important. This system will consist out of two parts, interests and traits.

A trait is something that categorizes a user of the platform. For example, your list of traits could include: ""Cook"" or ""Parent"". Traits aren't meant to 'brand' someone, their only use is to make the account filterable. They can be acquired from filling out your profile information.

An interest is basically the same thing as what it means outside of a technical context, it's something that a person is interested in. A user is able to search for people with other interests by filling them out in a filter. 

## Meeting individuals
The first part of dating is meeting an interesting person. Since this platform won't include a way of talking face-to-face with someone, there must be a way for two people to meet each other. 

Instead of scrolling/swiping through a list of profiles, this platform will take inspiration from Omegle. On Omegle, you can start a conversation with a random stranger. This could be used to give people a chance for an authentic experience with each other.

The feature is quite simple. A person can connect to a 2 person chat-room with someone that matches their pre-defined set of tags and interests, both people can see this info at the start of the conversation. This will give both people an opportunity to kick off the conversation with something that they are both interested in.

When someone has a general idea of how the other person is, then they can choose to match, or to go to the next person. If the match option has been chosen, the other person can also choose to match or to go to the next person. If both people choose match, then the chat will stop and everyone gets redirected to a direct-message chat room between the two of them. If someone chooses to go chat with a different person, a reason has to be given. There is also a choice to not give a reason. After they go through with it, the conversation ends and a reason is given.

## Match making based on profile popularity
In the current online dating experience, being good looking helps extremely well. While being good looking is not a bad thing, it creates a situation in which average looking people get casted asside by the match-making algorithm. Instead of showing profiles of high interest to people, what if mid to lower interest profiles get shown to people?

This can be a simple option within the filter/meeting settings. It would ask you if you want to see profiles of the following popularity levels: low, average and high. This simple setting could create a more even playing field for average looking individuals since their profiles will be brought up more in the search results. It also will impact the way the [meeting individuals](#meeting-individuals) functionality works since profile with lower popularity scores will be chosen.

But how does this platform decide which profiles are popular? It uses the amount of unique views and match requests to determine if someone is getting a lot of attention.

## Interest blogs
While dating, it sometimes would be nice to read about the interests of the person you're interested in. This platform will enable users to write lengthy blogs about things that interest them. This can be useful for when you want to convey your interests in a more elaborate way. 

Blogs can be created on the profile page. When creating a new blog, A title, interest and NSFW warning must be given. When the blog has been written, it can be published.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,897429,public,self,Would you use this platform?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ok6wbj/would_you_use_this_platform/,all_ads,6,,,,,

It’s taken me nearly 2 years to get my Visa to get married and move to his country and now I have it, I plan to move there in a couple of weeks.

Although recently he’s been saying that he wants to sleep with someone specific before we get married. He’s been saying he’s had these uncontrollable urges to be with different women for a while (granted, it’s been a long time) but he has this specific girl that he wants to have sex with once. He finds her really attractive and can’t keep it out of his mind. He’s very open towards how he is feeling and communicative which is important.

He said it’s nothing but sex and he’s not looking to date her, he’s just interested in trying it as he hasn’t had a lot of sexual experience and wants to get it out of the way. 

It does hurt a bit but at the end of the day I don’t mind because we are not really ‘together’ at this point as it’s been a while, I feel it’s good to get these urges out of the way before we settle.

He loves me and calls me everyday, he really doesn’t want to lose me and wants a life with me but he can’t seem to control this. He cries all the time about feeling guilty, so I feel it’s important to let him explore for a bit.

Me and 20M started talking on the basis of becoming FWB. We met up, watched a movie, and hooked up. Quite quickly, he was communicating with me but it had such little substance. It was more of a ""hi/how are you?/good?good"" pattern. Eventually I decided to make him call me, which he did, but then everything started to crumble... long story short, we stopped talking.

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks later, he hits me up again and I demand answers. He says that I scared him because he was starting to fall for me and he did not want to be a boyfriend, basically. And my thing is, I thought we were just FWB, where is this 'boyfriend' idea coming along? I was transparent tht I didn't want a relationship either in the beginning so that whole ordeal was strange.

We found a stable ground of getting to know each other through text for the next couple of days, then we hung out again, bonded, and hooked up. And then, we hung out again the next day. This man drew me, took pictures of us, and was being extremely amourous with me. We looked like a couple.

 I went home to texts of him saying how it felt so right being around me and he found a good thing... So we met up again, bonded, hooked up. He asked if I could visit him on his side of town (he lives an hr away) and I said sure. He told me he would call me in the morning when he was ready, and I said ""sure."".

&amp;#x200B;

Tell me why, the next day I give him that good morning text and was returned with a long breakup paragraph. He said that he really liked me a lot but he wasn't ready for a relationship because he does not know what love is. He said he does not love himself and that his main focus. He felt I deserved something better because he did not want to break my heart and we should take a step backwards.

I was angry and confused because I didn't do anything out of pocket to encourage a relationship, yet he was. And I get broken up.. didn't even know we were in a relationship. The sad part is, I really felt like we were starting something and I was starting to genuinely like him, but I never disclosed that to him.

Sorry, but I can't help but laugh at how hypocritical people and society are sometimes. This sub loves to dish out advice about being on your own, being solitary and being so independent and just living your whole life on your own....on a sub that's supposed to be about companionship and dating(lol) but last year everyone was going nuts over not getting laid for a few weeks. Meanwhile you all tell others that sex and relationships aren't a big deal and that guys like me just need to touch grass because we romanticize relationships too much.   


I'm willing to bet that if most people here never got to date or haven't for years, they'd be singing a largely different tune. Stop telling others to be happy on your own and then on another post talk about how happy you are with your partner and that you wouldn't know what you'd do without them.

Over the 4th there was a situation where she didn't invite me to a 4th of July party she was going to. Especially since we hadn't been dating for very long, I totally get why she wouldn't have invited me. However, what peeves me is that she FaceTimed me on her way there to the pool party – she looked amazing – and said she would let me know if she could invite me after she got there. What was frustrating about that was she could have said virtually anything else and it would have made sense. Instead, it sounded to me like she wanted to scope the options available to her at the party and to see if she wanted to bring sand to the beach. She later apologized and we moved on.

Now, there is a club event thing happening on Friday that her friend invited her to and it sounds like maybe her friend got her a ticket at some point yesterday before they sold out – tickets were $10. Prior to that, she invited me and I said I would like to go if it wasn't meant to be a girls night or anything. Upon reading the description of the event, it says it's oriented towards couples and/or people looking to couple up. She has acknowledged this is the second time something like this has happened in less than two weeks and is sorry about it but she'll come to my place after the event.

I am still peeved by the situation. I cant help but think that if the script were flipped, if I was even debating going to an event that's happening soon – and clearly oriented towards couples/finding someone –  I would have just grabbed 2 tickets for $20 and sorted it out later. But if tickets were sold out before I could do that and my person couldn't go, I would have rain checked my friend's invite.

Lately, I've been preferring to date older women even though as a mid 20's man I should be having lots of options with other ladies around my age, but like a lot of men in here can tell you it's most likely not the case. It basically boils down to: **It's less work for me**. Obviously, it's not always the case, but in my experience, the older ladies are more direct with what they want, need, and like.

Things that older ladies do that younger one can:

1. **Make the first move**. I know that most women wait for men to do this or they make really bad first moves like smiling at him or just moving a little closer to him. Listen those ""first moves"" are terrible and don't let a guy know you're interested. I know it's scary to talk to random people, but 90% of the time men won't mind if a woman comes up and starts talking/flirting with them. The only negative experiences I've had with women coming up and talking to me randomly are when they are very drunk, every other time it was a fun time and I never thought negatively of them. Women also have a huge advantage in the flirting area, you can be forward than men without being called a creep or having their friends run interference. You can touch men faster than men can touch women.

2. **They let me know what they like.** This isn't just in the bedroom but in everything. Do you know how much less pressure is on me when I know what you like? This doesn't take away any of the surprise or romance, this will literally make you happier if your partner knows what you like and how to make you happy and you can kick people to the curb who doesn't do the things you literally tell them to do.

3. **They aren't looking for Mr. Perfect.** This is mostly a younger thing from what I've seen, but older women know Mr. Perfect doesn't exist and are okay with that. I don't know how many times I've been rejected by women around my age for random reasons, but it happens far less as I go older. For example, I currently can't afford my own place, younger ladies have a problem with this while older ones understand that I'm saving and it's crazy expensive so it makes sense a person who just finished college can't afford one.

4. **They let me know they find me attractive and enjoy their time with me.** This one is huge! It's shocking how many women do not let the man they are going on dates with if they find them attractive or if they enjoyed the dates. Just a simple follow-up text after a date saying that you had fun and look forward to the next one, this means so much. Also, if you find your date attractive or hot, LET THEM KNOW! Men also want to feel desired and hot just like women do.

I don't have a fetish for older women or anything, it's just like I said before it's less work for me to date them and I actually feel wanted and attractive.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,897616,public,self,Why I'm preferring older women as a mid 20's man,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ok956n/why_im_preferring_older_women_as_a_mid_20s_man/,all_ads,6,,,,,

I have never gotten into dating apps until I got vaxed this spring and was ready to make a big push to find a partner.

I signed up for bumble and started swiping. I haven’t gone out with a ton of girls but the ones I have chosen to go out with have all seemed like a good fit from the get go.

Two of the last three (over the past 3 or 4 months) have both played out the same:

Really long first date - one agreed to meet for coffee and the other was lunch. Coffee date ended up going to the park and walking and talking for a total of over three hours. Other first date was lunch and ended up going to a coffee/dessert spot after. Both dates split everything 50/50.

Good communication and second date in the first week.

Second date goes the same as the first. Obnoxiously long dinner where we sit and talk forever then extend the date with something unplanned - bar or movie after.

From there things seem good but then within the next week or two they just kind of tucker out and I feel like I’m putting in all the work only to hear radio silence when I request plans for the upcoming weekend.

The whole time things seem good and we’re laughing and having a good time when we’re together only to have it be the opposite when we’re not.

I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong and would appreciate any advice.

FWIW I’m tired of cheap sex and not pursuing that kind of relationship but I still try to get it across that I’m physically interested in them by complimenting or physically touching when the time is right.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Massage therapist Mike - Nice guy online, seemed shy and reserved and relatively sweet. He booked us a painting event at a tavern in town which I was really excited for. It was a great date idea. The night of the event arrived, and so did the worst blizzard our city has seen in 30 years. To give you context, it was so bad that the main highway that runs through the city was snowed in and inaccessible. Semi trucks were either stranded or stuck in ditches. When I reached out to him to ask if we could reschedule (offering to help pay for any cancellation or rebooking fees), he got angry and said ""what... do you not want to hang out with me?"". I assured him I wasn't coping out, it was just yno... completely dangeous out there. All flights were cancelled, buses were stuck in ditches, some people had no power and the radio was telling people to stay home. Like an idiot, I got in my rinky dinky little car and tried to get out to the tavern where this event was happening. I turned up about 10 minutes late despite leaving extremely early from my apartment, I was sliding through stop signs and crawling at 20 for most of the way. I kept in touch with him along the way so he knew. Upon my arrival, it was clear he was moody with me, and to be quite honest I was shocked the event went ahead, as 70% of the reserved seating were unoccupied, clearly due to the bad weather conditions. The whole evening was like pulling teeth trying to get him to talk. At the end of the event I looked at our paintings and joked about how at least we know we could never be career artists. Mine looked terrible, and his looked equally bad. I expected it to pull a laugh, but instead he coldly looked at me and said ""so you are saying my painting sucks then?"". Granted, I probably put my foot in my mouth on that one, but both of our sunsets were BROWN instead of the vibrant reds, purples and orange that the instructor was painting. I thought it was really funny, but he was not amused in the slightest. After 10 minutes of stony silence he suggested we go home, and I was definitely ready to leave. We gave each other an awkward hug and said goodbye. The drive home was awful and I also had to stop and give a homeowner my information after witnessing someone hit their parked vehicle and take off. He never texted me but I messaged just to make sure he got home ok. His reply was ""yup. Ha. Thanks."" So I took that as a definite sign the date went terribly for him and shrugged it off. Two days go by and I'm sitting in a coffee shop (alone) and I get a text. ""Just saw you sitting in (coffee shop) casually reading your book. It's nice to know you can rest easy after ghosting someone so callously. Its not really a loss for me though, considering you feel it's socially acceptable to turn up late on a first date. You aren't for me, all the best"". Good riddance. 
2. Geologist Trevor -  This guy was what you would call ""husband material""... but only on paper. Very successful, well dressed, fit, witty and attractive. Superficially, he left a very good impression. From the get go this guy was INTENSE, but my interpretation from the beginning... perhaps naively... was that he just knows what he wants and is ambitious. He was visiting home when we first started talking, so there was no way for us to meet up for around two weeks. He would text me from 6am to 10pm... with a couple facetime sessions in between. In those two weeks I felt like I was run ragged. It was a lot of communication and my job performance was suffering as he would get anxious when I was slow to reply. On multiple occasions I had to tell him to slow down as he was starting to profess intense feelings for me without having even met me. On our first date, we made pizza together and things seemed fine, I decided to leave even though he invited me to stay over. When I got home he interrogated me about why i ""ran out of there"" like a scared mouse, but I assured him that he had misinterpreted that and I simply don't sleep over on the first date... which he accepted. This is where things went weird. He picked me up for our second date and mentioned we would be checking out a house he wanted to buy... what i didn't realize was that we would be doing this ALL DAY, and that he had told the realtor he was bringing his girlfriend. If you don't think this is weird, imagine you have just met someone, and without asking you for a relationship... they take you to multiple prospective houses they want to buy while introducing you as their girlfriend, and as a result the realtor asks you for constant input on what ""we"" are looking for and whether spare rooms for kids or guests are important factors for us. Not only that but this guy you have been on ONE date with starts painting mental pictures about you cooking in the kitchen or building a studio in the backyard for my crafts, and making references in front of the realtor about where ""our"" bed was gonna be in the master bedroom. I was very rattled and weirded out, and when I told him it seemed a bit weird to go house hunting on a second date... his response was ""its only weird if you make it weird"". Ok. The next morning he didn't text me in the morning, which I was relieved about because I needed space to clear my head and think..... unfortunately this was apparently some sort of shit test because just before noon he sent a cold ""wow, I guess I only get texts from you when I message first"". I told him I just felt things were moving too fast, and that I needed to focus on my work during the day but that I was open to facetiming and phone calls over lunch. He exploded on me... then stonewalled me for two days despite my positive and upbeat messages to try and resolve the conflict. So after my messages were ignored, I blocked him. Within minutes of me blocking him on whatsapp... He then called me hysterical and said that his ex was to blame for the way he acts and that he wanted to work things out. He then digressed into some tyrade about how evil she was and how he could poison her and get away with it, and wouldn't even feel bad if she got hit by a bus. It was at that point I realized I had wasted enough time and that this guy was unhinged... so I said this wasn't working and he then tried to pretend like it was his idea to stop seeing each other and I played along because frankly I just wanted out. Even more weird was that after I started dating my current boyfriend this year (nearly a year after I dated this guy) I reset my whatsapp which meant all my data and settings were reset... within 20 minutes a text pops up from him ""thank you for unblocking me finally (wink emoji)"". Barf.
3. Klutzy Kevin - This one is more miserable for the guy than it is for me, but it still qualifies. Met up with this extremely kind but nervous guy who I knew right off the bat I wouldn't have any developing chemistry with. He was really sweet however, and we had some nice conversations over dinner. He was truly endearing, but deeply nervous as he hadn't been on a first date since his divorce... of which he spent about 2 hours discussing, despite repeatedly trying to stop himself. He probably apologized at least 20 times for speaking about his ex, to the point where the bartender seemed to be suffering from so much second hand embarrassment that he actually refilled my wine glass without asking me. Now...people go through shit, and I honestly had a deep amount of sympathy for him and did not feel offended, but I knew he wasn't ready to date at that point. During dessert he asked the bartender if he could handle a rather expensive bottle of tequila from behind the bar as he was hoping to buy some at some point. For enthusiasts, it was a bottle of **Clase Azul,** which comes in a beautiful porcelain bottle. Well, as he handed it back, it slipped from his sweaty, shaky palm and smashed into pieces onto the marble floor, the whole restaurant stopped to look and he frantically asked for the bill and apologized profusely as the bartender and a couple servers attempted to clean up the mess. I felt so badly for him, It was humiliating for him. The restaurant agreed to his offer of half the value since the bottle had been barely opened which meant he tacked on an extra $120 to our restaurant bill. I offered repeatedly to help him out and split it as it was an accident but he just wanted to get out of there. Since he had picked me up from my apartment, he had to drive me home. The whole way he was trying to make light of the situation, but was super distracted as he drove, I kept having to remind him that the light was red, or that the turns he was making were down one way streets. About two blocks from home, he rear ends someone who is stopped at a light. While him and the driver exchanged information, he suddenly had to sit down as he seemed to be having breathing issues,  and I ended up flagging down a EMS vehicle that miraculously happened to be driving by at that moment. The EMT suspected he was having a panic attack and took him through a few breathing exercises to help him calm down. He suggested that someone drive him home. The other driver had left at this point after taking pics of damage, and so I ran the two blocks home and grabbed my vehicle and drove him back into downtown to his apartment building while his vehicle, with the bashed front end, remained parked down the street from my building. He thanked me for the lift, and then said that this probably wasn't a good time for him to be dating. I wholeheartedly agreed with him, and made sure he was doing ok the next day and then we went our separate ways.
