Eventually I told him to stop and he unfollowed them all off of social media. He doesn’t typically unfollow people. He is the type of person who is on good terms with everyone. 

And when he started dating his eventual long term girlfriend, and I’d be polite, make small talk and ask about her, he’d frequently tell me that no, he didn’t think they’d end up together forever, or that something about her was annoying. 

He never did that with ANYONE else but me. And they seemed so happy together.

There is this boy (21M) in my (20F) class that I find really attractive. Since the first day of class, he has been sitting next to me (I've been sitting at the same spot) and our class meets three times a week. He is on our school's volleyball team, and since I am acquaintance with some other guys on the team, I started going to their games and enjoyed it even though I wasn't interested in volleyball prior to knowing him. 
The thing is that he is not only physically attractive to me, but I also like his ideas and opinions during class discussions. We would giggle at the same time and have the same exact movement when the professor says something funny.

One time our class met on Zoom because the professor was busy, some of us still came to the classroom and joined the meeting. 
1. I saw that this boy pinned my screen
2. There were a lot of empty seats around but he still sat next to me

I met a person on a dating app who shares the same values interests, qualities and doesn't live far from me (most of the guys on the app do). We spoke for a week and got to know each other a little.

I gave him my number through the app and he replied a few hours later.

I was in a bad place at the time (had many issues with my family and my mental health). I did not want to mess things up. I replied to his text 10 days later. I explained I was unwell and had lots of things going on with my family and asked how he was.

I really like him. I regret not texting him straight away! :( I would have asked him out on a date. It's been 2 days since I texted him. I feel like I have messed things up. I could send him another text and ask him out on a date. However he has not texted me back and I don't want to be seen as desperate. Maybe he thinks I'm not interested in him.

At first we talked for 5-6 days before I told her I don't think I want to be in a relationship as I felt unworthy of her and started to feel stressed out. (For reference I'm 18 and she's 23) So I made up some excuses and we stopped talking after that. But for the next 3 days the regret started pilling higher and higher as we had insanely good chemistry I've never felt with anyone before so I texted her and in the same night asked her out on a date which she accepted, our date was a week from the day I asked her out as we both had packed schedules. We talked for another week online before we went on our date. Our date was very successful and we botn had a lot of fun. So we didn't talk much after the day of our date cause I was extremely tired and here is where it started going downhill. A day after the date we hop on a call to talk and she said that she wasn't looking for a long term relationship and that she wanted something semi-casual which I was alright with since I would be going abroad for school next year and wouldn't want to bring anyone with me. For the next few days I felt that she was becoming more and more distant by not replying to my texts even though she has been online and I thought she was slowly becoming uninterested in me. And eventually it started eating into me I couldn't control myself but to feel insanely needy and stressed out, I felt like I couldn't function or focus on anything for the whole weekend. And ultimately we had a talk about it and I gave her the choice whether to work it out or leave it as it is. And she choose the latter which is understandable cause we've only known each other for 3 weeks and she wanted a semi casual relationship which I wouldn't be one of the top piorities of. At first I felt kinda relived cause I could finally get rid of this needy stressed out feeling and focus on work. The first week went by well, I only thought about her a couple of times but then the second week was UTTER TOTURE. I can't stop thinking about her and it has started to get really annoying. I also have been thinking of texting her for a week now hoping to reconsole but is that a good idea? I saw that she has been back on the dating apps which is understandable too.

Its like theres no substance to her despite me trying to engage her in pretty heavy loaded topics. Her answers are short and she doesnt expand on the topics , she barely asks me questions, which is weird cause arent you trying to get to know me? 
If I mention a serious car accident I was involved in, you'd think she would want to ask for maybe more details but she just says ""oh no"" 🤣😂 like, tell me you dont give a f* without telling me you dont give a f*

Looking through the chat you would think I was the thirsty one because of how detailed my texts are in comparisons to hers. 

Getting something out of her is like pulling teeth since im constantly leading the conversation, i'm obviously not gonna pursuie her any longer so im not really looking for advice but, what is it that makes people trash conversationalists. 

Me, im a chatterbox. Not only will I be able to speak non-stop about various topics (media, religion, space, aliens, videogames, ancient history, travels, food), but Im able to set the stage for whoever i'm talking to have several opportunities to expand on whatever they want to talk about. Asking questions, clarifications, opinions, experiences. Yet, the best they can muster are one word fucking answers, which essentially KILLS the potential for a larger more open ended discussion. Then you have to start over from scratch and come up with something else cause she sure the fuck won't. 

Again, its easy to chalk it up to her just not being interested (I did the 1st time we spoke), but like I said, she usually texts me first. 
Im so confused... and maybe theres something im missing?

At first I didn't think much of it, but then it went into the nitty gritty details of why and how it happened even getting into a lot of really personal stuff. To the point where anytime I brought anything else up during the date (like my brand of chapstick) it was brought back to his previous relationship or he would connect it to a sexcapade that him and his ex wife had. He told me intimate details of their sexual life including all the three somes and crazy things they tried. Like, exact play by plays of his whole sex life. In fact I think I know more about his ex wife's sexual interests than I know about him. I told him that I was quite uncomfortable hearing a lot of this information since we had just met and that I needed sometime to think about things. 


I don't mind that he has a past at all, but as someone trying to get to know him romantically it just seemed kind of like a conversation you'd have with a friend or way further into a relationship if both people are comfortable with that level of detail.

27F, been on and off the apps for years. I’ve tried them all, I’m now trying bumble because the guys that have been reaching out to me I wasn’t interested in (luck still sucks). The one time I dated a guy for a few months, I wanted it to end because I feel like I settled due to lack of physical attraction. I feel like I settled because of low self esteem. Now, I’ve been on bumble for a brief while and met up with two guys. The first guy seemed to like me but I didn’t like him. I met up with another guy, we talked for a few hours and he seemed interested in meeting up again. I liked him up till the second meetup, he ended up irritating me &amp; called it quits (I’m not lying when I say he just beat me to it). I want the romance from dating, just a little note that I don’t really have sexual desire. I like the thought of intimacy like kissing etc but I don’t masturbate and haven’t had sex in years. Could that contribute to my lack of success? Or am I just not meeting the right guys? I feel like dating shouldn’t be this hard, my life is all about shutting down the ones I don’t want &amp; the ones I do want don’t feel the same way. Quite frankly, even if I’m ace I don’t see how that would affect my dating life especially in the early stages. It’s all about getting to know the person anyway, I don’t think that all guys just want sex. I don’t think I’m terrible looking, I don’t see how I’ve only attracted men I don’t want.

We started chatting in May and both wanted long-term relationship but he was my first relationship and I was his fourth, and that too after a toxic 3year relationship that ended the year before.

I went home for a month vacation in December and a week after I came back, he said he's not interested anymore. I got confused as though home was a different country in a 10hr ahead timezone and I tried to make best of the situation and I thought we were doing pretty well. We had a good time the day before I left and two days after I came back. Then a week after that, he said he thinks we are not compatible therefore started losing interest and don't want to work on things with me. Hurts a lot, questioned myself a lot and told him to take a month to think clearly as I was feeling off the week I came back and was like seeking conflicts with him. I like hanging out and doing stuffs but couldn't do those as my housemate tested positive. So I explained everything and how I thought we still compatible and asked him to tell me in a month. I broke NC twice, once a day after he messaged me asking to drop off my stuffs and second was when I was tipsy. Both times, he replied nicely and was understanding. I was curious about his life but he wasn't about mine so that tells me a lot I guess.

So, my question is, how do you know if you're compatible? How do you know if you are losing interest? How do you know if things won't work out if you don't try? On a 6hr long call after the breakup, he said he doesn't see how we could work out. I'm hurt and while I gave him a month, today is 2weeks exactly since we broke up and I now understand there's little chance of a second chance.

I have no doubts that men guilt/emotionally manipulate women too, I just don't know what forms it takes, so any insight is appreciated

In my years of dating, especially as dating apps have become more and more widespread, it's become basically acceptable and sometimes even encouraged to be manipulative towards others. You might see this in common things like someone saying the right things to keep another person ""hooked"", so to speak - how many posts have you seen asking for advice where the poster describes the person as ""engaging in the convo"" but unwilling to meet? Or someone who seems only half-invested in a relationship and does just enough to keep the other person around? How often do we hear a story from a guy or girl trying to talk to their SO about a problem, only for that SO to find a way to blame the other person and make them feel bad?

What I've experienced, as a guy, is a lot of being guilted or blamed. Most of the time it's things like someone flaking/ghosting on a date, then giving me a story about that makes it sound like something urgent came up that'll make me feel bad for them (or just feel bad in general). I've heard all sorts of excuses - ""My roommate is going through a tough time and she needs me"", ""Something is wrong with my dog"", ""My mom called"", etc. Sometimes these things actually do happen, but most of time it's just the other person crying wolf; these are excuses that sound legit and that make the other person look like a dick if they question it. On the more extreme end are the people who blow up on you and try to make you out to be the bad person after they flaked/ghosted/did something wrong

I get it sometimes - rejecting someone can be hard and uncomfortable. Agreeing to a date and then realizing you're not actually feeling it is a tough spot to be in. But rather than being honest, we decide to make it even more convoluted. And we encourage this type of behavior, even though most people will complain about it too, ironically enough

In a way, can you blame them? Why be honest and risk feeling shitty for rejecting someone when you can just throw it back at them, avoid those ""bad"" feelings, and then get praised for it by others in your echo chamber? For women on dating apps particularly, I've noticed, this is easier to do because they almost always have a line of desperate guys to validate them

I've always believed in being honest with someone. I've broken up with people, I've canceled dates just hours before, and while it never feels good (and it doesn't really get easier) in the moment, I always make sure to just tell them the truth - ""Hey, I'm sorry, but I'm not as into this as I thought I would be"", for instance. They don't need to hear about my cat getting run over or how I accidentally blinded myself with toothpaste while getting ready for the date. The other person will be hurt, no avoiding that, but in the long run they'll appreciate being treated like an adult

It really is sad that we've made manipulation and guilt such a normal part of dating culture. I think it's a big part of the reason why so many of us are unhappy with trying to date and why we struggle meeting people. A little more honesty, both with ourselves and with others, would go a long way

Finally, because this needs to be addressed: I know there are guys out there who don't handle rejection well and may even blow up on the other person to the point of threatening them. I get it if a guy isn't getting the message after the first rejection and someone feels compelled to just make excuses (or ghost them). But I've also met both men and women who complained that ""the other person can't take a hint"", but then I find out that they never rejected them or told them they weren't interested; they'd just make excuses and/or be passive-aggressive and let it all drag out",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1157577,public,self,It's sad how we've normalized emotional manipulation and guilting in dating,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sm4is6/its_sad_how_weve_normalized_emotional/,no_ads,0,,,,,

He chose to cheat on me instead of communicating.

I move on, it’s whatever to me so I don’t take it personal, until he calls me 2 months later. He tells me he had gotten carjacked and was going through the trauma of that….. He wanted a chance back with me, I did like him so I said ok… 

Things were going okay until recently. I personally felt confused around him about how he felt with me, we haven’t been on a real date since we’d reconnected. When I talk about my life he seems uninterested, looks at his phone. I had also realized that I couldn’t form an emotional connection with him, truly be vulnerable and trust him. So I ended the “situation” with him in person and he seemed understanding, gave me a hug and kiss on the forehead and told me that it’s okay. I felt relieved after I ended things with him - it was the right thing to do.

3 weeks go by then yesterday he calls me randomly and tells me that he never wanted a relationship with me- never saw any longevity with me that he didn’t understand me, that I’m one of the strangest people he’s ever met, that he knows it has nothing to do with him and his character and that I don’t know what I want. Lastly that when I say “there’s no point in arguing because my answer is still the same” that I am rude and it’s hurtful to him. 

I couldn’t listen to him anymore and hung up. For me, I didn’t mind listening to him vent but it had gotten disrespectful and his true colors came out.

Had a really lovely first date where we talked for hours and have a lot in common.  He then suggested meeting the following weekend.  We met for a coffee and again, chatted for ages.  He then suggested meeting back up that night as neither of us were busy - we watched a few episodes of a TV show and chatted.  He again asked about doing something next weekend.  Just as he was leaving, he mentioned that he doesn’t meet people and this was out of his comfort zone, but he has had a great few weeks. He then said that he wanted me to know that he wasn’t sure what he wanted, as he had a really difficult break up a year ago - and he felt it was only fair I knew this.  

I wish he had made this clear from the beginning.  I do believe him about the breakup being difficult and he is a really lovely guy - so I don’t think he is trying to stop seeing me/wants to date lots of girls, he would be honest (friends in common and a few other reasons as to why I believe this - but I know there is always a chance).  

I guess I am a bit confused, as he has been so forward and initiated more meet ups and has constantly suggested a few things (lending books, cinema trips in the future etc).  My friends think that he does like me and wants to continue, but has maybe got closer than he thought quickly, and didn’t expect it? 

I think I’m going to text him at one point, as I genuinely am very interested and I typically don’t feel connections with people easily.  I’m just not sure what to say? 

I also wondered what to do if we do carry on dating - i need a lot of time to trust someone, so I don’t mind taking things slow.

I am going to try and keep this brief. So, I started speaking to an exchange American student for a month on Tinder before we met. During our chat's we had realized that we had a lot in common and his texting demeanor was more pleasant and warm. We had our first date over two weeks ago and I believe it went well. We ended up talking about life, our passions, and our goals. We ate and then went clubbing. We ended up kissing on our first date.

Fast forward to our second date, we had planned to go to the gallery which we did. Later we went clubbing again! And we made out. Since the timings meant that his train was hours away we decided to go back to mine. One thing led to another and I gave him oral and he slept over for two nights.

Recently, our conversations started to turn rather strange. He found out some derogatory words my culture uses against his race. And we ended up making an inside joke about it. But personally, I found it distasteful. We ended up adding each other on Tiktok and WhatsApp. From there I saw this online etiquette change. He used to call me endearing words in Spanish to nothing. Also, he'd ignore some of my messages on different platforms and reply to be super late. I noticed when we had a phone call he kept referring to me as 'babe' and I recall not reciprocating his words. Also we share a Spotify playlist and he usually added romantic songs, now he started to add breakup songs such as Jungle from Boogie with da Hoodie. I asked him about it and notified him he was giving the wrong signal to which he replied oh don't worry about it, it means nothing... but would you add such a crass song to a playlist you share with someone you just dating?

He also recently admitted he suffers from depression and anxiety and has breakdowns quite often. This is after we already discussed that we don't want to date emotionally unavailable men. He also randomly texted me after a phone call and said I had a crying breakdown. And he also mentioned that after he went home after one of our dates he went into a three-day depression and didn't leave his room. All these things have been wearing on me. During this whole ordeal, his change in attitude has been taking a huge hit on my confidence and giving me stress.

I feel bad because I don’t want to drive him away (though he mostly finds it endearing/likes the devotion I think. Im not like calls him 20 times insane clingy, just text him often and really want to be around him all the time. Oh and like constantly cuddle him when we are together- but he’s also affectionate like that so he reciprocates that).

I also am kinda sensitive so if he rejects me it hurts. He doesn’t usually but sometimes he does. I do know he has more work than me atm and has a harder time completing it when he’s around me than I do so I guess I can manage while being around him all the time but he gets more distracted by me? 

Idk. The main point is that he’s currently at a 5 hour meeting and I miss him like crazy. I just want to cuddle him and be around him. I literally can’t stop thinking about him to the point where it’s slightly affecting my ability to do schoolwork.

He lands a really good full-time offer out of college (pay on the same level as VP + huge signing bonus) while I plan to attend grad school so most of my internship pays shit. I also have 4 jobs but they're only enough to cover my daily expenses and eating out once in a while.

At the early stage of our relationship, he's really generous with paying for dates and helping out 1-2 times I was in need. I obv couldn't lavish money on fancy dates or trips so I try my best to give him other things in return like small gifts, lots of quality time, etc. I also never ask for gifts or expect him to cover my living expenses.

I admit that he financially carries our relationship (most of our experience like restaurants and trips are paid by him) but he seems to be stricter with money recently. He sometimes imply that he spends too much and I'm part of the cost. On a recent date, he refused to get dessert with me cause he thought he had to pay for it (cheap dessert &lt;$10). He also complains how I use too much of the heat or his personal products when I sleep over.

I don't know if it's because he thinks I'm mooching or if I expect the financially well-off partner to be more generous (or not make the poor one feel uncomfortable).

i started a new wfh job around this time last year. its a small team and even though weve never seen each other in person, we do group videocalls often.

a couple of weeks later one of the girls asked me for my phone number so she could call me over work related stuff because there was something wrong with her internet connection. then she started texting me and asking personal questions and then sending me selfies, saying stuff like ""wow look at my eyebags! i'm so tired today"" and so on. I did what any other guy would do (i'm not a teenager btw, we're both in our 30s) I asked her if she wanted to go get a beer or something sometime. she instantly did a 180º and said she wasn't interested in me. I didn't take an issue with that, i'm an adult and can take a rejection just fine, I figured maybe I just misunderstood her messages.

sometime later she started sending me more selfies saying she bought new makeup and asking me if it looked good on her. this included some really dark red lipstick and in nearly all of them she was puffing her lips too, I thought maybe she changed her mind. so I asked her out again and got the same response and she stopped texting me for a while.

then later she started texting me again and I decided I wasn't going to ask her out a 3rd time and seem desperate and possibly even get in trouble at work. then she started sending me really risky pictures, saying she bought new lacy underwear (like a red corset and stuff) sending me pictures and asking me if it suited her figure and so on. well I asked her out again and got rejected.

I could keep going but you get the idea. this has happened more than 10+ times so far. after some time I stopped caring and started responding with stuff like ""I wanna cum all over those tits"" and she would reply with laughing emojis. I also replied with a dick pic once and she said it looked fat but she still refuses to go out with me. keep in mind I never initiated any of these exchanges, nope, this is all her. so what is going on here? i talked about this with a friend and he told me that maybe she is sending me those pictures to get a reaction then she is screencapping my messages and sharing them with a bf or a group chat for laughs. now I'm really worried esp considering she has my dick pics. what would you do?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1157593,public,self,exchanging intimate pictures with a coworker,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/sm9x0y/exchanging_intimate_pictures_with_a_coworker/,no_ads,0,,,,,

We had been talking about going to this like event thing at a bar for a week now and I feel so stupid for being exited. 

Before we went there he told me not to wear my mask inside. The thing is that I have PTSD from getting r*ped and the mask makes me feel safe because sometimes I get phantom sensations on my lips and right cheek. He knows about the PTSD and I told him I don't feel safe without my mask. On top of that I am trans and while I haven't actually been misgendered in many months I still feel self conscious about exposing my face fully. 

But he insisted that I don't wear my mask and he said that if I wore it I was on my own. So I said fine I would take it off but if I felt unsafe I would put it on again and he agreed. 

Oh and in the same conversation I also told him half-jokingly to not leave me alone at the bar and he said ""Do you think I an that kind of a man?"". I'm really fucking stupid.


So we get there and the loud music and the people freak me out right off the bat so I don't take off my mask. And he just proceeds to ignore me and go sit with some other people that I assume he knew from before. I say in a chair by myself and looked at my phone to kill the time and try to not literally cry. Two guys who were seating next to me asked me if I wanted to join their conversation but I was feeling really shit and said no. Then after some time I got kicked out of the bar for not ordering or doing anything and I just went home. 

20 mints after I left he texted me asking where I am and I said waiting for the trams. He replied with this stupid face 🤨 and ""Okay"".
