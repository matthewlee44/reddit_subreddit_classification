0,o77tf3,1624562050,Am I overthinking this situation or should I take it as it is and move on?," 

Hi all,

Just a little backstory: I met a girl (20) at a boba shop and got her socials/number (I am M24). The first time I ever saw her, she complimented almost everything about me; my hair, tattoos, clothing style, etc.. but I never complimented her back. I was mostly shocked because I never really got compliments from attractive women, so I didn't really think to say anything back.. But I thought she was super attractive; very cute, so I went back the next week to see if she was working, and decided to get her socials/number. From there, we really hit it off. We've only known each other for about 2 weeks now, but we've hung out 5-6 times (I'd consider them dates, even though neither of us explicitly said they were). We would go grab lunch/dinner together, go shopping, play tennis, grab boba, etc.. I'd pay sometimes, but then sometimes she'd also push me out of the way and pay other times. Recently, in the past few hangouts, we started breaking the touch barrier. Sometimes she would wrap her arm around me and like pull me out of the way of something, and then just keep it there.. We've held hands, multiple times, and we've both initiated that.

Outside of hanging out, we've been talking on Discord and watching anime/Netflix together at night, and then talking for a few hours afterwards until she goes to bed. We've done this quite a few times, but not nearly as often, maybe also 5-6 times considering how far we are in the shows. When we were texting each other, messages were exchanged within minutes.. Unless she was at work of course, then it would be whenever she was on break or got off.

Since Monday (6/21), I felt that maybe something's changed. We hung out, held hands and did all this cutesy shit. But after we parted ways, neither of us texted each other the rest of the day. Me, personally, I was wanting to see if she would initiate for once since I ALWAYS do, but she never did. We ended up not talking all of Tuesday as well. So I decided to send a good morning text on Wednesday, and she didn't respond to it until night (Sent at 9am, didn't reply until like 9pm) She responded saying something along the lines of ""sorry for replying so late, it was just one of those days lmao""

I totally understand that, as I also had a bad day yesterday getting rejected from this job I thought was in the bag. But I decided to reply an hour later, but then she never replied to that text... What confuses me is that she replies to my IG story about an hour later, but then when I reply to that, she doesn't open it. So now it's Thursday (6/24), and I haven't heard from her.. Is it safe to assume that this is probably over or am I just straight up overthinking it all? Yes, it's totally possible she's had off days and didn't feel like talking, but I would definitely feel like most people would voice that to someone. I'm probably going to let it sit for a few days, and if I don't hear from her, I'll definitely know it's over. Do people really lose interest that quickly though? Some insight would be appreciated!

I am a 32(F) that has been talking to an individual a few years younger than me for just under a month now and we have both shared our romantic interest via text with emojis and flirty exchanges (we still haven't met yet due to distance atm). This individual has quite a few obligations right now with his current career choice, and explained that upon us matching on a dating app. Even though he made a point to express his busy schedule (and I should have some idea about his current schedule at this point), I noticed that after having sent a few girlfriend-esque texts, I didn't hear back from him in a normal(ish) timeframe-I became concerned that I was scaring him off and to protect myself, I told him I felt like I was getting ahead of myself with all of the lovey stuff- and would like to start as friends and go from there.  I am not trying to sabotage the potential relationship, but realize I may have not only sabotaged it but have potentially hurt his feelings as well. At this point I haven't heard from him for a few days (which is historically abnormal), and although I want to give him space, I also want to apologize for sending him mixed messages as I do respect him, and want to continue to get to know him romantically.

My birthday was a few days ago and he asked if I wanted to grab some food to celebrate this week. I said yes and he asked if one day on my lunch break I wanted to meet. We picked today and met about 30 minutes ago. Honestly, I think it went well but I also have thought that in the past and didn't hear from them or things just fizzled out. Basically, it was a quick lunch since we both work, we only hung out for about 30-45 minutes. He greeted me with a hug and we sat down. We talked about work, the past year's craziness, and the rest of our day. The only thing is my job is much different than his and super mundane so I feel so boring when I talk about work. Like I work in a cubical alone and wait for requests to complete, it's not too glamorous. So I feel bad sharing about that aspect of myself but he seemed to understand. When the check came he paid and said he had a client he had to go meet and was already getting texts from them (I will assume it's true.) I don't want to text him because he travels all day for work so I know he's driving and busy... but I will be sitting at my desk wondering ""what did he think"" all day! Should I reach out and say we should do that again sometime? I recently went on a date and reached out after to get ignored, so I don't want to waste my time. But he was charming and we seemed to have good chemistry from what I can tell. UGH I hate being the woman in the power dynamic sometimes.

11,o796sa,1624566137,How does one build back self esteem after an abusive ex?,"I broke up with a mentally abusive ex a few years ago. Our relationship was terribly toxic. I shouldn‚Äôt have gotten into it but he really liked me at the time and I felt pressured to give him a chance. I didn‚Äôt want to miss out having a life with him because he‚Äôs treated me so well in the beginning. 

Things happened, words were said. I was also not the best girlfriend. (When we were fighting I would say terribly hurtful things to him) 
All the blaming, gaslighting and his cheating gave me a drinking problem. That lead me to gain a bunch of weight. He saw me gaining weight and told me he‚Äôs not attracted to me anymore. He wanted someone who could take care of themselves and stay fit even if they were pregnant/post pregnancy. Having struggled with body issues my whole life from my family, it really took a toll on my self worth. 

now I feel empty. Not because he‚Äôs out of my life, but empty that he took everything from me. I refuse to see other friends because I know they‚Äôll judge me for the weight I‚Äôve gained.  I haven‚Äôt taken a selfie in years because I‚Äôm scared to look at myself. I wear oversized clothes  24/7 because I don‚Äôt want people to look at my body that I‚Äôm so ashamed of.

TLDR;
I‚Äôm tired of feeling like this. I want to live a life where I don‚Äôt care about what other people think but it‚Äôs been so hard to get over this.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o796sa/how_does_one_build_back_self_esteem_after_an/

16,o79noj,1624567585,Dating the friend of a girl who rejected you?,"Months ago, I tried dating at a girl who I knew was attracted to me. I lacked confidence, and it took months for me to ask her out (she is an amployee at my gym). I finally asked her out after months of her starring at me, and she asked if we could hang out as friends but hinted at a possible date later.

Fast forward to now, I asked her out three more times as friends and she never said yes, or no for that matter, just was very ambiguous.  

I knew her friend is also attracted to me before I asked the first girl out, but I went for the first girl. Is it okay to date her friend? I have not tried to talk to the first girl in about two months and honestly do not want anything to do with her as we're probably not compatible anyways.

Is it okay to date someone's friend after they rejected you? Would you guys date someone who tried to get at your friend first knowing my context?

The first girl and I never ended up hanging out or talking very much, by the way.

17,o79o0i,1624567616,He's moving 5 hours away. Should we stop dating?,"I'm 23F and he's 26M.  We've been dating for 3 months now, but he asked me to be his girlfriend about 1 month ago. We both really like each other, and I know he feels really serious about our relationship as he's tried to get me to meet his parents already several times (I haven't been able to yet though bc of various reasons). We're also sexually active if that has anything to do with anything. Well, back in February before I met him, I got a really nice job back in my hometown. It pays well with really great benefits, and the people I'm working with are super nice. The only downside was that it was in my hometown and not in the big city (City A) in my state that I was wanting to live in. Luckily, my job has an office in City A that I can transfer to after about 2 years. 

When I met him, he was getting his masters and about to graduate and he said he was also making plans to eventually find a job in City A. Awesome. So, we start dating and things are going really well. We have an amazing emotional connection and the physical attraction is just off the charts. 

Fast forward and we're like a couple weeks out from his graduation and officially boyfriend and girlfriend and he says he's been applying for jobs and that one of the jobs he's applied for is in a different big city (City B) that's 5 hours away from me in a different state. I was a little shocked, but he said that there's no guarantee that he'll get it and that he's applied to so many other positions in City A. 

Well, fast forward some more and he's struggling though all of his final round interviews for some reason. He's left with 2 options that seem like they're both really good opportunities for him. One is a nice well-paying job in City A, and of course the other is the nice well-paying job in City B. At this point he hadn't gotten an offer from either company, but was in final round interviews where things were going well. He makes the 5 hour trip to City B for a big interview and they love him and give him an offer. A few days later he has an interview with the other position in City A and he says they really like him and that they said they were going to send him an offer in a few days. I immediately knew which offer *I* wanted him to accept (City A obviously), but I told him that that's great and they both sound like good opportunities for him. I didn't want to influence him because I'd hate myself if he made his decision based on me then ended up hating his job. Well, he decided that he wanted the City A offer, to my relief. The only issue was that it hadn't come in yet, and he had a few days left to accept the offer in City B. Of course, on that very last day that he had to accept the City B offer, City A company calls him and says that they've changed their minds. So, immediately he accepted the other offer in City B before before his time limit to accept went out. 

And now we're in the present where he just told me what happened. At this point, it's a done deal and he will be moving to City B. I'm just still shocked though. I feel like we've both been given whiplash. Everything seemed so perfect for a bit. Since he's been at college, he's been living 2 hours away from me, which has made it a struggle for us to meet up. City A is only an hour away from my hometown which would have been great, and I was planning on moving there anyway. When he told me he had gone with City B and the reasons of why it happened, he seemed upset about the situation. He alsk kept on going on about City B though and how much I'll love it there, how there's so much to do there (my main reason for wanting to live in City A), and how it's such a better place to live than City A. I basically congratulated him on the job, told him I was sorry about how things with the other company went, and agreed with him that City B is probably just as great as he's saying. I have a feeling he wants me to change my mind and decide to move to City B with him instead of City A. In fact, it's not really a feeling, on a previous date where we were talking about our futures and we were bringing up the possibility of him living in City B, he asked if I'd want to find a job in City B and move there with him. I told him that I'd just started my job and I really like it, so I didn't really know how to feel about that. He's mentioned me transferring to City A and then I'd only be 4 hours out instead of 5, but that's still a long drive and 2 years out. He's mentioned me transferring to an office my company has in a small rural town that's only 1 hour out, but again that's 2 years away from happening. Plus, I'd have to move to the middle of nowhere where I know nobody and still be an hour away from him. I just can't really see a clear path for us anymore and it's just incredibly frustrating. I'm living with my parents rn since I moved back to work in my hometown and it's the best way to save money. I basically drove 2 hours almost every weekend since we've been together to go see him since we can't hang out alone at my house. Of course, he drove to see me sometimes, but he couldn't stay for that long since he would have to drive back the same day if he drove down. Since he's moving to City B that's 5 hours away, I'm pretty sure that means I would have to be the one to drive 10 hours (there and back) on the weekends to see him. It just wouldn't make sense for him to drive to see me. Plus, I don't think I'd want to or even be able to make a 10 hour drive every weekend. That sounds like, at most, a once a month trip! I just don't see how it can work between us if that were to happen. I feel like the only way long distance like that can work is if there's a plan to eventually close the distance. The issue is that we've both just started new jobs in these cities, so of course there's not a plan to close it. We just created the distance! I'm freaking out a little because he's staying over the night with me at my house this weekend since my parents will be gone, and we're going to have to have a talk about it. I feel like we'll have to break up over this, which is the most stupid thing because we still love each other. I just don't see how it will work out though, unless I'm just missing some giant obvious solution to our problem.

Tl:dr Boyfriend got a job 5 hours away from me. I don't know if we can make a distance like that work for us if we don't have any plans of closing it. We might have to break up this weekend, and I'm very upset. Pls give advice. Thanks",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o79o0i/hes_moving_5_hours_away_should_we_stop_dating/

[27m],"So, here my story goes...For the last 8 years(since I've started dating) I've been in two long term relationship, couple situationship and countless dates. Each time I inevitably run into something with them that is a deal-breaker for me - either no initial chemistry(usually nothing goes beyond first date) or something more serious like different views on how to build a family (basically both of my LTRs ended over this). After so many attempts at finding someone with whom I could build something actually long-lasting I feel somewhat jaded and discouraged and had even become to dread any dates I plan, cause it feels so hard to find some who is compatible. Is it actually that hard, or am I being unreasonably picky? Here is what I am looking for in a potential partner :

\-Some romantic chemistry that starts to build from the start. Don't want to waste other persons time if I feel like we're just acquaintances.

\-Appearance - just be on my level. I've asked people to rate how I look, and on average it's 7/10. So obviously not a model, but someone who looks on par (healthy weight is important for me, if she is into sports - that's nice to have (since I'm into it), but not super-important.)

\-Similar values and habits in life (not religious or super-conservative, no smoking)

\-More or less on the same financial level. Not looking to be a sole breadwinner or to be with someone who can't share my lifestyle. 

\-Smart/well-read. I don't care about formal education, but if she can't hold interesting conversations on various topics - I'm out.

25,o7aa1z,1624569663,I (27M) think I want to ask out a girl (21F) who I knew as a child. But I don‚Äôt know what to do,"Basically as the title says. I‚Äôm really at a loose end at how to deal with this situation, so here goes.

When I was 17, my mother made a friend from work. She had a daughter who was 11 (and is the girl of my affections rn). Let‚Äôs call her ‚ÄúX‚Äù. My mother‚Äôs friend would come over every so often and would sometimes bring X over with her. It became quite clear that X had a crush on me. She‚Äôd always talk to me every time she was round and make pretty intense eye contact (among other things). 

My parents would tease me about it, but I didn‚Äôt really care. I didn‚Äôt take much notice of X tbh, I was more stressed about my exams and getting a girlfriend (my own age). Anyway, X would get more adventurous each time she was round. One time she‚Äôd have a gift for me, one time she‚Äôd have chalked up on her knowledge about my favourite band so she could talk to me about it. Info: she‚Äôs extremely extroverted, and I am sort of an introvert (not extremely) and shy, so she enjoyed these conversations a lot more than I did.

Anyway, my mother and her friend eventually drifted apart, and the last time I saw her she was 12. As soon as I last saw her, I pretty much forgot about her. Fast forward to a few months ago. She contacted me on social media and we chatted a bit. Tbh, I had to ask her who she was, cos she‚Äôd pretty much disappeared from my mind. She asked to meet up, and she seemed nice enough so I said yeah. I also guessed that this was 10 years ago so she probably didn‚Äôt have feelings for me anymore.

Over the last few months, we have become friends. She is charming and kind and everything you‚Äôd want in a friend. At the beginning of our friendship, she showed no sign of liking me, so our friendship progressed. However, more recently, she has shown signs of liking me. Touching, talking about us as a couple, what our children would look like if we were together, jealously when I say I‚Äôve been on a date, etc. 

This is where I‚Äôm asking for your advice. At the beginning of my friendship, I did find her attractive, but I didn‚Äôt want anything like that and she was a good friend so I put that to the back of my mind. However, over the last weeks, I‚Äôve found myself really liking her, more than in a friendly way. She‚Äôs like the perfect girl, my type, and we have really good chemistry. But, I knew her when she was a kid! So I feel a bit uncomfortable about that.

I don‚Äôt think I can carry on this friendship with these feelings, so I either want to ask her out, or sort of drift away, because it‚Äôs killing me the tension. These feelings have come on slowly and I don‚Äôt see the age gap or her as a child. But this still may be inappropriate and I don‚Äôt want to get into a relationship that could put her at risk or make people think I‚Äôm a pedo.

And every time I make some progress at that I get derailed and I suspect partly due to my willingness to be dating as much as I currently am. I think, well my dating life isn't doing terrible so I must not be doing so bad.

I'm in denial. Because I've been actively pursuing over the last 10 months and they never really stay. Maybe a few times I legit screwed up but most times there was nothing I could have done at the moment. It just was what it was, and now getting kicked to the curb for my umpteenth 3 week relationship, it's starting to become clear.

I really do think I'm a catch, like I'm really convincing myself I am when I'm not. My better qualities take up my headspace. Decently tall, nice beard, straight teeth, career, homeowner, and ability to conversate. It's all a thin veneer over who I really am.

Disorganized, overweight, likes to drink, hate talking about my feelings, not much sense of style. And they're all tied in to probably a deeper issue. Maybe depression, but who tf knows honestly. Everyone and their mother claims that whenever life isn't perfect. But my whole life I've been conflicted with being thankful for all the good things, and the other side of me thinking that life is suffering and then you die. Actually 75% of the time it's the latter. In which case, fuck it.

I can't believe I'm saying this but, I'm overconfident. I put myself out there, meet women, screw around for a few weeks, get dumped off, rinse and repeat. And this leads me to thinking I'm better than I really am. If I was so great, they'd stay. Don't get me wrong the things that I need to fix in me are fixable.

One good way to do this (and also how I‚Äôve met friends as well as some people that I‚Äôve gone on dates with) is by going to the same place repeatedly. 

For example, I would go to the same fitness class or a certain cafe weekly and I would start to notice the regulars. I will then become more comfortable introducing myself and they are probably more comfortable introducing themselves too because we‚Äôre doing this shared activity regularly!! 

Also if you think about it, that‚Äôs a reason why you see many people get together in college or from a workplace because you‚Äôre all going to this same place at the same time every week!

Also it‚Äôs great because you‚Äôll find likeminded people, people who share your same hobbies so you have that common ground already!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o7bo6v/how_to_meet_people_without_using_dating_apps/

42,o7bpk9,1624577720,I think I got ghosted‚Ä¶this one hurts more than most,"Talked to a woman on a dating app. Chemistry was there and asked for her number. We texted and planned a date night for a few days later. As we talked more during the day we said fuck it and talked on the phone.

What was planned as a few minute phone call turned into a legit 6 hour conversation about anything and everything. The only reason it stopped was I needed sleep for work the next day. As time went on we texted all day the next day. I could feel a spark for the first time in awhile. All was well.

As soon as I got off work, she told me she really wanted to hang out and couldn‚Äôt wait for date night. She asked if we could hang out, but she was house sitting so couldn‚Äôt go out. She asked me to come over. We both made it clear earlier we wanted a relationship and not a hookup. I ended up going to the house.

When I got to the house, we cuddled and watched movies. She told me she could see us becoming something and that I was handsome, charming, and sweet. We kissed, made out, laughed, and honestly she showed more interest in me that night than my last few exes combined. I ended up spending the night, no sex or fooling around but we cuddled up and fell asleep arm in arm.

Then it happened‚Ä¶everything was fine for the next day or two but the texts became less and less. When date night came she didn‚Äôt text back the whole day, then said she was running late from work. I told her to take her time and no rush. I never heard back that night and haven‚Äôt heard from her since. It hurt that she would act like date night was still on then go MIA. She still follows my snapchat stories and hasn‚Äôt blocked me on any social media.

I think I was ghosted. It‚Äôs happened before but this one is worst than most. This isn‚Äôt just a pretty face disappearing, there was a connection.

I decided it would be my goal to make dating more personal and fun. I launched an app with this goal in mind and a novel concept of only sending picture messages back and forth, kind of like snapchat. I will not promote that app here, but it did not gain much traction. I'm genuinely looking to create something of value and need some insight. How can you project who you are to others instead of just having stupid profile pictures and text messages? I came up with some ideas of my own, feel free to comment on mine and add your own.  
 

Instagram-style camera to share a story to a feed of local stories. You can see what people are up to and get a glimpse of their personalities. This could be sorted based on compatibility percentage.

People can like your story with an optional message - this allows you guys to open a conversation

Create multiple choice and open-ended questions to get a sense of user personalities (like a mix of Hinge and okCupid)

Filter potential matches based on their answers to multiple choice questions you care most about. (ex. You &amp; Amy, Maria, and Jane all answered ""love-driven"" to ""Are you more career-driven or love-driven"")

Profiles will include questions and answers. This way you can see more than just profile pictures to get a sense for whom you're matching with.

Use Open-ended Questions in profile and Multiple Choice questions for matching/compatibility percentage 

Multiple choice questions can be answered in a ""Matchmaker"" section of the app, where you see a question, choose an answer, and if you both agree, it reveals their profile and you can swipe left or right on them.

This or that questions to swipe on people (if your opinions are the same, they are swiped left otherwise right) - Reveal profile if answers match

Not just card swiping, but also a browse functionality similar to okCupid

Can send either picture message or text message after matching

so i (21F) don‚Äôt usually talk to guys and have never been in a real relationship with one, nor have i ever had a very strong desire to be in one. my friends have made jokes about it and i know it confuses them and they joke about me being asexual a lot, so sometimes i show them pictures or videos of famous guys that i consider my type. 

there‚Äôs this one guy (19M) who‚Äôs really funny online with a very large social media presence (over 250,000 followers) who makes videos that often go viral. i would watch his videos all the time and i knew from his videos that his personality is exactly the kind that i‚Äôm really attracted to. his humor is really, really bizarre and unique. my friends thought it would be funny to message him on instagram telling him that i‚Äôm basically in love with him and think he‚Äôs hilarious and sent pictures of me with my phone number telling him to text me. i thought nothing of it since i‚Äôm sure he gets messages like that all the time, but surprisingly enough, he actually ended up doing so. we‚Äôve been talking the past few days and it‚Äôs honestly so embarrassing how much i like him. like i‚Äôve never had feelings like this for guys that i‚Äôve talked to in real life. 

the thing is, i really don‚Äôt see this working out for two major reasons. 

1. he lives all the way across the country

2. he doesn‚Äôt seem nearly as interested in me as i do to him. he takes a long time to respond (like its been a little over 24 hrs since i last messaged him and still no response), yet he‚Äôs still responding to comments on his social media. 

i‚Äôm obviously not entitled to his attention and he can do whatever he wants. we‚Äôre not dating and realistically we very likely won‚Äôt be of course, but it still hurts my feelings. 

i know this is unhealthy and i shouldn‚Äôt be feeling this way over someone i barely know. i wish i had feelings this strong for someone who lived in my area but i never have. it sounds crazy since i‚Äôve never had a strong desire to be in a LTR before but i would basically do it in a heartbeat for him if he wanted to, regardless of distance.

i just want help getting over this feeling because it makes me want to cry knowing realistically nothing will happen. i just want these feelings to go away‚Ä¶ it feels like i will never find someone as interesting as him again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o7cn00/getting_over_a_person_you_were_never_even_dating/

Because if someone doesn‚Äôt want to date you, they aren‚Äôt going to change their mind because you think you are entitled for something. That‚Äôs for damn sure.

So you just have to ignore people that lie to you about what is happening to you. If there is no one out there willing to date you, the solution is not going to the gym and fine-tuning your abs. It‚Äôs not seeing a therapist and fine-tuning your mood. It‚Äôs not reading a book and fine-tuning your interpersonal skills. Apparently you are way off. And you need to be able to admit reality.

Everything you achieved is NOT enough. Obviously. You are just not what anyone wants. You can indeed be extremely successful and be completely unwanted for one reason or another. And you don‚Äôt need to necessarily be a completely terrible person for that to happen. It happens. Anyone that tells you otherwise is lying.

63,o7dsy0,1624585399,Trying to see what y'all say,"This is my first time, so be kinda ""nice"" if you would.

Background:
So I hit up a girl on Snapchat a couple of weeks ago, it goes surprisingly well. She goes to the same school as me, and she is REALLY pretty. We talk regularly(on SC, never really got around to talking in the hallways following class switch) and it gets personal for me. I try to invite her out to get snowballs, she says no 

""Ok"", I say to myself, ""that hurts"". But she plays softball, so I think that  she has practice and/or a game. My friends think it looked like I was trying to get a date, I said no I was just trying to be kind and invite her to do something. Time goes on, she stops responding to my texts. It hurt because she looks at my stories but doesn't reply to my texts. My parents say just forget about her, but it's really hard to.

Question is:
Did I spook her from ever trying to talk to me? Should I just stop talking to her?

72,o7ej8z,1624588208,I am 31 years old and I need life advice.,"I am writing this post to seek advice, guidance, and emotional support on an obvious issue that I can longer ignore, which is that I am 31 years old and I have never had a girlfriend. I am of East Indian descent; however, I grew up in California. I have been told that numerous times that I am good looking guy, and some people are even shocked to find that I have never had a girlfriend before. Throughout much of my adult life, I have been overlooked by girls. I have seen Indian guys score girls, yet I would be left with nothing and it often make me think just ""What exactly is it about these guys that make them particularly appealing?"" ""What exactly do these guys have that I do not?"" I have a fair complexion for an Indian so I am quite often told that I do not ""look Indian"" but rather a hispanic or middle eastern, which irritates me. I am very insecure about my figure, as I believe that it is the sole reason that people have never respected me- I am 5'8"" with a slender build, which makes me look a lot younger than my actual age; I could easily pass for 22. Many of these Indian guys may be taller than me-6'1"", however, they are not exactly the most refined of people- they are very callous and rude. Many times, where girls have expressed interest in me, there has always been some jealous male that has ruined it for me. I have tried using dating sites, such as Tinder, and much to my chagrin, I have never matched even once in the past two years that I have been using the app. For a while, I stopped caring by reassuring myself that I can life without a girlfriend, but unfortunately, I am reaching an age where I need to find someone. 

I ought to mention that I would prefer to date a girl outside of my ethnicity. I must profess that anytime I see a brown guy with a white girl, I become infuriated with jealousy because I often think that if that brown guy can score a white girl, why can't I? What exactly does that brown guy have that I don't? I wouldn't feel the same way if the guy were White, Yellow, or Black, but only Brown. 

One could contend that there may be something about myself that I could change, and I completely agree; however, one attribute about physique that I have not been able to change is my height, and I know that women do care about that- they are lying if they tell you that it is not important. Consequently, I am strongly considering undergoing cosmetic limb lengthening surgery, which would essentially make me 5 inches taller, and put me at 6'1"", and not to mention people wouldn't bully me and women would be more likely to express interest in me. 

If I were a brown guy standing at 6'1"" and not 5'8"", I would be respected and not bullied as much as I have throughout my life. I am constantly told by women that I look like a little boy and not like a grown man and that is simply because of my small build. 

It is my misfortune to have been dealt with a very bad genetic hand at birth; however, I do plan to redeem by making myself taller to improve the quality of my life and ultimately ensure my happiness.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o7ej8z/i_am_31_years_old_and_i_need_life_advice/

77,o7f8iz,1624590769,I Need Strategies To Combat The Negative Thoughts In My Head Telling Me I‚Äôm Incapable Of Dating,"First, stuff about me to get an idea of who I am. Strictly on the physical level, I‚Äôm about to turn 23 in a couple of months, 5‚Äô8, Vietnamese, 130 pounds, straight black hair, brown skin, glasses, the whole works. I posted my pics on r/amiugly and I was told that my style of clothing is genuinely nice and multiple constructive critiques told me to simply work out and buff my muscles. I‚Äôm doing that every other day. 

Personality-wise, and I understand that my personality is subjective depending on who‚Äôs interacting with me: I‚Äôm an introvert-until-I-open-up, funny, intelligent, introspective, I remember minute details about friends, hard-working, creative, and proactive. 

I feel like I identified my weaknesses which directly impacted my dating inexperience: I was a people pleaser, a pushover, a doormat, subservient, timid, spineless, awkward, passive, insecure. These traits all go hand in hand to say that I‚Äôm a man who WAS needy. I‚Äôm re-reading ‚ÄúModels‚Äù by Mark Manson and he made it clear that neediness is a turn-off for people, especially needy men for women in this context. I‚Äôm in therapy, on meds, I‚Äôm journaling, and I‚Äôm reading self-help all as ways to focus on myself. 

I say I ‚ÄúWas‚Äù these things because of my other problem: I haven‚Äôt interacted 1-on-1 IRL with a girl since May 2019. I graduated from university in June 2019 and worked remotely from then and up to now (obviously the pandemic exacerbated things.) All my IRL socializing friends are guys, not counting a few of their girlfriends, and that‚Äôs that. I haven‚Äôt had any interactions with girls so it‚Äôs a no-brainer why I squandered, like, 9% of my life that I could‚Äôve spent gaining experience with the opposite sex. 

When it comes to girls and dating, I am a virgin who‚Äôs never held hands, obtained a phone number, or kissed a girl. It doesn‚Äôt bother me day-to-day but it does peeve me when I stay up at night, unable to sleep, and I consider all the potential time I could‚Äôve had in a relationship or at least seeing a girl that I squandered while other men my age are fulfilling their desires due to their competence in this department. 

Now that you know all that, I‚Äôll explain the purpose of this post. I have to actively choose each day to tackle life with a positive attitude and shackle my negativity in my brain to keep it from ruining my day. I don‚Äôt believe it can ever be cured but my willpower can keep it at bay. 

However, I‚Äôm here asking for strategies to better combat the negative thoughts I have that tell me I am never going to date or have a relationship. This is due to these thoughts using hard facts and data as evidence to back up the idea that I‚Äôll stay lonely forever. In other words, common knowledge that is present all over the internet supports the negative chunk of my brain and gives it a stronger voice in my head. 

I‚Äôm talking about the following: Asian men have it hardest on dating apps by a large margin. No one can argue with that. Western media emasculates Asian American men to feminize them which is subconsciously in the mind of many women. Darker-skinned men experience less dating success on the online landscape. So do short men, and so do men with lesser amounts of strength. So combined, as a shorter, darker-skinned, scrawnier Asian American man, these facts that are mostly (besides physical strength) unchangeable ruin my day. 
 
Also, adult virgins into their 20s face a lot of rejection that snowballs into longer-lasting rejection due to their inexperience, the reluctance to be an older person‚Äôs first, and the preference to sleep with someone who knows what they are doing. These sensible reasons make me feel like I have less hope than others due to my celibacy. As if that‚Äôs not enough, it‚Äôs exponentially worse since I‚Äôve never kissed a girl. I don‚Äôt know any girl my age who‚Äôs willing to walk a grown man through the motions of basic relationship/intimacy that a high-school boy can be well-versed in. 

So I improve myself and I mentally reinforce my willpower to push through so as to better my life. I keep moving forward. But it‚Äôs these soul-crushing flaws that are able to break me down and make me think that all my efforts are for nothing. Like, it makes me think I‚Äôll never meet a woman who‚Äôll tolerate AND be enthused to go out and connect with a 5‚Äô8, skinny, brown, Asian virgin who‚Äôs never kissed a girl at nearly 23. 
 
So to anybody who reads this: Thank you. And I have some questions to ask. 

How can I fight against these depressing thoughts in my head? 

How do you do it? 

Is it worth it for me in my specific situation to work hard to beat my odds or am I just a bit too unlucky?

Are my negative thoughts valid to some degree?

85,o7fub7,1624593224,What is my problem - am I ugly or not romantic?,"Hey everyone, so here‚Äôs my little story.

I ended a relationship this January of about 4 years. I started online dating again in February and it has been a disaster.

I was able to match with a average amount of girls on Tinder and slim on Bumble. I went to Hinge and thats where it started blowing up oddly enough. My friends and coworkers usually have better luck with Tinder/Bumble.

Now to the point - a girl I recently went out with whom I texted for about two weeks told me over text she felt no ‚Äúfirst date gitters or a spark‚Äù and that midway thru the date she saw me as a friend. She stated there was no excitement, attraction, or drive to want intimacy. She offered to be friends and said I would be an amazing boyfriend, she just didn‚Äôt feel it that way. 

She knew what I looked like, we often would snap as well so she knew my face. She told me she knew I was slimmer when I asked if she thought I was chubby based on a comment she made on preferring men with a softer abdomen.

I‚Äôve only had one girl this year call me ugly, and it was a friends girl‚Äôs friend he was talking to from Tinder. I did other dates and it didn‚Äôt workout due to ‚Äúchemistry‚Äù as well. They still follow me on social media and like my posts, one of them I myself felt nothing for and I was exhausted from hearing her talk.

The first girl I met in February saw me a second time, but it became toxic real quick and she ghosted me.

I believe in learning from every experience but if I‚Äôm ugly there‚Äôs nothing to learn from‚Ä¶ I already maintain my hygiene overly well, I have a slim athletic body, I get nice haircuts. So I don‚Äôt get it.

One friend of mine said I lost my game from breaking up a half year ago, even though my ex moved on and found someone new. One friend told me to stop listening to that first friend and to start actually talking on a intimate level. I used to have deep conversations with girls and look at them on a personal level in the eyes, I used to be serious more, now I just have fun and my second friend said its like I‚Äôm just trying to hangout, rather than date.

I know myself and I know I‚Äôm no Ryan Reynolds or 9/10, but I‚Äôm not bottom of the barrel to call it. The past girls I dated or had a relationship with have all been bbws, and now I have tried to see skinnier girls or ‚Äúchubby‚Äù even.

Since the pandemic I‚Äôve been growing my hair.  It‚Äôs currently shoulder length and a bit wavy and I really like it. (If you click on my profile there is a picture for reference).  I think I‚Äôm going to keep growing it longer and eventually donate it to locks of love or something like that but I know it has to get pretty long.  Since I was younger I‚Äôve always wanted to have it to waist length or tailbone length. 
I guess I‚Äôm just curious as to what you ladies would think about hair that long if it was tamed and taken care of.  I do want to make it clear that I personally enjoy my hair and nobody here is going to change my opinion on it so feel free to give your honest opinion!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o7h4l9/ladies_would_you_date_a_guy_with_really_long_hair/

96,o7h7py,1624598781,Breakup: I believe love doesn‚Äôt exist nor will ever happen for me,"After 10 years of dating I (28F) thought I finally found the one. We met unexpectedly at a friends wedding, he asked me to be his girlfriend in a week, we both agreed that finding each other was meant to be, ‚Äúwhen you know you know‚Äù. We were everything we both were looking for and wanted, the timing was right, we had everything in common. He said I love you early on and we said it every day. Things were going great, I met his family 2 weeks ago. His mom said I made him so shoot and hugged me! I met both his kids twice, he was always giving and kind and said I was the best person that came into his life as I said/did the same. I thought wow, I finally found the love of my life. 

He got a bit quieter since meeting his family, but still called and texted daily. I just visited him and he was being slightly distant but not a whole lot. I asked him what was wrong and he said he has been stressed but didn‚Äôt want to talk much. He said he was stressing about ex/kid/legal stuff, work stuff, money issues. I got more concerned and was trying to be supportive but he wasn‚Äôt giving me much info at all. I was having anxiety and asked him to call. He started to blow up at me and then said he needed space and hung out on me. I texted and called and was confused. He sent me another vague message that he needed space and don‚Äôt want to talk. This gave me more anxiety so I texted and called more freaking out. He stopped reading my messages. I started to get into hyperventilating and panic attack. I told him I wasn‚Äôt okay and needed him, he said nothing. I got 3 hours of sleep. I sent him a text at 11:30am that was kind and understanding but asked him to please reach out because I was worried. Overall he didn‚Äôt answer for 18 hours since last night. Hours later he calls, he says nothing except I made things worse and he needs to be alone right now. I told him that I almost went to the hospital for passing out from hyperventilating and he said nothing. I cried and pleaded that we could have a middle ground and find a solution. He hung up. 

I truly don‚Äôt understand how people can be so heartless. Everything was going great. I feel there‚Äôs more he didn‚Äôt tell me and kept hidden. I feel he was no different than any jerk. He manipulated and used me. Dropped me off like garbage. I‚Äôm so devastated, I feel completely heart broken. He already changed his FB relationship status, deleted me off Xbox and Snapchat. I feel he lied about everything idk what was even true or real. He also owes me $525 for a TV he picked up for me to Mount and he won‚Äôt reply to my messages, that fraud it‚Äôs not his money! How can people do this?? I truly don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôll find love or can trust.

98,o7hc2b,1624599302,would i be moving too fast if i asked her to be my girlfriend? **NSFW**,"Hey everyone, i wanted to get some of your opinions on if i should ask this girl from work to be my girlfriend. shes dope. im 20, and shes 23. 

here‚Äôs the story:

as of the past two weeks, I‚Äôve been hanging out with this beautiful girl from work. We started talking 2 weeks ago because i overheard a coworker say she thought i was attractive, and since i already interested in her for her looks, i went and asked for her number after having a handful of flirty conversations. she didnt give me her number, but she gave me her instagram and we followed each other. thought i got rejected but boy was i wrong. 


fast forward 3 days, ( keep in mind we‚Äôve been talking and flirting at work each day on our hour long breaks ) she offers to drive me home. we have great deep conversations on this ride about our experiences at work. she asked about the videography business i run, and i told her stories about some of my experiences on set. she seemed very interested in my life and my past. 



2 days later, she asks me to go on a run with her to target. i went, cause i thought this was her way of shooting her shot with me. it totally was, as after the run we made plans to go to the movies before we parted ways. but while we were in the car, someone called her; and now shes driving me home instead of the movies. she said she‚Äôd reschedule. 

thought i got stood up, but when she got to the house; she saw my cat in my window.


she loves cats. so she asked if she could come inside and pet her. 

shes comes in my living room, and starts playing with the cats. at this point i went and got her a water, and then before you know it she asked for a tour of my house after a few minutes with the cat. 

once we got to my bedroom/work studio part of the tour, she jumped on the bed and turned on the tv. i asked her what she was doing, and she said she canceled her plans to go party in manhattan for me ( we are based in NYC ) 
and that we should watch a movie. i was hype. 

anyway, fast forward later night, we cuddled and touched each other ( consensual of course ); but we didnt make out because she said she only feels comfortable kissing someone she loves. 

we had a deep convo about our feelings and our intentions for each other, and were completely transparent with one another. i love that about us, water couldnt be more transparent. its weird to me because initially she didnt want to tell me anything. 

fast forward the next 3 days, we‚Äôve hung out every day after work and on our meals at work. we‚Äôre very fond of each other, and we‚Äôve teased each other a whole bunch. there was a ton of built up sexual tension between us. 
anyway, after we hung out i even let her tag along for my long video editing sessions after my day job. she loves back seat editing lol. 

after 2 hours though, she pulled me out of my work chair and pulled me onto the bed. she started kissing my cheek and told me i should lay down with her and take a break. i listened and we cuddled and watched scary movies until 3 in the morning. during this, she started touching me and i returned the favor. she also asked how many girls ive been with in this time, and asked alot about my love life. we bonded over our past traumatic relationships. 

she also met my sister , who lives with me. my sister told me that she asked alot about me when they spoke. 

the next day, i was up late working hard to finish a project because the deadline for a client was approaching. she came over that night and supported me the whole night, making food with me, making sure i ate, stayed hydrated, and happy. we watched movies while i edited, and then after i was finished we layed down together. at this point, we both wanted each other so bad, and got down to business. we had sex for the next hour, and she spent the night until she had a shift in the morning. she went on and on about how great my head game was, and i thought it was hilarious because that was my first time ever eating a girl out. the sex was amazing, passionate, and rough. better than anything ive ever experienced with my exes. she felt similar, as she told me that when i walked her to her car in the morning. she kissed me goodbye, and i contemplated what she said about ‚Äúkissing someone you love‚Äù. 

we had raw sex, and so, she was obviously nervous about pregnancy since she was ovulating. i personally knew i didnt cum inside her, however i wasnt taking any chances and she was nervous, i wanted to put her at ease since i care for her so dearly already. so i sent her 50$ without hesitation. she said that was a test to see the type of man i really am, and i passed. she kisses me again at this point.  

she calls me while shes at work to tell me shes getting birth control, which i found amusing. 

2 days later, she comes over again after work. we go straight to the bedroom, and have 3 back to back rounds of passionate sex. at this point, we‚Äôre being extremely rough with each other in the bedroom. shes leaving cuts on my back, and im leaving hickies on her breasts. i should also note that we‚Äôre now kissing regularly this time around. making out passionately every chance the sex position offered the opportunity. she spends the night once again, and she wakes up early in the morning to me working on a project while on the phone with another client. she kisses me and swears i‚Äôl make it because of my killer work ethic. i muted the phone, waited for her to leave the room; and nearly teared up because she made me so happy. 

she made me breakfast, and then we went to the gym together since it was both our days off from work. i gave her the best workout of her life at the gym, and i power lifted the whole time to impress her. it worked, as we had shower sex when we got home LOL. 

she went home this day because she felt sick, i took care of her the best i could. when i walked her to her car that day, she seemed upset and didnt want to kiss me goodbye. i was fine with this however, and just told her that if she needed to talk that i was always there for her; and that she can confide in me. she told me shes not ready to open up about this issue yet. i told her thats fine, take your time, and then kissed her on the forehead and sent her off. 

she calls me hours later on instagram, ( because for whatever reason, she still doesnt want to give me her phone number..? even though we‚Äôve had sex so many times? i dont get it, but i respect boundaries so if this is one shes set for me for now, im fine with that )

on this call she tells me im not over my ex, because i spoke about her alot the day prior. i could tell thats why she was upset. i understood, and put my heart on my sleeve for her. ( i was in an all around abusive 6 year relationship, and while it was terrible its made me a stronger man mentally and emotionally. ) and i explained that to her. i told her the only reason why i bring my ex up, is because that relationship turned me into the strong and transparent person i am today. she told me to put my ex in my past and focus on her, and i giggled. we talked on the instagram video call for the next 3 hours, and then she hung up abruptly. i texted her to see if she was okay, but she didnt answer until the next day. 

at this point, ( the end of the second week) we‚Äôve hung out every day this week. ( i must highlight that we‚Äôve been having sex every day this week, 2-5 times a day. )
however yesterday she went through my phone and found old texts with a girl i spoke to a month prior. it was nothing nearly as serious as what i feel for this girl, and i was actually planning on putting the other girl down easy. she was upset initially but i told her if she wants to be exclusive with me she can be. she giggled. we went on to cuddle, but she went through my phone again when i went to go make her something to eat, and she said i must be hiding something. i let her go through my phone even though it gave me so much anxiety ( mainly because nobody but me is allowed on my phone, so i never delete any messages ever with anybody unless im on bad terms with them ). she went through for 45 minutes. she found alot of diary entries in my notes, and asked for permission to read them. i told her my thoughts are yours, and some of the things she read made her cry. she went on to kiss me and we cuddled for the rest of the night until she had to leave for work at 4am. 

now the final day (today): she came over after work and watched me edit again. she stayed over the whole day, and we spent it editing, making love, and watching scary movies. she made alot of jokes about me being her girlfriend. i tried to go through her and unlock it on her face id as a joke since she went through mine, and she unlocked it right away and gave it to me. she said she doesnt delete messages either, and that i‚Äôl be upset about the things shes said to other guys in the past. 

i told her i believed her, and that it was just a joke. i kind of wanted to look through it to see if it was a lie and if she was talking to other guys, but i thought about the fact that we are not actually together and that thats kind of a toxic behavior ( even though she did it to me ) so i chose not to. 

she also came over today from 11am and left at 10pm by the way. 

at this point now that you guys are up to speed, i want to know what some of you think. i did keep out some things like the specifics of our deep conversations, but they trust that they were very thoughtful and heartfelt conversations. 

do you think i should ask her to be my girlfriend? i feel like me and her click so well, and we‚Äôre both very transparent about our feelings which i love. since shes older than me shes so mature, and im quite mature for my age so i feel like we match up nicely in that department. our sex is fantastic, we both finish every single time. i honestly work like an open book for her, so i know im not questioning anything on my end. i want her to be mine. however, she still hasnt given me her number yet. i feel like thats fishy. like, we‚Äôve been having sex multiple times every day for a week. how can i not get your number still? i dont know. 
she also seems to love to test me, meaning test my interest in her, my morals (evident in the plan b thing ), and how loyal im willing to be. id be lying if these tests didnt strike anxiety into me, as i feel like i could lose her if i mess up. but the reward is so fantastic that i love it haha.
