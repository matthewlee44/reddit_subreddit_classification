It doesn‚Äôt make you feel wanted, it would be like I can‚Äôt ask you to marry me until we have dated for 5-10 years or something. Just seems regimented when love is supposed to be letting of the guard down.

6,pp9y0o,1631784572,How do you approach people who are set in life/ older?,"I have become quite an aged character - there are many interested people around, but they are usually way too young for me. I am not a 20-something - I want someone who wants to stay around. Actually, that's also what I wanted when I was a 20-something, but that is another story for another time.

Anyway - set people usually want certain list items crossed off, because they assume, that it will keep them safe from 'wasting time'. I can understand that wish very much, because I see the time up to know as wasted, too, because I always pursued these long-time, deep connection things, but still chose wrongly several times. 

I never got chosen, too - by people my level, that is. I only ever get chosen by way younger, inexperienced people, who clearly go for my looks (I might be recognized in a crowd a little better than others) and with with a connection probably will not endure for longer than some weeks, months or at the most some years, until the next, better fling comes along.

I am not afraid to do the work and regularly engage in contact, (logically understandable rejections) or not. Logically and understandable rejections, because attractive people my age are usually married with kids, or divorced with kids.  So the 'good' people are gone anyway. I know what that makes me. It still does not solve the problem though.

Is there anyone out there, who succeeded in solving this issue or who has a better approach then the 'usual' ones?

I go into various working out sessions at different locations, where people are to be found, I work in a job that constantly confronts me with new faces and new people and that is highly positively connotated and I spend a lot of time alone. I keep working at myself (also physically - gym 5-6 times a week, always with a ton of others, approaching my own license), go to therapy two times a week (because something must be wrong?), I am extremely ambitious (working on my third and fourth degrees), I cook and I clean everything myself (and I do not intend to ever change that).

I have a crazy family, but that is just how it is. I cannot advertise them as others can, because, well, they are really bad and egocentric people. I never get to the point though, that it might become an issue to explain, how I will not ever want to engage with them beyond the necessary formality. 

I am ageing and ageing - supposed to be in the 'prime of my life', but I am very much single and often lonely. I have many friends I could spend time with and I sometimes do, but it is not the same as a partner. I am neither brilliant, rich, nor famous. But neither are the people I'd like to date. I would, of course, but that would probably make me shallow by default. 

Anyway, I really must find a new approach, because whatever I do does not work. 

And yes, I also know, how clothing works and I am that little bit nervous and/or bubbly when I am interested. I also have my devils, as everyone has (mine is migraines, but that never comes up anyway, because I am good at integrating problems into a somehow working environment) so nothing unusual.

Also, I am (still) trying tinder (fifth time, using half-professional fotos with proven track record, proven and normal text describing what I am actually into). I swipe around 2000-3000 profiles per week (starting to know the standard lines everyone copies \[stop copying your profile text!\] by heart and being really inclusive, as long as someone is not crazy, an addict of some sort, not interested in university and learning. I've had some 'dates', but it was all with people who blatantly lied about their actual life and many more just ghosted before anything happened. I only unmatch with a waiting period of 2 weeks. ) 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone?

TLDR: Dumb guy eats bread, gets fat, end of story. See? I am funny. At least I know how to copy funny quotes. Anyway: I'm trying to find a new approach/way/idea in finding a good partner. It's not that 1-2-3 twenty-something-I like your looks and I want to marry you- thing. That ship has sailed. i guess I fulfill whatever one possibly could want in another human being of my age.

15,ppapnf,1631788355,"[F22] I practice being open about my feelings, but I feel he (M22) teases me about it. I also don't get the answers I'm looking for.","I am a little frustrated over my dating situation and need a place to vent, since all my friends are at work or in school now.

I (F22) have been seeing this guy (M22) for 1,5 months now.

From the beginning, I've made it clear that I am looking for a boyfriend and asked him to be transparent as I have had my single life and, before meeting him, I spent a long time with a guy who in the end did not know what he wanted. I made it clear several times, and he was onboard and told me he was also looking for a girlfriend. He deleted tinder after first date and was quite vocal about his interest. I was a little unsure about him in the beginning, but grew fond of him, and we were officially exclusive after a few weeks. He got out of a long (5 years) relationship last year and is also done with casually dating.

I feel our communication is a bit off sometimes. He doesn't.

The current problem is that I have been giving out many suggestions that I like him. For instance, two weeks ago, I told him that I was starting to feel something for him and told him that while I did not expect us to become gf and bf right away or get married tomorrow, I would like him to let me know if he did not see us becoming a couple at some time, because then, I would look after myself. His reply was ""So I only have to say something if that is the case?"". I was a bit too vulnerable to deal with his games and just said yes. Silence followed, and he asked ""Was that answer enough?"". And I said yes. But it was not. I would like a clearer response on what he might feel about us/me. He afterwards said ""You should not have to worry about me hurting you. Did you really not think I wanted to be with you like that (as gf/bf)?"", but still not saying that he would like to, at some point, directly. So I decided to trust him on it instead of being unsure, but other problems arose (see further down) that made it difficult to not worry.

Also, he tends to tease me about these emotional talks. Afterwards, he said, ""wow, you really looked like you were having an existential crisis there"", to which I replied ""well, yeah, I was in a vulnerable situation"".

Another thing is that he has willingly met many of my friends and school buddies and refer to them as if they were our mutual friends. But I haven't met any of his. He did once suggest we went for a beer with his friends, which I accepted, but we ended up staying at home instead. I was looking forward to it, though. A friend of mine pointed out that people have different needs when it comes to meeting friends. For me, it is important that the person I am seeing meets my friends, but I think she is right in that it is not like that for everyone.

We are however very affectionate in public and have been so almost since the beginning. We run into lots of his colleagues and his students, and he never lets go of my hand whilst saying hello to them. We also ran into his mom sometime, but we had just gotten out, so we were not holding hands yet.

And he has let me know that his friends ""like my memes"" and they know we're dating. Another example is that my mom asked about him on the phone while he was here, and afterwards he kept repeating ""ooh, it sounds like your mom knows who I am"". Altogether, it is not a fun tease anymore. So I replied ""Yeah, I was dating a guy for 4 months and we we're quite serious and travelling together etc, so it is natural that my closest family knew about him. When we ended things, she asked me how I was, and I mentioned I was dating you, but I would not usually bring up a guy after just 1,5 months"". The latter is not entirely true, but I was a bit fed up with his teasing. I told him that my mom had invited him to our family dinner, but that I had not told him because I figured it was too early. Again, he did not really answer.

The teasing hurts because I have been scared of being clingy in the past, so I was very reserved and not emotional, which often meant that I pushed guys away. I am trying hard to be open about my feelings and needs, but all I get is this in return.

The last thing is that he has some physical issues that means that we have not been able to have sex yet. We both really want to. He has been very open about this and gone to the doctor, which I really appreciated. Pulling back the foreskin feels uncomfortable, and his doctor advised him to just suck it up and get used to it slowly. He felt his doctor did not understand the problem. I am trying to be supportive, to listen, and not be inflicting in a topic that is most likely very sensitive to him, but I would also just like him to consult another doctor and try to suggest that it may be tight foreskin.

Yesterday, we tried again.

He kept saying that he felt bad for making me wait on him getting used to the uncomfortable feeling and was scared that I might end up being irritated for having ""practiced"" eg 30 times (his words) and still not getting anything out of it. I told him that I was mature enough to make that judgement myself and that, as I had told him before, was willing to wait for him. He gave me a big smile and kissed me. But then he kept repeating the same things, and I tried to ask several times if what he really meant was that *he* was not willing to wait? He just repeated his insecurities and said that he would really like it to work and us to be together in that way too. Now I remember that he did also quietly mention that he was not sure if it was ever gonna work, though. And then he suggested that maybe our bodies just don't fit together. That hurt in some way. I said something in the lines of that I like him and think we fit together in other ways, so I would be sad if that was gonna be what ended things. I've been spending the last couple of hours thinking about what made me sad and writing this, I guess what he said makes it sound like we're getting closer to the end already. Like he's already given up on it.

He repeated the thing about letting me wait for it, and again, I said that that was my decision to make, but that the only thing I may worry about is if I end up falling in love with him and then we have to end things because of this ... I think I was expecting a reply, but he did not say anything, so I just continued that I guess it was something we'd have to take along the way, and I'd have to say stop if it became too much. To which he replied, ""Just promise me you *will* say stop then"". Which I guess is a way of respecting my feelings, but it just hit differently. I don't know why, but I was kind of hoping that he would reply with something else, and not just ""ok, but *do* say stop if so"", because it sounds like he's not as emotionally invested as I had hoped for. Idk.

I know 1,5 months in is early, but we've been quite open and close from the beginning. Last week, we saw each other 5 days, and on 3 of them, I was sick, and he came all the way to just take care of me. And we talk everyday.

The post is very long, I know, but any advice or comments are welcome. I am tired of ""fishing"" for his responses on how he may feel about me, but I also think I have been quite direct so many times, that it would scare him off if I keep mentioning how I feel about him.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ppapnf/f22_i_practice_being_open_about_my_feelings_but_i/

I (28 F) went on a date on Friday night with this guy (35) and thought it went really well! Had some drinks, walked around, spent 4 hours babbling and finished the date with a quick little smooch at my car. We had a quick post-date conversation over text during which he mentioned grabbing food ‚Äúnext time‚Äù because we both got home hungry and tipsy.
However, he then didn‚Äôt speak to me in a couple days so I reached out to ask about his weekend plans -he‚Äôs going out of town but there were complications I was wondering if he got resolved. He answered 10 hours later but sent a paragraph and kept the conversation going by asking me about a movie that reminded him of me. I replied quickly, thinking he was going to try to make plans to watch it together, but it‚Äôs been silent since then ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

A) he will be gone this weekend and then a week later leaving for 10 days and I‚Äôm gone the weekend he gets back.. so he may find it useless to chat so far in advance.
B) Im an idiot and told him I am trying to stay home on weeknights except now I want to change my mind obviously since I want to see him!

And most ‚Äúgame‚Äù really only works if you‚Äôre attractive. Like I have a lot of girl friends and I have no issues talking to women and getting them to like me but that won‚Äôt make them attracted to me.

And I know people are going to say that a good looking guy with a shit personality can‚Äôt get that far. Which admittedly is true, but a hot guy that‚Äôs a douche can easily get laid and I can‚Äôt even get a date because I‚Äôm ugly.

25,ppcjlo,1631796081,I feel like as a guy put so much effort into dating with little in return from the women I go on date,"I feel like that I‚Äôm the one that has to make things happen as a man. I‚Äôm constantly putting in 95% of effort and the girls I end up seeing give like 5%.

I‚Äôm the one that has to risk rejection and embarrassment and being a social pariah by asking a girl out. I‚Äôm the one that has to plan the date and I‚Äôm the one that has to pay.

And okay, I get it. This is how it works as a man these are things that if I don‚Äôt do I‚Äôm going to die alone. Whatever cool.

But then passed that I‚Äôm still putting in all the effort and getting nothing but the gift that is her presence. And I‚Äôm still buy meals and gifts and flowers for her, I‚Äôm still the one thats essentially putting on a performance just for her to sit there and look pretty.

Maybe we have sex but that‚Äôs really it. Other than that she‚Äôs just there. Even if I genuinely like the girl it‚Äôs hard to feel like I get anything out of dating women.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ppcjlo/i_feel_like_as_a_guy_put_so_much_effort_into/
26,ppclo5,1631796313,No flirting? Friendzone?,"So I've been speaking to this guy I met online for over 2 weeks now, and we've been on 1 date in that time due to other things cropping up. We've been getting to know each other loads, chat is great and we've shared so much. Really getting to know each other well. 

However, I've not really experienced any flirting, which to me is out of the ordinary as I've always found there was flirting with any of the guys I've talked to, and there's always some form of initiative. 

In hindsight, he is really sweet, always asks how I am and we're always talking. But now this makes me question if I am in the friend zone!?

He's called me gorgeous and things like that and has given compliments about my music taste, but when I try to show initiative or a compliment, or a flirty comment, he doesn't really reciprocate and plays it off in a funny way. 

Recently, he made a comment about how his big hands aren't always great for things, and I said something about big hands are good for other things. Although I found his response funny, which was ""Fantastic for holding multiple cups at once, you're right"", I'm not sure how to take this? 

We won't go on a date for over a week due to covid, so I'm not sure if he's not ready for that or if I'm just barking up the wrong tree ahha. He has definitely shown interest in seeing each other again. 

TL;DR Have been seeing a guy for over 2 weeks and there's barely any flirting but loads of texting and getting to know each other. Can't tell if it's just friendly or he likes me as more than a friend",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ppclo5/no_flirting_friendzone/

I was 15 when we meet in the park. We got pretty close but then things began to be weird.
She always gave me hope and took it back. She would get angry at me for no reason (she once starded to crie out of no where and began to laugh as i was visibly concerned for her. She told me that she did that because ,,i am funny when i am sad,,).
She treaded me like shit and every time i wanted to take a break, she would call me ""uncaring"" or ""a bad person"".
I lost touch whit my friends because i would always go out whit here only to be her emotional punching bag.
A year ago (19 yo) she told me that he did all of those only because she loved to see me suffer for her and ,,the best thing is that you will always come back like a dog, no matter what i do to you"". She told me that i wasn't even her friend, but a plaything for when she was bored.
Hearing this made me feel sick in my stomach, i deletet her on all social media and i never got out whit her since, even if she tried to make me feel bad aboud ghosting her.
Now, because of her, my self esteem is shit and i am scared of women, even if the warmth and love of a woman is what i crave the most.
Even when they hit on me i usually sabotage myself.
I hate myself and every day is unbearable pain since.

33,ppdk3z,1631799793,First real ‚Äúdate‚Äù in awhile.,"I don‚Äôt really have anyone to tell this to, so reddit it is, but yesterday was the first ‚Äúdate‚Äù I had in awhile and it felt amazing. 

I‚Äôm 21 M and in college, and over a year ago I had gotten out of a 3 year long distance relationship. There were a few different dates between then from dating apps, but the connection was NEVER there so I stopped pursuing. Especially since we were in a pandemic and most people just staying at home, I just focused on myself.

I‚Äôm naturally an introvert, so as a result of that I don‚Äôt have many friends, only 1 guy friend. College just started and I‚Äôve been forcing myself to step out of my boundaries and approach people. Whether its complimenting another dude‚Äôs shoes or a random persons hair, I‚Äôm just forcing myself to speak to people and if the conversation developes, we go from there. I ended up speaking to a girl after one of my classes last week, just to speak about how she feels about the course. She seemed excited to talk to me, and it seemed like she was in the same exact boat as me; that being no friends but trying to step out of boundaries. 

We swapped numbers. The next day after my classes I messaged her to see if she was free, she was. We grabbed some coffee. Now this was just something casual, so I wouldn‚Äôt count it as a date at all. If it matters at all, I paid for our coffees, since I had asked her to meet me. When we grabbed coffee she mentioned she was vegan, and also stated that she would be willing to try my favorite food restaurant with me.


After my 1-2:20pm class yesterday, I had a gap until my 6pm-9pm class. I asked her through text if she wanted to grab lunch, and since she‚Äôd be willing to try non-vegan food, I wanted to try vegan food. We met up around 3pm and I drove her to the vegan place about 30 mins away. Everything was good, vibes were good, but the initial barrier of discomfort/unfamiliarity was still there. Around 5:00pm we pulled back into my campus‚Äôs parking lot, since she dorms her building was close to the parking garage too. Something happened between 5pm-6pm, we became VERY relaxed with each other. The comfort barrier was broken, and we stayed in the car talking to each other for hours. Basically I ended up skipping my class. We stayed in the parking garage until 11pm. It started raining pretty hard so I dropped her back off at her dorm. So by the end of the day, she was back in her dorm by 11:30pm. 

Now, I know when I asked her to get lunch with me, I didn‚Äôt specify it to be a date, so thats why I put date in quotes. Also why I didn‚Äôt try anything like kissing her. But before she returned to her dorm, we made plans to meet this weekend and to go on my motorcycle for a ride, (I only mention this because in my opinion it‚Äôs more intimate?) I specified it to be an actual date, and she was visibly happy when I mentioned it.

Maybe I‚Äôm just too happy after what happened yesterday, but the connection was just there. She shared so many similar beliefs and interests. Just wanted to be able to tell this to someone.

But I‚Äôm (30f) recently single and have re-instated my dating apps. The main 2 I‚Äôve been looking at are Hinge (which I sense is more for serious r‚Äôships) and Feeld which is basically a sex / kink type app. The difference in the response to me on the two apps is insane!!!

On Hinge I‚Äôve been using up all my likes every day liking guys and always send a good message, not just a like. I‚Äôm getting basically no responses, no likes, been about 2 weeks now (I‚Äôm average looking with a nice body, def not ugly)

37,ppef29,1631802635,My friend is in an abusive relationship and I don‚Äôt know what to do,"So I have this friend who I originally met on Tinder (of all places) about 2 months ago who I kept speaking to after realising we aren‚Äôt for each other as she went to my school and we get on really well. I‚Äôd say she‚Äôs one of my best friends atm and we have been able to open up to each about rly private things so there‚Äôs a lotta trust there too

Anyway about a month ago she got a boyfriend - he‚Äôs rly funny and they seemed to get along fine from the outside (I didn‚Äôt notice any red flags at all) - but the whole time he has been abusing her, first mentally (don‚Äôt wanna get into the types of things he‚Äôs said, but very degrading and objectifying), then physically, twice so far. He‚Äôs already cheated on her too

And it took the second time she got hit for her to tell me about it, and I was the only one she told. I let her vent for a bit and gave her some advice which was basically to break up and she agreed saying that‚Äôs what all her mates say and that she‚Äôd ‚Äúdo it soon‚Äù

But she didn‚Äôt, even introduced all of her mates (including me) to him and we made plans to all play Destiny 2 together - and has even came to me for relationship advice a couple of times

She keeps telling me that she feels bad for speaking ill of him to me, as his dad died recently and he‚Äôs going through other things - she also mentioned this when she said she would break up

I personally think that she doesn‚Äôt want to let go as she was friends with him for years beforehand, along with the fact that she probably still likes him despite what he‚Äôs done - might even be in denial but I‚Äôd never say that to her face

Idk it‚Äôs definitely a weird situation but I feel I have to do something considering the circumstances.

40,ppem47,1631803275,"My (21M) GF (19F) is under stress from starting school and its affecting our relationship (long story, sorry)"," We have been dating for 4 months and everything for that duration was fine, it was perfect not a single problem. It is kind of long distance so there was usually a 1 or 2 week break when we saw each other but when we were together we spent like 4-6 days with each other.

But now she started university and its her first time being away from home and ever since she went our communication has not been the same at all. It isnt just because she is busy but she says its because she think school is too hard for her and its stressing her out. All the "" love u""-s ad romantic stuff have kind of stopped and we used to text basically the entire day when there was nothing going on during the summer but now not so much. It does not bother me that she is busy. I have tried to support her so much but it does not seem to help and feel kind of helpless. She actually admitted that it bothered her that I barley chatted with her some days during the summer and was sad because of it and even started doubting our relationship.

So while she is stressed out about school i am stressed about us. We have not seen each other for 3 or 4 weeks now and this issue has been going on for basically 2 weeks. So I thought i would try to give her a surprise visit while I was on my way to university myself. And we ended up not even meeting. She said that she was in a sad mood that day and she could not take it mentally. She also said she was scared of losing me so i think that she thought that i was there to break up with her which i assured her was not the case ( at least that time) but we still did not meet.

We still talk some about our days and some light banter but its just changed so much. She has told me plenty she does not want us to end but has suggested we take a break for a few days from talking a few times so she could concentrate on school but it was her who could not keep it up. I love her but I actually tried to break it off with her because I did not think I could not handle it anymore because I am freaking out too and being stuck in limbo like this is just so much worse and maybe if things clear up in the future we could see where we are but she got so upset about this and does not want us to break up at all.

So at this point I do not know what to do anymore. I guess we have had kind of a clingy relationship and I have kind of grown used to that but now that things have changed I can not really adjust back but I guess the best thing would be to give it time but I do not know how long I can keep it up.

47,ppfgqc,1631805940,Girl is confused?,"The story starts a full year ago (month September). So I was going out with my current male friends, until 3 girls joined our friend circle and started to go out with us. I think the main reason they started going out with us is because one of the girls (let's call her Ashley) liked one of my friends. 

It's 31st of December 2020. We organised a house party to celebrate the new year. From September i have not had conversations with any of the girls. That same night i got drunk. It was my first time drinking and it was fun. We got closer as friends with these girls.

February 2021. I don't know how you guys in America text on Instagram, but in my country we text via photo replies on Instagram (it is literally like Snapchat). I sent Ashley a photo and she replied back. We started texting and I could tell she had some interest in me. 

We get to the end of March. Me, Ashley and four other friends were outside just having fun in the snow. That day out of nowhere i started liking her. Before that I did not have any feelings towards her. I could tell she had some interest in me by that time, but i have not invited her out or something like that, because i was anxious of my friends and how they would accept me being in a relationship with her. And i started pursuing her. Because I was in love, i started sending her good morning and good night texts every day, sending her heart emojis,complimenting her just so i can keep the conversation going. At first she reacted possitive, but maybe because i was indecisive and did not invite to go out on a date she started to slowly lose interest and fall back.

End of April. Thing started to fall apart between us (the boys) and the girls.  We were at a house birthday party of one of the members of the friends group. We were all there (including Ashley and the other 2 girls). That night I was behaving kind of arrogant towards her and at the end of the night i appologized to her. The next morning she left me on seen. A month later they stopped going out with us.

Week before present time. I invited Ashley to my birthday party. And i sent her a photo and we started to text again. Two days later she sent me a boomerang video of herself in the bathroom while showering. From this moment till now she was going from hot to cold and from cold to hot. One day she would not send me a picture of herself, the other day she would send me picture of herself.

16th of Semptember. It is my birthday we celebrate, she hugged me and wished me happy birthday. I planned to dance with her, go and talk with her about stuff. But she went to bed early and nothing happened.

Here are my questions. What do i do this situation,do i give her space, do i initiate contact ,what do i do here? Why is she still replying to my photos, when she could easily leave on seen. I mean when we were still in the same frined group she left me on seen why she wouldn't leave me on seen now that we are not going out together. Is she confused about her feelings towards me?

49,ppfrjy,1631806877,Dating over 30 as a non-drinker," Recently out of a 14 year relationship and I'm having trouble finding compatible women in the dating scene. I've been on three dates since my break up. I have a lot going against me and very few things going for me (depending on who you ask, but I'm personally biased against myself). I'm healthy, tall, have a good career with plenty of money, and will (hopefully) own my own house in a month. Beyond that, I lack any confidence I had due to the divorce and infidelity from my wife.

I don't drink, I don't really do the club or going out scene as a side effect but I wouldn't be against going out with a group of friends. The problem is all of my guy friends in their 30's are wifed up. I don't know any single men in the area where I moved to. I'm in the OKC metro area and you'd think it would be easier but it's just not. The three dates I've been on have been from the usual assortment of apps. Don't get me started on the apps...for ever 1000 swipes, I maybe get one match that ends up being a ghost.

I changed up my wardrobe and started working out a little bit, but physically I am very thin and that's off-putting to most women. My BMI is healthy range but appearances are everything. The amount of physical change it would take to bulk up doesn't seem worth it at this time and it would be the millionth time I've tried, so I'm having to settle for people who like me as me. I'm a statistical person and I figure my chances are just really low with looks. Looks are the chemical gateway to love in a relationship, is what it is.

The things I'm into are pretty basic - photography, off-road stuff in the jeep, going on bike rides, and some nerdy stuff like graphic design and video games now and then (but I'm not addicted to them). I took every damn love language, enneagram, IQ test possible so I know what all of that means to me, I just don't know how to apply it to real world dating.

At 30, how do you get back out there after so long when you at least know what YOU want, but can't find anyone that's willing to shoot a glance back? I'm willing to try new things and go to new places, but I cannot handle the lame advice of ""just go to a coffee shop regularly, you'll meet someone"" - most women go through the drive through or don't want to be bothered when having coffee, and that shit is expensive and adds up.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ppfrjy/dating_over_30_as_a_nondrinker/
50,ppfrok,1631806888,How long does it even take to find a relationship on these apps?,"Have been doing online dating for more than 2.5 years now and maybe it's because I live rather rurally, but I have been struggling to make a real connection. Most dates ended with neither one of us asking the other person out again. Far from really clicking with someone, or the feeling wasn't mutual.

I am absolutely sure relationships can be found via these apps because friends of mine have been successful, but for me it seems like such a grind. When I swipe, there are so many profiles of people who don't seem to take this seriously (weird close up or only sunglasses pictures, or no pictures at all), and sifting through them is already quite some work. Most conversations either fade or never get picked up. From the few good conversations I have, only a few lead to dates. And then finally meeting the person and getting really weird or disinterested vibes is not nice either.

When I started dating via the apps, I thought it would work much faster. I know it's not a supermarket, but I heard it takes 20 dates to find someone, and now I am at 30. Well, somewhere else I read that it takes 45. On average, of course.

Someone please tell me, what is the truth and how long does it even take to find what I am looking for??!!??",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ppfrok/how_long_does_it_even_take_to_find_a_relationship/

I've just started dating again a couple months ago and I realized that not having dated for a few years, combined with the pandemic making me (more) socially awkward, I have no idea what to do anymore.

I've been seeing a girl (28) for the past few weeks, we've been on 4 dates so far and both expressed interest in a 5th. All of them have been great - we just talk for hours and it comes so naturally. But we still haven't kissed. Barely even touched, in fact. I wanted to kiss her on the 4th date when I walked her to her door but she had her mask on so we just hugged - which we also did on the 2nd date. How do I escalate the intimacy?

I‚Äôve never been asked out before, and I get rejected every time I make the first move. But whenever I ask for advice, people give me completely conflicting opinions. About half of the people I ask say something along the lines of: ‚Äúbe confident! Make the first move! Put yourself out there!‚Äù While the other half say: ‚Äúdon‚Äôt look for a partner! Love comes when you least expect it, if you keep looking or chasing guys you‚Äôll never find someone!‚Äù. Honestly I‚Äôm just not sure who‚Äôs advice I should be taking. Everyone makes it seem like women have it so easy and can get anyone to be interested in them, but I have yet to find a single person who is actually interested in me.

Before anyone mentions it: I already put all the work I can into myself, I finished therapy and figured out my style and makeup. I even fixed my posture and conversation skills. My face is kind of a sorry sight, but I have a nice body and most people seem to notice that first at least. My teeth are straight (thanks braces) and I managed to clear my skin and figure out a hair routine. There‚Äôs literally nothing else I can do to ‚Äúfix myself first‚Äù.

When we met, I had a boyfriend - who I was planning on ending things.  As soon as we started talking I was absolutely head over heels.  I was convinced we were soulmates.  The next following days I broke up with my boyfriend.  Mike and i kept talking and eventually started dating.  Fast forward a year, we break up because he was going away to school and wanted to explore other options and grow etc etc.  I was heartbroken.  Mike was the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.  3 years go by, I have another boyfriend.  We eventually break up, and time goes on and I decide to reach out to Mike just to ""catch up"".  We meet up and sparks fly everywhere.  We were hooked and wanted to be with each other.  I always had, and still do have a feeling he's the person I'm supposed to spend the rest of my life with.  Needless to say i am very much in love with him.  Last night he calls me and explains to me that he's extremely scared, and feels as though what happened to my very first boyfriend, could happen to him.  And that I could just find someone knew and walk away.  He keeps going on about how he doesn't think I'm over my ex, and how he's worried that ill just leaves etc etc.  This caught me off guard because of how much i care about mike, and how much i want to be with him - and have wanted to be with him over the years.  He says he trusts me, but because of what i did to my first boyfriend, he finds its difficult.  

Im not sure what to do - I've never cheated on anyone before.  I think of myself as a very loyal and devoted partner.  I wanted to end things with my first boyfriend for a while, and then when i met mike - it was game over and i knew he was the person i was supposed to be with.

62,ppgoxc,1631809765,"If I never ask a woman out again, am I guarenteed to stay single for the rest of my life?","I have Asperger's so I often have trouble socializing, communicating to other people and expressing my interest to other women I'm attracted to. 1 woman has approached me in the past 2 years but I wasn't really interested.

It seems like the women that I have a non-platonic interest in or interest in getting into a relationship never reciprocate interest with me. I'd rather be the one approached and I know this is going to sound cringeworthy, but I seek the validation at times being complimented physically by a woman, as I never have had this happen to me.

I remember in college I asked a good amount of people out (think somewhere between 50 and 100) and was rejected by all of them. They weren't supermodels, they just looked like normal women. 

I don't lift weights at the moment (I play basketball) but I can start if that would help at all. I used to lift weights but got into other sports lately. I work in programming at the moment .

The fact that I'm a 5'10"" Chinese American in a predominantly Caucasian area in the United States where on average men are around 6 feet tall doesn't really help me out, If I recall correctly. I am sometimes self conscious about my appearance (as vain as it sounds, I always think I'm not good looking enough) and have slight dysmorphia I believe. 

I'm average looking I believe. I want to be above average looking, but honestly it's counterintuitive to deny the truth and does more harm than good at this point. 

I practice being grateful, I have hobbies (I like to work on racecars, program, play piano, and diy activities) and am well-groomed. I go out to social events to have a good time. It's just I'm having trouble dating at the moment and just decided not to approach women for the past year and a half, and no one has approached me either, despite me encountering tens of thousands of people in the city that I live in over the past year. 

So, hit me with the truth: If I won't approach women I am interested in, will I stay single for the rest of my life? What can I do to accept this fate? Thanks for the help :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ppgoxc/if_i_never_ask_a_woman_out_again_am_i_guarenteed/

Early on we defined it as casual but it has become way more than casual. The feelings seemed to be mutual. And I was planning on having another conversation about our relationship soon.

69,ppgvl7,1631810317,Is there a way to look confident to women?,"



The topic at hand is someone (me) who has only been on one date in his life and is admitting he has no idea where to start. If I'm scared or unwilling to talk to people in a bookstore and think its a bad idea to approach people on campus then telling me to just ignore that and do it is bad advice.

I'm someone who doesn't even know the basics and you're telling me to just learn through trial by fire by approaching in an environment that could cause professional consequences for me. That's simply terrible advice. I can join clubs, go to parties, go to bars and a myriad of other avenues to meet students. Telling me to just randomly cold approach and everything will work out isn't the best way for me to get what I want. 

There is a place for random cold approaches, but it's not a successful strategy for someone who has zero idea how to approach women.

I'm not 100% outgoing nor am I introverted, I kind of reside in the middle of that spectrum.

I've only ever been on one date and I've been rejected by 2 other women. 

If it matters at all, I generally keep myself appearing smart- I like nice clothes and regularly get my hair professionally styled. 

I also use good aftershave and generally maintain a positive appearance to those around me.

Be that as it may, I suck at attracting women and have no idea where to even start. I regularly go to my local book store but that's hardly a good place to approach women is it?

I so doubt approaching undergraduate or postgraduate students is a good look either...

Help a brother out please?

TL;DR: I'm hopeless with dates and feel a bit lonely through it all.

70,ppgx12,1631810436,"What even happened here (sorry, long)","Im 25 F, he's 27...for context. Before going on this date, I made it very clear to him that I don't hook up. I was very straight up about what i want and that if it wasnt what he was into then we shouldn't waste eachothers time. I met this guy through friends and got the feeling that he was a bit of a player so making this clear felt critical. He ends up saying that he wants the same and so we plan a date. 

I get into his car and the first thing he does is grab my leg, practically slaps it. It kind of bothered me but I assumed maybe he was just messing around. He's not a complete pig usually. I wouldn't have gone on the date otherwise. We decide on take out and he brings us somewhere beautiful. The issue I start feeling is having no urge to speak to him about anything. Im an EXTREMELY talkative person and see it as something important for a first date. But I felt like everything we spoke about in the car was enough to gage where we both stood as people, which wasnt even negative really. I even told him that because i felt like he needed to know. We both sat in silence and just admired our surroundings. But part of me was wondering why i just didnt feel inspired enough to engage him in conversation at all. I felt this need to entertain him if that makes sense but just couldnt. 

We were just kind of staring off and i got into this really depressed headspace, followed by a couple drinks in. I felt like he was kind of feeling the same too because we both agreed that we should both just shut the fuck up for a second. We both just kind of sat there, admiring the landscape. Then he tried to kiss me which I found was uncomfortable for the first 2 hours of a date. I said I wasn't comfortable and he apologized. 

We stand up to leave and he asks if he can hug me and I agree. He then just holds me, in silence and he continues staring off. At one point I ask him what hes was thinking about and he just says ""i dont know. I like this"". We share a few laughs while just holding each other and decide to get back into the car and go somewhere else. He tells me he wants to bring me somewhere and I agree. 

We get to the other destination and hes holding my hand. I'm feeling extremely down for some reason. Something felt strange. Im an expressive person and I kept feeling bothered that I was coming off as really grumpy but he seemed kind of the same. IBut in the sense that we both didn't feel a need to hype ourselves up. Although I cant really speak for the way he felt but it seemed that way. Hes usually very uppity up.

Then the silence translated into me wondering if maybe he just wasn't feeling it, which was fine. But why was he prolonging the date? Hes a very upfront person. The silence turned into me just being unable to share anything. I started to get kind of uncomfortable and nervous, completely lost in my head.

He stood and held me again, practically squeezing me. We were staring off again. Then he grabbed my ass? I got angry at that point and confronted him about it. He said he was sorry and had gotten ""lost in the moment"". At this point I was just aggravated. I hadn't wanted to kiss him yet. Where would he have gotten the idea that doing that would've been cool with me? What the fuck was even going on? He apologized. 

So we stood there for a while. He was giving off strange vibes. I started to overthink everything. What the hell is he thinking? Why aren't we speaking? Why didn't he just bring me home? We usually talk a lot. I used to speak to him on the phone for hours, effortlessly. I tried to engage him in conversation again. We both work all the time and we kind of spoke about that. He mentions that hes glad he made time for this. Im a little confused at this point. I usually would've gotten up and left after someone i barely knew grabbed my ass. But i for some reason let it slide and felt almost concerned for him. I couldnt leave. I felt like we both just had no words. 

It was getting late so we hopped back into his car. He held my hand the whole time. We kind of made small talk in the car and he asked me if I was bored at one point. We got to my place and he asked if we could just sit for a minute. He told me that the date ended too soon and I agreed. I felt that way too. Its like we were both too lost in our heads to enjoy it. Time kind of slipped away. I dont even know how I feel other than kind of confused. He had given me his sweater at one point and i took it off before getting out of his car. He said he was surprised I didnt want to bring it home with me and i joked that he didn't have to worry about me robbing him.

We got out of the car and he hugged me again. We just kind of looked at eachother. He kept pulling away to leave and then would come back for another hug and joked that he didnt want to go. I joked that he could kidnap me if he wanted  to. We have a mutual friend that works at a restaurant that we often see eachother at. He asked when I'd be there next. His tone shifted at this point, he seemed more soft spoken than usual. We stood holding eachother again. This time he kissed my cheek. I didnt give a shit at this point honestly, lol. He joked that atleast he could kiss me somewhere on my face. 

He blew me a kiss goodbye and got into his car. I havent heard from him since. Its been a day. We both dont text much in generally so maybe thats normal. But what the hell happened here? Id like to add that we were smiling a lot throughout the entire date. It was never visibly awkward. I just overthink. Did he have a good time? Was he maybe just trying to hook up regardless of what I said? 

Guys, wouldn't you have just taken the girl home if you were not having a good time? Would you have pretended to not want to leave to avoid insulting the girl? Am I crazy?

76,pphupk,1631813250,How do you date when you're moving countries a lot?,"I (26M) will be in country A up until March of next year OR until January 2023. After that, I will be in country B for a minimum of 3 years, after which I will be either staying in country B, or moving to country C hopefully for good. My question is, what should I do about my dating life until I finally know where I will be staying? After not dating for the past 7 years while I was pursuing my first degree and working, I find that I would actually like to get out there now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also had an experience recently, where a woman I was getting to know started treating me like a leper upon hearing that I have not been in relationship in the past 6 years. It was very humiliating when she started chastising me, but I got over myself and now understand where she was coming from. So I understand that not having experience at my age is a red flag, and dating is like swimming in that you need to practice regularly to have good form and pace.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I do not see how I could have anything serious in the next \~4-5 years. I can't have the ""see where it goes"" attitude, because I will know the approximate expiration date on any relationships I have in countries A and B. I don't imagine that would be a healthy mindset to have, as I would either keep my partner at arm's length, or hurt us both when it's time to pack my suitcases. And I cannot ask my partner to leave their entire life behind and follow me to a different country, because I could not do the same for them, so it would not be fair. The next 10 years will be very important for my professional development, and I will not sacrifice it.  

&amp;#x200B;

Outside of being in a relationship when I was 18-19, I don't have any experience with casual dating or fwb, so I am not sure if that is even something I would enjoy. Which makes me unsure of what I should be aiming for in terms of dating while I am in countries A and B. I doubt people at my age would want to waste time in a relationship that has an expiration date. They probably want a LTR if they decide to get serious at this point in their life, and I don't think it would be right of me to not mention my itinerary. So I am stuck, unsure of what I have a right to wanting out of dating. Has anyone experienced a similar situation?

82,ppieiy,1631814965,Idk what this girl wants and because if that I‚Äôm not sure show to proceed,"

I‚Äôm 20M and she‚Äôs 20F we both go to uni together and are in the same course we started texting a while back over social media and initially i thought she was into me cuase she would say very provocative things over it like ‚ÄúI‚Äôd wanna do you‚Äù and stuff of that nature but blew off offers of meeting up or FaceTiming so I assumed she was just after validation so we I kept talking to her, now that things are in person we met up while she brought over a male friend of hers 

we went back to my place got drunk her and her friend starting puking and the guy passed out but before that she came onto both of us and ended up groping both of us so I gave her friend a bucket and made sure she was and puking in the toilet after a while I put her into my bed and was just sitting on the chair in my room next to her passed out friend and her lying in bed . Using on my phone but she seemed to sober up and pulled me into bed with her so we made out and got almost naked and she wanted to have sex but I said no as I wasn‚Äôt comfortable doing it with someone in that state 

Then we got dressed and left her friend passed out in my room and went to the kitchen and continued to make out then her friend woke up and chilled with us after which we led to go home. 

So we went back to my room and she got into bed and dragged me in again where we spent the night basically naked together talking and kissing and in the process she sucked me off and we didn‚Äôt go further (I think due to her bieng on her period) 

The next morning she was still into me we still kissed and went to one of our classes and while there she was touching me a bit in class 

Day after that we met up and went to one of our classes throughout she was touching me a lot 

And then yesterday she had to do a thing for our university so I joined her and throughout it she run into me hold my hand a bit or grope my arm,after that we went to my place for like 40 min and chilled while cuddling a bit and kissed a bit 

Today we met up before class and went for a small walk before chilling for a bit on a bench in which we again held hands a bit 

I do notice a common moment that she does this only when none of her friends  are around which makes sense as she complains about how half of them have crushes on her ,so clearly she doesn‚Äôt want  people to know 

But she‚Äôs also said to me while complaining about them ‚Äúthey know that I‚Äôm not looking for anything right now ‚Äú 

Ps sometimes she starts the conversations and today she initiated us meeting before class 

She also says nice thing to me while we hang like that I‚Äôm cute or sweet or that I smell really good 

But she also complained  to me how some guy she had a crush on has replaced her and it bums her out 

So I‚Äôm not sure what she‚Äôs after or what she wants and because of that idk how to act and to proceed. I personally do enjoy hanging out with her but I‚Äôm not madly in love with her and if she‚Äôs just into a fwb situation that‚Äôs fine with me and if she wants to date I‚Äôm open to giving That a try

My ex stayed  with me until  I healed  after that we both  realized it's  ended . I know that I tried  my best , and there  no regrets left  behind. But everything  before that I forgave her and I chose to move on.

93,ppj34w,1631817045,Should I continue to get to know this guy... Who just broke up,"Met a guy on hinge who just broke up. Found out he downloaded hinge and deleted it after 2 days given how he shouldn't be on dating apps after breaking up so recently. But fortunately (or unfortunately) for me, he somehow decided he still wanted to go on a date with me, even though he cancelled all of his other planned dates. Anddddddd, we ended up really liking each other. 

I'm scared that I'm be rebound, which I've expressed to him multiple times. He has told and reassured me that I am not rebound, which is why he wants to continue to take things slow with me, get to know me, spend more time with me, and not have any titles. He's taken me on several dates already. He's always tried to get to know me better. And he always is telling me that he is worried on hurting me since he recently broke up, and he doesn't want to hurt me. We've kissed already, and the sexual chemistry is definitely there for both of us.

Should I trust him that I'm not rebound? Part of me says yes, since he is actually putting a lot of effort to get to know me as a person, not as a physical/sexual object.
