I'll be leaving town in a couple of weeks (temporarily), and he knew this. So him asking me out again seemed pretty intentional, and not just a ""we should do this again!"" type thing. 

Since our date, I've texted him to say ""thank you and that I had a great time. I hope you did too"". He hasn't responded since then. It's been 5 days. 

I know there are a multitude of reasons for why guys suddenly go cold, but I'm wondering if it's possible that he's unsure of exactly how interested I am.

I would have thought my message invited a response, even if not a 2nd date (despite the fact he asked for one in person already).

Should I text him again, asking what's up? or does this seem like a ghosting?

Only kissed a few girls and some slight touching, but those occasions can be counted on one hand. Reason is anxiety, but I would assume it is not visible, as I just seem to be friendzoning girls if they are trying anything.

I totally get that some women will not be interested in a man if they realise he have no experience with sex, initimacy and relationships. I mean, most people probably look for someone on their level and i am way below most womens sexual level at this age.

But assume i am like most people are and described as social, likeable, funny, plenty of friends. 6'1, heard numerous times i have a fit body, nice education, nice job, but bald, if that matters.

Let's say i actually manage to work through with my anxiety (meeting therapist atm) and somehow manage to get a date, what course of action should i take to minimize the risk of getting rejected due to my inexperience? Should i take it really slow to let the women get to know me better before i tell them anything? Downplay the whole thing about my inexperience once i tell them? Don't tell them at all since most people assume i had sex?

I get it that some won't even care about it, and some will reject a guy as soon as they hear about it. But I just want to to minimize the amount of people that reject me once they hear it.

‚Äú is it because you don‚Äôt want to be a home wrecker? ‚Äú and I said ‚Äú no I just don‚Äôt like you‚Äù. Hurt his ego so bad he blocked me, and unblocked me just so he can call me again ,which I ignored.

This is discouraging for me, because I just got out of a bad dating experience, we dated and live together for 2 months and than he left or cheated. It made me wonder if the guy had a girlfriend the whole time I didn‚Äôt know about, he introduced me to his closest friends too and now I‚Äôm thinking was his friend tried to cover for him.

It stems from the fact that I haven't gotten a single date after all the effort I spent. And it mostly stems from the fact that I haven't been able to meet anyone. IRL, I go to events all the time and try my best to make connections, but the people I meet are never consistent and most people I meet never come back. And the worst part is that I'm a geek who likes anime and games so not a lot of girls show up to those events anyway. It's hard for me to even consistently make in person friends, let alone meet a girl IRL

I tried online dating and that didn't help either. The same problem occurred, no one was willing to talk to me. I kept mulling over why no one was even willing to talk or even attracted to me. Was it the fact that I'm 5'6? Was it the fact that my face and voice look and sound like a kid's? Was the fact that my room is always a mess somehow indicated on me in some way? It eventually got to the point where what little confidence I had in myself was gone

I've been trying to find some kind of scaffolding to climb myself out of this hole and love myself again. But every now and then, something sneaks into my Youtube recommendations or I see something on the street that shows other people's success in dating and it just makes me bitter inside all over again. Plus it feels like a lot of my qualities have already died out in some way anyways. I always tried my best to be kind to others, I'm learning how to be more consistently funny, and I get relatively good grades. I was even an All As and Bs student back in high school. But every now and then, something happens. I see other couples on the street, something pops into my recommendation that shows people and even my favorite content creators having a dating life while mine is empty. I end up becoming bitter, resentful and jealous of them. To top it all off, as unhealthy as it is, I end up feeling rushed. If it's this hard to find people at the college level, then it's only going to become more impossible as I get older

Honestly, I just want confidence and hope that things will become better for me. This is something that I really want and just can't seem to let go. I can't gain any dating experience to train my awkward self into being able to attract girls, I lack any confidence in myself which is further reinforced by a year of ghosting, and I can't even find a lot of girls with similar interests, let alone ones I'm physically attracted to.

Then I decided to call him to have a drink. I was pretty sure that he would not ignore me. He immediately accepted to meet me. Afterwards we went to his place which was very close to the place where we met. I was crying on his shoulders and hugging him. Tbh it made feel also good to be hugged by him. When the time came up to leave his place, ƒ∞ kissed him from his lips. He was very surprised and he also kissed me again. Maybe I just took advantage of his attention on me. As it comes to my feelings, I am not in same point with me. ƒ∞ also don't want to hurt him. Once he told me that I woke up a man in him. ƒ∞ can see that he is obviously very happy with me. Many people around him is aware of his happiness. Even her mother understood from his joyful voice. Those things make me feel responsible. Meanwhile I want to see him, and I want to take it slowly until I got ride of feelings over guy1. He also seems he is ready to commit himself to him. He doesn't only ask physical intimacy, also emotional intimacy with me. This is actually what I want from a relationship. Does time really help to nourish feelings over guy2? I should also say that I don't have a secure attachment profile.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qd1s1t/i_dont_feel_excited_as_much_as_he_does/
30,qd1tqb,1634851493,People change!,"Years ago when I was still relatively new to Tinder, I matched with a girl who seemed to have pretty similar interests. The Tinder scene here is loaded with professional photoshoot quality pictures of influencers and thrill seekers. It certainly does not leave much for the average dude. This girl, however, was really pretty and genuinely seemed to like the same things that I did. I considered it a win that she even responded to me to begin with if I'm being honest. 

Fast forward a bit and we meet in person. It was a killer experience. She seemed very sweet and shy, but still was a lot of fun to be around. We walked around the zoo and talked a bit and by the end of our first date we agreed that we'd like to do it again. After I'd walked her to her car, I mentioned that I felt like we'd met before. I couldn't put my finger on it, but something about her seemed really familiar. She smiled at me and said ""We have.""

Turns out that the girl I'd just gone on a date with was somebody I went to high school with, albeit a much different version of her. She was a grade below me, very unkempt and riddled with behavioral issues. She was suspended several times for hissing and biting at people. Since she was well known for being obnoxious and an all around scrub, I steered as far away from her as possible. 

I couldn't believe her when she told me. What made the experience even more interesting was her willingness to talk about her high school days. She explained to me that there were some outside factors and a pretty rough home life that had caused her some serious behavioral problems for years. She explained that she had hated how she acted in school, but it was brought on by legitimate mental health issues. 

We actually continued dating for 6 or 7 months after. We eventually separated on mutual terms, and she's married now to my knowledge. No substantial lesson or big story here, just thought it would be fun to share!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qd1tqb/people_change/

Which I gave to her. I just messaged once a week to check in with her. Then yesterday I went to message her and saw she‚Äôs blocked me from all social media so I can‚Äôt get a hold of her. 

She had previously come out of a long relationship (6 years) and all along we‚Äôd discussed that we were taking it slow and she had said she didn‚Äôt know what she was going to want in the future. But she promised me she wouldn‚Äôt hurt me and that she‚Äôd always be up front and honest with me if she changed her mind about us. 

She might of decided that she‚Äôs not ready for another relationship right now and I could accept that if she told me. But now I am wondering if I did something wrong or I upset her. I have left her a voicemail just asking if she could tell me what happened but I don‚Äôt even know if she‚Äôll receive it let alone respond to it. 

I feel awful now that she couldn‚Äôt even talk to me and felt she just had to block me out. She was always very affectionate and sweet towards me until she suddenly started to drop contact with me and now she‚Äôs ghosted me. I just feel really upset right now.

I went on a handful of dates before ending up having a long distance relationship with this girl a few hours away we where together for 2 or 3 months and at that point I decided she wasn‚Äôt the one for me I, I was working a lot of hours at the time so all my free time was devoted her which is nice at times but it‚Äôs also nice to be able to be with someone who understands sometimes I just need alone time. After breaking up with her I saw a friend of a friend for a little bit but I wasn‚Äôt really ready for anything just yet. Then this summer a old friend of mine who I have dated before and have been crazy about since I was 18 texted me and explained that she had just gotten out of the hospital after a 3 week mental health visit. At that point I thought well this is going to be the old song and dance where we will text for like two weeks and then she will ghost me or something but I felt bad for her so I said let me meet up with her and see. Well to my surprise it wasn‚Äôt the old song and dance she seemed to have a really good grasp on her mental health challenges and we ended seeing each other a bunch this summer and I really enjoyed the time I spent with her I have always helped her with her mental health and continued to. Then the other day she had a big fight with her mom who she lives with and her mom said that I only want to have sex with her and that she can‚Äôt see me anymore. This whole time I have been seeing her I have been respectful of the fact that she wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship yet and frankly I enjoy being friends with her so I was happy just to hang out and then she hits me with the I can‚Äôt see you anymore and I‚Äôm kinda lost on how I feel about it on the one hand it feels like we just went back to the old song and dance of her fading in and out of my life but on the other I want to be there for her since that‚Äôs why she contacted me once she got out of the hospital. I really like this girl and was excited because things really felt different this time I get this spark in me when I think about her and frankly I have never felt this way with another girl.

41,qd2lnd,1634853877,Things are going well and moving very fast. Scared I‚Äôll mess it up.,"I recently got out of an abusive long term relationship with drinking involved and emotional cheating she would never admit to.

Have been dating around for 7 months now with some good success and a few duds. Almost had a relationship with a nice nerdy cute girl but she had some issues for whatever reason when things started to look like committing. The same thing happened after a few months with another girl, who wasn‚Äôt as emotionally troubled and confused with their life but was VERY busy. So it‚Äôs pretty realistic they just didn‚Äôt have the time. 

It‚Äôs only been 3 weeks with this new girl‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs like we‚Äôve known eachother forever. Can stay up all night (literally did on the 4th date) and talk about nothing. Have the funniest and most random things in common. She‚Äôs also drop dead cute and beautiful. 

We have talked about ‚Äúus‚Äù some and she told me that she hasn‚Äôt told another guy she liked them in at least a year. So as long as we keep it up, I can see some good things happening.

The problem is she doesn‚Äôt text as much as I‚Äôd like and initiate conversations. I kinda mentioned it but told her I understand she‚Äôs busy and she said ‚Äúthank you‚Äù.

Anyway I should probably just do my best to not seem needy and bother her too much, but with how well we get along‚Ä¶ after only a month I kind of want to ask her about being exclusive even though I‚Äôm seeing a few other people here and there too. With some of them, if I go off the radar long enough they always initiate ‚Äúhey why are we not talking let‚Äôs hang‚Äù like I‚Äôd like her to.

42,qd2rj4,1634854365,What do I need to work on to find someone?,"I'm a 29 year old guy and to be honest I'm finding dating so frustrating. I do want to settle down and start a family, but it's hard to find that someone. There's good things about me but I know there's things I need to work on.
TLDR, I need my own place and lose a bit of weight before I'll be taken more seriously in dating. Does that sound right? 

Career
I'm a software developer and I make fairly good money. With a bit of graft I know that my earning potential can be even greater. The IT industry as a whole is mostly male so its unlikely I'll meet someone through work. 

Hobbies/lifestyle 
Music is my passion and is a huge part of my life. I was in a band up until May of this year. I left for a few reasons, but I now realise how that was making me very one dimensional as most conversations would be centrered on that. Also, it was a massive drain on my time and finances. I started a promotions company nearly 3 years ago and that's something I'm immensely proud of and passionate about. I also manage 2 bands. This keeps me in touch with people in the music industry, and makes me feel fulfilled. I'd have thought I'd met someone at a gig by now. It seems that most girls I meet are either taken, too old.. Some have shown interest in me, but like I say they're much older. I did meet someone not so long ago but I asked her out and she wasn't interested. 
I like going to the gym, cooking, some retro gaming, and art too. I've been told I can hold a good conversation. 

Living situation
Probably a deal breaker. I did move back home in May of this year. I lost my job and to be honest it hit me very hard. I am going to be moving out soon though, once I'm settled in my new job. I do think I'd have better luck if I moved to a different area too. I live in a small town and dating was much easier when I lived in the city. 

Physical appearance 
I'm about 5ft9.. Can't change that. I have long hair. I was a lot more successful with women when I had shorter hair, so maybe I need to cut my hair if I'm serious about finding someone. I do need to lose some weight too, I'll admit. I did lose about 30lbs over lockdown but there's still work to be done. The long hair is like marmite to women I've found. 

I've used dating apps before, I'll admit I've been too reliant on them. I feel more confident talking to women at concerts, but that's the only place I really meet people to be honest.

I work remotely as an engineer for a company in the Bay area from my place in suburban Dallas, since graduating from university. I have the option to work anywhere remotely in the US. One criteria I'm looking at in a city is the dating scene/pool. 

The issue I'm having right now is that there aren't a lot of college educated young people (22-27) in the Dallas area, those who do are predominantly families with children. Its also a pretty boring place, and there aren't a lot of places/scenes to meet young people, and downtown is pretty dead after working hours pre-covid, so even that isn't an option. A lot of social interactions happen at church, but I am not a Christian (Hindu) so that isn't an option. 

Moving to the bay area isnt a viable option either. Because of the tech industry, there are significantly more men than women, and the odds are stacked against straight men dating.

I'm naturally an enthusiastic texter so I usually try and hold myself back from over-texting them and try and match their general conversation flow.

This woman who I was very excited about going on a 2nd date with on Sunday just canceled and told me she wasn't interested in pursuing things further.

50,qd32vc,1634855360,Just ranting and looking for support,"In late August I met this wonderful woman on Tinder. We kicked it off great and saw each other a couple of days later and hung out for 6 plus hours in her neighborhood. We had good conversations and even ended up kissing and messing around a little towards the end of the date. She held out on having sex because she said she liked me and I respected that. She asked me if I wanted to see her again and I told her I did and was upfront with her about my current situation about being unemployed but that I'm actively interviewing for new jobs on a weekly basis and she was fucking cool as shit about it and incredibly supportive and told me we would be cute together. Fast forward to our second date and everything was going perfect again. This time around we ended up having sex and it was awesome. After when we were cuddling I told her how happy I was that we met and she agreed. We hung out two more times and it was all going perfectly. I even asked her if she was seeing anyone else and if she was I was cool with it, I just wanted to know for respect and honesty reasons - she said no. After our 4th date, everything was still going smoothly. We went back and forth about how we missed each other and she even invited me to hang a couple of times but I wasn't up to it. Made up some white lies to get out of it but it wasn't out of not enjoying her company, I just felt like not doing anything on those days she invited me out. That weekend after our 4th date everything was still good, we were texting and I was being sweet and telling her I miss her and want to cuddle her and kiss her and she enjoyed it and said the same. That Sunday is when things got weird. She texted me in the afternoon asking what I was doing and I told her I was just hanging out watching football and it almost seemed like it bugged her to an extent and the conversation kind of turned for the worse in terms of the energy I was feeling going back and forth. We texted until the evening time and I asked her if she wanted to hang out again this week and I got no response. The next morning I shot her another text asking if she was available to hang that night and she said she had plans with some friends. This went on all week. She was being very vague and that Friday she sent me a really nice text when she was out with her friends. We ended up seeing each other for a 5th time about a week later and when I got to her place her energy felt weird. She was all over the place and I even got her a dozen roses but the response was kinda bland. We continued the date and kissed and even cuddled and watched a show we both like and after we started kissing and she said she wanted to be honest with me and that she had sex with someone else and wanted to continue to see him - she even pulled me in close and started cuddling me again and we had a decent convo about what to expect moving forward. I told her I still wanted to see her and she agreed but it felt like she was doing it out of sympathy. I was gutted, I'm not gonna lie. We continued the conversation and she recommended that we don't text every day anymore and that she felt the connection was wearing off. A couple of days later I shot her a text saying I understand and respect your decision to not see me anymore and I truly did enjoy every minute I spent with you and I hope she finds what she's looking for. She responded with a long text saying it wasn't anything I did but the whole wanting to hang out with someone else. Anyways, it's been about 3 weeks and I'm still thinking about her nonstop. We still view each other's stories on IG whenever we post and each time I get this incredibly sad feeling that I won't be seeing her anymore. I want to text her but I know that's a horrible idea and this feeling will eventually wear off. The shittest part of it all is I have good intuition and the whole time we were hanging out I had this nagging feeling about her but I continued to ignore it and decided to be optimistic. I don't know what the purpose of this post is but I guess it's just for support. I really liked her and I honestly have never felt that way about anyone. I'm a good looking guy, 6'4, blue eyes, and have a great face and atheltic body (not trying to be egotistical) I'm overthinking about her every day and wanting to text her but at the same time I'm holding on to this little bit of hope that she will eventually change her mind and I'll get this text from her admitting she made a mistake (I know, this is dumb).

68,qd4gd8,1634859843,TOP 5 RED FLAGS,"You just found the person you want to spend every minute of your time with. But are they the one? I had the opportunity to sit down with some friends and discuss the top 5 Red Flags that we have noticed after dating around.

1. Love Bombing; Love Bombing is a type of narcissistic tendency that can ultimately develop into an abusive relationship. Personally, I have seen this. The relationship feels like it‚Äôs moving a bit TOO fast. Love bombing is not just dropping your pants too soon. Love bombing is a form of manipulation that an individual will utilize in order to influence the other individual through demonstrations of attention and affection. A good example of this is saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù right out of the gate. There is no fine line with when certain things can be said or done in a relationship, but if you personally feel that things are moving a little quick, take a step back and reevaluate the situation. Are there any other red flags you have noticed?
2. Controlling; Another example of a toxic tendency in a relationship is the attempt to control the other individual. Whether this be through telling him/her what to wear or who they can/can‚Äôt hang out with. At the end of the day, a relationship consists of two individuals. A relationship does not signify the loss of your personal identity. Oftentimes, two people will become so intertwined with one another, that they forget the life they had before meeting this person. Although you are now in a relationship, you are still your own person. Your significant other‚Äôs opinion should not be the end all be all. When your partner is attempting to control you, this is a red flag. There should be a mutual understanding that you each have your own individuality and can still enjoy life without your partner breathing down your neck.
3. Bad relationships with friends and family; This can also be a major red flag. Yes, everyone experiences issues with their friends and family, but typically a mature adult will be able to have open conversations with the important people in his/her life. If you notice that your significant other has bad relationships with what seems like everyone, maybe this is a testament to how your relationship is going to develop. If he/she cannot maintain a healthy relationship anywhere else in their life, how are they going to pull it together for you?
4. Talking about their ex-partner WAY too much; banter about past relationships is normal and actually healthy. It is helpful to discuss past relationships that may have failed due to certain issues arising. When you and your partner both feel comfortable to have an open conversation about your past, do so. However, there is a fine line between healthy banter vs. demonstrating an obsession with your ex-partner. Oftentimes, someone who is constantly venting about their past relationships, is still not over their ex or has not found contentment in themself as an individual. This is a red flag and is often hard to deal with because it can become draining. You feel as if you have been shoved to the back burner. So, avoid this! Find someone who is comfortable with themself.
5. Being flakey; last and not least is a personal tell-tale for me. At the end of the day, what separates a good partner from a bad partner is reliability. In every relationship that has failed, thus far, I was bombarded with excuse after excuse. We would make plans that would fall through, not to much of my surprise, as I almost expected it every time. Find a partner who wants to be there for you. Find someone who enjoys helping you out, not because they get something out of it, but because they care for you. Did they promise to go to an event with you and then flake at the last minute? Oh wait, that happens every other weekend? THEY ARE FLAKEY!!!! Date someone who you trust your life with. Someone who you know, will always have your back, and until then, surround yourself with people who do love you and learn to love yourself first before giving someone the power to love you.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qd4gd8/top_5_red_flags/
69,qd4m6j,1634860394,I need a new plan. This just isn‚Äôt working,"I struggle with dating apps. 

I don‚Äôt take that many photos of my life but I did take a few and they got me some matches (about one per day or so) but the conversation was almost impossible to properly begin, let alone organise a date. 

I experimented with forwardness, quirkiness, trying to funny, trying to just say what came naturally to my mind, but alas: no sauce. Most of the conversations fizzled out or the dates I went on didn‚Äôt have the chemistry.

So I tried the old school approach. I started building a group of friends at my rock climbing gym and we‚Äôve taken some steps to get more social. The issue here is that the vast majority of the girls we bump into at the climbing gym are either spoken for or swarmed with male attention. 

I‚Äôm not super forward naturally, and I can play the aggressive forward guy reasonably well but only for so long, it‚Äôs exhausting otherwise not being me me. 

When I‚Äôm just me, I don‚Äôt naturally catch the eye of many women, to be honest I feel kinda invisible most of the time.

We seemed to have hit a bit of a dead end. With the Covid precautions still in place it‚Äôs tricky getting the guys to meet up outside of the climbing gym, and I‚Äôm stuck figuring out what direction to go.

71,qd4nv5,1634860555,Anyone else feel this way?," 

Im a 19\[M\] and the following is what I ecounter on a daily basis with online dating. I primarily use Hinge due to the profile creation of prompts and creativity of sending messages. Plus I often get more matches and convos.

I match with a nice girl, I start the conversation and make a funny joke in regards to her hobbies, I talk to her about my hobbies. She thinks I'm funny and asks for my Insta.

We both follow each other and have more conversations. I flirt a little (Without being pushy or needy) and a day later I set up a date for tea and a walk in a public park with my two dogs.

She confirms and gets excited to see me and I loo forward to the date.

The day before the date I confirm and ask if she's still down. She still confrims. great.

The day of the date she texts saying ""I won't be able to make it, something came up.""

I reply to her and keep it cool and say ""thanks for letting me know, we can reschedule another day.""

I never hear from them again. Why do girls flake like this last minute? Im genuinely curious as to why girls emotions change the day of the date and if I did something to throw them off. What makes you want to cancel a plan last second? This has been happening on 95% of my dates and matches so far and it's super fucking exhausting.

86,qd5bw1,1634862826,Cheated.,"
 I cheated on my girlfriend of 6 months. I was talking to other girls the whole time. I have deep seated problems with insecurity. I think I know the reason I did what I did. I have abandonment issues about my mom and dad. Same reason I hoard items. I felt uncomfortable with for a lack of better words, putting my eggs in one basket. The basket being her. 


      I knew it was wrong, but I thought I was protecting myself. In reality I hurt the ONLY person who didn‚Äôt abandon me. I‚Äôve lied and I‚Äôve cheated. Our relationship is over because of me. Someone I love is hurt because of me. Because of me all this happened. 

      Because of me my whole world crashed and burned around me. I deserve this. This is what I get for hurting her. She‚Äôs cordial. Surprisingly. She‚Äôs gracious. 

    She wants me to go to a therapist and ‚Äúwants to see how this works out for me‚Äù. I need help. Please no judgement. I already feel like shit and am on the edge due to this and a recent suicide of a friend. There‚Äôs nothing you can say to make me feel worse. Any help?

88,qd5ctw,1634862918,Is cold approaches the best for average guys?,"I have tried online dating but the prospect seems grim, I will admit I am not blessed with model standard genetics but I‚Äôm not too disadvantaged either. But it seems like being average or above average is never enough, I have tried all major dating apps and followed all the guides out there, on pictures, bio, and have very little matches so far, and the few that I got often ended no where or being ghosted. Then I started reading about how hard it is for most guys on OLD apps. Because it‚Äôs so hard for people to feel who you are through pictures and words alone. And I‚Äôm a pretty easy going person with friends and relationships before, but I gave these apps a try since covid restricts my work and school environment a lot. I just feel like being an average guy, these apps just aren‚Äôt meant for me. I have been looking into doing cold approaches because I never had the courage to do anything like that, all my previous few relationships were from school/ work where I get to talk to the girl before making the move. Is this the solution for someone like me? I think that I have nothing to lose, and a chance to improve myself and my confidence, and showing the girl I‚Äôm interested in my personality in person right away drives up my chances significantly, even if I face tons of rejection at first. But there is also an argument that a man should just focus on himself and then the rest will fall into place, well I‚Äôm just too bored and just want to go out there have fun and meet new people.

TL/DR: OLD apps are not meant for average dudes, is cold approaches the best next choice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qd5ctw/is_cold_approaches_the_best_for_average_guys/

96,qd6glt,1634866737,Emotional wreck due to being ghosted,"This girl (28F) I met on a dating app chatted with me for 2 months getting to know each other really well and everything was clicking due to our similar interests in pretty much everything.  I caught the flue and she still sticked around chatting and after a month later, we went on our first date and things went really well!  She even insisted for the second date asap after our first date.  I was mind blown and felt I found the one.  When the second date rolled around, everything seemed like it was going well until the 3rd hour mark when I noticed she seemed annoyed and wanted to go home because she was tired.  So I went ahead and walked her to her car and she gave me a hug and left.  I wrote asking that I enjoyed our time and would like to know if she's still interested and it took her nearly 2 days to respond and she said she was tied up with work, but she did enjoyed the date and is open for another one.  So the third date goes as planned.  However, towards the end of the date she pulled the same cue of being tired and wanting to go home.  She gave the hug and walked to her car and left again.  Now it's been two weeks since she wrote back and I'm just crushed, beyond crushed because I never felt this ""love"" feeling towards anyone.  Most girls would be more like ""fuck"" feeling and it would pass in a day or two.  I wrote her already a few times checking up with her and nothing.  

The only thing that I can think of is that during our second and third dates I didn't really do any physical contact towards her or flirt.  I just hung out with her and just wanted to get the feelings towards each other while we play our gaming activities and talk. I did touch her on the shoulder when making a point on things and we did hug.  However, we never had the chance to make good eye contact and sit together since we were always moving around.  I'm absoutly hurt and I can't sleep or eat properly because of this.  Why would she ghost?
