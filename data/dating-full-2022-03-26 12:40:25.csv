A few questions: 

1. Should I break up via phone call, or in person? In any past breakup with a woman I was actually in a relationship with, I have always broken up in person. However, considering I’ve only been seeing this woman for 3 weeks, is ending it in person even necessary? Or would a phone call suffice? I almost feel like a phone call would be easier on her emotionally since she’s so attached after only 3 weeks, and since this news will be so sudden for her.

I've been bashed on behaviour that is not appreciated from my side, but from the partner's side all is magically excused ... I've been told that I need to work on myself, my results aren't tangible, my problems are downplayed. I'm just exhausted and finding myself in the exact same position as in my last relationship. I'm needing to make the decision whether to pick up whatevers left of me and move on or stay and work on it... But my heart has no desire to stay. I need to heal.

But it's still very hard. I'm going to be responsible for breaking someone's heart. I stress about how other people receive the news before I get to stress about it... myself... I know...that's my own doing... I'm trying to lesrn how to manage that better ... Am I selfish for having the desire to be single and free? Make unapologetic decisions about how I want my life to be... I comprised on all important things in life for my partner, only to hear that my dreams/goals/ambitions don't have any place next to the life that my partner wants...

I've been following this reddit page for some time and never felt like I had a good story to contribute but now my time has come...

So, in January, I (25F) matched with this cute guy (27M) on bumble. I didn't want to waste any time messaging back and forth for weeks, so we exchanged messages for an evening and agreed to meet the next day. From there, it really went fast. We met, we walked a lot, he was nice. Even though I was unsure that I wanted to see him again after date 1, he really wanted to see me, so I agreed to go sledding with him instead of a full-blown date. He fell down the stairs at one point, I had a really good laugh and from then on, I thought ""yeah, I could see more of this guy"". So, we ended up seeing each other 4 times over the course of the next week. By the end we were spending 7-8 hours together at a time. Last date, we sleep together, it was great. He heads off to the cottage for the weekend with friends and ends it Sunday. This leaves me all sorts of confused because it was really going well, and we had made plans to see each other Sunday night. I was fully expecting him. His reasoning: he rekindled an old flame. 

Nothing happens over the course of the next month. It is just me moving on. I start dating a few guys by the end of February. 

Fast forward to March, I message him out of the blue asking him about a hike. He gives me the information I need and says he's happy to hear from me because he ""lost"" my number. He then proceeds to tell me he is leaving for 2 months to go join the foreign fighters. We chat a little more (me asking questions about it). He then tells me he'd like to see me again, more specifically, his last night before leaving. He claims that he told his friends and family he was leaving a little earlier so he can prepare and process it all before leaving. He says he wants to hangout with someone he likes but won't necessarily get too emotional saying goodbye to. I say yes, thinking this a good opportunity to first say bye in case he doesn't make it back and second just to recalibrate my mindset to really see if we were truly a great match. So, he comes over, I make supper, we chat for a couple hours, and then we end with a proper send off... We have our goodbye, it is sad. I wish him well. 

Since he is in a warzone, I decide to only message him once a week saying, ""hope you are still ok &lt;3"". But after what happened at the military base housing many foreigners, I really start to worry about him. I'm not in love with him but I sure as hell don't want to see him die. So, after being in the dark for almost three weeks, I decide to drop a letter off at his place for his roommate to see. In the letter, I briefly introduce myself, saying I'm his friend and I was hoping as his roommate she might be able to confirm that he is at least alive and well. This was Wednesday night. Friday morning, I get a message from him saying he is alright, he misses me, he has joined foreign troops and is making his way south. So, I'm relieved, still surprised to hear from him instead of the roommate but just think the roommate did quick work of my letter. Later that afternoon, I get another text message from him saying ""I heard you left my roommate a letter.... she is actually not my roommate; she is my girlfriend. She is my everything, I truly love her. I think she will message you soon, would you mind just telling her we are just friends"". So, at this point I still think he is still in a warzone, so I reply back with ""Ok, since you are in a warzone. I will patch your relationship for you but when you get back you will have some work to do"". A few more messages are exchanged, then I ask if he is actually where he claims to be...to which he says no.....

So, in summary, he lied about going to a warzone for two months because that was the only excuse for limited communication, he could come up with that would allow him to pick up where we left off after she left again. The reason he was only going for two months is because his girlfriend works up north for about 10 months a year, probably earning big isolation pay dollars so they can buy a house someday, but she leaves him lonely for 10 months out of the year. His ""roommate"" is definitely not a lesbian. The reason we broke up in January was because he made it work with her again. So, I don't expect to hear from him again. I obviously didn't know he was in relationship. My letter of concern definitely ruined his Friday night plans. He also told me he didn't expect me to care so much about the fact that he was entering a warzone...

I know that I'm going to erase this post, I'm just so sad and stunted and feel like I'll never find anyone for me. 

I'm 39\[f\]. I am fortunate in so many aspects of my life, and never want to sound ungrateful. But feel so hopeless, insecure, worthless, and unsure of my future. 

I have a beautiful face and notably magnificent eyes. I've been approached to model numerous times in my life. It's the one plus I've always had going for me. I (genuinely not delusionally)  look at least 10+ years younger than my age. Some of my absolute best friends are in their early to mid 20s and we originally connected because of circumstance and finding common ground in humour and our field. They had ZERO idea I was my age before I confessed (not a humble brag just trying to provide context). I have 3 degrees. I was voted funniest person in my grad class. 

My body has always been tough. I've been chubby (mid range) my entire life, except when I was active in my eating disorder. Once I was ""thin"" I became unstoppable. My highschool crush (hottest/most popular guy in school) of  5 years became enamored and I ended up rejecting HIM. Still to this day, I know the power I have in my post-adolescent looks. 

BUT. Big BUT. I spent my entire 20s with my (still) best friend which didn't work out romantically, my 30s dating some of the hottest men I could have ever hoped for (genuine models) as a chubby teenage dork.  

 Since I grew up bullied, not conventionally super attractive, I have a non-judgemental kindness, humour, and naivety that would usually be a big plus in dating contexts. 

Yet I cant seem to get out of the mindset of being and dating all of these traditionally handsome men like in my 20s. But in recent years I have gone through some ""aesthetic misfortune"". 

I developed a skin condition that has affected primarily my torso. I am covered in horrible ugly purple scars (similarly to acne scars). Quarantine granted me some fresh stretch marks on my stomach unrelated to pregnancy (which seems for some reason to be more accepted). 

I now appear just as I always did. Conventionally attractive, youthfull on the surface ( in clothes). All my best attributes still on display. Garnering attraction from hot, accomplished men. 

But I'm disgusting under the clothes. I'm not what they expected. It doesn't last because I can FEEL their repulsion. 

I know this sounds ridiculous, but I want genuine love. But I find it just as hard to accept a ""regular guy with flaws"" after my past dating experience,  just as much as men are obviously not keen on my ""regular girl with flaws"". 

For the record, i have fallen madly in love for personality, but I was still fairly attracted to him.He also broke my heart, which because I was literally perfect in behaviour, makes me think it was because of the ugly scars. 

I don't want to ""settle"", but I've not dated for 3 years becuase of my insecurity.

i wrote a note cuz that's what i do and it was 3 pages of me explaining that I DID NOT CATCH FEELINGS and that if he's not into me JUST SAY. but if he IS, be fucking HONEST. i cant handle the immaturity. this happens all the fucking time and i am just so over these types of people. but i do like him on a vibey attraction level and enjoyed the sex sort of. idk. its been a while and it WAS fun.

We have a couples counselor to help because we argue a lot, but have been together for 7 years. Anyways, during my individual session, she tells me ""I can see that you are controlling in the relationship. That is something that me and your boyfriend talked about in our last session together."" This is only my second visit with this counselor and I have only known her for 1.5 hours total. Clearly, I was very upset by this. Apparently, my boyfriend feels that he cannot freely look at other women or go out with other women because it makes me upset. Well my boyfriend and I had this big argument about it because I don't believe I am controlling. I let him go out with his friends all the time. When I call him and he is out, I just tell him to call me when he is done. And I honestly don't care because I trust him.  There was a time 3 years ago that he bluntly starred at another girl at the gas station and I know this because I could see him watch her through the passanger window. He did this to the point that he jumped when the gas pump went off. When he got back into the car, I asked him about it and he turned very red. He denied it and I told him I watched you do it. He told me that he was sorry and it was done with. Now, 3 years later, he doesn't feel like he can look at other girls? Anyways, he became very defensive and told me that it was because our counselor is a female. I denied this because why would I agree to see her if I didn't want us seeing a female counselor? I tried to explain that I felt very hurt by her comment, because didn't have a chance to explain my side of the story before she categorized me as being controlling. I was so upset that we were screaming at each other.

Birthday: I wake up, still upset about the fight. My boyfriend and I do not live together. I go to my cycling class and barely participate because I am so angry. I go buy bagel sandwiches for my boyfriend and I to have on MY birthday because he is sleeping. I call him hysterically crying and he tells me to get over it. I punch the bagels and drive home. I wait in my car at my apartment for 30 minutes. I figure that he is going to come and see me since I am so upset. BTW he only lives 7 minutes away from me. But he never came. I drive to Starbucks to get coffee. When I come back he isn't there. I think that maybe he stopped by, saw that I wasn't there and just left my gifts inside or something. I bet you can guess the answer. He didn't. I called him and he told me that he is still in bed. I called him crying at 11:45am and it is now 1pm. He has to go to work at 2pm. I talked to him, to which he said ""You are so unhappy with me so just break up with me already."" I argued that I am happy with him, but he always says this whenever we argue. I was sick of him playing victim all the time and I told him that I don't want to continue in a relationship with him due to this. I don't feel that I can forgive someone who didn't bother to check to see if I was okay after hysterically crying. Let alone, hysterically crying on my birthday.

I decided to join Feeld after hearing so many polyamory support accounts such as polyphilia recommend it consistently. 

I've been on other dating platforms - namely Okcupid, Tinder, and Facebook Dating - I ended up deleting all of them, I tried Feeld previously but it felt more or less the same experience. Most people are on it for one night stands, or what seems to be superficial connections, ""You're attractive, so I like you""

While I don't feel there's anything wrong with exploring one's sexuality and having whatever relationship - i.e FWBs, casual dates, etc... - people please for themselves. I also think it's very important for others to respect boundaries. I've had so many experiences where people ""pretend"" to be agreeable, to be on the same page as me, to respect the boundaries I've set, only to later - once i've accepted them into my home and life - attempt to have sex with me, in the recent times.

I've had 3 encounters ranging from physical force to what I call ""prevented rape"" (one hovered above me in bed in the middle of the night, I woke up, asked what he was doing &amp; why he wasn't in his guest bedroom. He told me he wanted to have sex with me. We were on my boathouse, and there are no doors between the rooms. Another one said to me, ""I can make you have sex with me if I wanted to"". I ended up sitting up and explaining to him how inappropriate that comment is, and how his adamant statement shows how insecure he really is. After a conversation, he ended up crying and apologizing. He went home, but kept coming back to my place unsolicited, sometimes even in the middle of the night).

I really want to meet new people, it's always an interesting experience and I have created and sustained lot of beautiful connections in my life that lasted many years. I want to continue making more, but I don't know how to navigate aforementioned lack of respect from others.

But I did meet a woman who was very nice looking but very evasive. By that I mean I was trying to get to know her on the first date. It was basically a one sided conversation. I'm trying to make meaningful conversation and she's giving me one word answers while playing with her food. I got a weird vibe but she did offer to pay half and I said okay because I wasn't sure it was going anywhere.

So later on in the week I called her and asked her if she wanted to meet up again. She agreed and we met for dinner but this time was even worse. It was like she didn't want to be there. After dinner we split the tab and I suggested maybe take a walk since it was a nice evening for a stroll and she said she was going to get coffee.
Meanwhile I had to use the restroom and when I came out she was gone. I'm like what the fuck? I went looking for her and she disappeared. I tried calling her and she blocked me.
I don't know what I did wrong and we are in our fifties so we aren't kids but that was just so rude.

I understand if there was no chemistry or she wasn't into me but I would have appreciated it if she told me so. I'm a big boy I can take it. And I would perfectly understand. But instead she left me hanging with no closure.

I think she’s incredible. We have the best chemistry and everybody already believes we are together as it is.

She has even said that to her friends when they have tried to set her up on dates with other people. We have discussed us dating. I’ve told her that if she wants to just stay friends then we will, no hard feelings, but that what we have right now is not sustainable, it’s not fair to us or to anybody we date. She doesn’t want things to change and I told her the only way things don’t is if we actually enter a relationship together. 

I’m willing to wait for her. I can’t see me dating somebody else, but her right now. But because she won’t tell me what she wants from me or how she feels about me does scare me.

I’ve grown out of my shyness and found that I have a great personality, but I hate that I keep being told that “I’m just a friend”. This really fucks up my depression because all I’ve ever wanted in life is to find a nice girl who I can grow old with and be a great husband for. 

I’d never hurt myself or anything, it’s just I again have zero confidence because I was just told by a girl that I really liked that “I’m a friend”.

Dating is always the same result, no matter the age, type of girl etc. Because of this railroad of ghosting and terrible experiences over the past decade I've really started to believe some pretty bad things about myself. I used to just blame my ugly looks and thought if someone gave me a chance theyd be won over by my personality. I no longer feel this way. I have started to see myself as completely and utterly flawed on both fronts.

&amp;#x200B;

How does one get out of this? I'd give up on trying to date but that would mean I am accepting complete bachelorhood for the rest of my life as no one will just appear. Each date and failed interaction scars my psyche even further. I'm almost at a point where I hate myself and I don't know how to turn that around.
