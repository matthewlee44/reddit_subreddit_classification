Don’t know if she’s into me and flirting subtly or if she’s just comfortable with me as a friend. I notice she plays a lot with her hair when she’s talking with me and gets pretty antsy. She’ll giggle at a lot of what I say and a lot of what I say isn’t THAT funny. Sometimes she’ll stand close to me at work and her eyes dilate when she looks at me. When I tease her about being anxious, she starts giggling harder and turns red. We hold eye contact. I won’t see her act the same kind of anxious way around the other coworkers, in fact she’s pretty collected. But around me, she gets more nervous. When we talk, she’ll kind of talk pretty fast. She’s open when she faces me and all and we kind of joke on each other. I mean it seems to me she might have a crush on me, but like, we’re coworkers and if I misread something it could make things weird and make the friendship weird. And to be honest, I’m not THAT good at telling when a girl has a crush on me. At least girls like her. There are the girls that bat their eyes and stuff like that, more traditional, but she’s not the kind that does stuff like that. She has emotions but finds that goofy. But anyone have an idea?

“Guys/Girls really be into you for 3 days and then be like nvm”

It was disheartening how viral both versions of this tweet went. Do people not realize that this type of situation is extremely normal in the dating scene? Dating is a trial-and-error type of process. Not everybody that expresses interest at some point or another is going to be your soulmate. Sometimes you just are not a good match and one of you realizes that after a couple of days. This sentiment gave me a huge “victim complex” type of vibe. I’m just typing this out because I feel like some people out there may need to hear it with how many shares those tweets got. Rejection is part of the game, guys. Sometimes dating sucks. The best thing you can do is have a good time and keep your hopes in check. Don’t allow your expectations to soar after a few days of getting to know someone, because that’s a perfect way to get yourself hurt.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/midrib/rejection_is_part_of_the_game/

There’s this girl in my Spanish class and I’ve barely talked to her. She’s pretty cute and I like her sense of humor, but we’ve never had a full on conversation. Besides that....

Thing is... she’s a freshman.

She’s pretty mature compared to her classmates. I just don’t know if it’s worth asking her out. My plan was to try to start a conversation with her next week at school and get to know her a little or something. Then I could ask her to the dance Thursday, the day before the dance, and see what she says.

So I have been chatting with someone for three weeks and everything was going well, but they have been dealing with their own mental health issues and recently broke up with their ex. They haven’t really been doing a good job on communicating with me and that’s something important to me because of something personal that has recently happened to me and  I’ve told them the personal issue. We have also only FaceTimed or talked on the phone when they were drunk and when they are sober I don’t hear much from them and this is causing me to get upset because I really do care for them, I don’t want them to hate me or be mad and I still want to be in contact with them. 

I just don’t know how to tell them in a nice and coming from a caring place text message  that I think they need to focus on healing from the breakup and getting on track on track with their mental health before considering talking to new people for intentions of dating.

He’s mentioned how he’s been cheated on in the past and how much that sucked so I would like to think he isn’t doing the same. I have yet to add him on any social media besides Snapchat and he’s private on all accounts. Should I be worried?!

If you want to know about my hobbies, they are the following: videogames. Watching youtube videos, practicing drawing, learning how to be a voice actor, watching anime, and listening to music.

Currently, I don't have my own house yet; I still live with my parents; I don't have a car either though I am close to getting one soon; let's see, I

Have a job, and so far, the pay rate is pretty decent, and the environment is pretty chill. Many of my coworkers are nice and friendly people, so that's

good.

Personality-wise: I'm pretty shy, anxious, friendly, quiet, and socially awkward, but aside from all those, I'm a pretty chill person in total.

Ok, that's about as much info as I'm comfortable sharing.

getting there, and the third one, um, it will probably be next year when

that will be a reality.

So here's a back story to my question: Currently I'm a high school student and I'm 18,currently on virtual learning and have one year left and I have never kissed a girl or had a girlfriend. I feel like I'm really missing out and want to experience this stuff my past friends (whom I don’t talk to anymore) tried to help me out and set me up but it never worked. I don't have friends that are girls and most I can't talk to them, but I've just 
never done/experience these two things. 





Sometimes I’m lusting over every girl I see at my job (because that’s the only time I’m out the house) HOPING for someone to say something to me a sign signal anything to get me out this hole. It’s literally a cry for help sometimes. 
Sometimes I think I shouldn’t persue women and stay to myself (and my hand) because I’m weak and don’t have the balls to protect women, because my ass of a dad (Whom I only see once I year because he “travels” and I don’t talk to him anymore) always tells me how weak I am and I can tell by the way he looks at me he doesn’t like who I am. It’s beyond impossible at this point for me, the guy who hasn’t even been to a mall with friends to talk to girls who’ve done so much but I haven’t so how could we make conversation?? 




They don’t understand me and my past of always being alone and put to the side. Most people my age have done so much with friends and Girls. I haven’t so it’s hard to talk to people sometimes, you were sneaking out the house to go smash at 16 while I was at home playing Fallout 4.

Until Wednesday, my interaction with her as been only virtually and I never had any second thought to her (but I did think she was attractive). On Wednesday, my boss organised a meeting for us and an agency to work on our corporate YouTube channel, with me in charge.

I ran late to the meeting and got drenched in rain and clothes were see-through and I make a clumsy entrance to the meeting and everyone were just laughing.

At one point, I was sitting and smirked at myself for being so drenched and unprofessional, then I catch her smirking with me. Soon, she started saying she was very passionate about YouTube as well and my boss set up a YouTube team of me and her to work on the channel as an ongoing project. 

That was Wednesday. Yesterday, I decided I had to talk to her one-on-one and set up a meeting. I was so anxious, I vaped too much in the toilets and walked straight to her.

36,mih0ly,1617356878,Online Dating Etiquette- does it even exist?!,"People, start treating people as people- how you act online will determine if they want to meet you &amp; how they think of you. I'm talking basic levels manners and small conversation- I'm not an expert, I can be very awkward &amp; I totally understand it's hard but it's necessary to be able to talk for at least a while. Here are some of the worst things you can do:

-Putting in no effort: Some conversations are dry, it won't work out or you're busy- it happens. But when you get people who will not continue a discussion (e.g. reciprocate, bring in topics to talk about etc), you don't look cool and collected, you look disinterested, boring and I'm gonna move on. You're not that hot that your bland personality can be overlooked.

- Ghosting: so this 1 is hard because sometimes I get it- if someone is being weird, creepy or offensive, it's understandable. Otherwise, it's rude. Don't disappear, say it's not gonna work, gently let someone down or at least let the conversation die. Lie if you want. 
If you're busy, that's fine just let me know- it's completely understandable. But if you say ""hi"" and leave me for a week, I'm not gonna talk to you again. It sounds mean but there are time-wasters out there.

-Being back up: essentially this guy talks to you, barely, and until his 1st choice pipes up. Maybe says ""hi, how are you"" but doesn't care to get to know you. Leaves you hanging and you'll get a response when he's horny or his 1st choice drops him. Talking to multiple people is normal and prioritising the people you click with the most is fine, just don't keep the rest on hold so you don't feel lonely when 1st choice fails.  

-Breadcrumbing: This is when you have a guy's attention for 5 minutes. They put in effort, you chat back and forth, introduce yourselves and talk about stuff maybe for a week. But then he starts to dissipate- he lurks around, says ""hey"" &amp; replies but doesn't contribute anymore. He feeds you bredcrumbs so you follow him, gives you little snippets so you think he's nice but not enough he actually has to put in effort anymore cos you're hooked.

- Creepy/fetish behaviour: for the love of all that is holy, STOP with the naked pics- if I wanted to see a virtual stranger naked, I'd look up porn. Pics &amp; sexts are exciting when a flirtship has been established. Introduce yourself, get to know them a little and what they want before launching into it otherwise it's boring. It's not a compliment to know you like a certain aspect of me- it's frankly objectifying. Don't tell me off the bat if you want to see me sleep, want to do things to me, see me naked nor spontaneously bring up if I want to help your fetish- it's bloody creepy.
I get it's hard to find people who share a fetish, maybe mention you're looking for a casual thing in your bio. Put BDSM, acronyms or emojis/flag to represent your thing to be subtle. Don't just bring it up out of the blue.
And if someone is a sexuality, race, gender don't be weird about it- they don't exist to make you horny.

- Asking for number/social media messaging straight away: if you're 1st message is this, I'm not doing it and will unmatch. Dating apps have OK messaging boards for at least a little conversation and I'm not going to give out my number to a stranger. Believe it or not but there isn't a time limit on it. If I was in a bar, you'd at least introduce yourself before asking- do the same online.

- Validation: If you feel insecure and want to know you're attractive, I get it but that's why swiping exists. If you just want to swipe for fun, maybe send pics to each other, say you're ""window shopping"" in your bio and make that known to whoever you want to talk to.

-Negging/insulting as flirting: do I really need to explain why this doesn't work? If you do this, you're an arse. For teasing, it's ok once you know them a bit or you talk about something you both agree on as a possible teasing thing (for example if they like an odd food combo that they themselves recognise as unusual) but being offensive as a joke is rarely funny and just makes you look like a dick.

- Being pushy: can't believe I need to say this but ""no"" means no. Don't try to egg me into doing something to get yourself off. If someone isn't interested in something, stop pushing them. Similarly if someone tells you they want a certain sort of relationship and you get sulky or try to push them into the relationship you want, you're a knob. Not everyone wants what you want, it's disappointing but it's disgusting to push your agenda onto another person when they clearly aren't into it.

-Being flaky: when you say you're interested/wanting something and back out or change your mind often. It's normal to have doubts but messing someone abkut back and forth or change last minute plans is so unfair on the person. If you're not interested or it's not a good time, say that. You dont need to necessarily explaim why but don't waste someone else's efforts.

I'm gonna say this is all based on actual experiences, which aren't just my own and I was surprised to see they're more common than I thought. It happens a lot that you often wonder what you're doing wrong. Im glad to know it's not just me and I haven't mentioned everything but it is quite depressing to know this goes on with so many folk. It makes you wonder how people can't even pass the lowest of standards- the bar is practically undergorund.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mih0ly/online_dating_etiquette_does_it_even_exist/

39,mihdee,1617358402,How do I stop feeling so insecure when texting girls,"I just get really insecure sometimes when I'm trying to talk to a girl over text. With one girl in particular, she says that she likes me, cares about me, and she even told me she loves talking to me. She'll seem totally interested in talking at first and she'll have so much to say, and like sending me pictures and joking around with me, and then suddenly out of nowhere she'll start giving me really dry, one word replies. Literally just like ""indeed"" or ""haha"". And then I'm over here literally just talking to myself. It's like she'll randomly jump ship and I just don't really know why. 

Whenever this happens I just start overthinking and overanalyzing everything. What did I do? Did I say something bad? Like the conversation was going really well, nothing bad seemed to happen, I thought we were both mutually having a good time. I can't help but think that she's not being truthful when she says that she loves talking to me. Me personally if I love talking to someone, I usually make an effort to talk to them? I start digging through the conversation trying to figure out where it went wrong, but I usually can't find anything of significance, so I'm just left feeling really confused and kind of hurt honestly. If I did actually do something and it was brought to my attention, I would apologize for it and try to do better. But nothing ever is, so I just don't get it. 

This kind of thing seems to happen to me really frequently and I'm just so tired of feeling confused and hurt by it. I don't even know if it's logical to feel hurt over it. I know people have lives and get busy sometimes. But I also don't get the rapid transition between talking and being friendly to dry, no effort, one word answers.

40,mihpcx,1617359921,"Old crush suddenly opened up to me, and I think I fell in love again","So about a year ago I met this girl who I got along with very well. I really liked her, and after meeting up many times I fell pretty hard for her.

She made it pretty clear she just liked me as a friend. However she was very flirty with me at times, which was very confusing. After a while I confessed my feelings because I just was so head over heels for her. I never understood how I could be so attracted to someone. She turned me down, she told me that she prefers for relationships to grow out of friendships, but that she didn’t really see me that way. At that time I could notice she felt really anxious for some reason.

This hit me pretty hard, and I spent the last months going pretty much no contact on her, trying to get over her. She really likes me as a friend though and made it clear that she doesn't want to lose me. I appreciate her too much to just let that slip. After the initial rejection she acted very hot and cold again, which made me confused.

Last week, after months of no contact (only the occasional text), we met up again.

I thought I could handle it, because I figured I was over her. Boy was I wrong.. We went out for a long walk. She suddenly told me she’s been going through some tough times with her family. She opened up about all these things all of a sudden, about how she’s really having a hard time and how her brother recently had a failed suicide attempt. She told me lots of personal things, which made it really clear to me that she’s basically been abandoned by her parents throughout her life many times.

This literally broke my heart, I was completely speechless. I feel so bad for her. I told her I’m there for her and basically just listened carefully to all these things, without saying too much. I thought this was the best thing to do in situations like this.

After I got home that evening, I felt sad and confused. I feel so bad for her. A lot of her behaviors seem to make more sense to me now (her rejecting me in an anxious way, being hot and cold all the time). I also think I completely fell in love with her again, which is stupid, but I can’t help but feel this way. 

I can’t help but think she didn’t just open up to me for no reason. I think she indirectly tried to tell me why she behaves the way she does. I have this thought in my head she actually likes me but is too afraid of intimacy. That might be wishful thinking on my side though.

I hate the fact that I fell for her again so easily. She needs me as a friend and I don't want to bother her with my feelings as well. I have to go through this emotional rollercoaster again now. This girl deserves so much better, and doesn’t even realize it.

I wish I knew what was going through her mind. I also want to know what's the best thing to do moving forward. What do you guys think about this situation?

50,mijp3g,1617367808,"He ditched plans, and lied over the fact that he wanted to hang with friends instead. What do I do?","SO just got home for spring break. He’s only home for a week, so recently I’ve been kind of dropping my own plans to compensate for time with him. Of course when he comes home, he wants to see his friends as much as he wants to which I completely get and respect. He’s seen them everyday since he’s been home. The day before, we chose to make plans once I got out of work. The next day, the day where we made plans, I get a text before I go to work saying he doesn’t feel well from the night before because he was partying with his friends and didn’t feel up to hanging with me that night. I said okay, but I felt like he was lying about it. Just being nice, I brought him some food he liked over to his house after my shift - I was just going to drop it off, no big deal. I then find out that he and his friends were in his house partying and he lied about it all. 
There are mainly 2 things that I’m frustrated with in this situation - the lying, and how recently I feel like I’ve barely been a priority, more of a convenience. I hate being lied to and I’m pretty sure he knows that. He said he did it out of fear of how I’d react to him dropping plans to hang with his buds - but heres the other thing I’m frustrated with- the fact that I haven’t been feeling like a priority lately. We had to do long distance for 2 months, and in those 2 months, I was the one planning FaceTime calls, texting. It wasn’t 1,000 texts a day where all I did was text him but I always wanted to keep talking to him so things wouldn’t become mundane. The anxiety and feelings I felt during long distance killed me because he never initiated anything until the week before we came home, and I knew he did that because he knew he was coming home to see me soon which kinda hurt. 
And now that he is home, I was so excited to see him again, I fluked on some of my own plans to go see him. I even dropped the ones I had on the night he lied. But when he wants to see me he will. I understand friends are important and are great, but where am I on his priority list? Am I simply over analyzing all of this and it’s all because he was scared of my initial reaction if he told the truth (I don’t know why he would be - he’s never seen me angry before and I’ll tell you I’m not scary when I’m upset) or does he have a lot to work on?
I see him today and we are going to talk about it. I just need to know of what to truly say, but idk what to say if it’s me or if it’s him.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mijp3g/he_ditched_plans_and_lied_over_the_fact_that_he/

52,mijvxx,1617368468,Has anyone on here ever pursued someone that they weren't interested in - but did it merely for the prospect of sex and intimacy - or merely to receive validation and attention from the opposite gender.,"I'm just wondering,  
I guess this question mainly applies to guys ; although there could be women who have felt this way before. So a scenario that I've seen my friends be in and I hate to admit that I've dodged a bullet in being, is that someone meets another person on a dating app or in a nightclub that gives them attention but they know straight away that they would never want to be in a relationship with (either because of an early red flag or because they just don't feel that attracted to them).  But they continue to pursue the person through continuing to text them and even organizing dates with them because:  
a) There is a prospect of casual sex and intimacy with them; and/or  
b) They feel like they need validation and attention from someone of the opposite gender - due to not having anyone to pursue that they actually like and are interested in.  
And usually what i've seen happen is two scenarios:  
1) They will abruptly move on from the person once they hook up with them, or meet someone they are genuinely interested in. This usually leaves the other party feeling hurt and used.  
2) Both parties will get unhealthily attached to one another and form a relationship. However, after a while this relationship will become toxic, one party will realise that they don't actually feel a spark with their partner - but won't leave the relationship because they're scared that they can't do better and that they will feel lonely. So the relationship continues - usually in these sort of relationships ; there's a lack of chemistry, both parties don't get along, there's emotional abuse, and one party is discovered to be cheating on the other.   


I'm just curious has anyone( guy or girl) ever been or been on the receiving end of such a scenario. I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mijvxx/has_anyone_on_here_ever_pursued_someone_that_they/

And I'm wondering if it has more to do with never giving myself permissions to open up sexually with  woman.  As in much of how i wish to act around women feel lime I must tamper it till a woman gives me the ""okay"" to start being more open and sexual. 


It's not that I don't want sex or to be sexual just i dont know how to  show that side without guilt  or judging how easy many people(mostly women)  can get sexual with other men.  

In every way from my pov  who can dress and act very sexual becuase its fun.  Idk why but I never really found that part fun  and Its kinda hitting me now that I might not be allowing myself to have fun with things.   Like I put  to much pressure on personity and more long term type of things people look for.
   I've noticed  the more attractive or open a woman seem to be sexually with being able to joke and just be sexually flirty and such and not put to much weight around it baffles me.  In many way I've noticed a reaction of not wanting to deal with or be around women who are ""too comforable"" with being flirty/sexual with me so easy.    And I don't know if it's more to do with the lack of being able to be sexually flirty/open with  women.    I know that  I don't feel like casual sex/dating is an option  and some part of me wants connection  yet maybe I've held on to this idea to long and wish I could be sexually open and just flirt  with women without feeling i need a reason  other  than I find her interesting enough to do so.  There tend to be a lack of enjoyment out of interactions with women, but only when the conversations get a sexual joke, flirting thrown into the mix where it goes from to people talking  to more of a man to woman interaction.   

 I just can't seem to be light hearted and have flirty banter nor let myself open sexually and feel comfortable.

Am absolutely terrified, don’t know how to do this, please help.","I want to preface by saying that yes, I know that the vast majority of the time mixed signals means that they are not interested. But there is a part of me that feels like this might be different.

We started seeing each other back in November. He was studying abroad at the time and I was in the last term of my degree. We discovered that my gap year internship happened to be in his hometown, so we ended up hooking up for two months apiece on two separate ends of the globe. Could not have been a better coincidence. We both agreed back then that we didn’t want anything serious, so we initially only met for sex. However, recently my feelings have changed and I cannot continue on like this. 

Neither of us are seeing anyone else at the moment but we both have our dating apps active. We’ve been having more sleepovers lately and he has started to tell me things about his life, his family, his past. We don’t text much, but there is equal initiation on both sides (he doesn’t start many long text conversations but neither do I, we both prefer to meet in person). Last night I went to his place and was in a really bad state, so he told me we could just order takeout and watch a movie. I don’t think he knew I was awake but before I fell asleep, I heard him whisper “you’re really something, you know” and the words have been replaying in my head ever since. 

I don’t know how to broach this topic. I’m a lot more forward and bold than he is so I know I need to be the one to broach this but I’m not used to telling a person that I have feelings for them without knowing whether he reciprocated. Should I take a more laid back approach, ask him if he wants to go on a date or something? Ask him if he’s still not looking for something serious? Or just lay it all out on the table? 

If he isn’t interested, I have to stop seeing him, right? I’m scared it’s going to hurt more. A part of me wants to say nothing so that we can continue on as is but I know it’s not enough for me.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mikken/20f_going_to_tell_my_fwb_22m_that_i_want_more/

63,mikwhj,1617371845,Dating Lessons 101: Looking for the realness,"Here are a few things I've learned in online dating if you are searching for more than a ""hook-up"" that may help others out there.

\- If someone states to you they are a ""nice person"" or ""honest"", they are in fact generally not a nice person or honest. I say this because anyone who has to convince you of their character is usually lacking in this area.

\- There are people that will talk to you day in and day out that have no intention of meeting you. If they don't want to meet after 3-4 weeks of constant conversing ( or anything less than this) I would count their loss and move on.

\- Oldie but goodie! If the person you meet is not respectful to a clerk, waiter, or other randoms in social settings that is not a nice person inside their core. 

\- If you ever got ghosted or dropped after conversing for a while and they claimed to ""connect"" or ""like"" you. Just know you were not the issue. The general reason I have witnessed is they usually have unresolved issues, self-esteem issues, or because you set boundaries and the ideal version they had of you became a bit too real. There can potentially be another person but I say good luck to that person cause they are probably next on the miss list. 

\- You will connect and have great interactions with other humans these people are not the end. 

\- No eggs in one basket because they crack love. Ensure you are still engaging with others even if you feel you've connected with someone if it doesn't work out the blow is less fatal. 

\- Assert your boundaries with force because winners don't quit and if they did they'd be winning and you wouldn't be worrying about a damn thing. 

\- Texting/phone should be the bare minimum to allowing feelings for someone without a deeper connection, memories root deep connections so those need to be made. 

\- 7.674 billion (2019) and you're a scrumptious peach, remember not everyone f\*s with peaches.

68,mim74h,1617375917,Dating in the workplace,"Hi folks,

I need some advice on the following. 

A few months ago, a new trainee joined my team. My job when it comes to her is basically reviewing her work and allocate what tasks she is supposed to be doing. We worked from home all this time but during our WFH time, we discussed about our past relationship with our exes, about marriage and kids and stuff, all of that on MS teams. She knows I broke up recently with my girlfriend and she told me she broke a month ago with her boyfriend, as well.

We went back to the office recently and the past few days we have been having lunch together, just the two of us sitting on a bench, without the rest of the team (the whole team usually goes together for lunch but her and I just go earlier than the rest). On our latest lunch, I felt that she was trying to get to know me better like asking me about my home country, family and stuff, and the conversation still went to the idea of how she wants to get married and have kids and stuff which I am all up for later down the line by the way (I told her that as well). Also, at some point during our lunch her phone rang and she didn't pick it up (she saw who it was but said ""I'll call them later"").

So long story, short we have discussed dating lives, marriage, kids, family and some other stuff like hobbies and interests and as it turns out, we have a LOT in common. Don't get me wrong, I am attracted to her but I just wanted to get some advice on this, since making a move given the current circumstances, comes with big risks. My question is: is she just trying to get to know me and just be friendly or all of those conversations that her and I had is a massive hint from her?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mim74h/dating_in_the_workplace/

We went on 5 dates over a period of 2 months plus and things have been smooth. We held hands, enjoyed each other company during our dates.

So I asked her today if she wants to be my girlfriend at the end of our date. She's hesitant and   said she can't be sure that she'll meet weekly cuz her job is busy . I reassured her that it's a give and take since we can make arrangements for that.

She can't decide. So  I said to let me know the answer by tomorrow night. I don't plan to text her until then. If she ghosts, then so be it. Can't force attraction ya? 

Did I mess up? I asked her because I  didn't want to drag too long as she seemed interested and I didn't want to invest too much over something futile.

Though, I’ve always struggled socially. I love being around people, but there’s literally nothing happening in my brain when I’m conversations. Never been diagnosed, but I wouldn’t be surprised if something is going on in my head....

I am always uncomfortable when dating/ in a relationship. Once the beginning phase is over, I just lose interest completely and prefer being alone. I have never been in love and I don’t know how to properly act when I’m with someone. I’m so used to just taking care of myself, that someone else trying to take care of me is just unsettling. 

All this to say, I know I want to be with someone, but I’m scared I’ll just end up hurting someone or being too selfish for a relationship. I desire to be loved, and to love in return, but I have never felt that with anyone. Maybe I just haven’t met the right person, but I’m also 27 and I’m starting to get really tired of the whole “don’t worry, you’ll meet the one someday!”

Please don’t recommend therapy. I’ve already tried and no useful advice has ever come from that. My parents keep making passive comments about being too picky/ having high standards. While I do have standards for myself, I don’t think they are unattainable. 

I’ve seen many failed relationships around me, and I just find that being alone makes me happier than being with someone toxic, which has been the case in the past. But I always feel lonely, and desire to be with someone. I just don’t know what to make of these emotions, and don’t know what I should be trying to do for myself.

How best to go about it? Mention now to be as up-front as possible or wait and see if the offer comes, then mention it. They are moving fast and probably want someone to start by early May. Other thoughts on how to be up-front without carpet-bombing the potential relationship?

82,minvnt,1617381019,UNPOPULAR opinion: men shouldn't pursue women anymore,"Now in the wake of corona virus meeting people has become even harder. What we had pre-covid was mostly online dating however we still met the occasionally partner at social gatherings. Well now that we have gotten sick of our smaller circles, (men/women) even the best of us has tried online dating through covid. 
   Where thats left the online dating market is a bunch of lonely desperate men swiping through 5 different dating apps a day inflating average womens self esteem making them think they are worth more than what they are. So they match with top quality guys that might respond, hell they might even sleep with you if they had nothing going on but none the less they dont value you. This has left women feeling like men are really shitty and grimy these days. I know these are over generalizations but i ask a lot of my female friends questions out of curiosity and this is what i find. They are bombarded with these same style one line pick up lines because some guys think their jobs are to amuse make girls laugh so they go out of their way to try to hard to make them laugh. Why is it like this? Well the only way to get a response from females is to have the most ridiculous message that they would be forced to reply to.... so now women are using tinder for entertainment to keep them from being bored. 
   So why should men stop pursuing women? Like i stated? Because women need their egos to be lowered, their entitlements, and the market needs to get scarcer for them like men for the playing field to level. Most women want 10 percent and wont settle. Men need to start focusing on themselves and their careers to be the value of which these women want. However once these men become of greater value they may not want you. So keep that in mind.
