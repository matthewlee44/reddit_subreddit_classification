0,o99t2u,1624842452,What is key when dealing with a guy who has a dismissive-avoidant attachment style?,"He’s been making a real effort for me, and I work hard to meet him halfway.

I know he needs a lot of space, so I give it to him. We’re still in the early stages of getting to know each other, but I’ve noticed that the times when he gets especially close by revealing some of his feelings, he pulls away immediately after. 

He has a lot of amazing qualities that make it worth it to invest in him, despite the avoidance. He’s otherwise very respectful, receptive, and is trying. I don’t want to to morph or change him into something he’s not, I just want to understand and make him feel safe and comfortable.

Really, I’m just looking to develop more compassion for him. Any and all insight is appreciated!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o99t2u/what_is_key_when_dealing_with_a_guy_who_has_a/
1,o99wm5,1624842819,Is it ever worth it to reach out?,"
It’s been a little over 3 months since we broke up (I pushed him away due to low self-esteem and communication problems) a few days after we broke up, I offered an apology and did not hear from him. I’ve been thinking about reaching out to him and talking things out. The problem is, I want to be as respectful as possible toward him. I’m moving in 2 months, and I don’t want to reconnect just to leave his life again. I understand I’m not entitled to have him back when I pushed him away. 
All I know is I have never felt (about ANYONE) the way I felt about him. Ive never found someone (friend, family, or s/o) that I connected to on such a deep level. I am living a good life now. I’m working on healing my self esteem issues etc, but i miss my ex truly. 
Here’s what I wanted to say:

Ive been thinking a lot and wanted to reach out to say if at any point now or in the future that you would like to meet up and reconnect, I am here. No pressure to respond to this. I understand my actions have consequences and I really want you to do what is best for you. 

The last thing I want is for him to feel pressure, but I also wonder if it’s best to let him be at this point",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o99wm5/is_it_ever_worth_it_to_reach_out/

3,o9aaqh,1624844327,Non American Black male in American city - I have my life (very) together but women won't even look at me (rant mainly),"I've been living in a large, west coast, US city for nearly 4 years now and i'm considering moving due to my lack of dating success here. I haven't had a single relationship since i moved here and i haven't been with anyone for 18 months now. By all accounts, i have my life together. I am turning 27; i make over 160k; well educated; nice apartment; well travelled; fluent in multiple languages; pretty tall; in good shape and; decent looking. 

What i believe is holding me back is the fact that I am black in a largely non-black city. This mainly limits my dating pool to black women (unfortunately very few where i live). Any other attention i get is from women who either 1) don't have much going on in their life/don't properly look after themselves health and cleanliness wise or 2) women who want to date me simply because i am black - and this lot is quickly disappointed because i am not the stereotypical black american male (whatever that is), mainly because i am english.

My dating attempts and (few) successes have all come from online dating. I dislike in-person approaches because of unpleasant experiences and bad energy i get from people here. It is not an issue of confidence (i think) - i am a litigator and I've had to get over nerves early on in my 20s. But, on the streets people don't even look at me in the eye when i am trying to smile at them (a common courtesy in most places i imagine). I've seen some women physically avoid walking by me. This weekend, a young woman literally jumped scared when she saw me walking beside her in broad daylight and on a very busy street. She came up to me to apologize afterwards but i was so upset by it all that i started thinking about relocating then and there. Again, this is a very large and supposedly the most progressive US city. The several times i've tried chatting up women in person have all failed and sometimes spectacularly. I don't mind being rejected, if they aren't interested then i don't really need to know why and i won't pester. But they were often dismissive and very disrespectful. Comments about my blackness came up on three memorable occasions. On top of all that, I frequently hear people saying things about me/giving me strange looks in the street or the cafe i like to work in, and even in my own office and apartment buildings. Like I am somehow not supposed to be anywhere i am supposed to be. All that to say, i am increasingly uncomfortable in these ends and that is why i don't approach women in person. 

My female friends, my workmates, and my sisters all told me that everything will work out and that i need to be patient and more proactive. Oddly enough, they all advise against online dating as apparently ""there is nothing for me there"". At this point however, i am really over it. Im highly successful in all my other pursuits but my dating track record is starting to make me feel like there is something wrong with me.  I feel like i wasted my best looking and most exciting years in a city that i madly really fell in love with when i first visited. I passed on london, nyc, and paris to be here but it is what it is at this point. Likely moving back home but also starting to consider toronto as it will be an easier transition workwise and it's a great city despite the weather. thx for reading!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o9aaqh/non_american_black_male_in_american_city_i_have/
4,o9ae7h,1624844702,Not sure if she is interested,"I met a girl a few weeks ago at a social event and we had a pretty good conversation and she suggested we should hang out and asked for my number. I took that to mean she was interested. Due to us being out of town at different points, we didn't have anything scheduled until today. Yesterday, she texted me to confirm the meeting and then followed up with that her friend might come with....that completely through me off guard. So today I grabbed coffee with her and her friend and we walked around the area and wondered into different shops. I found the situation difficult to navigate as I couldn't really escalate in any way with her friend around and it was hard to have any type of real conversation walking around stores. At times, I got the vibe it was just platonic. However, she was also openly touching me at times on the arm and at the end she hugged me and said we should grab drinks at a later date (I have no idea if that includes her friend or not). 

I am thoroughly confused about this situation. I was a bit annoyed that she invited her friend...I felt like that is something to do if you want a platonic relationship. However, that also doesn't compute in my head because as a guy, I probably wouldn't be interested in hanging out with a girl who I had no pre-existing relationship with unless I was a little bit 'interested'. I was hoping I could establish that today. 

She hasn't texted me back yet. I should probably text her something but I'm not sure if I should just ask her out to drinks or just be more direct.

6,o9af6v,1624844809,help,"So I met a guy on hinge in january but we didn’t actually start talking till march. he seemed like a really good and nice guy and our conversations were amazing. I have never been in a relationship before so when he asked me out to lunch I was very excited to go because it would be my first date. Or at least I thought so. After we met for the first time he was literally perfect he met all the boxes and treated me really nice. At first I was a little scared because he was new to my city and he had told me that he hadn’t been in a relationship in a long time because he wasn’t interested when he was in college as he was going to leave that city anyway. But he did say that his priorities changed and how we were super compatible. after literally two weeks i asked if we could be exclusive and he said 100%. The first month was amazing we were meeting up every other day he would drive me to all these places pick me up from work drop me off at home. I had my first kiss with him but I did tell him that I wanted to wait until we had sex because i had Never done it before and I wanted to wait. He was very nice about that too And I thought I was actually going to fall in love with him because of how respectful he treated me. Everything changed when one day a few weeks later he got an amazing job offer five hours away it was his dream job when he told me he genuinely seemed really upset and said he wanted to try a lo distance because he really liked me And he wasn’t moving for a couple of months.He seemed really genuine about his feelings so even though I didn’t really want to try long distance I said yes and that we will cross the bridge when it comes to it. more time goes by and we were doing fine until one day i asked if we could make things official and he said what was the hurry. it had only been about a month so i told myself to wait. around the second month he got the news that he would have to leave at the end of the month because of his lease and that changed everything. he seemed a little distant, still wanted to make out and dry hump me but didn’t want to do other couple stuff, didn’t want to take pictures with me, texted dry but still wanted me to come over all the time. i felt really weird so i asked him again if we could make things official and he said “he doesn’t want to put labels on things because he’s pessimistic about us working out with the distance and our schedules and it would just hurt more if we were official” i lost my shit then cause that just seemed like such bs to me. i told him that he had said before how he was gonna try his best to make us work and he just kept saying that if things are uncertain he doesn’t want to “date”. i felt like someone had stabbed me cause i was starting to fall in love with him. he kept saying how he’s sure about me but not the situation bla bla and if he wasn’t moving he definitely would’ve asked me out by now. my world just collapsed, if we weren’t datint this whole time then what the fuck were we doing. i literally opened up to him like no one else and i was convinced that we were together especially since he told me we were exclusive and i was literally making out with him and going on dates but apparently these weren’t even dates to him. i got really mad and he just said that he wanted to call things off and i agreed. im heartbroken and don’t know what to do. i feel so stupid cause i was under the impression we were together and now he’s making me feel like its my fault for assuming that. we’re over now but i just need someone to tell me if this is normal or not cause im going insane. please help",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o9af6v/help/
7,o9aict,1624845145,Why are some preferences heavily criticized here?,"It seems to be a universally accepted fact that most people have dating preferences and they’re normal to have. However, when women on this subreddit post expressing any sort of physical preference, they often get comments with the undertone of “yikes you’re shallow.” 

Several threads on height preferences and one I saw the other day regarding a woman that wanted men without facial hair. 

If a woman posts on this subreddit saying she thinks 5’9 men are short, she’ll be inundated with messages on how shallow she is. The average American man is 5’9, does anyone here genuinely prefer anyone that’s truly *average*?  I’d assume if men said they didn’t want a woman that weighs 170lbs and is 5’4 (the stats of the average American woman), people here wouldn’t shame them for not being into bigger women.

This girl clearly wanted sex but made it a point to let me know that she wanted to wait until we were older.

I was completely cool with this as I wanted to just date her normally and find out where it goes. As time went on though it was clear that she wanted me to be more assertive and get sexual with her. And ironically even more so she wanted me to break her rule that she told me about wanting to wait because anytime sex was brought up she would get so angry for the fact that I wasn't trying even though she said she wanted to wait

Looking back it was so idiotic for me just to act so stupid and wait because I was trying to be loving and respectful but clearly that was not turning her on.

This girl reopened every single insecurity I thought I got over by the time I met her

I finally thought I would be okay being a sensitive nerdy big tall black man until I met her.

But something that I really regret is the fact that I still haven't virtually no sexual experience

By the time we both met each other again years later she was able to go on and sleep with 10 men.

Throughout all that time I was struggling trying to get over her abuse while trying to date again and I had nothing but failures

It makes me very bitter and I never wanted to coerce a woman into sex especially if she wasn't comfortable but looking back I wish I would have pressed for sex more

Throughout all that abuse at least I could have gotten some type of experience out of that to further use in my future interactions.

All that struggling I did in college probably wouldn't have existed if I had some bases and what to do with a woman in bed.

So me (27f) and boyfriend (28M) have been dating for few months and everything has been going really good. We both have gone through a lot and usually we both try to think from eachothers point of view. But since recently I have been having this nagging feeling about something from his past. Before me he has had fwb relationships and casually dated people. And I was the only relationship he had after 4 years of him casually dating and having fwb only relationships. Most of these girls has become good friends with him after they ended those relationships and two of them he considered as really good friends and still texts with them occasionally. Before I actually didnt care because those relationships didn’t involve any romantic feelings and they also had moved on have relationships. And they know about me even though we haven’t met. One of those girls who lives in his hometown ( we are currently pursuing our post graduate studies so we live in another city) recently went through a breakup. My bf is going back to his hometown for summer and I cant join because I have other obligations. Today he said he is going to hangout with this girl and suddenly this nagging feeling came out of no where. I trust him and I know he only consider her as a really good friend. And even my rational mind says its so stupid to get this nagging feeling because I know him. But is it okey to have this feeling. She is his friend and its stupid to ask him not to hang out with her just because of my nagging feeling.

We first messaged through a dating app in February. I told him that I was looking for a FWB-type situation (but I was open to dating, didn’t disclose because I have problems with vulnerability). We would not be able to meet until he was fully COVID immunized. 

He was out of my mind until he notified me that he got his second dose at the end of May. For the next 3ish weeks, I thought about him obsessively…it was not healthy.

So we finally met a couple of days ago and he was awesome. I wasn’t having a good day, and I feel like I completely whiffed my first impression. The sex was amazing, but when it came to conversation, I had no confidence in my words. I feel like he’s just so much more…advanced than I am, in many aspects of life. I was dumbfounded the entire time and I came across as an idiot. 

After we had sex, we were lying on his bed and I asked him if he’d be interested in hooking up again. He admitted that casual sex doesn’t satisfy him. Once you have sex with someone you love, it just doesn’t feel the same. Makes sense, but it fucking hurt. Casual sex probably isn’t for me, either. 

I shot myself further in the foot by saying I didn’t want to be in a relationship so young, which probably shutdown any chance I may have had to meet him again, IF he is interested in me in that way.

It’s really frustrating because I genuinely have feelings for him, and I feel like he will never see me in a romantic way. I want to make it clear to him that I don’t find him too old for me. However making that clear is insanely difficult. I’m not concerned he’s out of my league or anything, it’s just the age I want to get past. 

Any advice ?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o9ccbh/im_19f_crushing_on_my_coworker_30m/

Hi guys. My cousin (24) likes my bf (21) (she says he is like a little bro to me) i know that from the way she speaks to him and how she acts around him (desperate). Also my cousin is mean to me and would joke mean things about me every time we see each other, i ignore her tho. I told this to my bf and how it gives me trauma and scares me &amp; what upsets me is that my bf left me when i told him all of my probs (issue with my cousin) and he was willing to help. He said he’ll ignore her as much as possible. If he was willing to ignore my cousin as he said then why did he leave? Also, I forgot his birthday this year when my cousin thing bothered me to hell, we’ve even had a convo that i should go to therapy. He said he will take me and all. I get that i forgot his birthday and he has every right to be upset but idk why he did this all of a sudden esp after i was vulnerable to him &amp; he promises to be there for me. I understand that it might be hard for him to have a gf who has heavy emotional baggage. I wonder if things would’ve been different if he &amp; my cousin didn’t meet. If things would’ve been different if I wasn’t vulnerable to him. He made me feel so safe and left. This is the first big issue/challenge that we faced during 1.5 years of being together. On top of it, he gets angry &amp; ignores me as if it’s my fault that we broke up. I texted him millions of text to talk things out and even called him, he didn’t say anything and cuts the call after i talk about getting back together &amp; resolve things. I wish he was a little understanding of my situation. I thought he cared. He is suddenly so rude too. We broke up like 2 weeks back and he acts like he is not hurt. I just can’t process this.

I do not want to cause drama or have it interfere with my job, but as it is a crush, I am having a lot of trouble doing so. The worst part of it is, we've barely talked. It started because he came up to me and just gave me this intense, oddly intimate stare for two seconds in silence before asking a question and for some reason my dumb female brain cant get over it. It's the worst. I dont know what to do because the other girls I work with have told me it's totally attainable and to ask him out, which has only made it a bazillion times worse. Instead of it being a distant attraction I am now thinking of this actually working out which is NOT good. I dont know what to do. It doesnt help that I cant even tell if he likes me. Half of the time I talk to him he seems annoyed and the other half he is agreeable and generally friendly but we havent ever had one real conversation. I've only worked there for a month or so which makes this all worse because I love this job and I dont want anything to disrupt it.

What do I do? I asked one of the bartenders for his age thinking it would deter me but I have no problem dating someone who is 24. Its not enough to convince my emotional brain that it's not appropriate or possible. Help. How do I stop? I havent had a crush in a long time cause I always shoot my shot before I develop any sort of feelings but obviously that is not possible here. Too much at risk.

I'm kind of old to find out (21m) and only my family and closest friends know I have it. I always dealt with it myself and even though I thought something was wrong. I asked my really close friend if he could tell I had this condition before I told him and he said he didn't know at all because I don't open up a lot.

I was thinking about it and I know he has not seen me acting that way but a relationship would. I already have bad anxiety and telling new people this, especially dates would be too much. I have the dating apps because I want to find someone but I am scared to disclose the issues. I feel like they wouldn't know unless I told them but another part of me thinks that I should tell them so it doesn't end up a huge surprise if we keep talking. 

I really don't know what the best choice is because I feel like if I disclose my condition they'll not want to see me in the future. But I also feel like maybe they wouldn't care.

No matter what i do. no matter how hard I try, no matter how many different advices I try, I always get the same result. Zero likes, zero matches, zero messages, zero everything. I am giving up now and considering killing myself. I have tried and tried and tried with everything I could try for the last 6 years since I was 18 and got my face stomped into the ground by these dating apps. I went to the gym, took steroids, built up a male model's body with a ripped six pack, im 6'1 tall, I have a low hairline with thick hair, I got professional pictures taken by a photographer so ive done everything possible. Im completely invisible to every single girl on the apps. Ive swiped and swiped and swiped, and swiped some more but still just silence..... I guess my face is just so horrendously ugly that no amount of effort can free me from this. Ill be alone for the rest of my life. Today for the second time in my adult life I cried, as a grown ass man. I cried until I ran out of tears this time, like a little kid. Also There is no chance of me being able to meet in person because I have also tried that and ended up getting laughed at, told to fuck off, and it was just so awful that I still regularly have nightmares about it. Why are people so cruel? I just dont understand what I did to deserve this. Why am I so worthless? What did I do wrong? Whats wrong with me? Nobody can seem to pinpoint it. Ive submitted my pictures to r/rateme and r/amiugly and photofeeler and nobody called me ugly. They said I was probably above average looking, photofeeler gave me a 90% rating. I have relied on only dating apps because Im just not brave enough to approach strangers. I cant do it. Ive tried drinking liquor to the point that I see stars hoping that it will help make it easier, but I still just cant do it!

There is no hope of escape and now im becoming old. My entire early 20s is lost now, and I have nothing to show for it, ZERO! And I was trying constantly the entire 6 years, without taking any breaks. Can you imagine failing that badly? Now my family is asking me if im going to get married or why I havent met anyone yet. You know what, I think Im going to go ahead and kill myself now. Yup, ive tried enough and I think its time for me to go ahead an check out. Im not going to live the rest of my life like this.

To be fair to me, I lost my virginity to her (hopefully without her knowing since I didn’t tell her), I was amazed at how close of a connection we had, and I was so hopeful for the future and the things we were planning. We even went skydiving together and I think that brought us closer but throughout the whole thing I remember thinking that this would never workout bc she was never really available or seemed down for a relationship, but I stupidly ignored that. It lasted like 3-4 months and the funny part is that we had gone on one date a whole year before snd we reconnected on tinder, and in my head I was like “oh this is meant to be.”

She was a lot of my firsts, and I had a thing with a girl before but i was too afraid to do anything with her lol, and the most we did was hold hands. Embarrassingly enough I was a freshmen in college when this happened and so this gikr that I’m talking about was my first ever real “thing”. 

I finally got over my fear of making a move snd she made me comfortable with physical intimacy, and I remember we would just cuddle and stare into each other’s eyes and massage each other. I remember anxiously caressing her and it probably got annoying to her, but she also made me feel desirable bc she didn’t hold back when we were kissing or doing whatever. Before her I would shake at the thought of kissing a girl and I was just afraid of intimacy. 

The day after I introduced her to my friends she broke things off bc she said she didn’t want to lead me on into thinking she wanted something serious snd basically broke things off saying she realized she wasn’t ready for a relationship. I was devastated for a couple days but surprisingly felt fine after like a week. I remember going out to a club and dancing with a girl that week feeling like I was the man.

I even slept with a different girl the week after that and I remember feeling sad that I didn’t have the same connection that I had with the first girl. After that I haven’t really shot my shot anymore and I sort of just take whatever comes to me which is light flirting, getting girls social media’s, but nothing ever progresses further.

The worst thing is that I feel like I lost my swagger after that and I find myself thinking about her when I’m lonely, even after 3-4 months. I know it’s a confidence thing bc when I was seeing her, I felt like a ladies man bc i quite literally didn’t care what girls thought of me and therefore could better flirt with other girls. I don’t know how to build myself back up snd im trying to you know do the whole workout thing but I have injuries on both my shoulder and knee so Im just doing rehab constantly.

How do I get out of this rut? I’ve gotten some success since then but it’s mostly been on night outs where I talk to a girl, maybe there’s flirting involved and we’ll exchange social media’s, but nothing ever comes from any of it. 

There was this girl at my old work who I felt like gave me that butterfly feeling, but I didn’t want to ask her out since she was a coworker but also bc I didn’t want to risk making anything awkward. 

I’m honestly thinking of asking one of my female friends who works there to ask for her social media for me but I feel like if it’s meant to be it’s meant to be.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o9eb4g/im_still_hurt_about_girl_that_ended_things_with/

His excuse was he was too tired but I can’t help but feel like that wasn’t true. Before telling me he was tired he was asking me if we would fool around once he got here. I said no we barely know each other I want us to at least hang for a while before we go at it. He insist that he wants more from me than just that but he’s been pretty quite ever since I said no. I’m just baffled by his behavior because when I say this guy is attractive I mean gorgeous 9/10 model status why is he so pressed for sex? I would get if  we had been talking for a while but it has literally been a few days. Does he not have anything else to offer? Is that all he’s interested in ? And if that’s the case why not have sex with one of the many women who are open and willing ? Why lie about it? Why waste both of our time? He still text me sporadically but I have no idea what his deal is. I’m pretty disappointed",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o9efhn/i_just_dont_understand/
63,o9eiew,1624861494,To men who don't get dates,"(This is a post was inspired by someone's vent) 

You will be alright. Please stop worrying. Don't chase the relationship, but rather work on attracting it by not caring so much about having one or not. 

Be you, be kind, be open to new things, don't slouch and be polite. 

You don't need your own house or your own car in order to get the right person by your side. And why would you want someone who prefers you just because you own things?! As long as you are ambitious, have goals and work on achieving them, you will attract the right person.

If you like someone, ask them once. If they say yes, then great! If they say no, go about your day as if nothing happened. 

Set your standards. May I suggest avoing people who are oriented towards materialistic things? Holding someone's hand or taking walks, greeting them with a smile on your face and offering them moral support is always better than paying for their stuff.

Sorry to say it, but if women only pick the people at the finish line, they don't deserve them. Relationships are a marathon run by both parties. Don't forget that. Both should put in the work and the means. 

Do your thing and learn how to be alone until the right one comes along. 

It's never about looks, it's all about attitude.

Now I know that most people still find others attractive even when in relationships. It is not the same for me. I only find the person I'm attached to attractive.

And honestly being with someone who does find other people attractive ,be it straight or bi men , is an absolute turn off.

Now keep in mind that I'm not completely writing them off but it does kind of make me uncomfortable.

Am I wrong for feeling this way? I was called biphobic for not wanting to date bi men but I've noticed that bi people come with a lot of baggage:

 Feeling that they should date the same gender to be adequately bi even when in a relationship, 
 missing the same gender and I know that this is just as applicable to straight people except they only look at the opposite gender.

And honestly I get it,I get that there are a lot beautiful people in the world and people will look. But that makes me feel like I'm replaceable. 

When I won't look at anyone else if I were in a relationship,I certainly don't want my partner to not afford me the same respect.

70,o9f317,1624864235,I saw this really cute girl on vacation…,"Hi there, this might be a rather long post so I apologize in advance. 

My family and I (20 y/o M) are heading to Colorado to visit my grandma. We’re originally from South Dakota and have a cabin that is 5/6ish hours from where we live. Also, it is pretty much in the direction we needed to go. We figured that we’d stay a couple days at our cabin before heading to Colorado. 

So, we’ve been here for a few days and tomorrow we leave for CO. today me and my family had dinner at this 50s themed diner and I saw a really cute girl who was a worker there. I guess you can call her a “waitress,” but the way the restaurant was set up was that you order ahead and then they bring the food out. Anyways, my dad and I walk in there and boom there was that really cute girl taking orders. While my dad and i were trying to figure out orders for the family, the girl and I kept making eye contact. Then it was our turn to order. She was polite and took our order, but we still kept making eye contact. she then started to fumble with her words and dropped our order number and awkwardly started to laugh at herself. I laughed with her but then thanked her for taking our order. 

Now i’m seated with my family and we’re waiting on our food. the cute girl and I continue to make eye contact, but i try and limit it so i don’t seem like a creep. but then she starts to act funny. She starts acting all goofy and dancing all while looking at me. she then starts bussing tables near where i’m seated. At one point, she stopped her friend and whispered something and i could see the other girl turn around and look at me. I’m sure you get the point, we’re interested in each other… at least i hope? 

our food comes out and she periodically checks in with my family and I to ensure that we have everything that we need. I was originally gonna make a move and ask her for her # after we finished eating but i didn’t. She thanked us for coming in and told us to have a nice day. I walked right by her and smiled, but held back on asking her for her #. I always opt out last minute when it comes to asking girls for their numbers as I am reserved and socially awkward. although this time, i got this feeling of bravery and that i was determined on talking to this girl…but i blew it. Another thing that held me back was the fact that I don’t live in the town where she works at. The only thing out there is our cabin. 

As a 20 year old male who has been in several relationships, I never thought i’d be constantly thinking about this girl and the situation i’m in rn. However, this girl really grabbed my attention. She behaves in a manner that i do at times and seemed really fun to be around. i’m not saying that she is gonna be the love of my life or anything like that, but i really want to get to know her. idk maybe i’m just crazy.

oh and here’s another thing. once my family and i are finished visiting our grandma, we will comeback to our cabin again and spend a few more days before heading back home. so, my question is, should I make some excuse to go back and eat at that diner again, even if i’m by myself, so i can truly make a move with that girl? or, should i just act like my age and move on? If I do end up going back to the diner, should i just write a note with my number on it for her or should i try and catch her attention? 

The only time i’ll be at our cabin is later in the month with my dad.

As i’m reading this i feel absolutely ridiculous, but i keeping telling myself that i’m young and that i should be brave and just go for it. I mean to be honest, if she isn’t interested in me it’s not gonna be the end of the world, but i’d rather have tried than not.

I'm a critical overthinker who overanalyzes everything and gets paranoid.

Quick backstory, we had class together this past semester and I saw her look at my IG story before she had followed me or we even really interreacted in class. A day later I messaged her privately on zoom and said we should keep in touch over the summer. She said she agrees and we exchanged info. We found out that we live like 30 seconds from each other. We texted for a bit, we have hung out twice, and we've talked quite a bit via text. I didn't start talking to her with the intent on becoming anything serious but as I've got to know her more I've kind of started to like her as more than a friend, and I kind of want to ask her on a real date. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had messaged her a few days ago because it was her birthday. The reply I got made me wonder if perhaps **she's reminding me that we aren't going to be anything more or if it's just a natural progression in the timeline of things.** 

I had sent her ""Hey Happy Birthday, I hope you're having a dope day today. I'm really happy we met, and I can't wait to see you again."" The reply I got was ""Awww, Thank you so much (KotaIbushuBIGTIME), that's so thoughtful of you. I'm glad I've made a friend like you, it means a lot. Good people that you can just vibe with is harder to find as we get older. Let's do something this week?""   


The overthinker in me says ""she is telling you that you are friends and you can not be anything more with her,"" but one of my friends had said ""You have to become friends with someone before you can ever date someone seriously, like yeah Tinder and stuff exists but it would be strange in this situation to just go on a date before anything else.""   


I think regardless, I'm going to ask her if she wants to go on a date and if she says no thank, whatever no hard feelings I'm fine remaining friends. Related to that, I could also use some advice on how to ask her on a date if I'm doing that...is it like a ""Hey, what are you doing this weekend?

So to address my question, what am I (m20) doing wrong? As far as I can work out, I’ve been serious with 5 women.  Three left me for someone else(one for a roommate and good friend) and one left because someone spread false rumors about me. The other girl and I mutually split.

&amp;#x200B;

I think of myself as a shy person, suffered from depression during pandemic because I was alone and was thinking I will be single my whole life. Worked on my way of talking and how I am as a person but I am a little on the perfectionist side and felt like I am not near social enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I was hiking with some cousins and while we had a break I thought it's a good idea to ask strangers how long is until the top, how are they doing and so on. At some point 2 girls come near and I start to talk to them, gave them some advice and recommend them a break if the feel tired. They continue the trip and after 10 min my group departs as well. Was thinking if would met one of them again, she seemed pretty nice. After 10 minutes I see them taking a break, we took one as well, started talking, they even offered me a place to sit on the blankets they use ( really nice girls). Out group continued together, we talked a lot on our way down, similar interests, we both work in IT, my problems to better manage my tasks and extra work and become a freelancer are problems she just solved and she want's to get into stocks which I am already there. We like to do sports, like to travel. Exchanged instagram to continue to talk (this was on Sunday). We left the mountains because we needed to go to a city that is 2h away and not the one near where she stays at 30min. We talked on that night, she asked me if I arrived (liked that). 

&amp;#x200B;

Continue to talk a little everyday, things go good, at some point I was outdoor walking at night to have some exercise and ask her for the phone number and talk to her on phone for almost 1h. Yesterday she message me first and we talk a little again. 

&amp;#x200B;

The downside we both live and the biggest cities after the capital at 4h away. But I have a car she has a motorcycle and we can work remote from anywhere. I like talking to her and want to ask her if she will be in the city in the coming weekends because I want to see her. 1 of my cousins is living there so I could have where to stay just in case. I really hope things will go well and not just be simple friends, I feel she is a nice person and someone whom can motivate me in doing more.

He makes a lot of jokes and comments that are funny and I have a good laugh now and then.

The thing is, I can't decipher whether he is just a nice and friendly guy that likes to hang out as friends or if there's interest from his side. He is very friendly in person and in text, and very talkative. 

The thing is I have kind of bad self confidence and I never believe guys are interested in me.

We laughed about some stuff and I found a way to smoothly redirect our conversation into the date some time later next week. Then I get this: ""You're gonna have to try way harder to impress me before I go out on a date with you"".

That threw me off tbh and I didn't know what to say next. As a guy that respects himself, wtf do you even say to that? Lol 

So I made a joke of how she puts people on the spot (now I feel like I shouldn't have done that, but the situation asked for it tbh. I'd have more regrets if I didn't say it), then I go on saying that I don't see the point in trying to impress anyone over text, since that would make me put on a facade and make me someone I'm not. Then I apologized hoping she would not take it personally... She did take it personally afterall. Next thing I see is me getting unmatched lol no further conversation, nothing... Either my way or highway kind of situation I feel like. 

""Entertain me, you peasant/clown""

 I prefer getting to know people irl, since it works best for me anyways vs doing it online, unless it's someone, who's continents away... I feel like the only people I should really try and impress are the employers, unless I simply feel emotions towards that other person.

Maybe I'm wrong tho. But I did find it toxic.

So my questions are:
1) what the hell did I miss in the last decades that made girls like that, that the majority of them now think that guys should bend over and twist from the inside out before even meeting them, over text, in order for them to be approved for the potential chance to maybe get an improbable date?! Isn't the whole point of a date is to try and get to know a person?
2) Am I the only one who thinks that technology hinders the ability to meet people IRL, something like two complete strangers starting up a random conversation that could lead to a date? Don't get me wrong, I like technology, except when it comes down to dating.

I feel like I must then change my opinion, I have to be with them because I'm missing out on something great if I don't. That the love of my life could be one of them but I will miss it because I'm not ready, or enoughly attracted or closed up.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o9hhc6/im_emotionally_unavailable_or_at_least_im_pretty/

94,o9ijgw,1624880535,Do men think about you after they tell you they no longer want to date you?,"I (22F) have just been dumped by a guy (26M) due to too much ‘drama’ after having a huge fall out about someone telling me something I didn’t like and I pulled him up on it. Everything was fine before that, he was on his way to my flat and i brought it up on the phone call, we argued and I told him to turn back. He text the next day saying to finish it because of too much drama. He hasn’t text me at all since… I was expecting him to and he unliked my Instagram pictures lol (childish, I know). Do you think he has just completely turned his feelings off or is he just angry? Do you think he is thinking about me at all? I think about him every day and I may or may not have sent him a drunk text which he did not respond to. I would respond to anything he texted me??",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o9ijgw/do_men_think_about_you_after_they_tell_you_they/
95,o9in1e,1624880935,I can’t seem to get any date with a girl.,"Hi, A bit of context:

I am 35 years old living in Italy and have dated 1 girl for 1 year in my entire life. I just feel that I am completely undateble. I don’t know how to approach anyone or even the fact that I don’t even feel motivated. I feel so alone and at times just feel so horrible. The nights are especially bad since I live alone. 
It’s not that I don’t have friends. I have some and one especially close one but I just don’t seem to be able to date. 

It’s worse because I don’t think I am bad looking. I do have a bit of tummy.  But sometimes I just feel that I am invisible because of how I look. I am not even very selective. 

Because of all this, I really stay awake and stressed at night. Do I have any future? I am not getting any younger.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o9in1e/i_cant_seem_to_get_any_date_with_a_girl/
96,o9iwo4,1624881961,How do I make it clear it's a date?,"I'm thinking about asking out a classmate of mine and I was wondering, how can I do it making it clear that it's not just a casual hang-out, which she might think since we're already kinda friends? I'd like to send a very clear message since I wanna make sure, in case she accepts, that she does so because she is actually intersted in me not just because she thinks she's gonna hang out with a friend. Also, there is no word for ""date"" in my language or rather, there is, but it's not really used. Any suggestions?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/o9iwo4/how_do_i_make_it_clear_its_a_date/

99,o9j7eq,1624883136,I [22 M] feel like I’m in limbo with the girl I like [F23],"Met her in 2017 and went on a date. It went well minus a failed attempt at a hug, she didn’t feel comfortable and revealed later that she didn’t really enjoy being touched by anyone but the closest people. Fine with it, understand. She agreed to a second but had some mental health problems she had to deal with. I saw her on tinder in 2020 and decided to follow her Instagram. Learned she had borderline and bipolar disorder. She told me texting can be mentally draining sometimes and I usually got answers back after a day or so. I tried playing it cool and just messaged her every other day.

We talked and hit it off pretty well. Sharing common questions, chatting about a variety of things and sorta just getting to know her. She told me she was gonna be moving up north for a bit but would be back in the fall.

We met at a park and had a small outing before she had to go home to pack. It was wonderful and we lost track of time noticing she had 5 minutes to get home but lives further out than that. She gets excited and says she wants to see me when she gets back down for a visit.

Conversation inbetween the next time we saw eachother was limited and mostly through Instagram. I caught Covid and was possibly not going to make it. I said “fuck it” and messaged her that I had a huge crush on her and she asked me to call her. I couldn’t because I was rushed to hospital.  But I updated her and she got really happy that I was updating her and that she wanted to see me even more.

Some awkward small talk on Instagram for a month &amp; texts. Kinda hard to do long conversations with someone who gets burnt pretty fast, and someone who is 3 hours away.

But I really like them. She makes me happy. I asked her this past Friday if she was coming down so I could see her. She said she was actually coming down and would love to see me 8:30-9:30.

We meet at the same small park and go on a walk around it’s teeny perimeter. The first 5 minutes are a smooth conversation and catch-up. We talk lots. Conversation is kinda awkward with pausing in between but it’s fine in my opinion. We go to a waterfall and I try a silly and not gross pickup line.

“My hands are cold even in the summer, would you help warm them up?” 
Every girl from my past? It worked. Her reaction was confusion for a moment and then 
“No, sorry”

I say “can’t blame me for trying”
Awkwardness. 

A few minutes later she said she had to be home to see her sister before she goes to stay with her boyfriend a few cities away. I say “no problem”

Look down at my watched. 8:55. 

She left really early and asked that i text her when I get home. Okay. I got a little buzzed that night and texted her:

“Hey, thanks for a great time, sorry I made it weird for trying to hold your hand. Hyped to see you again.” 

No reply. Not uncommon. Sometimes she doesn’t reply cuz she can’t handle much conversation as mentioned. But man do I regret sending that text.

She’s viewing my stories on social media. Orbiting.

Was I just boring / there was no chemistry? Does she just want to be friends, or was she just not down to hold hands?
Is it over?
Is it redeemable?
Am I just overthinking?
Do I message her or was a hint given she was not interested?

So many questions on my mind. Did I fuck up? Where do I go from here.

Over analyzing a lot, but this is important to me. Never stopped thinking about her and what could have been. Really want this to work out.
