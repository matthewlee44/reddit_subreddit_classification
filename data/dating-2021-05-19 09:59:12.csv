3,ng8qnx,1621437828,Need advice: Is this an appropriate letter to write a person I've been dating for a couple weeks?,"Hey Reddit,

 I(32m) have been seeing an incredibly wonderful woman (29f) over the last few weeks. Since I've been single for the last 1.5 years, she's the first person I actually feel butterflies with. With that in mind, and seeing as to how I hadn't dated for almost 8 years before this bout of being single, I actually have no idea how to navigate the situation and could really use a hand. Basically, I'm wondering if giving her this hand-written letter for her to read on her flight to Texas this weekend is ""too much"" for where we currently are.

**Basic info**

- We've been talking for a couple of weeks and have seen each other 4 times.
- Slept together twice – literally slept together. We've only made out so far.
- Other than some short things here and there, she's been mostly single for the last 3 years. Her last relationship was 5 years long and ended because he cheated on her.
- (Not sure if it matters, but it could so Im adding it)  She's not only incredibly kind, funny, curious, and intelligent, but is also drop dead gorgeous. I'm fairly certain she could get any guy she wants. I like to think I'm a decent catch too, but the jury is still out on that one.

**The letter** 

Hey short stack (A bit of an inside joke since she is 5' 9""),

I just wanted to write you a hopefully short letter to send you on your merry way to the Lone Star state.

Over the last year, I’ve dated quite a few really extraordinary women that I really wanted to be excited about dating but simply couldn’t be. It got so bad at one point that I began to question whether I even had the capacity to be vulnerable any more and wondered whether 2019 had somehow damaged me for good emotionally.

But as we’ve been talking, I’ve noticed a shift in things. 

One example is when I hear my text tone: instead of feeling a slight sense of dread as I normally would, I find myself being excited in hopes the text is from you, and when it is from you, I can’t help but smile and try not to open it immediately so I have something to look forward to.

Basically, I guess I’m trying to say, I’ve enjoyed every moment of getting to know you so far, and even if this doesn’t work out between us, I’m still incredibly encouraged by the experience. While it may have thrust me into completely unfamiliar territory that I have absolutely no idea how to navigate, it’s still shown me that I do have the capacity to be vulnerable and that the walls I have up are only as tall as they need to be to get me where I need to be.

That’s all! This ended up being longer than I initially intended and I hope it doesn’t cause you to run for the Hills haha. Otherwise, fly safe and have so much fun in Austin! If you don’t meet some strapping young red neck that blows your socks off while you’re there, Penny Boy and I will be really looking forward to seeing you and Bodhi again when you get back. 

Take care, 
MyFeetLookLikeHands

4,ng921g,1621438593,He (m30) went on a week long vacation with his ex and didn’t disclose that to me (f28),"This is probably better-suited here: 

A month into us dating, we had a big conversation about how much I value communication. (I wasn’t getting it at the time). We said we both have a pattern of jumping into relationships too fast. I said I wanna take my time. He agreed and said he’d tell me when he wants to move forward and is looking for a life partner. He said the only other person he was dating was an ex. I was dating others as well but only very casual. We both said what we expect from each other is honesty and respect.
We’d been dating two months and I felt we were good friends getting closer. I decided to put my trust in him because of how stable he seemed and how willing he was to have this conversation. I didn’t pry or ask too many questions about his dating life. I trusted he’d tell me what I needed to know.
The day before his week long trip he sleeps over at mine and has told me the whole time he’s going on a trip w a guy friend and a female friend.
He then comes back, we have raw sex. He cums in me after I asked him not to. One week later he says his ex wants him back so he can’t do this anymore. We stumble upon him telling me this week long vacation was with his ex. He says I’m the best sex he’s had and I feel like his best friend.
I feel completely played. I cried to him and told him he forced a level of intimacy on me that I didn’t want and intentionally kept me in the dark.
He was super remorseful and said he was honest as much as he could have been. He said he still has deep feelings for me. He’s still with this other girl.

What can I do to prevent this from happening again?? I trust too much but I know I can’t date without trusting anyone. Or can I?

Was he wrong for not disclosing this??

2) I dated a public defender who’s life was similar to the doctor’s.  Saturday night was her spent answering very urgent emails / phone calls.  She was constantly stressed out.

Both of these women had little personality outside of their very high salary professions.  It was cool telling my friends I’m dating a lawyer, but I mean... who cares.  That’s her money / status and not mine.  Who cares if she drives a new lexus.

The biggest struggle lately is that I don't particularly want to date women with kids. I've been in 3 relationships with women with children and those 3 relationships are the worst relationships I've ever been in. The one I just got out of in particular. It was so insanely stressful that it gave me a mild case of PTSD. It's been 3 months and I'm still fucked up from it a little. 

However, 99% of the women I meet or match with on dating apps have children. It is very difficult to find women close to my age that are without kids. And after this last relationship the thought of even dating a woman with children spikes my anxiety A LOT. 

Did any of you out there that don't want children find your childless partner this late in life? Should I just give up hope finding one and try to make it work with single parents?

I met this woman (who is one year older than me IF that matters) in one of my college classes. Ill be honest I’m pretty bad at dating and I tend to be the type of guy who goes to work, studies all day, and I generally don’t have much time for relationships. I asked this girl out, fully knowing this. The first date went extremely well and I am pretty sure we both had a great time. She made it pretty clear that she wants me to meet her friends and roommates and we both want to get to know each other better and go on more dates.

The problem: We both had to move away from the college we go to for a couple of weeks to visit family. This happened shortly after our first date. During this time we snap a bit and talk, its all good. But very quickly, we completely stop talking through text or snapchat. I mean, Ill be honest i’m not the type of person to be great at texting. and I think I’m pretty good at understanding that peoples lives can be too busy to text. She told me after our first date to let her know when I would be returning to the campus area to plan another date. Perhaps Im overthinking things, but based on how we text, she may have lost interest? (One word responses, sometimes only responding like a couple of days later). We haven’t talked in like a week pretty much, I will be returning to the area and she will be with her family for only a few more days so she will be around soon too, I just really don’t know how to go about planning a second date since we stopped talking for a bit and our first date was about a month ago, on top of that I have a feeling that she may not be interested anymore.

Like i said im pretty new to dating soo any advice is helpful advice.

tldr: Had a reallly great first date, we wanted to continue but had to pause to visit family outside of the city we live in.

I had to self-taught myself that I should reassurance other other people but not myself. I was scorned at as a young child, and didn't receive any kind words or any reassurance growing up. Instead of being bitter, I just always reassurance everyone else and see them happy.

A big example is I still remember coming home, and my girlfriend a little upset I got a award along with a job promotion. She finded out a month later because a mutual friend told her about it. She wanted to celebrate with me, but was shocked i didn't tell her. She even noted I went to all her events because she knows I love seeing her happy, but is confused why she can't to my events to celebrate my achievements. She wasn't hurted(I think?), just confused about why I never do stuff for myself.

To make it simple while adding stuff, I just never celebrated my achievements.

28,ngcki6,1621447207,Keep standards for dating but don't be so rigid,"I've noticed many people that have a ""list"". It's even been comedic relief in many shows/movies for a person to pull out their foot long list of standards/expectations in a mate and show their friends only to be met with a side eye. And understandably so! 

We can spend all day dreaming of the perfect life that we envision for ourselves but we need to remember this isn't grounded in reality. I've been married 17 years now so I'm no longer dating but I frequent this sub in hopes that my own experiences might help others. And the one thing I've seen in a lot of single people is a rigidity in regards to standards/expectations.

If you narrow down your Google search for a term by being very specific of course it should work and you'll get results! But this isn't Google and narrowing your field is going to make your life exponentially harder plus a lot of times we have no clue what we want, truly!

Before I met my husband I disliked tall, big guys, hated smokers, and hated facial hair. I swore I would NEVER date anyone with these qualities. Guess what? Hubby is 6'1"" 230 lbs, has a face full of hair and smoked when we met.  But I fell in love with him!

Tinder, POF etc want you to list attributes about yourself so that people can compare it to ""the list"" but this is WHY they're so successful. They don't WANT you to find a mate (this would be counterproductive for their revenue). They want you to keep swiping til your hand falls off while their bank account fills up! So they've ruined dating life for you all!

Yes, keep certain specific qualities that are most important. Here's the list I think really should be the ONLY qualities that should be looked at and everything else should be relaxed so that you can discover new things that you might not know you like/dislike (like I had no idea I loved being snuggled up to a hairy giant lol):

Religion (if you're/they're religious and this is important to you/them this has to be a commonality. Many divorces have been caused by spiritual differences)

Sexual preferences: (this one cam still be somewhat flexible but you don't want to be a bisexual dating someone anti-lgbtq)

Criminal history (let me be very clear here- if someone has a prison history, that doesn't rule them out as a great mate! My stepdad was in prison for drug issues years ago but is now a recovered addict, church attending great guy. But if someone is an accused violent offender,  child rapist or murderer that's totally different imho)

Stability- (this isn't just financial stability either. Some great catches start out dirt poor so money shouldn't matter. However.. Does this person move 6 times a decade? Do they job hop? Do they have a string of ""crazy exes"" ?  Do they have mental issues that need to be addressed before getting serious? Do they have legal/financial/school/other troubles that need dealt with? Etc)

Comfort level- (this one is a very personalized thing but something that can't be gauged online. DO THEY MAKE YOU COMFORTABLE? There are some ppl that just give us the willies and make us feel all kinds of uncomfortable and that's something that can't be helped. Trust your gut and don't relax this standard.)

To me everything else (unless I forgot something and in that case feel free to comment!) is flexible. We never truly know what we want til it's presented to us and even them We can turn our nose up thinking We won't enjoy it. We think we know exactly what we want but in actuality none of us have experienced enough in life to know this! There are so many things we don't know about so why play psychic and try to guess instead of experiencing new and different things?

(For disclosure I'm a guy). My whole life I have had tons of male friends and would consider myself to make friends with bros easily. Whenever I'm at a party with my (mostly) male friends, I seem to make new GUY friends incredibly easily, but when I get to know their some of their significant others, and go to parties with their (girl)friends, I tend to be the life of the party with the dudes who know me and somehow (luckily) they never seem to notice, but the women avoid me like the PLAGUE.

Have you ever encountered this with one of your friends, or your S.O friends?

Do you have any interesting/funny stories related?

We had a walk in the forrest with my dog, ate lunch and walked some more around a lake. We talked a lot about random stuff and had some good laughs. No physical contact except for a hug when I dropped her at her house. In total we spend 6 hours together that day. We agreed on doing this again but then bringing her dog as well. 

When I asked if she had time this week, she said she was busy with school. I will see her again at work this Saturday and we will have a little get-together and drinks with some other coworkers after work. But we have no actual date planned for the two of us yet.

We have been exchanging about 20 texts total throughout each day (with a few hours in-between responses). And my heart jumps a little when I receive ANY notification, hoping it is her.

This is my first time actually having a date with a girl and I'm just very inexperienced. Because of this i'm having demons in my thoughts about how I should even do any of this stuff.

 I've read a lot on this subreddit and came to a few conclusions for myself and just want to check if you people agree:

1. Try to break the physical barrier with her in a casual style at work and go on from that when I see her outside of work. (remember I work at a very casual workplace)

2. Try to keep texting at the same level, face-to-face is where one should build the relationship. Don't try to pull big conversations through texting.

3. Complimenting her more when I see her, I worry i'm not giving her the feeling that I find her attractive enough.

4. NOT PUSHING FOR THE 2ND DATE. I've already asked this, but she didn't have time this week. So in my mind the ball is in her court to continue planning the date.

Any of these points are wrong? Any to add? Am I being a bit paranoid or am I just starting to fall in love? Aaaaaargh help me lol. Tnx!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ngehve/is_this_going_well_and_am_i_a_little_paranoid_for/

Most the time we end up kissing or making out on first dates as I'm not shy at all.  Anyways where I hit a wall sometimes is when a potental date always wants text or snapchat but never call or have a meaningful conversation via phone or facetime?

So my question is  where can I meet women that  wanna call me or be old school and not just send texts all day? I understand people are busy but only texting imo is a bad way to get to know someone. Should I go to local parks and read alone? Go to the lake by myself with a bottle of vodka and see who comes up? Bars?  I'm running out of ideas on where to meet genuine  girls.

I'd honestly just prefer a flat no before I get excited that I got the date, started planning, and then it became clear it wasn't happening. Or at least have the date and be then turned down after a bad date.

Just looking to do some introspection here if it's not all that common, because I have to be doing something wrong, something on my social media comes across as a major red flag, or maybe Google someone with my name went to jail for drowning puppies.

Where do I begin with finding things to do to meet people?,"So, I've always been the odd one growing up, with low self-esteem and extremely socially awkward. I have probably gone on dates with 17 women, but only with 3 of them have I ever gotten a second date (some of this was because I turned them down). However, I'm 26 now, and after leaving school, cutting off my abusive parent, going to the gym, and doing a lot of other things, I feel much better. I still have a long way to go, but I'm a pretty stable and confident person now.

Throughout college, I always blamed my lack of success with women on the fact that I had a mediocre financial situation or my poor social skills. But I think these were just excuses, or at least, I was wrongly convinced that women only wanted socially-adept men with STEM or law degrees.

But I've come to accept that the reason for my poor success is my own fault. I simply am not social enough. This is evident because of the fact that in recent years, I have gotten a lot more random compliments from women. During the lockdown, I was completely disaffected by the fact that I couldn't see my friends anymore. I don't actively seek social interaction, except for two very close friends who I might hang out with every 1-2 weeks, on average.

I have thought about going to bars, but is that OK to do by yourself? I've heard about clubs and meetups, but I feel like most of the people who go to those would be 30-40+.

he was extremely possessive, but didn't want anyone else treating me well. i was also very possessive and jealous. he would look at other girls in public, be extremely friendly with his girl friends and even stood up for a girl who was bad mouthing me. i feel like i had a lot of reasons behind being jealous. along with that, i never received reassurance. he told me it was annoying when i constantly asked him to reassure me, but he never did it on his own. one time, i asked him for compliments (stupid right) and he turned to be and said ""you look good"" then walked away. i was extremely open with what i needed from him and he didn't fulfill that at all or even make an attempt to.

i had a lot of self esteem issues by the end of it and felt so hurt by constantly begging for the bare minimum. i finally ended it and he instantly went back to talking to a bunch of girls, getting dating apps and not giving a fuck about me. he even started going on dates with ""the girl i was told not to worry about"". he NEVER took me on a date. despite all of this, i still really wanted his approval. i have a very hard time with accepting he never really cared. there were some really good moments with us. the sex was amazing and we did have some deeper conversations.

he was extremely possessive, but didn't want anyone else treating me well. i was also very possessive and jealous. he would look at other girls in public, be extremely friendly with his girl friends and even stood up for a girl who was bad mouthing me. i feel like i had a lot of reasons behind being jealous. along with that, i never received reassurance. he told me it was annoying when i constantly asked him to reassure me, but he never did it on his own. one time, i asked him for compliments (stupid right) and he turned to be and said ""you look good"" then walked away. i was extremely open with what i needed from him and he didn't fulfill that at all or even make an attempt to.

i had a lot of self esteem issues by the end of it and felt so hurt by constantly begging for the bare minimum. i finally ended it and he instantly went back to talking to a bunch of girls, getting dating apps and not giving a fuck about me. he even started going on dates with ""the girl i was told not to worry about"". he NEVER took me on a date. despite all of this, i still really wanted his approval. i have a very hard time with accepting he never really cared. there were some really good moments with us. the sex was amazing and we did have some deeper conversations.

i guess my question is, how do i move on? i'm very stuck on him, probably because of all the manipulation and begging. i want him to want me back, even though i know he's not good for me. i did so much for him and i'm embarrassed by it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nggv9a/breakup_advice/
60,nggy3z,1621458009,I (24/ female) didn't invite this guy (22/ male) to my parties but now he isn't talking to me.,"I didn't invite this guy to my parties but now he isn't talking to me. 

Hello. 

So there is this guy down my church, a popular church in central london. A year and a half ago, we were friends, but he was rather socially awkward, he told me had self diagnosed autism, I thought he would struggle in party situations so I didn't invite him but others, he found out, he started avoiding me, he was friendly about it though, I apologized, we got on and he confessed he liked me. I rejected him. The following Sunday night he seemed to be avoiding me, I kept waving but eventually I managed to corner him and talk to him, but he was rather awkward, But we got on after, I went away for work for a year and a bit. 

I went back 2 weeks ago, I saw him, he's lost a lot of weight, more sociable, more popular with women and very attractive. Etc. I was happy for him. But everytime I try to talk to him, he's friendly but says he needs to go or he needs to talk to someone else, smiles and leaves. He sees me in the distance at church and uses the back entrance. I don't understand, I was so friendly to him. 

I tried talking to his friend Tyrone about it. I asked if he was playing games or is still into me. He said ""Get over yourself. He falls in love with a different girl every 2 weeks, once he starts avoiding someone, that's it. I think it's because of the party thing. I dunno."". The thing is he actually gets invited to parties now. 

I see him everytime since and his eyes light up when he sees/ talks to this other girl like he did with me and she's taller/ way prettier than me. I dunno what to do about it. I asked his friend if he's seeing anyone. He said ""You and a dozen other women that knocked him back have asked that but yeah I think he's seeing that girl."". 

Is there anything I can do about this? I wasn't mean to him. I was always nice to him.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nggy3z/i_24_female_didnt_invite_this_guy_22_male_to_my/

62,ngh9hg,1621458722,I’m (25M) unhappy and starting to doubt relationship with my gf (25F). Should I discuss this with her?,"
I have been dating my girlfriend (25F) for about a year and have been an official couple for 10 months.

This is my first official girlfriend. I wasn’t the most attractive or self confident growing up. Later in life I got in shape and worked on myself physically, mentally, financially and career-wise. At around 22 yo I was a social guy who got a good job, with his own place and was feeling on top of the world. I’m not trying to boast but friends/family were thinking I had a different girl every week the way I presented myself.

In reality I was a virgin until 24. I had enough attention and dates but there still was a mental block I had to overcome to actually step into a relationship. Last year I matched with my girlfriend on a dating app and said fuck it, I’ll go trough with it this time. She’s a smart, social, caring and attractive (admittedly not typically my type) girl and I just wanted to get it over with. And so I did. We had sex on the second date and went on a weekend trip on the fourth.

It all went really quickly from there. We both fell in love and we made our relationship official after two months. We’ve been on multiple city trips, met each others families and friends, she’s about to start a job in my city and she’s moving in with me this summer. We’re discussing buying a house and having kids in the future, it’s all going really fast.

Now this is all I ever thought I wanted back when I was a virgin but now that I ‘got’ it I’m more unhappy than ever. I don’t even know if I like her enough to spend my entire life with. Meanwhile she’s head over heels for me. I notice people around me never say she’s a catch but all her friends say I’m the catch. Am I the ome ‘settling’ for her? On top of that I’m black and religious and she’s white and atheist. There’s a lot of differences between us and sometimes it feels like a disney movie where ‘love prevails over everything else’ but in reality that rarely works out. It feels like so much responsibility for a girl that isn’t really typically my type either.

I don’t know why I’m unhappy but people around me look at me as some kind of example, so I feel like a fool. I secretly smoke trees on a regular basis to get away from these thoughts but that doesn’t help either. Nothing that made me happy before makes me happy these days.

Do you think I should discuss this with her? I’m sure this will break her heart and I don’t want to lose her. But I really feel lost and combined with the whole pandemic I started to feel anxious while I never suffered from that before. I just want to be happy as I was before.

I matched with this girl on Hinge a while back. After a few messages back and forth, we sat a date. We went out and had drinks and apps and had a great time. Conversation was flowing and she never acted disinterested. After the date, I walked her to her car and kissed her before she left. Over the next few weeks, I asked her once a week to do something, but I got blown off. Meanwhile, she’s still Snapchatting me pretty often. She’ll send me all kinds of sexy photos, in swimsuits, skimpy outfits and even the occasional nudes. She even made sure to tell me today that she got a wax. 

It seems strange that since our date I’m like 0/3 when asking her to hang out or go do something, but she’s still giving off sexual vibes. I don’t feel that there’s genuine interest, but maybe she just wants to fuck. I’m not super into casual sex as I had plenty during college and I’m now in my mid 20’s, but I’ll give it a go if I get the opportunity.

70,ngi1fp,1621460512,I may have gaffed on my third date,"\[28M\],Some context, I'm in a city where we have a 930 pm curfew and my date \[28F\] has an irregular schedule where she is very likely to work on weekends. Somehow we manage to make it work but it has been pretty much been me driving the initiatives for dating.  


For the third date, I took biking and pic-nicking on the river side, had a good time and held her hand multiple times throughout the whole thing and ended with a kiss on the cheek.   


I asked to see her again and suggested we could go to my place next time if she felt comfortable and she answered it was a good idea since she didn't like that we kept being forced to leave in order to make it home before curfew. She even suggested her place was an option. Here's the gaffe:   
Because of her odd schedule, she suggested that she'd let me know which days could work (uh oh!). In the moment I failed to ask her when she would know that and now I'm stewing over whether this is slow rejection or an actual exception to the ""will let you know"" case.  


My standard MO is to just let it slide usually but the circumstances (curfew, schedule, her suggesting her place) have been so out of the ordinary that I'm admittedly overthinking this, as I actually really like her.

71,ngi5p1,1621460805,Trying to date...a friend? idk M (25),"Last year around this time, I got close to a girl who lived with her boyfriend. She and I went to the same high school. We're both 24-25. Throughout the 11-12 months, my friends and I noticed she had an interest in me. We would flirt with each other over text. Her boyfriend was so controlling that he would text me, canceling my plans with the girl. We were at the same party, and he wouldn't let us leave to get food. So she went to the bathroom and sent me a lewd.

Anyway, she broke up with him and moved a couple of weeks ago. We tried making plans, but we both suck. Either I was asleep, or she was out with her co-workers. A couple of days later, I went on a hiking trip out west. She sent me a video over Snapchat asking when I was coming back in a tone of voice that expressed she missed me. Later on the trip, she sent me a picture of herself in a bra. I told her she was a hottie. When I got back, we chilled for the next two days and got food. She loves food. Our outings were 5-6 days ago.

She works about six days a week and isn't overly confident. Being her friend, albeit weird, flirtatious, whatever, etc., this past year makes me feel weird about more blatantly flirting with her. Does anyone have suggestions on how I should approach this? I'm so used to this person being in my life now.

She is too fat
He is too poor
They are living at home
They don't have the right profession



The list in your mind goes on and on.


If you agree on money, kids, and religion the rest will work itself out. If the person you are dating is genuinely good you have already hit the lottery.


Dead broke? Never stop hunting that dream job. It could take years but it will happen if you work hard.


Out of shape? Be honest and be humble. Everyone thinks losing weight is all about numbers. It actually all about their heart. Love them for who they are and no matter how much their body changes, you won't have to worry about attraction.


Living at home? How about you suggest helping them find a place. Have a conversation and see if they are passionate or just lazy. Dream with them and see if your dreams mesh.

So, we have been talking since then and he seemed really sweet and caring about how I've been afterwards. Tonight he messaged me asking if I wanted to come to his tomorrow afternoon as he was going to take a sick day off from work and blame it on a reaction to the Covid vaccine, (he got his vaccine this morning) and we can take things slow and gentle and not have a date as crazy as the one planned on Tuesday. 
I said I would take the day off (which I did) and just let him know how I was looking forward to spending time with him as I needed cheering up. At the same time I said I wouldn't be up for anything physical as I'm in a bit of pain and along with that it's also my time of the month..

He's now backtracked saying 'Oh, early night for me, will need to see how I feel tomorrow, think I've got a reaction to the vaccine coming on, night'. Which really made me feel shit.

I’m very shy and reserved myself, I’m trying to be open so I can see if there’s something there with this guy. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before so I’m not sure if I’m putting a stop to it without trying. My friends are telling me there’s no point because I’m an open book even though I’m shy so it’s a mismatch. They’re telling me we’re not compatible or maybe we’re looking for different things. Do they have a point? Should I just stop before I ruin my own expectations? The fact that I have expectations is not great. He presented himself completely differently to how he may actually be. The change happened quickly. What’s going on?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nglmfs/is_there_any_point/
88,nglog4,1621470145,I am in love with one of my best friends,"So little a year ago me and my friend Ben sat down at a random lunch table with 3 other kids there. These kids names are Carter, Chloe, and Lilly.

The 5 of us started talking and we all realized that we were all mega nerds. We mainly talked about Pokemon.

Anyway so during lunchtime oftentimes Ben, Carter and Lilly would be leaving Chloe and I out a bit. Not intentionally but just talking about stuff we were interested in. Me and Chloe pretty much just showed memes to the other. We really started to bond. I started to develop feelings for her.

Then COVID hit. Just my luck that before hand Chloe was the only person I was not able to get the phone Number of. So a year went by. A few months ago I was talking to Lilly. I mentioned Chloe to her. She said she could give me Chloe's discord. I took her up on that offer in a heartbeat.

So me and Chloe started talking again through discord. It seemed as if she and her family were doing pretty good.

About a month ago Ben invited us all to go see Godzilla vs Kong. Me, Chloe, Ben and Carter all showed up. Lilly couldn't make it. When I walked in Chloe was the only one there. I greeted her with a high five. During the movie we were both going crazy. After the movie was over Chloe hugged me before we left the theater room. I was caught of gaurd but hugged back. When we got outside Chloe's mom agreed to take a photo of the 4 of us. I felt Chloe put her arm around me. I put my arm around her but didn't want anyone to know that I liked her so I put my other arm around Ben.

Before Chloe left she hugged me one more time. I hugged back. She gives the best hugs I have ever felt. No she did not hug anyone else.

The 2 of us have now been talking on the phone practically everyday since the movie. 

I want to ask her out but I am far too afraid to loose my best friend if she rejects me and things then become awkward. I know its only awkward if we make it awkward but we are literally 2 of the most awkward people in school. 

I do plan on asking her out eventually just not for a while.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nglog4/i_am_in_love_with_one_of_my_best_friends/
89,nglunk,1621470646,I need some motivation to ask out this cute girl I’ve been thinking about lately.,"There is a girl who everyday when we walk into class she looks right into my eyes and usually looks away. I’ve caught her in the corner of my eye looking towards me and sometimes she gets up and when she comes back she makes sure I notice her. 

I’m almost positive she’s into me and she’s exactly my type too. I already have everything planned out on how I’m gonna do it I just need a push.

Also some background, a while ago I was dumped by a girl I loved so much and she told me I was pathetic and since then she is dating a guy she met 3 weeks ago who lives thousands of miles away. Yes I know. 

So because of this I’ve realized my worth and it that I have so much love to give, I also realized I tried as hard as I could and if she doesn’t see that then I don’t want her. 

So back to my situation, I need some motivation to do this as I’m probably gonna do it tomorrow and I’m freaking out. I haven’t pulled anything like this in almost 2 years and I’m a bit rusty. Any tips or motivation you can give me? Thanks",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nglunk/i_need_some_motivation_to_ask_out_this_cute_girl/
