1,mgp1ls,1617135625,Don't use sex appeal in your profile's if you don't want men to objectify you!,"Now not all women of course are like this, I'd say 60% of the online dating profile's I'll see have photos where women are wearing very revealing clothing, half naked, or showing off their assets like that's the only thing they WANT guys to value themselves as.

As a guy who does use online dating apps on occasion, you need to unfortunately present to the world the image that you want to come across as. Women who want to project themselves as educated, smart, resourceful don't have pictures of their butt or breasts hanging halfway out of their bra on these apps.

Just like as a guy I'm not going to present myself in any way that isn't what I want to find in a woman.

Basically what I'm trying to get at is, you attract who  you are. Whatever persona you are in real life or online is who you are going to attract. And this goes for both men and women. 

I see women complain about men objectifying them for their body, and granted a lot of men do. BUT what I see is that the women who complain about this THE MOST are women who are literally 1/2 naked on their online profiles (or in person) and then complain about ""all men"" objectifying them.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mgp1ls/dont_use_sex_appeal_in_your_profiles_if_you_dont/

It's happened to me a couple of times, the most recent being a guy on hinge who sent me a message (I didn't match with him) saying something along the lines of ""why are you so cute but so fat?"" 

Like ok? Sorry? I think it's important to show accurate photos of yourself. But I'd be lying if I said these messages haven't completely tanked my confidence. 

For reference I'm 5' 5"" and about 150-155 lbs, so I could stand to lose some weight (and am working on it) but I didn't think it was anything crazy.

21,mgqzbb,1617141183,I (16M) have a crush on my friend‚Äôs younger sister (14F).,"
(Quick formatting disclaimer: any name with quote marks around them is a fake name to maintain anonymity.)

Strap in folks, this is a bit of a long one. So, I‚Äôm a theater kid and two of my closest friends, (both 18) are dating. The boyfriend, my friend ‚ÄúJohn,‚Äù is dating the stage manager, ‚ÄúElena‚Äùand have been since their sophomore year, and they‚Äôre seniors now. I‚Äôm a sophomore. ‚ÄúElena‚Äôs‚Äù younger sister, ‚ÄúKate‚Äù is a freshman and she and I became really fast friends. ‚ÄúKate‚Äù and I were both cast in the same radio play this year. So was ‚ÄúJohn‚Äù and ‚ÄúElena‚Äù was our stage manager. Over the course of the show, I started to develop a crush on ‚ÄúKate.‚Äù She‚Äôs super bubbly, laughs at all my shitty jokes, and is quick to text back. In our texts, she loves complimenting me, especially my hair. The problem is the school situation. 

‚ÄúKate‚Äù and ‚ÄúElena‚Äôs‚Äù parents signed them up for online school this year. I‚Äôve been attending school in person and so I never see them outside of rehearsals for our play. Now that we‚Äôve already recorded our play, I won‚Äôt get to see her around as often as during rehearsals. We do have a premier ceremony for the cast of that radio play that‚Äôs coming up soon, but after that, that‚Äôs pretty much it and I won‚Äôt see her around very much. Everyone in the cast will sign posters or letters for one another. After that though, that‚Äôs the end of the drama department this year because this show the four of us did is the last of the year. I won‚Äôt see ‚ÄúKate‚Äù around as much as I did during rehearsals and I want to get to know her better, maybe get pizza or something. But I don‚Äôt want it to be awkward with ‚ÄúJohn‚Äù and ‚ÄúElena.‚Äù

So, what should I do? I want to ask ‚ÄúKate‚Äù out, but don‚Äôt want to mess with the friendship between myself and ‚ÄúElena‚Äù and ‚ÄúJohn.‚Äù Knowing the two of them, I think it would be fine, but I‚Äôm still worried about making our friendship awkward. Should I ask their permission or something? I know that sounds ridiculous, but I‚Äôm not sure. Like I said, I just don‚Äôt want to damage the friendship between ‚ÄúElena‚Äù and myself by possibly dating her younger sister. Then comes the second half of that, how do I ask ‚ÄúKate‚Äù out, especially since we don‚Äôt see each other at school? I‚Äôve been thinking of asking her out by writing on her poster at the premier, but everyone‚Äôs gonna see that because it‚Äôs passed around to everyone else. I don‚Äôt want to do it over text because I‚Äôm anxious about that type of thing.

36,mgsgfy,1617145636,Men (and women) be honest... am I asking for too much?,"I have been dating (mask friendly, socially distant and outdoors only), and what I have come to realize is that I am either too picky, or I have a skewed perception of what I want in a partner (aka does this person even exist?). All I want is either an equal, or someone that maybe has a bit more figured out than I do (no this does not mean money). 

Please dont roast me, I know this part is going to be lame... self plugging makes me cringe 

Basic info about me

\- 24 y/o female, I have my own place downtown, I have a great job that pays well (meaning I can fully sustain myself and even splurge), I have many friends, well travelled, well educated, hobbies include: hiking, skiing and camping, I have been told I am a positive person, physical attractiveness has never been an issue.

\- personality wise, every guy I have ever seen or dated has always wanted to continue our relationship and have told me I am fun and nice to be around. 

Ok now that aside, here is what I am experiencing:  

 I am meeting all these men (my age and couple years older) and what I am finding is that they are stuck in this frat phase. I am all about a good time, so I dont mind a party or a night out... just not sure I want it happening weekly. Even that aside, most if not all the guys I have met (15 of them), have stated that they have tons of roommates, lots of debt or financial issues, do not have a career path or even an idea of what they could possibly do with their life, no drivers license, they cannot cook, they dont enjoy cleaning. I have had to pay for most stuff date wise (wine at the park) etc.. which I do not mind, except for when it happens more than twice. In addition, the men I have been seeing have made some comments about my lifestyle and personal success, saying that I could be their ""sugar mama"", which is a joke.... but it still got me thinking.

She knows all about my breakup and said that I dealt with it amicably.

Lately there have been some signs that I feel she MAY be interested in me and I'm not 100% certain about it. 

She does give me a cute-sie look and I was thrown off because I've seen that look in other women before. It's the look where her head tilts down and looks her eyes look up on me.

A few weeks ago, we spoke and I told her I was quite disappointed that my ex and I split because I introduced her to my niece. And I don't want my niece to think that it is okay for her uncle to always have different partners. And she goes ""Wow, your moral values are so high. You're going to be an outstanding father""

Then, last week, when we spoke, I was in a super good mood and she couldn't stop smiling. So I asked her why she kept smiling and she responded ""you're in such a good mood it's contagious."" Then a few minutes later she smiled again and I teased her about it and she replied while laughing saying ""I don't know if you're teasing me or not about my smile.""

43,mgthzc,1617148981,If you want IRL dates: Cut the weeks of talking and just ask them out right away!,"To preface: I understand we are in a pandemic, so not everyone wants to meet up for that reason, but for when this is over and for those that are okay with IRL meet-ups right now, listen up!

Are you spending weeks on end talking to your matches, unsure of when you should ask them out? You search everywhere and find that you should ask to meet after X days, and you do, only to get hesitation, rejection, or ghosted.

Here‚Äôs an idea, if you‚Äôve exchanged a couple of messages and you‚Äôre still interested, ask them out on a date! Don‚Äôt ask them to ‚Äúhang out‚Äù or ‚Äúgo for coffee‚Äù or ‚Äúif they‚Äôd like to meet‚Äù or in some other beat around the bush way. 

Ask ‚Äúwould you like to go on a date with me?‚Äù

By being forward, you are showing confidence and being clear with your intentions. If they truly want to go on a date with you, they will say yes. If they like you, as long as you‚Äôre willing to meet in a public place, there is zero reason (pandemic aside) that they would hesitate. Give them a few different days to choose from in case they have plans, and leave it at that.

Anything other than a yes with a confirmed date and time is a no. End of story. Stop wasting your time with people that just want to waste yours, and have no interest in actually meeting you.

Another benefit: by meeting IRL sooner than later, you‚Äôre going to find out sooner than later if they are compatible, and waste less time if they aren‚Äôt.

TL;DR: if they really want to go out with you, they will say yes, and you will waste less time in the process.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mgthzc/if_you_want_irl_dates_cut_the_weeks_of_talking/
44,mgtkb7,1617149188,Irrational jealousy,"I just need someone to tell me I‚Äôm being insecure and stupid really. 

My bf (38) and I (37) have been together a few years. I lost my job when the pandemic started, and not being able to really support myself sent me into a pretty deep depression. I tried  to sell art I had made during my unemployment, but that didn‚Äôt really do much and just made me feel more worthless. My bf was stressed because he was supporting us, and got resentful of me being home all the time and him having to work. Needless to say, our relationship hit a good sized brick wall in the sex department. 

I now have a new job, it pays well, but the hours are long and the commute takes up a lot of the time that he and I used to have available (and both took for granted) together. My job is paper pushing, nothing creative, but it is stable. My previous jobs were usually more suited to my creative side, and I felt more like myself at them. ‚ÄúWho cares about your job, this is the dating reddit‚Äù I know - getting there.

The past few months we‚Äôve made an effort to make more time, be more affectionate, present, and chisel that brick wall from between us in bed. It‚Äôs going well, but sometimes my lack of self... idek what.. just self... gets me.

Now, I know these things are irrational. But I just don‚Äôt feel like enough sometimes. As I mentioned, we are still finding our groove in being regularly intimate, and I should state that I trust my bf completely and know he would never cheat on me. We practically grew up together and I know that‚Äôs just not the kind of person he is.

But today I texted, trying to be spontaneous and sexy, and he at first reciprocated.... then started talking about work and this woman he‚Äôs done a few jobs for. How she has her own business in his same field and that he and her have partnered up for things - she‚Äôs gotten him jobs and the like. 

It just... killed the whole vibe for me. Like I said, I know it‚Äôs my own insecurities and irrational jealousy but... CMON. No one wants to hear their partner start talking up someone else when they‚Äôre trying to be flirty and sexy. 

It doesn‚Äôt help that she is in a creative field, and is successful in what she is passionate about. Idk. I‚Äôm just being a big ass baby. 

Any advice on staving this insecurity and jealousy? I‚Äôm sure this gets asked a lot, but I don‚Äôt really have friends I feel comfortable asking about this. A lot of them are toxic in their relationships and I don‚Äôt trust their judgement  on my irrationality, or advice on how to kinda kill these dumb feelings.

63,mgvuj3,1617156816,"I want an outside opinion on this situation I have (M19, and F19) How do I think about this?","A quick rundown of what the situations background is, I‚Äôm a 19 year old guy and I had a serious relationship with someone for a little over a year. We knew each other for about 4 years and started truly loving each other since early 2020, but before then it was mutually understood that we had feelings for each other but we saw other people in a non-relationship sense, FWB really. We met a few years ago and eventually she moved to another country and that‚Äôs when the feelings for one another truly came to true light, at first it was purely messing around as idiotic teenagers when we were around each other a few years ago, then it transitioned into a constant contact long distance and by 2020, we held a healthy relationship that was true and honest and transparent. It was not until late November that things came to an end when she was stressed with work and getting into school, which I completely understood. I asked if she was okay, we couldn‚Äôt understand why she felt bad, not at me but about her feelings being jumbled and confusing. I asked her to consider the possibility that she may have fallen out of love, and she confirmed after about three days. We remained best friends as I was there for her during her time with an abusive step father and a semi-negligent mother. I was hurt, but not by her, just the concept of it coming to a close. I still held a strong love for her because she was really my first true love of any kind that wasn‚Äôt somewhat fabricated. 

Shortly after this, less than a week before December, she comes and tells me she‚Äôs conflicted, she thinks that this isn‚Äôt a true end to things between us, and that it was perhaps distance that driven us apart. But considering how it was a strong relationship for so long being long distance, i said it‚Äôs possible, but it‚Äôs also possible that it was a genuine loss of feelings. so a long conversation ensued where it was known that we are both open to the prospect of a rekindled relationship, but that it should be natural and unforced. And that we should wait until we see each other face to face again on one of our many planned trips to Europe and Asia. If it rekindles, it rekindles, if it doesn‚Äôt, it doesn‚Äôt. Aswell as being open to new relationships should they arise. She confides in me that she doesn‚Äôt think she‚Äôll ever really get to the point in another relationship that we had. Not to that same true level, I tell her that it‚Äôs not in anyone‚Äôs control, it‚Äôs a natural occurrence and shouldn‚Äôt be messed with, it should all happen on its own. Throughout all this time, we have been extremely close still, but on the platonic level on expressions. We still say to each other that we miss each other, we spoiled each other with Christmas gifts, and still call at least once or twice a week. 

Recently she has told me that she‚Äôs met someone, mind the fact that we never really stopped talking since the breakup. I was happy for her, and surprisingly not sad or hurt by it, I just wanted her to be happy and experience new things. I was her first relationship, she wasn‚Äôt my first relationship. But she tells me that she held off for about a week or two from telling me due to the fact of horror stories she‚Äôs heard of other people being stricken by sadness over hearing this type of news, but that she knew I wasn‚Äôt immature like that but still had to flip back and forth between whether or not it was appropriate to bring it up. She did, and I‚Äôm happy she did, I asked for her to describe the situation and it became a pretty good conversation on her having grown from the relationship we had, being more comfortable with relationships than she had before we were together. 

She says that he knows I exist and that we‚Äôre best friends, and that he isn‚Äôt opposed to that, but he doesn‚Äôt know the history between us that spans years. She didn‚Äôt know whether or not she should tell him, tell her that she should tell him if he asks or when it‚Äôs appropriate when it hits the point of love between them two, but she says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think me and him will get to that point, he just gives off that vibe‚Äù. She also mentions that she doesn‚Äôt see this as becoming a substantially long relationship between them. I ask if it is a FWB type of deal, and she says it isn‚Äôt, she sees it that if he were only in it for the sexual bit, that he would have already tried to do so. And that He‚Äôs a nice guy, he seems really chill and has a lot of interests with her, so I told her to not place it out of the realm of possibility. but I can‚Äôt help but wonder why it seems that she may be more open with me than to him or what it all means. I offered to give her a lot of space to pursue that new relationship, but she was opposed to me distancing myself. 

I still hold my feelings for her, I‚Äôm not entirely sure on where she lays on feelings, we still plan to travel together to Europe and Asia, and we still talk everyday.




Now for my questions, 

Does this rekindle at some point in time considering the fact that she doesn‚Äôt seem to take her new relationship to the point of seeing it build into love?

Where do her feelings lay?

What does this mean?

I ended up going to hang with his friends afterwards and he had this buddy who I never met before and we chatted. Long story short I ended up staying the night because I had been drinking a bit nothing happened except some cuddles but he seemed like a really wonderful person and he really liked my brother and that made me d super happy. Well I texted him afterwards and said thank you for letting me stay etc. etc. because at the end of the day I know he was being kind. 

He hit me with a ‚Äòit was nice to meet you, take care. ‚Äò


Part of me is still thinking about him but since he said take care I felt like it would be weird to ask him if he wanted to ever meet up. He was single for sure and I felt extremely comfortable with him and maybe that‚Äôs just because I needed some tlc but I don‚Äôt know.  I in no way felt badly for staying either. 


Anyway my question really is if someone says take care‚Äô should I assume that means ‚Äútake care I won‚Äôt see you again‚Äù 

Obviously this probably seems really ridiculous. But my brain won‚Äôt stop replaying it/him 

Should I let be what it was? 

Should I text and ask him if he ever wants to meet up? If so how? 

I‚Äôll be honest even before this I‚Äôve recently been shooting my shot more but I never really follow through.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mgvvar/trying_to_decipher_the_take_care/

I‚Äôm unconvinced but am convinced it‚Äôs a synthetic card, a scapegoat, and, well, an unfortunate outlet for not achieving an expected outcome.

Being Asian makes you unique. Combine that with confidence and personality and you‚Äôre far more advantaged because you are different. 
This has been my experience.

I am very Asian and successfully dated every personality in which I was attracted. If you‚Äôre only interested in sex then go out to a bar any day of the week. Being Asian is not your barrier.

My only barrier has been not wanting to settle down because I‚Äôve been there and done that; ie a 17 year committed relationship with a former model.

My point being, if you are Asian, you‚Äôre likely sabotaging the attraction via your insecurities as a minority.

76,mgwvq5,1617160371,"Dating in my age, race, and generation kind of sucks right now.","I‚Äôm 18f and black and I think I am royally screwed when it comes to dating. For starters- the elephant in the room if you will, me being black. I‚Äôve grown up in a predominantly white town all my life and it has seriously fucked with the way I view dating, and myself. It took me forever to realize that guys probably don‚Äôt like me because of my race, not because I‚Äôm unattractive. It‚Äôs painful growing up in a situation where no one really likes you, sometimes not even your own race. Also, I feel like if someone does like me, it‚Äôs fake. I think I‚Äôm so used to not being chosen, that when I am chosen I second guess and I‚Äôm like ‚Äòare you sure you like me?‚Äô. I think that‚Äôs my own problem though maybe. On top of that, there‚Äôs guys that fetishize black women so I have to be mindful of that. 
I‚Äôm also starting college next fall and the college I‚Äôm going to is a PWI. Thinking about it now, I feel like I should of chosen an HBCU, but it was really far from home and I really didn‚Äôt want to be too far yet, at least not till grad school. But the college I‚Äôm going to has great education, and has a great program for my career path. I always tell myself when I am feeling down, ‚Äújust wait till college things will get better‚Äù, but.... will it actually? It might just be the same as high school where I feel like an outlier in the dating pool, and no ones choice.

I also dislike the way my generation views dating, with hookup culture and all that jazz. Everything moves super fast and it seems like sex happens before a first date. I hate this because I am super inexperienced with dating and sex, and I feel like I‚Äôm not gonna find anyone who‚Äôd want to take it slow. I haven‚Äôt had my first kiss, held hands with a guy, and I‚Äôve only hugged a guy once, let alone have sex. And I want my first time to be special but that seems impossible with the amount of people who just want a quick fuck. Plus at my age, starting my freshman year of college, of course no ones going to want to take anything slow. The way I‚Äôd like it is, I‚Äôd want to be in a relationship with someone I love and trust, and who loves me before losing my virginity. But I‚Äôm scared that as soon as guys find out I‚Äôm a virgin they won‚Äôt want to take that time and they‚Äôll dip. 
And the cherry on top of the sundae, we‚Äôre in a pandemic, and who knows when that‚Äôs gonna be over. This makes everything so much harder because not only are there extra precautions to dating, but people have gotten lazier. This pandemic has caused people to date out of boredom and it never gets anywhere, and I don‚Äôt want to waste my time with those types of things. 
I just want to experience a relationship, and dating and sex in a meaningful way but I feel like I won‚Äôt be able to. I try not to let the hopeless romantic in me cloud the reality of things, and I feel like what I want isn‚Äôt too unrealistic, just hard to find I guess.

80,mgxejt,1617162312,I need some advice about a situation,"I apologize for the length of this, I'll try to keep it short. It's just a lot to explain. 

I've been seeing this guy off and on for about five years now. We're best friends, crack each other up, talk multiple times a day... I can't imagine life without him. But it's been a long road getting to this point. 

Here's where it's getting messy. He lives with his ex, with whom he raises a child (hers, not his, but he's been there since the kid was a baby) that's now 12. For several years he would do the hot and cold thing, refused to ever say we were dating, want me when I was dating someone or stopped being interested in him, then tell me he ""just wasn't a relationship person"", come over and sleep with me in the mornings when he could get away with saying he was ""at the gym"" but never hang out with me otherwise. And a lot of this had to do with the fact that this ex he lives with (still lives with) would completely lose her shit each time she ever found out we were hanging out. She'd go through his phone and make demands and at one point she got so mad that she moved out for a few months, but of course moved right back in after that time, as she refuses to support herself. And he was so upset she left. So, anyway, she absolutely hates my guts (to this day) even though all I ever did to her was begin a relationship with her ex.... after they had been broken up for the better part of a year. 

Fast forward a few years and he now decides he does love me and wants to be together. However, he refuses to change his living situation. I have expressed that I need this to change if we are actually going to be a couple. But he's making zero effort to change it. I don't feel that he even wants to change it. I feel like he can't see how toxic this person is. And let me add also that I'm not a jealous person, I fully believe that they are not and have never been sleeping together since the day I met him, and if she had ever been even slightly reasonable I wouldnt even be having an issue with their cohabiting in order to raise a child. But she wasn't reasonable, has never been reasonable, texts him constantly when he's around me, and generally is awful. So that changes my outlook. 

I just don't know what to do now. Now that he says he wants this and is making an effort in so many ways. He buys me gifts, makes big efforts to see me and spend time and be sweet, helps me with home tasks, writes me handwritten letters all the time, and is very apologetic for his past behavior toward me because of her.

I don't have kids so I don't know the anguish one would feel living in a home away from their child. I guess my question is, am I being unreasonable in asking him to make a living situation separation? It's been nearly five years of this. And I don't see him changing it.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mgxejt/i_need_some_advice_about_a_situation/
81,mgxfuo,1617162450,What kind of mental health issues she had ?,"I previously posted this question but got no replies. Just want to know what kind of person was she ? what type of mental health issues she was having ?

2 years ago , I met this girl who is sister of my friend. She confessed her undying love for me just after few months of the death of her ex-husband(who died of blood cancer and the marriage lasted 2 years). Though I liked the way she presented herself but still I was reluctant to talk to her because I thought it was too early to talk to somebody who's husband just died. She texted me , I replied and then it all started. She expressed her feelings , and told me that she used to like me a lot but got married due to family pressure and now she's madly in love with me. It all started from that point. She was full of life. but whenever I call her she was always like ""talk to me on video , open your cam and I want your attention"" , ""see my closet, look how organised my things are"", ""I always buy branded things"" ""I like expensive perfumes"", ""hey come on I know you don't say that but you love me too and as a lover you need to show your love and affection for me in front of everyone and must own me.""

I became so occupied with her demands that I couldn't decide what to do. but one thing that was keeping me in a relationship was her honesty. She was damn honest to me. I am not wrong but she has always spoken truth. Like telling me about her family, friends even the minor details of her life. She even reveals details about her family that I wasn't even interested in, like her mother's fight with her father, her family income, her father health issues. She trusted me, asked my opinions in various situations and thanked me for my support. She's given me lots of expensive gifts though her income was not too much.

I don't know why and when that happened but I fell in love with her. She asked me that if i really love her I need to confess my love for her in front everyone and propose her quickly. Just after an year when I really made up my mind to propose her. She was like ""better do it quickly , because you are making me wait"" ""If you really love me why not show your love for me in front of the world"". she said that now her mother taunts her too much that she's not getting married soon and constantly pressurize her to get married and start a family. she started talking to other rich and well settled guys who showed little interest in her and she thought that they might propose her and when I confronted her about that she apologized and said it's just because of the pressure she is facing from her mother.

After 1 and half year, she told me she just wanted to get married and needed a partner and now that I am making her wait she was like ""you don't care about my feelings"" ""you're a selfish person"" , ""you have no idea what i'm going through"" ""I'm facing pressure from my family"" ""people of my age group are getting married and I am not"" ""you are not listening to me anymore""

She started giving me ultimatums and left me with no choice but to marry her. Anyways, I was like ""okay, if you are happy with that lets get married"". just after that she became happy and decided a date for engagement and planned everything herself. She told me that she's bought clothes and other things. She was fully prepared. I don't know why but back in my mind many things were going on (I needed a break as I wanted to assure myself that everything i'm doing is not under any pressure) I wasn't very comfortable with everything. I asked her that i'm not very comfortable and if she can give me some more time. listening to this, she started hurling abuse at me, called me names  said a lot of bad things about me and my family, she said that she's decided everything now and now i'm taking more time. she said I have zero decision power and now i must get out of her life. I couldn't believe what she was saying I immediately blocked her and went no contact with her. She texted me from another number that she's very sorry for what she did, she was upset and now I need to accept her apology and get ready for engagement preparations. I blocked that number too.

It's been 6 months of no contact. I have heard that she's marrying another guy with a lot of money. I still miss her but don't want her back.

We usually see each other once a week sometimes more and will go out to dinner, a movie or some other activity on a weekend night and then sleepover at one of our places.

We don't have sex every time we have slept over and a couple times have just snuggled and talked in bed which felt super intimate. Last week I introduced him to my friends and this week I met his which (not sure how guy's view the friends meeting a girl) but felt like a big step for him to include me in his group and it went great. We aren't constantly texting but do text some everyday asking about each other's days, not overly sexual so not getting just a hookup vibe.

I hide my hands from people because of that. Honestly, I'm ashamed of them. I've tried countless meds and multiple therapist to help with my depression, ocd, and social anxiety; but nothing has seemed to work.

I don't even like having full body pictures taken without my hands being hidden.

I'm already at a heavy disadvantage since socializing has always been difficult for me. That, and I don't disclose much about myself given there's not many happy highlights of my life to bring up.

I just worry about what the impression would be given how awful my fingers can look and the inherent idea that biting ones fingers or nails means they're immature, childish, or strange.

It's been roughly 2 years since my last relationship, and honestly I've been a bit fearful to start again because my dermatophagia was the subject of far too many arguments. I don't want that to happen again since all it caused was resentment and a feeling of isolation.

But it's been a while, and I feel like I want to try dating again since I'm in a different city and I've spent a lot of time trying to improve myself and figure myself out.

So, yeah... strange question I guess. What advice do you have for a person who's fingers look like they were shredded?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mgydh5/im_kinda_afraid_to_date_again_because_of_my/

92,mgyjc7,1617166624,PTSD from being catfished,"I am 40m, I live in a town virtually devoid of singles. I had been single for at least 2 years before meeting my catfish this last November. Things were amazing at first, she would send me all kinds of racy photos which I later came to find out we‚Äôre not here at all, but rather photos taken from the Twitter of an adult content creator from Florida. I didn‚Äôt see all the red flags early in because I was blinded by love from seeing what was going on. She would be there everyday, but her behavior was abnormal. If I would ask for a short video or her or to FaceTime or cam to cam, she would get secretly agitated and threaten to break up with me, even when I asked her to just make me a short video of herself telling me she loved me. It took a while for me to figure out what was going on, but eventually I did. I contacted the adult content creator from Florida to make them aware that their photos were being used in attempts to get gift cards for nudes. She did this with god only knows how many men, but then I looked up what Nigerian romance scammers do to their victims and every that that she did fit right into their scam script. I even opened a Netflix and gave her access, only to see that instead of the location she claimed to be in, the login was from....you guessed it, Nigeria. I flipped the hell out on the scammer and despite my best efforts to report them to the FBI, nothing has happened. People like her are really the worst, they hurt so many people. The whole experience has left me with a case of PTSD and severe depression. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever be able to believe a woman if she tells me she loves me, or if I‚Äôll ever be in a right frame of mind to try again. I‚Äôm going to start getting counseling to help with my depression which had become a constant. I‚Äôve had a nervous breakdown before because of a previous GF lie to me and cheat on me with another man online for 4 months before finding out. Are there really honest woman left? I‚Äôm sharing my story as a lesson that if a woman with supermodel looks approaches you and tries to start a relationship wherein the are always asking for gift cards , don‚Äôt even say anything, just block them. I hope this can help other men from sharing in my fate.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mgyjc7/ptsd_from_being_catfished/
93,mgykev,1617166754,Not texting her before first date? Power move or extremely stupid? Ladies advice wanted!,"Got girls numbers. The period till the first date is 11 days ATLEAST. Two concerns

1) I text her two often between that period and exhaust conversation and or say something to screw it up

2)I dont text enough and the fire burns out and I screw it up

Options

1) the ultimate power move- pretend to forget about her risking her forgetting about me

2)text her sparingly but need advice on how sparingly? Every few days? I dont want to be texting her like im her bf or anything or too often where she thinks I'm clingy and bails

Please note that im a 28 year old male and shes a 20 year old female. Ladies try to think about what u were like at that age. As for judgement, yes I know im going straight to hell so please stick to the advice part.

Any advice would be helpful",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mgykev/not_texting_her_before_first_date_power_move_or/

97,mgyozh,1617167234,Why is this girl being so fishy and weird?,"I work with a girl who is attractive. So in the beginning we were pretty flirty, had banters, conversations and so on. Later I found through someone else at work she has a BF and shes going on vacation with him. So when I talked to her about the vacation she just said ""I am going on vacation with friends"".  Some time later we were having another conversation and I asked for her insta and she gave it to me so I requested her. Weeks later she didnt accept my request and claimed her account is private although she has 1,300 followers lol (probably mostly bots or ppl she doesn't talk to).  A few weeks after that, she offered me to follow her ""cat account"" and I told her NO.  I found her behavior strange so I started avoiding and interacting with her less and keeping it work professional. 

Months later we had a big party at work and she brought him and I met him.  Since then I've been avoiding her and not talking to her as much. She seems to be approaching me a lot more often now and striking up conversations.  

Recently, a few days ago, she sends me a request to follow me on insta.....

98,mgyumt,1617167855,(20M) She was not interested last year but is now getting closer,"I posted this on a different sub, and I wanted to get more thoughts on this

 

So late last year, I stupidly DM'ed this girl who I barely knew and asked her for a coffee date. She said she wasn't interested but would like to go as friends, and my conviction (until now) was that it was that.

Fast forward some time, and we began to talk to each other again, this time just having a fun conversation about a game she told me she liked. She told me she wanted to try it and I offered to go over to her place and play. We ended up playing it up to around 1:30 AM and we had a great time. She giggled at almost any attempt of a joke I made, offered me some of her popcorn and she seemed to be very comfortable.

That was about 2 weeks ago. Now we've planned to go over her place again to show her the wonders of indie films. We're gonna watch a French film over wine and scented candles at night. This is something I never do even with friends.

Now, there's a 99.93% chance that she's still not interested, but I've even noticed that over time, she become much, much more communicative. I feel like that I asked her out way too soon, and maybe now she's seen the kind of guy I am but having her said she wasn't interested before, I'm not banking on it working out.

Do people change their mind when they first said they weren't interested? I don't know, but I am curious. I won't sleep over it anyway.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mgyumt/20m_she_was_not_interested_last_year_but_is_now/
