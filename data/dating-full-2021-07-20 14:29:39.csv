We had chemistry, physically and emotionally. It was the first time in years where I honestly felt there was a good healthy start to something.

It was our last date where right before he texted me and told me he wanted to end it early (I was originally supposed to stay over) and while the date in itself was fine that night, on my way home I cried because I felt him push himself away from me that last week/date.

When I asked what was wrong, we ended up meeting up and he said that this happens to him where he just loses feeling almost instantly. I felt honestly crushed that day. I didn’t know what to say, he offered friendship but it felt like it was out of pity and I said no.

I decided to write him a letter a few days later which essentially was just a description of how I had come to care for him and that I still felt a connection. That I hoped he cared for himself and that maybe we could try again. He never responded but followed me on social media and continued to like thing/respond to my stories which made me feel really weird. I messaged him a few weeks later to say I need to cut off all contact and that I wished him the best. His response was that he felt not replying to my letter was the best reply and that really sucked.

I felt really hurt by his actions and I couldn’t understand what went wrong. I’ve come to the conclusion that even though he said he wanted a relationship, he seems scared of them. I think the worst part is I can’t seem to stop thinking about him and I don’t know why. I think about it constantly and can’t help but feel pathetic in this whole situation. Especially because I can’t help but wonder if he really only was seeing me to sleep with me.

Here is my story and it has opened my eyes to the importance of appareance.

This girl I was madly in love with, we have worked in the same place together and I have developed a strong connection with her.

I told her about my feelings and she said she is not ready for any relationship... 

I went to study abroad, and when I came back to my home country after 6 months to see my family ( I was still a student) I told her if she wanted to meet with me to hangout..and share a good time together... 

She said yes, and we meet.

SHE WAS SO COLD / RUDE / ARROGANT with me.

1st - She didn't wanna take anything when we sat down in a coffee shop, not even a cup coffee. 

2d - From her behaviour, I felt that she was looking down at me

3d - After 20 minutes, she wanted to go, yet I was so respectful / gentle with her. 

4th - She was walking very distant from me

5th - Didn't want me to accompany her to her place ( we are living in a ""3rd word"" country, there are many theifs, bad people especially at night / that's why I wanted to walk with her a little bit so that she can reach her home safely and she knows that)... 

Anyway, I was very MAD, I said to my self SHE IS NOT WORTH IT. 

I felt miserable, I didn't know what's wrong.. 

I'm a very educated individual, very smart and as far as I know I'm a decent looking dude... 

Anyway, after few hours of our meeting, she sent me a text saying that she was happy meeting me with some hearts and kisses.... 

I REALLY DISLIKED her after what she did, and I become very cold with her because frankly I lost ALL feelings I had for her after that meeting... 

After 1 year and a half, THINGS CHANGED. 

I was working out 5 times a week, eating healthy and got in a very good shape (I'm 1m78) 

When I say a very good shape, I MEAN a VERY GOOD Shape. 

It was clear to everyone that I have a nice body and that I was taking care of my self. 

I was looking strong and lean. 

Anyway, I've meet that same girl and her behaviour changed DRASTICALLY in compare to her behavior when I met her last year... 

1 - she was laughing at everything I say
2 - we sat down for about 1.5 hours (20 min last year) 
3 - she asked me to have a walk together, and she was walking very close to me (touching my skin etc...) and at one moment she hold my hands like a freaking couple and she was VERY HAPPY. 

And said after our meeting that she missed me SO MUCH and wanted to meet again before returning... 

Anyway, I will never forget how she treated me the 1st time we met.

Do you think that kind of girl can make a good wife? Because I don't believe so. Anyway, We are both 26 years old.

I am a very independent person (26F) who likes my space, but often I find it difficult to find compatible men. My busy job, interest in pursuing my own hobbies, and chronic illness (fibromyalgia) add to my need for recovery time between social activities.

I am self-aware enough to realize that I have a somewhat avoidant attachment style- I’m perfectly fine with only seeing a person I’m dating once a week, find very serious romantic overtures kind of cringy, and often feel very “take it or leave it” about relationships in their early stages. I get lots of interest, but men have a tendency to become very clingy, very fast for some reason. Wanting to text all the time and see me 3+ times a week after only a couple dates. I often feel that many men I have dated don’t have their own social lives outside of the girls they date! Relationships with family and friends and my one longer past relationship (ended because of a move) are/have been perfectly functional with this need for space, but although I can get a date, I often end things early on because I can’t cope with giving someone so much of my energy and attention, and begin to to feel suffocated.

Can any introverts or slightly avoidant people give me hope? Anyone have a relationship where you give each other your own space for hobbies and rest but come together to do fun things?

I'm honestly just thinking about not taking to her or looking her way when in the same area just because I don't want to make her uncomfortable and would like to see if she would actually start a conversation with me?

I am pretty new to this whole “dating” thing and needed some advice for this girl that I have been seeing for about a month now. 

It all started on Bumble, I saw her profile and she had a picture with Steve Carrel and thought to myself “Wow i’m a huge fan of the office, this could be a great talking point”. So long story short, we start messaging and I happen to mention to her how my favorite episode is when Michael gets gum stuck in his hair and Dwight uses peanut butter and covers his hair to get out the gum. She laughed and said “that is one of my favorite episodes as well”. Then we go on our first date to a bar, and I thought it would be a funny joke to bring a jar of peanut butter and say I got gum stuck in my hair and she laughed and we continued on with a normal conversation. I walked her home, gave her my jar of peanut butter and went on my way. 

A week or so passes and she texts me asking to go out for a 2nd date, we go grab dinner at this nice Italian place and she brings the peanut butter. She gives it back to me and laughs “I only came to give you back your Jif Extra Chunky PB”. I felt uncomfortable as to if she only wanted to see me again because of the peanut butter. But, I put it behind me and went on with the night. 

This is where things start to get weird, I asked her if she wants to come to my parents beach house for the weekend and she said she will only come if I bring the peanut butter. I thought it was a joke and responded “yes of course lol”. Then when she arrives at my parents house she asked me where it was and I responded “I thought it was a joke” and then she storms out and tells me that she never wants to see me again. 

This has left me very distraught, was she only dating me for the extra chunky PB I had? Or is she just playing an even bigger joke on me that I am just not understanding.

Then I asked her out for coffee last Tuesday and then she cancelled last minute saying she had to get some work done and would be available after the weekend. Then I start texting her again that Saturday. Surprisingly completely unplanned I go out to a bar that night, and I bump into her. Things were going really well, she mentioned how she thought it was so sweet how I asked her for coffee since she felt like every guy was after a hookup on tinder. Then we hit it off really well, and we ended up staying at my place. That night I didn’t try to make a move on her since she was really drunk. But then the next morning we started making out and one thing led to another, and as we were about to have sex I just went completely soft and couldn’t get it back up. I explained to her that I was a virgin so I guess I had anxiety with going through with it.  Then shortly after her friend came to pick her up but we talked about meeting for coffee in a couple days like we planned originally.

Then I texted her a few hours later saying I had a good time and that she also forgot her earrings at my place and then she found it funny and then I told her that I can give it to her on our date, to which I never got a response. Then the next day (today) I decided to text again asking if we’re still on for today and still no response.

I’m curious is the reason she’s ghosting me is because she thinks I’m another one of those guys that is after one thing, and even though it seemed like I did try to hook up with her, I actually wanted to date her from the start it’s just that things got a little too intimate too fast.

I’m just wondering if I should just forget about it as it is, or should I wait a couple of days and say something like “I’m sorry if I moved things too fast or if I made you uncomfortable”, but at this point I’m guessing she doesn’t care about getting her earrings back either.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,909132,public,self,Is it too late and I screwed things up?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/oo5z4a/is_it_too_late_and_i_screwed_things_up/,all_ads,6,,,,

- no4: they left you for someone else, you’ll probably see the proof of this soon enough if it’s true and I pity the guy/girl dating the person you were if they just turned their back on you like that, they’ll do this to anyone and they reek of insecurities

- no5: you know did everything you could but this person still left without at least telling you anything, they have the right to like anyone they choose but you have a right to know wtf happened, don’t stress it because in this case the trash took itself out

We had an intense connection and everything felt so natural between us, as if we had known each other our whole lives. 

He asked me on an initial dinner date after talking for a week, then cancelled that afternoon saying he was going to a family event that will run over. That should have been a red flag but I told him it was okay things happen. That evening, I told him since he cancelled on our date why don't we just go for a walk later on once he was done with his family even and we did. 

As soon as we met in person it was like sparks. We spent a lot of time with each other and he said he liked me and wanted to get to know me better. After 2 weeks of hanging out, we were watching a movie at his home and since it was so late I slept over. 

We were making out and he was feeling me up and so I suggested escalating it, and he responded that we should just cuddle because he wanted to wait. Which I respected and found to be very kind. He drove me home that night and then ghosted me. 

During our last night in bed, I told him I felt him putting away and asked why. He said that we were spending so much time together and he did not expect that. He also felt we were moving too fast. 

I told him we could slow down and go at a pace which he felt comfortable. 

After not hearing from him when I sent him the thank you the day text. I gave him space, then 2 weeks past and I still had not heard from him, so I texted him asking if he was ok. No response… then a few days pasted and I got upset and I called him 3x times and texted him telling him that it was fucked up. How could you be cuddling with someone and spending time with them, telling them how much you like them. Then disappear as if it never happened. He finally responded saying that he was not interested and to leave him alone and then he blocked me. 

I’m upset at myself for letting someone I just met affect me so much. I expected to not have these issues with an older man and to not have been lead on.

We went out twice and met on Bumble.  Without a better way to word this, she was extremely good looking and pretty young.  I think I was solely attracted to her looks.  I think her profile said she was 29.  Even though she's a "" misses big shot'' lawyer, I think she was not making too much money.  She had roommates, drove a beater, and had student loans out the butt.

Each time we hung out she would solely talk about work.  I mean in details about criminal cases.  She is a public defender.  Both of my parents work in the legal field, so I was able to keep up with the conversation at least somewhat.

I remember secretly thinking ""Well if she wants to talk about filing some motion trying to get guys sentence reduced, I guess we'll talk about that.""

""If she wants to talk about some weird case she read in law school, I guess we'll talk about that.""

""If she wants to talk about how the real money is outside of criminal law, I guess we'll talk about that.""

""If she wants to talk about staying in court till 9 pm last Friday since the judge moves like cold syrup, I guess we can talk about that.""

Now I'm aware I'm probably not the best conversation partner.  I would try to change the subject to something more light hearted / cutesy, but then the convo would inevitably go back to her time in law school / court.

So here's my question.  What would have meshed with that?  Like... what could I have done differently?

I hope I worded that right.  To use an analogy it's like you go over your buddies house, and all he wants to do is watch Star Trek the whole day.  You agree, but then he boots you out saying ""dude you're boring.""  I'm just thinking I'M JUST DOING WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO!

The reason I do this is because I don't know her schedule and I don't want to pick a day that she won't be free.

Finding that middle ground of agreeing on a time and place without starting vague, one-lining it, or fucking it up some other way is just hard for me.

We had an intense connection and everything felt so natural between us as if we had known each other our whole lives.

He asked me on an initial dinner date after talking for a week, then canceled that afternoon saying he was going to a family event that will run over. That should have been a red flag but I told him it was okay things happen. That evening, I told him since he canceled our date why don't we just go for a walk later on once he was done with his family event and we did.

As soon as we met in person it was like sparks. We spent a lot of time with each other and he said he liked me and wanted to get to know me better. After 2 weeks of hanging out, we were watching a movie at his home and since it was so late I slept over.

We were making out and he was feeling me up and so I suggested escalating it, and he responded that we should just cuddle because he wanted to wait. Which I respected and found to be very kind. He drove me home that night and then ghosted me.

During our last night in bed, I told him I felt him putting away and asked why. He said that we were spending so much time together and he did not expect that. He also felt we were moving too fast.

I told him we could slow down and go at a pace that he felt comfortable.

After not hearing from him when I sent him the thank you the date text. I gave him space, then 2 weeks past and I still had not heard from him, so I texted him asking if he was ok. No response… then a few days passed and I got upset and I called him 3x times and texted him telling him that it was fucked up. How could you be cuddling with someone and spending time with them, telling them how much you like them. Then disappear as if it never happened. He finally responded saying that he was not interested, to leave him alone, and that I needed help for messaging him so much and then he blocked me.

I’m upset at myself for letting someone I just met affect me so much. I liked that he was older because I thought he would not do that. He lead me on and then disappeared.

When we met, he told me that he wanted to get married soon and build a family in the next 2-3 years. That his intention was for building something with someone.

Something my friend told me was that perhaps he was just lonely and wanted affection but was not ready for something real.

Hello all, 


So my girlfriend and I have been dating for a solid almost 8 months now and to say we’re madly in love with one another is an understatement. My intentions are to eventually marry her and in the next year or so if everything goes to plan and start a new life together filled with love and happiness! I can’t imagine not ever being madly in love with her! 

Currently after almost 8 months the two of us are what most would refer to as the puppy love/ cute love/honeymoon stage etc… 

To say that the two of us are all over each other and absolutely crazy for the other would be a definite understatement and I think we’re building a solid foundation for what truly lies ahead! 

In my opinion, we’ve already gotten ridiculously comfortable each other, our communication level is really strong in my opinion, we love each other for who we truly are, and we overcome obstacles pretty easy as of now. 

All of this being said, much to my disappointment and fear, I realize this phase isn’t destined to last forever and alas there will be a day where the two of us aren’t simply all over each other and crazy as we once were. To be completely honest, I get anxious thinking about it as I don’t truly know what to expect. Additionally how do we as a unit navigate these waters so we don’t jeopardize what the two of us have been building for? I’ve never experienced even this far into a relationship let alone the phase where the two of you grow apart. 

Is there anything we could be doing now in the lovey phase that can help us in the next phase of our relationships? Any tips, recommendations, ideas? Also what can I expect to encounter possibly along the way? 

Also any stories you’ve experienced along the way would be greatly appreciated.

I’m from Switzerland so I’d like to apologize for potential mistakes.

I‘ve never dated anyone and I don‘t think I‘ve flirted with anyone either. I‘m mostly pretty lonely and have left school because of my bad mental health. I‘ve been staying at home since last February and I‘ll be starting a new school in August. During this time I only talked to a few people; my parents, my psychologist and rarely some other family members and I‘ve been feeling really lonely lately. It‘s also the first time ever that I wanted a romantic relationship. I feel as though I want someone who I can share my emotions with, I can hug, love and trust and who shares these feelings and who shares their emotions with me as well and who loves me and all of that. I hope you understand what I‘m trying to say. I just want someone to want me. Anyways, these feelings are pretty new to me and I actually appreciate them because the emotional numbness seems to fade at least a little bit. I‘ve also been taking a SSRI for 5 days now but that has yet to take effect which is normal. I hope it can at least help me to get more positive emotions and more mental drive and motivation.

While this has a positive side it also has a negative one. Now I have a feeling that no one will ever want me. I‘m quite short (1.70m) and pretty skinny (I only weigh around 55kg). I also have a really bad posture. My mom tells me sometimes that I walk like the hunchback of notre dame. Often I feel like an alien around people and I feel as though I have nothing in common with them. I have pretty bad theory of mind and often I have no idea how other people perceive me and my actions although I try my best not to hurt anyone. I try to be as nice as possible to other people but I never know whether someone is interested in what I’m saying or not. So I might come across as selfish although I try not to be that. Social cues fly over my head. I also have no special skills, neither in the arts nor in science or any other field. My social understanding reaches that far that I understand that I‘m not entitled to a relationship and that it is on me to find a partner. That‘s not that far imo. As a coping mechanism I hug my stuffed animals and have imaginary girlfriends.

So who would want me? Obviously I‘m still young and I haven‘t lost hope however I find it hard to imagine that there could be someone who says: „I love this person“ in relation to me. I‘ve read that working out is a good idea however I‘ve been at a gym at my old school and it really bored me so now I try running in the woods everyday (6-10km everyday // depends on my mood). And I also read that one should be „working on themselves“ but I don‘t think I really understand what this means. Could anyone please explain what this could mean, especially in my case? And how do I talk to other people as I‘m very socially awkward and quite anxious as well (I never really talked to people in school // only the teachers after the lessons because I liked them)? Like, how do I initiate a conversation, maintain it and progress if I‘m talking to a girl I like in a romantic way without feeling as though I‘m falling through a hole in the ground and dissociating? There may not be a general „recipe“ for this but tips would still be appreciated. 
And last but not least: Can anyone relate this? Some empathy would be appreciated as well as I‘m quite lonely and a bit sad :) .

General advice is welcome too as I‘m pretty oblivious to most things that are related to relationships.

We’ve spent a day or two reconciling, but I still feel as though we don’t agree on some things.

One of the points that was brought up that I “have no excuse” because *I am medicated*. This point was kind of irritating to hear because I have expressed to him that I only take my medication (Adderall) on days that I’ll need it — because it’s summer and I have no uni classes, I don’t take it at all unless there’s something important that day that I’ll need to focus on. That has always been how I treat my medicines if I am told by my doctor that it is acceptable to do so, which is the case here.

And we were in the shopping center. While being in one of the shops, I spotted my ex. We broke like a year ago, but we broke up, because we didn't talk, what I need in a relationship. We didn't communicate enough... so I spotted her and we made eye contact a couple of times. When we made eye contact, I felt something in my chest. And I remembered all the memories I had with her. So when I got home, I checked her IG profile and she was posting some dudes, so I stalked them (what is weird thing to do for me, since I'm not that kind of person). And I thought, maybe I didn't got over her and I missed her? But the thing is, that when she was in a relationship w another guy, she DM'd me. We chatted for a bit and that's it. Well, that DM was a bit random :Ddddd so here's the thing. Right now, I'm spending some time with another girl, but I still remember her and I have this feeling in my chest, which I can't get when I'm around with that new girl. So my question is, what should I do? Do I still have feelings for her? 


P.S I don't think that I imagine my future with that new girl, but I don't have balls to tell her that.

I’m wondering what I could be doing wrong. 

With the latest guy, we have so many things in common, fantastic conversation, we laugh and have loads of fun, and then he ends up talking about the girl he just started dating (and all the doubts he has about her, like that she’s not into what he’s into and definitely doesn’t want the things in life that he definitely wants, etc etc). I’m there like, oh good, another guy who wants to be my best friend and tell me all his dating woes. 

The time before, it was a mutual friend and I really thought there was a strong attraction there and that something was going to happen (I actually asked about it here). Eventually I got tired of not knowing and asked him what the deal was, and he said he was so flattered and thought it was “beautiful” that I put myself out there, but saw me as a friend. (Months later we got really drunk and some sexual stuff happened, so I’m still confused about that one because I think he is attracted to me, but I’m apparently only good enough for a one night stand I guess. We’re still friends, we hang out very regularly.)

I don’t think I’m unattractive. I’ve dated lots of people, had what I consider to be a normal number of serious relationships, but the last year I’ve been single I’ve not had much luck. I’ve been on a few dates, not been really drawn to any of them, and only from the apps, nothing organic.

What’s wrong with me?!

I am fit (I lift weights and am curvy/strong so I know it’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but I’m not at all manly, I have a small waist and feminine curves). I’m always getting compliments on my long hair, my clear skin, my style. I’ve worked on myself a ton and am mentally healthy, fun to be around, successful in my career, great social life. 

But it feels like every guy who I am attracted to and would like to date just sees me as a friend or a bro or something. They tell me I’m hilarious, intelligent, interesting, kind. I’m kind of sick of being those things to be honest. I love my male friends and I’m glad they like me as a person, but I don’t want to be some sexless buddy forever. I want someone wonderful to fall the fuck in love with me. And I feel like nobody is seeing what I have to offer.

She was controlling and tried to isolate me from my friends as much as possible (I even had a curfew !!!). The relationship didn’t last too long, especially since she graped me (yes dudes can be graped; no she never had my consent, i woke up to her on top of me and i was too weak from being drunk to push her off of me, and she never stopped even though i begged).

After that i dated someone who started off nice (we were friends first) and she said she had an abusive ex as well; we bonded over that and eventually started dating. She really helped me get started in my career, so i was loyal to her. Eventually, i noticed a lot of lies and deceit. She also began to exhibit the same behaviors as the previous person, but i honestly just thought that that is what a relationship was like. Eventually i left her after some gold digging (she claimed that she did uber, but the landlords always saw her come right back to the house not long after leaving). She then proceeded to tell anyone who would listen that i graped her in front of my nephew (I DON’T HAVE A NEPHEW). But, I’m a muscle bound intimidating black guy and she was a tiny little Asian women, no one believed anything from my side until months (with some people YEARS) later they noticed inconsistencies in the story, plus she claimed the guy she dated after me (who she used to beat on, i later learned) did the same exact things as me. 

After her i dated a lady who honestly was a great person until a year into our relationship she cheated on me repeatedly. The dude she cheated with is a friend of mine now and we get beers sometimes.

Later that night I get a text from her saying, thanks for the meal and I was super sweet. We exchanged some basic conversation and eventually I  decided to ask her out to get some food later this week. She said yes and we set the date. 

My question, and I may be completely over thinking this.. But is that weird? I feel like a creep for some reason, ik if this happened to my sister I'd be super weirded out for her safety..

The timing really sucks because he’s going off for his last year of uni in September and he’ll be 830 miles away. We just met in June but we’re really into each other.

I told him how I felt (that I wanted it to continue past summer, but was open to seeing where it goes) and we posed the situation like it was us vs the problem, rather than what I wanted vs what he wanted. It really eased the tension because it felt like we were holding back a little bit.

He said that he was afraid we would be too busy to be as attentive as we’d need to be for a committed relationship and I agreed (I’m transferring to a new uni and he’s studying for the mcat), so we’re just going to see each other until the end of summer, then reassess to see if we want to remain noncommittally in touch while he’s up at school.

I haven’t had sex yet and we’ve been getting more intimate lately, I just don’t really know how to tell him and don’t want to scare him off, because I trust him and wouldn’t mind him being my first despite the unfortunate situation.

She invited me in to her appartment and we chilled a little in the couch. She managed to have a decent conversation then. Guess she is more comfortable at home. After a few hours break we went for a late evening walk and decided to sit at a lake, dipping our toes in the water. She suggested we take a bath. I just told her ""you first"". After about 10 minutes of thinking she stripped her clothes off and jumped into the lake. I did the same thing. I was really thinking that if I was going to kiss her it was right there but she didnt go in too deep. I was in the middle of the lake by the time she was in. And she got freezing cold.
