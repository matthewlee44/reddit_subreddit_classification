&amp;#x200B;

\- Desire to date someone wealthy ONLY ;

\- Refusal to date someone middle class, lower class ;

\- Choosing their partners based on their race ;

\- Believe in stereotypes ;

\- Caring about personal social image ; jealousy of others' relationship ;

\- Dating to fill a temporary void, which ends up in a short relationship ; 

\- Leading on someone's feeling just to feel ""wanted"", needed attention ;

\- Selfishness ;

&amp;#x200B;

I believe there are more points, but don't get me wrong, I feel like DATING and LOVING is hard to find nowadays, someone who understands you, who will be with you no matter what, someone who will be support you and your goals etc... It's not impossible to find, but it's just that people are being more picky.

&amp;#x200B;

The desire to date someone wealthy only, and refusal to date a middle/lower class individual is beucase nowadays everything is related to money, and people are lazy, they are depending on their S.O  to do their work so they can slack at home and do nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Choosing their partners based on their races is mainly related to stereotypes, which were built on over time. White people are on top of the dating chart, because they are considered as successful, wealthy, which is why a lot of non-caucasians are ONLY into white people, in CERTAIN case some of their family could also put the idea into their kids' brain at an early age (based on a lot of Filipino friends, where their parents always tell them to date a white man/ white women if possible) ;

Asian women are believed to be ""submissive"", I apologize for the term but this is what I've heard and seen from discussion ;

Black men are fetishized nowadays, because the stereotype is that they are ""taller and bigger"" in every aspects, and that they are athletic ;

I haven't heard much negative things about black women, so I can't say anything about it ; 

Asian men are not ""manly enough"", they are ""smaller"" in every aspects ; 

&amp;#x200B;

The 4 last points that I said are mainly leading to a toxic relationship, always hurts someone in the relationship, making them lose faith in dating, it could lead to short relationships, cheating, and many other NEGATIVE points

&amp;#x200B;

DISCLAIMER : don't get me wrong, i support dating the same race, and interracial couples, I support dating someone wealthy. I'm just saying that dating nowadays looks way much more superficial because people are being selective on who they want to talk to, have a relationship with.

That might he messaged me telling me how he forgot about all his problems even if it was for a few hours. I responded back to him. Then after two weeks of total silence he messaged me saying he feels a lot better and apologised for his late texts etc. We spoke for a few days but he didn’t respond after a week of talking. There was a religious holiday two weeks ago which he sent me a message on. But after that again nothing. I’m so emotionally exhausted.

I’ve been dating someone casually for just over 6 months. We get along really well, and have insane amounts of fun, whether we’re out on adventures or home just watching tv. I’ve asked her a few times in the past if she thinks we have the potential to be something serious in the future, because at this point in my life, if I’m going to invest time into someone, I’d like it to be for something serious. 

Her response to that is, “I don’t really see a future for us because you’re not Christian”. 

I grew up without parents that were religious. I never went to church, never prayed, etc. To her, it’s really important that she can only be with someone else who is Christian, to the point that even her mom commented, “you guys would be so perfect for each other, except for the fact that he’s not Christian”. 

As a non Christian, I have a hard time understanding that someone would turn down happiness just because the person they’re with isn’t Christian. I’m not satanic, or against religion, and even told her I’d go to church with her to make her happy, but I highly doubt that I’d ever have the desire to be religious, it’s just something I’m not into.

This morning around 10:30am she sent him a nice text asking if he is still ok to meet up later today and she got no response at all !!! All day ?! What is up with that ? 
It’s not like we are the type that is in a young age group where it’s normal to ghost? Like 30s? I would think most men are mature adults by then ?Come on. What’s the reason you think he’d do this?

I usually read some hot topics, yet I feel I'm kindda naive when it comes to dating. I had like small dates, and girls found me interesting till they found out that I haven’t been in a real relationship nor hookup. 

The back story is that I grew up in a conservative community. For example, men and women are segregated almost everywhere, and families might find dating shameful and sinful. The only way to have a relationship is by the arranged marriage. The problem is that my parents decide who I marry depending on their prefrences and relationship with the girl or her family, which sucks bc they might have different perspectives from what I want, like my mother is looking for the miss beauty there, lmao, but I just want a friendly and intelligent girl with an average looking, so I lied to her that I don't want to get married bc I'm not ready financially. Nowadays, I live abroad in a very open-minded and modern community that embraces diverse ethnicities and sexual orientations.

I tried different online dating apps like tinder, and I dated a girl. Yet, I ended the relationship after the first date as I told her that I’m interested in a short-term relationship, and she wants marriage bc she doesn't want to have sex before marriege. In addition, I tried another app for the LGBTQ community but still no luck either.

Last year,  I(M18) got in a relationship with a girl(F20) that i knew for a long time and it ended after a few months due to quarantine + long distance, but most importantly because I wasn’t ‘‘doing enough’’. This year I was really busy/stressed out with school so I didn’t date anyone since. However, I tried analysing that previous relationship to figure out what went wrong. 

When we were together she often said that I was not doing any efforts to please her (compliments, etc.), which is true in the sense that I don’t really express myself verbally and me not being the most enthusiast through online conversations didn’t help, but I tried. When I’m stressed out, it’s even worse. Having her pressure me to act the way she wanted me to, made it even harder for me to communicate (basically a vicious cycle…you get the point). 

What confuses me is that she knew I was like that from the start, but still decided to get in a relationship. I saw her as a really independent girl before we got together so I wasn’t expecting her to “need” compliments 24/7 to feel reassured.  
 

Anyways, what I’m trying to say, or ask, is what’s the point of dating someone if you want them to change as soon as you get in the relationship ? Of course there’s going to be more intimacy, but the main components of the two persons will stay the same, right?

Love doesn't die a natural death.


It dies because we grow in different directions and we no longer want or are willing to strive towards the same things


It dies because of lies and cover up. When we inflict jealousies and inappropriate behaviors. The explosive confessions after a fog of suspicion.


It dies because its impossible to divide the heart over multiple partnerships. That feeds indifference. And its a testament of character.


It dies due to starvation from crumbs of affection and attention. Crumbs of smiles. Crumbs of happiness.


It dies due to stagnation. Love is dynamic and alive ever growing and developing. When you no longer wish to explore new interest together, love will coil around someone who will.


It dies from abuse, cruel words, non pleasing acts and from over possessiveness. All these states invite resentment.


It takes more than love to keep love alive. Midnight never strikes two hearts at the same time. One will always love more than the other. The one who loves less stops protecting the one who loves more. Remember my reddit reader. Love is not words. You can proclaim love and treat that person badly. Love is not a feeling. Your feelings can change over the course of breakfast, plus love comes with a drop of pain and fear. Love is behavior. What you do. What you show.


We have become sexually frivolous and confuse desire with love. Sex and desire are elements of love just as hot water is not soup.


Remember the vow. Remember the reason for the vow. The wisdom behind the vow.


To honor and cherish my mate in good times and bad. Please grasp the wisdom. Good times destroys sometimes faster than bad times. Look at the mess celebrities create. In sickness and in health. A vain man always working out or woman looking for a boob job has a drop of poison. Health can destroy. In want and in plenty. Wealth becomes tools of dominance, and that is anti love. Love is an equalizer in that it can reduces a king to kneel and marry a peasant. To forsake all others. This one really confused people and I will not get into this.. All others. All ,not except...


But love does not die naturally. When you allow yourself to get familiar and boring. When you allow your passion to wane. When you reach the point when you believe your mate isn't worth fighting for.. You murder your love.

I’m 25. I don’t want to party and be a degenerate until I’m 30 and realize I’m all alone. I want to find my forever person and get married in a few years.

I may not be a “traditional woman” as I sleep on first dates, but it’s just to test things out, since sex is very important to me in a LT relationship. 

I am pretty well off from myself alone. I have a gig in accounting and I’m getting mY CPA next year and hope to own my own firm. I do really well for myself at my age. And I still want a man I can take care of and cook dinner for, as long as he’s sweet and shows me he loves me. 

hook up culture is so garbage. I am successful, beautiful, intelligent, funny, and a hoot!!! Not to brag ok!! I’m just frustrated! Men I’ve been on dates with DO enjoy my company (and the sex), but it’s the appeal of getting around that never makes them settle.

I'm usually a background character, and spend a lot of time alone. I also dealt with really bad anxiety but I've learned to over come it just recently by going to therapy, and I can approach I don't even know and have an actual conversation. I also have Asperger's, so sometimes conversations feel weird to me, or I just act/say things that might be weird in the situation. Because of all of this, I turned to online dating once I started college.

I was on and off on tinder (and other dating apps, but used tinder more often), and actually got matches and even some dates. Though I went on dates, I never felt a genuine connection once I met them in person.

Im giving up on dating apps mainly because it's challenging getting matches and when I do get matches most of them never reply, and most connections I make with people never feel natural or genuine to me.

Now that Ive graduating, it seems that I've missed out on opportunities to find someone. I'm almost 23 and haven't even had any kind of relationship. I take care of myself and my looks, I have lots of cool hobbies and I'm even a D1 athlete. My friends always are so curious how I've never been in a relationship, and whenever they ask I don't know how to answer. 

Anyways, not using dating apps makes me feel like getting a date will be exponentially harder if not something that shouldn't waste my time on. Which is fine, currently I've been doing my own thing and have been stress free. But for those who have moved passed online dating, how did you manage approaching people in real life?

Right now, no one in my immediate group of people that I know seems like a good fit for me and I'm just not attracted to them.

And a matter of fact there is a convention that my town does every summer and there are always tons of people there, and so I decided to go there with my family and we all kind of just split and did our own thing, my parents were just visiting, my siblings went shopping, and I was just wandering around and I could have been talking to girls that I like who are somewhere around my age but I didn’t because I didn’t know if I should, I mean the cute girls that I saw were either with their parents, a group of friends, or their boyfriend.
And also even before school ended I found some cute girls but I just couldn’t find the best times to talk to them because I was either listening to the teacher, getting some schoolwork done, and even during lunchtime I couldn’t really find time to talk to girls because not only are they with their friends but I’m also with mine too.
So overall I think I’m confident enough to talk to a girl but I just don’t know the best time to talk to a girl.
So can someone please give me some advice because this is extremely frustrating for me.

First off let me say I’m a insecure and jealous person it didn’t start until this year but growing since last year.

So most of this is my fault I take the blame
FOR STAYING and over thinking. we work warehouse I work my ass off he does the same but this is where our issues are I asked to quit he was like we are not gone make it Bc I’m not gonna text you cause I’m at work. So from there I just knew deep down he didn’t care but he says he do and the last argument was recent ended with him saying “I can’t be myself”. Let me say this first he can call a female coworker baby girl(he say he never did it but I sat right there while he said it).second he can take them to lunch without telling his girlfriend( I only saw it Bc I was walking outside and he asked me a question in his car and they are chilling in the car). Third he can take knifes out their back pocket you know cause who cares you know NOT ME. Fourth he can give another girl his jacket who cares NOT ME i just won’t wear his jackets again ever in in this relationship -big smile-. And last but not least my favorite one if a girl is extra friendly and little flirty why not egg it on and think it’s fine cause you know your GIRLFRIEND not insecure and jealous at all. And then you got My dumb ass sitting through all off it knowing if I bring it up I will be called insecure and childish and that I need to grow up. I’m (20f)now we started off when I was 19 he is (30m). Now let get into my case if a guy ask me to buy him food (but he pays me back) imma tell my boyfriend about never a time I didn’t do that or he didn’t know cause you know ✨RESPECT✨ HAHA🙄 I don’t play like that you know off gate I have somebody. So now everything that’s happening is  breaking me down I’m like he can do something else traumatic (to me) or maybe I’m overreacting but I want to quit cause at some points I want to break a leg or arm so I don’t have to come back to work.Also I don’t have to argue what he did or said to some girl.

I noticed usually she would usually do her work duties near me in a certain area of the gym, kinda following me subtly around the gym, so a few days ago I finally said screw it, and made a stupid joke as she passed by, to which she responded positively.

Today as I was leaving she was smiling at me and she said a comment on a previous conversation we had.  I took this as an invitation to stop and chat for a few minutes.  She has supermodel looks so its difficult for me to hold eye contact with her.  I'm shy what can I say, but today decided to open up to her a little and told her why I am in the gym and what my goals are. The problem is she responded with only a few words, and really didn't seem to want to engage in the conversation.

So I guess at this point, since she seems friendly but not too receptive or interested in what I was saying, perhaps its time to back off.  Then again, she could be shy just like I am.

But here’s some potential signs he likes me.

- He texts me almost everyday and we call/FaceTime each other for hours. The other day we FaceTimed until 2 am.

- I once saw him at school for the first time in a while and his face lit up.

- He called me beautiful. Basically when we were calling he wanted me to turn my camera on and I was like, “So you can see my beautiful face” as a joke but then he actually said that I was beautiful.

- He said that we should hang out at my house soon.

- When we call, his brother sometimes comes in and calls me his gf to tease him, so possibly his bro knows he likes me.

- He teases me a lot.

So those are the potential signs, please tell me if you think he likes me and any advice on how I should ask him would he appreciated.

But I'm just not a social person. I have looked to join co-ed sports, but I know I wouldn't really talk to anyone, and I don't drink anymore, so hanging out after wouldn't be enjoyable for me since people this age largely drink to be social.

I'm very introverted, and I don't generally like a lot of people. I would say at this point in my life, not having gone to college, that I have only 1 real friend, which I am perfectly happy with. It's not that I can't socialise, or am unfriendly with people, I am just not a people person. I have trouble continuing small talk and just find it to be very forced.

This is why I want online dating to work better for me. I just have time to actually think about the small talk. Every couple months (about) I'll get one match that I like talking to, and feel like I can manage small talk better. But they never want to go on a date (just coffee or something small and quick) and eventually stop responding.

I've only dated one girl for like a week and a half when I was 16. The most recent girl I was talking to from dating apps stopped responding over a week ago, but for weeks we would text a bunch every day, and talk on the phone about once a week. She was clear early in that she didn't know what she was looking for, so I didn't pressure her to go in a date, just talked and we had a lot of the same views if the world and future plans.

I just don't know how to meet someone when my only real friend and his girlfriend are also not into social activities. I am generally fine being single, but every once and a while it just sinks in that I'm alone, and the only time I felt romantic touch was 7 years ago. the only physical touch I get is hugging my mom goodbye about once a week, and petting my non cuddley dog.

TLDR: I'm feeling very down and alone because I am very introverted, but want someone special in my life. I have one real friend that I am very happy with, but sometimes I just want more.

Afterwards we spent a ton of time sending memes to each other and planning the next date but I got a message from her saying yesterday that she decided to go exclusive with someone else and really wanted to still be friends with me. I know its 100% fair for her to move on with someone else but I feel really glum as she was the first girl that I've met online who wanted to see me again after a first date in over three years I've been dating online. I don't know if its even worth staying in the friendzone with her as I really want to see her happy but I don't want to drag my heart through any more heartbreak, it might just be easier to just rip the bandage off and move along. \*Sigh\* I am happy for her but yeah I am sad lol.

So I went on a date with someone I met online and I think we had a great time. She seemed pretty interested in meeting me after a few days of us messaging each other and when we did meet our date was almost three hours long. She said I was really funny and she was laughing a lot during. We did both have to cut the our time short since we had to work in the morning but the date ended with us kissing and she texted me when she got home. I’m not sure if she is still interested although she did mention something about our encounter over text. 

Anyways, I didn’t know that the date would go well so I didn’t think to tell her I would be going out of town the following week. It’s been a few days now and I haven’t replied to her text. My flight is in a few days and my acne has been acting up so I’m not sure if I should see her before I leave or wait until I’m back in town. It will have been two weeks since our first date if I wait to see her after my trip. 

What’s the best move here? Call, text?
