0,qz9qjy,1637544664,First OLD in several years,"I accepted an invitation for drinks from a guy nearby about 8 hours after getting back on Bumble. 
It was a local place where I felt safe meeting a stranger. Over the course of one drink, I learned that he doesn't drink (but suggested meeting for a drink), but whatever. I also learned that he ended a 10 year relationship only 6 months ago, and they still live together partially in one of his homes. She wished him luck on our date, you know, because he left for it from their shared home. They still work out together daily. Ok, still...is he supposed to throw her out in the middle of a pandemic? I can be cool. I'm sure it will eventually evolve, right?
Oh, and they broke up because she got ""really religious"", and no longer wanted to participate in their swinger lifestyle, which he admits she was never really into. And her religious awakening came after they had their third miscarriage. Oh, then sometime before this morning he sent me a picture that some  girl sent him of her boobs hanging out of a schoolgirl uniform, along with his reply that he was on a date and thanking her for the photo. He said it was a booty call and he wasn't interested. I told him she has great boobs and he should be flattered if she wants anything from him. 
All I can think about is how I hope his ex girlfriend has really good friends, because this guy is a walking trauma.

You are fortunate that someone wants to invest in you. You should be kind. You should show compassion and just be a kind human.   You never know what will happen tomorrow and you don’t know what will turn out.  Everyone has there limits and everyone has there pasts.  Just be kind.

8,qzcqcb,1637554483,Anyone else in a companionship situation? Is this more normal when dating in your 40’s?,"I (41F) have been dating a man (47M) for over 2 years now. 

We are both busy and independent.  We maintain our own homes, have careers and we are actively raising our own kids. I have a full social life and like spending time with friends. He has very little free time due to a demanding position and his kids activities. 
We make time to see each other once a week. 

We are exclusive, we love each other, we have fun together, similar values and humor. The sex is great. He is kind, patient, respectful, treats me well, listens and makes me feel heard. 

The possible downside, we live completely separate lives. He has met a few of my friends and family. His small circle of family and friends know about me, but he rarely sees them.  What little time we have together we prefer to spend alone. 

Neither one of us wish to introduce a significant other to our kids. Neither one of us wants to get married again. 

So what is the problem?  I guess I am struggling with what I (and the world) think I should want or have vs what actually works for me right now.  

I generally like our arrangement, but sometimes I wish we could spend a little more time together.  He has no more time to give.  We don’t talk about long term plans, there are just too many variables.  People will say, your significant other should make you their priority.  We are each a consideration for the other, but work and kids are the priority.  
At times our situation makes me feel insecure or unanchored, like, where is this going to go?  But then, who ever knows what the future will bring?

I don’t even know what I am really asking, but is anyone else in a similar situation?  I’d love to hear from others who can relate. My friends are all either married or younger and dating kid free and think our arrangement is odd.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qzcqcb/anyone_else_in_a_companionship_situation_is_this/

14,qzn01a,1637592356,Keeping up your confidence when you feel the person you're seeing is 'out of your league'.,"This truly isn't meant to be a humble-brag, but I'm wondering if anyone else out there is or has been in a similar situation? It's like a double edged sword!

I'm [43M] seeing a woman [41] who I fairly consistently have to talk myself down from her being out of my league and freaking out. Or, at least, I'll acknowledge she may very well be out of my league but try and focus on the fact that she's still responding positively as I try and progress things towards a relationship and hopefully she'll let me know if she stops 'feeling it'. Until that happens I should just enjoy our time together.

I'm about two years out of a 10 year relationship which included three years of marriage. My ex was seven years younger than me and let's just say it wasn't an equal partnership and she was quite controlling, jealous, lacked friends or close relationships to family, made decisions that led her to be financially dependent on me, and was emotionally abusive. 

The new woman has a pretty important job with a very well known college and she's just super smart, talented, independent, and attractive. She's a trained musician and has a lot of current and former colleagues who are also trained musicians, and many of them are male. She has expressed in casual conversation that she feels like it's good to get out of social 'bubbles' and doesn't feel like being surrounded by a homogeneous group of people is very fulfilling, so I remind myself of that when I start to think 'Gee, wouldn't she rather be with someone that can talk music with her?'. I know close to nothing about music, but I would be willing to learn! 

So maybe my different background and interests are more attractive to her than being with someone that shares more of her own? After all, she's been surrounded by fellow musicians and the musically inclined since she was in high-school and yet she was still on a dating app in August, haha. Plus, I can understand that just because there are shared interests doesn't mean there will be attraction. And if she needs to geek out on music she has plenty of people she can do so with AND still be interested in me romantically.

Fortunately, for my confidence, I have a fairly important job at a well known cultural institution so I don't feel completely mismatched professionally. Not that there aren't many successful relationships where the two partners have very different professions or are at different places in their respective careers. It's just something I can remind myself of when those negative automatic thoughts crop up.

So yeah, every once and a while I feel a little exhausted from giving myself pep talks or suffering from imposter syndrome but never when I'm with her. I haven't expressed any of this to her as I feel like that's sort of a weird needy psychological game to play, looking for reassurances. I think I have it under control, but felt like expressing it so this turned into more of a journaling session for me! Maybe it was an interesting read for someone. Maybe someone can relate. Maybe it helped someone gain perspective on a similar situation they are in.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/qzn01a/keeping_up_your_confidence_when_you_feel_the/

25,r05v9e,1637645204,Dating After Rape - Not anytime soon -,"It happened in March. The man is over a decade my junior and a platonic friend of 6 months that called me ""mom"" sometimes. We went to brunch with another friend one Sunday and got drinks after. It was probably my first time really drinking since the pandemic. I really liked these friends at the time. I couldn't drive home. He told the other friend he'd take care of me.

Anyhow, I was determined to face it and do my best to move on. Therapy, the criminal justice system, friends, volunteering, hobbies - it truly hasn't been horrible. Except. I. Feel. Horrible. 

My determination wore thin, my momentum - is almost gone. Maybe it's the holidays and I'm tired, but I am not sure how I can trust anymore. My ex-husband wasn't a ""bad"" guy, but we weren't great for each other. He ended the marriage, and I felt like maybe I did something wrong. He told me no, I didn't, but I lost trust in myself. Ten years we were together. 

I questioned my judgment, regarding my husband, regarding this friend. It's been almost five years since the divorce. I focused on building friendships, being good at my job, taking care of my aging mom. I really enjoy volunteering. Maybe I'm not cut out for a relationship. But boy, I know I want one. Pre-pandemic, I thought one day I'd find someone to be good to, for a long time. Maybe even a long, long time. Now I just wish there was someone to cry to. It's hard being ""strong,"" moving through all this police, legal shit, working long hours, maintaining my goddamned composure. Everyone knows me to be a mega-goofball, but lately, it's hard to smile. Men think I'm pissed. I'm not. Every time someone speaks to me, I take good care to look them in the eye when we speak and let them know how glad I am that we spent time together.

I'm average-looking, but here and there, I get stopped by strangers saying how incredibly beautiful I am. Usually it's a gay, lesbian or transexual person. I'll be 44 this March. I can't imagine what sort of man would be patient with someone like me. I'm still coming into my own. I wonder what people see when they see me, and if I matter. Now that this man has been arrested, it may take 1 - 3 years until a grand jury decides if we go to trial. 

I hope everyone here is taking good care of themselves. Maybe we'll never be ""with anyone"" ever again, but all we have are each other and we have to be good to one another. I hope you find happiness in something out there.

After a couple of first dates that didn’t go anywhere, I had first dates within a week with S and the C.  I’ve had 4 dates with S and on the 3rd date the goodnight kiss escalated and we spent the night together.  We have plans to get together again this weekend

I’ve had a couple of dates with C and we have plans for a 3rd date this weekend as well.   Things haven’t gotten physical with C yet but based on how the banter is going it’s on both our minds.

They’re quite different people and I enjoy spending time with them both for different reasons.

There’s been no questions asked or info given with either woman on being exclusive, or if any of us are dating others, I have no idea if they are although S has been super busy at work and wouldn’t have had time.

That said, it is starting to feel to me like I’m not doing the right thing to keep progressing things with two women, am I just being a dinosaur and I need to get with the times, how do people handle this kind of thing these days?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/r0qake/how_to_handle_dating_multiple_people/
47,r0qp04,1637711081,Seeking perspectives from those who were alone for a long time and then met someone they really liked,"TL;DR: The guy I've been dating for a few months put up some unexpected walls, referencing being alone a long time, I'm confused and want perspective from those who are used to being alone. Afraid? Need a lot of space and worried about losing it? Worried about opening the heart?

A few months back I started dating a guy I'd known for a while (I've written about him previously). At first it seemed he was somewhat ambivalent but then one day a switch seemed to flip and we've been dating steadily for a few months.  Not fast, just steady.  He still talks about how he wants to go very slow, and he's been alone for a long time, gotten used to it and sort of built his life around it, so timing is a little challenging (from his perspective). I'm in no hurry myself but do really like him.

So, things had been going really great and I shared a piece of writing with him that was me opening up about how I experienced a tender moment with him and how I saw our developing relationship.  I used a lot of language around going slow, staying in the 'shallows' (lots of water metaphors in the writing) , taking time, us being sovereign entities who are flowing together.  He's an avid reader and writer himself so I thought he'd appreciate it. It kind of backfired.  


His message back indicated that he loved the writing but saw it as very deep and heavy, and that he's on a slower path, and referenced being alone for so long and a tendency to need to be solo, but really liking how we fit together.  He said that I come on strong (but didn't say how) and going fast makes him nervous.  It wasn't a good time to dive into it b/c he left to travel internationally (which he'd invited me on but i couldn't go),  and is on yet another trip starting today for a week. 

A couple weeks prior he'd written me a message about how he's grateful we are together and that it feels like a fire that burns a long time, like a ""good oak fire"", not a paper fire that is hot and heavy and burns out.  Really, really sweet.  Then some really flirty texts the next week about a thousand things he likes about me.

But then after my writing and his reply he's been quite sparse in his communication. He's been traveling a lot and I saw him kind of unexpectedly today. I asked if we were good and he said yes, but that it's just the same stuff he mentioned at the beginning when we first started dating (finally okay being alone). Then a big hug and a kiss, but he had to go.  

Here's where I want perspective: This whole ""I'm used to being alone"" thing has come up a few times, and I know that I can't change his perspective/attitude on where he's at, but it just seems weird to me that you'd maybe put up mental barriers to flow of a relationship b/c you are so used to being alone.  It seems like when I take any forward movement it triggers this. He has mentioned wanting to not get super hurt again. But isn't that all of us?

I've not been alone nearly as long as he has (dating a lot since divorce 8 yrs ago but nothing more than 6 months max, but lots of trying on his part).  


It's making me question what I feel when we are together b/c we have such a great time, so natural, and easy and he's mentioned things like me meeting his family and has invited me to Cancun and Kauai.  So I don't even get why he has to keep mentioning these things an pulling back.  I  have never mentioned being in a hurry whatsoever, and NEVER mention things like marriage or even broaching the topic of being ""in love"" (I'm not there yet, that is something I do really slowly, esp at this age).

For those who are used to being alone, does finding someone you really like freak you out when they reveal that they like you, or when they want something? 

&amp;#x200B;

I also have a tendency to want to see the bright side of my relationships, so trying to look more objectively at this. Is it a red flag that he keeps mentioning the whole ""I'm used to being alone"" mindset.

We will have a talk when he gets back but I'm really thrown off.  If he's an avoidant person that just won't work for me (does that approach work for anyone) unless we can work through it together.

&amp;#x200B;

I have one sister who is currently not speaking to me and another who I have typical ups/downs with but we mostly get along. I actually sent notes to two of the four estranged sibs recently simply expressing it seems pointless and we don't need to be best friends, but it would be nice to at least know what's going on in each other's lives; haven't heard from either. All but one of us live in/around the same city. 

With the holidays upon us, I'm feeling kind of embarrassed if the new guy in my life starts asking about family, plans for Thanksgiving/Christmas. I'm doing counseling currently (have done so on/off for decades) and I'm confident it's not me (like I'm not the common denominator among these multiple dysfunctional relationships). But I fear that may be an interpretation. I don't like to go into great detail because I don't want to sound negative or judgmental and also it involves sexual trauma that I just don't want to rehash, especially if he will never meet this brother in person.

Some of these matches don’t even wait for the initial hello. They just insist on having it. Or they ask and I say “not yet” and they wait maybe an hour or so and ask AGAIN. I have blocked so many because of this. I’m super frustrated because most seem like they’d be potentially good matches.

53,r0vdfh,1637724982,I think it might be over.,"Worried we are going to break up.

We had an argument last night on the phone.  Together 6 months, we love each other, no question.  He has not met my children yet.  It’s hard to summarize but essentially here is what happened.

I’m struggling with some pretty big issues with both of my children right now, and I’ve learned to lean on my BF for support, which he has been truly amazing with.  I do the same for him.  Unfortunately, unforeseen circumstances occurred after we’d been dating for a few months and I’ve needed it more than he has.  However.  One thing that has come up before is that he will listen to my concerns/fear/pain, then what it at least feels like to me, he will then launch into advice.  Does he give good advice when I ask for it?  Absolutely, without question.  But in this convo last night, I was just feeling my children’s pain and I needed a shoulder, not to be coached.  Which I feel like he was doing, so I asked him if he was giving me advice because he thinks I don’t already know these things or haven’t already done them?  He was offended and amongst other things intimated that I focus on the negative, and as my committed partner he is allowed to speak his thoughts without me being defensive.  That hurt because I’ve kept my chin up and have come through adversity with positivty and strength, and I have worked hard to ensure I move through my life without bitterness and resentment.  I show up for him and our relationship.  I open up to him when he prods me to do so (and also when I want to) and that trust has slowly built over time.  I am old enough to realize men and women communicate and process matters of the heart differently.  He’s solution oriented.  I’ve raised my children alone for 8 years, and I am not knowing exactly how
to navigate someone sharing their opinions on how to handle things on the home front.  But I’m really trying.

Today we texted good morning and nothing else, which is clear to me he’s upset (we usually text throughout the day and speak on the phone more or less every day).  I texted to say I was sorry for last night, and was he wanting space tonight?  His response was simply “yup”.  He has told me before when I’m not receptive to his thoughts it tells him I’m not committed an actual relationship, because this is part of being in one.  I’ve told him I need time to adjust to a new person in my life even having an opinion.  Again, this isn’t the first time this type of conflict has come up.  Overall we are very compatible, couple hiccups along the way as we are both quite headstrong and he is extremely political and I am not, but I think it’s actually a positive thing as we have excellent communication.  But this is… I just don’t know.

I know I’ll survive a breakup.  I don’t want to though, I want to continue to build what we have started because it has been wonderful.

54,r0vkd9,1637725564,Dating with kids = long distance relationship?,"I have kids (grade school).  She has kids (grade school).  We’ve been together only a few months and, of course it makes no sense to combine things yet.  We’ve not even made kid intros yet for fear of setting up a revolving door.  Our schedules are aligned, which means, on average we see each other once a week to once every two weeks.  Travel for work or some other chaos disrupts that cadence.  So basically we’re in a long distance relationship.  How would we be as a fully together couple?  What would it be like if we saw each other daily?  Would we uncover quirks that would bother us, or would it just be the same TOTAL bliss we have when we see each other now, but just more of it?  Seems there is no way to know besides, more time.

How has this type of arrangement played out for you?  How long were you “long distance” before combining forces, and how did things turn out?

He was never a big texter but I’m wondering if this was a blow off or why I’m not starting to feel more certain now that we’ve already hung out 4 times.

* My transfer was approved 2 weeks ago.
* Email last night from Corp. He has not been shortlisted for the position directly above him. 
* His current position will be eliminated. 
* Position below him is open; he is, in fact, conducting the interview with an applicant later today

In the month since the first post, we talked ""around"" our relationship and moving in together, but decided to wait until  we are in person at Christmas.

This is what I said last time:

&gt;Now, he's being weird.  
Says that he'll leave the company if they don't promote him into this specific spot. Says he'll move to another country for better employment opportunities. No mention of our relationship. When we spent a week together in the beginning of October, he expressed concern about his future as he ""approaches 40"" -- he would like to change companies and countries, but ""doesn't know what to do about me.""  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm taking it slowly -- it's been less than 6 hours-- and letting him vent about workplace issues. Asking him about his corporate future. NOT mentioning me or us.

and, this is how is it now:

Now, he's being conversational.  
Says that he'll leave the company if they don't ""fix"" the mess created by eliminating his position. Says he'll move to another city in our current country for better employment opportunities. No mention of our relationship.   
I'm taking it slowly -- it's been less than 12 hours-- and letting him work through workplace issues (including that today he has to interview a person for the spot below him, which technically he should consider!?). I sent him a lengthy email which laid out how I see his choices, and how I feel about each. Verified that I want what is best for him, don't want to pressure, but absolutely want to be in his life.

So there are a lot of reasons why dating is really, really hard for me and why it’s pretty unlikely to happen that often. I’ll spare you for now and cut to the question. 

I’m starting to feel like I’m often the only one in my friends groups, for the past few years at least, who’s not actively dating anyone, never married , etc.  

I have my reasons, like I said. But it just kinda sucks and makes me feel kinda broken and alone the older I get. I feel like I’ve sometimes kinda lost friends to relationships, even if that’s not their intent. For example, I try to meet up with friends at shows and then they bring a date and don’t want to hang out. Or I start seeing way less of them once they’ve “found someone.” I feel like I know people who are almost afraid to be single..? I don’t know what it is.  

But it’s just kinda wearing on me to always be the only single person, the only one going out alone and leaving alone. I am not actively dating, in the sense that if I meet someone in meatspace and things click, cool. But otherwise it’s not a huge priority for me…and I hate how isolating that can be. 

How do you guys deal? I’ve kinda defaulted to being alone and single for really most of my post-college life, for various reasons, and it makes me feel so behind my peers sometimes, or like I will be perceived as being stunted or defective somehow.

UPDATE: we went out last night and came back to my place after a few drink &amp;amp; ended up getting more physical but we both mutually stopped before having sex. He said we didn’t need to rush things &amp;amp; I expressed my boundaries if he’s not ready to date. He explained that it’s more him having his kids nearly full time &amp;amp; wanting to focus on them and doesn’t want to only make time for dating the infrequent times he doesn’t have them. That he’d want to invest more. We kind of left it as we both want to still take it slow and spend time together when we can. I do feel he is being genuine &amp;amp; honest with me as he’s a strong Christian man &amp;amp; I believe stands by his convictions. Would love any opinions on this.
For the record. I’m not putting my life on hold to wait for him. I’m not on a mission to find someone to jump into a relationship with, more about building something healthy &amp;amp; strong. This is by far the healthiest getting to know someone.


Over summer I met a guy on Instagram. We live nearby &amp;amp; have mutual friends. He had just gotten out of a relationship &amp;amp; we both mutually wanted to take things slow &amp;amp; build off a friendship but did express interest in each other.
We talk/text pretty regularly &amp;amp; have gone out a few times. Recently he express the reason he hadn’t kissed me yet was because he wasn’t ready for a relationship but could see himself in one with me.
The next time we went out, we ended up cuddling &amp;amp; kissing a few times. 
We have a lot in common &amp;amp; really connect. I honestly thing that might be what scares him… I want a solid foundation. I’m in no rush &amp;amp; im not closed off to meeting others at this point.
I want to let things happen but at the same time, I don’t want to progress physically if he isn’t really ready to date.
There’s that fine line between taking it really slow &amp;amp; fwb. But I have a strong sex drive so TBH I’d rather go without if the physical isn’t frequent.
I just don’t know how to tell him this.
Basically I’m happy to take it slow &amp;amp; more of a friendship &amp;amp; as much as we have chemistry, I don’t want to be physical unless/until he’s ready to date.

79,r2a9wi,1637885781,"He says sex started on the wrong foot, now I am super insecure","So I met this really great man a short while ago (8 weeks) and he came on very strong in the beginning, with lots of compliments, and plans for the future, like going to another country to see me (not unusual for him, as he has money and his job allows a lot of flexibility). 

In the beginning, I was guarded because of lovebombing experiences in the past, but recently felt that I am opening up more emotionally. His communication is consistent and I am not seeing major red flags. We have not (yet?) said that we are exclusive, see each other once a week and often on another weekend night. First sex was rather awkward because I had too much to drink. This was totally on me. He spanked me after I said I liked it and was very dominant. Has lots of experience with that. Overall it was fine, but here is my problem:

Now he stopped sleeping with me after that one time. Only cuddling two times in a row. He says he feels pressure to behave a certain dominant way, we probably started on the wrong foot, BDSM stuff needs more trust, wants to get to know each other’s bodies better. 

That seems ok but he did not really answer the question if he is sexually attracted TO me, just said “I think you’re attractive”, then mentioned what else he likes like being smart, which sounds kind of different. We could also have vanilla sex instead?!

Great intellectual and emotional connection besides that, but now I feel rejected and insecure, which I told him. There is also a power imbalance in regards to money and age (I am much younger, early forties to his late fifties, and dirt poor compared to him, though happy with what I have and do). 

He has no problems getting it up and I am sure he has people to sleep with. That thought annoys me too because I am not even one of them atm and would also like exclusivity at some point 

I really like him a lot, but this lack of sexual interest has activated some insecurities and I feel out of balance. 

The alternatives: go to concerts etc and cuddle for a few more dates and let him lead, or break it off immediately to protect my ego (which feels he should be ravishing me at this point).",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/r2a9wi/he_says_sex_started_on_the_wrong_foot_now_i_am/

83,r2fgjf,1637903345,"I need your input, I don't know if this is an issue, but it might become one?","I started dating someone a few months ago. we've moved fast and it's been really fun and I'm so excited about this person. they were in a pretty bad relationship a couple years ago, I was also in a pretty bad relationship but it was a bit further back. neither of has had anything serious since our bad relationships until now. we're exclusive, we're in love and express that to each other.


the other day we were having dinner for a special occasion and they brought up their previous partner, it was an off hand statement about them not doing anything like we were doing but it still kind of hit me. they said, x would never have done this for me and I responded with, well x isn't here anymore and went on with the dinner. this has happened in other situations where we're doing something fun and special and they compare the situation to their ex. it's always putting me in a good light but I feel like it taints those experiences. 


we all have a past and we're all dating because it didn't work out with our past partners. we did share our 'trauma', for lack of a better word right now, so I know it was bad for them. I'm so happy that I can make them feel special and I really enjoy doing so. how do I approach this from a respectful position? 


I honestly like that they're comfortable sharing their life with me and I know it's only natural to compare, it's literally party of being human. I want to feel like we can just shed the past and focus on our future but I also know that our past defines how we interact with the world. I don't want to shut them down but I want to navigate this in a way that strengthens our relationship instead of making my partner feel self conscious. I really appreciate any input here. thanks!",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/r2fgjf/i_need_your_input_i_dont_know_if_this_is_an_issue/
84,r2gcuy,1637906587,One thing I like about OLD - proper dates.,"So, in college, living on campus, I don’t recall a lot of actual dates.  And after college, I mostly met men who were somewhat regular at my regular bar or usually already part of my extended social network. I got to know people at that one place and we’d talk enough there and get to know each other over the course of several nights at the bar before we eventually went home together.  No one ever made plans, we were all just there all the time.  If you liked someone, you’d figure out what nights they were most likely to be at the bar and “run into” them.  This is how I met my husband.

It’s not that I never went on dates before OLD, but the vast majority of proper dates I’ve been on have come from OLD.  For all of the myriad of ways OLD sucks, having a well defined, time and location to put on the calendar - to specifically say, I’m setting aside this period of time to get to know this specific person and then getting dressed up to do so…. Even if it’s not a match…. That’s kinda nice.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/r2gcuy/one_thing_i_like_about_old_proper_dates/
85,r2gl6z,1637907426,Girl from Dating App,"So I've been watching tons of videos on this matter and came to this conclusion. Women are too picky. Men are too simps. 

Women are looking for a prince on a horse with financial stability while they post arse pictures on dating apps. Where men don't do jack sheet with their lives and choose to play video games all day without purpose. 

Do you have a dating app? Feels like you can just swipe through people and hope you get a good husband/wife from that. But we all know that both genders talk to at least 10 people on it lol dirty as hell.

Storytime:

I met this chick one time on a dating app, went out with her, and both had a great time. We exchanged numbers and socials. But all of the sudden she went ghost on me. I was being a little beach and freaked out about what went wrong in my head. But then it clicked. She mentioned in one of the conversations that she's too busy all the time, but when I asked with what, she just replied ""I'm just busy"" red flag? Prior to that we had long conversations that never stopped, we talked about anything really, we laughed, we talked serious and silly topics. Sometimes she would be online but chose to not reply. She mentioned multiple times that she lives alone with her dogs and cats and usually just watches TV on her free time. It almost felt like she just wanted attention from a dude whenever she was bored lol The last message I've sent her was, look it's getting too late, if you wanna hang out again, hit me up and we'll plan something out. She seen it but no response.

Then after a while I started working on myself and giving my hobbies more time instead of basically chasing. I posted my work on socials and got great responses from my friends. Then as it seemed she started posting pictures with random dudes in restaurants, which she never did. As a joke I liked one of the pictures and commented ""he must be a great father of yours"", which I got laughs from people. At this point I moved on, worked on my projects, and to my surprise started receiving texts from girls from high school that I used to know. And went with couple to hang out and actually enjoyed my time. Point is, when I stopped concentrating on people and putting them on a pedestal, others would start concentrating on me. Just because I found a purpose to be happy with myself. 

For the girl, I still have her as a friend on social. Why? I'm not sure. We haven't talked at all. I don't seek no ""revenge"" or interested in minding her business. But I see her looking at my stories and such, which she never did before, I was surprised. Do I want her to text again? Kind of. Just to know the reason, but actually don't mention it. But do I want to just move on? Yeah. I guess we'll see, it's all about the time.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/r2gl6z/girl_from_dating_app/

89,r2q7v6,1637941483,Frustration about dating,"I have been dating this woman for a few years now.  We are both single parents and our oldest children are the same age.  She has expressed to me many times that she wants me in her life and that she wants to grow older with me.  We have even joked about getting married and cohabitating together in the future.  All 3 of our kids are best friends and talk with each other almost daily over FaceTime while they play a game called Roblox.   All 3 of our kids have had sleep overs and we have all gone on day trips to the beach as one big family.  It is not like the kids are strangers.   

Now here is the problem.  
She has put so many hard boundaries on me lately that it has become impossible to try and keep track or respect these boundaries.  She only lets me come over when her kid is with his father.   She won’t even text me anymore when her son is hime, which is most of the week, as she has full time custody of her son.  She comes home from work all of the time now and complains that she is exhausted and that she is busy at work.   While she is at work, I see that she is online messaging most of the day as I can see the little green dot that shows she is using Facebook messenger.  
All this changed this year when school started back up in our local area.  
Our relationship now feels like a long distance relationship than what we had just this past summer.  We hardly ever see each other and when we do, she plays on her phone the entire time talking with her BFF girlfriend.   
As I push and try to get back to the close relationship we had earlier this year, she tells me that I am crossing her boundaries and needy.  
I can understand about respecting boundaries, but is seems that we were closer at one point and that she has systematically distanced herself just over the last few months.   I have tried to express my desire and respectfully brought this up in conversation a few times.  And every time I try and talk about this, she brushes me off and dismisses my conversation.  

Am I being unreasonable for asking to continue being as as we once were?  

At what point do I just have to break it off and move on?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/r2q7v6/frustration_about_dating/

For my part, I never made any moves or pursued anything either. Apparently, he's moved back to town until at least January, but looking to take a job in another city. 

Anyways, I told him I was not going because I'm currently out of town with family until Monday, but asked him if he was living back in town (to keep the convo going).

I have come to realize that I want to put my best foot forward and refresh my photos even though I keep getting burned by OLD and have low expectations. It's probably time to update my professional headshot anyway, and thought, maybe upgrading my dating photos might help? 

I don't have a squad following me around to take photos of me in daily life or when I go on vacation or do active things, so I'm stuck a little bit between meh selfies and potentially overdone photos. 

When browsing, if you see photos that look kind of professional, is that a negative?
