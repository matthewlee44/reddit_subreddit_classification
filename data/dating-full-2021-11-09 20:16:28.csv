Fast forward a few months and I've been in and out of relationships with a few women, mainly sexual. I found out that the girl I like and her boyfriend broke up like 2-3 weeks ago after being together for 2 years, I was over the moon that I might have a chance with this girl since I really, really like her. I then met her again in a pub while being out with some of my friends, she came over to us and started talking to the girl that we know each other through, gave me a hug and said it was nice to see me again. She then went back to her group, and went back and forth between the two groups. She would initiate conversations with me now and then during the night, and I caught her looking at me now and then. Later in the night one of my friends threw up and felt pretty bad, so I walked him out of the pub and gave him some water, asked him if he could walk home (he lived nearby), he said yes. While walking back to the pub, the girl and her friends were standing outside talking and then one of her ""besties"" yelled at me saying ""Do you like (the girls name)?!"", I could see the girl I like waving at her friend like ""NO, NO, DON'T ASK HIM/DON'T TELL HIM"". I just smiled and said ""Yeah"" and walked inside again. Later on I had to draw some fresh air outside and the girl I like noticed me walking out the door and then she asked me where I was going while smiling at me, I just smiled back and said I had to catch some fresh air, she then said ""nah, stay here"" which I for some reason said no to and walked outside. She went home at some point without me noticing. I literally think about her all the time and she's haunting my dreams as well, but I wanna be respectful about it since she has had a hard time after that breakup, and I have no idea if she likes me or not, it's obvious she knows that I like her, she is very much aware of that, I'm just so scared to make any moves since I have no idea if she's ready for a new relationship, and even the thought of starting a conversations with her makes my anxiety spike for some reason, I really don't want to fuck this up, but I'm also scared that if I wait too long, other guys will start going for her as well.

My friend is also a 31-year-old who has never had a serious relationship. He's a bartender, who other women have coined emotionally unavailable.

Why, you ask? To scout out the competition of course, see where I really stood and maybe how I can improve my own profile.

Ok before I give you my scouting report, here's a little preface. I'm a decently average-to-good looking dude (i think). I've had some success in real life, and I do get a few matches a week. But I've never gone on a date from Hinge. It's usually: I open with a funny one-liner or comment on their profile, and we talk for a day or two, and then they evaporate into thin air and I never hear back again. Alright, fair enough, you can't make someone like you if they don't. But after a particularly rough few months of getting hinge ghosted, I decided to see who I was competing with.

Scouting Report: gentlemen, we're fucked

No, really. I won't butter it up. We all know these dating apps' algorithms promote the ""most desirable"" profiles to the top of the stack. I waded through a sea of greek gods with chiseled jaw lines, summer cabins, boats, the perfect hairline and on god every one of them had the cutest puppy. Look, I can admit when a guy is good-looking. These guys were fucking 10's. And not one of them was under 6'0. I don't have data to back this up, but there is now doubt in my mind the ratio of good/average looking profiles is way higher for men, than it is for women. 

My insecurity has increased by 110%, if only I could buys puts on my self-confidence. There was not a single ""ugly"" dude. I seriously only found 2 average dudes in an hour of searching. The guy she tells you not to worry about is literally fucking Apollo.

Moral of the story: Bros; the average-looking dude in real life is not average-looking on online dating apps. The average-looking dude on online dating apps is Chris Hemsworth.

Where do us regular folk go from here? Hopefully this brings some sort of closure, i guess, to those of us who've been struggling with online dating. It might be better for your mental health to know that, yes, you never really stood a chance, but also that this situation doesn't reflect reality. I know for a fact the average guy in real life doesn't look anything like these profiles. I'll sum up the online dating situation for you; a giant ocean of very handsome men with puppies vying for the attention of a much smaller pool of attractive women. 

I could tell you how to make your profile more like the ones I saw. Take a good selfie. Work out and develop a six-pack. Put pictures of yourself doing fun activities, especially if they involve your boat. Get a dog and throw him on your profile ASAP. Get that weird jawline improving chewing toy thingy. Go to Turkey and get leg-extension surgery for $5000 USD. No, wait I'm just reading off my to-do list now. 

My actual advice? Quit online dating. Get your ass out there in real life, and meet real people. Learn how to paint, or skate, or bake. Idk, anything where you can meet someone new. Take salsa dancing classes. 

Moral of the story: you're getting ghosted on tinder/hinge/etc because your competing against the entire ensemble of Mt. Olympus, but the good news is that's not the real world. Also, it was remarkably easy to make a fake and convincing Hinge profile, and I can't have been the first to do this, so actually unless your match is verified or has a legit social media page, she might actually be dude.

- Confirm on the day that you are still down
- Track location to prove that you don't flake. As long as you show up you get your money back
- give people a set-date and flake rating (set-date rating shows how likely you are to set a date after matching, flake rating shows how likely you are to actually go on the date)
 - reward people with high ratings (get shown to more people, can swipe more, ect), maybe let people see your rating

We had an awesome day: Boba, thrifting, talking in the park, mini golf, sitting in the car and listening to music... just an awesome day.

Over the next 2 weeks we have talked more and more over text, being REALLY emotionally vulnerable with each other about life.

Just this Sunday, we hung out again. We watched a movie over at my house, then we got food and hung out at a park after dark, talking on the swinging while listening to music, then going to the peak of a large hill to just look at the town's lights from up high. Again, perfect.

Over this period of time, I have started to develop a strong connection to her, feeling romantically connected. Here's the one problem: in our conversations where we get really personal, she has brought up that given her current circumstances spiritually and just in general, she wants to meet her soulmate, but doesn't know ""if she knows him just yet"". 

The thing that gets me is how date-y things have felt up to this point. I really value the friendship we have built, but I can't help feeling like something more is there. At the same time, I wanna respect her and her journey right now, and if she has basically overtly stated that she doesn't like me, then it would be wrong of me to try and continue pursuing her, right?

I haven't felt this way about a person ever before, and she has even said that if she were to date right now, it would be best to have a long talking period (something I fully agree with and want myself). I just don't want to get hurt, and I especially don't want to hurt her by making it seem like all of this was for nothing and I only hang out with her because I feel this way about her. I love our friendship, I just can't help but feel like there is more to how I feel, nd the atmosphere we've created. Any advice would be amazingly appreciated. Thank you for listening to my ramblings.

I'm looking for advice and perspective. I just met a girl from bumble, and we were talking and having sex for a month but then she randomly decided to dip. I know what I did wrong and what to do better next time and tbh she probably just sucks and isnt meant for me. but anyway, I'm trying to rebound and I just don't know what the hell to do. I don't know if it's just me, but did all the dating apps suddenly become freaking terrible?  How do people meet girls IRL?

Like, tinder in college I would get a million matches (I consider myself pretty good looking). Even like 2 years ago tinder was amazing and would give you so many matches in LA. And hinge was killing it for a while last year + 2019 too, i was getting sooo many matches. But I went on it recently, even paid for a month of it, and all they do for the most part is show me hundreds and hundreds of profiles of unattractive women, and then the one attractive one burried in the rough I'm not matching with. it did NOT used to be like this. Did they change their business model to give men less matches to make more money? Could it be possible that I exhausted all women near me in LA? There's no way. or that the male to female ratio on these is just that terrible? Even after freaking paying for it i'm not getting a fraction of the matches I was getting a year or two ago, and if anything my profile is better. Maybe I need a reset?

But off the topic of dating apps, I would rather meet a girl in person if I can. I'm just in this shitty situation where all of the friends I have i'm not super close too. I'll hang with friends here and there but they're all separate social circles, and not in one cohesive friend group. And I love my friends, but even some of the closest ones I have don't seem to be my exact type of friend, who likes all the things I like (being social, drinking, going to parties/bars, playing/watching sports, hanging out with girls and guys.. I'm trying to find a way to enter a social circle somehow but I don't know where to look. All i've thought of is going to a new gym or playing basketball more often, or joining some club/volunteer/group (I dont even know what to join). Especially after this girl left me i've been lonely as hell, I'm not getting sex nor feel like I have close friends that still live in my city which I completely vibe with. Are there better ways to meet people online than the dating apps? Are there other online communities or ways of meeting people in your area that are actually good? I think i'm attractive and pretty driven, generally a cool and chill person so this shouldn't be as hard as it feels right now. From reading this you'd probably think i'm a loner or social weirdo but i'm not. I'm a social chill dude that somehow ended up in this shitty situation. Maybe LA just sucks. maybe I just need one opportunity or to meet one person and it'll change my life. but i'm just bored as hell right now and i'm working remotely so that doesn't help this cause of meeting people either.

I used to think things were great at the beginning of our relationship and only soured over time. Looking back with some hard earned maturity and perspective I realize things weren’t as rosy as I thought at the time. I was only 21 when I met him and he was 29. 

Maybe that should have been a red flag that a guy almost thirty was into me. But in my defense I was always the awkward girl with braces and acne in high school. I was a late bloomer who guys started to notice when I was about 20 so I wasn’t the most experienced girl when I met him.

Well we dated for almost three years. The last six months or so were just the worst. As  I started to mature I realized how much time I had wasted with him. I was just working up the courage to say fuck this, I’m out of this relationship. It was hard for me to do because he spent a lot of our relationship convincing me how lucky I was to have him, that he had lowered his standards by dating me and that I’d have a hard time finding anyone else. I actually *believed* him. 

Well I ended up getting pregnant. I found out I was pregnant in April. When he found out he immediately demanded to know what my plans were. He didn’t want kids he told me. How did I let this happen? It was all my fault. I honestly didn’t know what I was going to do at the time. But I decided I was keeping the baby. He told me that if I didn’t have an abortion he was going to break up with me so I called his bluff and told him to fuck off. He reminded me that I’d be in my own and he didn’t want anything to do with the baby. Man child. A fucking 33 year old man child. So yeah I made sure he knew I was fine with my baby not having him as it’s male role model since he wasn’t a real man anyway.

I knew being a single mom wouldn’t be easy but I also knew my parents and brothers and friends would support me. So my baby would have plenty of love from family and friends and a mom who would love him or her unconditionally. So yeah I went for the first time to hear my baby’s heartbeat with my mom and my oldest brother’s wife. My ex had no interest. 

Then in July I had a miscarriage. I don’t know why. It was a seemingly healthy pregnancy and one day I woke up in terrible pain and I had a miscarriage. My sister in law took me to the hospital and my mom and dad came and waited for me. And my family took me home and sat with me and were there for me as I cried over my baby. That was four months ago and I don’t even know if my ex knew I miscarried or not.

So he suddenly out of nowhere called me yesterday. From a number I didn’t recognize. I was waiting for a call about something from work so I thought it might be that. But it was him.

He proceeded to tell me all about what he’s been up to these past six months and how much he misses me. Yeah I really want to hear all about your new job and your new car and how you had a sweet trip to Las Vegas with your boys. I was quiet the whole time. Then I told him I was glad he had such a great summer. I lost my baby over the summer. 

Then he said oh yeah I heard something about that. I’m real sorry. I mean maybe it wasn’t meant to be. I asked him why the fuck he called me. He said he heard that I was dating someone now and was it true. I said yeah I am and it’s none of your business. 

He said I didn’t have to be so rude about it. He had been thinking about me a lot and realized he messed up really badly and wonders if I’d like to meet up for coffee or something. The balls on this guy. I asked what made him think I ever wanted to even be in the same room as him for the rest of my life. I really just laid into him. God how could I have ever been so naive to think he was worth my time? I told him never to call me again then I blocked the number he called from.

i personally thought it felt inconclusive. she said she has thought about us that way &amp; knows she deserves something/someone good &amp; doesnt wanna miss out, but they also dont wanna make mistakenly make me their ginuea pig &amp; hurt me. then a day later she called me &amp; kept apologizing &amp; saying how much she appreciates &amp; cares for me &amp; that if i do take time for myself she hopes i come back bc she wants me in her life.

My best friends were always the ones jumping from boyfriend to boyfriend with people constantly fawning over them. I, on the other hand, was a late bloomer and looked like an tall, lanky 9 year old until I was 15. I have a pretty unique fashion sense and some odd/nerdy interests. That plus a-cups and a big nose makes me pretty much the polar opposite of what boys my age want.

Most of them make that extremely clear, in fact I’ve been called more names than I can count. Squidward, witch without the wart, minecraft villager, airplane lander forehead. My favorite was “You’re so skinny that if your eye bags were any bigger you’d look like a meth addict”. It used to really beat me down, I felt like complete shit about myself and hated everything about me. Over time, however, I learned to like what was different about me even if no one else did. I learned how to do makeup, how to dress myself fashionably, how to make friends. Other girls started to respect and befriend me. Even though guys still generally want nothing to do with me, I still felt much better.

But recently I’ve been getting to know a guy (17m) who seems....different? He actually makes an effort to talk to ME. Not only do I not have to constantly fight just to get a basic human acknowledgement, he actually seems to enjoy being around me! He actually LIKES when I tell him about the things I’m into as well as talk about his interests. He actually asks me to hang out with him! He’s sweet, intelligent, has a great sense of humor, and I feel like I could talk to him for hours. Not to mention how physically attractive he is. It honestly kind of blows my mind that he might be interested IN ME! Normally whenever I meet someone I like I constantly have to remind myself that it will only end in rejection and that I’m getting my hopes up for nothing, but I think I actually have a shot at it this time!

I Know this is long but bare with me. I met this wonderful girl at the gym 6 weeks ago and got her number. We’re both first year uni but I’m a couple years older due to taking a few years off. 

Long story short, we started off really slow. Coffee first week/date, brunch second week/date, dinner third week/date, then an entire week where we spent 4 nights together just hanging out. Everything was going great and we both got emotionally attached very quickly. I went into uni not wanting a relationship, but this girl has made me definitely want one with her, she checks all the boxes. For this reason I didn’t prioritize sex, I wanted to make sure she was 10000% comfortable and safe before we did anything… 

Here is where it gets confusing… We hung out Friday night two weeks ago and it was great. Saw her the next morning in the library and told her we should hang out later, she said she’d love to. I snapped her a funny pic mid afternoon but never got a response. Took her 24 hours to reply. I left her on opened and texted her that night asking how her day was, never got a response. Then called her Monday evening to see if everything was ok, was really thrown off at this point. She didn’t pick up, but called me back right away and we talked for 20 mins. Told her we should grab some food and hang at mine, but she told me that she might not be able to that week because of exams. I understood and told her to study hard. 

I reached out a couple days later asking how the studying was going, took her 5 hours to respond saying she was so so sorry for not getting back to me because its been a crazy day. She then spam called me4 times and she told me she wanted to call to talk and tell me that she wasn’t ignoring me. We chatted for an hour and the conversation flowed well. 

She texted me a few days later asking how I was doing, we talked and I told her I’d love to see her at some point. She again said she wasn’t feeling herself and that she’s been having some family issue so hasn’t been wanting to leave her house. Told her I was really sorry to hear it and that she should take the time she needs to feel better. She’s been depressed and her mother is sending her to a therapist and doctor to get things under control. 

Few days later (last Saturday) she FaceTimes me and we talk for a couple hours. Even after not seeing her for a couple weeks, the conversations flows so well and we have great chemistry. She promised we’d hang out soon.

Since the FaceTime I haven’t reached out, I am simply not sure what is going on. I truly believe that she is going through some tough times mentally, I’m just not sure if if I should keep asking to see her or if I should even keep checkin in. I can’t keep asking her to hang out and have her tell me she’s not feeling up to it, or that she has school. 

If she wasn’t interested, she would cut ties and not call, FaceTime, and text me…

I didn't respond to it at all and leaned away to try to give a hint without being aggressive about it cause we were alone and men are uh...unpredictable...let's put it at that. We kept talking and then he put his arm like along the back of the bench which guys sit like all the time so I wasn't really paying much mind until he started to drum his fingers like along my back and I just immediately went into fuck this mode.

I assume things are going well we spend the halloween weekend together and he seems to enjoy my company. Last weekend i spent the night with him like i had the weekend prior.

The rest of the day i spend at the mall with friends.

 He gets off work at 8 and so i don't text him until around that time. I notice when i texted him he was being short with me. It was unusual so i asked him why. He told me that someone had gotten into his room and broken into his closet. Im trying to be consoling but its to no avail bc he suspects me. He tells me he isn't very trusting right now and needs to take a step back. I understand him being upset but i don't understand why he thinks i would break into his room. Im trying to tell him that i couldn't even get access to his room without a key (he lives in a dorm) to the entrance outside. 

He tells me he has no interest in rebuttals and has nothing to say to me besides some red flags (ominous poison shirt, choice in words, strange political comments). It just seemed very odd.

We have acutally been acquainted for some time but went on a date late Oct 2020 that turned into a relationship. I had not seen her for a couple of years and she had put on a few pounds which she spoke to on the ride to our restaurant referring to it as ' Covid weight ' from working at home and not doing much else. Obviously just a subject briefly touched on and left alone given that it was our first date. I didn't want to be overly superficial since we had been flirtin and talking before the date which lead me to believe she was the one to choose over a few other girls I was hanging out with or talking to on a flirtatious level... 

Fast forward about 2 months into dating and hanging out she was wanting to know if we were going to be a serious couple and I decided we would go that direction. 

At first she was gaining more but kept insisting she was going to get on track. She started making an effort to take off weight by exercising at home and eventually starting going to the gym on her lunch. I made sure to compliment her and do what I could to boost her confidence/motivate her.  She had a bout with some mental issues and stopped going. Then she gained so much weight a couple of people thought she was pregnant when we went out in public! 

I started to feel much less attracted to her and stopped getting physical to the point where she noticed and asked about it. Not wanting to crush her emotionally I chalked it up to "" stress "" from my high stress level job.  We still don't really get intimate often and I find it hard to be romantic / physical because I am less attracted with all this gain. 

She is truly a great person and my teen daughter loves her. My whole family really likes her. I like her friends. I like her family and we have a ton of mutual friends as well. 

I work out regularly even despite long hours at a demanding job. Although I am not super ripped people do recognize me as someone who is into fitness and works out regularly. So obviously I am somewhat concerned about health and fitness. The main reason I work out is for both physcial and mental health which I feel she would benefit from as well. Part of it is cosmetic as I want my partner to be attracted to me so I feel a little taken for granted in regard to my efforts there. 

I am not going to push her to go lose weight because that is obviously extremely rude. Women have so much pressure that men don't to "" look good "" so I am not going there at all. I will love her unconditionally but sometimes love isn't enough to be with someone...but I don't want to leave either. To make things more complicated I recently moved in to the 2 unit aparment building she lives in so now we live next to each other so its practically like living together...

Met this chick a couple weeks ago. I just randomly approached her and we started chatting and I got the number.

I broke my phone shortly after but I tried to send messages via Google Voice before I got another phone. She replied to them. She always said she was very busy when I asked about her schedule or free time but always said I could study with her. I tried to a few times but it didn’t work out. One day we did end up hanging out. She laughed at all my jokes, seemed high energy even though I knew she was tired, etc. I honestly had fun. I offered to take her out to the movies that weekend (the topic of horror movies came up) and she said she would go if she didn’t have so much HW.

Since then I haven’t seen her in person. We’d text a bit, she usually replies eventually. I’ve hinted at hanging out once or twice but she hasn’t been able to but she always insists that I can study with her when she’s around. There were times when I wasn’t available either though.

Lately she’s been replying to my messages really late, like in the middle of the night, 2am type stuff. Always very polite. 

I haven’t really flirted or escalated with her yet as much as I wanted yet (which is part of why I’ve been trying to take her out). We talked about dancing and stuff and she offered to teach me essentially. I like her energy, she’s pretty bubbly which is a sharp contrast to myself. I feel kinda silly sometimes with how seriously I take things when I talk to her.

From her vibe in-person and how she always offers the studying alternative even when she’s says she’s busy, I imagine she’s interested. She was obviously tired when we were talking too so I believe her on that end. I know there’s no way for you to know but from what I explained, do you think she’s interested?

From what little I know, I can see potential compatibility and that’s why I am a bit invested but if I am wasting my time I can put it on ice too. My plan is to get her out and up the ante. The first time we were out she accidentally bumped her shoulder and so I instinctively touched her and asked if she was okay. I kinda tested the waters a bit there and held it a bit longer than necessary. She didn’t stop me or even make eye contact, she just smiled and stared into space.

Fast forward to the first date. It went well, except she seemed quite nervous! She was everything I personally thought she would be. However, she showed up and almost immediately said she felt like she was gonna get a migraine. Our date was a little bit past an hour in, and I asked her if she was feeling alright. She said no, that she should probably get going.

Anyways, got a really good hug before she left, &amp; texted her after. She told me that i'm very sweet &amp; has told me i'm very cute several times. She even texted me the next morning first after I had already told her goodnight.

She went on vacation for a week, &amp; I gave her some space! She didn't text me first for this week. I've tried following up with her, and she responded after like 12 hours later, and I left her on read. I followed up after (probably too long after) &amp; asked her out again, telling her I appreciate her company, and I haven't heard from her in about two days now.

I matched with a ""digital illustrator"" with an otherwise empty profile.  Two of her pics contained subtle rainbows that were added with deft editing skills.

My ""pots of gold"" line may have been unoriginal and unfunny, and she was better looking than me, but does that justify expressing condescension rather than adding info to her profile so guys can use better openers or simply ignoring openers she considers stupid?  I think not.  Also, this was not the first time a high-effort opener was met with pure condescension.

Backstory, I’ve been through my fair share of bad boyfriends, but my last relationship was pretty rough. I lived with my ex, who was an addict, and there were some years of gaslighting/manipulation/emotional abuse that really tore me down. I eventually left and decided to take a dating break; the pandemic hit around that time as well so I had a lot of time to sit with my thoughts, look at the parts I’ve played in things, accept that what I experienced was abuse, and then sort through some deep rooted trauma.

I casually dated for a year or so while I found solid ground again. Being on my own was great and I’m now happy, stable, and at peace. Earlier this year I decided I was ready to try for more than casual so I’ve been dating since then and it’s been fine, just the general “dating sucks” stuff, but I’ve been working on opening up and letting things develop naturally etc. And this is where the question happens.

I’ve been seeing someone for a few months. He’s a solid person and is someone I’d like as a partner and he mentioned making it official a few weeks ago. I’m ready for a commitment and to start building something with someone... but part of me is also kind of freaking out because i haven’t ever been in a healthy relationship and I’m nervous about some of the things I might not have resolved that won’t surface until I’m in a relationship again. I don’t think he’s hiding things or using me or or anything like that, I’m just noticing things like—for example—when he asked me what I honestly wanted to do and I told him and he said okay, I spent 20 minutes bracing myself for an argument about how I was inconsiderate/selfish/ruined his night/etc. I’ve never been with someone who said they were okay with something only if they were actually okay with it, if that makes sense, so my guard was up. And I know that things like this will happen for a while and I want to work through it... but I don’t want him to be blindsided when it happens... but I’m also not sure how to broach the subject with him without sounding crazy.

For those of you who’ve been in a similar situation, how did you know you were ready to take that leap of faith and trust someone to be there when those things came up? How did you navigate figuring out the baggage healthily as a couple, and how open were you with your SO about the things you might struggle with? How did you learn to let go of some of the hyper-independence you had to gain after leaving a mentally/emotionally abusive relationship?

She’s a champion at banter and we’re really hitting it off. Then she mentions that she’s thinking about wearing “man pouncing clothes” to this date.

I’m old enough to dress myself and know how to pick an outfit for a date, but I’ve never been threatened so transparently with physical action.

So Reddit, what is the counterpoint to “man pouncing clothes”? If she were a cougar, I’d look for a kevlar turtleneck to protect my jugular, but we’re not that age. Do I wear sweatpants and a snack-stained T-shirt to deflect the pounce? Do I turn into the skid and pour myself into my bespoke suit that makes bridesmaids swoon? Maybe running shoes and a track suit so I can high-tail it if I survive the initial pounce?",False,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1125210,public,self,"She may be wearing ""man pouncing clothes""",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qqkdyd/she_may_be_wearing_man_pouncing_clothes/,no_ads,0.0,dating,,,,,

Me and this guy have been seeing each other for about a month or two, not every week because of work and not living in the same area and traffic being constant hell. But it was great, he told me some personal stuff about himself and maybe he’s backing off because of that? But we saw each other again after he told me and it seemed like we were both wanting to see each other again. 

Until this past weekend. We were both out of town - I went on an outdoor trip for a week and he went to some concert venue and when I had service it seemed like we were texting consistently - given the situation. Then I got back into town and our weekend plans got cancelled because he got a cold and it feels like I’ve been iced out since. He texts which were pretty consistent and responsive and now he takes multiple hours and twice now over a day to respond. Meanwhile I can see he’s been active on other social media platforms. 

Am I actually getting ghosted or maybe he’s taking a step back? I’m texting him at the end of the week or weekend about it but I’m freaking out in my head and am actually pretty sad about it especially since we both talked about how shitty ghosters are - which that’s essentially how we met. 

TL;DR: things were going great with this guy for 2 months, reveals some personal stuff which I didn’t recoil or anything from I was there for him, and a couple weeks later I start getting shut out.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1125219,public,self,I honestly don’t know what happened,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qqkqe3/i_honestly_dont_know_what_happened/,no_ads,0.0,dating,,,,,

I don’t live on campus and am only on campus twice a week. I seem to have lost all confidence when speaking to people, especially guys I find attractive. Not to mention in the beginning of the year I switched birth control, huge side effect of gaining weight. All in all my confidence is down the drain, and I used to love talking to people and making conversation. 

My situation: There’s a guy in two of my four classes, I haven’t spoken to him. I find him super attractive but can’t bring myself to make conversation with him in fear of him totally rejecting me. I need help with easy conversation starters or something! I’ve literally only said a few words to him and nothing of substance.

We’re both 21 and juniors in college- psychology program.
