i tried again with another phone call and we ended up speaking for 7 hours! we spoke about a lot of things and it was fun so i became hopeful. then we watched a show together and spoke on the phone a day later and i just felt bored again.. the conversation was stale and awkward.

Honestly it was super out of nowhere it just feels like it was longer because we started talking in august but intestate the whole pet name stuff til November when we started seeing each other. So long story short I started seeing this girl and we started seeing each other often she would always come over and it was honestly going good I really liked it but then all of a sudden one night I was picking her up and keep in mind that she did Live across I live in a border town in Laredo Texas so I would always pick her up at the border and she lived in Nuevo Laredo basically one night she was crossing and what happened was she brought me some food and some ingredients to make hotdogs the people working on the bridge basically threw it in front of her face and she felt very humiliated during the car ride she did not wanna speak to me at all I try my best to engage in a conversation but she just wasn’t in the mood to talk anyways moving forward we finally came to my house and we were watching a movie well it felt like I was watching the movie because she was still distant and kept looking at her phone H I tried to make conversation again but she still doesn’t want to talk but anyways before heading to bed she had told me hey can you please drop me off tomorrow in the morning I don’t think I want to be here all day so we had actually planned to watch a show the following day but you know I respected her space and I wanna head and dropped her off in the morning after that she still seemed a little bum and I noticed she was being very distant I noticed after that day when I dropped her off she stopped telling me I love you as well as her pet names I wanted reassurance and I told her that I love her and then she told me that she wanted to talk about something she went ahead and told me that she felt like I wasn’t being completely honest with her and that it made her feel uncomfortable and as if I was a stranger to her I was really confused and I told her that I didn’t want her to feel like that so anyways she ended up saying that she couldn’t change her mind about how she felt about it and that she did not want to go out with me anymore after that happened I did feel sad however I didn’t want to cry but then again I didn’t because at the same time I was also working I work from home so I take calls so I don’t really have time for that but anyways that’s been already more than a week ago and today I’ve been at home all day and I still think about it I still feel sad about it and I’m not sure if I should cry I still haven’t cried over what happen and I’m not sure if I should cry I know that we were together longer this probably would’ve ended even worse and I probably would’ve hit me even harder but I’m just not sure how to deal with it I’m not sure of me holding in my tears would be best showing me that I can with stand this type of situation but I do try to keep myself distracted which is also what helps so today I’m still home alone and I sorta feel like crying but I’m not sure if that’s right for me. Moving back to the break up I did go ahead and tell her I’m really sorry about how you feel and I wish that we could go ahead and talk more about this but I can’t change the way you think about me but I do wish you the best I still see her online on my Facebook messenger and she still looks at my stories every single day I actually get notifications for the people that look at my story on Facebook and on Instagram and she still appears she does have all of my contact information so by any chance if she still wants to talk about it she can go ahead and reach out to me I’m not sure if that something I should look forward to because at the same time I don’t but I’m not sure how to go about it if that were to happen but I’m also not thinking about that.,True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1152991,public,self,Handling first break up after a while not sure how to go about it,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s5rj3m/handling_first_break_up_after_a_while_not_sure/,no_ads,0.0,

So yeah,m 24 yrs old, I'm looking for an online dating website since I am shy to ask someone out in real life. I'm so timid that several times, girls have asking me out or sent me hint like being treated specially(sharing food, paying attention to my clothes, asking to go out or teasing me/grabing my cheeks/arms/chests....) I just ghost them when they go too far, it feels weird to have feelings for someone. I'm not into dating in public..... And I'm picky.

For my higher school education, I went to a school only for boys and was there for like 8 years, barely talking to any girl outside. And my parents have been gicing me tips on ""how to choose the perfect girl."" So I guess these are the root of my problem.


That's why I'm into online dating. Tried Tinder no success, tried an online website but it was just a scam dating web, had to pay to send every messages.


Since then I don't trust online dating that much. But if a dating website requires one of the user to upgrade to a membership(15 USD a month) so that he/she may send or read messages. Is it a scam?

I know that the last time I fkd him was May of that year because I distinctly remember that morning he was moving to a new place with his best friend (29M) who was moving back to town. The 27M started dating someone more seriously around that time. Later that summer, the 29M and I were thrown together at some get togethers and that eventually led to us hooking up in late summer. We continued to see each other every weekend (at my place) for a couple of months. Our hangouts were never “dates.” He came over at the end of the day, usually after a late shift of work/after both of us had hung out with other friends. There were times that we spent the entire weekend together. We had fun, sex was good, and I felt that we were mutually kind of giddy around each other. We never discussed the fact that I had slept with his friend/now-roommate. Like I said, I know he knew, but I doubt he knew the exact timeline of things. Anyway, he eventually let things fizzle with me. I ended up calling him one night (alcohol involved but not drunk) and told him I was starting to really like him, was disappointed he lost interest and asking him what happened. He gave some vague excuses to spare my feelings and likely try to leave the door open for future fuckery. I ended up cutting off communication with him a couple weeks after that call (deleted on snapchat, deleted but didn’t block #) since he was continuing to string me along despite obviously having lost interest. As far as I know he never tried to reach out, but he did mention once in person that I blocked his SC. I told him that was because my feelings were hurt. That was almost a year ago. Since then, we’ve hung out in group settings a handful of times (friendly w each other) and I’ve run into him once or twice around town, also friendly interactions. I’ve been working away from home for several mos and am on my way back. Now that some time has passed, and I still think about him, I’m wondering if I should find a way to reconnect w him or if he’s just a master fuck boy who got under my skin.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1153008,public,self,Difficulty distinguishing sex from (hot) male friendship,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s5sbzv/difficulty_distinguishing_sex_from_hot_male/,no_ads,0.0,

At first it was nothing serious at all. Friendly, light flirting. I honestly wasn’t sure if I liked him enough in that way to be in a relationship with him so I kept it light. In the beginning he was definitely the pursuer about 90% of the time. He asked me to go on a date once and I agreed but he ended up having to cancel. We both are fairly busy, and usually talk the most in the evenings. However over Christmas break he flew home (away from me) and we ended up talking non stop and I started catching feelings. He seemed like he was as well. We’ve talked about casual things and have also gone into serious things and confided in each other. He’s said the L word more than once, and has talked about making it official more than once. (I am a little more reserved with the L word until I’m 100% sure). Here’s my dilemma. He seems serious, yet we’ve only ever gone out once. Some of that is due to covid restrictions and his job, but I feel like if he wanted too, he could. Then there will be almost entire days when he doesn’t have much to say and a couple days later be apologizing profusely for not paying me more attention. When we did go on a date, even after all these weeks of talking, getting comfortable w each other and even sexting, he didn’t try to hold my hand or kiss me goodbye. He has admitted before that he’s very shy and awkward with these things tho. I’m just a little confused at times if he’s actually into this….or just stringing me along. What do u think? Am I expecting too much from something that’s not official yet?

Got a couple flags thrown up at the start where different drug experimentation and drug use was mentioned. Also I noticed that they consumed quite a bit of alcohol while we were together. They didn't seem inebriated at all and there wasn't any problematic behavior.  Thing is, I used to live a lifestyle like this so I noticed the mass consumption and drug comments right away. 

So not the biggest deal, but the lifestyle I live doesn't really conform to the schedule of copious drug and alcohol use. I don't think that you have to be the same as your partner for it to work out. Or be on the same schedule.  I fact I find the differences fascinating and the time apart keeps things interesting.

He asked to take me out on a date. 

Before our first date he was upset with me because, I would take a while to respond to his text, I put off going on a date with him, and the one day we were supposed to go on our first date, we ended up rescheduling because of miscommunication. I never got ready because I hadn’t heard from him, but he did eventually text me later that day wanting to pick me up. But i wasn’t even ready , so I didn’t want to go. He then said because i never asked him what time we were going out he told me  “i don’t seem interested”, I told him I was and we just rescheduled the date. 

The day of our date he wanted to pick me up , but i told him I was already out and I would just meet him there. He asked me who I was with, to which I responded it was just going to be me and him, but I’m assuming he thought I was with another guy? We finally met at the movies and i was thrown off because he didn’t offer to pay for the date…he lost his card and only brought cash which they don’t accept. So I ended up paying for both of our tickets and he sent me money for his ticket. But I think he should have at least offered to pay for us both because he asked to take me out. I just left feeling like he didn’t really care to try to impress me. Even though I wouldn’t have let him pay for me (because i don’t want men to think I’m using them) It’s just boils down to principal, if you ask someone out you should at least offer to pay for the date. But i do think because he thought I was with someone else he didn’t pay for the date.

A week and a half later he asked me out to brunch on New Years, but I ended up not going but told him if he wanted to do something later we could. 

He called me hours later, I didn’t answer.  so he texted me asking if I wanted to come to a party I asked which one and he just replied what city he was in and not exactly the details for the party. I was already out with my friends partying so I didn’t I respond until late like 3AM. He never texted me back. 

We hang around the same people so 2 weeks later, we’re in the same section in the club and I walk in to see him with another girl dancing on him, and I think he even brought her flowers in the club. We didn’t speak and I was so hurt and upset because I really did like him, it was to the point I couldn’t sleep well that night, and my stomach felt tight all night. 

Instantly my reaction was f*** him, but do I have the right to feel that way, or was I wrong? It is very rare for me to like/be attracted to someone and he’s the only person I’ve come across where I feel like something could come out of it.

The problem is she’s got a bf. I know how it sounds but in reality I’ve come out of a long term relationship since we mutually knew we didn’t want to spend the rest of our life together. She met her bf in lockdown and since we’re so similar it’s not hard to gauge the situation. I don’t think I could’ve been that ‘selfish’ and break up with a long term partner for her even if I knew I had found somthing that could be more permanent. And I don’t think she will. Even though we feel like we’ve been looking for each other our whole lives.

We only have a definite 5 more months knowing each other before we finish the job we’re working on together and possibly go our separate ways. The problem is I know she’ll be sad and I know she really sees a future between us she’s just too nice to be selfish and think about herself. 

Overall looking for advice, I Always respect her boundary’s and the first time she told me she had a bf I said it’s cool and took it on the chin and long story short she made it known she likes me too. It’s not a great situation to be in and I’ve tried just being open and talking about it but I’m sure she doesn’t really want to and I don’t want to force her to talk about it. 

How do we go from living in blind naivety to happiness? Or perhaps I should simply walk away but I’ve got to admit, I’d be surprised if I ever meet someone else and Feel so instantly intellectually compatible with them.

Then I met my ex husband when I was 20. I fell in love with his broken pieces and he fell in love with mine.

He was also my first boyfriend.

Now, on the brink of 35 I have so very randomly met someone amazing. He is perfection. He is kind, he's funny, close with his family, keeps a busy active schedule, literally has never been in a fight. Unless he was playing hockey lol. He says the most wonderful things to me. He brings a kind of calmness in my soul that I have never ever experienced. It's freaking weird. And scares the whole crap out of me.

He leaves for Mexico Mexico 3 months in 3 weeks. I just can't believe I randomly met him. There was something there from the first conversation. He talks to me everyday. He asks how I am. Tells me I'm beautiful. 

However it's only been 2 1/2 weeks and speed that he's going is super overwhelming. He says he doesn't find the need to play games, he's blunt and just says the things he says to me because he feels them and believes them.

I had a momentary state of panic and told him I couldn't see him anymore. He basically was like why are you freaking out. That we don't know what's going to happen and that he wants to try with me thar he likes me and thinks we will both regret it if we don't try. That my past doesn't need to take more away from me.

So, I have this ex gf right? It was like 5 years ago we moved in together. We ended up living together for around 2 years. Then our relationship started to go south. At the time I was (M24) and she (F22) and we just really weren't at a point in our lives where we knew what we wanted. Well, I take that back, she was still in college and is finishing a PHD as far as I know. 

Really, I just didn't know what I wanted and I really was just a bad boyfriend. Eventually she broke up with me and I did not handle it well. I got like super needy and begged her and all the stuff an insecure guy does when they get dumped. I know, I know I can feel the shame of past me still to this day lol. 

Since then, I have had some pretty dramatic life events take place that were really challenging for me and I'm really a different person now. Like, I am not just saying that to say that ""I've changed"" but I legitimately have. I have been thinking about her again lately and I kinda want to reach out and say hi. 

But, I legitimately don't know what to say. We haven't spoken in over a year, I have no idea who she is anymore and I really don't even remember her that well because it has been some years since we were even friendly. The things I do remember are that she's just the type of woman I respect and would love to have in my life again.

Again, I don't know if I should or not. You know? Like I was really pathetic for a long time when we broke up and I feel like messaging her is just going to piss her off and get a giant eye roll. If I were to message her, what do you even say without coming off as a total weirdo? 

On another note, I have been single now for 7 months (which I desperately needed I now realize) so it's not like I'm looking for a rebound or anything. I can't really even tell you why I have been thinking about her again. It's not like I think we could just fall back into a relationship or anything. Idk, I just don't know what to do. What do you guys think?  

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I have been thinking about an ex lately. It has been a long time since we broke up. I don't know what to say, but I feel like I want to say something? Don't know what to do.

We have a lot in common and had similar goals for the future and what we want in a relationship. However, he got out of a pretty bad relationship a couple of months ago that lasted 4 months. He basically felt that the relationship was one sided and he’d put a lot of time, money, and emotional energy into it only for the girl to end things and go back to her ex. Because of this, he told me he wanted to “take it slow and see where things go naturally.”

We went on one date and then after that, most of our time together has comprised of me going to his apartment, spending a couple of hours with him, and then we sleep together. We went on another date the other night and have plans to go shopping next week and have our first sleepover. The vibes are always there and he does text me everyday but I feel a little paranoid about how noncommittal he seems. 

I asked him yesterday if he would be upset about me going out on a date to gauge his reaction and he said that it would make him feel a little upset, but that ultimately we aren’t dating so I could do what I want. That response was definitely not what I wanted to hear. He then told me he likes me and isn’t talking to anyone else, but I still see him getting notifications from Bumble on his phone.

my bf (18m) and i (17m) have had an okay relationship so far. we've been together for 6 months now, and we treat each other with kindness and respect. any issues we've had we've been able to work through in therapy together and through communication. however, right now, i'm contemplating breaking up with him because i don't feel like he's standing by me and i feel disrespected.

he has a girl best friend, let's call her rose (17f) who he's recently gotten closer with. if they were this close when him and i got together, i wouldn't have gotten into a relationship with him. a girl best friend is a deal breaker for me. my ex cheated on me with his, and i broke up with him because of it. i understand that my current bf is not my ex, but because of what's happened in the past, i don't trust girl best friends, and so it's a boundary i've set. i know that that might not seem fair to some people, but to each their own - this is my dealbreaker. so anyways, rose and her friends have a history of excluding me. they threw a halloween party, invited my bf and not me, and one of the girls there kissed him on the cheek. she was drunk (not that it's an excuse but i'm giving context) and he didn't know she was going to, and he left the room and told me as soon as it happened. however, to my knowledge, he didn't say anything to her about it, and he stayed at the party and continued to party with everyone there. this was back in october. i've since been excluded from a number of other events, all of which i've heard from my friends there that my name was explicitly mentioned, as in ""no let's not invite (my name)"". it sucks. even when my bf and i have bumped into these girls out and about, most recently at a concert, they've run up to him and hugged him and barely gave me a second glance. it was disrespectful. one of the girls even went as far as to hug me and say ""hi nice to meet you"", despite the fact that she's said the same thing to me twice in the past 2 months. 

anyways, moving onto rose, i recently reached out to her via text and discussed the situation with her. my bf wanted me and her to be friends, and so encouraged me to talk to her about this. i told her i was hearing that these girls were intentionally leaving me out (she's one of the girls excluding me, by the way, i just didn't want to directly say ""i heard you did this"" because she'd get defensive and it would be an unproductive conversation). anyways, she told me she hadn't heard anything, and that she wants to be friends with me, so we agreed too make plans. this was about 2 weeks ago. i've since tried to make plans with her 4 times, none of which have worked. the last time, i was at my bf's house, and i invited her to go for a walk with us, since my bf and rose are neighbours, but she told me she couldn't come because her mom wouldn't let her go out, saying she had to study for an exam she had that week. however, after i left my bf's house that night, him and his friend (19m) (also their neighbor) went for a walk, they called her to come out and she did. she stayed with them for about 20 mins. her excuse was that she was walking her dog, and asked my bf to tell me that she was sorry she couldn't come out with me, and only went out after i left. however, i was hurt by this because a) it seemed like that was only an excuse, and b) she didn't text me to apologize herself, which i felt she should've done if she really did feel bad. this all leads me to the current situation. 

she's throwing a birthday party this weekend, and she's invited my bf, but i'm not invited. she invited about 20 people, and so when i told my bf i was upset i wasn't invited, especially since i had spoken to her about how i was already feeling upset about being excluded, he texted her asking to bring me. she said it was okay as long as she was still having 20 people over, because due to covid, she might have to downsize. since then, she's told him she's going to do a smaller party, meaning that i'm no longer invited. this makes me feel even more upset because just last month by boyfriend invited her boyfriend to his party, even though he only invited 7 people, and even though he wasn't friends with rose's boyfriend, just out of respect for her boyfriend and their relationship. i explained all of this to my boyfriend last night, as well as other concerns i had with rose's behaviour, and he told me he'd speak to her today. to my knowledge he hasn't spoken to her yet, but he's still going to her birthday party. he still also wants to go on a double date with her and her boyfriend, which i'm not so keen on. i told him that the only way i'll even consider being friends with rose again is if she apologizes to me, which i can't really see her doing. so right now, it feels like it's me vs. my boyfriend and rose. i don't think he's taking a stand with me, which is especially upsetting since i've been there for him through so much, and have had to make him feel better about some things that rose had done to him in the past. i've asked him to take a step back from his friendship with rose, explaining how a girl best friend is a dealbreaker with me, and he seemed pretty reluctant about it.

My current place is small, and I'm looking to upgrade. So, I went online and requested a tour of a few places that fit my needs. Then I went to bed. (I promise that most of that is important.) Around half an hour later, as I was drifting off to Dreamland (7:30 pm, so not an unreasonable time to call), I got a call from a woman about one of the properties I requested more information about. Because my sleep was interrupted, I was less than kind (some would argue straight-up rude) to this unfortunate woman just doing her job. She apologized and said she would call the next day at an earlier time. 

The next morning, my mind was clearer, and I realized how much of an ass I had been and determined that she deserved an apology for my behavior. I was wrong, and I knew it. When she called, I apologized, and we went on to business. It turns out the current tenant is still in the process of moving, and she wasn't ready to show the place. I said that was fine and that my timeline isn't too short. I still have a couple of months after all. Our conversation was pretty relaxed; all things considered, and I was tempted to try flirting with her. Right brain stepped in before I made an ass of myself (again) and reminded... uh... me that she was trying to get a tenant. She has to be nice to me. Her livelihood depends on it. So, I kept our conversation business. She told me she'd call me when her current tenant leaves and the place becomes available. 

My question is this: Once our business has concluded, whether or not I move into one of her renthouses, would it be ok if I asked her out, or is that wrong?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1153097,public,self,Is it wrong to flirt with a realtor while they're trying to help you find a new place to live?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s5x57m/is_it_wrong_to_flirt_with_a_realtor_while_theyre/,no_ads,0.0,

Truth is, I am a virgin because of me. its not the fault of women or even other men. I have low self esteem and not much of a personality.

However whenever I try to improve myself in every aspect of my life and self I always get discouraged and give up for several reasons.

One of them is that I always see and hear about guys who have so much less going for them and are able to attract beautiful women and find casual sex so easily.

I am not saying I have to become a billionaire or something but should I even bother to make something of myself when there are so many guys with so much less (looks, money, success, etc) that are able to sleep around easily?

I can't help but feel irked that I have to develop a sense of humor, confidence, etc for my inner attractiveness and for other aspects of myself when I see and hear about fat guys, guys on the sex offender registery, serial killers, poor guys, in some cases even homeless guys who succeed with women and dating.

I do not know why but I would rather have sexual relationships with beautiful women when I am in a lesser position in life (if that makes sense).

Long story short he sent me outside alone at midnight to scrape the ice off my car for who knows how long in the freezing cold while it was raining/snowing, whatever, after he expressed ""concern"" about me driving in the snow. Unless I'm driving to his place of course. I deserve better than this and I'm done.

Now I know it's not his car not his responsibility but, it's the principle. Never send a girl out at midnight by herself whole this some stranger in a white truck circling the neighborhood.

She invited me to her place this Saturday (15th) and we had sex. However, since then, she only texted me once or twice, which is a lot less than the frequency of texts before. 

Ofc I understand people get busy, but I feel anxious as if either she just wanted sex, or the sex wasn’t great, or she’s just less interested now. Note: the sex seemed good, she said “i’m gonna cum”, her leg was shaking, and we pillow talked for 30 mins or so after.

But he has not asked me out yet. He just said once “hopefully we get to meet at some point”. He asks everyday how my day is and always ask about my plans in the weekend. Tomorrow (Monday) is a holiday and he texted me yesterday “How’s your weekend going? You have tomorrow off as well right?”

Two days ago when we called, he asked about my plans for holiday and I said I’m not sure. When I asked him back, he said he is going out with his friends. Then he said “so just gonna be at home resting right?” 

He sends me photos of his cat and links of his favorite restaurant too. Since he asks my day and my plans, I feel that he is interested, but not sure if he is just being polite and doing that to just make me keep liking him. 

What do you think is the reason? 

He said he has been to dates, but was not been on a relationship. And he knows I like him too, I expressed it. 

I just don’t know what he’s thinking and what his true intentions are. Does he truly like and care about me? Does he have something else in mind and just acting? Does he only want to sleep with me? 

And in the call, he also asked my future plans like if I will ever want to go to grad school. And I said yes, then he asked implying if it would be in the same city/state.
