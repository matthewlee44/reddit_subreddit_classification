42,n4vrkt,1620156233,How do I know if feeling a disconnect is due to incompatibility or just my own issues/insecurities that I need to work on? Do I call things off if I still feel so much anxiety after 6 months?,"Hi.  I (28F) have been seeing a guy (42M) since November. Things at first felt way too casual and hookup-y for me and in February I brought it up, after which point we discussed it and both of us were on the same page re: wanting a relationship and he started making a lot more effort. 

I started to really develop feelings for him and a lot of our values and goals line up. I'm just feeling so confused still about ""us"" and wondering if this confusion is a sign we are incompatible. We are six months in and I still feel like I don't know where I stand. We still have never had an explicit chat about exclusivity, which freaks me out. It feels like it's just assumed by both of us at this point. When he texts me it often veers sexual (if we're talking about our day he will always start sexting me at some point in the convo). I've mentioned it to him and he says he's just a very sexual person, but it it again brings me back to feeling like he doesn't take me seriously. I met one of his friends and he's met my roommate, that's it.

 I feel like things could go either way. I'm so happy and comfortable with him and can see a future and we're clicking soo much one day. And then the next time we see each other it's just so *off* I can't even describe it. Our conversation is so offbeat and not flowing, I feel uncomfortable and worry he's lost interest in me completely. I don't feel like myself. I sometimes even think I'm about to get ghosted by this guy when 12 hours go by and I don't hear back. Then there is another really great date and I feel happy again - the cycle continues. 

Helpful context: I am a pretty insecure person and have always struggled with feeling not worthy of love and being uninteresting. I am very introverted and find it  hard to connect with people in general. I have tried therapy and intend to try it again with a different therapist. I'm worried I am sabotaging a potentially great relationship due to my anxiety and insecurity. But then again a healthy relationship wouldn't be causing me so much stress and overthinking.

What are your thoughts? Does everyone struggle with this to some degree, or does this seem so severe I should just be focusing on myself and my own mental health?  I realize I need to be more communicative with him and not the internet but it helps to just type things out.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/n4vrkt/how_do_i_know_if_feeling_a_disconnect_is_due_to/
