1,nzlel7,1623672806,How do you filter hard and fight FOMO?,"I hope this doesn't come off as a weird humblebrag because I can assure you it's not meant to be. I realize many people complain that they don't get matches on dating apps.

In my case, I seem to do alright and get a fair few matches. I'm probably a 7 out of 10 looks wise, maybe that bumps up to an 8 with personality. But obviously I can't be the judge of that. Anyway, as a result am a bit overwhelmed with who I should meet up with.

I struggle with filtering my matches because I've got a FOMO that I may dismiss someone who could actually be the right person for me. But I can't possibly go on dates with every woman I match with. I'm a mid-30s man, I'm sure women have this much 'worse' and seeing even a tiny example of this gives me greater empathy for why some matches don't go anywhere. 

Currently about 40 people have liked my profile on Hinge, for example, but I refuse to pay for a pro version so if I want to match with say the 10th person to like me, I have to filter through the other 30. 

How do you filter your matches so that you conserve your energy and time and don't get burnt out, but still give people a chance? 

When I first got on apps years ago I had a very low bar for meeting up, so I ended up on up to five or six dates a week which was completely unsustainable. It's all a numbers game, so I had more overall success back then (eg, more sex, more second, third, fourth etc dates) simply because I met more people. It wasn't great I admit, but I used to think ""well, she looks cute, I'll go on a few dates and worst case we hook up even if it goes nowhere romantically."" Now days I go on less dates, but I'm aiming for quality over quantity and I want a long term relationship not casual sex. 

TL;DR: How do you find a balance between filtering so you are putting effort/energy into the right people but not too much filtering where you become too picky and possibly miss out on a great relationship because you didn't give someone a chance?",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/nzlel7/how_do_you_filter_hard_and_fight_fomo/

Is that what dating is? Changing yourself completely so someone feels needed and kissing their behind. If that’s the case, then I probably shouldn’t date. But I figured I’d ask others. 
I’ve also been told since I don’t want to be married, I’ll never find anyone because everyone (esp in the South) wants marriage. Marriage to me seems like a suffocating and painful death. Kudos to the people that have done it and stick with it but it’s a no from me.

8,nzoe3l,1623681855,Should I tell my new friend I am not interested in him even though he has not said anything to me?,"I (28f) have a new friend (31m) that I met through a mutual friend (his best friend)- lets call him Nick. I met Nick when I got invited to a beach trip from his best friend. It was a group of girls and guys. I really enjoyed this group and got along well. My new friend Nick started to invite me out more and its often in group settings. The only time we are alone is when we are in the car bc he'd offer me a ride. I really hate driving and I have a 2 seater car so I get picked up from friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I started to think like why does Nick include me in stuff? Does he like me? We have talked about our past relationships and dating. I even said I am not looking to date and he asked what I am looking for and I said friendship.

&amp;#x200B;

So the point of this post: Saturday night Nick picked me up with another friend and we met with a group of people at an after wedding party. I wanted to mingle. Most of his friends left and I wanted to stay bc I wanted to talk to this guy. There was another couple with us and the girlfriend was helping me mingle. I took her to the bathroom to tell her about my concern with Nick and she didnt think he likes me bc he could see us attempting to mingle and prob would have left by now.

&amp;#x200B;

When we got back from the bathroom, her boyfriend told her that Nick has a crush on me. She told me not to say anything and that she had to leave. So now I was alone with Nick and the guy I wanted to mingle with. I am sitting at the bar, Nick is to my right and the guy was to my left. I felt so fucking awkward that I was being weird and short with the guy I wanted to talk to. I know I am not responsible for Nick's feeling but I have trouble not giving a fuck. I messaged the guy the next day saying sorry if I was being short and my friend wanted to leave and that I would like to talk more. No response. I was giving mixed signals so it makes sense why he reply.

&amp;#x200B;

My question: do I tell Nick I felt really awkward on Saturday and I only think of him as a friend?

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Update: I told him I felt awkward and wanted him to know I only think of us as friends. He said he genuinely does like me and knows where I stand. He apologized if he made me feel uncomfortable. I told him thanks for having this conversation bc this is not easy.

22,nzr2oa,1623689080,"Good first date, bad teeth, love bombing?","So I (F30) matched with this guy (M36) on Tinder a month ago. After some back and forth messaging he already suggested meeting up on day 2, reasoning that based on his experiences it's better to see in person if we match. I agreed but due to me falling sick, we couldn't meet for a month. We texted pretty much every day for that month (not instant messaging but longer convo exchanges once or twice per day).

**THE GOOD:** He's nice, considerate, eloquent, reliable/consistent with communication. He's a self-proclaimed romantic. He told me he longs for a serious relationship and kids (which I also want). He had previously been in a 3-year long relationship. We have some similar interests, mostly we both like to be active outside in the nature.

**OUR DATE:** On Friday afternoon we finally met, we went for a hike. He looked a bit different than I imagined, but not in a bad way (younger / more boyish, thinner - and I guess I was sort of attracted to the idea of him appearing slightly older). We had a fun hike with relaxed conversation and some laughs. The date ended with a hug.

**THE TEETH:** The only thing that put me off are his teeth ... Not just that they're crooked (which I wouldn't really care about), but brown(ish) and he's even missing a tooth! I don't know if that's something temporary (due to sports or something) or a permanent situation, but I don't know if it's something I can get over with (I tried not to stare at his mouth so I didn't ""analyze"" how bad it really is). He mentioned considering getting braces in reference to mine, so I guess he does somewhat care about his teeth, but I don't know how to handle this ... It's really unattractive. (And no, we don't live in the USA, so healthy teeth are not a luxury.) I mean, can I somehow ask him about it, at least about the missing tooth??

I left the date thinking I'd accept a second date if he invited me, but wouldn't be sad if he didn't (probably perfect mental state after a first date?). He messaged me right after, checking if I arrived safely, and thanked for my company, complimented me. I have already agreed on meeting up again.

**LOVE BOMBING?** The other problem besides his teeth is that he seems way too smitten with me already.Here's some things he's told me before we even met: I like you, I enjoy talking to you, you're actually the only one I chat with now. I can't wait until we meet. One time we can go to X, if you'd like. Etc.

After the date his messages included him saying that I'm kind and beautiful, that I have gorgeous eyes and he felt drawn to them, that he likes me a lot and that he can't wait until we meet again. He wrote that he even wanted to kiss me at the end of the date, and I replied that I move slowly when it comes to that and that first I need to get to know the person. Now that I gave him my number, he's also started sending me random photos from the places he visits (nature) and things like that. If I say the place looks cool, he says ""we can go sometime if you want"". He wants to meet again ""ASAP"". And today he sent me a good morning message ... Yikes, this is too much for someone you have only met once, right??

What can I do about it? Is this necessarily (manipulative) love bombing or could it be just someone who got overly excited about me? How to slow him down (if this is not too big of a red flag) without hurting him? As someone who is usually anxiously preoccupied in romantic relationships, I'm trying to be emphatic and not ignore his messages (which *are* nice), but I also don't want to encourage him to text me so much and lead him on (I think that being in constant communication gives you some fake sense of connection/relationship before it's even really there). Because honestly, even if I'm not that into him, this way I'll also get used to the constant messaging and I don't want to be that attached to texting again. And maybe on the date number 2 I'll decide I definitely don't want to see him again.

**TL/DR: Chatted with a guy for a month before finally meeting. Good first date, except that he has really bad teeth, which I'm not sure if it's something I can overlook. I have already agreed on meeting up again. Since our meeting he's coming off strong/intense, complimenting me and texting a lot. I'm not sure how I should handle this?**",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/nzr2oa/good_first_date_bad_teeth_love_bombing/

26,nzt3bb,1623694420,How to bring up not having a degree?,"I (34f) never went to college - I was a great student all throughout high school (took AP &amp; IB classes, scored well on SATs), I had a 75% scholarship, but my relationship with my parents was volatile and abusive - in the middle of finals in my sophomore year, I had a violent confrontation with my mom where she physically attacked me and I left - I was between a rock and a hard place, and I had to drop out. I had to get job, I had to work, I had to find a place and I had to prioritize a roof over my head and food in my stomach.

Regardless of that hardship, I have had an amazing career. I went on to become a graphic designer, I moved up into digital marketing, and I have successfully held positions that would otherwise require a degree. I'm not dumb. I'm well-read. I am ambitious.

 It never impacted my earning potential, either - I earn six figures. It never impacted my career choices. I hold a Senior Director position in my current job and I am Vice President of a startup on the side.

I am exceptionally talented coupled with being hardworking and driven. My resume is impressive and my work history speaks for itself.

Yet I have come to realize that my lack of a degree doesn't impact career opportunities as much as impacts potential relationships. I happen to organically connect with well-educated people, but there have been more than a few times where I bring up my lack of a college degree and I see their faces fall with disappointment. On more than one occasion, their interest in me dramatically dropped and how they even spoke to me changed almost immediately...treating me like I am stupid or as though nothing I say is based on fact.

One incident stands out where after I disclosed that I don't have a degree, he openly doubted absolutely everything I said, to the point where I googled things back to back in front of him to prove what I was saying had a factual basis. It was a humiliating and embarrassing feeling to go through.

Maybe it's the way I bring it up - I will work into conversation whenever we bring up our college or university experiences.

45,nzxvfu,1623707045,Need advice for taking it slow when we’ve already talked about the future,"Hi all. I’ve (37F) recently reconnected with someone (40M) casually dated 7 years ago, right before I moved cross-country. We’ve stayed friends over the years, not close, but checking in on social media. He even said in a Facebook comment about a year ago that if we’re single in a few years he’d come to wherever I was and marry me. He was in a relationship at the time and I replied pointed that out in my reply, then moved on, but we never really stopped being sweet on each other. 

Well guess what, he’s single again and recently moved to the coast that I’m on, just over 2 hours north of me. He messaged me and invited me up to hang out, and we flirted for a few weeks before I drove up for the weekend. I didn’t know what to expect, worried I’d regret it, etc. 

The weekend was AMAZING. We are still very much attracted to each other, but also able to just sit quietly and not need to fill the silence. I teased him about the marriage comment and he was like well I kind of meant it and I haven’t changed my mind. We got into a lot of serious topics like what we want for our futures, that we want this to work out but we’re both scared, even brought up finances. It was magical and TBH completely nuts to even mention it. 

I’ve been on a high for about a week, we’re still messaging or talking on the phone every day, he is giving me no indication of disappearing. But, I have serous anxiety and a really messed up attachment style, and I can feel myself freaking out and wanting to pull away already. We definitely want to see where it goes, but agreed that we should take it slow. The distance will help a LOT, but in the meantime I have no idea how to relax and enjoy the present without worrying (too much) about the future. I’m also trying to find the line between vulnerability and insecurity, since one’s a good way to build connection, and the other is decidedly not a good look. 

I have very little relationship experience, but I’m in therapy and I’m bringing up these anxieties this week. What advice do you have for this situation?

46,nzxw1x,1623707090,Do I see her again or not?,"A while back I spent a full week with someone from out of town and it was the best time I’ve had in years.  Definitely the best with someone who was just a date, not a gf (I’m lesbian for reference).

She disappeared one day and it was very hard on me.  Recently reconnected and she said she just needed space and we kinda just planned a weekend together in a couple weeks.  I’m dating several other women so it isn’t a desperation thing. 

I am lost bc I don’t know if there’s any long term potential at all, and I don’t know if I’m making a mistake for my emotional health.

The first problem, long term potential.  There are half a dozen reasons why it shouldn’t work, but yet we do very well together.  I’m happy with her, but even beyond infatuation I actually feel peaceful, and for an anxious type A that’s a rarity.  Is that kind of connection something that overrides other shortcomings?

Second is is this bad for my emotional health?  Bc I miss her terribly, and even cry at my desk if I think about what happened.  I’m not really getting over her apart, so I guess I feel like how can a visit make things worse?  Maybe it’s closure or a different perspective that will come from this?  

I’ll be out of dating for 3 months anyway soon.  It feels like I’m not going to pursue anything serious anyway, so what’s the harm?

49,nzyice,1623708763,How to handle driving distance in a relationship?,"I just had to break another date with a guy a was getting to know. He was my type physically and we seemed to have the same over-analytical sense of humor. He lived 2 hours away from me and we would usually meet for our dates a town an hour away for both of us. I asked about his schedule and he didn't have any time he could see me except maybe for a lunch. We have been going back and forth for three months and today we mutually decided that the distance was just too much with our work schedules. We both wanted to see one another it was just too far when you combined appointments and work schedules. 

I live in a small rural town and I don't want to date anyone from there. The closest ""city"" is 45 minutes to one hour and thirty minutes away. Does anyone have any advice or have had to navigate a similar issue? I have certainly decided that I do not want to have a relationship where I never get to see the person and I would like to avoid any pitfalls.

51,nzymek,1623709086,One-sided Conversations,"I've been getting back into dating apps and have talked a bunch of women but  I find they often devolve into one-sided conversations where I'm asking all the questions and they're answering. They don't ask anything about me. It feels like an interview. And they take sometimes days to reply. And these are all women who messaged me first by the way.Eventually the conversations all wind down until either me or them stop talking out of disinterest. I thought maybe I was boring or something but maybe it's just them, maybe they lack conversational skills and don't know how to get to know people? I don't know but it's frustrating.Anybody else experience this? What do women want in a conversation when they first start talking?  
Edit: some questions I have asked are ""What do you do for fun?"" when they have nothing in bio about interests, or I'll specifically ask about their interests, like asking a girl really into Japan ""What got you so interested in Japan?""

First and foremost, do you look more at how long you’ve known someone or number of dates when considering any of the things below or other milestones?

In general, when do you think the following should typically happen (assuming they happen at all):

Discussing/agreeing to be exclusive
Labels (boyfriend and girlfriend, or whatever!)
Meeting friends
Meeting family
Overnight dates
Travel together
Any of the other many stages or steps I’m forgetting!

53,nzyzj4,1623710126,Why do men love bomb?,"I don't mean for this to be a gendered thing, but I (32F) have experienced it from men countless times since I was maybe 15, so correct me if I'm wrong about it being mostly men. The severity has ranged from relatively harmless to practically abuse. Several of my female friends have also experienced this so I know it is almost always about the man himself, and never just about the victims. 

What happens is this: I match with a man (or back in my early to mid 20's when I had more of a social life, meet a man in person), and almost immediately get showered with compliments, a free drink, lots of attention, etc. In the beginning, it just feels like flirting, but it doesn't take long before it starts to become sketchy. They make you feel really fucking special, reply to your texts right away, and basically tell you everything a person would want to hear. Maybe I have a lot of experience with love bombers because  I respond strongly to words of affirmation... not sure, but it's truly been blowing my mind how often it's happened to me. 

If you give a love bomber an inch, they'll take a mile. But then the actual bomb drops. I want to say for the majority of whatever type of relationship we were in, the love bomber has been the one to leave ME. They hype me up, only to leave me completely hanging. This has happened to me from something as simple as a Bumble match that turned into texting that turned into a phone call and the man said he was falling for me right away... the texts and phone calls happened for two days after and then he just completely ghosted me --- to the most extreme form: my ex husband did it to me at the beginning of our relationship, gaslit me for most of our marriage, then left me when I (kindly) called him out on it. 

So my question is, WHY?! Do these men do this with every woman they meet, or just a select few that they might think would be vulnerable? Is it because movies romanticize love bombers? Am I too trusting? What is the point of telling a woman that you just met that she's the most amazing person you've ever met, only to just ghost them? This isn't ghosting after sex, or even after the first date. It's after no date, or after the fourth date, or after six months.

59,o01ma3,1623718267,What's it like to even have a conversation on a date anymore?,"Maybe this is just down to bad luck....maybe this is how it is right now....maybe I'm just rusty.

Didn't date much during the last year.  With a mix of lockdowns and general reticence, I put dating on the backseat, and focused on a mix of other things, mostly trying to put other parts of my life in order.  As things have gradually reopened, I've waded back into it again, trying to feel out new connections.

Something seems....off, though.  Conversations with a lot of my dates don't seem like conversations anymore.  I tend to just get a lot of grief for, well, having opinions.  Not even controversial opinions....just opinions.  Is the way people interact different?  I've been on more dates with a slightly younger crowd....is there a generational difference?

By way of example: Music is a big part of my life.  I have things I like, and things I don't.  Maybe getting older, I know myself better, more about what I like and what I don't, and why.  But I'm not into knocking other people down - by all means, have your own opinions, whatever they are.  Much of the time, I really don't care if we agree or not - especially if the topic is trivial.  At the bare minimum, I'll put my opinion out, hoping my date will just offer up her own, and we'll see what we agree on or not.

On recent dates, when I bring up what I like, and talk about why I like it, I get a lot of  ""wrinkled nose, angry face"" expressions, followed by a lengthy diatribe about why I'm closed-minded and how I need to work on that.  It's....weird.

On one date, I caught hell for talking about how much I enjoyed Romanticism, and I was accused of ignoring the value of both the Baroque and the postmodern.  I never even mentioned either.  On another date, talking about how important music was to me \*in general\* resulted in a stern and angry lecture about the emotional impact of (literally) sign-language poetry (and the rebuke came from an individual who can't understand ASL).  This is....really esoteric stuff.  I feel like I'm catching a lot of snark and anger from things that...really shouldn't provoke it at all.

Has the way people express their own opinions now devolved into yelling them at you, angrily?  I was used to this on some troll forums, but a lot less in person.

For years I hung around with people, and we'd just toss out opinions into the air, and we would either agree or not.  Disagreements mostly boiled down to a lot of indifference or tolerance - the worst disagreements usually came down to ""ok, whatever"".  ""I like Monet paintings"" wasn't an invitation for the Raphael fans in the crowd to yell at you.  There wasn't a lot of ""judging"" going on.  I don't get that affable, free feeling anymore when I date.  It's like everything I might say is really just a provocation for my date to jump down my throat.  Kinda makes me not even want to talk to new people, or every time I open my mouth, to brace for the impending explosion.

He's taken some of my texts as melancholy, like when girls act depressed to get attention. That wasn't my intention at all, I was actually kinda really happy. With that instance, I told him, starting out that if things didn't work between us, I would really also like to have him as a friend because I enjoyed his company so much. He's like a kindred spirit and I've not met even a friend that I share this much in common with. 

What was supposed to be read as, ""Woah, dude, I'm digging you even as a friend."" Got translated into ""I want reassurance that you like me.""

Everything got resolved. No worries there but it did raise some red flags that maybe he's been in relationships with emotional manipulators in the past. Or, I guess red flag isn't the right term, he's great. 

Now, today, he said he was going to come to my place tomorrow. I was super excited because I wasn't expecting to see him so soon. Then, he got to work and his buddy is having his birthday tomorrow and they're going bowling. He asked if I would like to go and I told him I wasn't sure because I don't ever know when I'll get out of work BUT I told him that he should for sure go, just in case he needed to tell him in advance that he was going. Figured I would wait and see about work tomorrow. 

I feel like I came off as too reassuring. It's a problem, I'm a nurturer and I can't help it. He has visible signs of abuse and it's like I want to cuddle them. 

Normally he talks to me after work but today he said he had to go because he was out. I was like ok...oh god, I feel like I fucked up and my means for fixing it are overcompensating.

I’ve dated a few other guys in the last year. Nothing has worked out with any of them. A couple have lasted for around 2 months or so.

Someone to spend my weekends with, someone to go to the gym with, and etc. Is it possible to keep my fwb around, and find a serious relationship?

87,o0cxw0,1623759278,"In your 30s, have you ever resumed dating a person you broke it off with? Did it end up working in the end?","I (35F) have had a series of short-term dating partners over the past two years. Each situation lasted about 2 to 4 months, some of the longer ones had reached the point of agreeing to date exclusively. They all tended to fade (mutual loss of interest on both ends) or my male partner decided the relationship wouldn't work for him in the long term (which I completely understand and move on from). I'll note that I also try my best to screen for people seeking long-term commitments as I'm not interested in FWBs.

I'm not entirely certain if this is a pandemic phenomenon (particularly since I haven't dated much except for the last years), but several of these men ""return"" months after we've broken off contact. They will suddenly call or text me out of the blue as if we are just catching up like old friends. I definitely sense they are testing if I am receptive to meeting again, but there's no direct reference to what happened between us (i.e., there's no ""I'm sorry I was going through a rough time a few months ago but wanted to see if we can pick up where we left off""). 

Because I'm only seeking long-term relationships, I've basically cut off all the men who attempted to resume contact. My assumption is that most of them tried returning to the dating market, didn't like their options, and are reconsidering me again--or maybe they are hoping for an easy hookup to hold them over until they find someone. But now I'm wondering if I'm being unfair in my judgment.

How likely is it that these people are truly interested in giving the relationship a second shot? If you've been the person who has attempted to return later, were your intentions genuine?

I think this is all mainly in my head, and I'm definitely going to talk to them about it, but I'm wondering if anyone else is feeling similar? I feel like there's so much pressure now to have all these hobbies and activities to prove you're well-rounded or interesting!",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/o0fv02/feeling_weird_now_that_things_are_opening_back_up/

93,o0hh0g,1623772124,What is with all this catfishing?,"I know this is a common complaint, but I just had a date last night where I immediately screamed when I got home.

I've (38F) been on apps for about 7 months now, and have not rushed into anything. I've been selective on who I actually talk to and confirm dates with, only 3 men. 2 of these 3 have catfished (kittenfished?) me with photos (and height) that completely misrepresented them. The first kittenfish said he was 6'2 when he was eye level to me, and gained considerable weight. I didn't recognize him. The one guy that actually ended up cuter than his photos I'm still seeing.

This guy last night looked really adorable in his photos. He omitted what he did for a living, but I've kept an open mind to these things, and implies he's an illustrator, which I was really excited about.

I show up early and wait there, looking cute after 2 hours of makeup, hair, perfume, outfit selection. Out of the corner of my eye, I see a scraggly man approaching, long stringy unwashed hair to his shoulders, a rolled out of bed outfit, scraggle teeth, the works. I hide my panic face and stand up to greet him, and he shies away from hugging or looking at me. This guy looks like he's gone through hell. I am warm to him for the hour+ we had drinks (I am a people pleaser, don't come at me). I ask him all the questions because he barely asks me anything, and get him going on the things he's into. Completely different from texting mannerisms. Turns out he doesn't illustrate, but works at a grocery store, and admits he should probably try illustrating. We split the check. I get up and consider if I should give a hug, but I can tell he senses I'm trying to get out of there, he has this smirk on his face, and I just leave. We haven't spoken because HE KNOWS WHAT HE DID.

Do people really think they can put photos out there from 10+ years ago and think it's okay?  I ask my friends to review my profile and make sure it represents me. Are people not doing the same? This is just blowing my mind. Have you experienced this level of misrepresentation out there?",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/o0hh0g/what_is_with_all_this_catfishing/

95,o0ht2j,1623773006,Is excitement necessary or did we watch too many rom-coms?,"I'm 32f seeing a 41m. This relationship is different than any other I've been in. We started as friends for a few months before getting physical or romantic. For the first few years it was more of an exclusive FWB thing because he lived almost two hours away. Now that he's much closer to where I live, we've become more serious. I used to find myself going after the tough masculine type, but my current partner is definitely not that way, but not exactly feminine either. He's nice, he's empathetic, provides for himself and his two teenage sons, has no criminal history, no violent tendencies, he's reliable and dependable, financially stable, smart, and dotes on me when he's around me. He's very nice to my 10-year-old. The problem is though, if there even is one, is that there's not the passion I'm used to having. He's 10 days into a 14 day work trip out of state, and we've texted, but haven't talked on the phone once. Granted, our sleeping schedules are opposite since he works nights, but I just feel like maybe once in 10 days we'd have found a way if it was wanted enough. I brought this up last night and he did call me and leave a voicemail at midnight, so it's not like he isn't trying. There was one exchange of ""I love you's"" the morning he left, but neither of us have said it since then, not even in the voicemail he left me. I like having him around when he is, but I can't say I feel the can't live without you missing him feeling. Yes, the best course of action is communicating this concern with him, and I have, but is a spark or passion something you can communicate your relationship into? We either love each other enough to say it often or miss each other enough to find time to hear each other's voices, or we don't. Or have we been so conditioned to believe these are all necessary when it's actually a fantasy?",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/o0ht2j/is_excitement_necessary_or_did_we_watch_too_many/

98,o0imxb,1623775213,Men’s emotions in the early stages,"I’m talking to this man for the past few weeks and it’s (somehow) going well. I have a history of anxious attachment and self sabotage, so this is kinda new to me. The communication is very easy for the first time, and I’m somewhat in the ‘waiting for the other boot to drop’ stage. 
I’m also comparing my feelings with what he might be feeling at the same time, but I’m coming up empty because, like I mentioned, this has never happened to me before. 
So men on this sub, can you share how you are feeling in those first few weeks when things are going well but nothing is decided yet? 
Thanks.",datingoverthirty,t5_34cyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/o0imxb/mens_emotions_in_the_early_stages/
