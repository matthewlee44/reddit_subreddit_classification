1,ow34ts,1627861504,Places to actually meet single people these days,"I'm in Oklahoma City, well just outside of it. When I moved here I didn't think I'd be struggling to find people to hang out with, let alone date. I'm a bit of a homebody. I work from home, I play at home, I'm just comfortable at home unless I'm visiting my family or running quick errands. The town I am in is very...uppity and people have routines and mostly stay indoors and don't seem overly friend like I'm used to where I moved from. I've made a few neighbor friends but I'm in a new (rock bottom) period of my life where I will begin dating after over a decade of marriage. 

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see it from a probably skewed logic standpoint is this - my options are severely limited at current time due to the following reasons:

* C-19 as a blanket social issue keeping people inside
* I work from home job (met my wife at work 14 year ago)
* Non-drinker. Non-smoker. Just nothing I'd enjoy.
* Not many local friends (and the ones I have are also fairly new here, so not many connections
* Dating apps are full of, well, less  than stellar people that either just want to hookup, or are absolutely not my type physically. Yeah weird I'm a guy that has no interest in a useless f\*ck

&amp;#x200B;

The above issues aside, I figure I could make myself a regular at a local coffee shop and work from there. I hate cardio so parks are out, but I'm getting a gym membership because I'm physically not big or attractive and need \*something\* to keep me from going absolutely insane. I'm into photography, and I like to do some light offroading in my Jeep. Each of those things opens at least a few opportunities - but my lizard brain is telling me I'm an idiot and to go with despair.

&amp;#x200B;

If you were in my shoes, what changes would you make? Where would you go? I've technically never really dated - I'm a noob.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ow34ts/places_to_actually_meet_single_people_these_days/
2,ow35xe,1627861615,FWB Confusion,"TL:DR - Have strong feelings for my FWB, think he feels similarly, but don't know what to do about our relationship or how to make it less complicated.

Backstory: I've (32F) been ""seeing"" this guy (38M) off and on since about May (started talking to him back in January). We initially started out wanting to date but settled into a FWB kinda relationship. He's really kind, listens to my problems, and the sex is absolutely amazing. I've definitely caught feelings, and I think he has too given the way he treats me. But he's very comfortable with our relationship as is. I've told him I am as well but I'd really like more if I'm being completely honest about it, which is why I started dating a guy in June. I reluctantly told my FWB after a few dates (he also picked up on it pretty quickly when I suddenly started being out at night) because I didn't feel right not saying anything, but I also didn't want to lose something great for something completely uncertain. He understood and suggested we press pause so I could focus on this new potential relationship.

As you might imagine, the new relationship went nowhere and the guy ended it after about a month. It left me completely drained emotionally and I've found it incredibly difficult to fall back into the really nice relationship I've had with my FWB. I've hung out with him a few times but kept it strictly platonic because I didn't want to lead him on if that's not where my mind is at. He could clearly tell something was off but was sweet about it and didn't make me feel pressured at all. He's told me he completely understands and respects where I'm coming from, that his feelings about our relationship haven't changed, and that I needed to do what's best for me even if that meant us just being friends for a little bit. I playfully suggested we get together for birthday sex so long as we could keep it uncomplicated but he had plans that weekend.

Most recently, we hung out a few days ago and kept it semi platonic. We cuddled, snuggled, kissed here and there, etc. Nothing more physical than that, though we did share a passionate kiss goodbye. I joked with him the other day that I think he was trying to seduce me but he said that wasn't the case and knew where my head was that night with respect to having sex. That lead to a conversation about how I feel sex is too complicated right now because of all the emotions we have for each other. The more I know him, the more I love him and the more unwilling I become to risk losing what we have. I told him we should probably keep things status quo for the moment and he said he understood. I think he was upset but he assured me he wasn't and that it wouldn't change how he felt about me or how he would treat me. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I really want to go back to the way things were before we pressed pause but I'm struggling to get there. I just don't have the capacity for complicated and I don't know how to uncomplicate it. Thanks everyone.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ow35xe/fwb_confusion/
3,ow398b,1627861951,What should I do next?,"Hey guys, 

I hope everyone is doing well. At work, I met this girl and talked a bit, with some light, mutual flirting mixed in. I’m a very jokey guy, and she was responding well to it.

I was about to go on vacation and had no way to contact her and she was taking her two weeks to quit the job; so it was all or nothing. As she was leaving her shift, I ran over and asked for her number and gave it to me with a totally blushed face (As was mine). 

So I waited a couple of days and reached out. We texted for a bit and it went pretty well. At the end I sent something that basically indirectly told her that I was into her, if she didn’t already know and said I’ll ttyl. 

Now, should I wait for her to saying something or when should I say something?

I know it might sounds like I’m looking into it a ton, but I’ve been playing my cards well, and wanna stay on a roll. 

Anything would be appreciated",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ow398b/what_should_i_do_next/
4,ow39q5,1627862002,Why does this guy talk to me?,"I have so much confusion over this situation. So I had a thing happen over a year ago with a guy I had sex with once. It was just a fling kind of thing. I had a guy I was sleeping with but he wasn't doing it well enough for me. So I sought out for someone else just for a day to play with. I spent much of the evening with him and then we hooked up and that was it texted him a few times that next week really. So befre that point I had texted him every now and then and knew nothing about him so it was never anything I wanted from him on that level. In fact when I wanted to meet up with him it was for a hook up only from my perspective. Well what I did was ask to meet up we did a week later. And I meant for sex. But what was weird was that instead of hooking up he picked me up and brought a friend along the whole evenning. Went different places bore me completely because he was so much younger and I didn't know that. I thought he was 19 but he was 18 in high school And I was in my mid 20's at the time. So I thought that was that right.

Fast forward a bit then in july he blocked me because I snapped him who was this? LOL. So until christmas, there was no communication. I was feeling silly and stupid that way. So I texted him a long crazy message on how I felt about him different than I did other guys. And all this sort of stuff I messaged him anonymously. Well then that march he liked my profile and we started texting but the thing is such dry texting at that point. I got bored and was annoyed. So a few months later I told him that it was me who texted him during christmas. Hoping he would block me. He mostly ignored me and didn't respond to me but after that did not block me and only responded rather shortly... Well july 4rth came and instead of continuing to ignore me asks if I have instagram and said he wanted to meet up. Well that didn't work out because I was on my period. And going out of town. Right when I go out of town he said he would be interested in meeting up some time after I came back into town. So when I come into town he seemed more talkative. But like today we were talking about him going to the gym working out and him wanting to bulk up and it's weird it's like odd that I said he looked good the way he was. And made me say it again.

What I don't get is what he wants from me. He says he wants to meet up and reaches out and then doesn't actually meet up. So I don't get why he reached out and all that?

I am not really looking for any guy right now not until really october. But I am of the mentality if he wanted to meet up for sex today then that would be fine and if not Idc. Because either way I wasnt really looking for sex or anything more either. Definitely not looking for anything serious until october but really have not looked for sex in about 4 months. Don't mind making it 6 months either.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ow39q5/why_does_this_guy_talk_to_me/

6,ow3le2,1627863171,Best way to start talking with someone you haven’t seen in two years?,"So back in high school, there was this guy (20M now) who messaged me (19F) a random meme one night of the out of the blue. We’d never talked before so I assumed this was his way of starting a conversation because he liked me. However, we were both super shy idiots and so even though I thought he was really cute, I let the conversation die after that. We talked very briefly in classes over the years and I saw one of his friends try to get him to talk to me but nothing ever came of it.

We’re both in college now (different schools), going into sophomore year, and I still think about him a lot. I’m taking a break from school for the fall and staying in an apartment right by his college so it’s a perfectly feasible relationship logistics wise. I think about him and regret not taking chances back then often enough that I’ve sort of decided I want to contact him and take a chance that we can start something but I have NO CLUE how to do that. 

If I text him directly myself, I’m worried that he won’t be single so it’ll be awkward or even just that it’ll be a really weird conversation since we were never really friends. I’ve considered messaging one of his friends who I talked to very few times in school to ask if he’s single even though that’s going to be a painful conversation. If I want anything to happen, I have to be forward which is very out of my personality. I have a close friend who used to be friends with the guy who I could approach about helping me if he’s comfortable with it.

How do I initiate things in a way that’s not horridly uncomfortable or awkward while also not rushing into things without knowing if he’s single?

TLDR: Want to start talking to my old crush from high school who liked me back then but don’t know how to do it since we haven’t seen each other in years, weren’t close enough to consider each other friends and don’t really have mutual friends.

The moment they see one of these things or a combination of them, most people just don’t bother. Every once in awhile, you get a “How come you’re like that?” and upon telling them why, they go “oh” and dump your ass whenever possible.

So yeah, trying to weed out. Unfortunately, doing so hasn’t led to any matches.

26,ow4jfh,1627866846,"When you reject or fetishize someone based on the color of their skin, you are racist","Its not just ""preferences"" I am sorry. If you reject or fetishize someone based on race you are a fucking racist.

Racism is considered one the most heinous sins in the western society so people use colorful language to absolve themselves. They will also use cultural tropes to create a feel good environment where they don't feel like they are racist anymore like using #BLM on their Instagram or their dating profiles. 

What is pathetic about racism in dating is that a lot of it is driven by the general perception of various groups in the media. You can clearly see how the race/gender pairings of groups that are fetishized by Hollywood just seem to do better in dating.

Here are some more points to think about in no particular order:

\- Racism in dating is no different than having a rainbow colored logo for your company and systematically not hiring equally qualified black people over white people. You can't say you have a preference against Black people because of all the violence and misandry in rap culture. Let me remind you that the reason racism is considered so bad is because it dehumanizes people, takes away their individuality and marginalizes them...the same thing when you say I don't date race X because of yada yada.

\- A lot of people say ""its just the culture"". In online dating, chances are you are likely not even exploring their culture but just swiping them away based on...the color of the skin. That is racism. In real life, I have seen my ""Black passing"" South Indian and Sri Lankan friends do fine. I have also seen my ""Italian passing"" Middle Eastern friends do fine. I have also seen my ""Hispanic passing"" Asian friends also do fine. Same culture but more acceptable skin color. That is racism.

\- You see disparity in success between genders of different races based on who is fetished in Hollywood. Asian Women do fine, Asian Men don't. Black men do fine, Black women don't. All of this is pathetic because you are rejecting or fetishing people by reducing them into a dehumanized version based on stereotypes. 

\- You will also often see the successful gender of a particular race regurgitate the common stereotypes against the other gender of the same race as perpetuated by the media and society. So for example, you will see Asian women talk about how ""I don't date Asian men because they just look like my brothers"". For Black men, dating out seems to be a status thing. Same cultural, same genes but just how the environment telling them how they should think of themselves. If you go back to their home countries, you will likely not hear anyone use these talking points. No one in China is thinking about dating their siblings when they date each other. No one in Africa swears off Black women for not being feminine enough. This is internalized racism. Its racism.

Now, as a man of color who often gets gaslighted when I bring up these topics here is what I have to say. The western economy is very dependent on immigration and the west actively recruits males from abroad with the promise of a fair and egalitarian society. Please don't expect us to come to the west, chop off our dicks and join the ranks of the tax paying unsullied. We are also American and Canadian and British and become very productive members of the society but still a lot of people usually reduce immigrants, specially males as ""others with a different culture"". We need sex and relationships just as much as others.

This does not go away even for generations either. People in these countries often talk about equality and mental health and all the nice things but when it comes to finding a partner suddenly all kinds of racism is acceptable. Go browse some of these ethnic subs or dating related subs and see how young POC kids grow up with terrible self-image problems, loneliness, depression etc because of all the rejection based on skin color ""preferences"". Imagine being a perfectly upstanding brown kid who did well for himself career wise and gets zero matches in online dating just because people have a ""preference"" for another skin while he sees that white stoner from school just do fine. I would like to see a more positive attitude where instead of just brushing them off as ""others"" people say, ""hey how do we help the newest members of the society settle in and find meaningful relationships. Do we need to educate them about this stuff? Do they need more representation in the media? Do we need a shift in our own attitude?"".",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ow4jfh/when_you_reject_or_fetishize_someone_based_on_the/

28,ow4nnr,1627867309,How can I attract the type of men I'm interested in? Could my figure be an issue?,"It occurred to me that while a good amount of men are attracted to me --  the type of men I'm most interested in don't seem to pursue me. I  study/work in STEM and am typically interested in reserved, introverted, analytical men also working in STEM...much like myself! Based on our  interactions, I think I catch their attention, but it doesn't translate into me being romantically pursued. I am asked out much more frequently by  more...'charismatic' or extroverted men.

I  am conventionally attractive, and I regularly receive corroboration of this through my daily interactions...I am not at all seeking validation or humble-bragging. I am genuinely only offering description to better describe my concerns. I have a thin hourglass figure (5'4'', 110  lbs).  My bra size is 28G, and my waist is 23 inches. Because I started developing breasts at a  young age, I, like many other women, have had a very complicated  relationship with my body. (I have also experienced considerable sexual harassment that has negatively  affected my mental health during different periods of my life.)

I do feel that men approach me for serious relationships but just not the men I think I'd be most compatible with. I am worried that the type of men I'm interested in see me as 'too sexy' -- and not someone they'd be   inclined to approach for a long term relationship. I sometimes worry that the men that do pursue me try to make it work only because they  enjoy my appearance. I feel really low...and unworthy of love...when I  am in this headspace.

I believe I  dress 'appropriately' per social circumstances. I would describe my style as a feminine, classic, and clean-cut...I try to be careful with  clothing items that might be too fitted -- and rarely show any cleavage  (never at work, of course). But I also feel that there's a double  standard in that clothing worn by women with larger breasts is just perceived as more overtly sexual.

I  completely understand that plenty of men just prefer smaller  breasts  -- and/or may just may not be personally attracted to me.

44,ow5sx6,1627871852,I have no idea what to do. Please offer any words of advice.,"Please be patient because this is a bit of a story..

Let me start by saying I am a single mom, have been for quite a few years and left an abusive relationship of 6 years in 2015 with my babies. 

A few years ago (August 2018) I reconnected with an old friend who lived a few hours away from me. We went on our first date and it was by far the best date I've ever been on. After 2 months of spending each weekend we could together, we decided to start officially dating and a month after that I introunced him to my kids, my best friends and my brother. 

By December 2019, he decided to move down to my city, not in with me but in his own place so we weren't moving to fast, but so that we could see eachother more often and have him slowly fit into my everyday life with kids. Things were pretty awesome, we did adventures like rock climbing  and plane tours, and camping and kayaking etc etc. For the first time in my life, my partner felt like my best friend. 

But exactly 1 week before his official move down, we had decided to have some friends over to his house for drinks and games. On this night my sister in law (my brothers wife and my best friend) and my boyfriend got very drunk, and I went to bed at 11pm. It was then that he went to walk her home, but she couldn't find her key, so of course he said she could sleep in the spare room. 
She went to bed. 

Around 2am my boyfriend was the only one awake, but started sending inappropriate messages to my sister in law. Talking about wanting to have sex  seemingly with her, all in all. She told him she would show me all this in the morning, and he claimed it was a ""joke"". 

Apparently a bit after that, she awoke to see him standing next to her bed. And her underwear were.. off? down? I'm not sure, my understanding of the situation is pretty confused because I'm scared to talk about the topic and clarify.. but anyways..

At 7am I woke up and went to see if she was awake and she said she had some things to tell me.

In the end she believes she was sexually assaulted by the boyfriend. The boyfriend was convinced he wouldn't do that and admitted to being in the room but only to unplug and replug in his internet router so he could do some late night gaming with friends.

So I was faced with a decision, believe her, or believe him. 🤔I tried to do both... which doesn't work btw. 

I finally found love and couldn't believe he would do that to her, however  the sex text messages were enough to make a less forgiving (but probably way more self respecting) girlfriend leave the relationship. 

But I had been through so much ""worse"" things in the past it seemed, surley I could forgive something no one could even confirm. Also based on the facts that I didn't really believe he touched her, I didnt want to lose him, or have my kids lose him.. I chose to stay dating him. 

After a few weeks, the guilt of staying with someone who might have done that to my sister in law/bestfriend, weighed too heavy and I broke up with him. By the end of January 2020, a weight had been lifted, my relationship with my sister in law and my brother went back to normal, or so they thought. But for me everything changed.. we still got along  we were still bestfriends, I faked it really well because I wanted it to be normal again so badly.

But everytime I was with her over the past 20 months, Id think of him. It's been almost 2 years since I broke up with him, and my kids still desperately want to see him, they still cry. It's come to the point where I'm sure I'm still in love with him...

But how could I be? After what maybe happened? My brother can never walk me down the isle on my wedding day to him... 

The boyfriend has been in therapy ever since it happened, to talk about his black our drinking, and is now attending AA meetings. He loves me still, and would do anything to be with me and the kids again. 

I told her this, and she said she was willing to maybe talk to him, because she thought he was good to me, I was so happy  and she sees that happiness and future I had dreamed up for he and I, was also ripped from me that day. 

However my brother, will never consider it  and I dont blame him at all, but now I wonder if I'm always going to be trapped by this idea that I need my brothers approval. Because it's always been that way, being as he was my main male figure in my life growing up he was my best friend.  

So let's break it down..
Did I make the right choice 2 years ago, picking her over him, even if I didn't believe the accusation?

Am I emotionally scarred and desperate for love and thats why I want to be with him again so badly?

Is it even worth a conversation with my brother to tell him how badly I want this man back in my life? 

Am I just fkn stupid?! 🤔🥴

Afterwards we made our way up to her room as we were both pretty tired at this point. She made it very clear she wanted me to stay over and not go home. We made out for some time and I gently and slowly went to take things further. Before proceeding I opened up and let her know that I wasn't just a physical minded guy and that I liked her very much. Letting her know I value emotions and intimacy very highly. Saying that I was totally fine with taking things slow. She didn't say anything at all and after a pause we continued kissing shortly after. I considered moving forward when things got a little more intense and passionate slowly making my way to her pants and she brought up my hand. I got the message that perhaps she wasn't ready which I totally respect however she didn't engage to talk about it once I brought it up. A little later into hooking up she began to tease me a little by going to my lower regions as though she was confused about whether to go further. The night ended well and we both ended up sleeping and still being very cuddly and intimate together. However I'm just confused on if there was a deep reason as to why she didn't want to go a little further and wondering why she didn't even walk to briefly talk about it.

I haven't dated before so that's definitely a scary thought. She is super cool. But I dont know for sure if she likes me. She does recently engage a conversation with me. And in group conversation our eyes do meet, but she is a nice and non shy person. So maybe she is just a cool chick.

I'm an average looking black guy, he's an average looking white guy, his profile isn't a blow you away profile, he has a few pics and that's about it.


But enough of that, I've been told way too many times by numerous buddies that dating apps aren't really in a black guys favor at all, it's really a grind if you're a black male on dating apps, especially Tinder. 

I managed to finally get two matches and this comes after months of not getting any activity on my profiles, ""Finally!smh"" is what I thought, after having a nice convo with the girl she agreed to meetup for lunch, and just when I was about to seal the deal it happens....""You do know my rates right?"" Excuse me? I asked. She sends me a text of prices, 30 minutes $$$ 1hr $$$ Spend the night $$$. I turned her down and said I wasn't interested. I was beyond furious.

A girl I used to talked to reached out to me also, haven't seen her in months, we talked for a bit, agreed to go out, when I told her I was getting ready ro come pick her up she blatantly asks me am I bringing her any money because she's broke, mind you I cut her off before because she kept trying to find ways to get money out of me. 

My roommate came back in and ask me what did I think of this girl that liked his profile, she was gorgeous, I told him she looks great, and to make plans with her, he gives me this uneasy look and says, ""Eh, her face is a little weird to me."" Showed me another girl, she was also cute, he says ""Eh, I just don't like the way her hair looks."" in my head I'm like wow, he's really nit picking, but hey he's got options I guess.

I stay trying to hold on to my profiles ""just in case"" but I feel like I'm lying to myself. 0 likes on multiple profiles for months, while my roommate literally get likes and matches everyday in the same area, really made me sit back and realize this dating app thing is a waste of time, and I'll be an adult here and admit that it has definitely taken a toll on my self esteem, yeah it sounds stupid, but I'd be lying if I said I was okay.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ow740c/i_think_i_really_think_i_should_take_a_break/

I felt like I was putting in a bit more effort then he was so I took a step back and he messaged me after five days. I sent him a message asking where his head was at and how he felt, I worded it very well and I said if you aren't interested I would rather you tell me because we are both adults and don't want to waste each others time. He said he was still 'keen to catch up' and apologised for not replying sooner. 

We talked a bit more and I sort of still feel like I am into him more then he is into me. I haven't heard from him for the whole week. Any suggestions on what to do? I feel like I should just walk away now and move on, he has been online so he could have easily send a quick message to check in.

Since we went out, she has been responding to my texts very infrequently. She left me on read last night, but I decided to call her today because texting is boring anyway. She picked up, and agreed to go out to eat again next week.

I have a lot in common with her and were even born in the same home country. I really enjoy her company. I am planning on taking her to a restaurant near my apartment, and if it goes well, take her back to my apartment to hang out, possibly have some wine and listen to music.

Was that supposed to be a date, or just hanging out? Does she like me? Or is this not enough info to know the answer.

Is there some perception that this is somehow different on OLD?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ow94zc/girls_why_do_i_rarely_if_ever_get_asked_any/
96,ow97h1,1627886811,Still using Tinder while dating a person.,"Hi there! 
So I met a girl on Tinder few weeks ago. We met after couple days of talking and had sex on first date. We were dating for few weeks, i think it clicked. Spending a lot of time together, going out, kissing and cuddling. After first week or so of this relationship she received notification from Tinder which bothered me a little that she is still using it, but I thougt that maybe she just got matched with someone. Few weeks later we were cuddling on the couch and another notification came. She said „oh, someone replied to me” and seemed happy about it. I asked and she consfessed that she is still talking to other people. Soo my question is - I am wrong to not feel comfortable with this? We are not couple yet but in my opinion it looks like she is looking further to find some better match than me. She claims that those are just conversations and she is not willing to date anyone beside me. 
I’m a worried that I might be to envious and possessive.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ow97h1/still_using_tinder_while_dating_a_person/

99,ow99wo,1627887172,"Me and my bf are giving things a second chance - is it bad that ""I don't expect much"" but also feel pained that he is as detached as he used to be?","Hello everyone. This will be a long post so bare with me !!!

Just to get straight to the point - it has been almost two years since me and my boyfriend began dating the first time, and while we did break things off for about three months, we rekindled our relationship about two weeks ago. I am 18 years old and he is 17, and while age usually doesn't matter in this context - I just want to express that emotionally I feel I have went through so much more than him in many ways since the breakup. Not to discredit him AT ALL. Because pain shaming here is everything wrong. (But you know just things like handling a miscarriage alone and finding out you're really from another birth father than you believed for 18 years of your life 😭 oh and finding out you have a half sister and a billion cousins ! The usual sighs)

To be frank his reason for breaking up with me is because ""I wasn't confident enough"" and he felt the only way to fix that was to break up with me because his parents also had such an opinion about me (don't even get me started) - let's say after three months of refinding myself...I truly feel like a different woman through my experiences. 

During our stage of talking things over he was very evident of his regrets. He missed me and expressed how there truly wasn't anyone like me, and I agreed to giving this another go and I knew there would be spots that need serious mending, spots that we both were very excited to revisit and spots we could create. This is our second shot and I told him from the get-go that handling everything maturely is the ONLY way to go. No bottling things up anymore. No caring of parents' opinions. It was time to finally enact on what we want while being on board of each other's thoughts and affections.

Fast forward to a few hours ago. We were on FaceTime and had our first teeny tiny qualm I got just a little stuck on. I expressed how ""I don't expect much"" now, but would still be absolutely ecstatic at the thought of him doing the entire ""if he wanted to, he would"" kick. Maybe I was a bit upset seeing my other friends' SO's so proud of them all the time and constantly posting about the small things. Maybe I did expect too much as a little recognition for pulling through and meeting my shitbag birth father's family this weekend and being strong. Which is where the question comes in.

I don't want him to be detached, but I know I need to give him time yet at once it was kind of painful to hear ""you should be realistic""...because maybe I just have so much faith in him. Not that I give up on the vision, I know he can do it, he's just so alienated from expressing with his emotions. 

I know it's only been two weeks but...is it bad to say that in a relationship? That you don't expect much from your partner no matter the context and no matter the length of time? Any advice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ow99wo/me_and_my_bf_are_giving_things_a_second_chance_is/
