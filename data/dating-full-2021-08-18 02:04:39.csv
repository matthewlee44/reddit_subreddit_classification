The company's main business is to provide a wide range of products and services to the market. "" White in the ex-boyfriend finished this sentence when the moment confused, she could not help but ask themselves what kind of life is not dull? Or did she do something wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

White in the past five years she completely adapted to all his habits, and even the future planning have long been ready, just waiting for the man who once loved him deeply, to take her into the hall of marriage.

&amp;#x200B;

But who would have thought that in the first year after graduating from college, her boyfriend would have to break up with her, no quarrel, no reason, just for a different outlook on life.

&amp;#x200B;

The first thing you need to do is to get rid of the problem. Because loving someone who cares about someone, there is compromise, and compromise naturally has a feeling of humility. In a reciprocal emotional relationship, this humility is mutual, is the effort and effort of both men and women to an emotion.

&amp;#x200B;

We are forced to mature and grow old

&amp;#x200B;

Love in real life is not so reciprocal. When you love more and give more, you yourself will find yourself humble!

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, we can't change the ending after all, when Xiaobai was thrown out of the house by the scum, he did not leave anything for Xiaobai, just a ruthless departure of the back. But Xiao Bai took away a lot of things, a pile of useless dolls, and many of his gifts, which is Xiao Bai with five years of flowery youth for all, in addition to these and some fragmented memories.

&amp;#x200B;

We all advised Xiaobai to throw these things away or sell them back home and start a new life, but Xiaobai did not, she rented a house in a city that did not belong to her, and carefully wiped those gifts one by one, neatly placed in the rental room.

&amp;#x200B;

We asked her why she did this, she said: ""Instead of choosing to leave, we should learn to accept"".

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, we can not avoid the same, that left everything, has left, is leaving.

&amp;#x200B;

In a sense, the essence of life is to leave and continue, and between this leaving and continuing, it is insurmountable and confusing and uncomplementary.

&amp;#x200B;

When we tear down the calendar, we will find that yesterday has left. When passing one birthday after another, we will again lament that age is leaving. As all change becomes past tense, we can only accept and acknowledge it, but cannot change the outcome.

&amp;#x200B;

However, when we face parting, leaving a person, a feeling, a memory, but often do not accept not to admit, perhaps, just because, we always expect from the bones, there will be some what because of lingering self-deception unaware and unconscious for us to stay, for us to renew.

&amp;#x200B;

However, growth sometimes does not stop with our slackness and unconsciousness.

&amp;#x200B;

We are forced to mature, forced to grow old, forced to leave one day after another, one year after another. And in the unawareness and unconsciousness and involuntariness, we muddle through the decades and finally face death in the muddle.

&amp;#x200B;

I once saw a passage in another article, he said: ""Since the years have been leisurely disappearing; fading away; then, why make it difficult for yourself, take a step back, let the departure of the departure, everything will also be dark; let the departure of the departure, before you turn away in tears, leaving a simple back; let the departure of the departure, yesterday buried in the bottom of the heart, to themselves to others Leave the most beautiful memories; let the departure of the departure, so that each other have a more relaxed start.""

I'm just a bit confused and a bit new (again) to the single life. I'm getting to know this guy who Ive had a crush on for a year now. He was just my facebook friend and i thought wow he's hella cute. He would message me from time to time and react to my stories but that's it. I didn't really think about it much since I did not want to assume, plus I had a boyfriend then so I didn't want to entertain him.

Anyway, fast forward to 2021, he would reply to my stories on Instagram (I guess he stalked me so he found my ig). I just broke up with my ex then, like a month ago. I don't have many friends and he was the one who offered his shoulder for me to cry on. Which is weird since we're technically still strangers. The rapport was there, so I guess I took that opportunity to rant? Again, I still didn't think he liked me, but after some time he confessed that he has been crushing on me for a long while now, hence the random messages on facebook and instagram.

So I told him he's my FB crush too. We talked every day, but then he got employed as a teacher (congrats yay). At first he still always talked to me. But I guess the amount of workload stopped him from constantly talking to me like he used to? Plus because I confessed, maybe he became complacent?? I sound so shallow. But maybe because even when he's done with work, he's still so slow to reply except when it's the hot stuff (but sometimes he's still slow, it's kinda annoying. how do u progress?). And when he replies, they're usually short. (However, during video calls, he does talk a lot and i can see he's trying to connect. -- which makes me even more confused).

I'm just not used to this because my exes usually had their full attention to me after they're done with work. Also maybe because he's a bit older than me, so sometimes i feel like he gets overwhelmed if I leave a ""lot"" of messages? (Is that an age thing or a generation thing? I'm Gen Z and he's a Millenial. Is that a thing?) I mean, my friends and exes who are of the same age as me are like that, so i just thought it'd be okay if I send him random singing audios or random gossips or something. I'm normally hyper like that. I'm confused. (BTW i sound so clingy and annoying but i'm suppressing and trying to flow along to his beat so not so much, i think. I'm also trying my best not to do the chasing though it's been difficult for me since I'm talkative and extra sweet to people I like). 

I just don't want to adjust and change myself too much, but I also want him to be comfortable. Sometimes i just think ""stop being too clingy, self, and just because they don't reply stat, doesn't mean they don't like you like they say they do. I mean we do have a 'no lying' rule. Some people just like time to themselves and some people just grow up!"" Sigh, but my 2nd love language is quality time, and since i cant get my 1st, the physical touch, i kinda need at least the quality time.

There are times when I would tell myself ""you're not officially together, so don't expect 100% loyalty. maybe he's talking to other girls"" just to remind myself not to expect anything. But when he would want to ""let off steam"" and he'd get turned on and I'd ask why he's turned on, he'd tell me ""because of you, duh."" and ""i'm already talking to you, why would i talk to anyone else?"" - I AM SO CONFUSED. I once told him how i felt like I'm not valued as much, and he got hurt when I said that. He promised to be better. I think he's trying, but maybe that's just the way he is??

My mental health is at its worst (so far) and I just want to talk to him and tell him about it, but suppressing until he gets online (or at least reply fast) is kinda killing me sometimes and I feel a bit neglected. I don't want to feel this way because I know he's very busy and tired most of the time. Sigh, I just don't want to waste my emotions and my time if this doesn't sound like it's gonna work out. Plus, I can't tell him to put me first, since we're not officially dating, LOL.

It's annoying since it's already at the point where hearing his voice and seeing his face comforts me. AHHH I don't know what to do. I studied psych but I can't apply things I've learned to my own life. I can't read his behaviours. HELP.

I’m talking about if I said his name there would be a decent amount of people who knew who he was if you were involved in his community. 

He’s not a 19 year old guy, he’s a man. Like in his late 30s man.

He built a relationship with me off of his career (I can’t say because it might give it away). Slowly got closer to me. I thought he was an amazing guy. Like, same as he portrayed online and just so nice and HONEST!!! 

Online he talks about how “honest” he is and that’s why a lot of people don’t like him. I should have seen that as a red flag. 

We engaged in consensual sex. I offered a condom. He convinced me to not to. He’s only the third guy I’ve allowed with no protection. This is on me, I know.

We had sex again. Same thing. Again, still thinking he’s this awesome amazing guy. 

I found out two days ago he has herpes. And I found out about lawsuits that are active against him. One of them is for spreading herpes to multiple women after not disclosing. 

I then was told by his victim that he forced sex upon her, a SIXTEEN year old after feeding her Coke and other drugs.

I’ve been throwing up for the last few days. There’s more extremely vile things about this person I’ve found out.

The worst part? I have to act like nothing happened until I get my herpes test results back. If I have it he will either just pay me off and silence me with a contract OR blame it on me.

 We’ve been fwb for two years. Lately we’ve been hanging out just as purely platonic friends for about a month now.

I thought he could’ve done this because he didn’t want someone going through his phone and seeing that, or even maybe he himself wanted to leave the past in the past, but I can’t help but feel like he unsaved them so his girlfriend wouldn’t see.

1：The image goes ahead of the ability, no one is obliged to read how noble your soul is and how kind your character is through your sloppy image, a woman must present your refinement and beauty.

2：Learning to entertain yourself alone is a necessary lifelong ability. The vast majority of life's long journey is spent playing alone and being alone, so it is important to like yourself and fall in love with yourself.

3：Women who maintain lifelong learning and growth will become more and more temperamental. In addition to learning in school, it is important to maintain daily growth after graduation, and to have a good temperament, it is important to read more and travel more, and make more mentors and friends.

4：Have the ability to support themselves, economic independence, in order to personality independence, independent thinking.

5:Finding a beloved career is more important than finding a beloved boyfriend. Your love for your dreams and your faith in this life is a path to freedom and liberation. When you have a dream and find a beloved track, the more you live, the better you will be.

6：Do not forget work and dreams at any time, because having work and dreams will make you shine in love, a woman who does not shine is also withered in love.

I’m (21m) extremely new to dating (only one date lol) so I apologize if this question seems stupid. About a month ago, my coworker(19f), who I was crushing on, admitted that she liked me. We agreed to not date or anything until she left our job. She left a couple weeks later so I asked her out and planned a date. We went to an arcade (we both love them) and we grabbed a snack to eat and talked in my car for 2 hours. There was no hug or kiss at the end. However, when we talked we openly talked about how much we liked each other while working together and that we think each other is cute, so I know attraction is there.

Today we planned a second date, bowling, for next week after she moves in for school. When planning it I joked that after this we should start to pick less competitive dates since we’re both very competitive. She agree and said that she’ll do some brainstorming.

It obvious that after two dates we should probably do something a little more “serious”. But I was wondering when should our dates go from generic “getting to know each other” dates to being more romantic. I was thinking of a picnic for date 3, but is that too romantic? How exactly should I progress these dates to be more romantic?

He disclosed not having any prior experience with women so that’s a step in the right direction correct? 
-how do we become even closer best friends?
-I would like him to call or text me more but don’t want to come off as needy

In all those years he always tell me to show him my true emotions and not tell him how I feel right away. I recently started to do so and open up. I stated to notice he kept promising me things like date night ideas, actions he will do to show me he loves me, or just by my one flower to show me he loves me. When the time comes to prove to me he always back tracks his promises or just tells me a excuse. Don’t get me wrong he has done a few things like we just recently traveled together (first trip was a with his family and was paid fully from his family and him. The second trip was a family a family with my family and was paid fully by my parents and me), to dinners, and to movies. It seems like he really tries to place the effort in but always ends up not showing up to his full promise. What I’m honestly getting tired is the empty promises he gives me. Like today we were going to the movies for the first time since COVID. I worked a 9 hour shift while he just attended a 2 hour a doctors appointment. After I got off work he still wanted me to pick him up and drive to the movie and to diner. Keep in mind I didn’t have a pair of extra clothes( I’m a RN so I wear these ugly navy scrubs), my low tire pressure light was on, and he promised he would drive and I would help him pay for the movie plus dinner. Well when I called him he said it rained and does not want to drive and he prefers for me to drive and pick him up. I tired go meet him in the middle asking him to drive fo my house and I will drive to the movies but he said no. He kept telling me that driving in the rain is super dangerous but keep in mind it was honestly sprinkling. He told me that nothing will change his mind.

Second date, the following day, he invites me for dinner at his house. Wealthy, successful, definitely trying to show off. He makes a lovely dinner and we make out and get to 3rd base.

Personally, I'm looking for something more serious. I'm not expecting an immediate relationship but if it's not going in that direction, I'm bailing. I want to call it off because we are looking for different things. Do you think he's after something casual, or just taking it slow? I know I should just ask, but I already did, and I'm not sure what 'just dating' is meant to mean? Just dating until he finds someone he feels strongly about? Strictly just dating to have casual sex? I'm wary if he IS only looking for something casual, he'll carefully say whatever he needs to to get me to have sex with him.

If not, TL;DR at the bottom.

I've liked a girl ever since we met 8 years ago in college. She was an international Chinese student and I'd just gone through a bad long-distance breakup. It was hard for either of us to really start something, given our meticulous/analytical/logical personalities had already seen the end before we could start anything. Her with being able to stay in America for visa reasons; myself with starting a rigorous career &amp; possibly moving out to Korea in the future.

I always thought...2 more years, then I'll be in Korea. My plan delayed by like...basically 8 years now, each time thinking I'd go back in 2 years, only to find good opportunities if I stayed in America. So I did. But she went off to China for a few years. And then graduate school in New York (myself in LA). Then currently a job on the east coast (myself still in LA). I imagined one day getting married to her but I never knew how long I'd have to wait or how it'd pan out, if ever.

Everything changed in Nov 2020. During an annual health exam, my dad found out that something was growing inside of him. I questioned my very existence, having lived apart from him for 15+ years given his sacrifice to work alone in Korea to support us financially. Luckily they removed the tumor and he's healthy, but I know I definitely still want to spend more time with my parents in Korea while I can. So I want to move back and now it's probably a matter of when, not if. Today my decisions are based on whether I would regret something in the long-term or not. People often regret the things they don't do rather than the things they do.

So when she visited a friend in May, I finally told her how I felt. She mentioned she also liked me as she was crying happy tears. It was a beautiful moment and she told me she would cancel her plans to spend quality time with me during her week-long trip.

But we didn't spend that time together. Later that week, we met because she wanted to have a mature discussion about how she cancelled because she didn't want emotional attachment because she knew I would one day move. She'd been in long distance relationships before and hates them. I have no clue when I'll move, if ever, because my life is so up in the air right now.

She mentioned that if she found out how I felt earlier, she would've gone out with me because she was ""young and stupid"" (which I don't believe; we haven't changed much; she's smart as hell).

I have regrets that I didn't tell her my feelings earlier, so I finally told her how I felt this past May, and here we are again...seeing the end before anything starts. It's a desperate feeling I've felt so often. I told her I respect her thoughts &amp; feelings and that I support her. That I just wanted her to be happy, no matter where we ended up in life. And that I understood her completely. I meant all of that.

Fast forward and we're still great friends, catching up every now and then. I ask if she wants to travel somewhere together over Labor Day Weekend and she says yes. Then a few days later...again...she cancels on me. Same idea--emotional attachment. She's afraid of emotional attachment and afraid that she wouldn't be able to control her emotions when she's with me and that things might get complicated between us which we don't want because we both value the friendship so much. Same thing on my side...I told her what I'd told her before (totally understand; support her; etc). And I also mentioned that I'm not the type to persuade people, because I believe people should do what they want to do, rather than get persuaded, and that I'm not the type to want to impose. She also tends to be an emotional people-pleaser type so I especially want to empower her to make her own decisions to get what she wants for herself to make herself happy.

So here I am. I'm honestly heartbroken. And I don't know how to feel. I feel like our fear is driving us to make such rational, minimal-risk decisions. It seems so simple...we both like each other. And I can't get past the feeling that I might regret this in the future if we don't let things just play out naturally. But also that we might regret it if we do get emotional attachment and I do in fact leave. I so badly want to spend more time with her while I can but I don't want to persuade her. Or should I? I've no clue what's right. 

It'd be great to get some feedback to see from y'all how absolutely batshit crazy / emotional / stupid I sound right now, and maybe put some perspective on all this? And whether I should actually say something to her, that I feel like maybe we should give it a try before we go off our separate ways? And what to say, if anything?

IDK. Very confused. Thank y'all so much for hearing me out. For real.

TL;DR Moving out of country possibly soon (months? years?). Liked a girl since 8 years ago. Finally told her 3 months ago and she told me she liked me back. She doesn't want to meet because she has a fear she can't control her emotions and she'll develop emotional attachment for me even though I'm likely leaving. I understand &amp; respect her &amp; her thoughts completely. Not sure how to feel. Not sure whether I should persuade her to take risks so we both don't regret like we both do about our relationship's past.

During her class I didn’t realize I kept staring at her even when I tried looking away, I kept getting butterflies anytime she walked by and this huge smile would be made on my face. I didn’t realize I felt attraction mainly because I’m not interested in relationships. 

She later confronted me and she told me she can’t see her students that way but she did ask me if I was planning on asking or pursuing after I graduated to go somewhere else. I never gave her a straight answer, I honestly never thought of it at that point. 

I later told her I found her attractive but that I was a little uncomfortable seeing my professor that way too. I started to visibly walk away from her every time I saw her when I noticed my own feelings.

I am a 30-year-old man who never had any problem finding dates. I am not super attractive but good looking, funny but a little nerdy.

To be honest, I always tried to date women that seem attractive to me on a superficial as well as a personality-based level. In some cases - especially with online dating however - you end up with someone that doesnt look like the person from the pictures anymore and in other cases I ignored superficial aspects because I really liked their personalities / humour.

Unfortuantely, I am a superficial asshole and I cannot really move on someone I dont find attractive in a superficial way. But I often found that these women were so much nicer, more chilled and more proactive when it came to dating and just banter / conversations. 

And the hottest women generally seemed to be super passive and even annoyed when there is e.g. a match on Tinder. Probably because they are overwhelmed by too many chats. 

So if you are ever having to decide between looks and personality - take the damn personality.

Usually I'm not a great texter, but talking to them was just a joy and we'd end up talking far too late into the night most evenings over the next couple of months. We did some Zoom-type dates as well and those were great as well - we managed to talk for hours at a time without it getting awkward or anything. At a time when lockdown was pretty shitty, talking to them really gave me something positive. We talked a lot about how great it would be to actually meet up and do things in person when things were better.

Unfortunately for reasons that I won't get into they were finding lockdown tougher than most, and around March they said that they needed to take a step back as they weren't in the right headspace for dating, but that they'd love to perhaps pick things up in the future. I told them I completely understood, and that I'd definitely be keen to try things again in the future.

We haven't had any contact since, but I keep finding myself thinking about them. I've tried a bit of the dating app stuff since, but haven't found any sort of similar connection. My instinct over these months has always been not to try and reinitiate content as they were the one who broke things off and I don't want to put them under any sort of pressure.

what id like to know beforehand is though, am i normal to be worked up by it? (i DO have codependent tendancies) and seen from afar is this just another unfortunate case of monkey branching with me as the branch caught in the middle?

if i may go in detail about my current situation: met a girl on a dating app, the 2nd date turns amazing and long into the night, so i ask her for a kiss and thats when she confesses to me that she just got out of a relationship last month and that shes still friends with her ex and that shes open to kissing me but wants to take it slow first. so we didnt kiss. i met her again the next day and since the act of monkey branching was heavy on my mind i was mentally guarded up to which she said later on text (after cutting that date short) that our chemistry was off. 

how do i deal with something like this? 

i admit i have a messy past myself but at least this time i was conscious to let my emotions clear by allowing about 3 months of mourning after my last breakup before getting back on the dating scene.

I ended up leaving that job snd asked my female friend if she could get her Instagram for me, and I sort of just threw that out there but surprisingly my female friend did it. The girl said she would follow my friend so that I could get her Instagram and it never really happened until recently, so I just found her on Instagram anyways and followed her, but she never followed me back so I thought was that.

I end up getting called to this job again, I see this girl and we’re cordial, but I just felt super awkward bc I thought I got rejected. Well my female friend told me that they were talking about me and she said I was cool and funny, and even asked my age. Today I saw them and my female friend said the girl felt weird bc I didn’t say hi to her, but I didn’t mean to I was just nervous and didn’t want to like look at her again if that makes sense.

She comes up to me during my shift today and says that she didn’t mean to ignore my request (she told me she doesn’t check her requests that often) and that she followed me back. She then started trying to make small talk but I was just sort of mumbling and was too anxious, but managed to tell respond to her questions, and she just asked me when I was working again and I told her tomorrow, and she said that she would see me tomorrow. 

I just feel so dumb for acting like a shy little kid but I just couldn’t help it bc in my head I though she just ignored me, and I thought she wasn’t interested and I’m not sure if she’s just being nice now. I hate awkward situations like this and I felt my flight or fight response kicking in and I usually don’t get nervous taking to girls, but when I have a crush I turn into a second grader. 

That’s what I’m most embarrassed about like why do I have to be such a dork, and I don’t like how I reacted like i was so nervous that I realized that I didn’t realize I hadn’t said hi. And my female friend is the one who told her that she didn’t follow me back so I just feel like such a wuss for some reason. I’m trying to not let it get to me, but I hate that I made it so awkward.  

I was wondering if I should just leave it at that or what I should do? I feel like it’s too awkward for me now but at least I know I’m not repulsive and she didn’t mean to do that. On one hand her coming up to me and saying that made me feel good but I just don’t want to make things any more awkward. She didn’t seem to flustered or anything, but I just get this way with girls who I thought rejected me.

I'm a bit concerned cuz i have seen few incidents on how violent women react to love proposal &amp; i like a girl in singing club i am worried how she may react 

I tried few dating apps(6-7) no one uses them here in my town(people use dating apps mostly in metropolitan cities because they are far from parents/relatives doing a job &amp; people in cities are a bit modern)

Case-1:

In my school my best friend used to put a big bar chocolate in her crush bag for few days then one day he put both chocolate &amp; letter then got surrounded by her &amp; her friends then one girl pushed him down &amp; warned him for few minutes &amp; also verbally said some nasty things (he is top 3 muscular guy in our class won many wrestling matches he could have taken them all down but gentlemen never hurts women)

Case -2:
Other friend had a crush one a girl one year younger than him. We like idiots forced him to confess his feelings to her. He confessed to her in front of us ""he said: i like you &amp; i want to be spend most of my time with you "" she said: i am not interested, then we went to our class

 Few minutes later she complained to school management &amp; PT sir just bashed us all

Conclusion:
I'm not telling that all girls are same cuz there were few love couples in our school &amp; college l &amp; I'm not blaming those girl who reacted immature they were raised to reject love proposals that way by there parents 

My rant over Indian mindset (You may skip below part)

India population more than 1.3 billion, love before marriage is looked down &amp; they suspect the character of women, parents are worried that her daughter may not be married in future &amp; many men want to marry a virgin, rejects if she had any relationship in past.
.Taking about sex is taboo, PDA is not tolerated , mostly no one knows kamasutra exists, Indians are obsessed with arranged marriage.(no strip clubs etc)

If you watch Indian movies 99% are love stories why cuz its fictional to us just like harry potter &amp; avengers to you love stories are like a fantasy to us.

My personal:

My school is not religious still we were advised to call opposite gender as brother &amp; sister 

My Junior college had separate classrooms for both genders

I'm using an alt-account to post this anonymously since some of my friends browse reddit and this is too personal even for their eyes, but I desperately need to vent since my therapist will get back from vacation in September.

I am a 30 years old heterosexual male and I've never had a romantic relationship with a woman during my whole life. I've had very few dates over the years with no success and only one ""sexual adventure"" that I will always remember as the worst period of my life so far.

Despite this, I've been told many times by people across the gender spectrum that I am fairly good looking and pleasant to be with. I have lots of friends from every gender and sexual orientation and they all seem to agree on the fact that there's nothing inherently wrong with me both in looks and personality. However, as the title says, when it comes to exploring and building sentimental relationships with women, I systematically enter into this destructive spiral of self-doubt that leads me to think that nobody can possibly find me attractive. The result of this delusion is that, out of fear of failure, I always tend to boycott any interaction where romance is at stake.

For some context, I'll give you a recent example.

Due to both the pandemic and personal reasons, I couldn't plan any vacation this summer, so I decided to take a few days off from work to go back to my native town to just relax with family and friends who happened to be there.

Among the friends that I've met there was this girl that I've known for about 25 years. The thing is... We haven't seen each other during the past 18, with the exception of a school reunion about 10 years ago. We were close friends back in the day: we were in the same classroom at elementary school and we also spent a lot of time together after school. We played, studied and generally goofed around as children usually do.

So, naturally, being a bit nostalgic I decided to text her asking if she was in town and if she wanted to catch up after all those years. Her answer was extremely positive and we decided to grab something to drink. Just to be clear: I didn't want it to be a date, I just wanted to meet alone with her and talk freely about our lives and all the things that happened to us over the years.

The night went well. We first grabbed a few drinks at a bar, then had dinner at a restaurant (which was a decision taken on the spot since we didn't have plans to eat together); all while talking non-stop. After dinner we joined a few friends at another bar where we stayed until late.

The more she talked, the more I wanted to hear. Everything she said was interesting to me. My eyes were glued to her face and, as the night went on, I gradually realized how pretty she is and how I loved the outfit she chose. That is not to say that she was the only one doing the talking, she also seemed interested in my stories, my opinions and my current life. It definitely wasn't a one-way conversation. At the end of the night we left each other with the promise of meeting again in the future in case any of us happened to pass by the town where the other lives. She mentioned that she could even come visit me in about a month with the occasion of the birthday of a girl friend of hers who lives in my town.

And here's the issue: on one hand I would like to meet her again, text her and explore a new relationship, but on the other hand I'm completely paralyzed by thoughts such as ""Your feelings are just coming from nostalgia"", ""She can't possibly like you"", ""Don't text her, you'll just end up being annoying"", ""You don't really like her, you just want to be desired"", ""She must have so much more than you going on in her life, she can't waste time with you"", ""You shouldn't try to meet her in September, you'll just end up more miserable. Just forget her and move on"".

I don't know what to do. I don't want to miss on the opportunity to have her back in my life, even as a friend, but at the same time I'm too afraid of knowing what could happen if I continue to interact with her. I'm sure that I'll take any negative feedback as a judgment on my person and not just her personal preference.

I'm aware that this is an extremely arrogant and egotistical approach, because I completely erase the ""other"" from the relationship and make everything about me, as if they don't have to have opinions or tastes. Nevertheless, it is extremely hard for me to fight this mindset. As I mentioned before, this happens to me every time I am emotionally invested in a relationship. I am tired of it. I am both mentally and physically exhausted: during the day I am haunted by these obsessive thoughts, during the night I tend to dream of better presents that make waking up in the morning all the more difficult.

This time around, we went on a date, and honestly it was one of the best dates I've ever been on, and I've never felt so comfortable with someone I've spent so little time with, but low and behold, it's been over 6 weeks and I've had less texts from him than fingers on my hands.

I’m a 29F and feel more and more like life is passing me by...

I have a good job and have studied for several years to get here (intense and long hours). I have a good circle of friends and have travelled throughout my 20s. I have also had a good few dates over the years and do get attention/have had people want to be in a relationship with me but have never felt the spark back. The guys who I have liked, it has either been the wrong time or the wrong guy. I slept with a guy a couple of years ago for the first time and it was quite traumatic, he took it quite badly that I was inexperienced and it basically ruined things. Then the next time I met someone else and tried to get there, I was super anxious and couldn’t “perform on demand” and get in the mood which again killed it.

In my spare time I’m trying to get closer to pleasuring myself on my own (I think there are mental blocks there) and also trying to think of myself as a sexual being. I have huge body image issues which has stopped me from dating as much as I wanted which I am working through and trying to get fitter.

Anyway it suddenly struck me that I’m not far off being 30 and have never had a boyfriend/serious relationship, don’t know what works for me sexually (I’m working on this) and also working on body confidence by getting toned etc.

I’m quite chatty and enthusiastic, and have really good close friends, so don’t have trouble getting close to people. I just wish I could wind the clock back ten years lol. For some reason in my mid 20s I didn’t think this was all that weird but now it’s been intensified.

Please help!!!!!

My plan is to use the next few months to get hotter basically for my confidence while also working out what works for me sexually. Then start dating again as my confidence increases. I don’t think my self esteem is there right now.

And at the time I sort of didn’t know what to say. Anyways that was just me talking to her on the phone for a few days and she didn’t know what I looked like.

We met and I still couldn’t tell. I thought maybe she liked me but then as time passed I thought perhaps I was wrong or perhaps she didn’t like my appearance. It just died after a couple months…I’m not too sure why but I accepted it and moved on. And even now I’m wondering maybe there was nothing there or maybe she wanted me to ask her out and when I never did she lost interest

Then out of the blue a year later of no contact she messages me today. She brings up an old joke and her nickname for me. We speak for an hour over text. She said at the end she was thinking of me and missed me. She’s saying ‘that’s sweet’ and occasionally like ‘haha don’t worry bb’. 

Disclaimer I’m very much out of my element with this. I literally have never dated anyone and I’m fine with that I just go to the gym and do my own thing in life for now until someone comes into it. But I also am happy to date her because I think we really get on.

Last girl rejected me, but at first thought I just wanted to hang out and go on a hike. Girl before that went on a hike with me and I realized we were not compatible so I told her how I felt and she said that she didnt know what ""this was"" anyways..   


So maybe saying ""want to hangout"" works when picking up random strangers, but for someone I've talked to several times and worked up the nerve to ask out, it does not seem to work or get the message across of my intentions.   


Even saying ""want to check out \_\_\_\_\_ with me"" seems to go right over peoples head. 

So to me it seems better to be make it obvious so at least there isnt confusion and you can get the rejection earlier rather then ""hanging out""  hoping for something that they dont want.

I’m going to try and keep things as organized as possible because there are a lot of different parts. I (25F) started seeing “Joe” (30M) a little over two months ago. At the beginning Joe told me that he and his ex lived together but that she was moving out when the lease was over (end of this mont). At this point they have been broken up for almost a year. I have lived with an ex so I am sympathetic to the struggles that come along with it. 

We have had to navigate her being home to hang out (which has been annoying but I dealt with it). 

Up to this point everything has been great. I feel secure and happy with him and I’m excited to see where things go. 

However last night things exploded. Again, this is all his side of the story. But she came into his room and picked a fight about something stupid. And she got violent. She was throwing shit at him, screaming etc. When he showed up at my house there were scratches all up and down his arms and his finger was severely bruised ( I’m thinking a fracture or sprain). And no I don’t believe he started it. He did say he pushed her back at one point to get her to stop. 

He was planning on coming to my house last night anyways but came later than expected. When he finally came he sat outside for ~30 minutes talking to his dad about what happened. 

When he finally came in he told me everything that happened. And truthfully I didn’t know what to say or feel. She has kinda always been a looming presence that neither of us talk about. It was very clear that I was upset and uncomfortable and he apologized.He asked me if I wanted to talk about it more but I really didn’t know what to say. 

He’s leaving on vacation and then I go on vacation so I won’t see him for ~two weeks. 

My question is: 1. Is this something that I should consider ending this over? 2. How do I find the way to express how I feel about the situation (I feel overwhelmed by a lot of emotions) 3.

So I (27F) recently reconnected with a guy (29M) after not talking for about two months. Nothing “bad” happened, we just decided to go our separate ways. Anyways, we hung out this past weekend and had sex for the entire afternoon. It was great, and it was nice seeing him again. Our sex has always been pretty freaky and rough. I’m talking biting, hair pulling, choking, slapping, all of that. We have great sexual chemistry, so I have no complaints in that department. 

So we hung out again last night, and things got weird. We’re laying on his couch and I get on top of him. We’re just talking and kind of casually kissing. I want to stress that we are both dressed at this point, nothing sexual is happening. I make a joke about another guy, and he grabs me by the throat with both of his hands. Very forcefully. I immediately pull his hands off of me and tell him he can’t touch me like that. He immediately apologizes and says that as he was doing it, he realizes he was being too rough. I kind of just sit there uncomfortably and he asks if I wanna leave bc he would never want to do something that made me uncomfortable. I say no I’m okay, and sit there for maybe five more minutes before I decide I feel weird and want to leave. At this point he shuts down completely and he silently walks me to my car. No hug or kiss goodbye. I can tell something is off. Maybe within five minutes of me leaving, he texts me saying that he thinks we’re “out of gas but he enjoyed spending time with me”. I “like” his message but I don’t respond. I haven’t heard from him at all since. 

I feel very weird. I’m sad but also embarrassed. A part of me feels like I’m overreacting because I’m okay with being choked in a sexual setting so maybe I gave him the wrong idea? There’s a small amount of guilt that I maybe gave him the green light on this type of behavior. Then the other part of me knows I’m in the right and I shouldn’t be sad about being dumped by a guy like that. I set a boundary and he didn’t like it, so he removed himself from the situation. I’m trying not to take it too personally. In the end, I’m proud of myself for actually sticking up for myself. 

I’m not sure what this post is. I’m too embarrassed to tell my friends and family about it, so I guess I’m looking for some support from internet strangers.

It's really weird/creepy when you go out with someone after a few dates and then all the sudden you are their everything, apart from their job. I seem to be a magnet for those who have no friends/bad friends and no life apart from work. And too often they spend our dates/time togehter complaining about their work/job/family, and never have much to say about what they have done/are doing with their life. 

I wonder what it is that these people are seeking that I have? I'm really independent, have my shit together, etc. is that what it is? I also have strong boundaries and limits on what goes on early in a relationship. I don't want to see someone more than 1/2 time a week at most, because I need time for other things and honestly I'm never day-dreaming/thinking of etc the other person really apart from the actual dates. 

It's really turned me of from dating. The past few years it's like I'm candy for these types of people, and of course when I break up with them there is the drama. They sometimes harass me or show up at my place thinking I'll take them back. Or they just throw a tantrum/fit of tears and agony and insults after like we've been dating a few weeks at most. It's too much and it's really taxing/depressing to deal with people who react this way, to the point it basically turns me off dating for months at a time now. I am a grown adult, the only tantrums/drama I should be tolerating are from children, not 30 something grown ups.

I just want to date someone who has a normal healthy view on life for once. It's like, I'd like to meet someone, but not sure I can afford the toll of wading through emotionally dysfunctional people again and again. The last woman I went out with was red flagging it on date one, and then sent me dozens of begging texts asking to go out again to the point I blocked her and was scared she'd stalk me.

1) Normal looking woman who is lean and fit with a BMI of 20. She says ""I go to the gym every day for an hour, do intermittent fasting, and avoid junk food. I don't smoke or drink. Health and fitness are important to me.""

2) Normal man who is lean and fit with a BMI of 22. He says: ""I go to the gym every day for an hour, do intermittent fasting, and avoid junk food. I don't smoke or drink. Health and fitness are important to me.""

The woman will get THOUSANDS of likes from men complimenting her on what great shape she's in and how she takes such good care of herself. Many will ask her what she does at the gym or other questions about her lifestyle.

But the man won't get the same positive response. In fact this profile will likely hurt him as most women nowadays say they consider it a ""red flag"" if a guy works out regularly or doesn't want to eat a lot of junk food. They commonly say on here they don't want to date someone like that and they would rather someone with a beergut (ie. dadbod, ie. abdominal obesity) instead.

A taller/whiter or better looking guy with a beergut will easily get more matches than the normal fit man, while no type of woman with a beergut will beat the normal fit woman.

People commonly say women date more with a view to long term relationships than men. So why don't women care if a man takes good care of himself or not?

Do women want to get old with a man watching him get diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and other obesity related complications? I really don't understand it. Do people think fitness or lack thereof has no long term health ramifications?

If a woman gave me early indications she had fentanyl or alcohol or food abuse problems I would be worried about a long term relationship with her. I'd worry about what's going to happen to her and if she'll deteriorate. Yet women say they find a guy who works out daily more of a red flag than a guy with a beergut who never exercises and drinks regularly?

America has over 72% adult obesity/overweight rates, and it's supposed to be 88% by 2030. I would think that would make the few normal people who take good care of themselves MORE desirable, to the extent that being fit would automatically put you in the top 10-30%, but this only seems to work for women, and not men.

People tell men to ""hit the gym"" constantly. But no one tells you that once you do and become fit it will be neutral or negative for getting a date. No one tells you it only works if you're a woman, because most men (but not most women) find that desirable.
