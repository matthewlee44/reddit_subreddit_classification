I mean Im actually doing good by 1st dates. I lost count. Maybe 5 or 6 dates within two month and a couple girls messaging me.  


Seems like some of them are ghosting me and one said too busy to meet soon, but would exchange number. Another that would probably go on a date if I asked which im about too I think. Just been busy.  


I went on a date today and felt nothing. I went on a date earlier this week that I thought was really good and have a 2nd date scheduled.   


With the success Im getting Im sure I could continue getting a couple dates a months for awhile off these apps. Large city.... Look, I dont understand my luck but all I can say is most dates have gone no where....  


So why delete??  


Becuase girls I relate with just must not be on these apps. The more I date the more I figure out what I want. The girl I went on a date with earlier this week is honestly so cool and If it doesnt work out than again I have changed my mindset on what im looking for and the best way I can think is by actually meeting people IRL.   


I like to bike, hike, boulder, do yoga, indie music, etc. Im also not really a sports person. I'll spare more details, but I'm getting tired of going on dates with people I dont really have that much in common with.   


At least if I focused on meeting people IRL at the climbing gym, yoga class, biking group, maybe even a dancing class I would know we have something in common.  


Maybe I should just be very picky on these apps. I just try acknowledge that sometimes people are not good at writing bios and that if I match and we talk I'll find things we have in common.   


At the same time I have fomo if I do delete the apps. I want to be intentional about dating because in the past I wasnt and went through loong dry spells.   


But If I can force myself to get out more and talk to girls in IRL, maybe I can ditch these apps???

he’s a great guy but lately he’s really been acting cold and different.

he told me when he was drunk that he knows he’s being mean to me and he’s sorry, he assured me it’s not my fault and he’s under a lot of stress. 

in the heat of the moment, i told him to leave me alone and he really took it to heart. he makes me feel things i’ve never felt before.

I’m (F) am in my mid-twenties and have always been rejected after confessing my feelings. 
I started dating for the first time when I was 18 years old, that’s also the age of when I had my first kiss. I was a late bloomer but never really minded that I was. 

Even when things seem to go well with a guy they always turn me down after I confess my feelings. Saying that they would rather be friends. 
I’m personally not a fan of switching back to “being friends” after being romantically involved with someone but some made it work, some didn’t. 

People always say that when someone rejects you it has nothing to do with you. It’s not a personal attack and I’m slowly realizing and coming to terms with that. However, it doesn’t make the rejection less painful. 
I often wonder if maybe I’m not attractive enough or don’t really have enough of a personality for guys to stay interested in me. 
I’m starting to think that maybe there’s indeed something wrong with me and it is my fault that I always get rejected. 

It might be because of the isolation of the pandemic. (I live alone and started working from home during the first lockdown) I feel somewhat lonely. I know that romantic love shouldn’t be the center of my life, and it is not necessarily the center of it but since I hope to one day have a family it’s a little scary to think that I might never be good enough.

I was shaking it pretty good when a lady (who later said she's 27) joined me. She was over 6 feet tall (at least two inches taller than me; I'm 5'10"" and 1/2) and fit and I'm very attracted to physically powerful women. We went to the bar to talk and she hugged me intensely and was touchy-feely in general, running her hands up and down my arms while she looked at them. (I'm fairly well-built.)

She asked me to join her at her friend's apartment to hang out. I was honestly just enjoying her company and her energy and didn't have expectations, but naturally I bid my friend adieu and left the bar holding her hand, and we walked there together. 

Back at the apartment she brought me to a bedroom, where her friend (a heavily inebriated, quiet man) hanged with us for a little while.

She eventually looked at this guy and said something like, ""Would you mind leaving so we can have sex?"" 😯 He did, and we made out... but no sex. I honestly was pretty buzzed and high since we smoked a joint (legal in my state) and I can't recall 100% what happened. We just stopped. I got her number, she kissed me and I left.

I texted her so she had my number and she immediately texted an address. I assumed it was her place and she wanted more privacy. I texted ""Now?"" She sent the address again, with a location description (under a restaurant). My reply was ""OK but when?"" Again, she sent the address, with the city (even though we were in the same city).

I thought this was weird, but I went. I tried to find an entrance, but couldn't. And the restaurant (which was the address she sent) was closed. I texted and called her again but no answer this time.

This is one of the strangest things to happen to me. What was her game plan? Was I almost murdered? Maybe she did want to meet me but couldn't make it and ghosted? Or did I do something to turn her off and she sent me on a wild goose chase to make sure I left? Maybe she's just crazy and there's no logical process in her head?

This has gotten so bad that it's effecting my mood in general. I have grown a sense of hatred for happy couples and the success stories from people that used the same apps that I used.

At that point, i pulled the brakes, dragged myself to a mirror, and looked myself dead into my own eyes. I had to ask myself, ""Is it really worth it? Do you think you are conducting yourself in a manner that will attract people towards you?"" It is of no surprise that I told myself no. It is not anyone's fault for my own burning hatred. This is the toxic behavior that will only perpetuate my current issues.

But he started chasing me since I went back to my home country and also had confessed his deep feelings and connection with me and that he felt bad about how he treated me and he'd now come for me wherever I go. And we kept this long-distance relationship for 7 months by his attempt of keeping in touch with me. And recently I moved to a nearby country of his. He eventually came over. But not totally because of me since he has his sis living here and gonna take care of her baby while staying at hers.



I tried to clarify what relationship this is when we met again. He said he thought I'm no more interested in him since he was the only one who’s tried reaching out all the time. And for having a relationship, he said it's unfair for me since I'm young and would have lots of opportunities to meet other guys. Furthermore, said it'll be uncertain as before since his life is as and also I'm living in another country. Also I asked ""do you take me serious?"" then he replied he wouldn't have done it that keeping in touch for 7months while we haven't seen each other if he didn't have feelings for me, and said “You're about to dump me, can we just enjoy each other’s company at least for a few weeks I'm here?"" So I replied “that won't happen anymore, it sounds like you wanna have fun for a few weeks and it's been almost a year and I've had enough. This ambiguity is giving me a hard time.” Then he said he could see the future of us and if I could so, let's try?(I’m still confused if that makes sense)



After the date, we had sex at mine during the night and morning but he left right after having sex in the morning. He said he needs to cook for his sister cus she doesn't eat if she's alone. Before he left, he asked me if i want to come over to his sister's place the next day so I said yes however he didn't let me know until the day comes and then said, her baby is sick so not a good time for me to come. 



But still there are other confusing signals. He still carries our pictures in his wallet that we took. There are only three pics in his wallet and one is his parents' and another one is me and the rest is me and him together. Also, he has kept learning my mother tongue language for the last 7 months while we were apart. He kept an empty body wash bottle that I used because it smells like me. He asked me for travelling for Christmas together. Asking where I'd like to be settled down and live for good. etc..



It feels more than a casual thing but still, I can't stop feeling like I'm being used for sex and am not a priority at all. I feel like he just came over to take care of his sister and his niece while I'm just being here for his convenience. Especially I felt so since he left right away after the morning sex. I'm just wondering if I really mean anything to him or he's just deceiving me. I'm really getting exhausted from this relationship, wanting to stop but he means so much to me and almost feel like I love him.

Talked for three weeks then saw each other 3 times in a week. We clicked instantly, we both felt something, but we may have overdid it. We both ended up feeling different types of pressure, we both sabotaged it in some way, and even when we talked and basically righted the ship and we were in a good place, I got scared and cut things off in a way there’s probably no going back from. Hit her up once after to ask if she was willing to talk, but no response. 

In the time since, I’ve been dating a lot and the experience has been a springboard to examine my behaviors and approach towards people, such as recognizing that I’m too guarded with emotional intimacy, and I hold back too much on even the simplest nice things after so many relationships where the woman took advantage. 

Now I’ve been seeing this woman for and it’s probably the healthiest “relationship” I’ve been in since high school, even though rn we’re more casual. She’s even been helping me to recognize and overcome my hangups. It’s a really nice thing we have. We say we’re not serious but I think we both recognize we’re inching closer and closer.

I’m worried I could mess up because I’m not over the woman from the summer. Or at least I’m not over the situation in that I just wish I had done things differently. When I’m with the new person, she has my full attention and my thoughts surround her. But as soon as I leave my mind drifts to the previous one, wishing I had the same experience but with her instead. It’s maddening because I know that it’s not even that woman as she was, but an imagined version in my head. But she’s lingering.

I'm 23 and I'm on a project with a guy who is 21 in a group project. I tried not to, but I developed a crush on him. He's such a genuine, kind, passionate, weird, wonderful person. I have my guards up still but I'm actually a lot like him in ways. He's so cute my heart hurts thinking about it. I really want to tell him but I have this secret fear that he will ""be disgusted that a fat girl asked him out"".

 I know that is really just a part of my low self-esteem peaking its head out and that I should just go for it. And if he really is disgusted that a ""fat girl"" asked him out, it speaks more about his character than me. But I KNOW he would never do that because he is such a kind person. 

Besides that, we are working on this group project till December. If he ends up saying no, and then it messes up the energy of the group flow. My work directly mixes with his, so I have to keep speaking with him.

Isn't it?

The girl I am interested in has me all types of confused. Her behavior seems quite inconsistent, making it hard for me to judge her levels of interest in me.

She walks her dog by my house a few times a week. I think she is cute, so one day I approached her and talked to her for a while. She seemed quite nervous, but engaged. She would talk to me, ask questions, etc.

Since then, she has continued to come by and, in fact, has done so more frequently. However, when I approach her she seems aloof. She will turn away from me when we first meet, avoid eye contact, and if somebody else is present, she will focus on them (i.e.. she will focus on my grandparents and sort of ignore my presence).

But, she doesn't run away. She will stick around for a talk if I make the effort. For example, when I ask if she wants me to bring my dog outside so it can play with hers she will usually shrug and say yes. She has also stuck around through some painfully awkward silences (sorry, I do run out of things to say sometimes.)

I have also been looking at my security cameras (a bit creepy, I know, but I need to justify buying them since they never seem to catch any crimes) and realized she sometimes stares at me when I turn my back and looks at my front door inconspicuously when passing by.

I got back, texted her that I had a great time and she looked good today, she said that she had a great time too, after a few more random texts we finally said goodbye.

Fast forward, I started waiting and texted her the next day to fix a time and location of the next date. She told me she had a busy schedule for this week, and explained what she was doing on each day, and said that she would see me after the coming weekend for sure, I agreed and left it that. On Sunday night, I asked her about the plains again only coming to know (after much deliberation) that there is some medical emergency and a plan would not be possible for the next 2 weeks. I thought that's fine, and we continued texting on and off (with me taking most of the initiatives, she is not much of a texter according to her). 

Fast forward, 3 weeks after the first date, I asked her again and we agreed to a day in the coming week, on that particular day she postponed the plan for some ad-hoc reason. Now, I sensed it and asked her to let me know if there is anything that she feels differently about so that our expectations can align. She told me that she would love to go out when she has time to do so and there is genuinely a place that she would like to go and she didn't understand what I meant by feeling things differently, I got confused at that, didn't really understand what it meant, but on her proposal agreed to meet next week sometime. This day finally arrived and low and behold she said she was very sorry and canceled the plan again, at this point, I left all the hopes with this going any further, though I still felt that meeting her again would be good. 

We informally decided to meet at this common college event. I only saw her during the end of the event (didn't reach out earlier as I was tired of taking the initiative by now), she quickly said bye just after the few seconds in the meet and I was taken aback, I was agitated by this and dropped her a text about not making any plans going further (the next morning she made clear to me that she was intoxicated and was rushing home due to the bad experience). However, I was not very convinced and texted that sitting down for a meeting isn't so tough and boils down to priorities, too which she responded that we probably have different expectations and I was way too serious about the thing. She only looked at this as something when she had time and was bored. I ended it at that, told her that in the future if things align reach out, said good luck to her. 

Now comes the things about which I am confused:

1. Isn't asking out someone formal enough to be considered a date? Did I do something wrong here? Will people go on a date even when they have no intention to be serious about anything? How can I avoid this in the future?
2. What does it mean to be too serious about stuff? Is it a lot of expectation to just consider meeting someone a second time or go on a second date or expect them to give you some priority?
3.

It’s just small talk but we had chemistry together (both literally and figuratively lol) and it was just a really easy conversation from the get-go. The vibe was good :)

So, we exchange numbers, and she has been texting me a lot – almost every day initiating conversation. We agreed to go climbing after class one day, and after our night ended she messaged with me a “I had a lot of fun with you” text, and we agreed to meet up again outside of school later this week. And again, she said she’s “looking forward to it” – it doesn’t feel like something you typically say in the context of a platonic friendship.

Even as dense as I am, I think it’s quite likely that she’s interested. For context, she lives outside of my city so she’s even going out of her way to meet me since it’s out of school.

Overall, at this point in time, things are in a sort of undefined limbo where this could be a friendship or it could be a romantic interest, and I’m not sure how to clarify it. 

On one hand, I could ask straight up if she wants to date, but I don’t want to be too forward and potentially over-do it too quickly.
 
Or maybe I could ask it less-directly. As in, asking “are you single?” and see how receptive she is… but I also don’t want to half-ass the issue.

And the last option is to just keep hanging out without really addressing the issue. But she has already initiated most of the time, and since I truly am interested, I feel somewhat obliged to make a move here.

Do people have any thoughts on that - whether the likelihood  of bad/awkward sex, combined with being ""abnormal"" obligates  someone reveal their (lack of) a sexual history.

At the end I went in for a kiss and got the cheek and was told ""I like to wait until it feels natural"".

I few years ago I broke an engagement to a girl I was with for 7 years because she just didn't show me enough passion or affection. Since then I have dated many girls for whom affection is enjoyed much more freely and those early signs translated into every day life with them; from little gestures like stroking my hair while watching a movie, to wild passionate sex.

So I read a lot into the very early signs of how someone treats physical affection and I am very paranoid about falling into a relationship against with someone who is uptight about affection and sex and so on. So I am taking this as a hard red flag, not really worrying about why it is she rejected it but just taking it as a sign things would not progress to a really physical passionate kind of relationship.

So what are your thoughts on geeks and introverts?? And what I mean by geeks is someone who is obsessed with things like Super Heroes, Video Games, and computer stuff.

And just a side note I am actually a geek myself, and I am learning programming and animation to be a game developer with the hopes of starting a studio.

I'm also 6,4, lean body, and I have blue eyes.

I'm basically trying to figure out if I am someone's type or not because it seems like most women like guys who are the complete opposite.

Also I'm going to give out my dating history, so basically I didn't get any crushes until I was about 16 and before I was 16 I did actually date a couple people but rather than me approaching them, they instead approached me and I dated my first girlfriend for about a year and I thought she was cute but then we broke up because she moved away and I didn't have a phone to contact her, and that was in middle school, and then during my sophomore year of high school(which is when I got my first phone btw) Another girl thought I looked hot and one day when I pulled out my phone she actaully took it out of my hand and put in her number and I was like ""Ummm okay then"" and so then we started texting and we both had some of the same interests but then after a month we just outright ghosted eachother and never talked again and broke up, and honestly I think there was multiple reasons for that but I'm not going to go into those though. And then about a year later when I was 16 I just outright decided that I was going to find another girlfriend and so I went onto YouTube for advice and tried to date another girl and boi did I make alot of mistakes trying to find a girlfriend lol. But after some time now I think I now know what I need to do and patients and not being so thirsty is 2 of them.

So yeah, I'm honestly just trying to understand women better and that's partly why I'm posting this. I'm just wondering if anyone would actually date someone just like me.

Also I'm 18 now btw and have officially graduated.

I did actually make a post similar to this one in which I deleted, and someone said that women are looking for a man who is really nice and is a good listener and I am nice most of the time but when I feel disrespected that's when I'm lets just say not so nice, and also I am good at listening most of the time but my brain also sometimes dozes off when random things come to my mind when someone talks to me. An example of that is a time a couple days ago when me and some friends of mine are discussing a game that we are making and one of my friends was discussing something while I was thinking about something else that he said and so therefore he had to repeat the thing that he was talking about after my brain went randomizer mode lol.

So yeah if there is anyone who wants to talk to me and be a potential girlfriend of mine, please let me know in a reply or a message/dm, I will say though since all of you are strangers, I would appreciate it if you gave me some information about who you are and I will do the same after, and please dont lie either because I know that there are alot of trolls out there that would do that. Anyway my type is any kind of hair color, hourglass body type but there may be others that I find attractive too, blue eyes but if you don’t have that color I’m fine with that too but I do find blue the most attractive, long straight hair or long and curly.

So yeah that's technically my type in terms of looks but yeah even if you think you may not be my type feel free to dm me anyways if you want because to be honest I probably have more than one type lol, but I guess those things that I listed are what usually what comes to my mind when I think about girls that I like.

Anyway now I’m gonna go into my type in terms of personality and who the person is.

Loves animals, is a geek like me lol, is funny, is creative, is extremely nice and friendly, has a cute smile.

And just so that everyone knows, you really don’t have to dm me or anything, if no one wants to dm me I am completely fine with that, also I know that I already said this too but for the love of God please don’t lie about who you are if you decide to dm me or something like that, also not only that but if you decide to dm me just tell me information that you are comfortable with knowing that I’m a complete stranger to you for now.

Also my age limit is 18 to 21, I’m not dating anyone over 21 as someone who is 18.

Also

I will say though that I’m really trying to focus more on other things in my life right now but that doesn’t mean that I won’t talk to any girls though. I’ll have time.

But please be sure to follow the rules that I said earlier in this text though if you decide you want to dm me though.
