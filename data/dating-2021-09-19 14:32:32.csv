1,pretdy,1632080209,WIBTA if I breakup with my girlfriend after getting a surgery,"So this whole thing might sound not believable, but basically I who is 14, have had an online girlfriend who is 17 for the past few months. Whenever we first were announced a couple, I had just turned 14 the same month while she was 17. Because of this age gap, I have always felt uncomfortable with the relationship, especially whenever she would make very sexual comments about me and calls me pet names (like ""pet"") whenever other people are also around. Unfortunately, I have been to scared to break up with her because I might hurt her. But at the same time, I don't want to get her in legal trouble once she does turn 18.

Sometimes, she is not online as much, and we do not communicate for about a week or so, and at first I thought it might be because of school or taking a break, but recently she has informed me that she had a surgery, and didn't tell me before because she didn't want to worry me.

I love her and she is very sweet, but  I just can't do it anymore. I want to wait at least a month to separate from her, but I'm still even scared to do that. I know she doesn't deserve this. I don't want to date ever again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pretdy/wibta_if_i_breakup_with_my_girlfriend_after/
2,pretw7,1632080251,Ghosted for the first time,"(sorry if the formatting is garbage I am on mobile)

I (F22) hung out with a guy (M25) I met online about two weeks ago. Prior to us meeting we texted pretty much daily for two months. I'm not very experienced in the world of dating but decided to give it a try as I have made lots of improvements in regards to my mental health and am feeling more comfortable with myself overall. 
We had great conversations and found we had similar outlooks, values and even had similar experiences. We talked about how we felt like we were meant to meet. I expressed how I didn't want to get my hopes up and reassured me he liked me, my personality and the fact we were similar. Needless to say I thought this relationship would go somewhere whether it was romantic (more ideal) or even just platonic (perfectly fine as I enjoyed his personality/company). 
As nervous as I was to meet him, I was still very excited. I felt pretty comfortable with him even during our first meeting given we had been talking for two months already. Once we finally met up being together just felt right to me. After we hung out for a couple hours and had a great time, (texted me and said he had fun, enjoyed my company, I said the same) we texted a couple days after hanging out and he slowly drifted away in those two weeks.
After some days with radio silence, I reached out to talk about where he stood after meeting, hoping we were on the same page. I made it clear I was totally alright with being just friends if it was something he rather do. Communication is something that is very important to me which I had expressed multiple times. I was hoping with this in mind he would be able to tell me how he was feeling. Unfortunately I haven't heard from him and don't think I will. It definitely hurts to say the least but I'm trying to keep my head up. 
I just wish he respected me enough or cared enough to atleast tell me and not completely ghost me. I'm just venting but I'm sure he has his reasons.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/pretw7/ghosted_for_the_first_time/

I met this woman few months ago and we have been dating since. We see each other once a week. Recently things have been going really strong. Great chemistry, great sex, intimacy, open communication, we have shared values about life. I have feelings for her and she also does. We both have been through many experiences, relationships and a divorce and at a stage where we really know what we want from each other. We are really clicking. I am 42 years old and I feel like a teenager these days which is a nice feeling don’t get me wrong. 

I am noticing though that I am becoming a bit obsessed with the fear of loosing her. I know it may be irrational but can’t help it. She hasn’t done anything to make me feel the worry to loose her. I don’t want to rush things and move too serious into a committed relationship and I want to let things evolve naturally and go with the flow. Just take the time to know each other more and for me to see if it just a feeling of crush or something deeper. Is my worry of losing her normal? Am I overreacting? How can I cope with it?

8,prf3s8,1632081128,Are these major red flags?,"Recently I met a guy after our last chat a year or two ago (in a professional context), he invited me for a drink, we had a good time, and we scheduled a next meet up (date?) which took place today - actually he initiated our communication after we exchanged numbers (and quite quickly). 

Today we spent together the whole late afternoon/evening, we had a good time but: 

1) he never offered paying for me (actually once even directly asked for paying separately, other times didn’t even try to stop me from paying - we were at multiple places). Knowing his cultural background (which is slightly similar to mine) I know it’s a norm to pay for the girl. And we both know he’s in a considerably better financial position than me… but still I was thinking that maybe he was testing me so I convinced myself to be ok with that. 


2) When we were going home he left me in the middle of a random street (which was quite dark and empty) in the middle of the evening - my home was less than a mile away and he didn’t even mention walking me home or just something about my safety. The area is not so safe at night, I even mentioned it during our previous drink, so I was quite… disappointed.

Are these major red flags? What’s your opinion? 

We had a good chat so I’m quite sad about these 2 issues but I feel like they could be a source of major trouble?

If he was not interested why would he spend 5 hours with me?

14,prfb3i,1632081762,Wondering if my 4 year relationship should end. (M 24 / M 28),"I've been seeing a guy 3 hours away for going on 4 years and seeing eachother in person usually twice a month since November 2020. The first 7 times we got together he drove entirely to me, I started going his way in late March. Last time we saw eachother was the weekend of 7/31. 

Things have been ""off"" since mid June (he'll hardly ever compliment me anymore, just sporadically will send anything sexual, and most of his initiated conversation to me are snapchats he sends to all his main contacts)
 but then felt completely normal when we were together from 7/3 - 7/7. He has also been taking medication for severe depression for over a year. 

The last weekend in July I drove entirely to him for the first time (170 miles, normally he picks me up halfway) since my birthday is 8/5 and he wasn't available that weekend. Long story short, my car was unsafe to drive home but he had a mental breakdown and threatened to call the police if I didn't leave Sunday night. He later apologized several times though we mutually agreed to have a break after that. Mid August he suggested this weekend (9/18) for getting back together, saying he was booked until then, but he ended up staying in town not doing anything each weekend. Our plans this weekend were moved to next since a female high school friend was supposed to sleepover at his house last night, which also didn't end up happening. 

When I asked him earlier today what our plans were for this next weekend, he offered to pick me up at our usual halfway meeting point Friday night and then drive me back Sunday afternoon, though also said he works Saturday morning and has an online D&amp;D campaign Sunday morning. 

I know he isn't cheating on me since his sole boyfriend in college cheated on him and he's been bullied off of dating apps due to substantial weight gain. I just wasn't expecting him to say we could only see eachother for 1.5 days after being apart for 2 months.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/prfb3i/wondering_if_my_4_year_relationship_should_end_m/

I’ve had a fling or two over the last couple of years but nothing serious. About 5 months ago, I started dating a lovely woman(49). 

We see each othe about once a week or bi-weekly. We have meals or go on outings. Never really run shy of things to talk about. Things have been going rather well. 

So about 5 months in she invited me to her place again, and proceeds to take our relationship to a sexual level. Which is great, she’s hot and has an amazing body… I had been looking forward to it. 

So we’ve had sex a few times now, she expresses how into me she is. I’m actually pretty into her but I feel we lack sexual chemistry. She doesn’t turn me on as much as past lovers have. 

So now i’m in my head about it. I feel like that magic spice of chemistry is missing. I’ve always had pretty sexual lovers in the past and now I feel like i’m missing something here. 

Is it wrong of me to feel we are better suited to be friends than lovers because of the lack of chemistry? 

I’m not really in a rush to settle down, she is the first woman i’ve really gotten to know and date since my last relationship. Am I just out of practice and being insecure about being okay with knowing she may not be the one?

For reference, I’m in college and I’m 19 M

I went on 3 dates last year with the same girl but it ended up not working out. I talked a bit then asked her out from a small group our professor organized that’s how it all started but it was all online and virtual. 

I then took the last year or so to work and improve myself physically and mentally, going to the gym, becoming more confident, dressing better, etc.

Yes I can ask out my lab partners or people in clubs or even maybe the acquaintances I make in my lecture classes but I feel as if those aren’t necessarily the right places to ask someone out and if rejection happens, it’ll be maybe awkward?

I'm typically a very aware and cautious person, yet I worry due to my lack of experience in dating. I'm going on a third date with the same person and he seems nice, smart, and cool. To be honest, he seems more interested than I am and he keeps inviting me to go out. I decided to accept and go with him to the movies this Tuesday. I just want to stay safe as possible. I'm pretty petite and definitely have no body strength to fight someone. I carry pepper spray with me at all times and always update my friends and family where I am/share my location. We live in a pretty big city, he's from out the country and is here for his PhD. He doesn't have a car, while I bring my car everywhere. The last two times I had to drop him off at his apartment and he invited me inside but I declined. I don't drink in general and we have always met in public. He seems like a good person, but I just want to make sure I always take precaution. Is there anything I should watch out for, anything he says that could be a red-flag or behavior wise that could be concerning besides the usual? Is there anything I can ask to see what his intentions are/what type of person he is?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/prgt4w/how_to_stay_safe_dating/
36,prgu27,1632086617,Terrifying experience with a POF blackmailer,"Messaged a girl who looked cute, her profile said she was 22, she looked pretty young but not nothing scary. She messaged me back about an hour later talked back and fourth in messaging mostly about Football. We eventually exchanged numbers, 

This is where it got really scary...she immediately sent me pics...

You know that creepy feeling you get in the pit of your stomach like something isn't right? Well I had that feeling just before even opening these pics and I should have followed it. 

When I opened the pics it was what appeared to be a toddler naked!! I immediately broke out in a cold sweat sick to my stomach terrified at what I has seeing! The person on the other end then says ""Send me one now ;) &lt;3 &lt;3""...

I imminently told them ""I'm not interested at all this is disgusting!"" They replied with ""Then why did you look at my body and accept nude pics of me on your phone??""   

At this point I immediately blocked the phone number only to immediately get a text from another number! ""Excuse me sir are you the man talking to my little daughter?!"" I replied  explaining everything that had happened..they texted me back with..""So you accepted nudes of my underage daughter on your phone?..would you like to work this out or do I have to go to the authority's with this?"" 

At this point I'm more terrified than iv'e ever been in my entire life and as hard as this was to do I actually went ahead and contacted my local Police and told them EVERYTHING. The Officer at the other end of the line could tell I was terrified and I asked if this was gonna hurt me at all. He explained that these scams have been going on and that if I was telling him the truth I had absolutely nothing to worry about...He told me to turn my phone in so they could document what was happening and that I could go ahead and delete any private information but to leave everything from this incident on there.

I turned my phone over to the Police about an hour ago and even though I did nothing wrong I'm still sitting here covered in cold sweat in panics!...I just hope I don't get set up and the Police are trustworthy..I told them I was just so scared it could get turned on me somehow only cause they could see how nervous I was. 

One of the Police said ""You turned it in bud, you called us, if you were guilty you'd be the dumbest sex offender in history hahaha"" then his partner cut in with  ""Yea we see a lot of creeps, you don't strike me as a creep at all..you did the right thing giving us a call""    

This is by far the most terrifying experience iv'e ever had in my life so please BE CAREFUL who you accept pics from on your phone!

45,prhbrm,1632088199,"Super weird dynamic going on between me (F23) and my guy friend (M27), its like there's ton of sexual tension between us but it never gets spoken about?","So there's this weird dynamic going on between me and my friend that I'm not sure how to handle.

I've known him for 2 years since we are in college and last fall we got closer, socializing more and more through social media during distance mode.

This Summer in June, he asked me out for lunch. I couldn't attend but was quick to reschedule. We went out and played golf instead which was fun. I also got to meet his friend and they were nice.

A couple of weeks later we went out for drinks to play pool. Also had fun.

Some days later I went for a walk and messaged him if he wanted to go for a walk. He responded super fast and was like sure. And then we walked until I had to pee and he was like you can pee at my place I live nearby, so went to his place to pee lmao 

I had to travel out of town and he also traveled out of town but we stayed in touch the whole weekend. I was snapchatting him, and he answered kind of in the same vein. If I sent a selfie with some text, he sent a selfie with almost the same text. Was kind of funny. We have then been out for drinks and playing pool again. And through our Snapchat conversation, I've kinda hinted that he is a guy with good looks and that he is smart. I jokingly call him ""the hunk"" sometimes. Last month he sent me a couple of selfies asking me which ones to use for his social media and I said I'm really bad at choosing stuff like that and that he should maybe ask another female friend to get a better judgement and he was like ""nope asking you, you're the only one I feel comfortable asking""

He also works part time at a bar nearby where I live, and once I asked him what he was up to late friday night through text and he answered saying he was at the bar having a couple of drinks. And then he was like out of the blue asking are you coming? Which sadly I couldn't attend.

However here is the deal. I've been on several dates this summer with two different guys that didn't lead to anything, and he knows about it since we've talked about it. Strangely he never brings up his dating life like I do. He never speaks about other specific women in conversations with me. I don't even know what his type is. I was complaining about this guy rejecting my date proposal and he was like ""you should ask him to go out for drinks and play pool"" with a laughing smiley. We've talked about Tinder and how it sucks for dating and he was like ""you have a better personality than most women on Tinder"" when I was telling him that maybe I have a bad/weird personality and thats why I struggle with dating.

Honestly I don't really know what this friendship is about. I feel like there's a weird dynamic going on here, its bordering between friendship and something more. But then I feel like if he wanted more than friendship he would have made that known by now, by asking me out on a proper date or inviting him over to his place. None of the outings we have been on have been said to be a date. Maybe he feels lonely and haven't been dating for a while and I just happened to be the closest woman at the time.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/prhbrm/super_weird_dynamic_going_on_between_me_f23_and/
46,prhhef,1632088714,Is it Covid or is this just the current state of Dating/Meeting/Connecting IRL from a Digital kick off,"I'm not someone who carries on digitally with someone I don't actually know or yet to have met. A few pictures a blurb or so doesn't tell me if I'll connect. For me meeting someone is the only way to tell if there's connection because you get the full effect of someone - mannerisms, personality and energy - and then determining if both want to pursue getting to know one another deeper, whatever that is or may be. I don't rush anything or go in with high expectations especially when meeting online/apps; just open with a level of genuine curiosity. 

After having built a connection, then texting and messaging makes more sense to me because I have an idea of who the person is and their cadence or context in how/what they write; I rather not have a very long winded back and forth because personally, I can't decipher vibe nor spark without having met and spent some time talking - only commonality and initial interest is what I can glean via messaging someone new. That's a baseline.

It's the in person conversations that are great when they go off on tangents in depth and there's real dialogue with someone you're into, so that you can create anticipation for what may be... but, there's got to be a level of deep interaction, picking up on conversational cues to delve into things to truly understand someone. This doesn't happen with basic small talk type of conversations... you know work, travel and going out drinking etc aren't topics that tell you anything about someone on their own. Everyone likes travel. Everyone likes going out somewhere nice ordering a few drinks and hanging out with friends. Work can be a layered conversational piece but only to an extent. Other things to discuss where someone says something different is usually a pivot point in a conversation that can evolve and tell you a lot about someone, a simple ok and brushing past like some factoid doesn't carry onward a conversation. It just shows a  lack of interest and so doesn't make the other person bother trying to continue to navigate a conversational piece that would allow you to get insight into them. So, it devolves to shallow chatter at a point, initial interest feigns. Maybe it's Covid throwing us off our respective game and we've lost our social skills.

Idk maybe it's just me, pretty faces are everywhere they're no rarity but past that what's between their ears is intriguing... it's what you get to when you show initial interest and have that time together to talk... however you manage to get to that point, if you do. Lately I feel like everyone's conversational skills are limited. I give what I get, I can only dive into things if you're interested in it.

Dialogue takes enthusiasm and interest from both parties otherwise it is just benign small talk. Been having far too much of that lately, some online then some of those IRL.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/prhhef/is_it_covid_or_is_this_just_the_current_state_of/

We went out Friday night and had a really really good time. We were supposed to just get dinner and go mini golfing but it turned into us doing quite a bit more. The conversation was flowing super easy, and nothing seemed forced or awkward, even from the time I picked her up it was like we’ve know each other for a while. Before I dropped her off we made loose plans to do something the next day as well. When the next day came around and I asked if she still wanted to hangout she then told me she just found out she had plans for the rest of the weekend cause her brother was in town. I then asked if she wanted to if she could go out during the week and she said she had work all week and her only day off and already had plans that day. Next weekend I’m out of town so it will be almost a week and half between times hanging out. Side note, when we text she responds and doesn’t really use any punctuation which to me comes off as not interested and if it gets to the end of the convo we were having she just doesn’t respond instead of starting a new convo. So with all that in mind what can I do to continue to show I’m interested and want to go out again without texting he everyday or being over the top, but also not come off as not interested by not texting her at all either?

This is the time of social networks. We can reach more people in a quicker way. Lots of people mostly meet through internet, or dating apps. 

Nothing wrong with that. But I think we lost the “approach strangers” culture. In my country, for example, it’s considered very creepy, no matter what the guy looks like ( well… if the guy looks like Johnny Depp, there might be some exceptions ).

I don’t even get how total strangers might meet out of blue. I’ve never seen a guy approaching a girl in my entire life.

You may ask: Why don’t you try to get socials/dating apps?

Simply, i used to have instagram, but having 15 followers didn’t help in order to attract new people ( especially girls ). 

Dating apps? I hear about some lucky guys who meet interested girls. Never seen them. I’m not even bad looking imo. I’m tall ( 6’3 ) and pretty fit. My face doesn’t make me any favors.

Any good ways to meet/get to know girls?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/privz8/if_you_dont_have_socials_its_the_worst_era_for/
68,prix4l,1632093839,Should I just ghost or confront him?,"I have been dating this guy for almost a year on and off. This summer we rekindled dating after 3 months of no contact. I stayed at his lake house for 5 days, which was great even after 3 months of no contact, there was not a bit of difficulty in communication or anything else. 
He was the one who brought up the issues about our last fight and told me about his one night stands during our no contact period. And told me that he only wanted to be with me.

After I came back to the city we messaged everyday, our talks were great and suddenly it stopped. Then he called me after several days, I missed his call called him back and he didn’t pick up. Then I messaged him and he was very distant, then after few hours he became very open, told me that he was depressed and we talked until like 4 am.

Now the strange part about this is that at the moment when we messaged and he was distant he was at our mutual friend’s house with his friends. They had some disagreement about which I found out through my mutual friend’s friend. The situation is very blurry, but the thing that my friend’s friend told me was that the guy that I am dating mockingly mentioned me and said that he fucked me. They were drunk as I know.

After that day I talked with him and again he was very distant. Only after that I found out about this situation.

Now we are not talking, I don’t think that he knows that I know about the situation and I don’t know if I should confront him about the stuff that he said to get to the bottom of things or just ignore and forget about him? As the situation is a bit blurry I don’t know exactly what to do. 

If I confront him, how should I approach him about this?

Is he trying to distance himself from commitment or is he downplaying his feelings or is he just a jerk, who just isn’t taking this relationship seriously?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/prix4l/should_i_just_ghost_or_confront_him/
69,priyfr,1632093977,How does one even approach someone in public with the intent to ask them out?,"Hi all! I'm not new to the dating scene with me having 3 girlfriends prior. I met them all as I went to nerdy conventions as that is usually where my interests lie. As such it wasn't tough to ask people out in those scenes as it was easy to strike up a conversation and break the ice due to the event being very chill and easy to talk about whether it be because we were in the same line, wearing a cosplay of the same series, or just generally showing interest in what event they were also attending.

However, with it being Covid, this hasn't been possible. No conventions run anymore around here for obvious reasons and I have gone single for over a year now. I do really want to try to approach women again but I am very unsure how to do so? 

I see girls in public who I may be interested in, even having nerdy interest as I may see them in a book store reading a manga, or in a video game store looking at game. But I am unsure how to approach them? I am a complete stranger just suddenly bothering them on their outing and may come off as a complete creep.

I mean her home isn't that far its just 30 min. They didn't came. After I broke up with her she texted after 1 month. She apologized so much but of course I didn't accept but I told her we can talk later. After 5 months we talked again on Discord. I feelt good after all. She went a holiday for 2 weeks. Mean while we were talking on instagram. In 2nd week of her holiday I accepted her but after I accepted she said I have to think about it and that made me very angry after all and I told her I can't handle this anymore. She texted me I love you so much have you someone in your life. I said I don't have anyone in my life have you? And she said no I don't. But after 2 days she texted me we can't do this any more our relationship is over. She met someone in holiday and that guy make her happy after this months.

71,prj4ee,1632094594,My boyfriend said he’s too insecure to call me?,"I’ll try to keep this as concise as possible while providing context. TW: brief mention of suicidal behavior &amp; SH

Background: My long-distance boyfriend and I (both college students) have been together for about six years. We met as kids on MovieStarPlanet lol. We’re “nevermets” mostly due to a slight age difference (3 years) and the fact that I wasn’t really allowed to date when we got together, so it was a secret for a long time. But now, we’ve confirmed travel plans for me to stay with him at his mom’s house early next month. I’ve met his mom via video call before, but he’ll finally introduce me to her in person–and his dad at some point during the visit.

So, the situation? I’ve been sinking into a depressive slump recently and he’s just about the only person I want any interaction with when I’m like this. Last night I got to a pretty bad place and we were texting. He asked me what was going on, said he loved me and was ther for me, and sent me a pic of him smiling (this was the extent of what he could do when we were secretly dating because we couldn’t always talk). This used to be enough to cheer me up at least a little before we became public about our relationship, but now it just leaves me feeling more empty.

I’ve talked to him multiple times about the fact that he doesn’t really bother to call me, even though it was something we so rarely had the chance to do for so long. For awhile we were watching movies together weekly on Discord, but we’ve been too busy with school and work lately. Still, we both have moments during the day when we could video chat, but it won’t happen if I don’t ask first. He’s generally been very good to me otherwise, but this hurts my heart so much.

He says he’s insecure because he feels like he’ll bore me since he’s usually just playing video games, which don’t interest me as much. We’re also not great conversationalists. Nevertheless, I often ask to call him, even if I’m just watching him stream a game, and soak in his company. He even knows I hate hanging up. So I don’t understand at what point he’ll feel secure enough to just randomly call me sometimes.

I’m very insecure too, especially when it comes to him, so I try to be understanding and let it go. But last night I went into an even worse episode, hit and cut myself, and heavily considered ODing on pills because the one person I’m closest to doesn’t make an effort to see me or hear my voice, even when he knows I’m at my lowest.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/prj4ee/my_boyfriend_said_hes_too_insecure_to_call_me/

1) Is exchanging phone numbers a good thing to do? I'm only 20 but I'm way out of touch with the social norms of dating. Is this method a bit old fashioned or is there some other way I make an advance?

2) Should I give give it to her directly, or work it in to a conversation somehow? I want her to know I want to start texting her outside of work, but I don't want to seem too keen/creepy?

Been sort of talking to/seeing this guy for probably a month or two now. We get along great, sex is great, have a nice time together, he's expressed lots of interest from the beginning, etc. We haven't had ""the talk"" at all, and I do not expect him to be completely off dating apps or anything because we haven't talked about it. I haven't really been using any of the apps but I do still have my account and check messages once in awhile just because I don't want to get my hopes up/want to keep my options open/etc, the usual online dating bullshit. He was the one to bring it up a couple of weeks ago when he mentioned that he hasn't really been on Tinder much because he ""feels fulfilled"" with what we've had going on. I haven't been on any other dates since I started seeing him but again, I don't necessarily expect him to be doing the same, though it sounds as if that's what he's doing.

Now over the past two or so weeks, he had to go home unexpectedly because he had a bit of a family emergency - everything is okay now, but now that he's back in town he's also dealing with some major work issues that came up so he did warn me he was going to be sort of offline for a bit because he's trying to clear his head with life stuff. 

I totally understand this, and I've been sort of busy myself the past week or two so we haven't talked much. I sent him a text letting him know that I hope everything's going okay, but I left it close-ended so he wouldn't feel like he had to respond (neither of us really love texting). He didn't answer, and I'm wondering when/if it would be appropriate to send him a message and see if he is still interested and really does just need his space.

I don't want to come off as clingy or annoying, I'm more than willing to give him space over the next few weeks if he needs it to take care of life stuff - and if he's still interested, I would be interested in hanging out again in the future if that's something he'd want, too. But I do kind of want to figure out if he's lost interest because I don't want to wait around if I'm going to end up getting a slow ghost. Would sending a text just being upfront about my continued interest and letting him know that I can 100% keep giving him space, I just sort of want to know where he's at in regards to me be okay or would that be annoying to a guy?

94,prkp0b,1632100581,Is there any hope that this guy will ever want to go out with me after he just lost his job,"I had a huge crush on this guy for 2 years, but we were both in serious relationships when we first met (we coincidentally eventually both ended things) and the timing just never seemed right. I’m also actually really shy and quiet, but I’m tall, in shape and usually dress well and get a lot of attention (I think just because I stand out a bit). His friends were also always trying to hit on me and he always seemed really shy and nervous around me. Anyway, he recently moved away - just before I was about to finally ask him out - so two weeks ago, I texted him asking if he’d like to grab coffee sometime. I figured he’s shy, maybe intimidated, I have to make the first move and voila we will finally go out. To my horror, he never replied.

I recently found out from a mutual friend that he actually just lost his job and had to move in with family. That’s why he left suddenly. 

I feel so badly for him, especially because if he did like me (which I was pretty sure he did), I probably just made him feel even worse. I’m trying to move on already. Obviously, he has more important things to worry about, but I haven’t been able to stop thinking about him still and holding onto this hope that eventually things will work out. I liked him so much. And if he actually wasn’t interested and I completely misread the signs - oh well. But I hate that he could actually like me and just feels too ashamed right now to even talk to me. And I’m afraid to bother him again - I don’t want to harass him if he’s not interested or just make things worse. 

To add to my nightmare, I was walking my dog today when I got to an intersection and noticed a vehicle that looked exactly like his. I thought I really need to stop thinking about this guy - of course, it can’t be him. The car waited there and let me walk past. Then I saw it pull over down the street and I realized it was him! He stopped by to grab old mail apparently (we were neighbors). I avoided bumping into him and just went inside like I didn’t notice. 

What are the chances that I just had to be there the moment he decided to stop by after almost 3 weeks? It just made it even more painful. 

If a cute girl was into you, would you just ignore her if you lost everything? Do you think he’ll eventually reach out to me? If he already felt like I was out of his league before, is it really hopeless now?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/prkp0b/is_there_any_hope_that_this_guy_will_ever_want_to/
95,prkssj,1632100990,Since when did people start asking for social media accounts other than phone numbers after connecting through OLD?,"I just made a match on OLD and things were going well when all of the sudden they ask for my Instagram handle. I find this happens more and more and instead of it becoming a possible connection, it just turns into a rando following my account with no communication (sorry watching my insta-stories doesn't count as ""we're still talking""). What's happening here? If you're not interested in actually meeting up ever then why bother?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/prkssj/since_when_did_people_start_asking_for_social/
96,prkwje,1632101401,Should I wait to text this girl back after waiting for her long response?,"So I’m sorta talking to this girl. We’ve been texting for a majority of the time. 

It’ll be 3-4 hours if not more when she responds sometimes. 

She’s busy and so am I so I’m not these crazy “you need to get back to me within the next 10 minutes” people. 

But what’s the protocol for responding when she does get back to me? I’m simply paranoid that if I reply immediately after not hearing back for hours that I’m glued to my phone.

98,prkz18,1632101660,Does anyone else go through “drought” periods on dating apps?,"I’m on Bumble and Hinge, and not too long ago I was at 50+ likes on the former and would have ten active conversations on the latter.

Now any “like” I send on Hinge goes unanswered, and the ONE conversation I had, the guy just stopped responding. 🙃 

And in Bumble (for the first time) I only have about 10 dudes in my beeline constantly, whereas I’ve always had 50+ guys for the few years I’ve used the app. And I’m not getting any matches on Bumble either.

Like basically it’s a literal drought for me rn.  I’m a girl in her mid 20s btw.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/prkz18/does_anyone_else_go_through_drought_periods_on/
