I got her number a few weeks before we were sent home and away from each other. We kept in touch throughout the summer and began dating each other in the Fall. We're from the same state but on opposite sides, so our dating situation was always distanced. Dating was and is new to her, I just started dating just a few year ago myself. We're both 23 years old.
I finished school and she graduates in a year. We've seen each other as many times as possible this year and have told each other that we want to make things official and exclusive. But there are some problems. Her friend group seems to be influencing her in a weird direction that I'm not sure how to respond to. She's been drinking alot lately &amp; hitting me up while drunk. We've both had our share of intoxicated moments with/around each other since we started dating but it's starting to become a major turn off. It's kinda disgusting knowing how much she's been drinking and frankly it's not a good look for someone that I'd like to call my girlfriend. So I've been ignoring the late drunk texts and calls because I'm simply not entertained. Acting like I don't care as much, when i really do. She's also displayed a lack of discipline and some insecurities in other areas as well.
We aren't perfect and I'm certainly not. I'm willing to help her in certain areas and I expect the exact same in return because that's what I think relationships is good for. I've given her some encouragement in the past and I'll continue to because I do care about her. I don't even know if I'm asking for advice, maybe I just want to hear someone else's view before I talk to her about these things. My bro says that when I bring it up to her, I shouldn't have a critical tone of voice but I'm annoyed by her behavior.

I put ""dating"" in quotations because I've never actually been on a date before. 

It's been this constant uphill battle for me to get even just one date. I truly don't know what I'm doing wrong. I won't deny that I feel bitter and frustrated. I feel deeply flawed and defective. I feel worthless and like I'll never be good enough to meet anybody's expectations. Virtually everybody I know has had dates and relationships. I feel like I'm just an ugly duckling and nobody will ever love me. 

Through 4 years of high school, I was rejected by five women I had crushes on. Usually the girls I liked were always after a different guy. In college, no matter which girl I tried talking to, whether on my floor or from my classes, they were always very uninterested and wanted nothing to do with me. Through 4 years of dating apps, I never managed to land any dates. Hardly any matches, pretty much no responses to my messages, I'd end up ghosted or just flat out rejected. I've tried talking to women at bars, clubs, and social events but again, they weren't interested in talking to me and I felt like a damn fool, a pathetic idiot. I've had a few friendships with women, but they were very short lived as I'd end up ghosted without knowing what I did. I used to have pretty high confidence with women but that's all gone. I'm sure it isn't helping my situation. No woman that I can recall has ever approached me or talked to me first. They usually don't even look at me and quickly divert their eyes away from me to avoid any sort of contact. I feel that I'm just gross and disgusting. And then I'll go out with my friend and women approach him like flies, without him having to do anything. It just solidifies my worthlessness and confirms virtually all my insecurities and reassures me that I am truly undatable.

&amp;#x200B;

1st date was pretty good. Not the best or worst 1st date I've ever been on, but I liked her enough to go out with her again. A couple days after the date, I asked her to go out again, she said yes. 

Tried to set something up for that weekend, but she had tickets to fly home and spend Halloween weekend at home (she grew up far away)

So we set something up for the following weekend. We planned to go to the aquarium, and I explained that they sell timed tickets that need to be purchased in advanced. She okay'd it and I got the tickets for an agreed day and time.

Day of she texts me that she's sick and throwing up. I told her it was okay, just feel better, the usual stuff. At first I thought she was lying, but her pattern of behavior over those couple of days and unusual lack of social media activity during that time, texting me pictures (she looked sick) I think she was telling the truth. And if she wasn't, at this point the whole thing was way too elaborate of a way to get out of a date for it to have been worth her while of not wanting to reject me.

So after a couple days when she was feeling better, I asked her if she still wanted to reschedule. She immediately responded ""Definitely!""

But I'm stuck working this whole weekend so we couldn't go out.

Which leaves next weekend, which is 1 whole month apart from the first date. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr:

Pros - She's texting regularly, sending selfies, trying to reschedule, appears to have deleted or disabled her OLD profile.

Cons - 1 month between dates.

Ok, I know the golden rule of not dating coworkers b/c it can really mess things up. But in the context where we both work, we don't have to work together, we just happened to work at the same company. So we have been really friendly towards eachother since we both started working there. We really vibe and just had like that inate chemistry with eachother but this was all at work. Eventually we followed eachother on social media and then got each others numbers and thats where we are today. So about two weeks ago he dm'ed me asking if id like to grab coffee sometime and I said yes, that ended up turning into dinner bc of our schedules. The dinner was great, I wasn't sure if it was a friend date or a date date, but he paid at the end even though I told him I'd split it. We have been texting nonstop throughout the week and again he asked about getting dinner again this weekend so we did and I picked the place, made the reservation so i was totally expecting to pay, got my wallet out but he insisted on paying again. We have ended both dates with hugs, I'm used to more but I love the pace this is going. But I am just wondering whether these are date dates or just friendly hangouts.

We started texting over the summer, and went on 3 great dates. We text everyday, but tonight we finally had the hard talk I had been putting off. 

She was in a 7-year relationship, that ended in January. Her ex was toxic, an alcoholic, and turned abusive towards the end. I was the first guy she has gone out with since. 

However, our first date ended in drunken sex, and the next day, she put her guard up. She told me she wasn’t looking for a relationship, and that things happened a little too fast. However, we both wanted to keep seeing each other. Although I probably should have walked away, I knew I wanted to keep seeing her. 

Long story short, after 2 more dates, we talked about it tonight, and she once again stated that she isn’t ready. She said she is the happiest she has been in years, and wants to be single. She also admitted that she is talking to other guys, as well.

This devastated me, of course, but she was honest right after the first date. So we had a good conversation, and now I am deciding how to proceed.

In a way, I am relieved, and proud of myself for finally having the talk that was hanging over me. However, my ego is very bruised, and my insecurity keeps telling me she was simply letting me down, and that it’s really because she didn’t want ME.

So if anyone has been here before, what are your recommendations? Any advice? I am not sure if I should cut her out if my life completely, etc. I also would love tips about not getting attached too soon, since I struggle badly with anxious attachment.

I notice that there are alot of women out there who either make plans or agree to plans that have been made. Then when it comes to the actual date, they're suddenly invisible.
They agreed to go out on a date with you 7pm on saturday or friday and the days leading up to the date the convos were consistent and everything. Then the day of the scheduled date comes up, and suddenly they aren't responding at all and the date never happens.

Now I understand that many times the girl isn't actually down and finds it hard to say no because she doesn't wanna be rude. But why can't she fathom that it's actually more rude to be truthful and tell the man that they are actually not down to go on a date.
The idea of agreeing to plans with someone and then being MIA is so immature and disrespectiful. The irony is that these girls are so worried about confilt and upsetting the guy that they end up agreeing to the date, when flaking and ghosting is way more rude.

For the women reading this that have done this and do this to guys, why do you have a problem with just telling the guy the honest truth that you don't like him and you don't wanna go out with him?
I promise you, if he's a grown man, he won't be upset and not nearly as upset as he will be if he gets ghosted and flaked on.

It’s annoying me and I don’t know if it’s right or wrong. I’ve asked her why she has to tell her mum everything. She says they have a very close relationship since she was little.
She says she doesn’t tell her everything. She ‘knows’ what to tell and not tell her apparently.

2) Is it right for me to be annoyed?

3) Is it wrong or OK for her to be telling her mum pretty much everything that’s going on?

4) She says her mum likes to ‘help’ with things. She’s already bought us an expensive hoover for when we move in - GOOD OR BAD?!

It's nothing unique or original. So just see this as a therapy session for me.

I have dated a lot of people. None of them I could call the ideal ""girl of my dreams."" Some came close and others were far away from it. Growing up I've always had dreams about her. The girl who will come into my life out of no where and change it for the better. Someone who could love me fore while taking me on their big adventure that's their life. Someone who isn't afraid to be openly themselves. 

Suffice to say, I've found her. And she's everything I always thought she would've been. She's booming with personality and light. Her smile is so real and genuine. And despite not having feelings for me, it's almost like her affection comes from her heart and not from feelings like love. And that's sorta the thing...She doesn't love me. Not in the way I would like it to be anyway.

There's no other person in the world I've met who's like her. I don't settle. And when I do I realize that it's not what I want and I break up later because I want to date the person I want to date and not settle on anyway to fulfill a gap that's inside of me. The way I feel when I'm around her is a feeling like no other. A feeling that's 10x stronger than what I've felt being with anyone else. I know it's cliche to say that I've ""found someone different."" But with her, I genuinely did.

I hope as I continue to date in the future I can find someone like them. The dream would be for me to date them but I called it the dream for a reason. She's amazing.

It wasn't a no, but she said to be friend (kind of friendzoned but not directly). After that we continued seeing each other at some partys and talked.  


Fast forward a month later. I invited her to go out for dinner in the evening to talk about a plan for our friend birthday party. We didn't really talk about that for long and started to talk about other subjects like we used to when we dated. We did that for 3 hours in my car and then she asked if I wanted to see her dogs at her house. So we went there. She presented me to her mom who already knew some things about me. After that she made me visit her house and we went to her room. She showed me how comfortable her bed was (I think it was a hint to come on it but I was to captivated by the dog). So we played with her dog and I had to go cause I work the next day.  


My question is : Is this another chance ? Because I would take it if I have, but I don't want to ruin our friendship if I for exemple invite her for a movie next week.

Most of them are married or have girlfriends now while I've had one semi-meaningful experience: a girlfriend for 1 month, then getting cheated on by her. She didn't even think I was attractive. She kept pointing out my physical flaws whenever it was brought up.

They always get matches on Tinder and they've given me advice on getting them, but I've literally gotten 2 likes in the past month, with zero matches (lmao its sad, I know). I've used it at LEAST every 2 days. My type is somewhat specific (literally just be blonde and I'll probably have some physical attraction to you automatically, going to the gym is a huge plus) but still not absurd standards for my looks. I just swipe off of what it gives me, and most of them are actually way out of my league in terms of physical appearance. 

The main problems I can see is that I don't smile enough (not even in pictures), have thick messy hair, and a baby face without facial hair. I have never gotten a compliment on anything about me other than having a good build, but not a huge build. Thing is, I was literally told to kill myself just the other day in a groupchat with friends from a random girl because I wasn't attractive to her or any of her friends. I was told to end my life because they did not find me attractive and that I was a waste of space and genetics. I don't get it.

I say all of this because I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I see all these people around me being successful in the dating world or even just hookups and it's not that I can't get out of a talking stage, but I can't even get into one because there's literally no chance for me anyway. I don't know why people lie to my face about my attractiveness and then get told something different by literally EVERY single girl I've met in my life other than ONE.

So that’s what brings me to ask the following question:

Hey , so I met a girl who is 17 , around 8 months ago and since 8 months we have had alot of conversation and we enjoy each other's company....I have a friend who is just like my brother(consider his name as""Ryan"") , Ryan too was having conversations with her during the same timeline, from the start I and my friend ryan, we both knew the fact that she was into ryan. 1to 1.5 months later she started giving signs and confronted that she had started falling for me , I didn't took her words seriously and continued to have casual conversations with her and told her THAT HER FEELINGS FOR MINE ARE JUST INFATUATION AND SHE SHOULD TALK TO RYAN , WHICH MIGHT HELP HER SUPPRESS HER FEELINGS FOR ME , later she stated whatever she said to me about falling for me was just a joke. I being curious to know her real intentions decided to stop having conversations with her for a month. A month later I was informed that she confessed ryan that she loves him and they are going quite well. I got my answer to my curiosity so I started reaching out to her after that 1 month of silence, we were having postive conversation , sometimes she used to bring up conversation about her and Ryan and I too didn't mind , Things continued like this and I found out that she was in a relationship with Ryan , I continued having conversations with her though until one day she suddenly told me that we both should stop talking to each other, I assuming that this might be a consequence of her going in relationship with Ryan and Ryan being insecure about her talking me , so I didn't retaliate and decided to stop talking to her. The next day ryan called me up on my phone and said that he broke up with her and he is sure this time but he didn't clearly stated the reason why he broke up , I being curious decided to reach out to her and  know what's the matter. She said that the previous day she was on a verge of committing suicide but before attempting that she called Ryan and Ryan somehow managed to change her mind and saved her. Still she said that she broke up with him but didn't really stated the reason for her decision to break up with him to me . Days later I asked her out for a meet up and she agreed , we had a great time. In 12 days I asked her out and we met each other 4 times , we ended up ""making out"" on the 2nd and 4th occasion. In this timespan she at several instances told me that she loves me , I accepted her feelings and we are now in a relationship , Now she is very loving and makes me feel loved every moment, she confessed that she had been in many relationships in the past.


SHE SAYS THAT SHE USE TO LOVE ME FROM THE BEGINNING , SINCE I DIDN'T RESPONSE AT THE START SHE STOPPED HITTING ON ME AND THOUGHT THAT HER FEELINGS FOR ME WILL EVENTUALLY FADE AWAY, SO SHE INSTEAD WENT WITH RYAN , WHO WAS ALWAYS THERE FOR HER , ACCORDING TO HER SHE BROKEN UP WITH RYAN BECAUSE SHE WAS FEELING GUILTY AND INFACT REALISED THAT SHE ONLY LOVES ME, ALTHOUGH RYAN STATED TO ME AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY THAT HE WAS THE ONE WHO BROKE UP SO HERE BOTH OF THEIR WORDS ARE CONTRADICTORY


SHE ALWAYS CONFESSED THAT IN ALL HER PAST RELATIONSHIPS , SHE HAD PHYSICAL INSTANCES I MEAN LOVE MAKING WITH HER BOYFRIENDS , SHE ALSO STATE THAT SHE HAD TO GIVE ORAL JOB TO ONE OF HER BOYFRIEND ALTHOUGH SHE DIDN'T WANTED TO . MY FRIEND RYAN ALSO HAD HIS HANDS ON HER AS SHE SAYS THEY KISSED AND HE TOUCHED HER CHEST ALTHOUGH ACCORDING TO HER RYAN WAS THE ONE WHO INITIATED...... ALTHOUGH SHE STATES THAT SHE IS A VIRGIN, I DON'T KNOWN


I LOVE THE WAY SHE MAKES ME FEEL LOVED , WE ARE JUST IN A RELATIONSHIP FOR 4 DAYS AND AFTER HEARING ALL HER CONFESSIONS I AM  IMAGING ALL THE SCENES OF HER MAKING OUT WITH OTHER GUYS IN MY HEAD AND ITS HAUNTING ME.

This hug was our first physical touch interaction.

I honestly did not want to leave him. I cried going home and already miss him though it's already been a few days since then, though I'm nervous to see him again. Not too sure why.

At first I tried Tinder and liked a few girls in hopes for them to like me back to get a match, and then I found out that a notification system does not even exist and so therefore a girl that I liked has to stumble across me and like me in order to get a match unless I pay for a service I think, like what the heck. so then I pretty much just gave Tinder the middle finger and decided to delete that and then I tried bumble and that was literally no better in my book because right from the start I was told that on their website Women make the first move, like umm why?, I mean I know that guys can be problematic sometimes but in my opinion I think it should always be the guys that should be making the first move and not the Women because I honestly think that's part of what makes us men masculine. But yeah I just hated the fact that it's going to be the women looking for me and not me looking for them, so yeah. I deleted bumble too and decided that I don't think online dating is going to be worth my time, besides after I deleted both accounts, I did some research on these sites and found out that most girls on these sites just want attention and don't actually want to be in a relationship which actually ticks me off by a million, and not only that but they even lie too. Like congrats princesses, you have officially wasted all of our time and yours by acting like 5 year olds and not even making the effort to have an actual life, like seriously stop going on sites like fricken tinder and waste everyones time lying about what you look like and trying to get attention, and just overall please get a life. So yeah with my rant out of the way, I'm now going to say what I'm going to do from this point forward.

Personally I'm a geek which means I'm into things like video games, super heroes, action movies etc.

I'm also an introvert too.

And so TBH my type in terms of personality is someone who would be considered a female version of myself.

So with that aside I think the best places for me to find girls would be geek conventions like comic con or maybe even a gamestore like gamestop. But if I find an attractive girl elsewhere I might give that person a shot too.

So yeah here is my idea of what I should say/ask her:

Hey I just thought I'd come up and talk to you because why not?, is that okay??

Okay my name is Thad, nice to meet you, what's your's??

Ah okay that's a cute name, I like that.

So anyway what are you doing here? because for me I'm (What I'm doing)

Do you watch Twitch at all?

okay interesting, also I don't necessarily do twitch but I do make YouTube videos if you want to check those out, my username is (my username)

 So what's your favorite video game?

Yeah that's a good one, I have a lot of favorites to be honest.

Are there any that you play with your boyfriend? well, if you have one(Lol I think that question is very clever in a way).

Ah okay, well I'm going to get going, lets go hangout on Saturday, do want to? Let's give eachother our phone numbers (I will only say that if I know that she is single).

And for our first date I was thinking about going to an arcade or an amusement park.

And not only that but after I get to know her a little more I'm going to try to find the best ways to seduce her that way she will be attracted to me in some way, but how do I do that though without making her feel uncomfortable??. 

Overall what does everyone think of everything that I said so far??

I grew up as the 'fat kid.' I didn't have trouble talking to people and having plutonic relations. I was never really popular among women nor got any attention, but that's beside the point. I was often teased for being fat by my mates (and sometimes even my family), but I tried not to think too much of it and carry on with my life. 

Fast forward to early 2019, when I was 17, I was on the verge of obesity, less than a kilogram away. So, for the sake of my health, I started working out. Once I reached a healthy BMI, I started to like working out. My regime was focused more on endurance and cardio than strength. As such, by the end of 2019 and early 2020, I have had abs (not chiselled, but easily visible if I flexed). Around that time, I got random compliments from people (both men and women) and overall more attention from women. 

During the pandemic, I couldn't keep up my diet and 'lost' my abs and never got around to that diet again. I'll still call myself pretty fit, but no abs. 

Now it feels like I'm back to square one, where I can still talk to people and be good with plutonic relations, but have literally no interest from women. 

I'm not salty about it neither do I want to bad-mouth women who like abs, I just want to know if it was the abs that got me the attention. 

I should mention that I dropped out after high school to work in a high-demand, well paying but the male-dominated industry (DeFi).

It seems like dating is basically a huge game and you can't just meet a good match naturally anymore. My parents have always said to be genuine and date someone you have a connection with, which would require no real effort. But the dating world makes it seem like you have to have been getting laid since 12 to succeed. It just seems so confusing. 

Do I need to have had relationships for the past 10 years to know how to date now? It just sucks to see dating and sex in movie trailers at theaters, 100% of music, everything on all forms of media, even discussions in certain classes, and not feel a part of it. It makes me feel subhuman.

I meet this guy on Hinge and we talk for a few days, the conversations were so intriguing and we finally made plans for a first date at a coffee shop in the morning. He’s tall, charming, respectful, I offered to pay and he insisted he buy, has a good head on his shoulders. We stayed at the coffee shop for 3 hours, sharing our feelings of nervousness after not having been on a first date in a while. We decided to go to a pub down the road where we hung out for 2 more hours. He was unlike anyone I had ever met in my life. 

We saw each other many times after. He introduced me to his brother the 3rd date in and we clicked automatically. I felt so comfortable. His brother gifted us a night at a resort hotel originally meant for his wife and he but something came up. We had sex for the first time after the 4th date and it was unforgettable. 

Flash forward a few weeks later and my ex fiancé (35M) tries coming back into my life and I fell for it. I text Hinge guy I didn’t see a future with him and he tells me how great I am and he enjoyed his time with me and to take care. Well a week later and the fling with my ex didn’t work out and I wanted nothing more than to go to Hinge guy. 

We meet at a pub where he lived and talked. I explained what happened and asked for another shot. He reluctantly gave it to me and we kissed goodbye that night, telling each other we were gonna be dating one another again. 

4 weeks pass and I find out I’m pregnant by my ex. Hinge guy and I were going on a trip and I cancelled last minute due to “being ill”. He went with guy friends instead and I was happy for him. I reached out to my ex and we decided to terminate. I felt so guilty that I never responded back to Hinge guy’s texts throughout the weekend. He hasn’t reached out to me since.

2 month's later he's engaged to someone else. 1 month later - now he's not. Because 'she has mental health issues and loves her cat more than him'.

P (50F) - gets divorced. Post pictures that don't look anything like her on Tinder/Bumble etc. Say's she's 43. Had an attractive, younger, well earning spouse. She can't work out why she can't get exactly the same guy. She's constantly off sick due to anxiety and stress. She essentially 'catfishes' people, sometimes fucks much younger guys, critiques men who catfish her (i.e. 2 years and one beer gut away) and then wonders why they never want to see her again. She told me a story about where her and a guy essentially catfished each other and she was a nooyed because she blocked him first.

Nobody probably remembers my username on here, but I've posted a few periodic rants here after having the feels due to some fails, and taking a break, sometimes feeling like giving up and mentioning that in the post. Those breaks ended up only being a couple weeks, and the next thing I knew I put myself back into it.

This? This is different. I used to feel motivated and mostly optimistic about this dating thing (hopeful in finding my first date). Now, the ideas of dating apps and even dating in general, and maybe even crushes, tire and wear me out. I've just barely touched the dating apps on my devices in over 2 months, and eventually forgot they were still installed at one point. I had thought I removed them. 

I feel no desire, and do feel a slight aversion.

This burnout comes after a year of doing attempts in real life and on the apps in an on-and-off interval. The results I got were one of four things: Rejection, ghosting, interest slipping away, or simply no luck. I have not met one person from it. To me, it's no surprise due to past experiences outside of dating. I am surprised I even lasted this long.

So yeah, I've finally gone into a dating burnout and have no clue when or if I will start again. I've taken a real break this time.

I am starting to wonder if I’m “normal” because I can’t bear to do casual relationships without sex. But when I actually like someone and have physical intimacy with them, it always becomes long periods of self doubt and mentally draining emotions as they continue to date and fuck other women. It doesn’t make me feel good. Or rather, I wouldn’t mind but I find myself being less interested in men who do that and eventually I gave up engaging conversations when I sense that they have other women on a rotary dial and the “connection” fizzles out. It also doesn’t feel nice when it seems like they only come back when they feel like it at their convenience. I could date multiple men too but it is extremely tiring to do that while still making people feel respected. Yet with the current dating culture, I also can’t allow myself to just focus on someone one at a time because there’s a high chance I’ll get hurt and let my self esteem go haywire. I think some women do the same too to guys with casual go nowhere relationships. Casual after casual. Being attracted to someone who doesn’t seem to feel the same way and then drained by the others who care while grieving unrequited love.

I asked what he meant by that and then he said 'we'll talk about that later'. Because he didn’t want to talk about this over chat.

So with this mindset, I was ready to just let life happen and leave the apps for a while. A week ago, I match with this guy who has this really nice profile. No posed pictures - just ones taken by friends in all kinds of places - and an actual description that worked as a good prompt to message him. So I do, and we start chatting. And chatting. And chatting. For a straight up week, we were talking for hours a day most days, and creating this intense intimacy I didn't know what to make of. We set up a date, and I melted when a few days before he went like ""why can't that day come sooner"". He got my humor and held his own with some dorky wit, made me smile and laugh, and is probably one of the most self aware men I've ever talked to. I was honestly worried the spell would break in person or that he would think I don't like enough like my pictures (a consistent phobia of mine), but I got over myself and yesterday, I went and met him.   
It was a total blast. Literally smiling the whole time. We hit it off easily and talked for hours over drinks and food. Then we wandered around with a drink (yes, it's allowed here) and he said he's still willing to help me assemble my new chair. So I say you know what, sure, come put together my chair. So we buy some more wine and head to my place, and we spend time listening to music while I fed him snacks and wine and he put together the chair, and we just flirted. I could feel the sexual tension building up, but he made no move to disrespect my request not to hook up when he comes over. So he finishes the chair, sits on it in front of me, and we sit up close and just talk and look at each other, and I just tell him straight up he can kiss me. So he did, and oh my god. We ended up messing around for a while without going all the way, like I'd asked, and he just kept telling me how hot I was, how good he felt, totally making me feel like what the kids call ""a baddie"". It was just tender and fun and sensual, and bonus points, he said I was a great kisser. Considering he's relatively more experienced than me, his genuine compliments were really validating.   
I will see him again soon, might be a bit later than we'd hoped because of other stuff going on but it will happen this week. I didn't think this was in the cards for me, honestly. I was convinced I'd be single for years. It's way too soon to say we're dating, but the connection is definitely there. I'm excited to see him again (and hopefully boink his brains out).",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1126633,public,self,Had an awesome date and I just want to share the joy,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/quf2e3/had_an_awesome_date_and_i_just_want_to_share_the/,no_ads,0.0,,,

She said she was bringing friends so I brought my roommate with me. She brought a couple that left after like an hour. So it was me her and my roommate.

She kept low key trying to bang my roommate. So low key that the only reason I was thinking this was because of other little details that added up about her.

I had two options. Option A: Stress over if she was trying to bang my roommate and try to do a complicated analysis as to whether or not a 3rd date should take place. But then there was option B, and the phone rang.

It didn't take much to figure out what I had to do. I told her that me and her seeing each other again had a lot in common with an island boy just trying to make it. Neither thing was going to happen.

Me and my roommate laughed so hard I cannot think of her without thinking about that stupid fucking meme. I'm 32 the fuck years old, I'm not wasting time on a girl who even showed signs of trying to bang my roommate on a 2nd date. I was the exact same person as I was on the first date, the only difference was another person was there.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1126634,public,self,I'm gunna call this a major success because I'm not going on a 3rd date.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/quf44v/im_gunna_call_this_a_major_success_because_im_not/,no_ads,0.0,,,
