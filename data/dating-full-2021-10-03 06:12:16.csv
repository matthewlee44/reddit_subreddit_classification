So basically we know about each other our whole life as we are from the same small city, participated in many events and such. 3 weeks ago a small group of us took a 2day trip, me and her were on this trip. On the first day she gave me a compliment and us 2 and another friend talked through the whole ride and on the 2nd one she flirted with me (put her head on my shoulder and lap), this hapened when there were no other guys around. later that week we had an after party where she was talking to one guy the whole night, we were siting at a table the whole night so i saw she wasnt intrested in him. later that night she aproached me and we flirted a bit- So i thought this was the time and shot her a dm after that. i asked her out 3 times and we canceled all 3 of them. in between we also had and event where we sat together, we vibed the whole evening together to the music and i noticed she was very interested and constantly looking for my eye contact. after the third was cancelled one she asked me out and after 3 weeks we went for a walk on a nearby hill and watched the sunset, i thought it went good as we talked alot and also laughed a lot also made loose plans for next trips. this was 2 days before todays trip. so today we went for a 1 day trip and she seemed to ignore me as there was a guy that spoke constantly and you couldnt talk unless you were far away lol. but he only talked to her(the same from the afterparty), me and her had a couple of convos on the trip and we laughed but it felt a bit distant. our group went for lunch later and i caught her a couple of times looking and me and vice versa. so my question is should i continue to try to pursue it or just leave it be as i am very confused and runing out of ideas what to do.  
probably worth pointing out that we didnt talk a lot over ig, just a day or two before we tried to set a date for the date or when i tried asking her out, we just sent pictures to eachother and liked them. also we didnt dm since our walk, as she sent me the pictures of the sunset later that night.

I don't get it. I'll admit I've had terrible dates and never messaged them again or I had a guy ghost me hours before a first date, even that I can kinda understand and say asshole move but whatever. 
Then there's situations like this. I was hanging out with someone for nearly two months, we hung out at least 3x a week if not more and only had sex once. We both agreed we just wanted a casual connection and we were very upfront and honest about wants and expectations. He tells me what a great time he has with me, he gives me books to read, I think everything is going well.
Then I broke my leg. I needed surgery and I'll be unable to do much for quite a few months. It happened a few days before my birthday and I went for surgery on my birthday. The first few days he was supportive, offered to bring me coffee and a fresh book. Then on my birthday he didn't even say anything (I mentioned it was my birthday because I was having a terrible day obviously) and just said he was feeling down. I sent him two messages, after a week I texted asking if maybe a connection isn't what he wants/needs right now (giving him an out because I would have liked to remain friends at least) but I never heard from him again. 
He was always so upfront, honest, and blunt. I never would have expected him to ghost me. I feel stupid for worrying about it, it was a very casual thing. I can't help but think he did it because I broke my leg so sex is off the table for a few months? But we weren't having sex all the time to begin with so? Maybe he just wasn't feeling into it anymore but didn't want to end it himself?

I hadn't heard from her in 5 days so sent a text just saying I was happy with our pace and understand it can be sometimes hard talking via text. Heard nothing. It's been about five days since that text.

I know she has used her phone as she uses WhatsApp a few times a day. The other day she changed her picture. Though she looks older then her photos on Hinge and looked quite down tbh.

I’ve dated in the past but i have never related to or liked someone as much as this guy. I’m not particularly fond of the city i am from, i’ve lived here my whole life and i want to experience living other places too. On the date he asked a lot of questions about me moving and i was confused why he kept on asking it but i answered anyway, however one thing i did say is wherever i decided to move i wanted to still stay close enough to where my family is (my home city). I did mention the idea of traveling abroad to work for a year ect to work and I know he wants to do something similar too. We see eye to eye on almost everything, we have the same values, humour and he is extremely mature for his age. I want to settle down and look for a life long parter and i know so does he but i think during the date because i was talking about moving it didnt come across this way, it seemed like i was still trying to figure out where i wanted to be and i think this was a huge deal breaker for him. He has found where he wants to settle and was ready but i think i came across as if i’m still searching but in reality i’m not even sure that i would move so far away. He was questioning neighbouring cities and asking what I thought of them seeing if i would consider them which i would if i found the right place for me. At the end of the date he did say he wants to take it further with me if in the future it meant long distance which he didn’t want to do, he would rather not lead me on, the distance thing was bugging him and he wanted me to explore and find where i wanted to live as he felt like we were at different stages of our life with this. Honestly i just didnt know what to say at that point, a part of me was telling me to tell him i’m not planning to go far so distance wouldn’t be an issue, another part of me was telling me he’s probably making excuses. I went home last night thinking about if I should talk to him again about it because i really did have a strong connection with him but at the same time i dont want to come across as an idiot if i say something.

We grew up together. We lived on the same street and his sister and I are best friends.
I had a crush on him from the time I was ten or eleven. He fought a kid who took my bike and called me a racial slur. After that I just thought he was the greatest.

In my freshman high school (he was a junior) he started to give me little notes about how pretty he thought I was. We ended up dating for the next two years until he graduated from high school. He enlisted in the Marines after school and while he was    in the service we started to drift apart. I decided to break up with him. At 17 I just couldn’t imagine him being gone for another four years.

We only spoke once when he was on leave and there were hurt feelings and I thought we were done forever. But at his sisters wedding last year we reconnected. It was the first time we’d spoken in years. We both apologized for how we handled our breakup. 

We stayed friends until earlier this year when we both admitted we still had feelings and decided to give us another try. And it’s been great. We’ve been rediscovering each other. We’ve spent nearly every weekend together and are even planning a trip next spring. Everything’s going so good.

Last night we were falling asleep and I was laying snuggled up next to him and as I was about to drift off he said “I’m going to marry you someday.” We had been drinking wine earlier but neither of us was drunk. I was really surprised to heard him say that. I mean things have been great and we both said after our first night back together that we were exclusive.

I can definitely see myself with him forever. It might sound dramatic but I can. This morning he didn’t mention it again and I was hesitant to bring it up.

Flirting feels awkward, uncomfortable, and often doesn’t go well. If I could forgo it entirely I would, but I recently left a long-term relationship that took up most of my 20’s and now I’m faced with the nightmare of having to put myself through that again lol.

- I like this girl, she knows it. We were texting this summer things went well until her ex came back and she ghosted me.
- She’s at my uni so I’m seeing her every day.
- We went out together last week, everything was flirty, she was literally lying to her ex/boyfriend telling him she was with her girlfriends. 
- We slept together, I tried to fuck her but she told me she cannot do it ‘cause she didn’t want to cheat on her boyfriend. (One of the hardest challenges my sexual instinct had to face, God I literally couldn’t fuck the girl I like who was in my bed with me.)
- she’s moving into my city for uni so not seeing her boyfriend that much anymore.
- she confessed that she was into me before her ex came back.
- she’s not able to give me a clear answer about us. She says we are not friend. She’s like keeping me in a “maybe” situation. “I’m not 100% sure about what I want” “things COULD change if we keep going out together” basically never giving me a straight “NO” neither a straight “YES” about our relationship.
- her ex it’s like a comfort zone for her that from which she cannot move on even if he cheated on her multiple times

What do I do  now? (Considering I’d like to try one last time with this girl ‘cause I like her so much) 

1: Completely ignore her even when I’m seeing her in uni. No more texts, no more going out, no more attentions. Moving on and stop chasing her.

2: Continuing chasing her hoping for her to realize she feels better with me, so she can move on from her ex and start a relationship with me. So trying to take her out of that toxic situation she’s in with her ex.

3: tell me Reddit anon what you would do
————————————————————
What’s making me upset:
I feel like if I stop chasing her she’ll simply move on and forget about me. Also the fact that she’s moving in my city and I’m not trying to get her feels like I’m wasting an opportunity.

However, I'm very much unsure on if she actually likes me or not and here's why:

1) Communication inbetween dates. She's a bad texter overall, like she said she even replies to texts from her parents days after they've messaged her, so it's not just a me thing. She did say that she'd rather I call her, as she misses my voice and it's not the same when I verbally say something compared to a text. However, I've attempted to call her twice - first time she said her phone battery had died, and second time she said she'll let me know if she's free for a call but never said anything.

2) Actual fondness. When I'm with her in person, she's very affectionate - like she'd immediately reach for my hand so she can hold it, and when she sees me she goes in for a hug and kiss. So the worries of her not being physically attracted to me aren't there, but with other things like saying cute things she doesn't really say much.

3) Being supportive. Words of affirmation is one of my love languages, I love it when a partner says ""You've got this"" or ""I'm rooting for you"". I also say these things back, like for example when she said she is having a hard time with her assignment or something at work, I say something like ""Sweety, you've got this. You're smart and I know you'll smash this, don't stress too much and take your time with it"". But when I say I'm struggling with certain aspects of my life, I don't really get a supportive message or verbal response if I bring up something in person. Outside of the words of affirmation, being there for when they are going through a rough time, or are ill and you want to take care of them is something I find important. The other day when I was with her, I said to her I'm going to be there for her and if she needs to vent, feel free to call me. And again she never said she'll be there for me.

I don't know if I'm overreacting/being dumb here, but I'm just worried she's another person who's just leading me on and is going to drop me like that. Or that she's talking to other guys behind my back and I'm just being kept as the fallback option. We've been on seven dates and have more planned. However I won't be seeing her for a couple of weeks as she's on the final stretch of her professional qualification, and wants to tackle the hardest bits first.

So please, Reddit, am I overreacting here or is this just natural to feel this way? I've been in three relationships prior to this and I was hurt in each one.

I'm a teenager who only has experience in online dating, it's been like that until the recent few days. So a little background information, my goal is to study abroad, in order to reach my goal I have to take several English tests such as IELTS, TOEFL, SAT you name it. So I made a post on Facebook a few days prior asking for a study partner and asking for advices from the community. Then this fella comments on my post and says he's got similar plans and goals, I ask him if he's interested in a study partner and he retorts we can share data. 
 We spoke for the whole evening. During that he offered I should come join this event dedicated for a youth organisation and I promised I'll do my best to attend the event. So I waited for 2 days and visited the event without my family knowing or approving my little ""rebellious"" act. I found the meeting place and finally met him. Since I was a new member to the organisation he companied me and kindly served me food. It went on for about an hour and since it was getting so late and dark outside we decided we should get going. 
 We just didn't separate after getting out of there, him and I waited for our buses but it took some awful lot of time to get home. We discussed about many topics, our interests, some personal memories and our own plannings for the future etc. It felt like time had stopped functioning normally and that there was only him and I in the most crowded area. 
 Now we get to the troubling side, I feel like I'm catching feelings for him even though we spent only one evening together and some time chatting. I haven't felt this soft and needy for a long time, I always find myself thinking about him and hoping the best for him. 
 I don't exactly see myself getting into a romantic relationship with him because if it all comes to an end I might lose him and that terrifies me. I feel quite pathetic for typing about my struggle, it's just he's already become so important to me.

So a little while ago I hooked up with a close friend, for context she got out of a pretty shitty long term relationship maybe 4-5 months ago. At first we would hang out just as friends I really didn't see it going any where else but it was hard just to maintain a platonic relationship with her she is super smart, really funny, so nice to other people and very attractive. After a while the chemistry started to build to the point that our mutual friends would comment on it and she even had a SEX DREAM about me!! So I finally built up the courage and kissed her while hanging out at her place with her housemates, she then tells me that she has been into me for a while and I'm terrible at reading signals (facepalm). I stayed the night but we didn't do anything else other than make out, we were quite drunk, in the morning she was still super affectionate cuddles, breakfast in bed together and a kiss goodbye. 

So I start to think ""wow this is happening, she's into you"", we continue to message quite frequently but she's super busy with her studies, can't make time at the moment to hang out, she says maybe next week, I get it I want to give her space, I don't want to come across as needy, it was just a kiss ect. After my last failed attempt to hang out she said she would get back to me and I've gotten radio silence since. I think I've totally blown it but I have no idea how?!? 

I don't know what to do, I'm thinking of giving it another week and then just straight up asking her what she is thinking/feeling.

My name is Heather. I'm 27, my boyfriend is 31, and we have been in a long-distance relationship for approx 3 months, depending on when you want to define the beginning of our relationship. In short, I sent my boyfriend a few dirty pics and a \~30 second video and his response was entirely underwhelming. He just seemed almost completely blasé by it. I'm struggling with whether it was me, or if it's him, if it's early relationship growing pains coming out of the honeymoon period, or if it's just a symptom of long-distance.

As some additional context, we met on Tinder when he was in town for a work conference. He was a great conversationalist and seemed genuinely interested in everything I had to say. He was aggressive, but the ideal gentleman. I loved his ambition and values, but he was super down to earth and funny. We seemed to vibe immediately and things went perfectly for those few days he was in town. We had a lot of physical chemistry together and I don't think it could have gone any better, from my vantage point.

When he went back home, we kept things going. Basically daily texting and flirting. We had an agreement that we were exclusive and ""dating,"" so it felt like a proper relationship. Even if long-distance. I didn't suspect anything was wrong. He seemed happy and I was definitely happy.

I consider myself a very sexual person and one of my main love languages is definitely communicated through physical touch. For better or worse, I'm also just a really needy person. So being long-distance for the first time was tough for me. I wanted to spice things up and I sent my boyfriend a few dirty pics and a dirty video. Complete with the lingerie, good lighting, etc. Like it took a LOT of effort and curation to get everything perfect. I was super nervous to send it to him and I wanted him to really enjoy this gift. But his response was totally underwhelming. He was just like wow thanks this looks so good etc. Nothing escalated, he didn't send me anything back, he barely responded back with any level of discernible interest in me. I was really hurt by it and we just kinda glossed over it without mentioning it much.

Part of me wonders whether he's seeing someone else? Whether sexting him was too much? Whether I'm unattractive to him? Whether we're just not a good fit for each other? Whether this is just the reality of a long-distance relationship? Whether I should readjust my sexual needs? Interest in your thoughts and if/how I should bring this up.

So I am 16m and just returning to high school, last time I was there I was 14.

A lot has happened in the last 1.5 years, last time I was around girls I had hormones but now they have gone nuts.

I am ok at talking, not really nervous but not particularly impressive either. I am okayish funny...

I receive it fairly often from women and I usually just feel like indifferent acceptance, even if I find them attractive or am genuinely interested in them. I can’t ever think of a time where I felt flattered, stimulated, or positively affected by it. It’s kind of just like a nice gesture I guess, but without investment it kinda feels empty and meaningless. Plus, I pretty much know they will lose interest quickly so it just doesn’t seem worth caring about until it’s obvious that it’s more than just an attempt to get attention and/or validation. 

For these reasons and others I never really reciprocate or go out of my way to flirt because it just feels completely unnatural, and often feels uncomfortable or awkward. I never really know how to give it, and I’ve never felt more than cordial gratitude from receiving it. Basically like how you would feel if someone offered you a piece of gum. Like “oh cool thanks, that’s nice of you”. 

I don’t have any good memories or positive experiences of flirting. I only seem to have regrettable embarrassing memories of it. When I think back to times I’ve flirted, even if it was completely fine or even went well, I usually flinch/cringe. Sometimes when that happens I’ll quietly swear to myself for being stupid, or I’ll ask myself “ahh fuck, why did you do that? Ugh gross”. Often times I’ll have to shake my head or do some other thing to eject the memory so I can go about my day. 

Despite not even actively dating for this whole year so far, these are a daily occurrence. Good days I have about 10-15. Bad days I have about 20-40 of them. Not all are about flirting but most are about some form of bad, awkward, or embarrassing encounter. Some aren’t even that bad I just flinch &amp; curse out of instinct. Then I think about it like “what was that for?”. At the beginning of this year I became single from a very long-term committed relationship so I am now unfortunately faced with the nightmare of having to deal with flirting again at some point, and I don’t really know what to do about it. 

I’ve considered just telling my future date upfront that I don’t flirt so they don’t get confused or hurt by it and can just judge me by other factors. I haven’t gotten to that point yet though. Thankfully I’m tall, fit, a natural socializer, and pretty intelligent/interesting. Without these gifts I’d be doomed for sure lol. As it stands I’m just working on improving my strengths as a person, and improving my life overall.

I got a girlfriend when I was 16 but I didn’t really have anything serious until I was 18. After many failed talking stages and ghostings, I started dating my ex in 2017. 

She was amazing at first, despite being amazing, she had a lot of red flags.  For starters we slept together on the first date, something I never usually do. Second she’s 5 years older than me and I always date people who are either around my age or younger.  Third and probably most important, she has some severe mental problems.


I was blinded by love so I put up with it for a long time. This last April I had the straw that broke the camels back.  she went off on me for something really small and punched me this along with her not showering or taking care of herself so I ended things and kicked her out because she had been living with me.


For the first few months, I did the whole work on yourself thing and didn’t want to jump into anything else too quickly. Well she’s started contacting me again pretty much begging me to take her back and saying she’s changed and I’m not buying it. 


With that being said, I’ve really raised my standards since I left her. I know I deserve better, I want to find someone that I think is beautiful inside and out. 


Having said that, I have a problem when it comes to the dating scene. For starters, I’m an introvert and I get really self conscious around girls. Secondly, the types of girls I’m after for the most part just aren’t into me which is kind of a self esteem killer.

it seems like everybody has found some sort of serious partner when they are only 17-20.

but yet the only relationship I have is online, and the other person lives so far away that I wouldn't be able to see them.

I would love to not abandon my online relationship if it continues.

Long story short 4 months ago I broke up with my ex gf, overall it was a great relationship, but at the time I had stuff going on and needed it to end. I went no contact after the breakup talk and then…

Fast Forward, I want her back, still had strong feelings for her and everything. I reached out and it had some pros and cons. Cons, she said she had been with her ex again and another guy (whatever we were broke up) but still hurt. Then got mixed signals about wanting to be friends or a relationship. Anyway we chatted a bit, got a few breadcrumb texts almost daily that I responded positively to. Very short complaints about her anxiety or stresses at work. I confessed my feelings twice. 

But then, she would bring up feelings for her other ex or another guy. Kinda made me get hurt, and at first I ignored it. 

Anyway her and I hung out and had a picnic and went apple picking. It was a nice romantic date but after 3 hours we parted ways. Then no texts so I texted her and asked her “how’s it going?” She then said she cried at work and next day said she wasn’t sure what she wants with friends, work, another guy she’s talking to. I was positive and said you can talk to me about anything if needed and have some advice. 

I guess my question is what’s the long game to win her back. Should I keep up checking in? Maybe swallow my pride and talk about who she’s seeing and actually become a friend and win her that way? I do love this girl I’m certain, so I’d like to try or if someone has a better plan.

We’ve had phone calls, FaceTime, and long text chats (it hasn’t really stopped to be honest).

The thing is, I would like to move things up a level - in a healthy way of course. 
I’m not wanting to make us official or anything as we agreed meeting up and going on a date was the best way to do this. 

What kind of level could I move this to without it becoming too full on but more than just general chats, memes, talking about our days, etc?

In my past relationship one time I said I was not a fan of bikini posts in Instagram, I said I would like it and tell her it looks good but not publicly comment on it because I don't support bikini pics, she called me toxic for this and even got me to change my views on it for the time I was with her.
One time she mentioned how her bra might come out at a football game because her shirt was short to which I said ""that's not good, why not just pick a new shirt so everyone doesn't see that"", to which I got called toxic and controlling.
One time I told her not to send dudes snaps with her top in it while she was in a bikini, to which she called me toxic and controlling. I just don't think if your in a relationship other people need to be seeing all that in snaps sent individually to them. 
When we broke up, she was considering getting back together with me. I had told her who I was hanging out with the night before and she told me she was hanging out with people and when i asked who she didn't answer because ""it seemed to normal to tell me"". We talked for another day and I asked again and when I said ""I told you who i was with, why not just tell me who you were with"", to which she said no and wouldn't tell me who. I then made it known I wouldn't get back with her unless I knew who she was with because I didn't want to get played and have her break up with me then 2 days later invite other dudes to hang out then get back with me the next day. Don't get me wrong she has every right to hang with dudes, but for me personally I just didn't want to get played like that. To which she then told me it was ""the most toxic thing"" I've ever said to her and then said she'd never get back with me.
Also one time she was snapping a dude I knew wasn't the best of people so i said ""I wouldn't snap him"" just cause I know he's not a good person and I implied I didn't really want her talking to him either and she said ""well good thing your not the one snapping him, I am""

I’ve had someone “like” my profile and/or write a short message on OKC, Bumble, and Hinge.

I was super awkward and “ugly” as a teenager/early twenties. Barely went out and didn’t have many friends so I never got any experience with boys and dating. 

I’m 24 now and finally feel confident enough to date someone seriously. But the thing is, I don’t know where to begin.

 I’m too embarrassed to ask my friends of two years, I just tell them that I’m really picky. But the truth is that I’ve never even kissed a guy. 

I have experienced mutual attraction, however, but Ive always been too avoidant to allow it to lead somewhere. And I’m really scared of someone finding out exactly how inexperienced I am (which is kinda ironic). 

How do I deal with this? Has anyone been in this situation and overcame it, if so, how?
