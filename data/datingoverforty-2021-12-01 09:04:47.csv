4,r6snsr,1638401699,Just got dumped...need help processing,"I guess it's never easy right! Started seeing this guy for about a month, we've hung out a total of 4x. He's cute and we seem to have pretty good chemistry.  We were very natural when we hung out, nothing seemed forced.  I've spent the night as his place couple of times.

He markedly slowed down on the texting, but after I talked to him about it, he had assured me he's just not always a great texter and showed some improvement.  We had both agreed that for now, it's casual and see how things go, so no pressure.  

I did wonder if he was seeing someone else at the same time because after each time I spent the night, he was quick to say bye to me the next day, which was odd.  When I have casually asked what he did the day before, I could see his wheels turning in his head to come up with something lame like ""oh nothing much, just stayed home all day"".

Anyway, just got a text that he's been seeing someone else recently too and think it's best to break it off with me.  I do appreciate the honesty and text...cuz getting ghosted or faded and die a slow death is WAY worse.  That said, it still sucks.  I haven't responded yet, still trying to process it.  I liked this one and was having a good time.   The sex was great, actually pretty amazing (damnit!!), but he had the same name as my ex-husband (somewhat of a hang up for me) and a few other quirks that I wasn't a major fan of.  I'm not completely devastated, but reminds me exactly why dating sucks.

I was fine with it after that conversation. But later that evening as i was pushing dirty clothes in the hamper (it is full), I felt wetness. He had washed his underwear. WTF!

But then this woman came into my life and turned my world upside down. Made me feel things I've never felt in my life. I told her I loved her and I can honestly say I've never loved anyone the way I have loved her. Not even close.

18,r754z6,1638443313,Got ghosted (I think) after a 4 years with my bf and we’ve known each other for 20 years (and secretly loved one another for that long )!,"Hello there ok so I’ve dated a man I’m
madly in love with for very close to four years long distance.  We met 20 years ago at work while I interned and he ran the intern program.  The minute he introduced himself I just felt something when we made eye contact.  I was 21.  I kept feelings to myself and he did too…a few years went by and we were talking and got back in touch.
I considered him my best friend. He moved and worked for a large tech company in TX and we talked while we both sat in traffic. Sadly he broke
Up with his fiancé (I later found out he was so drawn to because she was so
Much like me but a bitch). He then met the woman he married and who gave him two gorgeous children who I have the pleasure of watching grow up and I
Adore.  My life is not as great separately…I marry someone that same
Year who ends up financially and emotionally and verbally abusing me
But the marriage lasts barely 5 years and I drop him, file for divorce but sadly end up with someone even worse on a rebound and oops in 2014 I have a sweet baby girl.  She’s the joy in my life and her dad well it isn’t good and we go to court and I’m awarded full custody.
My man comes back into my life via me  I find him on LinkedIn and reach out (just wanted to regrow my circle of good friends). When he finally calls me back it’s several months later and he’s doing so well and I’m so happy for him  he lets me tell him about my life over the last 10 years here’s the thing; he’d been watching it all unfold on Facebook since I joined Facebook in 2007!!! So for almost 11 years!!! My Facebook page was private how is that possible ??
I want to mention our chemistry and connection and friendship is incredibly strong and the sex is the best I’ve ever had  ever 
We’ve been inseparable ever since. 2021 is a rough year  he is distant on and off and doesn’t make a huge effort to visit me at all  he doesn’t have full custody of his children but I do and my child has high functioning autism 

Ok so fast forward to October where I went to see him and it was the best long weekend ….he was cuddling me and put a huge ring on my finger and said “this is just for a demo and we were practicing me being his wife.
I thought it was so sweet. The rest of the trip was great and when I got home things started to get strange 
A few weeks later he got distant and when I asked him what was up he said I needed to find “a real boyfriend a local boyfriend “
 Then I didn’t answer for a couple of days his calls but I texted and that evening 11/13 I called and it went straight to voicemail and has been that way since 11/13 and it’s 12/1

We talked for a few weeks and went on one date where we made out and after a fun evening I slept over (no sex just make out and cuddle). He had to leave town to see family for Thanksgiving and we texted everyday he was gone - he initiated. While gone he made plans to make me dinner when he came back. Date number two then was dinner at his place. He made a wonderful meal and I enjoyed seeing him again. Fast forward we go to finish our wine and one thing leads to another and we have sex. It was good and I enjoyed it. We did the post sex cuddling and fell asleep. In the middle of the night I woke up and he was gone. I thought maybe he left to use the bathroom but then noticed he was asleep in the spare bedroom. This of course felt awful as the last time we were together he couldn’t stop lamenting how good it felt to hold me all night. Needless to say I felt extremely used and decided to get my things and leave. I let him know and he seemed surprised saying that he couldn’t sleep all night tossing and turning and didn’t want to wake me. I’m sorry, but the man has a king size bed. I did ask if i was snoring (yes I’m a snorer!) and he said no. Anyway I left around 2am and came home. He did message me to see if I got home ok and to apologize for abandoning me because of his sleeping, but I still feel lousy. I will say up front I also have abandonment issues so the word alone made me feel awful. So I guess the question is, was I used and just a complete sucker? I know it was date 2 and sex can be seen as I’m just DTF, but he seemed to genuinely like me. It makes dating very hard because I don’t know if someone is using me until they do it.

25,r7dyiy,1638470076,Friends after a Break Up?,"So I was dating someone for a few months that started great but unfortunately things ended the week before Thanksgiving.  We had a great time together and I enjoyed her company but she felt she had some unresolved issues from a past relationship so she decided to end things to work on herself.  I appreciated the honesty, wished her well, and just left it at that.  She wanted to stay friends and made a comment that she knows she wants me in her life but I'm not really into staying friends with exes.  I politely declined.  I told her that I respected her decision to cut things off if she felt that was the best thing for her however for me I know what I want and at this point I'm looking for someone that is ready to commit and since neither of us at this point want the same thing it would be better for us to just go our separate ways.  She said ok but she was here if I ever wanted to talk.  I just said thank you and left it at that.  

Second part of this is we where FB friends and after a week of no contact I noticed she deleted me and actually blocked me as well which really surprised me because the breakup wasn't hostile however I'm not a big social media guy so not sure if that is the typical treatment of an ex after a breakup.  I can understand unfriending them if you don't want to see what they are doing but blocking seems excessive especially when the other party isn't contacting you to begin with but to each their own.

51,r8rxo3,1638631628,Getting to know him from afar,"There's a lot of talk about men generally needing to keep it classy for the first couple-few dates before talking about intimate things or making physical advances. At least over text before the FIRST date. I'm with most ladies and have learned the hard way that anything less leads to feelings of disappointment for women looking for something serious.

That said, how does this apply to budding LDRs?

Three months ago, I met someone online who lives in another state who seems nearly/potentially perfect for me. And that's saying a lot, bc I've never married and I'm pushing 45.

In terms of the long distance thing, he's an immigrant who's been in the states for 3 years. (During which time he says he's not dated anyone.) He says he's not opposed to relocating, if things work out that way. 

At first, I thought I could see SOMETHING (visually) attractive about him, but after several video chats, seeing him in various lights, I'm _fairly_ certain I couldn't possibly resist any physical, in-person advances. And, knowing me, after any physical intimacy, I'd be head over heels.

So there's all kinds of potential here. He's kept it pretty classy (I can't imagine an unsolicited D pic, for example), but he's starting to drop not-very-subtle (his English is still awful) messages or hints that he needs/expects more intimacy from our .... acquaintanceship?

Part of the issue might be that I'm at the very tail end of Gen X and he's squarely in the millennial cohort (44F, 37M). I can't imagine getting sexual prior to meeting in person, but I think younger people often feel quite differently. 

What do y'all think? Loosen up and give the guy a break? Or I may as well start an Only fans, if I'm so willing to get intimate online before meeting? I'm kind of at a loss as to how to respond to him at this point.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/r8rxo3/getting_to_know_him_from_afar/

I am getting back into the dating pool and I just want to know how y’all navigate that. 

A little about me, two kids, married for 15 years, divorced, then after that I was in a 5+ year relationship that ended earlier this year. 

When dating, do you just go out with whoever asks and see how it goes? If you don’t like the person romantically after a date, is it usually okay to just say and then y’all can be friends and everything is cool? Do you give it a few dates to see if there’s anything there? Is it okay if you have a date but are still open to go on dates with other people? Do you go on a first date as more like friends and set that expectation? 

As I’m reading this these questions sound silly, but I have literally never actually “dated” before and I don’t even know what I’m doing. I got a text from a friend that a male friend of hers was asking about me and I don’t even know what to do. I’m outgoing and friendly and enjoy meeting people. I just don’t ever want to hurt anyone or want anything to go bad.

I’ve always been pretty confident, but also a little shy when it comes to meeting new people.

Anyway, I am a widow and after a few years I am finally starting to get back out there and will probably try OLD soon. But…I find myself having some insecurities about dating that I haven’t had in the past. I’ve never considered myself super beautiful, but I’m told often enough that I’m pretty or attractive and I take good care of myself. But I am older than last time I dated, my body type is average, not super thin or fit, but on the curvy side. My life isn’t perfect and has its challenges. I have a good career and I support myself and my kids, who are teens now, and I don’t have drama in my life, but I do have things in my life that I’m working on.

I just wonder what men our age are looking for or expect. Is it more superficial? Do they expect that you have everything in your life perfectly together? Or is more about who you are as a person and the connection you have? I don’t know if I am articulating this right, but I’d love to hear from men and women about this, and if I am the only one who has these thoughts and doubts when it comes to dating at this age.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/r9bn11/insecurities_about_dating_again/

74,r9c4vs,1638696524,Specific Green Flags,"Im (49F) processing the end of my 1 year relationship and getting clarity on my dealbreakers and 'nice to haves' in this, based on what happened in this relationship and in previous ones.

I want to frame them as positives (so rather than ""dealbreakers"", ""must haves"" and have an example that illustrates.

Here are some thoughts so far.

Must haves:

- 1) Good communication / emotional maturity. Able to sensitively bring up things that are bothering them and listen, in a curious, respectful way to my feedback too. Ideally, able to practise ""non-violent communication"" or at least see this as a goal.  If an argument gets off track and they are triggered (let's face it, this is gonna happen), to be able to call time out then regroup and try again in a non-defensive, empathetic manner. Stays emotionally connected during this (or at least when able to regroup) and able to see the bigger picture of wanting the relationship to succeed.

- 2) Emotionally open, enthusiastically exploring / progressing our intimacy in relationship. Able to tell me what's deeply affected them in their life, what they feel in the present. Wanting (after getting to know each other) an emotionally committed, monogamous relationship with me (note this does not necessarily mean living together or marriage). Ie as into me as I am into them.

- 3) Respectful. Ie able to communicate without insults, put downs, one-upmanship, physical, verbal or sexual agression. With the understanding we all have bad days, and minor slips. In this case, see point 1.

- 4) Available, physically present. The amount of time is flexible, we all have busy lives. But I'm not looking for another LDR. Someone with the time and energy to enough spend time together. Our preferences there should be open to compromise..open to and preferring that to include my kids in due course.

- 5) Honest. Not just not telling a lie, but not concealing info. Of course, not everything needs to be revealed on the first X dates . But when we are both ""all in"", there should not be major skeletons in the closet.

- 6) An overlap of values / qualities / personality - kindness, inquisitiveness, intelligence (doesn't have to mean education), fairness, generosity, enthusiasm for life in general, optimism, healthy living (I'm pretty tolerant on personal choices but some choices don't gel with mine, eg drug addiction, smoking).

- 7) Chemistry, attractiveness (to me). Sexually compatible.


Nice to haves 

- Geographically close. Ideally within 30 min drive.

- Kids flown the nest or older than infants. Open to child free if they like kids and are eventually happy to get to know mine.

- Similar life stage, ie not about to retire or only just launching career. A huge party person is also at a different life stage to me.

- Solvent. Income or employment status is not important but ability to live within means is. 

- My love language is verbal affirmation, so if they are eloquent or even just heartfelt in words, this is a massive plus to me.

Im still at the exploration stage with this and am interested to hear what other people would put in each category.",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/r9c4vs/specific_green_flags/

Thank you all who commented on the post I put up last week. It really made me see things through a different lens, and I noticed over the last couple of days a shift in my thoughts and feelings about her  since I put more contemplation to work.

A couple of days after this post went up,  I got a wishy wash answer about whether she was still coming with me to my friend's Christmas party this Friday. The reason, her parents were coming into town to spend time with their whole family at a local casino to dual-celebrate her birthday and her mother's. While I was disappointed about the party, it was not a surprise. I told her I planned on going without her, and if she turned out she will be going out with her family on Friday night, let me know, as I'd like to take her out for her birthday on Saturday night.

It is now just a few days from her birthday. I have opted to not get any of the gifts I considered. I just picked up a funny T-shirt related to an inside joke we have, and likely will supplement that with a card. No flowers, no sentimental gift like two I had considered. We did wind up getting together yesterday for a few hours, and the date ended with us kissing, laughing and hugging, so it certainly didn't feel platonic. There was no talk about the coming weekend. I opted to not bring it up.

Questions are these:

1. Right now my Saturday night is open still, but I have a woman from eHarmony who has been regularly in touch with me during the last week or so, exhibiting high interest even though we've not had our first date yet. Due to our schedules not aligning, we've not been able to find a mutual opening until this Saturday. Remember: the subject of this post and I have NOT made anything official even though we've been in a ""situationship"" for the better part of the last 14 months. Do I just go ahead and make a date with the new girl, or should I do a check-in with the subject of the post first?
2. Whether it's mentioned in the check in, or at some point in a talk after, would it be the right thing to do to say, ""Listen, I have someone pursuing me right now, I think it's time we decide where we want to take this. I have a strong feelings for you, but it's not fair to me to if we're on separate pages and I'm letting possibilities pass me by""?
3. Naturally I do not plan to let the day come and go without an acknowledgement. Do I even contact her AT ALL before her birthday, just sit back and let her come to me, and see what she says with the next contact (which likely will be a text message)?",datingoverforty,t5_su6ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/rahyyb/follow_up_to_what_effort_would_you_put_in/
