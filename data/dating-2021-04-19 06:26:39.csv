I've been trying dating for some time, but haven't even been close to a relationship. I was looking up statistics on age vs marriage and so forth, and it seems like the average person is married at around 30, and has kids soon afterwards. The graph begins to steepen from 25 onwards.

I find this kind of intimidating. If I'm wanting to date *casually*, is it starting to become too late? I'm having a hard time finding someone as it is.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mtyjaw/strongly_childfree_and_never_had_a_relationship/

Here is my first post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mpxvtl/girl\_made\_the\_move/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mpxvtl/girl_made_the_move/)

So update is that the date was a resounding success!

Actually she didn't make the first move but instead she was a little tipsy with her friends waving at cute guys who walked passed and I was guy number 3 but the only one who turned around! lol so a little less romantic but funny all the same, we laughed about it

A little younger than I go for (Shes 21 and im 28) however I decided to stick it out and enjoy myself and we had a great time. 

Second date this Friday

4,mtyotu,1618832221,I need some advice/vent and hopefully some direction,"Hi Redditors,

First some background. I am a 29 year old man from Australia. I am a single father to 4 year old twin girls who I have 50/50 custody of. I got out of a 6 year long relationship with the mother of my children back last June. The relationship was abusive to say the least. Anyone who says that's men can't be victims of abuse in a relationship are kidding themselves. 

I have recently started dating again. Mostly online dating as I work a full time job and look after my girls so don't get out much. For the lack of a better term I really am struggling to be able to find anyone who is looking for what I am after. I don't know if girls are put off by the fact that I'm a Dad or if I am giving off odd vibes because I'm still struggling from the last relationship which fucked with my head. 

I have been talking to this girl since November last year. I finally met her last Friday night for dinner. She is amazing and I have clicked with someone like that for as long as I can remember. To me the date went well and even had a passionate kiss at the end of the night. 

But this is where I am confused and it's got me unsure of wtf to do. I have asked to see her again. She said she wants to but for some reason there is never a time available for her to meet again. Like she texts me all the time, calls me babe and hopes that one day she could meet my girls (which is a big deal for me) but everytime I try to set something up she isn't available. 

I asked last week if she was free, she wasn't but said that this week she would be. Cut to last night I ask what day she has free to meet up and I'm told that she is seeing friends and has stuff on all week. But then she says that if her friend cancels on her tomorrow night that I'll be the first person she messages to see. 

I'm starting to feel stupid. Like I am dying to see her but Im starting to feel like she doesn't share the same enthusiasm as me. And also the fact she said she would be free all week to then be completely booked up makes me feel like I'm just an afterthought and that it seems like I'm more of a second choice if she hasn't got anything to do. I might be over thinking it I dunno but I'm just really confused by it. I do like her and want to see where this goes but at the same time I don't want to get invested in someone who doesn't feel the same way. 

If anyone could give me some pointers or advice on what I could do I would really appreciate it. Thanks",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mtyotu/i_need_some_advicevent_and_hopefully_some/
5,mtyt53,1618832700,I hook up with the same guy after every person I date,"My (22F) dating life is pretty hard to explain. If I started going into detail about it, you would just get confused and it's a long story anyway, but I would like to share this particular part of it with you and see what you have to say about it.

Every time I stop dating someone, I hook up with this guy (22M). It's not literally after every person, but almost. I've never dated anyone twice, I've never gotten back together with anyone I was already dating except him, but that is probably because he was always just my fuck buddy. We never tried to be anything more than that (and I never wanted to). With other people it was more complicated than that. Most of my boyfriends were jealous of him and couldn't wrap their head around the entire thing, which I get.

I've known him for 6 years and in that period of time our relationship has pretty much stayed the same. I don't really understand myself when it comes to him. There were times when I was certain that I was completely done with him and felt like I would never wanna go out with him again, but then I always change my mind. I feel like that right now, too, and I feel like I won't change my mind, but I have in the past, so who knows.

I'm not sure behind my reasoning for it. It's a mixture of things. The sex is great, he is fun to be around and we always have a good time. I don't like him as a person and could never develop any feelings for him, I've always liked our relationship as it is, but I'm usually not up for those kinds of relationships. I like being in love and having a deeper connection with someone, except when it comes to him. I also love dating and I get bored when I don't have anyone around and he's always available.

His situation is completely different from mine. I'm the only girl that he had sex with more than once. He usually only does one night stands and would never consider having a girlfriend. So, there's me almost always having boyfriends and there's him never dating anyone and we've been having sex for years.

6,mtz3ja,1618833802,I Got Blocked.,"Hey there, denizens of r/dating !  I've been around here for about a month or so, looking at posts and/or asking dumb questions in posts then deleting them out of embarrassment.  I kept wanting to make a post about some of the experiences I've had very early on in this ""online dating"" thing (like literally a month or so, maybe less), and I finally have something to vent about (Yay?).  

Just to start, I'm male, 23 y/o, in the process of beginning my career proper (if the interviews work out).  I'm saying this outright because I know how us males can be sometimes when it comes to our interactions with the people we're interested in, and you might take everything I say with a grain of salt.  I met someone last week (a woman by the way, I'm hetero); they were a tad bit younger than me, and we hit it off very well.  For the next few days into the weekend, we progressively talked more and more to the point that we would have running conversations for the entire day.  There was a lot of enthusiasm: far more explicit expressions of ""Yes"" versus ""Maybe"".   So, we get (got) along well, seemingly.  We send pictures, share stories, etc.  Then suddenly, they stop replying; it was essentially out of nowhere (we were generally sharing if we were busy at any point in time).  I think ""oh, well they must be otherwise preoccupied.  That's normal.""  I go to sleep.  

By the time I wake up the next day, I realize that I am now blocked, and not just that, they had done the full ""change the lock and keys"" thing and changed their username and profile picture as well (at this point we had moved on to discord).  So, one thing about me: I have anxiety.  I'm working on it, but my first impulse when I feel like there is a possibility that I am being purposely ignored, ""ghosted"" you might say (I have some bad experiences with this happening in the past with people I knew irl), is to panic.  See, I generally get a bit sad when people I don't even like that much show disdain towards me, so you can imagine how it may have felt when someone I was coming to really like did something like this with no warning.  I then realize that there is no way for me to ""solve"" being blocked.  I attempt to calm down, attempt to rationalize:

* Maybe Some Sort of Unforeseen Event Happened?-  Said person had briefly mentioned family issues, and they indicated that they lived with their family.  Maybe some sort of telanovela, k-drama type-thing happened that forced them to do all of these things?  This is honestly a very unlikely explanation, but I've heard that it happens.  After all, you can't spell ""American family"" without ""dysfunctional"".
* Maybe I Said Something Stupid?- I feel like if I did/said something stupid, this would have happened earlier.  I don't have a lot of experience with getting blocked though, so I don't know why they would have stuck around.  The last reply they sent was quite innocuous too, nothing weird about it.
* Maybe I Look Unattractive?- In the past, I always felt kind of hideous (self esteem issues), but in recent times, I've increasingly believed that I look quite attractive, all in all.  Like, a 7 at minimum if we're talking about looks.  Still, I know that us males often are dumbfounded as to what/who females find physically attractive (Ex.Tom Hiddleston, although I believe the answer is the same as men; it varies), so maybe they realized they didn't like how I looked and decided to drop it after a period of mulling over it.  Once again though, no visible sign of this while chatting. (By the way, I'm not showing anyone on here pictures of myself.)
* Catfish?- If someone is catfishing you, would they make multiple, joking allusions to catfishing, or allow you to get near-irrefutable evidence of their voice?  Because that honestly feels like some high-tier strats, and also isn't the entire point of a catfish to ""lure""?  What's the point of letting someone go when they already are on the hook/almost on the hook?

In the end, I couldn't manage to understand why.  Like I said, it literally came out of nowhere.  I know that I didn't really know them for a long time, and that you're supposed to bury it and move on-which I will at least try my best to do.  But I can't help but feel a little sad, so I guess that's why I'm posting this, even if I will probably be diving back into the breach pretty soon.  Anyway, tell me what you think about this.

P.S: I understand that women ghost for their own safety, and-well I was going to argue that I show nothing but respect for everyone I interact with, especially strangers, so there's no reason to ghost me, but I realize that it is often impossible for women to know that, and in the past when I was younger, my anxiety had led me to uncharacteristically act paranoid and desperate in some circumstances, so who knows. 

 P.P.S: Even if anyone sends a message asking me, I will not be sharing chat logs.  Those are personal.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mtz3ja/i_got_blocked/

8,mtzelk,1618834921,Broke up with a girl and she said that she loved me,"Why is dating so painful? I (26M) feel like I wasn’t cut out for this. I was seeing this sweet, kind woman (25F) for about two months and I ended things with her at my apartment yesterday. I guess as far as break ups go it was polite, but I’m still just reeling from it. When I started telling her I didn’t think this was working for me she told me that she loved me. That’s when I really broke down and started sobbing. She wrapped her arms around me and held me as I cried and we cried together. How could I do this to someone who loves me? 

The reason I felt we had to break up is because I’m not comfortable or secure in my sexuality. She is very affectionate and was willing to develop a sexual relationship with me from a very early point in our relationship, and I, for reasons I don’t fully understand, couldn’t bring myself to want that with her. How could I consider myself a real partner to this woman if I can’t even make her feel desired physically like she deserves? 

I made an appointment to see a therapist yesterday after she left. I can’t keep going like this. I need help understanding why I am the way I am and I can’t stand the thought of inflicting myself on another person before I get help processing my feelings around intimacy and sex. It’s very distressing to feel like I’m lacking something that comes so naturally to others. For a long time I thought I could live with my pain and confusion, but I can’t stand the thought of hurting someone else again. 

Sorry, I don’t know what this thread is really about but I just needed to write something down. If you have advice or have stories you think would relate I’d love to hear them.

10,mtzho4,1618835219,mixed signals,"I met this guy from hinge about a month ago now, we really hit it off and saw each other a bunch after our first date. Lately he's been less engaged with me, not always initiating things and generally slow to respond. I had asked if he wanted to do something last weekend and wasn't getting a response so I asked him point blank ""hey, you haven't been responding much if you don't want to see one another that's fine, I'd just rather you tell me"" and he apologized and we made plans to see one another later in the week. When I eventually saw him in person I explained to him that I really don't want to be that person who keeps asking to hangout when the other person doesn't want to but he assured me that he did want to see me and that he's just been super busy with law school and final exams coming up.

Fast forward a bit and he keeps telling me that he's going to make plans with me but lately I've always been the one to ask if he's available.

14,mu00yk,1618837071,Taking things slow or losing interest?,"Hi, so I (M21) have been talking to a guy (M24) that I met on Tinder for about a month and we've went on 2 dates. He lives about an hour and a half away and I can't drive, so he's made the effort to come to me and go back home on his own terms. He's made it clear that he wants me to feel comfortable and we would chat on the phone for hours getting to know each other, but things have kind of changed...

I have extreme social anxiety and I was pretty much freaking out for most of our first date. I couldn't even look him in the eye because he's so attractive and just there... We watched TikToks in his car and I kind of had a realization that he's just a normal person, so I felt relaxed by the end of it. I felt a strong urge to kiss him for most of the night and I actually did when we said goodbye. We also held hands on the drive back to my place. He said I could have as many kisses as I wanted. Anyway, he wanted me to work on my self-esteem because I would constantly apologize for everything (which he said annoyed him) and say ""I don't know"" when asked for my opinion, both of which I fixed by our second date.

Our second date was this past weekend and he wanted me to show some decisiveness, so I planned our date, but nothing went right which kind of bummed me out. He noticed that I was not as anxious as last time, but I still couldn't look him in the face when we were sitting across from each other at a table. He's been pretty open about getting therapy and he told me that his psychiatrist gave him some advice... They said that I needed to work on my own anxiety and that we should start out as friends so that I could feel more comfortable around him. So he told me that he wanted to take things slow and I completely understood this because I thought we were moving pretty fast as well, but I didn't mind it... This time he kind of denied hand holding and kissing, which really sucked because I thought we were intimate enough to do that, but I suppose we're just friendly now. He called me out for being passive aggressive and sad for how I reacted to the idea and I kind of was lol.

I noticed a shift in his energy before our second date even took place. He doesn't call me anymore and his texts feel low effort. He would wish me good morning and goodnight every day, but that has stopped which kind of has me questioning if he's really into me anymore. He's been saying that he wants to meet my friends which I feel is a big step and I told him that my friends are up for that now which he seemed excited to hear about. He talks about sex openly and has made it clear that he's attracted to me, but I hope that he wasn't just infatuated... I've never been in a relationship before so this is all new to me... Why would he give me so much and then the bare minimum soon after? I've developed genuine feelings for this guy and I really hope he feels the same way...but I don't want to seem too clingy if this is not what I think it is...

TL;DR: A guy was super into me at first, but his energy kind of shifted and he calls/texts less. He says that he wants to take things slow and start off as friends..so I'm kind of confused.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mu00yk/taking_things_slow_or_losing_interest/

This is stupid logic. If someone else just *happens* to like them back; that does not make your feelings valid anymore or any less than somebody else’s.

I’m tired of feeling ashamed of feeling stings of jealousy or sadness around a person I truly care about. I let them go because I know they are not for me and all I want is for them to be happy and successful and if that has to be without me then so be it.

But don’t come at me with bullshit about how “you have no right to feel frustrated she doesn’t want you” “you have no right to feel upset around her” “you look stupid” “you have low self worth”.

I’ll try to explain- I left an abusive relationship of 3 years couple of months ago.
I did and keep doing the work and I feel better and I’m kinda ready to date again- but slowly.
Also, I’m working on being happy alone and single- and it’s my main goal. I work hard and invest my money, I learn a lot and workout, and work on my self.

Anyway, I don’t seek casual sex, but only friendship that will become a long term relationship- so I know I can’t hit up on any girl I see on the street as most of the people are insecure and hate themselves- which leads them to being toxic.
Also, I’ve got my values and I want my partner to have similar values.

I’m serving in a army base with like 8-9k people- so all the people I see around me are only strangers I see walking around here- as I work alone I don’t have anything in common with anyone.

How do you keep feeling happy alone, when all
my hobbies and work is at home(where I go only at weekends) and at the army I’m surrounded with girls who look pretty, cute, smart, and just every kind there is- but I know I can’t just cold approach them until I find the one with my values+my old trauma I won’t open up to anyone, and not every girl wanna hear and live with what I’ve gone through... I will have better chances finding someone when I’m out there doing my hobbies etc.

Same thing goes for when you go in the street and see someone you’re interested in or any other place, it’s just the general idea...

To disclose, I'm not very good at coming up with jokes, and yes I could just copy a joke, then reword it, but that wouldn't feel genuine. 

Also, if I do get a reply after I say ""Hello"" or whatever, I sometimes hit a brick wall. For instance, if the match asks me about something and I tell them what it's about.

25,mu1u15,1618842586,Don't know what to do next., So I (22M) have been talking to this girl that I have known for a very long time (22F) for about a month. She initiated the interaction and we have been talking ever since at least a few times a week. Asked her out on a date she flaked last minute but rescheduled for the next day so I was fine with it. Met up to smoke with her once just by ourselves had more of a deep conversation rather than anything flirty didn't really catch any signals that she wanted anything else to happen. Continued to text after that then she got mad at me when I cut off a convo too early by accident and I apologized and continued to talk after. Then she invites me out with her friends and one of my old friends to hang out while she was pretty drunk. Again no crazy signals stood out to me to try and make any moves. Now it's been a few days of no talking to her since I have been pretty busy I have no idea what to think from here. We are supposed to hangout with some friends and go bowling tomorrow but I is it weird if I try to make moves in a group setting?

I've been dating this guy for 3 months. Things were going alright. He told me he loved me first and has done so a few times. He has some personal issues he was dealing with and admitted that he felt down/depressed lately. Over the last month, there was a period of a week where he didn't call or text. I reached out to him a few times and eventually he apologized and we started communicating again. About 2 weeks ago, he got upset because I didn't follow through on our plans (I was super busy that day and took a rain check) and he hasn't called me since. I've reached out a few times and he responded via text hours later. I asked him if he was breaking up with me and he chose not to answer but said that everything is fine. I told him I missed him and he responded but didn't say it back and ultimately kept it short. 

He hasn't called me since and it's been 2 weeks. Although he seems to be answering my texts, with short answers which is normal for him, but I'm wondering is this normal for early daters? Is he doing this because he is depressed? Will he contact me again? Or is this it for us?

28,mu2jqc,1618844619,Who should ask the other out next?,"Hi! So, long story short, last Friday I went out with this person I like and I've been thinking about it a lot. Like, A LOT. We had a great time and, sure thing, I'm dying for us to do it again. Thing is, we've barely seen each other since Corona started, and most of the time (all but last Friday?) it's been with other people around, common friends and such. 

&amp;#x200B;

During all this time, and especially recently, we also talked through insta DMs, and she told me several times that we should hang out. She also said something along the lines of ""you never ask me out lately"" one of the aforementioned times we were with other people. When we finally went out last week I was, indeed, the one to ask her out, but I don't know how much credit I can take for that with her insistence. Also, I should mention we've barely talked to each other since Friday.

&amp;#x200B;

Hence the question in the title. Then again, I'd very much like to go out with her again, but we've also always had this sense of ""reciprocity"" where who asks who out isn't super one-sided, though this gets complicated with the insistence from last time.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, what would you do if you were me? Should I just go ""F it"" and ask her out again, risking appearing a bit desperate? Or play it cool and wait for her to make the next move, not knowing when that might be, plus maybe looking uninterested? (Maybe some common ground, like waiting a couple weeks then ask her out? I'm a mess right now, lol)

He ended things with me a few months ago, saying he was in fact not ready to get serious with me and he felt things were heading that way. It’s been about 2 months since then, yesterday I saw on Facebook he was in a relationship. Facebook official. It felt like a slap in the face. I texted him asking why so that I could entirely get closure and he told me he actually never saw us as compatible and spun it as though he wasn’t ready for a relationship. I learned a very hard lesson and have been questioning what makes this woman “better” than me or more worthy of commitment. I don’t deserve that and it wasn’t my job to interpret the lies he was telling me, I would’ve been saved a lot of pain and a lot of time if he told me the truth.

38,mu4swx,1618850761,Key advice to myself when dating again (F29),"This is my first ever post so I hope this is useful to you all.

So I decided to make a pledge to not date till September as most guys right now (especially after lockdown have been eased in my country) just want to fuck and don't want anything serious these days. I created a list for my future self so when I start dating again, I can be reminded of what I need to remember. Let me know what you guys think or what else needs to be added. 

• Get your date drunk ASAP to see their true colours. If they get touchy, aggressive or a straight-up dickhead, then you know whether to be with them in the long run.

• When asking what they are doing on a dating app, don't accept vague answers like ""Looking for a fun connection"". Dive deeper and ask them what they really mean. If it's a friendship or something serious down the line. You need to know their true intentions straight up. 

• If the conversation gets sexual within a week of chatting, see this as a red flag and means they only want sex

• Meet your date outside of the bedroom. Go on dates and have fun. If they suggest meeting at each other's house, then you know they are not serious with you

• If someone likes you, you will know. They will message you often and would want to meet up with you. If they seem distant and not excited to meet you, this should be a red flag and get ready to cut them out

• Set your intentions when you start dating. Let your date know you are looking for a long term relationship and hoping to get married down the line. If they act weird or become distant after that conversation then you know they are not for you. Don't be ashamed to be honest, as you need to weed out the non-serious guys

• If someone ghosts you, or is wishy-washy, then that's your cue to leave them. Someone who ghosts you have weed themselves out of your life which is a good thing! You don't want to be with someone like that!

• If they are not a fuck yes with you, then they are a fuck no. Delete their number and move the fuck on. Don't hang around and hope they change their mind. If they really liked you, they won't want to lose you. 

• Don't create a fantasy with the person you are seeing. See them through their actions and how they treat you.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mu4swx/key_advice_to_myself_when_dating_again_f29/

Hey all. I was wondering if i could get some input on a sensitive subject for me. I have been seeing someone for almost 2 years now. Things for the most part are great and always seem to be a daydream when we are together pretty much. The only problem is, they don't want a label on it. Says they are not ready for a relationship at all. But on the same note of saying that, we do everything normal people would do while dating. Dinner, hanging out, intimate matters and so on. I have broached the discussion of openly dating or at least give me an idea if it will eventually lead to dating publicly. But the answer is always the same. "" I have been straight forward about what we are and what i want"" I am starting to feel like i'm stuck in a revolving door of emotions with them. They tell me that they are not seeing other people or talking to others, but continuously have dating apps and are active on them. Have made remarks and advances on people we both know. but when asked it's only a joke its not serious. Then I'm the crazy one for getting jealous and upset over the obvious flirtation going on.

60,mu77kg,1618857234,According to my father I (27M virgin) am too old to start sleeping around and should be in a relationship instead,"  

Lately my parents,their friends, other members of my family and even my friends have all been pushing me into a relationship. They are probably afraid I will never experience feeling of love and end up dying alone...

Yesterday my father told me that I should find a girlfriend. I answered that I want to go through ""exploratory phase""(sleeping around) of my life, something people do when they are 17-21 years old.""Well you are too old for that now, you should have done that sooner"" was his response.

**Why didn´t I do this sooner ?** 

In my second year at high school  my girl classmate said that I have too much confidence for my looks (the truth is I have protruding ""elephant"" ears)...never tried to date or flirt at high school again. In first year at university I had Otoplasty (surgery that corrects prominent ears).  Unfortunatelly for me  it was botched surgery and my ears are still prominent. But I changed my hairstyle, grew a stubble beard and my ears probably arent as ""big"" as before, because women were noticing me and started to flirt with me. My friends and women I know wonder why I don´t date around with my looks. Well the reason...I am ""smaller"" down there. My ""member"" is only a 6 incher ,which is below my country avarege (middle Europe) and below womens´ preference (6,5 inches according to studies and internet,on youtube they even want mostly 7 inches). 

So I was afraid of being laughed at and cheated on. I was afraid my potential girlfriend would be with me for emotional part of the relationship and sleep with some hung guy for a physical part. And I would hate to be in a relationship in which I would constantly check on my girlfriend thinking she is cheating on me and be insecure and jealous of her man friends. That person wouldn´t deserve my insecurity ruining her happines.

To be honest even now I am afraid of this and so me sleeping around isn´t only for ""sowing my wild oats"" but it would be mine conformation that not all women wants 7,8,9- incher and some would be physically satisfied with what I have. ...I know the Reddit is full of ""size doesn´t matter"" stuff but I think it really does matter. Why would there have been preference at all if it wouldn´t ? And even if you are in a relationship with emotions envolved that doesn´t mean that physical part of sex is increased...you will not make 5 or 6 incher feels like 8 incher just because there are emotions.

But now I am at stage where I would rather dissapoint a one night stand/FWB than someone I have emotional connection with....The problem is that everyone on reddit says that I will not get good at sex with 7, 10... one nigh stands and I should find girlfriend instead.There is some truth to this and honestly I kind of developed PE problem so I will dissapoint a lot of dates. ( My grandma is constantly entering my room for every small thing so I needed to learn how to get off reylly fast)

However  the idea of having only one sexual partner terrifies me. I respect those with only one sexual partner in their life I truly do but my sex drive level is that if I had a bigger member I would be in porn,doing webcaming or something connected with sleeping around a lot.... And I know, I really know, that If I manage to find a girlfriend who is completly satisfied with my size,it will give me a push and confidence to sleep around with others and I hate the idea of having a ""training"" girlfriend only to get good at sex and then leave her to catch on those missed years....

Reddit am I really too old and too inexperinced to start sleeping around? Should I really find a girlfriend and hope those feelings of  ""exploring sex"" will tune down?

Matched with a ""cougar"" who was 18 years older then me. She had been divorced since Jan 2020 but was estranged from her husband since 2017. She had some pent up frustrations and let me know that she was looking for something casual and had a thing for younger men. We chatted a bit more and she let me know that she was DTF. We talked about meeting up Friday for a drinks at a quiet bar (we are both vaccinated and cases are really low locally). I said that'd be great but I have two deal breakers, no more then two drinks before hand and that we have to use protection. 

She agreed to the two drink part but said that she didn't like to use protection and that she trusted when partners said that they were clean. I said that I know I am clean because I got an STD test two weeks prior and can prove it but I still want to use protection. She kind of grumbled a bit and said that she'd only been with her husband and two other men in the last year. I said wait you were still sleeping with your estranged husband and she said yes until September 2020. I asked if she had been tested and said that it was sometime in April 2019 after she found out that her husband had a meth problem.. She said some story about how she would get lonely and that she had needs. I said you're husband has a drug problem and how does he use meth.. She said with needles. BIG FUCKING RED FLAGS.

I was like you need to get tested immediately, she said that she doesn't need to be told what to do but would do it to prove me wrong. So she got tested and the rapid HIV was negative and would let me know when the rest of the results came back. Few days later I got ghosted.. Removed from Tinder and Snapchat.

66,mu82zp,1618859580,"I regularly see women saying that they have far too many matches for them to respond to, and for some reason noone ever questions this behavior - why?","Every so often there is a man telling a story of a female friend, showing her Tinder profile to him (usually to his fascination with hundreds of matches). This often leads to a discussion where in the end, everyone agrees that ""of course women cannot respond to every single message, they have hundreds of men to talk to"" - and noone ever mentions that this looks like an extremely narcissistic behavior? 

If you know that you basically get a match as soon as you like a profile (unlike men who often get matches later after the woman has seen his profile), I see only two possible actions that don't lead to a large number of men feeling ignored. 

If you want to go through the whole ""set"" and see all men in your dating range, you just have to be more picky (kind of ironic given how often men accuse women to be too picky) - or reduce the target audience by putting stricter filters.

Alternatively, just stop after 10 matches so you have time to at least exchange some initial words - often that will clarify whether he is interesting enough to continue.

I know this sounds super basic and trivial, but given how often I see the scenario as a topic in some dating forum (not just in reddit), I felt like addressing it here.

I personally never talk to a lot of women at the same time (not that I had a lot of choice in the matter), which means that the conversations I had were all pretty involved.

73,mu8q7g,1618861340,Lucky on Tinder after years,"Well hi r/dating.

As by the title of this post you can guess how I met my new girlfriend after being single for over 5 years.
I’ve been active on tinder for a good few years but nothing ever came of it. I had a couple of dates throughout the years but nothing that was a fit for me.

Fast forward to July 2020 and COVID a still a thing where I live. I had redownloaded the app once more and started swiping. A few days go by  and I get a few matches but boring conversations prevail as always and having to carry the conversation is exhausting. However, after a few days I get matched with this stunning girl and while my opening wasn’t amazing she replied! 

We got a pretty good conversation going on Tinder and well things were just going pretty well. Things became a bit flirty pretty quickly as well. I wasn’t specifically looking for a relation ship and she wasn’t either so things were cool between us. However, the conversation dipped a little but luckily she messaged me because honestly she was great. She was engaging, intelligent, down to earth and seemed open-minded. We texted till about 2am that evening.

About 10 days later we decided to meet up. While our initial plans well didn’t work out because of the weather since it was a steaming hot day we just met up at her place. While we both initially felt pretty awkward we started feeling relatively comfortable quite quickly. A good hour into the date we kissed and had sex. I even stayed over although we didn’t sleep much since we were up talking and laughing until the early morning. We just clicked. 

So we both didn’t want a relationship to start with but lots of dates followed throughout the summer either at her place or at the park. Those dates were always so casual and just having a good time with each other. Spending time with her was a delight. As you know when you’re having a good time time flies. We knew each other for maybe 1,5 months and we went on a road trip abroad, keep in mind this was planned after around 3 weeks of getting to know each other. 

Well Summer is over and we both started to catch some feelings obviously me quicker compared to her. But by the end of October we both couldn’t really deny anymore that we basically had a relationship, we just didn’t define it as such.

Now it’s almost the end of April and we’re still so happy together it’s insane. We spend so much time together it’s crazy, we’re basically living together but not really (and yes that’s a good relationship tester). I love spending time with her, her personality is great, her worldviews align with mine.

So yeah I think I just wanna thank Tinder for giving me this chance and I hope I don’t blow it.

78,mu9kb3,1618863610,"How do you open up without ""venting,"" to someone?","So I hear this a lot from different people how women want men to open up, but a lot of men (including myself) don't know how to properly open up because we're socially conditioned to be closed off with our emotions and hold everything in. Which is also just as unhealthy as opening up too much and basically going to the other end of having someone being an emotional sponge. 

I've struggled personally opening up (outside of therapists and close family/friends) about issues. How did you open up to your new partner once you started to ""share feelings?"" Sometimes people want to know how the other person is doing but I don't know how to do that without feeling like I'm becoming emotionally dependent/needy on someone else.

I do see therapy once in a while for my own issues that I have to work on but is there a balance? Do you just open up to vent once in a while? I'm not in a relationship but am dating on occasion at the moment and in the event that I do date, I'd like to know how people open up because this has been a serious issue for me since I usually keep my opinions/concerns to myself since most people haven't cared about them in the past.

79,mu9qfz,1618864074,"How do I meet someone that is ""my type"" during a pandemic?","I guess you could say I am quite picky.

I don't have ""a type"" per se when it comes to physical features. I like people who take care of themselves but I definitely have a type when it comes to style (which might also be attached to the fact that style can also say a lot about a person and their interests). I prefer men that have a good sense of style (including tattoos usually) and dress and look ""alternative"". Another thing is that often times they are also musicians - something that is a huge plus for me, as (making) music is a big part of my life.

I have tried tinder and bumble and although I usually match with almost everyone I ""like"" there are only very few men that are visually what I am looking for. And if I do find someone that matches my criteria I usually end up realising that we are not a good match otherwise.

(I don't want to say that the way someone dresses determines how well we would match but experience has shown me that oftentimes my interests and lifestyle just don't go well with people that are not ""alternative"" looking as I tend to be rather ""eccentric"" and ""too weird"" for some people.)

I (23F) want so badly to have a SO that I can love on and talk to and be around but I don't care for the OLD (On-line Dating) scene  because it seems to revolve around ""hook-up"" culture. As an ""innocent"" I would very much like to vibe with someone because we can relate to each other or because we share the same interests or because--God forbid--we like each other. I'm not slamming those who do hook-up, I just don't want that and I don't walk to dilly-dally with people who ONLY want that (e.g., the majority of people who use dating apps). As the president of the 0-body-count club, I crave companionship that isn't rooted in or dependent on sex. I'll have it with ""the one"" but not everyone.....

I just feel so lonely..

83,mua69k,1618865306,"If they cheated on you, the relationship was already over in their eyes - communicating is the key to making sure that you won’t become the victim of an affair","People who are in committed relationships do not just one day, out of the blue, decide to cheat on their partner. Often they will spend weeks or months trying to bring attention to what’s lacking in your relationship (sometimes it’s sexual, sometimes it’s other things), with varying degrees of success.

If they have tried to get you to address their concerns without success, and they are to the point that they are thinking about getting intimate with someone else, the relationship has already ended in their eyes, even if they haven’t yet acted on it.

This is why communication is SO important in healthy relationships. Check in with your partner regularly from the start, make sure that both of your needs are being met and are on the same page, and if not, what steps can be taken to work through issues. If you start doing this early, it won’t seem weird or out of character, and if it gets to a point where things can’t be resolved, you can end it without the heartache of being cheated on.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mua69k/if_they_cheated_on_you_the_relationship_was/

I know it very well if I have to go through another heartbreak it might cause physical symptoms in my body (Nausea, Anxiety attack, Feeling of suffocation - which I had before). At the same time I'm just tired of this loneliness. I'm focusing on getting healed by myself and I think I've made a lot of progress in the past few years.

87,mub0dx,1618867622,Most people trying to date...," ... Should not be dating. I was horrible, particularly most of my 20s. I was depressed, not good in social situations, and would not have dated myself. I have done a lot of self reflection, worked on myself hard, completed grad school, understand myself &amp; been to therapy, work with a lot of people &amp; have a direction and purpose in my life as well as exercise regularly. I get a lot of matches on dating apps and approached in the wild a handful of women last year alone. Many that initially I thought were good matches... well obviously not!

Here is the pattern - people are either a) emotionally/intellectually unavailable, b) using dating to validate themselves in some way/social media addicts, or c) have some severe problem that they need to work on first before attempting to find a significant worthwhile partner.

88,mub0qv,1618867649,Friend virtually introduced us. Great conversation at first and now mixed signals. should I give up?,"A friend (29f)  of me (30f) virtually introduced me to another friend of hers (~33f). Yes we’re all women

She was in another country for a week and we talked daily on Instagram. At one point she even told me not to worry if she took long to reply, that she was not ghosting me, but that when she’s on holiday she doesn’t use her phone much. 

For once someone reassured me in a thoughtful way, which I’m not used to. 

So we talked a lot and she would always take a lot of time/thoughts to craft her replies and address every points of our discussion.

Conversation was great IMO: art, cinema, personal values, etc

We talked about seeing each other when she’s back and she said she had a lot to do when she returns but that  we’d find time

Flash forward to last week, she came back and we didn’t talk for 5 days. I didn’t want to be too insistant. But we kept watching each other’s Instagram stories. 

One night I talked to her and we discussed our astrology compatibility and I think we had some fun, but still no talk of a date.

We talked about our previous partner and where we stand regarding a future relationship (she told me she enjoys the new found freedom but is hopeful she can fall in love again one day)

She kept following up on each of my questions and seemed really into the conversation

A few days go by and then the conversation went like this:

- Me : when are You available next week? I’m free Tuesday and Thursday if you’re in 
- Her : that’s the only two days where I’m busy 😂 no luck!  The following week??
- Me: in that case I could rearrange my thing on Wednesday if you’re in?
- Her : nooooo do not change your plans for me !! 
No worries !
Next week is cool 
- Me : im not changing plans :) they’re just very flexible 
- Her : don’t be bothered :) We’ll  stay in touch early in the week because it also depends on work 
- Me : im not bothered :) but as you wish!

And she left me on read... but still watches all of my stories 

now when she mentions that it depends on work I’m just thinking it’s a good excuse for her to lay the ground to let me down gently in a Couple days if I come back with a date idea 

I don’t understand why she’d be so into our first conversation and then would back away

I know I didn’t even meet her but it felt like we clicked and I was really eager to meet her! Especially since our friend introduced us (virtually, granted)

89,mub2kt,1618867793,Who is that one person you barely even spoke to but can’t forget?,"Two years ago I went on a year abroad in Madrid and I used to go to the lidl near my house a few times per week and I often saw a man in his 20s who was working at one of the cash registers. He was really attractive and he would say hello to me when he was walking past me in the shop to stack shelves. I caught him looking at me a good bit and I was getting THOSE VIBES.. you know what I’m talking about haha 
I got a bit nervous around him because of how attracted I was to him and I had a boyfriend at the time (I knew we were going to break up soon  which we did  haha).
But anyways I stopped going to that lidl because of the nerves and feeling guilty for fancying this man when I had a boyfriend back home. 

It’s weird how I’ve had a few boyfriends and flings yet I find myself thinking about this random spanish man years later
