I'm in my early 20s now, and I really have basically 0 dating experience, and I can't really figure out what the general consensus is regarding how to go about pursuing relationships in this age bracket. 

I feel like as teenagers, you know basically everyone that's in your potential relationship or ""dating"" (emphasis on the quotations) pool. You don't actually date people, you already know everyone either from school, extracurricular activities you frequent, etc. Relationships start via mutual interest. Sure, you obviously get to know them over the course of your relationship and you could call this ""dating"", but it's nowhere near the adult version of dating. The way I view a date is you meet someone for the very first time, and just straight up ask them out on a date. You know almost nothing about them except the tiniest seed of interest, hence the date to test the waters and find out. I know that's not *always* how it's gonna go, but I think that's a pretty stereotypical date scenario. 

So where I'm going with this is; I've found another girl I quite like, and I'm in a weird inbetween zone. I know her via a mutual friend, and we've briefly hung out once. After that I asked for her number, and we've been talking for a little bit now and there seems to be mutual interest. We're seemingly pretty compatible, all that jazz. Do I ask her on a date? Do I just tell her I like her/how I feel? Do I ask to just ""hang out"" and *then* tell her how I feel if things keep going good? To me, I already know basically all I need to know that a date would reveal to me. My preferred flow from here would just be straight to a relationship.

Just curious on how people around my age feel about this. Is not going on a conventional date weird? Do women have a strong preference either way? I'm in very new territory here and I really don't know anyone in my life who has ever met a significant other via a date. It's always been just from speaking with someone they know over time and going straight to a relationship without much ""dating"".

There was this one guy that I Vibed with every time I chatted with him.  I got him into two shows and we talk about it, and I get excited over it. 

One day we accidentally bumped into each other in real life so we thought okay why not meet up. He drove  me to a nice restaurant and paid right. To me it wasn’t a date but to him it was. But it’s still basically my first date, I’m twenty one and never been in a relationship

Long story short in real life I didn’t find him attractive.  I’m just not attracted to him. I told him I don’t see him as more than a friend to be nice, and he got upset and said he was genuinely really happy and wanted something between us in the future, which was flattering, but I just know that I’m not into him. He thought about it then said it’s okay and he takes it as a learning curve and will keep his expectation low. He’s still not over his toxic ex anyways. 

Because I love attention I just kept talking to him. And at some points thought I was developing feelings, he’s watching a fav anime I got him into and can’t wait to talk about it with him!  Unlike every other dating app person we seem to get along well

So I asked him out again to the movies.  But when I’m with him, I still instantly didn’t feel attracted to him, AGAIN.     Not to mention he gives me red flags.  He goes on about girls and boys having red flags, but HE himself already gives me red flags - he seems like a nice guy that hangs around the wrong crowd, partying hard, social smoking drinking and drug taking, says to me he wouldn’t mind having a one night stand with one of his ex female friend, then changes his mind.   (To me RED FLAGS, and the fact that I’m not even attracted to him) These type of people have I’ve never really comes across or hung around.  My friends and I are always innocent good girl next door types that are never in relationships LMFAO

But I do enjoy talking to him, and I want to know how the show I got him into goes.  It’s best to start talking to him less and less, right? If I don’t want a relationship.

So I matched with this girl around the beginning of the month and we really hit it of. I decided to be a bit more assertive this time around since not being assertive enough was one of the reasons it didn't work out with my last girlfriend. And low and behold, it actually worked and I managed to ask her for a date pretty quick. But we hadn't planned anything concrete yet, just a date idea and a possible day.

A few days later I dropped my phone and it started acting up, so I decided screw it I wanted an upgrade anyways I'm just gonna buy a new one. 

The problem is, when I logged into tinder again using my phone number tinder was like ""oh hey guess you're a new user, let me override the existing account linked to this number and create a new one for you"". So tinder basically just deleted my account without giving any warning prompts. Customer service couldn't save anything. My entire account with the matches on it is just gone with the wind. Including the girl I semi planned a date with, without me giving any notice.

So if you ever get a new phone. Fix the phone numbers of any and all matches you'd like to keep. Or at least say goodbye.

(For those thinking maybe someone reported you, no that would flag up at customer service)

My gf games heaps. She plays for several hours every day. Usually 5pm - 11pm, and usually we talk to each other from 11pm - whenever we fall asleep. That’s basically our time. 

I don’t have an issue with it but more recently she has been playing games mid convo. We would be chatting as normal but then all of a sudden, the flow breaks and I would get a reply once every 10 mins. 

Sometimes she would excuse herself, other times it’s without explanation. I know she’s in the middle of a game cause I can see her online.

Sometimes she asks for me to wait, other times she doesn’t. I’m left waiting for her to stop playing, which is usually way past midnight. 

If I’m being honest, this makes me feel like I’m not valued or important, or I’m someone who is only around when convenient for her. I haven’t told her how I feel about this, 

I would tell her but I’m worried this would come off as me being needy, we have only just started off dating, and …

My gf also works full time at the moment and her mental health isn’t great. I know gaming is her way of dealing with it. 

Am I reading too much into this? Should I be feeling the way I feel? Am I being overly sensitive/a jerk considering this is a coping strategy?

I think my biggest question is probably does this mean she considers me boring? Am I being played? If I was really that interesting or meaningful to her, then she wouldn’t game as much?

To be fair, she did fish me for some of this information (e.g., ""Have you gone on any other dates with girls from these apps before?"", etc.).

She also stated how an ex used to do that to her and she was not into to it whatsoever (understandable). I owned up to it and apologized stating that is not something I will do again and understood how it made me look like an asshole.

Even though I know I wasnt treated right through a lot of the relationship( she didnt introduce me to her family after 4 years of dating and would often bail on our plans to hang out with her friends) I'm still battling to move on.

There were a few red flags from the beginning such as -

\- She didnt really introduce me to her family or make any attempt to integrate me ( kept saying she would do it on her time, her family isnt like mine. Had a really good relationship with mine.

\- She moved into her own home around a year into us dating. I spent all my time there however she didnt want me to do my washing or leave anything there at all because it felt weird and ""like I was living there"". This continued for about a year until we had quite a big argument over this and she relented and said it was fine and I could leave stuff at hers. She never oficially asked me to move in or anything like that.

\- We would arrange to go to the gym after work and she would sometimes bail on those plans because everyone from her work was going out to dinner and she wanted to join them

\-We started having issues around Feb/March this year. She kept saying she didnt want to give me false hope that things would work. I wish I ended things then and there as looking back I dont think her heart was in it. We told each other we would try to work through things however I didnt ever see her really change anything at all. 

She ended things as she felt like the spark and connection had gone and to her it felt like a friendship.When we broke up we hadnt had sex for about 6 weeks and this year we were only having sex about 1 time a month, prior to that it would normally be a minimum of 2/3 times a week. There was not really any cuddling or anything like that. I love physical touch and mentioned that as something I would like more of... she never really did that and said that it didnt feel right to her and she didnt feel a emotional connection to me.

I started seeing someone casually around 6 weeks ago and we hooked up a few times but I broke it off yesterday because it just didnt feel right and I felt I was only using this person because I liked the attention as I barely got any off my ex for pretty much the final year of our relationship. Hopefully this doesnt make me come across as a awful person, I guess I was pretty clear with her from the get go that I had just some out of a long term relationship and couldn't commit to anything serious however I do feel a little bit of guilt for it. I sort of felt it was for the best to end things given I have a lot going on in my life right now ( my Grandma passed away yesterday and I was really close with her).

I know that pretty much everyone goes through heartbreak at some point or another but I really had no clue how hard it would be and how tough it would be! She was my first real love and a part of me loves her still.

So is making an instagram or other social media something I should consider if I really want to find a girlfriend? How do you all feel about this? I'm assuming she just wanted to see what my ""status quo"" was like, or what kind of vibes I gave off on another platform.

She initiated conversation 50/50, flirted, etc. I asked her out back in early- November with tentative plans for a date (i.e. she agreed to the activity). 

She agreed to the activity and said she was excited for it, but was headed home for Thanksgiving and the date I proposed was after she left, so she would let me know when she got back and we would reschedule. Fair enough.

Two weeks go by and I don’t hear anything, so I send a feeler text. She says she has been busy but says she definitely wants to get coffee sometime (her proposal not mine). I say sure and offer another time and place. She says she’s not sure of it will work because of the busy schedule but will let me know. The day comes and I don’t hear anything until after the proposed time, when she apologizes and says she’s swamped.

I say no worries and (even though I’m skeptical at this point), and leave the ball in her court by telling her just to let me know when she’s free and we’ll make it happen.

A few days later I run into her in person and she seems somewhat uncomfortable and finds a reason to leave the engagement early (she tells me something  came up and takes a “phone call” during our conversation that makes her need to leave). I say no problem, thinking she’s no longer interested out, and that if she ever wants that coffee she has my number, if not no big deal (trying to give her an “out” to take, that it’s ok if she isn’t interested anymore thinking she would say “ok” and never initiate anymore). To my surprise she offers an alternative date (again) of next week for coffee.

At this point I’m totally confused, seeing this is the third plan she’s intentionally made and insisted she’s interested but without matching actions. I tell her, “Look, I’m getting mixed signals here and I value both my time and yours, so I need you to be blunt about whether this is going anywhere or not”

She says that she’s confused about how she’s sending mixed signals and says she’s sorry I feel that way, but she’s just been busy and I’m making it more than it is. At this point I’ve hit my wall and just tell her to forget about it and I’ll see her around.

Now I’ve run into her multiple times this week and she’s been acting super friendly as compared to the last time I ran into her. She will go out of her way to talk to me, wave and smile hello in passing, try and get my attention etc. Pretty much everything short of texting me.

I said she's really gorgeous and she said the same back.

She didn't reply for a few days, so I left her a cute little message after two (just letting her know I was still interested in talking). She replied after a day and we talked again, usually sending five or so messages at a time each. I kind of hinted that I am actually planning to go to Japan (I already had a trip planned but then covid happened) soon anyway, and she told me that she's considering going to where I'm from anyway. She told me I should tell her when I go there because she wants to hang out 'cuz I like you \*insert winky emoji here\*'. Which seems kind of gay? She's also sent me links to cute things and does ask questions etc, but then disappears for days at a time.

Basically, I'm trying to figure out whether this is a legit ""thing"" or if its flirty or if she's interested. I get thrown by her kind of disappearing but I also know people are busy. But the I get thrown again when she says stuff like ""I like you \*winky face\*"". I can't tell if she's just like ""oh this is a cute foreigner I may maybe meet one day if circumstances ever allow"" or if she's interested in me more currently then that, or even if this is gay at all. I'm open to getting to know someone and forming a LDR tbh, but I don't know that that's what's going on. I'm scared to kind of be too straightforward about it because it could be she's just friendly and messaging me when she's bored and I don't want to freak her out.

1) Being ghosted and getting a cliche vague rejection text is the same thing to me. They both make me think ""she didn't like me. I wonder why."" Both offer no real closure.

2) If you go on a date where convo flows well, laughter is had, but then you don't get a 2nd date... chances are he/she looked across the table for 5ish seconds and thought ""not fucking this guy."" Sexual attraction is paramount in early dating.

3) A lot of the self improvement advice is patronizing. Sometimes you just can't bench press / study your way into a relationship the way reddit thinks you can.

4) There are plenty of good and kind hearted men who want a relationship, but women just don't find them attractive is all.

5) The spark is nothing more than physical attraction mixed with a compatible personality. If my date is cute and convo flows well, I definitely want a 2nd date. That's all the spark is.

6) Logic and emotions are separate. That's why we often hear women saying one thing and doing the exact opposite.

7) Most people who status chase don't have any status of their own. Every doctor or lawyer I dated didn't care about my job at all, but that single mom taking community college classes would grill me about my job title.

I (24F) recently broke up with a man (25M) that I dated for a little over a month. Previous to him, I had one very long relationship and a couple of first dates. Now I have my reason for ending the relationship with him, which was tough considering I still had feelings for him. But thinking back, I’m thinking I missed some red flags. I was wondering if other people would consider these red flags or not? It could help me better prepare myself for dating again as I am dating to find a long term partner. Here they are:

- Labelling us gf/bf after 5 days (we both had different understandings of “dating” and I saw us as gf/bf a month in but learned it was different for him)
- Constantly saying that we would make cute babies and would ask if we should “Go make a baby” with a serious face as soon as a few days after meeting. I made it clear that I eventually want kids, but that it was too soon to talk or joke about that so often.
- Constantly saying that we should go get married or that he would go buy a ring. Don’t get me wrong, I eventually want that. But again, don’t need to tell me every day. Chill out a bit.
- pressuring me to buy a game when I clearly stated I did not want it and didn’t want to spend the money. Keep in mind he was also struggling with money and had other priorities for spending, like rent.
- Possibly impulsive buyer 
- Always showing up late. I would normally give a time and say to come around said time, he would show up an hour later without letting me know. When someone says “around”, to me that’s within a 30 minute time frame right?? Once I had dinner sitting out for an hour waiting for him. 

Like I said, I’m not a super experienced dater and still having trouble figuring out if these are red flags or not.

I’ve heard that high school dating is worth it to gain experience for college, so I’ve decided to try it out.

Just invited her to the movie and she asked if her friend could come. Being a decent human being, I agreed. She seemed pretty quiet during most of the date (after all, it was a movie, but before and after the friend did a lot of the talking.

We  clicked instantly and I was quick to confess my feelings for her,  although she never made it especially clear, she let me know she felt  somewhat same for me.

We had quite  a lot of fights, but often times I would calm down and diffuse the  situation, at the cost of my own sanity and at times my own self respect  (She would blatantly disrespect me, which was quite hurtful)

Fast  forward a couple of months, she moved back to her hometown, which is  all the way across my country. And it was her birthday recently so I  went all the way there to meet her. I stayed there for a whole week and  she only met me once. She even ghosted me on the day of her birthday as a  result of which I had to bring back her gift with me (looking at the  gift still feels like getting stabbed in the heart).

I  don't put so much effort into any relationships, and never has, but  once she ghosted me on her birthday I couldn't stand it any more. I came  back the next day and never contacted her again.

Couple  of days later, she called and I cut her calls as I was genuinely pissed  off and also a bit preoccupied by some work, and she blocked me within 5  minutes of it, saying ""fine if that's how you wanna end things. I was  right about my gut feeling"".

Now  all I want to know is, should I reach out to her or cut my looses, I am  way too much emotionally invested into this relationship but I don't  like being taken for granted either. My mind is a complete mess and  contradicts itself every other second.

I thought we had a connection because we used to talk about non-work-related things and we joked and teased and everything. We just texted because we are in a different countries and because of travel problems now, I never assumed he could come to see me.

I am very hardworking, always delivering and pushing my boundaries. He used to push a lot of workload on me, but I saw that as a chance for growth and learning. The thing is, aftere some time, I noticed that I am always doing this, giving maximum, but my pay stayed the same for 2 years, no promotion or any kind of that.

He also used to mention other women a lot, especially women who were our clients, throw that work on me, sometimes saying (not directly) how beautiful they are.

I decided to start to look for a new job because I saw I’m underpaid and saw great opportunities at other companies. Two months later, I got a great offer and decided to leave.

In my head it was like - if he liked me or this is a ‘thing’, we wouldn’t be connected just because of work, but we would find another way and I cannot miss maybe life opportunity job.

After he heard I’m leaving, he said nothing, just good luck. He always initiated conversations, so this time I sent him a message with a few questions which could lead to conversation outside the work and I thought we could continue with private numbers or something...

Anyway, it didn’t work out, I left quetly, he never tried to transfer our contact somewhere else.

I feel used and taken advantage of. I see now he used to send me those non work messages just to keep me there, like we are friends, so I don’t leave and continuew with my workload, being underpaid and quiet.

I (28) have been dating someone (29) for 4 months. It’s been fun. I feel connected with them and feelings have gotten deep and intense. However, we’ve agreed to take things slow and not rush into a relationship. 

Anyway, my person randomly asked me two weeks ago if I was dating anyone else to which I said no. Neither if us are. So, I decided to use this as a way to segway into the “do you wanna date exclusively?” talk as a way to kinda curb these doubts. 

My person’s response was confusing, however. They told me they’ve been thinking the same thing but wanted to surprise me during our weekend getaway (that was canceled at this point. Thanks covid.)

This was two weeks ago. Still never finished that conversation. Last week, per my therapist’s advice, I decided to follow up and see what’s up. They insisted they still wanted to surprise me and gave me a “hint” that just confused me more. We don’t have plans to reschedule our weekend trip due to covid…so I’m not really sure what happens now…

It’s now two weeks. I feel like I’m stuck in limbo. Like…if it’s a no, just say so?! It’s not like I asked for their hand in marriage or even an official relationship. I just asked if they wanted to date exclusively. Why does it need to be a big deal? I just wanna have an honest conversation. 

Honestly…this is starting to give me anxiety. I have fallen hard for this person and (in due time) I want to eventually try to build something solid and longterm. But at this point…I don’t know where we stand. I tried to be vulnerable and have an honest conversation and I feel like I’ve just been left in limbo and it’s really stressing me out. I’m not sure what else to do after I’ve already followed up. I’m slowly losing hope and considering ending this…whatever tf this is… It would break my heart, but it’s not fair to me at this point. 


TL;DR: tried to initiate the “lets date exclusively” conversation with the person I’ve been seeing for 4 months. They said they’ve been thinking about it too but wanted to make it a “special moment”. It’s been over two weeks since then and I still have no answers or insight and I’m growing frustrated and detached, despite really loving this person and wanting to eventually build a solid relationship with them in the future.

I hate dating apps but with the covid situation I figured they were my safest option so I re-downloaded bumble. Matched with someone before xmas (25M) and we’ve been talking casually on and off for days. He’s really interesting and our repertoire is great - we’ve been laughing back and forth and asking each other lots of questions. On xmas I asked him for his IG bc I wanted to make sure he was a real person (I do this with all of the guys I start talking to, for my own safety). He lives in a different city than I do, but we’re only about 30 mins away from each other by train.

We’ve been talking for a week now in bumble messages so I decided to be bold (FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE) and ask him for his phone number which he gave me immediately. I texted him 2 hours later after finishing up with some assignments I had to do for work (last night) 

He hasn’t texted me back and I’m wondering if maybe if could be a turn off for a woman to make the first move?? 

I just find it weird that he hasn’t followed up..

(28 F) 
I have been technically single for almost 7 years, the closet I have been to a relationship was an on and off fwb sort of thing. I am strictly looking for a long-term relationship from now on (I was looking for that from the start). I am being to think that something is wrong with me, I was on dating apps off and on over the past 6ish years with pretty much no success. Most of the men I message or message me strictly want a quick hookup and won't even go on a date first. I am not using sexually suggestive pictures (tee shirts and leggings) and I have put up front in my bio I am looking for long-term relationships only. 

I have been going to therapy for a while now, because I have depression and figured if I am having this little success something is wrong. I have repeatedly told my therapist that I am pretty sure I am the problem in this situation, they very strongly disagree with me on this. I have also asked a friend what they think is wrong they also have said that I seem normal enough. Now I will accept that I am not a social butterfly and my hobbies are very independent and introverted, so that is part of the problem. I also know I am not a super attractive woman (140 lbs 4/10 face), but I don't shoot for male models. Just looking for an average person who is able to be their own person and not devolve into a codependent or abusive mess. 

Everyone else around me seemingly can find relationships (some of which I will admit are pretty toxic) but I am stuck alone with hookups as my only option for a 'romantic' relationship. My fwb situation was just that I wanted friends and he wanted sex. Sex is pretty meh for me in general so I tolerated it for the company. We have some extremely different views on what we are looking so I never pushed anything even though we were decently good friends. The situation came to a sudden end when I got a text saying 'I don't want to talk anymore' so I haven't messaged or made any contact. 

I will admit since I am fairly introverted I have ended up becoming a hermit over the last 2ish years. I have a couple of friends, although most of them are to the settling down phase of life and do not have a lot of time for me anymore. I have tried to expand my social circle (per therapist advice) and I just fail to have common interests with people (essentially my co-workers). As far as dating apps go I have pretty much sworn them off and have accepted if someone is actually interested they can tell me, that and I am very tired of wading through the trash on apps. I have been on one date in the last few years, I got very desperate creepy vibes from him (over sharing his whole trama and life) and the last man I asked on a date said he would only be interested if I looked a very specific way. 

It has been suggested that I might be asexual, I don't know if this is true. I don't really care about sex I just see it as something you have to do in a relationship. I have been to doctors, got my hormones check (they are normal) made sure my vagina works right, and have done a bunch of other medical things to make sure that I am normal. The result is I just don't care about sex much. I can't rule out my depression messing things up, but I've always been this way, and it seems these days unless you can immediately put out for sex you aren't even an option. 

I would like a long-term relationship, but at this point I am working on accepting I will probably be alone. I do get a lot of outside pressure asking why I am single, and saying it is unhealthy to spend so much time alone.

First time in this situation, please be kind to me. I have no previous relationship or dating experience.

I have been friends with my college friend, A, for 3 years. I'm not gonna lie I've always found him attractive but he is kind of out of my league looks wise. I'm thin but below average attractive facially, never had male attention in my life and when I go out with female friends I'm a ghost. My life has been full of urequited crushes for years and thats how its going to be for the rest of my life, I don't think I will ever settle down due to looks requirements most guys have for their GF/wife.

I also believe he is out of my league because he probably has a lot of experience with women in his life yadayada.

Beginning of this year, with distance education and everything being closed down, I started talking to him more. We would chat on Snapchat, he would help me with school assignments, we would play LoL and other games and talk on Discord etc. It was funny. We would also have talks about politics and other stuff that were deeper. Suddenly this summer he asks me out on lunch. I can't go but come up with another time and date, and another activity. We go out to play minigolf, I meet his friends, a couple of weeks later we go out and play pool and have drinks etc. None of this is labeled dates. Before we meet up for pool he sends me a Snapchat selfie with lots of heart emojis. I have a bad feeling of it and don't respond or mention it.

Come september, he starts working at a bar/resturant for students and asks me to come there at his shift. I went there and talked to him for a while, it felt like he wanted to show off his bartender knowledge or something. The next day later that night at around 11-12 PM he texts me asking me to come there again but I'm already in bed so I can't.

The following months we are still writing to each other regularly, but the texts are being more suggestive and more flirty in tone. I go on with it, because this is the first time a hot dude is giving me any attention. However, one thing happens in school that makes me freak out about his intentions. He sits next to his friend and I walk past them and can hear his friend whisper my name in a low tone, but he probably didn't realize I heard it. This is when I'm thinking holy shit they are discussing me as a sexual conquest behind my back and laughing at me, because why else would his friend tease me in front of him?

However I also notice he is starting to play games as I disengage and go cold on him and hang out with other male friends. He asks curiously who I'm with when he sees my Snapchat stories of me hanging out with other guys. He later sends a pic of him and some other girl in the bar (probably his coworker), when otherwise he NEVER mentions other women in front me, never ever. Not even if I ask him. He starts flirting by calling me sweetie but backtracks when I ask if he is joking. Once I told him he is on my best friend list on Snapchat and he responded by sending a pic of him doing a heart with his hands and writing under ""best friends ❤️❤️❤️"" like its funny and I'm a moron. 

He also mentioned he was at a bar event he knows I like saying he lost in a music quiz and I was like so you went without inviting me? :( And he was like hehe did you want to? And I was like yeah and he replied true, ill give you my exam notes as an apology.
So he knows I like him and is teasing me like this? Not funny


He acts cold and hot but ALWAYS reaches out through Snapchat if I don't write anything to him for 1-2 days. Like yesterday he sent a pic of his cat asking me what I thought of it, after I had not sent anything for days. Stuff like that.

Does he like me or not?

I have a head cold and am feeling really crummy today, and shared that it would really cheer me up if he came over.

I certainly don’t “need” him to take care of me right now, however it feels like he’s showing me what’s important to him right now, and that isn’t making sure I’m okay. And I think a healthy dose of prioritizing one’s own needs/wants is definitely important in a relationship.

But for some reason we stayed in touch and talked once in a while. We actually exchanged letters at one point. Fast forward six years, I'm back from working abroad, and we ended working at the same place. We thought it'd be crazy not to explore this- he even said it was like the universe kept bringing us together (wow, romantic, right?), so we went on a date. 

He came on very intensely- but then would say ""Let's take it slow."" Yet, the things he said were not what people say when they want to go slow. He was saying loaded things like he was waiting for me for years, and the women he dated just feel like place holders, that he wanted to build me an art studio on his property, and go work abroad together. And on and on and on. 

We went on five dates- and there was a lot of deep conversations and belly laughing and clearly a lot of similarities and goals. But then on our fifth date, his idea was to come over to watch Netflix (lol). When he showed up, the first thing he did was ask me to be his girlfriend (which surprised me because I thought he wanted to go slow- but his words up until this point were so romantic and cute and seemed genuine so I said alright lets do this and we laughed). We ended up making out on my bed. We had been on a number of really great dates, and sex is important to me (and same for him) and we hadn't done it yet, so I asked how he felt about intimacy and where he stood with that. He re-emphasized that he wanted to go slow and was enjoying getting to know me and then asked me how I felt. I said I would be up for exploring that connection if he was- and then he said while smiling and hugging me ""maybe- we'll see"" and the way he said it felt like he was on the same page.

We watched the show, we have a nice time, and I ask if he's staying over- and he already assumed he was. We get pjs on, we get into bed, and we cuddle- and I told myself ""I'll leave the initiating up to him- since he is on the fence."" 15 minutes go by and I thought he had fallen asleep so I retired the idea, but then out of nowhere he initiates and even tells me he brought a condom (and that surprised me- just given his hesitation and his whole ""take it slow"" thing...so clearly it was a possibility on his mind). We had sex and, I'll be honest, it wasn't all that great, but it wasn't bad- I felt like it was a matter of just not knowing what each other liked. When it was over, he didn't say anything- and I asked if he was alright, if he enjoyed it, and he said ""yep"" but it sounded empty. Then he was super restless all night.

We woke up the next morning- he looked exhausted but his mood was entirely not himself. I made him coffee and we sat at the table and it was like he didn't even want to talk...I brought up the sex, and all he said was ""yeah. it was a good feel."" Then proceeded to pour the rest of his coffee down the sink and left with a quick goodbye and kiss- and didn't reach out all day. 

I noticed throughout our dating, he'd say one thing and do another and quickly pushed our plans aside if another came up- but I've known him to be a very laid back guy so...idk, we have a history and we had a lot of respect for each other and the way he talked it was like he wanted to marry me tomorrow but then would say ""lets take it slow"" (then just contradicting himself). 

I reached out to him and said something isn't clicking for me- I'm 30 and I can't do anymore relationships where there's no communication or confusion. He then told me we rushed into things and we are better off as friends- and that we could still hangout. I was shocked- like, his actions didn't meet his words and he had been saying BIG words.

So...idk...I guess my ego is hurt- and then I'm looking back and thinking where did I go wrong, because I don't want to repeat it. I just don't understand a person, one you have a history with, could say all these things and even go as far as wanting me to be his girlfriend and then dumps me the next day. None of it makes any sense. 

Was I used? Do you detect where I might've gone wrong in this? It would've meant nothing if I didn't have a history with this person- so I'm just so confused.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1142268,public,self,"""Let's take it slow"" ...wut?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rrdfyx/lets_take_it_slow_wut/,no_ads,0,dating,,,

But then we had serious talk and decided to break up(mostly from her side but I agreed because it was the right thing to do ) because she is planning on studying abroad and I have good and stable job in our hometown.

So we didn't want to prolong inevitable, she basically told me she didn't have planned to date anybody but I appeared and some things happened between us. And she was afraid that if we stay together she will fall in love with me more and not be able to leave me and go abroad.

Breakup was kinda weird since she is working on part-time in my job so I insisted that we will meet like a week after break up and talk because I didnt want it to be weird between us in work (main reason was I saw her cry in job the next day we broke up because she wasnt handling it well) So we talked and agreed that we will stay friends and continue on meeting each other.

So 2 months passed and things happened. Like all of sudden she sent me here cute photo when she was drinking with her friends. Then next days she was texting me how her day was and wishing me good night and so on. And basically we are texting every day and when we meet it's always great. Also I noticed that sometimes she is looking at me and smiling for no reason.

And now the 2 months after the break up I realized I still miss her and have feelings towards her. So I am asking for advice if I should tell her how I feel about her or better keep it to myself.

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 3 years now and he is extremely sensitive/emotional (not a bad thing) so breaking up with him will hurt him like nothing else. 

I have tried bringing up this conversation with him before but he starts crying and has actually threatened to hang himself. :( That scares the absolute crap out of me. .

He hardly has any friends, and all his family live in another province so he basically has no support post-breakup. 

We also just signed a 1-year lease together so that poses another huge issue. However, I know this relationship has run its course and is getting worse before it gets better, so I am willing to do what I have to do to set us both free and on better paths. We can't keep going on like this.


Here are the issues...

We fight almost all the time. Everything I say or he says escalates into one of us raising our voice at the other one for some reason. We are incompatible sexually (he's always asking when he's drunk only and I'm always turning it down because that puts me off.) He gets drunk a fair amount and I don't like being around who he is when he's had about 6+ beers. He brings up an issue or fight every time he drinks. 

Another reason is he doesn't let me see my family as often as I'd like because they live about an hour drive from us and he hates the drive. For Christmas he rushed me away from them after only a couple hours of visiting. Family is hugely important to me. 

The biggest reason for me wanting to end things is that he introduced me to a life of hard partying and cocaine. :( I am now 11 months clean but we met during that phase of my life, and once that was taken away, it felt like we didn't have as much in common as we'd previously thought. He is clean now too but I think that may only be because of me wanting him to be. I also just quit smoking 2 months ago but he still smokes heavily and I'm not about that life anymore so smelling it all the time grosses me out. 

Superficially, our tastes in music, movies, art etc. are completely different and it sucks because I'm very passionate about music especially. 


Pros:

My family loves him and thinks his quiet demeanor balances me out. (I'm very fun loving, laughing all the time, silly, boisterous etc.) 

He is very sweet deep down. He means well, he spoils me with gifts and little things to show he's thinking of me etc. 

We own a bunny together and I know that sounds dumb but I don't know who the bunny would go to so that complicates things. 


I don't want to hurt him, but this isn't how I want to spend the rest of my life. Thanks for listening to me vent.

I started talking to this guy a few weeks ago (on bumble 😆) and we definitely have a lot of common interests.. it’s all small talk right now but he seems cool. I definitely would like to continue getting to know him. 

He messaged me on bumble right before the holidays and must have noticed that I’m out of town. He messaged me this: 

“So you’re in NY, how long till your back in SC?  And are you having fun up there?” 

There’s more texts but that was his latest message to me and it got me thinking if he was starting to gain interest and he’s working on asking me on a date…? Or he’s just making small talk..? 

I messaged him back and I’m not sure if I’m sounding interested in him especially when I mentioned my trip/length. 

“I’m so jealous. How much time did you spend in Aspen and Breckenridge? That must be really difficult for you but I’m glad you can still enjoy your hobbies! I agree with that justification lol
(We are both into snowboarding and he told me he might have an issue w/his knee.. that’s why I said all that) 

And this was my response to his NY text:

I (35f) met Mark (38m) on bumble and we chatted for a few days before exchanging numbers. Right away and every day he was showering me with a lot of praise and compliments pretty much about everything from my appearance to my job to my hobbies or just random stuff I did that day. He also texted me from goid morning to goodnight and all day in between, all of which seemed kinda off to me for some reason. He was also super attractive, which makes me kinda dick blind...yikes. We didn't get the chance to bang tho. 

He often talked himself up saying things like how he was kind and caring and a nice guy, and thoughful, loving etc, and he was very, very flirty, whereas I am more sparse with my flirting and don't get into a sexually charged conversation before I've met someone. 

I felt often in texting like he was trying to get me to admit to liking him and trying to get me emotionally involved, which is not really my sytle as I am more slow paced and gaurded while getting to know a person. 

We weren't able to meet up right away but talked on the phone for about two hours one night, and video chatted another night for a couple hours and we seemed to get along really well, and seemed into eachother, etc. And obviously to me he seemed super into me. 

He texted me pretty much from sun up to sundown daily, and although was not as eager to reply as he seemed, I admit I did enjoy having someone so interested in me. 

So we finally meet up for lunch and things seem fine; we got along great until I felt like he started asking me really personal questions and putting me on the spot and I felt like he was enjoying it by the way he was firing the questions off at me really straight faced and one after another asking me questions and then asking me why in really rapid sucession. Aftwards, he started asking me questions which felt like him maybe trying to make me feel stupid. He said that women can never tell which way is which, and then he asked me in what felt like a condesending way which way was west. I generally orient myself by the mountains and said west was that way because the mountains are that way and he said no, look at the sun. I looked over and the blinds were pulled and I couldn't see outside and he asked me what direction the sun was in the sky in a mocking tone. He did this once again with another question and I just brushed it off and steared the conversation away from that and he seemed uncomfortable and asked the waiter to bring him the cheque and asked me if I had to go to the bathroom, which I thought was odd...I did have to pee but I felt uncomfortable that he asked for some reason. Anyways he really seemed like he wanted to leave and told me to start my car to let it warm up and he started his, and literally seemed to high tail it out of there....but the texting still continued as normal after this incident, which made me kinda less communicative. Still though he texted with me about cuddling and sent me a gif of a cat getting a massage saying it could be one of us, and that he gives epic massages. I was even more gaurded at this point, but honestly have a high libido...which I guess is why I still engaged....the d blindness... 

Fast forward to the next day and this man is still texting me from good morning all the way until he asks me to call him and he tells me he doesn't feel a connection.

He took my virginity when I was 17 and it went on for four years, honestly I loved it. About 6 months into it I asked him if he wanted to date and he essentially said no, he gave some BS culture reason, but 17-year-old me didnt even care. I was a little irritated but honestly just kept going for good sex he was amazing in bed: 8.5 inches, great Rythm, stamina etc. and I lost feelings for him but it kept happening. After high school we both went to college and it kept happening, obviously there were times I wanted to stop, but I would do good for a few weeks and end up in his bedroom. This caused some depression, alot of crying and anxiety and this year I told him I was done and I meant it, I started going to therapy and have been celibate for 15 months now. I told him not to reach out to me and he doesnt apart to wish me a happy birthday, and holidays etc

I started dating around and have been on dates with 5 fantastic men but I feel ""stuck"" its so weird. What if Im not able to feel what I felt with him (sexually and emotionally), I read that the average penis is like 5 inches (nothing wrong with that i guess), and when you hear about premature ejaculation, and women not being able to orgasm from sex it scares me, because with my FWB I could have an orgasm 5-10 times a session easily and Im scared I may not feel that again. Am I wrong?? Am I making sense?? I dont plan on going back to him but this has been on my mind ALOT and its making me not be able to move forward I dont think, its almost like he is imprinted in my head its so annoying.

Met online. 

I find her very attractive, smart, kind, and funny. We have a lot of fun together, and this is definitely one of the healthier relationships I have been in. She is in law school, and has been pretty stressed out recently with internship stuff. I was playing with her hair recently and noticed a pretty big crusted scab in the back of her scalp (she has thick hair, so it's not really noticeable if you're not moving the hair around). I asked her if she was okay, because it looked painful, and she sort of brushed it off. Then I saw a few other smaller ones around her scalp, and she admitted she has struggled with a skin-picking disorder since she was younger, and she feels the compulsions more when she is under stress.  I feel like an asshole for instantly feeling a little disgusted by the habit - it just feels really unhygienic and potentially dangerous (infection?), and I'm not sure if this is something that can easily be ""cured"" since she has had this habit for over a decade. 

Has anyone else had an experience with something like this? Like discovering some sort of habit in a new partner? Did you overcome the initial gut reaction?
