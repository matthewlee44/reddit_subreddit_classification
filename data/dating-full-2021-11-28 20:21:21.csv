I (f,24) met a guy(m,35) on bumble. We live in different cities (like 3h away). We haven’t spoken much but we liked each other and kept in touch for about a month and he said he’d come to meet me. By keeping in touch I mean maybe talking once a week. 

Recently he hit me up and said he’d come over a weekend. He booked a restaurant in a very nice fancy place and we went for dinner. I’d say conversation was going pretty nice and we had a lot in common. There was no sexual context or things like that, but I feel like there was chemistry. Then we had a walk and in the end he requested me a taxi to get home. After I got home, we followed up and both thanked each other for a great evening. 

To me, I’d like to communicate more with him and I would even not mind going and visiting him in his city but I haven’t heard from him for a day.

When we met I was very depressed. Life was such a struggle and without her support I don't know what would have become of me.
Fast forward to summer 2020 and she broke up with me and has since moved back to her home town. Honestly, it's mostly my fault we broke up, my emotions were very erratic and I definitely had a hard time keeping control of my temper. I often found ways to blame her for a lot of my anger which probably made it very difficult to live with me.

I've since spent the past year working hard on myself. I exercise, quit smoking (something she regularly asked me to do), I've built up my social circles and I'm back at school studying a PhD, I'm truly happy (most days), and most importantly, I started seeing a therapist (something she would often ask me to do). People I've dated since have even told me how good I am at communicating my feelings.

We're still friends and recently we had a late night talking together on the phone. It was mostly just a catch-up, but eventually I worked up the courage to tell her how speaking with my therapist has helped me gain a better understanding of my emotions and how they relate to some trauma I suffered in my teenage years. I told her how sorry I was for the way I behaved. She started to cry, but in a good way, and told me that she had been spending so much time playing things over in her head, blaming herself and not understanding why I had so much anger inside me. She thanked me many times and it was all very cathartic for both of us.

In a couple of weeks I'll be going to a concert with her. I told her she's welcome to stay at mine that night but she's already booked a hotel instead.
I believe that when a woman has become indifferent to you (in a romantic sense) there's very little that can be done to change her opinion, and I don't want to put her through any more pain than I've already caused. I don't even know how things would work with the distance, and I doubt that she feels the same way as I do. That being said, I truly do believe I've come a long way since we split up and I want to tell her that. I want her to know how I feel about her (even though I expect she already does) and I want her to know how special she is.

They were recently getting out of a relationship and they told me they wanted to be single but they did have feelings for me, and I had feelings for them. Over the next couple of weeks, we did everything that a couple would do in a relationship without the label of an official relationship. Flirty messages, hanging out all the time, physical affection, etc. In terms of physical affection, we never engaged in actual intercourse. It was more like outercourse sex I guess?

A couple of weeks in, we were doing what we usually did in bed. I had noticed that after finishing times before, they would become visibly upset, telling me that they would get a lot of intrusive thoughts (though I don't know what that entailed). That happened again on this day- they became really emotional after finishing. I didn't quite know how to comfort them, times before we would just cuddle and watch tiktoks or something like that. This time, after letting some time pass, I motioned to go down on them. It's important to note that I asked them about whether they were comfortable with that about a week or so before and they said no. I don't know how that escaped my head on this day, but it did. Every time we ever did anything I made absolutely sure to check in with them and ask if they were okay with what was happening. From what I can recall, this day was no different. I started kissing down in that area, trying to notion to them that I'd like to do that for them.

I remember them pulling their panties to the side, and I started. A few times throughout, they would stop me and tell me that ""it felt good"" but they were worried about being late to a concert we were going to later that night. I interpreted this as ""I like what's happening but I'm not sure if we have time"" instead of ""I would like this to stop now,"" evidently a major error on my part. Afterward, they told me they didn't like what happened and eventually after a few weeks, they told me what I did ""had a name"" and they cut off contact with me.

After it happened, they said they didn't like what happened and we talked about it. I told them I was sorry for violating their sexual boundaries- regardless of whether what happened should be considered sexual assault, I know I was still in the wrong. I hurt them, something I never thought I'd be capable of doing. It wasn't intentional, but intentions don't matter in the grand scheme of things. I've talked to a therapist about this and so have they. My therapist believes this was a matter of miscommunication. I'm not sure what their therapist said, but from what I understand, if their therapist believed that I committed sexual assault then I would have to be reported (according to my therapist).

There's more I could say about how they kept me around after it happened, telling me that they didn't want a relationship with anyone but still wanted to cuddle with me and show some affection. I asked them if they ever thought it would work out between us and they told me that they didn't want to say yes but didn't want to say no. They told me that they ""liked that I liked them."" After they cut me out of their life, I saw that they were going on dates with other people, had crushes on multiple people, signed up for dating apps, etc. That made me feel very used and manipulated like they only wanted to keep me in their life because they knew I had feelings for them and they were afraid of being alone. This doesn't really pertain to the nature of the post, but I was curious if these behaviors maybe link to how they reacted to what happened? It's a stretch, I just don't want to leave out any details.

I'd appreciate any and all advice. If there are any resources you know of that would help educate me on consent and such so that this doesn't happen with anyone else in the future, that would be great. Thanks.

I’ve been with my boyfriend for 8 years, coming up on 9 next year. We went to middle school, high school and college together, and started dating since we were 16 and we are now both 24. We have been living together since April. I went through a lot of trauma because of him, and I feel like s lot of it is leading to depression, anxiety and indecision. He has verbally abused me in the past because of mistakes I have made and has made me feel self-conscious about my appearance and personality. 

He grew up with a dad who is narcissistic, angry all the time, verbally abused him and yelled at him all the time for things that weren’t his fault, then acted as if everything was okay the next day. His mom gave/gives him a lot of love and tried to tell him to accept his dad the way he is and that he loves him so that he could still have a father figure, making it seem like this behavior was okay. His dad then went on to blame his mom for the bad relationship he has with his kids. 

Anyway, I try to have compassion for him because of his childhood but I feel so resentful about all of the times he has hurt me. I don’t understand how someone who loves you can treat you that way. In the past, it has taken hours for me to get though to him and for him to apologize for anything. He used to get angry really easily and take it out on me. He would just shut down and not say anything, and lack empathy. I often have thought that he has a level of narcissism and selfishness especially when he is angry that made me hate him. Many times, I have been at the point of breaking up with him, but I didn’t because of the affection and love he gave me outside of the verbal abuse. There was a glimmer of hope that things would get better because he would apologize and honestly, and I maybe was not strong enough to break up with him. It wasn’t all bad, there were times when he showed me how much he loved me and it was intoxicating. He has been there for me when my grandma and cousin passed away and many other times in my life. The times we weren’t fighting were great for the most part.

Another part of our relationship is that he feels so much lust for other women that it has lead him to ask for an open relationship in the past and ask for things that I don’t want to do, like threesomes with one of my friends. He struggles with being attracted to other women and i also feel that he has made me feel bad about my body before. He has told me that he feels like he can’t live without having sex with other women but is trying to for me. I see him check out women when we go out and it’s just a constant reminder of this and it makes me angry and sad. And he also wants me to initiate sex more even though I have a lower sex drive, and probably don’t want to have sex because I am resentful towards him about all of these things. From what I know, he has never cheated on me and has said he never will so obviously that matters a lot. 

Before, even despite all of this, it was like I was addicted to him, being sad when he wasn’t there and stopping all of my other interests. He always wanted me to be with him and next to him, which made me feel happy but ended up leaving me without my a lot of my own friends and life. I feel like I have lost my identity and I feel like a shell of a person that I was. I also feel like my perception of women has been skewed, as I am jealous of the fact that he finds them attractive and can only think that maybe he wants to have sex with them. It hurts when he compliments other women and even his friends and family as I feel like he takes me for granted. It almost prevents me from making my own friends as I’m afraid he will be attracted to them. I hate the fact that I am jealous and like this because I just want to support other women and make friends like I used to.

Now, over the past 2 or 3 years, we have talked about all of this and he has apologized multiple times for his behavior and is going to therapy. Since I moved in or even before, I have so much anxiety every day I wake up. I feel so angry at him and my mind is constantly bringing up things he has done to wrong me in the past. Our lives, our friends, and even our families are so intertwined that I know it will be really hard if we break up. I also know how much it will hurt both of us when we do break up, as we are really close. My heart hurts because he is trying really hard to be happy with me, and is treating me so much better, listening to me, and trying to ignore his urges for other women. 

Despite this, my depression and anxiety has worsened because all I think about it is this dilemma of whether we should break up or not/take a break. I don’t feel happy with my family or friends as I’m thinking about this all the time, and trying to explain of this to them is hard for me. I feel that it’s right to move out and take a break and then figure out later if we want to get back together, so I can find myself again and so we both can try dating other people, but I also can’t imagine him or myself with other people. It hurts me to think about him being with someone else romantically and sexually, but I feel that it’s still the right thing to do. I am tired of feeling like a burden and preventing him from living his life and fulfilling his desires, and I don’t want him to regret it one day. And I don’t want myself to regret not seeing what it’s like to live alone and heal.

Unfortunately, the place we moved in to he owns - renovated this place with our designs in mind. He can afford it if I move out, but I feel really guilty about it because it will be expensive for him and all I wanted to do before this was move in with him, as I thought it would make a lot our problems go away. I also would have to move out a lot of my furniture and kitchen stuff, which would leave him to buy his own things.

We grew up together since we were 16, so this is really hard for me. I feel like I am losing a part of myself and my best friend. He is the person that knows me more deeply than anyone and has seen me be my true self more than anyone else, so it feels really hard to let that go. It’s like we have our own language, and it feels so painful to lose that. But I feel as if I have no choice anymore because of my depression, jealous and anxiety at the thought of our relationship.

My question is - has anyone ever been in a situation like this and does it get better? Can you get over resentment that you feel in your body? Will his lust ever get better or is this just hopeless? Is a break the best decision for us? Should I try everything I can first to make this work, and am I just throwing away something good? How do I tell if it’s just me that’s depressed or this relationship is causing it?

I wear my heart on my sleeve, and it kills me. If I suspect someone doesn’t want to talk anymore, it eats away at me and I get in such a depressed mood, anxious, etc. 

I know it’s not healthy. I understand it’s an issue. I realize it’s not fair for myself and especially them and those around me. Alright, now what? There’s nothing that I can do that’s an easy fix. I’ve been trying to “fix” this for almost a decade I think. Therapy wouldn’t help, it’s not something I can talk through. I’m strongly against any drugs, even though I know they would “fix” it probably. 

The truth is, I strongly enjoy that feeling of a strong connection. It’s the *disconnection* that screws me over. I don’t want to lose that 1st part… getting over people easily would only be possible if the strong feelings were negated to begin with. 
I’d say it’s difficult for me to form bonds like that, but it isn’t. It’s the easiest thing in the world for me. And it’s so strong. 

I’m a very genuine person, extremely empathetic, constantly working on self improvement… but I certainly have my flaws, and this is one of them. I don’t consider it a flaw typically, but anything that can make me feel like this has to be one. I’ve changed a lot about me, but this specific thing eludes me.

Firstly, I have to say I was a virgin when I met him. Back then I wasn’t looking for the love of my life to go over it, nor was I looking for someone to just fk. 

When I met him, for the first time in my life I felt physical attraction towards someone. We met through some common friends dancing one night. I asked him out like a week later and we fked rlly early in the relationship (not the first date) since then we see each other at least a week, sometimes we only go for coffee close to our houses but it almost every time leads to having sex. 

At the begging I never thought it could become something more than just sex, manly because of the age difference, especially for my age. I truly believed he only wanted to fk me and I was completely ok with it, bc I wanted the same, just to do it with someone I found attractive.

However, everything got so complicated for me, I’m aware I have really low self steem and I’m insecure. I’m afraid to know (confirm) that he only wants to have sex with me because I’m convenient. I mean I almost always say yes when he wants to see me and we basically never text. At the beginning, he texted me more and showed more interest in my day, but in the last month he lets me on seen for hours/day and doesn’t ask for my well being. However I remember in the early days I told him I didn’t rlly texted with a lot of people and maybe he got the idea I didn’t want him to. Also, I told him that bc he always seemed so confident and independent that I though it could attract him more. 

A week ago when he was leaving me in my home I saw that his ex texted him (he broke up with her) and it was like an ongoing chat bc she sent like a lot of messages, but yesterday the chat was deleted (she’s in another country).

I was having a bad time before a met him, I felt really depressed and still am, but when I’m alone with him I always have a good time. However I’m just so afraid to be completely me, so I keep quiet and just listen to what he says. Which also makes me afraid to look boring and remember him even more about our age difference. 

Deep inside I know he doesn’t want to be my boyfriend but I just want to be honest with my feelings, even though I’ll miss the connection, the sex and him. Should I just keep quiet and enjoy while it last? Or be upfront and ask him if he at least can be there for me more? 
Maybe I should just ask him if we could keep it physical, it’s just that when I’m with him he’s so affectionate and is always smiling and just, I like him so much. I wasn’t ready to feel this for another person and now it seems it won’t last.

I’m going away for 2 weeks for the holidays and I feel it could be a good time for him to let me down easily and just forget about me. Maybe I should just end all of it today?

We planned to be engaged sometime post thanksgiving of this year ( we decided on an engagement party this weekend after thanksgiving) and the time and location of the proposal and the large after-party were going to be a surprise for me. We had been discussing this for a year and my parents and all my family members were told that an engagement was coming in november. My bf and I are both indian (I'm from an extremely conservative religious family even tho I'm not myself) and engagements are something that is discussed with the family and approval is absolutely needed. Everything was set and I had given my bf an engagement party guest list for my side so he could invite them and we had gone ring shopping multiple times so he knew exactly what I wanted. I bought 2 gowns for this event and was giddy for literally months. I was so excited for this moment and I felt like I had been ready to move our relationship forward because I knew he was the one. I loved him so much. ALso,we had just gotten a dog together and had been co-parenting for a couple of months. We dont live together (because of my ultra-conservative family) but live a short walk away from eachother. We had discussed getting married in 2 years with a long engagement. Throughout the past at least 6 months- I would verify with him NUMEROUS times to ensure that an engagement was actually happening and I wasnt just getting my hopes up. I finally sensed he was getting cold feet a couple of weeks before and confronted him and of course- he tells me he's not ready and its not,me it's him. I HAD to call each and every single person of my friends on my list and tell them that the party was off because it took him until the last second to even cancel it and took him even longer to muster up an apology text to any of them. He had to reimburse multiple flights tickets because people from all over the country were flying into manhattan for this. It was beyond humiliating for me to have to deal with this and he claims to still want to be with me but marriage could be years down the line with no timeline given. I just need some sort of a commitment from him- I'm not trying to wait forever and I've made that clear. He's killed all hopes and dreams that I had about a proposal and I'm trying not to care about that because in the end- a happy engagement and marriage is more important than any party but it truly is devastating and humiliating. I have never had a birthday party or any event where people actually did anything for me so this stung even more to have any hope of that crushed. My friends all hate him now and dont want anything to do with him anymore and give me attitude for even staying with him. I dont even know how I feel. How should I even move forward?

Happy to listen to advice though :)

Every Women I meet, and everyone that I date say the same thing...  
Its almost to the point where I feel like I could write a script, hand it to them after 3 weeks and ask, ""is this what you're about to say?""

The most recent girl 26F. My word what a time.  
I received some information from a few friends who met this girl at the pub, she works nearby and had been stood up two weekends in a row, from two different people. They all said we would be a good match.  
I took the chance, called her work place and asked her out for a drink, the whole phone call was sweet and charming. She hesitated (Naturally) and gave me her phone number instead. I sent her a txt with who I am, what I do and what I like. She responded almost instantly and the first date was set.

Purely blind we were both very nervous of course, but we hit it off and hit the ground running.  
She and I, both didn't want the night to end. I asked for a 2nd date, she agreed, I gave her a kiss on the cheek and waited patiently until next time.

We cooked dinner at my place, we both love to cook!  
It was wonderful, we were both laughing and carrying on like little kids with a crush.  
I told her I'd like to kiss her, she said yes please.  
We watched some TV, we snuggled, made out etc etc.  
It was clear she really liked me, the whole time she would be smiling at me, getting closer and leaning in for kisses.

3rd date - Night markets followed by drive-in cinemas. I have a wagon so I kit out the back with pillows and all that.  
This was great, we barely watched the movie, all she did was watch me between making out.

4th date, she came for dinner at mine again.  
We had sex and it was glorious, she said things like ""that's never happened before,"" and I feel so comfortable with you, she stayed the night and slept in my arms.

The next day she invited me to her house, (I miss you, I want to see you, so on so fourth) the weather was horrendous was basically ""Netflix and chill."" I stayed the night and the one after.  


This is where I come to my header.  
3 Days later, we were supposed to have dinner, she didn't really say yes or no but mentioned she would see me regardless.

Hits me with the whole;  
You're great, the dates were romantic, your attractive, thoughtful, interesting, good in bed. Basically everything a man wants to hear was said.  
BUT; ""I don't think I want this""...  
I offered space and let 10 days go by before reaching out.  
We hung out again and its very obvious that the spark went away...

Every Women, every damn girl, every time.  
For me it always goes from 0-100 over a week or two then back to 0 over the period of 1 or 2 days. They always tell me how great I am, they always say they had a great time. They always and never want to progress further.  
I didn't love bomb, I knew I liked her, but being early times I, myself am still trying to figure it out if I want to progress.  
I just feel as though I never get the chance to figure it out and always make it clear I want to. But I always get closed off before I get the opportunity.  


Now, I haven't seen many posts like this one. I have lots of ""success"" when it comes to securing dates and having good times. But I'm wondering if there is anyone like me who gets similar interactions.  
It's beginning to feel pointless, its tiring, and groundhog day is really getting to me.

Then we had a walk and in the end he requested me a taxi to get home. After I got home, we followed up and both thanked each other for a great evening. 

To me, I’d like to communicate more with him and I would even not mind going and visiting him in his city but I haven’t heard from him for a day.

Straight away we were talking pretty much non stop for hours everyday and I had never felt such an interest in someone before. We just had so much in common with eachother including music which has very much been a big part of my life and we both shared that as he is a musician (or said he was whether that is true or not we will never know)

Feelings started to develop which I tried to avoid happening as I have never wanted to date someone online especially when I wasn't looking for a partner and was just looking for a friend and someone to discuss daily life with. However despite my better judgement we started dating.

There were signs that I should have seen, like he wouldn't call me or send videos and that is a typical tell tale sign that you are being catfished.

These pictures dating back to a year ago sometimes older. Videos on this guys account of him talking and singing. My heart sank realising I had been catfished, after confiding with someone I thought I knew and trusted.... it was all a massive lie. My bf (for lack of a better word) admitted he made these accounts to stalk an ex and had no intention of talking to people on them or that it wouldn't have gotten that far but it got out of hand and he could never tell me. Everything was just a massive lie

So recently started a new a job and I(M25) work quite closely with Jane (F29) and we get along like a house on fire.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is this is that we do genuinely flirt back and forth with each other and I suspect she might have a thing for me (I had to double check because I am tone deaf to romantic stuff) the only issue she has a boyfriend, yikes I know.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this isn't friendly work place flirting like I thought at first but it's slowly getting more and more serious, play fighting and showing her body off to me in off hand comments e.g look how short my skirt is etc etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I wont lie she genuinely helps me get through the tougher days at work and she just makes my days better when we pop jokes off at each other.

&amp;#x200B;

The kicker to this situation is that I have essentially had no romantic experiences for the past two years due to my past relationship and covid-19 so I'm essentially like a teenager with his first crush again.

&amp;#x200B;

Now honestly I don't want to do because I feel bad, I mean I've been on the reverse end of this situation but I keep telling myself it's not my issue and I just carry on flirting back and well I may have started to catch feelings. real well done there.

Hey y’all, so I’m very new to dating and I got hinge a few months ago. 

The one thing I’m superrrrr insecure about is my acne! I used to have very clear skin and the pictures on my hinge profile reflect that. It was about a month or two ago where I started getting acne on my cheeks out of nowhere. I went to the dermatologist and I’m now on medication for it. My acne flare up has stopped but there’s still red marks on my cheeks (a few on my left cheek and a lot on my right). Especially for someone who never really struggled with acne, this is now my biggest insecurity. They’re starting to fade away but it could take a long time to see actual progress. At thanksgiving my grandma made a comment about how bad it looked LOL 💀 And I don’t like wearing a lot of makeup, I usually stick to tinted moisturizer, mascara, and concealer at the very most. Even with all that my acne is still visible.


And my teeth for the most part is fine, but I have mild crowding on my lower teeth. I’m starting Invisalign next week and the total treatment will take about 4 months. Yeah Invisalign trays are clear but I mean they’re still noticeable. And I’m getting attachments which are these things that stick on your teeth and it’s not subtle at all.


And then my weight… I’m 5’5” and 130 lbs, so I’m in a healthy range, but I’m currently on a diet, trying to get to 115-120 lbs. I used to be 120 but I’ve gained around 10 lbs this past year. My pictures on hinge make me appear really slim but I’m honestly not as slim as I used to be— a few of my pics are a year old. 


Idk I’m not typically an insecure person but I’m new at dating so all these changes on my body and face are making me nervous. I look pretty decent on my profile, so I’m afraid that when guys see me in person they’ll be disappointed. And this one guy I’m talking to I really like, I’d hate for him to reject me because I’m not what he thought I was. I want to project confidence but it’s hard for me to fake it. Gahhhhh idk I could use some words of wisdom rn.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1130735,public,self,"Insecure about my (20s F) acne, Invisalign, and weight :(",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/r4haup/insecure_about_my_20s_f_acne_invisalign_and_weight/,no_ads,0,

Everyone’s pain is real and people do terrible things to other people. I’m sorry for people’s heartbreak, I’m always heartbroken, and that’s okay. I know that means that I’m capable of great love. And deserving of great love. Finding that great love sometimes leads you to others that change your perspective on what love can be. Sometimes that’s negative. But I know somewhere in there, there will have been a beautiful moment. When you look back on the past with a lover, remember the positive moments that make you smile, laugh or cry. It’s okay. It’s in the past now. If you find yourself overthinking about past mistakes, terrible injustices or lost lovers
If you must spend time reflecting on the past, focus only on the positive moments. Purge the regret and hatefulness that haunts you from the past and release the stress and burden of those memories that keep coming up. You can leave the past behind you. Move forward and up to a better opportunity to find your person that really gets you. That great love, that I know, everyone deserves, (if that’s what you’re looking for). 

Ive had many women come in and out of my life. We’ve split for many reasons. I loved every one of them. That love was always different. I learned many lessons and I am still learning them. The past has taught me a lot. Reflection is important but do not dwell and sulk in revenge of your past mistakes. 
I’m better than that. 
And so are you. 
The present is upon us. What are we going to do with today? 
Consequently, I love dating quiet a bit, for the very fact, that I’m lucky enough to be cute enough that some women, sometimes, astonishingly to me, actually want to date me. It’s definitely an advantage to be attractive, that’s obvious. 
I still believe that everyone deserves to find that person(s) that truly understands them. Wants to support them and wants to love them. 
I think everyone deserves to find their great love, so get vaccinated, get out there and go find them. 
Take the presence of mind with you.

Anyways back in middle school or even high school, seeing my crush or any girl that I really liked in general gave me this “spark”. It’s almost like butterflies in my stomach in a way, it gave me a drive to do my best and ask out that girl. Today though in my mid twenties I just don’t have that spark anymore, after so much rejection growing up I either just don’t feel that same feeling looking at someone I like as I did before. Usually these days if I see anyone I find generally attractive, I simply just approach in a friendly manner and keep it that way. Even if a woman gives me signs of affection I simply take it normally but I’m usually unsure of how to respond.

It sounds weird I know. So is it possible to lose such a feeling? Maybe that “right” person just hasn’t come around yet?

I’d say conversation was going pretty nice and we had a lot in common. There was no sexual context or things like that, but I feel like there was chemistry. Then we had a walk and in the end he requested me a taxi to get home. After I got home, we texted each other via messenger  and both thanked each other for a great evening.

Our conversation on the dating app was decent, we had a nice level of connection.

Hello i will try my best to explain the situation as good as possible to not come out weird. ( i am a man that is 20)

I have a friend lets call her Anna, Anna and I are friends for quite some time, close to two years with the friendship becoming stronger the last one year. For clarity it is a long distance friendship, not strange of me as i have a couple of long distance friends as i do with short (i guess?) distance friends. But our friendship is great with chatting being very often and when we have time we do video calls.

We decided to do a part of holidays together and i will go visit her for the first time and   we are super excited about it. The thing is i kind of like her, she is definitely attractive in terms of my tastes and obviously an amazing friend. We are both open with each other and talk about everything including sexual stuff what we like etc haha. 

Now the thing is i would love to do something with her, she has mention she would may have sex with me though I am not exactly her type and there are definitely times that there is a lot of sexual tension between us. So with this in mind i would like to give a try. 

The problem is i have no idea how, i do not wanna make her uncomfortable. We will be about a week together most of the time we will be in her home but we decided we can go about 2 days alone in a hotel and show me some night life and try make me drink 😂 as she likes drinking. Now all things consider how should I approach this? She is the type that likes build up flirting. She is fine in engaging in casual sex. Now if it was not for her telling me if she is horny she would not mind having sex with me i would be more hesitant. The time will be limited so I would need to be fast but also not come out as creepy.

Now I aNOT ASKING FOR manipulative advice! I am just clueless in these type of things before, i had relationships on the past but they were not similar to this situation, more of a serious ones. Now I definitely like her as a friend and i do not wanna fuck up things. I know some will say there is risk and I understand there is risk but i am willing to take it, as long as I minimize the possibility of her freaking out so this is why i am here.

How do I approach this? Both genders advice is welcomed but i am curious about what the girls here have to say. I wanna build up the right mood over a period of week, my weak point is being a shy guy and a bit of introvert but i have find myself being less when I speak in English which is not my mother tongue, which is the language we will communicate in. She likes dynamic man so I do not want to fuck up by being social awkward at the start. All of my exes have told me I have a nice Aura, and I am able to charm them when i speak, but I have no idea how to do it actively.
I have ZERO experience with the whole casual/going out and have a drink thing. I have no idea how to take things from there, any advice? No matter how silly it sounds it will be useful. My friends seem to find it so natural, they told me it is a matter of how you lead things, having fun make her open up perhaps doing some erotic hints.

We are both 20 so more times than not silly types of flirting help a lot in our age group. Since Corona my social interactions are fucked up though, how i do this whole flirting thing😂, honestly if someone gives me a good answer to that I swear i will own you everything haha. Jokes aside i hope you understand an answer on how to lead things would be helpful!( even better if it has some details =) )

GIRLS (and maybe boys haha) i have deep respect on her so ideas on how to be smooth and not creepy will be so helpful. I wanna avoid turning things weird as much as possible. If anything i wanna unlock any desire she may have and go from there. I am on an age that I understand that trying to manipulate is pointless, and will just turn back on me. I hope you believe me that I approach this with love and respect.

TLDR Introvert wants to learn how to flirt and perhaps do some things*cough* with his extrovert friend.

P.S a full relationship is not the point  of the question, we are long distance and it will be too difficult, especially for her.

I got in my bus and there were two very attractive girls, one was looking at me and when I looked back... same thing happened. And I caught her looking at me more than once.

Here's the thing, I like to think that I'm decent looking, just an average 5'7 Indian guy, with not a fit body. But, I try and dress nicely. I've been told I have a good dressing sense, and that I like to be nicely groomed, have good good perfume on... and present myself in a good way. Basically, I try.

I have struggled with my self image and I beat myself up a lot for not being ""good enough"" and all that shit.

And I still can't believe that it was possible. I mean it did happen and has happened earlier too. It's just... I still have such a hard time allowing myself to believe that something like this could happen to me too.

Should I start a conversation? And if yes, how? How do I react to this?

They don't look very open though, but they stare and look away. I'm confused.

I am writing this because I would love to hear some of your thoughts about the situation I am in, and vent it out a bit so forgive me for details and being a long-winded story-teller. Let's start with some context about myself and my stand on relationships.

I am a young woman and art student based in West-Europe. I think of myself as a quite active, merry, enthusiastic person and easily make contact with people whilst also being very withholding, introvert, protective of my independence at the same time. I have had some interesting relationships in the past and I still run into great people whom I could potentially date with. But because of the amount of energy it costs that could otherwise go to figuring out what I want, experimenting, investing in my art and studies I have decided to not actively engage. Second, I do not easily like people. But I always said ''If it happens and it feels right, I am open for it!''

Alright, so, recently I have been scrolling through my Instagram page where I network with people that all have the same passion for certain artistic subjects. It's quite a lovely scene as everyone from all over the place seems to kind of know each other in the industry. I have been following this quite random guy Adam on the platform. Adam is student and actor and plays in short movies about subjects similar the paintings and art I make. Adam also has the same ethnic roots as myself (also 3rd generation) which is always interesting. He had been posting about a documentary project he was involved as an actor/creator in Israel-Palestine. These posts led to some small conversations of me commenting on ''Ah, you should go to that place afterwards!'' or him talking about his experience, me sharing an Arabic poem about Jerusalem's laundry waving in the wind. All the context from above made it feel very safe to speak to this  'stranger'.

When he came back from his travels and had a break and my own project was done too we've spent hours sending each other voice memo's, FaceTiming, sharing certain stories about our lives and recognisable things about our culture in contrast to growing up back here. You've might have experienced it, staying up late at night, immediate responses, flirting and laughing. 

Even though I shared my stand on relationships and Adam also expressed his avoidant-tendencies. We've both kind of came to a very adult mutual agreement like: ""Well, we vibe like crazy and I think it would be great to meet up. I guess I am open to feel how this feels?"" He lives 2-3 hours away in the country next door so that wasn't too crazy either.

A couple days later an 'actually' very known more senior actor who've won prices in the west, let's call him Ali, sees my work on Instagram because someone that knew him shared it. He said, knowing I was a student, he wanted to exchange a copy of my work for two tickets to his show including two meals (worth a 125 bucks).  The show is about the actor's live as a 3rd generation guy from the same roots growing up in Europe and Adam loved Ali's work. I accepted this offer.

I immediately texted Adam. ''Adam, Adam,'' probably in caps lock. ''You know Ali (lastname)!? He personally gave me tickets for the show tomorrow. Can you make it?'' and as a joke I said ''I don't even know why I asked that! What do you mean -''Can you make it?'' ''Drop everything that's unnecessary and come! Fix a car, this is the city!'''

He expressed that he really wanted to go but unfortunately he had to help his aunt with something and couldn't make it. He appreciated it and seemed very enthusiastic about the offer. He also said he was ''A man of his words!'' in regards to this situation with his aunt.

I say: ''Awh, yes! It was all so random and spontaneous, I know huh. Well, we will see one another some other time then and I don't have to be afraid that I don't get rid of the ticket!''

Since then we didn't really speak anymore, he didn't even text me the next day about how I liked it. After that I attempted to start a conversation because one of his short films got selected into this film festival in the Middle-East which was is nice break-through. 

Ever since it's been quiet. I said I was going to try it again some other day. And that weekend I had to resign from my job without notice together with my two colleagues because of a very weird situation. For the first time in months, I felt like a poor student again without getting paid. After a brief ''Whats up!'' he asked me how I was and I said ''Quite good, but some bullshit happened which threw me off the track a bit! A bit surprised and have to adapt to the situation!'' - Adam responds hours later: ''What happened?'' - I respond hours later ''I think I cannot drop this in text, in case you really want to know: I prefer to speak to you about it over the phone!'' - ''I will call you later at night, but otherwise tomorrow!'' - I agree, stay up until 2 (which for me is something exceptional) and never hear from him. The next day in class I send him a text ''Man of your word?'' and other options to call, he agrees and I say ''I'll just see it popping up. I am available from now until.. this time'' And the day goes by and nothing. Not even ''I cannot make it, in the middle of this thing..'' - and the next day. ''I am at work, when I get home I'll have some food and then I am free.'' - I wait, he sends a voice memo asking something about my day, and when I send him a basic text. ''Can't wait to tell you about what happened this weekend.'' he doesn't respond for another 3 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

My time as an equally busy person did not get respected at all, and I've spend my Saturday night, and the day before just kind of waiting for him while I could have used that time for something else. In the time he ghosted me I send out a message something among the lines of:

 'Hey, I don't think this is super kind. This is not about me being clingy or wanting all of your attention, because we're equally busy with our lives.'' (Boy-girl role dynamic is quite big in his conditioning) ''But this is about your way of communication. I really like you (and I like making time for you despite everyone in the industry wanting something from us) so I am just going to be as direct and honest as possible. But this is not right to me as it takes a lot of mental energy to deal with this and prevents me from planning my day as I actively make time for you when you say you have time to call. I don't want this type of interactions in my life anymore. I don't have the energy for it.'

He responded quite defensive (like ''When I don't respond, I might just actually be busy!'' and more. 

I said:

''I don't think you understand what I am saying. It is not about this. If you want I can try to explain it again or shall we just let this all go?''

''Well, you know. Nevermind, let's let this go.. and I am sorry. Your time is valuable.'' (which is a option because we're barely dating!)

And I responded anyway. ''Dearest Adam, the fact that you are busy is amazing! That is how it should be for a young talented guy like you! Anyone holding you back in that sense, should get the fuck out of your life.'' (Come on, we're in the same boat). ''But this is about communication, Adam. Just simply saying ''Hey I can't make it and showing up when you say so.''. But yes, alright, let's let it go, good luck with what you are doing.''

And that's how it ended. I don't think we'll contact each other again. Am I the Asshole? Do I have a reason to be upset? For me it was lack of initiative and the sudden ghosting?

This is gonna be a little long but I need some outside opinions! 

So I (F21) have known Liam (M20) since end of middle school/beginning of high school. Our families are friends and Liam and I hung out a lot when we were 13-16 ish. When were 16/17 we starting sleeping together (but not dating) over the summer break. It ended poorly and I stopped speaking to him until last year. 

He reached out to me in April 2020 to basically apologize for hurting me when we were younger and he wanted to catch up. I was recovering from surgery at the time and going through a breakup so I accepted his apology but kind of brushed him off. 

Fast forward to December 2020 he reached out again to get a cup of coffee and catch up. We meet up and talk, nothing too deep but it was nice. He told me he would be going into the military soon. He started that shortly after so we were weren't really in contact for a few months. 

Then over the summer 2021 he sends me the most expensive gift off of my Amazon wishlist for my classroom. I reach out to thank him and we actually started speaking again. Texted a bunch and it felt like no time had passed between us. While were were texting and stuff he ended up confessing that he had feelings for me in high school but was nervous to say anything, and I told him that I felt the same way. 

 A few weeks later he came into town before being stationed. We went out to dinner and he paid, yet kept mentioning that dinner was ""just platonic"" almost like he was trying to convince himself. He complimented me and made a few jokes that I should just come with him to where he was being stationed then we parted ways. 

He recently came back to visit for Thanksgiving. We planned on going out and doing something while he was here but we both ended up under the weather for a few days. So an actual date didn't happen, we just took it easy at home together. We ended up sleeping together and spoke constantly. When he was over, he had one drink and started going on and on about how we should date long distance and that he's always thought about it. He stayed the night and was super affectionate. We said how nice it is to be talking again and that we really like spending time together and he told me if I ever find myself where he's stationed (across the country from me) to let him know. Before he left he more directly stated that I should come and visit him, and he said he was serious. And that next time he's in town he's taking me to dinner. 

So that's where we left things. Honestly I just needed to write things down to get them out of my head. I have feelings for Liam and would consider going, but only if I knew he felt the same way. One person in my family is saying that he probably just wants me to go out there to have sex with me and he doesn't have feelings, I'm just convenient. Another person says the opposite, that he definitely is into me and that's why he invited me out there. 

So I don't know. I haven't asked him how he feels because I don't want to lose our friendship. Should I tell him how I feel?

Maybe it's because it's worked in the past, but now I don't know how to enjoy myself unless there are cute girls to talk to. 

I think that's problematic because probably not everyone is as date-hungry as I am. I've also been called out for my behavior by store employees/security, although in my mind, I still rationalize that it was uncalled for because I eject out of the situation after getting rejected and you can't blame a guy for trying. I also think people are just overly sensitive nowadays and being ""uncomfortable"" isn't grounds for calling me out on my behavior. 

Or maybe I am just overly forward and too aggressive so that's why I came here to seek reddit's opinion.

For reference, I see someone and within a few seconds I stop them and say ""Excuse me, I just had to come up and say Hi, I'm theyuta."" Then if they introduce themselves back, I'll ask them if they like X or Y thing that I'm also into. If that works, then I grab their number and ask them out on a date later. I'll do this at the grocery store, cafe, conventions, bars, etc. Most of the time though, I'll go out just to look for girls to approach.

Dates are generally doing something fun around town, don’t often involve drinking or sex.
