The problem was that he was moving away for the summer (approx 4 months).

I decided to tell him over text that I caught feelings for him and he told me that he was still a little numb from his last relationship ( a very serious 4 year one) as we meet 2 months later if his break up. 

Im sad but there is nothing to do about it, this was planned before me. 

I know when he comes back or during he will message me. I plan to no respond when he’s out of the state but I’m not sure when he comes back. Things ended so gracefully. 
I won’t wait around though, but I don’t know what I will do if he comes back around.

What are the circumstances that I should let him back in?

5,mxtqia,1619300632,A guy at my gym seems to like me!,"Hello reddit,

So, I want to keep it short: there's a guy at my gym that seems to be into me. He hadn't shown up at the gym for 4 months, until last week. Before that, we had never really talked but greeted each other. 

Last week, when I saw him again, we chatter for a bit and I asked him for his name. He seemed very happy to see me again and tried to make some conversation.

After that, this week we have seen each other twice on the street (I live right in front of my gym, so we've seen each other on our way in/out). He stopped me to chat each time and gave me a kiss on my cheek as greeting (not weird in my country, but a bit weird because covid). 

I never see him alone. Mostly, because he has a twin brother and they are always together, so I feel a bit awkward talking to him with his brother next to him (who never really talks to me). 

So, I don't know how I'd ask him for his number or try to talk a little more.

On the other hand: going to the gym for the past 6-7 months is like, the best part of my day. So I'm afraid if things go sour with this guy, it'd make things uncomfortable. 

My dating life hasn't been that good, honestly, and I'm really scared of things actually turning reaaally bad.

Is it normal to have a post mortem or two and discuss how the argument got so out of hand? Or should we just move past it? 

Should we both apologize to each other? Or just drop it?

Is it concerning when a partner uses a lot of accusatory statements rather then ""I"" statements during to post mortem? Even after being asked to stop because its not productive and not objective.

14,mxulqr,1619303310,"Girl from Bumble says she just wants to be friends for now, hints at possibly dating in the future?","So I started talking to this girl off Bumble about 2.5 months ago. She actually put effort into conversations early on, which was a nice surprise. A couple weeks in on our 2nd ""date"", I asked her what her intentions were, and she said she's got a lot going on right now and couldn't offer much, so for the next few months she's just looking for friends, which was disappointing, but I'm also fine with it, because she is cool to hangout with. 

From what other guys said, I figured she was just letting me down easy and not even serious about the friends part, but in the two months since, we have been hanging out at least once a week, sometimes twice. And now she's talking about driving me around the country next month on a camping trip, so suffice to say she is at least serious about being friends. Two weeks ago, I asked again if she would be open to potentially dating, and got mostly the same response; she says she isn't in the right headspace for a relationship, but said she ""wouldn't be opposed to it in the future, maybe in a few months"", and would let me know if she ever decides she wants to date me. She then said ""but don't wait for me.""

Well, I guess my question is, do any of you think she is serious about potentially dating me, or is she just saying that? Is it possible that she actually is interested, or could be in the future? The ""but don't wait for me"" line makes me think not.

A little dismissive of what my experience has actually been but maybe there’s some truth to that even though I’m pretty sure I’ve picked up some basic interpersonal skills along the way even w/o being in a relationship.

I don’t like that first dates come with an assumption of romantic interest when the person is a total stranger.

I want a way to say let’s just get coffee or something and figure out if we want to date later without just confusing them. 

Like I get it’s a dating app, but it’s not in person. I’d like to meet them in person before we decide what type of relationship this is even if it doesn’t go past one date. 

It’s less awkward to meet someone as friends, a platonic meeting, then let the interaction evolve from there.

32,mxwokc,1619310089,Overwhelmed by finally trying to make an effort,"So this may come off a bit as rant-y since my thoughts are a bit jumbled.  I imagine stories like these are common but I felt the need to share anyway.  

I'm 25M and never really put myself out there in regards to dating or anything romantic (the spare few times where I did were not successful), but I am trying to make an effort as of late and am feeling a bit overwhelmed. This effort has been constrained to apps like Tinder and Bumble as I don't really know how exactly to meet people and connect in person.  However, I find these apps aren't exactly making me confident or better about myself.  Plus the ease of rejection and lack of responses on these apps is taking a toll on me emotionally to be honest. But if I delete them, I'm pretty much shutting myself out to this world and committing myself to further loneliness, which isn't exactly what I'd like to do!  I have recently gone to both the Tinder and Bumble subs and got decently positive feedback about my profile, yet that doesn't seem to translate into matches.  I'm in fairly good shape and I'm not in dire straits or anything in regards to my life, so I don't think I really need to do any material overhaul of my life in order to start dating, but there is a strong mental block that has been in the way for a long time.

There is this feeling that due to the fact that I missed out on a period of development that most went through, I am handicapped when it comes to this stuff.  I feel as though I'm pretty poor at engaging in small tall and initiating conversation.  I'm trying to figure out how to move forward because this has been a major aspect that is missing from my life, but I constantly feel the desire to just give up and throw in the towel.  Its hard not to feel self-conscious about the fact that I can't seem to have another person see me as attractive and worth their time.  I know that people develop at different stages, but the fact that I'm 25 and have never been on a date or hooked up with anyone is something that makes me feel like there is something innately wrong with me.

I know this is probably coming off as self-loathing, and I'm really not trying to say ""woe is me, please pity me"".  I just can't seem to figure out how to engage in something that appears so natural to many others and it makes me feel inadequate.  We are social creatures and I know that being able to accomplish this would be fulfilling, I just don't know how to not beat myself up over this and feel a sense of loss over what I didn't do growing up.

This effort has been constrained to apps like Tinder and Bumble as I don't really know how exactly to meet people and connect in person. The ease of rejection and lack of responses/matches on these apps is taking a toll on me emotionally to be honest. But if I delete them, I'm pretty much shutting myself out to this world and committing myself to further loneliness, which isn't exactly what I'd like to do! I'm in fairly good shape and I'm not in dire straits or anything in regards to my life, so I don't think I really need to do any material overhaul of my life in order to start dating, but there is a mental block that has been in the way for a long time.

There is this feeling that due to the fact that I missed out on a period of development that most went through, I am handicapped when it comes to this, as I feel completely out of my element when I engage in this. I'm trying to figure out how to move forward because this has been a major aspect that is missing from my life, but I constantly feel the desire to just give up and throw in the towel. I know that people develop at different stages, but the fact that I'm 25 and have never been on a date or hooked up with anyone is something that makes me feel self-conscious and sense of loss.

I apologize if this came of as a rant or overly self-loathing, but this has been bothering me as of late and I feel lost.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/mxxel1/overwhelmed_by_finally_trying_to_put_myself_out/

54,mxz6dk,1619318829,Would like some advice for my current situation with someone I've been seeing,"So I (19M) matched with someone (20F) about two months ago. the night that we started talking, I proposed a date. She agreed. The first date we agreed on had to be rescheduled so we went a week later. It went well, talked for several hours. I thought she was funny while I made her laugh as well. Then I proposed a second date a couple days later, and she agreed. Said she'd let me know if she can follow through. That day comes, I ask her about it, we postpone to next week. 

That week we had our second date. This time lasted even longer, we were definitely getting more comfortable with each other. Gave her a hug when we left 8 hours later. 

Then I proposed a date a couple days later, asking if she wanted to come over and introduce me to superhero movies (she's a big fan of superheroes). She excitedly agreed on a day. That day came around and she says she is very tired and naps instead. She suggested next week. I agreed.

Next week we have our third and most recent date. We watch a movie and cuddle, then just lay in my bed talking an holding each other for like 8 more hours after the movie. 

I noticed that throughout, there were a couple mentions of her leaving. After the movie, she said ""I should probably get going *soon* to have dinner with my roommates"". We continued talking for a while after that. Then when it started getting dark, ""I should probably get home before it gets dark"". Continued talking after that as well. We were pretty much non-stop talking and laughing together for 8 hours after the movie, and she finally decided to leave at like 12am. At this point I was just trying to fall asleep with her, gently rubbing my arm with her thumb (really enjoyed that lol). 

couple days later, I once again proposed another date. She said she might be able to do that friday, and she'd let me know. Friday comes around and I mention it to her, she says she's too busy but she will be should be able to do next wednesday when her finals die down. I agree.

So now that I've illustrated how things have been going (more info is better, right?), I need some advice. 

I absolutely HATE that I have been the one to propose hanging out. I hate that so much. It seriously makes me question whether or not she's even into me. But then at the same time, she's always the one to start conversation over random stuff over snapchat. Maybe I'm dumb, but I see that as her just finding a way to talk to me, which I like. Then there's her cuddling with me for over 9 hours, when she could've left at any time. Then there's the fact that we're both always laughing when we're around each other. I really enjoy her time and I get the impression that she enjoys mine as well.

I feel like I'm not seeing her nearly as much as I'd like to, and now summer is about to start so we won't see each other for 3.5ish months (assuming we're still talking when we come back to school).

I even made sure I was incredibly direct with her when we finalized next wednesday when she said friday wouldn't work. I said ""I'd like to see you at least once more before we leave, but I'll leave the ball in your park since I'll be available pretty much all of next week."" then she said either  tuesday or wednesday would work, and I said ""Whichever day gives us more time is the option I'm for"".

If she didn't get it yet, I'd hope she gets it now.

If wednesday goes well, I then have the fear of staying in contact over the summer. I'd like to facetime her now and then, but I DREAD being the one to ask about it because I have proposed literally all of our dates (again, I really cannot fully express how frustrating this is due to the mixed signals).

How should I proceed? This was mainly a rant but I'd really like some insight from anyone who shares an experience in any way similar to this.

Our first date was the night we met at a bar with friends and I had actually forgotten her name for like three hours while we were talking. I didn’t think it’d be a big deal that she was also called Natalie but then we started going out about a year and a half ago, moved in together last spring when Covid started, and then my sister had to move in with us about three months ago.

I mean, almost daily we’ll be hanging out or passing and I’ll say “Hey Natalie...” and either the wrong one answers or, worse, they’ll both be like “Yes?” “Yes?” at the same time!

They also both hate being called Nat, which was something else people were suggesting. My girlfriend also hares pet names because she thinks they’re childish or creepy... I mean, it’s sort of weird. Even saying, like, “sis” makes it sound like a creepy porno. It’s a little dehumanizing to call either of them something other than their name. They really don’t want to. Neither of them. Worst of all, they’re good friends now and they spend a lot of time together!

I’ll be on the phone like “Natalie said this.” and the other one will be like “No I didn’t.” Or I’ll be cooking or something and I’ll ask one of them a question and they’ll both answer. Or I’ll be like “Yeah Natalie your food is on the counter” and they’ll both go thinking it’s theirs. Worst of all, they’ve started sharing stuff.

Like I got us Chipotle on the way home from work the other day and they wrote my name on my bowl tin and ‘Natalie’ on my girlfriend’s bowl tin and I left it for her on the kitchen counter and I went to change out of my clothes and when I got back they were sat on the sofa holding it between them each taking turns with the plastic fork. You know how they come with one of those black plastic forks? They just decided to share it! They weren’t being weird about it except that when one of them would put it down, the other would pick it up. It’s not the only time they’ve done something like that.

58,mxz8gc,1619319036,How to be Less Insecure when He has no time?,"Hi everyone. As the title said, how do you deal with someone who has no time for you? Apologies for the messy telling, my mind is running wild.

I was seeing this guy for almost three months now. We met on an app, so it's more of an OLD thing. It was an instant attraction, but lately, we have been having friction. We are in long distance since our workplace are quite far from each other (we are not from US). He is also older than me. Here are some of the issues we have:

1. I like talking about things, but he rarely talks. I love discussions, especially knowing each other, but he rarely open up to me. He did tell me certain important things about himself, although not all. I still have doubts about certain things about him. He tries his best to talk to me. But at times, he just disappears in chats. Which brings me to...

2. He is a very busy person. I understand this, especially with the nature of his job. I don't usually bother him during work hours since I also have a full time job. I send him some random texts during the day which he tries to reciprocate. He also tries to talk to me at night through calls although not always. 

My issue now is that I want more time with him. Even on weekends, he is busy. I understand that too, but I just want him to give me more time. I feel neglected that my insecurities are showing, to the point of being unreasonable. I realize I am being toxic, with me lashing out on him. He is mature enough though to explain circumstances and I feel bad about what I did.

Maybe I really want is for him to give me more time, give me security. I am falling for him, but I am not sure about this. It feels like I am chasing him and desperate for him. I feel like I am demanding for something zi don't have right to. Last night I lashed out at him again, and today was filled of tension. 

What should I do? How to deal with this insecurity and how to tell him what I feel without sounding very demanding?

64,mxzn6d,1619320541,Coronavirus dating: white man and older black female,"I parked my car and looked for a mask. It took awhile, but I found two, put them on, and headed into the supermarket. Personally, I am super careful when I am out it public, not wanting to pass it on to others and I need to check on elderly relatives.

I saw her car before I saw her. It was a red Lexus SUV. I made note of it and heard the door slam. While walking into the market, I looked back to see who the owner was and was struck short by the sight of her: tall, athletic, straight posture, dark skin with short hair, dressed for business with a paint suit and sunglasses. She had on a mask and walked with purpose. Sometimes, rare occasions, you are overwhelmingly attracted to a woman. It happened to me once before, but this was even more intense. I became aware of my breathing, my movements, my need to talk to her and this was seconds after seeing her. Settle down!!

I made a decision to just shop and get out of there. Who wants to get hit on during a pandemic? I started to shop, but her every movement I was conscious of her and I started to analyze. Did she really pick up grapes or did she move there because she saw me reach for the oranges? Ridiculous.

The problem with a supermarket is you are constantly positioning, bouncing into the same people, and sharing the same small space. For someone with their mind running, like me, it leaves plenty of room for interpretation. I ran countless-- what else can I call them?--traps. Waiting in the pasta aisle to see if she, after seeing me, would come down. She didn't.

I was attracted but did not see a way to start a conversation, so I tried to put her out of my mind and headed to check out. While waiting in line, she walked past-- so hot!!-- and headed to the self check out. It was moving faster, so I followed. She beat me and headed out of the store first as I scrambled to catch up. It took a couple of minutes.

When I exited the store, I immediately searched for her car and it was not in the space. Shit! I pushed my cart towards my car. Circling at the top of the lot I noticed a red Lexus coming down the row, the car, like the driver, stood out. 

She approached with me on the passenger side and yelled over ""find everything you were for"". I laughed. We talked. She took off her mask and she was more attractive. To me, she was a straight lightening bolt. We exchanged details. She was older than I thought, 55, but I was not affected. Think Elise Neal. I told her that I was paranoid about the virus. She was,too. ""Let's meet up"" she said after close to 20 minutes of talk after we both get the vaccine. Perfect.

We were chatting today and sex came up. She mentioned that she was gonna wait to have sex with me until I was ready to not use a condom. I’ve always used a condom so this came as a surprise to me. 

Of course my two biggest concerns are 1. Getting her pregnant. Guess what? she is a single mom with a 3 year old kid. So you’d think she’d learn from that. 2. Getting stds. This is a failure on my part but I have not been tested in a long time.

I changed a lot, personality became more outgoing and cared less about things, still cared about others, and I got hotter. All of a sudden a lot of guys, hot guys I never even had in high school, found me attractive. High school guy friends all of a sudden started to reach out to me trying to hang with me one on one. I thought to myself well I'm bound to get a boyfriend now. 

But as I continue getting to know different guys, the ones I genuinely like and click with only want to fuck me. I have evolved so much, I was insecure and have gained so much confidence even with grieving my favourite parent and although I thought I was enough, thought I was worthy of love, these guys keep showing me I'm simply not. 

There is no one to blame but me. I wish I knew what to do to turn this around for me but I am beginning to think maybe this is just what I deserve, maybe this is just how it's gonna be for me. Life isn't fair, I know that with losing some one that didn't deserve to die so young and so harshly. 

 I have always felt like I had so much potential, and I get so close only for it to slip away through my fingers. This guy that led me on for months, playing me, just made this new girl his girlfriend. She looks like me (same features) so it's clear he has a type. I wondered why I wasn't good enough for him to want to cuff. And then I began talking to a more mature guy, better guy overall who asked me ""what we are"" the second time we hanged. It seemed as if he liked me more than I liked him cause I was just going with the flow at that point. He said he wanted friends with benefits and I said that's cool but I don't want that I want more. He quickly told me he was open to a relationship to, how he thought I was really cool and respected me. He asked if I wanted to go on a date next and I said yeah sure. He opened up to me about a lot and we just get along. I've never had this much in common with a guy. I told my friends and they all thought he was gonna be a potential boyfriend. But after that hang out he hasn't reached out much. Which is totally fine, not sure why he had to make it seem like he was so sure of wanting to go out with me. 

Some info about how I act with guys: I match their energy. I am not clingy. I don't put out (I'm a virgin).  We just make out, maybe take my top off but I've never really let it go beyond that cause I'm trying to wait until I have a boyfriend to try other stuff. I just don't see it as worth it to go beyond that if they don't want more than a hook up. Cause I don't want a hook up. But I'm chill and don't NEED a date, we can just get to know each other hanging out first. I try to make convo and keep things interesting. I make them laugh, I always seem to have similar music and movie taste as them. 

Anyways, I'm 21. At my peak in terms of beauty and youth. Life is only getting harder. I have never been desperate for a boyfriend, I have always been focused on myself and family and friends. I have grown to self love myself. I decide to open myself up to getting into a relationship and it simply is not happening. I am a firm believer in if you want something, you get it. You simply do it. But I have proven to myself that with some things, you just can't change what is meant for you and what is not. I feel sick to my stomach. I don't know what to do. What is the point of all my high grades, all my friends, the money I make, the compliments, if I just end up alone with no guy to love me for once. I am not even asking for something long term or ""the one"" I just wanted a boyfriend. 

I have been a lot more aware of how short life is, how short youth is after my parent died. So the fact that I just watch myself, not being able to get a boyfriend at 21, already regretting that I haven't had one earlier, kills me. I want to live right now. Do things I want right now. Because only right now is real. Fuck the future. You can't depend on it. I am running out of time. I have no control, yet over another thing in my life, and it is killing me.

70,my08t8,1619322851,I'm scared to date again (24F),"Hi. \*deep breath\* HERE WE GO! I've had a complex history with men. Early traumatic experiences in 8th grade, hooking up with the guys who had called me ugly a year prior. Lost my virginity to a stranger, because my abusive guy didn't want to have sex with a virgin. Was raped sophomore year of college (2015) by that guy, who said things to me no one should ever hear. Didn't process the trauma, went on to sleep with lots of guys, had lots of panic attacks every time. I've done some therapy, but of course, this kind of thing runs deep. I have a long way to go.

Fast forward to 2019, I met my ex boyfriend. This was my first real relationship and my first real love. We had an on and off thing for about 15 months, but quarantined together and were officially together for 5 months of that. We had an amazing time together and the relationship was incredibly healing for me. We slept together for the first time 2 months after meeting, and he's the first person I've ever really felt sexually safe with. Once I fell in love with him, I practically forgot about my trauma. Of course, that is, until we broke up. The trauma started seeping back in. I also was completely and utterly heartbroken. Honestly, the emotional pain was like nothing I've ever experienced before. The break up was very hard for me. We initally broke up in July 2020, but we didn't stop talking until February 2021. It was a mess.

Well, my life has been a mess. Long story short, this year has been really really hard for me. I got very very sick in July, moved home in November and have had 5 surgeries since then. Basically, my gallbladder was filled to the brim with stones. They removed it and I became very jaundiced and sick because there was a kink in my bile duct. Since then, I've had stenting every 12 or so weeks, plenty of pancreatitis, and it's been very very painful. I'm going to be ok soon, the last operation is coming up, but it's been difficult. My ex was there for me as much as he could be, but we weren't together, and it got really really toxic. Ok I'm getting to the point.

I feel like something is wrong with me. All of my friends want to go out and date right now, but I just... am not interested. I feel like it's maybe because I look at dating through the wrong lens. For some reason, I'm only thinking about the physical aspect, even though my relationship with my ex was so much more than that. But I'm not looking at dating as finding a best friend. I'm viewing it as like... is this person gonna try to have sex with me right away? I don't know if that makes sense. I just feel really ... scared. Even though I don't want to be back with my ex, he's the only person I can see myself being physical with right now... cause he's the only person I ever felt safe with.

I know it's probably partially because I don't feel well and am in pain a lot of the time. Also, I'm currently in my parents house in my small childhood town. I just have this fear that I'm not going to meet someone that I like again. I just feel absolutely terrified to open myself up again. The idea of someone I don't know touching me makes me want to hide under my bed forever. The break up was so painful and I've only recently actually moved on. Like I've been free of heartache for about 1 month. It's just tough like... I know he's out there starting to date, because he doesn't have trauma issues lol I wish I felt excited about dating!

Is there another way to look at dating that will maybe make it feel safer for me?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/my08t8/im_scared_to_date_again_24f/
71,my09at,1619322906,Tired of never having a bf (21F),"Please don't attack me I just want to rant, I don't know who to talk to or what to do at this point. It's crazy when you look back to when you were younger and see who you are now and think to yourself who would have thought. 

I thought my looks may have been the problem concerning getting guys attention in high school. I had lots of friends, stayed out of drama and I am still like this to this day. Very popular with the girls, get along well with people all of sorts. Had guy friends. But mostly I thought I stayed single because I was not allowed to date and was a good girl who felt guilty going behind my parents back.

74,my0pac,1619324613,"Enjoy getting to know people, have fun and get out of your head","Context. I used to be one of those people who desperately wanted to be a relationship. I felt like something was missing - I wanted someone close to be, to hug, to have sex, to share special intimate moments. That want was so strong I found myself imagining futures with people on first dates and investing way more than I should early. Dating was filled with immense highs and lows. 

At the beginning of this year I had a realisation. The label of a relationship honestly meant nothing. It wasn't a good goal. Because it fails to recognise how different people are and how they might serve our lives in various ways. The goal should've been getting to know people and enjoying whatever experiences I could share with them. It should've been finding joy in all aspects of my life (because honestly, life is pretty freaking awesome). 

As soon as I realised that labels and weird personal goals and timelines were whack compared to just experiencing life and taking it as it comes my life honestly changed. I had an incredible fling (something I would've never done before). Then as I was dealing with the natural little low after a fling (you need some lows to enjoy the highs), an incredible guy came into my life. I knew and he knew that I didn't NEED anyone, but I still see the value in good people.

I let myself just experience getting to know him. I took time. I didn't and haven't looked far ahead. One month in and it's fun and easy. And you know what I couldn't give a flying fuck about labels or what happens. I'm just happy existing. HAVE FUN. People are attracted to joy. They're attracted to people who are focused on the now, who are focused on simply getting to know them without a specific goal. Every single relationship is different. Give what you get, and enjoy the process. 

And most of all laugh. Laugh at stupid stuff. Find humour in the ridiculousness of life and the freaking awesome joy of simple things. I promise you so much of life and attraction is mindset and understanding the goals that might be directing your emotions and actions. If you've found yourself obsessing over the idea of a relationship, sit down and ask yourself deeply why.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/my0pac/enjoy_getting_to_know_people_have_fun_and_get_out/

78,my16ge,1619326472,"I'm getting bitter, please tell me I'm wrong.","Here I am, ghosted and alone. No more matches and the last few women I've knew in person tell me I'm not their type or just don't care.

I got out of a relationship at the tail end of 2019. It was toxic and I was in a bad place. I worked on myself. I got into a job that's turning into a career, I lost a ton of weight. I worked on my negative emotions, got a new wardrobe to try to spruce myself up. Worked on my self esteem and was more confident. 

I'm educated and have an interesting and fun hobby. I like to travel and experience new and fun things. 

I entertain as a hobby. I can make anyone laugh and I can show them impossible things (magician/mentalist) and I play music for fun. I like to go out and party on some weekends and do dumb goofy stuff for fun. I like to go out and experience life and see what's out there. 

But since I've been back in dating I've gone no where. 

The few women I've met or talk to never care to learn about me. Never care to put in any effort. Which I guess makes sense when you're spoiled with  bombardment of a ton of dudes you get the luxury to not give a fuck. It's just a picture on a screen, no one's behind it right?

When you pick people out of a human catalogue and you don't have to give anything for it, you take what you get for granted like the millionth shirt in their  closet or the dime they drop. 

And when you make a wrong comment or say the wrong thing or you're not constantly entertaining them they'll drop you for someone who will. 

It's like you don't matter, you as a person aren't good enough and if you are for now, they'll drop you when you aren't later. 

I can't take the idea of feeling like I'm a commodity for someone. It's not about me, it's only about what I can give, what I can offer you all the time. When I want something in return, an acknowledgment, an interest, a single bit of care. Ghosted. 

I don't do porn or nudes, I don't want to jump into bed. I don't want to hurt anyone, I'd like to be a positive influence in someone's life. But I want someone to care about what's going on in my world. Reciprocate some general care. I mean, sure we just started talking, but aren't you doing that with the intent on maybe starting a relationship (I don't usually go for those who say ""looking for just friends"") wouldn't you care to get to know me at all? Seeing how I react to day to day tells you so much about me as a person, wouldn't you want to inquire? 

I'm sorry I wasn't born pretty, I'm sorry I do have bad days, I'm sorry things aren't perfect in my world. I'm sorry I do have some issues, but I worked on them and  I work carefully to make sure it doesn't spew into other people's lives. I'm sorry I'm not always confident. I'm sorry things get me down at times. I'm sorry I have thoughts and feelings. I'm sorry I'm not just some cardboard cutout coddling your every word with no regard for myself. 

Why is it so hard to find someone to give a shit? Even on just a platonic or basic human level?

What's wrong with me? 

Am I entitled for thinking if you talk to me you should want to know me as much as I want to know you? I don't think anyone owes me sex or love or anything but if you're going to talk to me with the supposed intent of dating shouldn't you at least care to know about me first?

An hour goes by, and she messages me saying how she isn’t trying to be flaky at all and really wants to hang with me. I told her that it sucks to play a scenario out in your head and it gets crushed.

I’m (F19) yet to have my first time, but I’ve realized I might have a problem regarding my standards and who I want to have sex with overall. 

I have a really strong sex drive, but whenever there is a guy that could be a possible sex partner, I feel like I start only noticing his flaws and the perfect sexual partner only exists in the movies. It’s easy for me to say “I’d sleep with him” about hot guys, but whenever a quite hot guy approaches me, I have an anxious attachment and only notice his flaws.

I seem to reject the guys around me for these reasons but I’ve started to think that **will any guy EVER even match my standards?** I’m afraid I’m overthinking the perfect sexual partner in fears of a bad sex and not knowing how I react to it. 

How do I “humble” myself and take into account guys with flaws? **Cause after all, I have flaws too and we are all human, but my subconscious doesn’t seem to understand that**.

I don’t know, never found a deep connection since my Ex, and have kinda stopped looking for something especially since Covid hit. Most girls on dating apps seem to shallow, or not very deep on like a spiritual level. I find it attractive when a girl respects herself, is heathy, and doesn’t throw herself around aimlessly and has character. Anyways decided to go out dancing tonight, like Latin dancing. Haven’t done that in a while. But I am somewhat experienced dancer from my younger years. It’s interesting to dance because you can really feel the girls energy and connect with the girl. I have danced with many ladies in the past and once in a while you find someone where sparks fly. Like tonight, as soon as I stepped into her aura and touched her hands I was transported. Like could really feel her energy and was almost dejavú like. Where it seemed like I had encountered her in another realm or something. And looking into her eyes I was lost they were so bright. For like 15 seconds I couldn’t concentrate and my body was flush and heart started racing. It was like instant chemical reaction. I’ve only felt that a couple times in my 34 year life. Anyways, I got used to her energy and had a great time. She gave me her number and plans to meet up later... I don’t know, sounds pretty cheesy but anyone else experience connections like this, with lots of chemistry. It leaves you feeling really nice and happy :)",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/my26jl/you_ever_feel_instant_sparks_with_someone/

93,my343n,1619335089,"It's been over two years now, and I think i did pretty okay with myself! Now what?","About two years ago, sometime in March, I made the decision to just quit dating. All through college I dated around quite a bit. At peak, about 2-3 dates per week, some even in the same day. About 30% would be second dates, and 5-10% would be third+ dates. After a long period it just got boring. I wasn't sleeping around or anything, just casual dates in the daylight. Met lots of people and just came to the conclusion that I wasn't really enjoying the time I spent with... any of them actually. College finished, and a couple years went by where I continued to date in my new area where I worked. Eventually, about two years ago, I finally came to the conclusion that there were other things I'd rather do with my time. I had started to view dating as a hobby, and like any other hobby, I decided to move on and try some new things.  
  
So I did. I got into game development and team leadership, for a few months I leaned hardcore into getting good at my favorite video game, I stopped everything at one point to read a couple of books (Knocking on Heaven's Door and Warped Passages, fantastic books on particle physics and the Higgs-Boson experiments, and history of the Large Hadron Collider). Developed my career and went through two promotions in under 3 years, built a diversified portfolio of investments and savings, and even set up some passive income sources so my job has now become a ""hobby"" as well, to the point where I don't actually need it financially. In my free time I keep up with my game development and am working towards a few certifications in my field and a masters degree that I'm super excited about! Needless to say, lots of stuff going on and I think I've done pretty okay!  
  
Now, I'm starting to wonder if post-Covid it would be fun to date again. I get my second shot in a week, which means within a month I should be set! I'm a bit concerned that I'm ""out of touch"" or that maybe what worked before won't work now. Last time I was on the scene, OLD still worked pretty well and it wasn't quite so badly infested with bots, and there were more convos to be had. It may still be a while before I can casually walk into a cafe and sit for hours talking to other customers and just chilling. Was wondering if anyone had some advice on what a good plan of attack would be? The last time I was able to just waltz into a casual cafe with a book, or maybe my old gameboy color or my laptop to do some CAD or programming and that would be plenty to spark some conversation. That was almost 3 years ago now though. Lots has changed. So what's up now? :D",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/my343n/its_been_over_two_years_now_and_i_think_i_did/
94,my38nu,1619335731,It's the finding someone that I have the problem with...,"I (M,22) have had little luck with dating both in my adolescence and as an adult. I'm rather shy and introverted, but most usually I can get along with anyone if I have to. While I don't really have friends or a social circle anymore on the account that I moved a few states away into a city during the worst time to be around people in modern history. So, because of that I've been shut in and a homebody this whole time. I've enjoyed it since I don't need to be around people. Although, I've wanted to try dating again.

The glaring problem is I can't meet anyone... I'm no bar crawler or go getter, so I usually keep to myself when out and about. Besides, I'd rather leave everyone else alone and they leave me alone whenever I'm in public.

I just can't see any places conducive to meeting the type of person I'm hoping to meet. I've tried guessing where that type of person would be, but at best I could say they'd be at home...

So, I'm lost as to where to meet someone. I've tired apps, but ugly bearded men with long braided hair don't seem to fair too well from my experience.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/my38nu/its_the_finding_someone_that_i_have_the_problem/
95,my3h3g,1619336886,Is it safe to assume my ex-boyfriend (35M) isn't interested in me (26F) anymore. Advice?,"I’ve been dating this guy for about 8/9 months. We’re 9 years apart and I don’t notice the age difference. 34m, 25f. We get along like a house on fire, always laughing together. He tells me regularly ‘I laugh so much with you’, I know his friends, his family know about me but we haven’t been able to meet due to Covid. He used to call his parents every Sunday but since we’ve been dating, it’s become less and less. We normally see each other a few times a week, sometimes less or more depending on our schedule. He invites me to all the 'big' things in his life, for example, we were going to go to his medical ball together (he would've been seen with me in front of other girls if there is anything nefarious). When we drive or hangout in different areas together, he likes to look up the prices of houses. He's also said in front of me how cute kids are and that he can't wait to do that one day. Signs to me he's testing my reaction and seeing if I want that as well.

A few months into dating, he asked to make sure that we’re not seeing other people. He isn’t into casual sex and I think exclusivity is important to him. A few months ago I was anxious about what we were - he hadn’t asked me to be his girlfriend and I thought this is something that he would’ve wanted to do. He’s traditional, wanting something serious such as marriage/family. We had a few talks about the direction of our relationship, he said there were a few things he was a bit concerned about, a few things we maybe didn’t have in common (he’s very risk-averse and overthinks everything).

He’s studying so after that conversation he said he would decide at the end of his exams, his exams have finished now. He went away recently with some of his University friends, he was unsure of whether to go (seemed like he wanted to be with me, haha) and wanted to see me before he left. I’ve felt good about everything between us post-exams as I had a feeling he was going to slowly contact me less and less and try and see me less - due to his uncertainty.

One night on the phone, I told him that I wasn’t quite sure whether continuing to have sex with him was a wise idea as we aren’t boyfriend/girlfriend. He was confused that I said it was casual. I said ‘well, we aren’t in a relationship’ and he said ‘you are my girlfriend’ I’m certain he went onto say ’I thought we’ve known this since we started dating’ so I then asked him ‘well if I was to meet a new friend of yours that I haven’t met, would you introduce me as your girlfriend? And he said yes. Unfortunately, he has to repeat his exams so I may not be able to see him for a while, I do need to clarify that he actually meant this.I just wonder why he had this hesitancy a few times when we had the discussion a few months back though? There was even a point where I suggested we should end things because he wasn't so sure and he agreed. Maybe this is natural though and a reflection of his risk-averse attitude about things. There were just some uncertainties on his part. He said he could've been overthinking it. As a result, it sort of made me more anxious and I suggested we should end it.

He said it’ll be good to have a proper chat about things as we’ve both been putting things off, as so he said.

I got to his house, he said yes I have been his girlfriend all along and he doesn't know why I would think otherwise. He said that he feels it’s not going to work because of our age gap and he claims we're very different people. I personally do not see this as I feel like we share the same values, we're compatible in a lot of areas etc. He told me that he finds me beautiful, loves my sense of humour and that we get along and have fun together. I did mention that we handle conflict differently but our only arguments have been over text/call and since that's such a poor form of communication - it's hard to tell.

He started to cry (this is the most emotion I've seen from him), saying he won't be able to cook me any more dinners and our memories shared together. He then went back and forth and said he doesn't know if he's making the right decision, that he will never find someone like me, I am out of his league etc. He said maybe he's just one big idiot after all and he's made a stupid decision. I was calm in my response and he said ""why don't you get angry? this is making it more difficult"" in a somewhat cute way. He just kept saying that lately everything has been solidified in his brain that it's probably the most responsible decision. He asked me if I thought he was being unreasonable.

Now I feel like since we've been arguing quite a bit the past few weeks and he's been stressed, possibly his decision is skewed. I hadn't seen him in 2 or 3 weeks due to exams and I asked whether maybe we just got cold feet because of us not seeing each other. I remember months ago he said he sometimes questions us in absence.

We spent over 4 hours talking and it was like he didn't want me to leave nor did I. He then asked if we should go to dinner together. He finally walked me to my car and he couldn't stop crying.

Something in me decided to message him the other morning after I left:Me - Morning 📷 I don’t know if messaging you is the best idea, but I hope you haven’t woken up too sad. If you ever want to catch up on neutral grounds, a coffee or lunch, don’t hesitate - I still consider you a friend. Even under these circumstances, it was nice to see you last night and I am saddened I won’t be able to have more of them with you. That’s all 📷Him - Morning! I was in two minds as to whether to message you with the same sentiment 📷 I feel very much the same. Like you say it’s always nice seeing you, and it’s hard for me to think we won’t be sharing more moments together. I really hope you’re feeling ok today 📷 Enjoy the rest of your weekend 📷Me - Aw, well if you’re keen to catch up in a week to come or a few months, let me know. I’m trying to not make this any harder for us but it is difficult. I didn’t react with anger because that’s genuinely not how I feel about us. I miss you, enjoy your morning eggs 📷Him - Will do 📷 miss you too, at least you can have your eggs with olive oil today 📷Me - These thoughts are best discussed in person but I’m not sure if that can happen and they’re weighing heavy on me. I do think we could work through the issues as I feel there are more positives than negatives. I am aware that the past few weeks have been pretty nasty for the both of us but I’ve been particularly harsh on you. If I don’t hear back from you, I will, of course, assume you do not feel the same way and will accept your decision.Him - I thought I did explain that although the last month or so has been really difficult, it hasn’t been the main reason why I reached the decision I did. Of course I’m always really happy to talk to you about anything though, so if you still want to talk things through naturally I’m happy to do that 📷He went onto say that he hates that he's upset me and that it's all really difficult for him but he **thinks** it's all for the best.

We caught up and went to the beach together. We had a good time, he just feels at the moment he thinks it’s the best decision, although he isn’t fully confident he’s doing the right thing. He said maybe in a year it’ll make more sense and we realise we’re fit for each other. He said that he told his mother we broke up and she got really angry. Something was quite odd, he told me his friend (who I know) broke up with his girlfriend but they’re back together. We then went back to his for a cup of tea and we talked a bit more. He admitted that he does get in his head a lot and could be overthinking things. Said again that he's scared he's going to lose someone amazing but feels it's the right decision **right now**. Again, I feel because I've been arguing with him over text lately and he feels overwhelmed. When I left, he said he wants to see me again in a week or 2.

We spoke on the phone and I told him it’s really painful catching up with him and I don’t want to feel like an option to him or being left on the back burner, he said that wasn’t his intention and he would never do that as he has too much respect for me. He said it was hard catching up with me recently as well. He said he agreed to catching up because he felt like it was something I wanted. We spoke a bit more and he said that if he has a change of heart in the future, he won’t just sit on it. He’ll tell me. He told me he hopes I know how beautiful I actually am.

He ended up calling/messaging me over Christmas and NYE. I do feel like I am the one who predominately initiates contact with him first, I’ve been sending him sort of lengthy messages and he claims he’s overwhelmed by it. Recently we’ve been having an hour or so conversations when we usually would never have that as he was never one to speak on the phone. He expressed doubts about our break up as per usual and said he’s probably one big idiot after all. He told me he’s been on 2 dates with 2 girls as I asked, said he’s sort of interested but it hasn’t gone anywhere. I was quite upset and he assured me he wants to stay single for a while, he also said it’s not like he even wants a relationship with them. He said to give me some context that there were girls before we met that he was interested but it didn’t go anywhere. I was quite offended because he went on dates with girls that he basically broke up with me for. He broke up with me over an age gap but then went on dates with girls my age? Makes no sense. He said it’s all really regrettable and then told me that it's not that he wants a relationship with these people and said they’re just friends he wanted to get to know better. He said he wishes I could see his phone. Near the end of the phone call, he got teary about the fact he thinks I'm so sweet and don't deserve this.

He said over a month ago that a catch up would be good to clear the air. He also wouldn’t directly answer the question when I asked if he just sees me as a friend. I’ve decided to pull back, but it seems like he wants to catch up. At the start of this month, he offered to call about something, I think he was sort of surprised by that as I usually am jumping at any chance for us to speak on the phone. He sent me a message about the date/time tba (which I didn't respond to) and then he sent me a follow up message about a week later saying “Morning, when works this week for you?” with a smiley face. He then said whenever is fine, to choose a day/evening and let him know. He then said he hopes my mother is doing okay. This was 2 weeks ago and I didn't responded. He sent me another message 2 weeks later saying he hadn’t heard from me in a while, was wondering how I am and asked if my mother is okay. I replied and I was friendly, but brief. He replied and said a few things and then said ‘we never caught up in the end, let me know if you would still like to’ we talked a bit more and then I told him that I feel he just wants to catch up to free himself from guilt and that we can only catch up if we both feel it’s best for us to be together. He responded with saying that he understands and he didn’t think it would still be really difficult but he understands and there is a bit of truth in wanting to free himself but he thought it would be healthy in general. Apologised for the pain he’s caused me and wished me all the best. I told him that I just felt him talking about clearing the air was ominous and I just wanted to have dinner with him and not talk about us. He said that he understands how that could have caused it and apologies and said it’s the furthest from how he wanted to make me feel. I didn't respond and that was 3 weeks ago now. For my birthday, I never received a text from him and I didn’t receive anything over easter either. I haven’t heard from him since and in 2 weeks, that would be 3 months that have gone by.

\*\*TL;DR\*\* ex-boyfriend broke up with me in November 2020. He cried a lot that day. He's expressed doubt and says he's probably one big idiot regarding his decision. We caught up a week after we broke up but I've decided to not see him for my own reasons. Lately he's been initiating more contact and has been quite persistent in catching up with me but conditions the catch up as 'clearing the air'.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/my3h3g/is_it_safe_to_assume_my_exboyfriend_35m_isnt/
96,my3que,1619338114,I (18F) am no longer excited to receive his (23M) calls... or spend time together.... feels like a chore.,"He is the sweetest thing sometimes, we have our differences. As all couples do but I do love him, what type of love? I'm not sure.

He really has helped with many many things and I am so grateful for him coming onto my life.

The issue is lately... I find him very annoying. Please please guys dont hate on me. I'm just saying my feelings.

I think it got to that point because of many frustrations that built up.

I do not look forward to our moments spent together  anymore (in an LDR so, calls and texts.) When I try to be positive, he by default is negative.

When something doesnt go our way in a surprise he makes for me. He gets mad and when I say it is okay! He says, ""No baby. It is not."" Even when I dont even mind. Be mind so much that it seems like I'd have to mind.

He doesnt mean to be toxic, I'm sure. He means well, but, it always seems to make things worst the way he takes things. He has been through a lot and he treasures me a ton.

Today was our date night and we played a video game. He has NO CLUE how to play it and I try to teach him but he just doesn't get it. I understand to an extent.... their is a barrier between us by how he dowsnt know English as his first language. 

I tell him over and over. He takes long to get it or does not get it at all. Then despite my battle plans, he bolts out and fights randomly. He is not even that good at fighting yet. I'm trying to tech him but... he isnt open to learning it seems.


I try to kept happy and everything for him and me. Bit, we both are having a hard time in life and that is what makes it worst. Maybe I grew some resentment. . 

Then if I take beyond 10 minutes to text him back he gets horribly worried. Thinking I'm hurt or upset at him.


He beats himself up so much and I cannot help him, he doesnt listen to me when he thinks he 'disappointed' me when let's say for example, internet but off so no movie night. He would say like it's his fault and so forth.

I am young, I'm supposed to be free and happy and though I like, want out instill adore him but something is just not right... he wants to better himself only for me but he should do it for himself.... relationships shouldn't work like that.

I also feel kinda trapped like, I would break him if I left. He is so attached to me...

My life is just beginning to get up, I am gaining friends I adore, getting to be more independent and move for school which I dreamed for years. Then having free time... I wont have any free time cause that is his time. And his time with me is no longer fun.

I dreamed to be a streamer... but no. Can't really with him needing my attention. I wanted to live life to the fullest (life for me, not pulling any other guys into it)

But yes, I'm at this point where I love him and know he is sweet but he irritates me. Everything I found cute and romantic from him upsets me.

Life is looking up in so many ways.... is he bringing me down? That's not the main question of this post. I just want view and opinions on this matter.

And maybe ways to restore the relationship? Not sure.

Thank you for reading, this was not meant to be rude but kinda venting. Have a great night or day!

Tl;dr Boyfriend is beginning to get on my nerves all the time, may have been resentment built up. He beats himself up for things he doesnt have power over and mostly doesnt accept positivity.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/my3que/i_18f_am_no_longer_excited_to_receive_his_23m/
97,my3rha,1619338197,Is he unlucky or playing games?,"I (27F) met a guy (31M) on a dating app around 5 weeks ago. 

DATE 1 - We went for a walk and hit it off immediately. He asked for a second date before the first date even ended.

DATE 2 - Great second dinner date at his place.

CANCELLATION - We’d arranged a third date but when it came around it cancelled in the morning and said that he was sick. 

DATE 3 - Rescheduled when he was better. Another great date, again, arranging another one before the date even ended. 

DATE 4 - Another good date. 

CANCELLATION - On our next date he cancelled the morning of, because he had an eye infection. I asked him to send me a picture of it (he knows I love gore) and he did immediately. 

DATE 5 -  We ended up sleeping together after dinner and made to decision to only see each other. 

DATE 6 - Last night we went went for drinks at a local bar. He asked me to watch his phone whilst he went to the bathroom but said ‘actually watch it’, which I thought was strange. I just assumed that he was joking. Shortly after, his brother texts him and says that there is a family emergency. We drive back to his place and he calls his brother, who tells him that his father has had a heart attack. His family live 3+ hours away so he immediately begins to pack a bag. He drops me home and drives off to be with his family.

Prior to this message the date was going really well and we’d been almost falling out of our chairs laughing at each others stories

My question is, is it just pure bad luck that these things have cropped up when we had plans or is there more to this and if there is more to it, what could his agenda possibly be?


I have to mention that he tells me all the time how much he likes me, talks about future/dates plans, meeting his family if things go well etc.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/my3rha/is_he_unlucky_or_playing_games/
