She is married I think, or has a bf or something but he is hardly ever home and I've passed the guy in the parking lot and he comes across as a real tool.  

She only has my number because our parking lot is small so sometimes we have to block each other so we exchanged numbers one time and then recently she sent me a couple selfies.  The first one I ignored but the second one I sent a smiley face emoji with the heart eyes, now she is blowing my phone up with them.

I mean I know what's up, I'm just debating if I should go over there and give it to her, or just leave it be.

7,qg783y,1635257350,Do you guys also self-sabotage?,"I'll give u my backstory.
I'm that type of person who when is interested in someone I just make myself do things for them, and a lot of things that I don't identify myself with but I just do to get to know them better and try to build a relationship with. The sad part that makes me furious about myself, is that in the end I'm the clown who is always chasing but doesn't get anything in return from the other person. The other person doesn't even do the bare minimum for me, and somehow I just accept, only because they say they like me back (but actually don't show it properly).
So I am tired of that crap I always do and now I just want someone to chase me. At the moment I don't like anyone, because I just can't see someone with potencial to build something purposeful and meaningful, so I'm waiting and also observing my surroundings.
Last night I saw a friend's story and there was one guy who was really, but really cute, and he had something about our interests in common. I just went to his insta and started following him right away. I caught myself so excited to find someone with the same interests as me and also cute looking, I was just so happy. But since I'm an overthinker, I started to cry and realized I was about to start something again and probably get hurt because I would end up coming my way to make something.
I thought maybe I should see if he follows back within 24 hours and see if he would say something. I woke up today already making my mind to unfollow and forget about him because I would probably play a Clown again. He didn't follow me back (it was morning, so I don't even know if he saw the request), so I decided to unfollow and force myself to stop thinking about it.
So basically now I can't stop thinking about this situation and how I am a crappy person because I just can't be pursued because I am always the first to caught someone cute before they even know I exist or if I ever have value to them...

Sorry for the long text, I just need to understand if my self sabotage is healthy, because in the end, if it's meant to be with somebody, we will get back together somehow. And please, I'm not saying I won't work things for a relationship, I think it's the effort of both parties that make a difference, I am just tired of being the one to take a step and pursue guys without being pursued back.

8,qg78ln,1635257394,Why does it seem like to get the girl you want you have to ignore her,"There was this girl I liked a lot like easily the biggest crush I’ve ever had on a girl. And I always knew from the very beginning just from observing her that she always chased/ seemed more interested in guys who ignore her or don’t give her much attention. She always rings guys phone who ignores her and begs for their attention like she will say stuff like why  don’t you ever contact me first etc you don’t care about me etc. Or in the Library there’s this one guy who never talks to her and she always chases him and she’s always the one talks first to him. 


I was thinking about pulling and pushing with her but she opened up to me about her depression and suicidal thoughts so I decided to leave it plus I don’t want to be someone I’m not and play  these childish games etc. 
Anyway we did end up doing a lot of activities together and she would even say romantic stuff to me but she just ended up leading me on due to all her insecurities and choose another guy over me.  This guy just ignores her and he even told her in public when they are in a group not to speak to him  because he don’t want people to think they are dating.  Despite all that she’s still all over him and always chase him and even wants to switch her degree to his degree which is crazy considering this is is last year 


And all the girls that have wanted  to date me have always been girls which I put the least effort in and ignore for girls that I’m interested in. I can never ever get the girl I want.

- One rainy night, the guy invited the girl to stay at his place. They get frisky but no sex
- He calls her next day to say he felt bad and they won’t do it again.
- Another situation arises where she stays over due to circumstance, frisky again
- During one night when she’s over, she tells him to “stick the tip in”(he does not)
- Time goes by, and he starts to have her stay over more so they can see each other and to avoid spending money
- One night, after promising a night over and fun date, he calls to tell her to leave by 8 and that she won’t be over again
 - They bicker, break up, get back together
- They plan a long road trip to the beach, she was going to stay over.
- She cancels and says she’s not staying over, but he presses her to stay.
- She stays over, but nothing crazy happens

Other notes:
- When she came over, he initiated most of the frisky stuff.
- He would put her on an air mattress, but grab her during night and put her on the bed
- He criticized her for not speaking up when he was telling her to stay over and when he was getting tempted, questioning if she really wanted to wait for sex
- She didn’t wait in the previous relationship

I've sought out advice, I've tried to start relationships with women, and it just doesn't work for me at all. I've always been told that dating starts with being friends, and yet I become friends with a woman and she ends up dating someone else. I confess to a woman, and she says no because she never feels the same way. I'm told I should be happy by myself before I can be happy in a relationship and yet I'm not and there's such a thing as learning to love myself with the help of someone else. I'm told that I'm desperate because I'm actively seeking a gf, so I'm just supposed to want a gf without actually wanting a gf? Meanwhile, I'm getting older and older and I still have the dating and sexual experience of a 16 year old, so I have that to stress out about. I spent all my time in school constantly getting rejected and never being able to learn anything from it because they were all super flakey about it. Never wanted to say why, never wanted to deal with it, just wanted to run away and never deal with it. These days I can't help but feel that all the good women (""good"" meaning someone I'd find mentally and physically attractive, who is actually emotionally capable of having a healthy, loving relationship) around my age already met someone. Of course, all this would be easier if a woman saw me as worthy of being pursued, but that's never once happened. If it did, it's because they insisted on solely relying on hints and vague signs and then wondering why I didn't ask her out. Lately though, I have actually been focusing on just making friends with dating as a secondary focus. I've met some very kind women over the last year, but every. Single. One of them. Had a bf. I didn't come right out and ask, it just casually came up. 

Before y'all say that I'm only worried because I'm a virgin, that's only a small part of it. I want to love and be loved. I want someone to share my life with, my hobbies, my thoughts, my feelings, and my experiences with, and I want them to share the same with me. I want a wife, not just a warm body in my bed.

Also before y'all start dismissing me as an angry, misogynistic inc3l or whatever, yeah I'm frustrated, who wouldn't be after failing at 1 thing for so long? And no, I'm not a misogynist.

Blame women.

Blame men.

Blame dating apps.

It might make you feel better to blame these things.

Well, it does actually. I've been in that position myself. Sometimes you need a little external validation from others to know that you are not the only weirdo on this planet who can't seem to land a solid relationship or even a date. 

But it will never be a progressive mindset for the long term. If anything, a defeatest mindset is nothing but a gangrene. The more you stand, the more you will grow roots in that place and find it harder and harder to move from and those vines tighten around your ankles. Eventually you'll have to try and catch up with the ceaseless ticking of time and accept that even though it's going to hurt to try again, at least you won't die with the regret of never knowing what COULD have happened in life if you had just made a little more effort. 

I'd rather suffer for trying my best to succeed, instead of feeling comfortable and justified in my own  misery. 

Take it from someone who knows what it feels like to be cast out of the only community you've ever known (i was raised in a religious sect that I later rejected) as well as someone who had to go through some of the worst growing pains and somewhat embarrassing unlearning processes. The loneliness was crippling, it felt like a disease sometimes because the emotional weakness would translate into physical pains. Its a hard job to look at yourself and say ""I am responsible for me, I could be better, I could be wrong, I could be looking for the wrong things in people, I could be failing at this because I'm repeating the same behaviours, I could be wasting my own time"". There is nothing easy about this process, even if it looks that way for others. 

We can sit and offset our blame, even if its justified. Sure. There are jerks in the world, there are selfish people who just want your status or money or success and there are people who will take advantage of you. They might succeed now and again, but why would you allow them to condemn you to a life of misery? Do you think they pause and wonder how you are doing? or regret their actions? Likely not. So why die on that hill?

If you want to sit still, then sit. It's ok for a moment, or a day, or a week. But you'll have to catch up eventually, or simply accept that you are fine if life goes on without you.

Life carries on anyways, no matter how unfair it feels. As unforgiving as that might be, and as bleak as you might feel, I doubt you truly want to throw in the towel completely.

28,qg9e2i,1635263453,Guys that are bad at sex,"So I have two issues with dating involving sex. For one, I find that a lot of men I’ve gone on dates with try to have sex with me right away which is a red flag if I have said I want to take things slow and I’m looking for a relationship. I know some people have different opinions on this, but I am looking for a guy who isn’t into casual hook ups and this is just how I weed those guys out. I believe that having sex too soon can ruin things for people too, and allows them to focus on sex instead of whether or not the two people are a good match. There are people who will let sex cloud their judgement about a person, and it just muddies things up for some people. 

However, waiting too long to have sex can present another issue. What if I wait awhile to get to know the guy, I’m satisfied that he’s not just after sex, and then I hate having sex with him.  I feel that around 90 percent of men I’ve had sex with I did not enjoy having sex with them. I talk to other women, and they often have the same experiences. Some women aren’t that sexual and could care less about how big a guys penis is or how long he lasts in bed, but for women who do care I hear it’s a problem. For me the problem is that I find that most guys I have had sex with last under 5 minutes in bed. Sometimes it’s been up to ten minutes but never more than that except for 2 men out of all the the guys I’ve been with. It’s disappointing because then after I have to say well, I guess it’s on to the next one. 

From doing some reading I read stats that say for most women it takes 20 minutes for them to have an orgasm while it takes men anywhere from 2-10 minutes. I usually give guys a few chances like up to 6 chances probably before I decide that they are just not going to last very long in bed ever . I feel bad talking to them about it because I don’t want to make them feel horrible if it’s out of their control. But I also feel bad ghosting a guy after sex. When in the past I talked to a couple guys about it and asked if they could read about fixing it like whether it be jerking off more, etc. nothing worked. Usually the men I’ve slept with who don’t last very long sometimes also have issues with maintaining an erection. I read that the two can go hand in hand and that this is becoming a big issue with men. Health issues like stress, being over weight, and blood pressure issues can contribute to this so it can be a very common problem. To make matters worse lots of men don’t even see a problem in these issues and don’t even try to satisfy women in bed. 

I have talked to other women to find out how I can vet men for these issues before I sleep with them and the consensus has been that I can’t . I thought maybe giving a handjob first could work, but then I realized that a handjob is very different than sex and from talking to guys men can last a lot longer from them. And talking about it first doesn’t help either because lots of men will just lie about their Dick size and bedroom skills. So I guess I just have to have sex with them to find out. I guess if women want guys that don’t have small penises and also have stamina, we should be dating black guys. Which also hasn’t worked out great for me. So even a thing like my sexual preferences, which are only a small part compared to other things I value in a man, makes me feel like I will never meet a man who matches my standards. If I can’t even meet a man who can sexually satisfy me, other parts of having a relationship are less appealing. I can take care of myself, I have a vibrator, I have friends to keep me entertained….so why should I want to date? This is something I ask myself whenever I try dating. I guess I am just venting about it but if anyone has any advice on how to deal with these issues let me know.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qg9e2i/guys_that_are_bad_at_sex/

So I gave him my snap, he added me aaaaand nothing. No snaps, no messages, nada. (Mind you it’s only been a few hours since I added him.)

32,qg9xmp,1635264965,I fucked up epically,"It's been 2 weeks and I'm still a mess. 

I 27F was dating this guy 24M for 3 weeks. We had 3 dates with a group of mutual friends and 1 with just the two of us. At first I was sceptical because he's younger and parties hard all the time (raves, drugs, alcohol). I also like to party, that's how we met but I have a stable job and healthier surroundings. Although I was sceptical, I decided to give him a chance because we clicked and the chemistry was great.

Anyway, we agreed on a date on a Sunday 2 weeks ago but I was at a party on Friday and met a guy. I was really, really drunk (I am still mortified) and went to his place and hooked up with him. I  don't usually do that. Well, later it turned out that him and the guy I was dating were friends. I'm still shocked by this coincidence, we both weren't aware of this connection.

The guy I was dating didn't reach out on Sunday so I knew he found out about everything. But 2 days later he sent me a pasive aggresive message to let me know he knows. I apologised and told him I fucked up and am terribly sorry it happened. He said that everything is fine and that he doesn't resent me anything. He also said it's a funny story but I believe he was just acting like he doesn't care. He also told me I fucked up but that that's okay because we weren't planning on having anything serious anyway. I didn't reply after that. 

It's been 2 weeks of NC but I can't stop thinking about him and what I've done. We weren't exclusive or anything but I'm so sad that it happened. I don't usually have drama like this.

We have some mutual friends so there's a possibility we will meet somewhere by accident. Should I approach him then or just let everything go?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qg9xmp/i_fucked_up_epically/

He was pursuing me heavily, but lately I feel like I’ve been doing more of the initiating. Last week I spent a few days at his place. Since I left he hasn’t reached out and neither have I. It’s been 6 days which is the longest we haven’t been in contact. I know I can text him, but I want to see if he'll reach out and make more of an effort. He has a demanding sales job that I know has been stressing him out, but at the same time it doesn't take long to send a text. I’ve been keeping busy by focusing on myself, work, and fitness. Is this playing games?

I was reading the book Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus by John Gray and it mentioned that men need space after getting close to rebuild testosterone before they start missing you and come back. I would really like to talk, but I don't know if I should keep giving him space until he reaches out on his own or just message him.

So I ignored that request and asked him questions to get to know him better. He answered very brief like as if almost annoyed and didn't ask me anything in return and then asked again if I wanted to meet. 
I told him I believe that if we can't find anything in common over the text, the date might not turn out to be fun. 
To which he responds saying he thinks he's better in person and doesn't want to ""waste his time"" texting because he's very busy. 
So I told him, it would make sense to spend a few minutes to get to know the person a little over text so you're not wasting 3-4 hours of your weekend time (he has nothing of value on his profile to understand his personality, it's all about how he responds to texts in mins and likes to sleep when he finds time). 

To that huge text of mine he responds with ""so, do you want to meet up?"" 

So I tell him, it seems like he hasn't even read my huge text and I, unfortunately, don't think it's going to work out. 
(My logic was that if he can't listen to my needs this is going to be nothing but waste of time) 
To which he responds saying, ""how can a person with my looks have such foul attitude"" ""it could fly with a hot girl but definitely not you"" "" I thought you would be glad that someone atleast asked you out"". And then unmatched me 

His first message to me was ""you look beautiful in your pics"" 

No one has ever been in this mean to me. Like ever. And if anyone was I'd brush it off. But what hit a nerve was the fact that ever since I turned 30 and started dating, my matches have significantly reduced. And he's right, I really don't have anyone asking me out. Also, there is no one I want to go out with. 
And thats why I was even talking to him even though my status quo would be to ummatch as soon as someone showed as little interest as him. 

I need to understand what is this behavior. I'm starting to think maybe he was right. It is my looks? Not to give a jerk more power over me, but can't help but think that.

The next day we chatted again for a while and he asked for my number and IG. We kept talking sporadically but he never asked to hang out or texted me first.

Fast forward two weeks later to today when he unfollowed me :( It stings so much because I know that is the ultimate sign of disinterest meanwhile I’ve been crushing so hard on him. What I want to know is does this mean he finds me unattractive, and that is he no longer dtf? I consider myself hot and I do have other guys interested in me, but I def don’t post thirst traps or anything sexy IMO. Would it be outlandishly stupid and show a lack of self-respect if I still reached out to see if he was dtf? At this point I know I wouldn’t want to date someone as elusive and unreliable as him, but I can’t help that he’s so attractive to me and I’ve had my sights set on him.

I am not sure how this is supposed to work.  I asked if she would come visit me when I get settled.  She said no.  That wasn’t the answer I was expecting, but she explained how it was important for her to get married and have children.  If she continued to see me it would make that goal more difficult for her.  I told her that made sense.  

I just don’t know where things stand.  I dislike the suggestion that I am wasting her time.  She gives me mixed signals by saying how much she misses me when we are apart.  But when you are together she tells me how she knows I am moving away.  It doesn’t make a lot of sense.  

I wanted her to come visit because it would be fun for both of us.  It would be something exciting that we could both look forward to.  I understand how that doesn’t fit her needs.  I am unsure why she hasn’t broken things off entirely if the relationship isn’t working for her.

50,qgbsre,1635270131,My (24/M) solution to paying on first dates,"The problem

On first dates, when it comes to settling the bill, a certain proportion of women expect me to cover it, and will be put off/annoyed if I don't. The rest will be fine with paying half. To make matters worse, a lot of the ones who want me to pay will offer to split as a 'polite gesture', making it hard to know what camp they fall into.

Personally, I resent having to pay on a first date. All the women I date are 22+ and have jobs the same as me, so splitting seems fair. I like treating someone I'm in a relationship with to things occasionally, but that's because I really like them and genuinely want to. If it's a first date, odds are we hardly know each other, and there's a good chance we wont see each other again if one of us isn't feeling it. 

So paying for everything, while I can afford it, seems like a waste of money (I live in London so cocktails can be as much as £13). But at the same time, I don't want to lose out on women who I might get on well with, but have been brainwashed with the ""men who don't pay on dates don't respect you/are cheap bla bla"" narrative.

Solution

1. I don't go to restaurants for a first date

I go to a bar instead. This avoids the awkward moment where they present the bill at the end. I also find restaurants quite formal for a first date, as I think most people my age do.

2. When I get into the bar, I say ""I'll get a round""

The wording is important here. I don't say ""I'll get this round"" because that puts pressure on her to reciprocate (and to get a second drink at all). Then I pay for the round then and there - no tabs with a massive awkward bill at the end.

3. That's it

I'm not a fan of drinking loads on dates, so I'm fine with just having one drink. I'd also be up for one more if she asks. And if she asks, that means she's the type that is fine with splitting.

How do you go from that point to experiencing success in dating? Nobody has ever given me that sort of advice.

Well, I in fact do all these things. I lost a ton of weight several years ago and I exercise just about every day.

We have many similarities and it seemed that she liked me enough to want to go on a second date. However, on our first outing the subject of past relationships came up in the realm of discussion.  Essentially, she stated she had gotten out of a long-term relationship which lasted about a year and a half and she's been back on the dating scene for a couple of months now.

And since young men are having even less sex than before i would assume that the number of men left out is bigger than before, but i still don't hear any women complain like men do.

Is it because women are not as vocal about the lack of relationship? Not as active on social media or internet forums where they vent their thoughts? Or do women, more so than men, feel they have a chance with dating so they are not as bitter as these men?

Cause everyone can figure out there got to be an equal amount of men and women being left out assuming everyone pairing is doing that for a long time.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qgcakc/why_are_there_less_women_compared_to_men/

58,qgclf9,1635272293,What do you guys/girls feel about seeking closure this way?," So a male friend of mine broke up with his now ex-girlfriend.

A couple of months after the break up the girl started seeing someone else, which of course didn't make him feel that great.

But he told me what he did after to find closure, and it made me wonder if what he did was smart.

This is what he did:

He saw her instagram bio stating that she loved someone else, It hurt him a little he said, but he shrugged it off and wanted to be open-minded about things and move on.

So he sent her an email that said he acknowledges that she's in a relationship and hope things will work out for them (the new couple), he also said in the email that he will block her so she shouldn't take it personally, and maybe one day they might end up as friends, and lastly he said goodbye.

She wrote back with another email saying that she indeed found someone else, and that she enjoyed the times she spent with her now-ex (my friend). or something like that...I kind of forgot.

He says he's over her now and doing whatever he finds fun in life.

What do you men/women think of this? Is this a healthy way of seeking closure?...how would you feel if you got this email from your ex if you were in a new relationship?

Write in your comment what gender you are, I'd like to know from both perspectives.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qgclf9/what_do_you_guysgirls_feel_about_seeking_closure/

English isn't my first language. 

I already posted 2 times about that issue.

I have a friend, 29F who is ugly and has a weird voice (a deaf voice). 

It is not a question of taste. She already posted pictures and tagged me and people would DM me to ask if she was a man with a wig or worse, tell me that she looks ugly AF. 

Her eyes are falling, she has huge eyebrows, he teeth are all upside down, her skin is subject to kyst so she has many scars, her face is very square with no round (no cheeks), a huge chin double length than a normal one. 

Her voice doesn't help. It's very masculine. 

She is my friend so IDGAF of her appearance. She's got 8373727272 qualities and any man would be lucky to have her. 

She is trying to date for like 2 years and uses dating apps. 

She has met MANY guys and it always ends up the same way. Strong feeling on the phone, they meet, the Guy ghost her or tell her he isn't interested.

Pictures she uses don't show her teeth and the voice of course can't be heard and the shape of her face isn't that obvious cause she choses her pose. 

Sometimes, she just want sex and even guys aren't open for that. 

Why am I writing today? 

Another guy send her a text message today after they met saying she had a great personality but he wasn't attracted. 

People told me here to never say anything about her even though things could be improved on her face. 

Why am I writing again today? 

The thing is, after receiving this message today she just told me she was like going into a deep depression because she didn't know what's was wrong with her and is hella scared to stay single forever. 

She is losing self esteem AF. 

I am supporting her 100% but should I tell her after when she'll get better? 

She says she knows she has huge eyebrows, her teeth... But she has no issue with that and doesn't connect with the fact it could be the issue.

The date went great, we had dinner and wine, and one of the best conversations I’ve had this year, I really felt a special connection.
Weeks went by and I tried to stay present by sending a message or two everyday, until I asked her out again.
She just told me how she doesn’t feel ready for a relationship and she’s only looking for a friendship, which I understood.
For the first time I decided to not take this as if I’m not good enough and I’m not feeling bad, I actually feel relieved and thankful both for the moment we had and her honesty.
It’s important to understand that even when things go great there will be times when the outcome won’t be what we expected and we just have to accept that just as in other aspects of life, we can’t control who loves us back.
I’m not allowing myself to go back into my safe zone, I’ll keep on going on dates, getting to know both the girls I go out with and myself.
But also I’m not allowing myself to beg for love or to behave in an ungentlemanly and unhealthy way, for respect both of me and of the women I date.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in Missouri. I have been trying to change the status quo, but everything seems simple. In some uncertain times, I became very bad.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

About me-I am an independent woman. I have a failed marriage and I always believe that people who like to gamble must not have a unique love. My predecessor was a gambler, and he lost everything in just a few months. I think this is very sad. What I want to accompany him now is a cold prison bed. So I dislike gambling. After the divorce, I moved to this legendary city. I have my own business and my own unique and clean friends. I usually like sports. Travel, golf, swimming, reading, food and shopping, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have no feelings in life, but to be honest, my recent work and life are a bit bad for me, so I am looking for someone. I am an optimist, but because I passed, let myself not relax, I want to change myself and hope to contact some friends. I live in St. Louis because I can’t meet my friends. I hope I can meet more friends in the United States or Canada. After the epidemic, we can eat something meaningful. I am 36 years old. I believe that many people will mature and experience this era. Due to my work, if I haven't recovered for a long time, please forgive me, it doesn't mean that I don't want to talk, it's just for me. Say that my job is everything to me at the moment. However, I will try my best to maintain the dialogue.

Long story short, I 25M met a few girls in college who are friends with one of my close friends that’s a 26F, I’ll call her Hanna. Hanna and I have been close friends for awhile and confide in each other on several occasions, but we’re just friends and we’ve established that’s all we will ever be, so she’s basically like a sister to me.

Anyway, one of the girls from our mutual friend group expressed interest to Hanna that she’s interested in me. So, Hanna told me that she’s interested, but has also told me about her past and how we’re probably incompatible. Hanna also told me that this girl hooks up with many people and it usually happens on the first or second date and has stated how openly sex positive she is.

Now, Hanna and I had a conversation about this a couple nights ago and she advised me again about her past, and how she believes her and I would be incompatible as boyfriend and girlfriend. I expressed to her that I tend to agree, but I’d still kind of like to give it a shot and even told her that I wouldn’t mind having sex with her, but hanna advised me against it. She then told me that she would really hate to see me lose my virginity to this girl and thinks I deserve better and should wait for the right one, but said again that it’s my decision. 

My question is, I really don’t want to ruin anything as far as the friendship I have with Hanna, for going against what she thinks is best for me, but I’d also like to experience sex, especially that we both know it would happen frequently. It’s one of those situations where I’m probably thinking with the wrong head, but I can’t stop thinking about all of the sex I’d get with this girl. I feel torn about what to do. Advice?

83,qgersv,1635278292,Should I write a letter explaining something that happened 10+ years ago?,"So when I was 14 I was dating a boy and we were super in love. Dated for a year. Unfortunately my grandma was racist and very abusive(she had custody of me) and he was black. She caught us kissing and basically told me that if I didn't break up with him then I would be sent to a mental institution, and she would call his parents (who were strict) and tell them that he raped me and that she would press charges on him for rape. She said he gave me diseases and that I had to break it off and she didn't care how. So I tried to push it off as long as possible but it ended being virtually impossible to talk to him or his sister (who was a good friend) without my grandma hovering and demanding to know if I was talking to any black boys. I had a rough childhood....parents on drugs and absent, sexual assault, abusive grandmother. So when it came to breaking up, I guess I didn't have the right words to convey how damaged I was and what was happening so I made up a lie and said that I was moving away and we had to break up. Naturally, he was devastated,  even more so when weeks went by and I was still there. He tried to get back with me and I was terrified so I said no. I basically shot down everything he tried. This severely messed my head up and actually caused me to spiral into a deep depression. I just would up actually moving to get away from how ashamed I was. I never told the guy the truth. Well, he never deleted me off of Facebook and a couple months ago he was selling an Xbox on facebook and I needed one so I offered to buy it. He came to my place but didn't come inside. We just stood outside and kept hugging and talking. He told me several times that I looked really good. He also said that he was in a relationship with someone he wasn't too sure about but that they were gonna try living together. I am single, but I have an 8 year old daughter(full custody). But my feelings for him never went away. I never wanted us to break up and I have thought about him constantly over the years. I think that he and his girlfriend recently broke up (neither of their social media's have each other on them and hers used to have him) and I was considering writing a letter explaining what happened when we were teenagers, but I am conflicted. We are both now 28 years old. I just don't know if I sound like a crazy person for wanting him to know that I didn't mean for any of that to happen and I would love a second chance.

84,qgez2m,1635278847,Why do guys cry about height preferences when they theme selves have height preferences,"I’m 5’8.5 and decided to let go of the society standards that men have to be taller and I decided to date men my height or shorter .

I’m not joking but 85-90 percent of them told me not to wear high heels and to sit down in photos because my height is unphotogenic .

So this taught me guys  don’t like being shorter than their girl friends or around the same height .

So for the short guys when you get emasculated by women taller than you or similar height you reinforce the stereotypes that hurt you and work against you .Then you will complain about women dismissing you for you’re height .


Obviously women can be quite harsh to short man which isn’t cool and I’m doing my best to let go of that cycle however no one talks about men who are emasculated by women’s height .",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/qgez2m/why_do_guys_cry_about_height_preferences_when/

Most of the time they see me as friends, a select few say they’ll give it a go but then a week in they send the “I’m not ready for a relationship” sort of thing which I know they’re saying to make me feel better but it doesn’t let me know what I do wrong. 

In the small chance I do get a relationship the person is never a good match for me and I usually get hurt at the end. All of my close friends say I deserve better but the only times people have agreed to dating me they end up being horrible to me a couple months in. 

I don’t know what I do wrong, I don’t know if it’s because I’m overweight a little bit or if it’s the way I look or if it’s just because I’m too nice to people.

90,qgfc1f,1635279838,Should I go on?,"There's a girl that's been a friend of mine since some months ago. She is good looking and super nice, but Idk if I should hook with her because I don't have much perspective of staying with her on the long run. Also, sometimes I feel attracted to her, but sometimes I don't. It really varies depending on the day.

My friends put some expectations on me as well, and they are trying to make it work, and I genuinely think I have a great chance of hooking up with her in the end, but again, Idk if I should.

I'm saying it because I know she suffers from anxiety, and other friend of mine also hooked with her for a while, again with no intention of long-term relationship. (Btw I talked to him and he said it's ok for me to hook with her, he even wants to help me). I just think not going for the long run might take a toll on her mental health, especially if she knows I'm not all that attracted to her. 

Just to make things worse, I feel really attracted to her sister, who is a bit younger (one is 19, the other is 17) but she never gets out of her house and my friend is much, much more socially active than her sister. My friend always hangs out with us, but her sister rarely does. Still very nice and intelligent as well. And also their parents are too controlling. Like, a lot. Their autonomy is very restricted, and they normally they have to tell most of the things they do if their parents ask.

I know here on reddit we like to pretend that leagues don’t exist but she is out of his league…like waaaay out. I am sure she was him for money (his parents are filthy rich) and he buys  her way too much stuff.. even so, i still felt proud of my boy for being able to pull her. But that all changed when he revealed to me that they still haven’t slept together. They have been going out for about 6 weeks but he said she keeps saying “she’s not ready to get physical just yet”. Lol the same girl who is comfortable enough to hang out alone with him at his dorm almost every single day and who is comfortable enough to accept all the shit he buys for her just “isn’t comfortable” enough to fuck him. I tried several times to explain to him that if she’s still not willing to have sex with him after all this time they’ve spent together, it means she is not physically attracted to him, but he wasn’t having it. I believe that if someone is physically attracted to you, sure they might be able to resist for a while but eventually they just won’t be able to stop themselves especially since they hang out (just the two of them) in a dorm room almost everyday after school. I tried to tell him he was being used but he was hell bent on giveinh her “as much time as she needs to feel comfortable”…he even got pissed at me. Well today i saw her leaving one of my neighbor/friend’s room around 7am lolololol. When i asked my neighbor about her, he said they have been sleeping together for a while now. I told mark and he confronted her about it, she tried to lie but she eventually admitted it and tried apologizing. Long story short, he is a mess. I will be there for him during the next few days but immediately the pain wears off, i will make fun of him well so that he learns from this.

Things now are a lot more calmer. There is less passion, there is less energy, good energy, flowing between us, but there is still love and willingness to keep trying

But we dont know what else we can try to make things fun and refreshing again. I know the honeymoon phase ends, but she says ""I know that initial phase doesn't last forever, but with my exs I always felt excited about meeting them and being with them, but with you I don't get that.

Before me, she had 3 serious relationships: 2 good ones that lasted for 4 and 3 years, and 1 toxic one that ended last year, but lasted 3 years also. Since then she has been to therapy for a while, but isn't going anymore

Could it be that she is trying to protect herself and not letting herself open up to me and feel loved? Are we just not compatible? What can we try to make things exciting again?

99,qgg31b,1635281897,"Anyone else had to delete all dating apps because they felt they were being addicted to the ""chase?""","I am someone who has started using dating apps last November (2020), and have had little to no success on them. I am not writing this as a pity post because I have had hundreds of matches since I started and have definitely had opportunities to go on dates with women I found attractive (that I obviously didn't capitalize upon, due to anxiety/depression. In fact, I have never even been on a date from a dating app in the US, other than when I went to Colombia earlier in the year). My point is that very recently, I felt that I was literally addicted to the concept of getting a like or a match on a dating app: I would constantly check my phone to see if I had a new match/message, on all the 3 apps that I was using (Hinge, Bumble, Tinder). And while in the most recent months I've been using pretty much only Hinge (I would get 3-4 matches a week), all the conversations with my matches would never go anywhere: even if I got them off the app via phone number the conversations would always die once they ghosted me or I proposed a date. I guess I kind of realized that online dating isn't really for me (and I wouldn't even say I'm ugly, I'm average looking), because I would subconsciously be addicted to the validation of dating app likes and messages. And even when I did get a match with a really attractive girl that 30 second buzz would fade because I always knew that that conversation would go nowhere/I would get ghosted. In a sense, I was addicted to a feeling of validation that I consciously realized didn't matter because I internalized the fact that those matches would never go anywhere. It was like a tease of what I COULD have if I actually had the confidence to approach these women in person. Anyone else have a similar experience, and if you did, how did you manage to overcome it or feel better?
