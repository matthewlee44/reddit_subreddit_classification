0,rwylx4,1641421781,Having trouble in the dating scene in 2022. Can anyone offer me some help/advice?,"Ok, hear me out folks.

I'm a guy who's now 27 years old living overseas in Eastern Europe and I'm trying to get used to the dating scene here. In America, dating was vapid for me in large part because of my disabilities *(ADHD + Aspergers).* In my personal experience, these women were extremely picky and superficial. Personally, I blame Instagram, TikTok and Tinder which has skewed the minds of both men and women due to the near unlimited access they have to people now. There's also an abundance of choice like never before and as such, the women back home *(USA)* tended to only go for the best looking men, especially if they were really attractive themselves. Not willing to give an average or slightly above average looking guy like me a chance. 

Beyond this, the fact remains is that I'm an introvert and not really into social media like most people are. I tend to live a more quiet life and I'm into gaming, manga, anime and whatnot. I'm also a Christian and a churchgoer at that, which most people back in America aren't these days, much less any woman I was attracted to. :(

A hell of a lot of people who use Instagram in my experience can be quite toxic. They'll always post about some extravagant thing in their life and the people I know who use it are ALWAYS doing something outlandish such as vacationing to the Caribbean or Southeast Asia and frankly, I wouldn't want to go on dates and having to take pics or have my GF have the camera in our faces all the time. It's just not my style to be perfectly honest.

I've said this before in past posts. All that I'm looking for is a woman who's traditional, conservative and Christian like me. A couple of friends of mine told me awhile back that if a woman uses Instagram or TikTok, then she's not going to be either of those and from what I can see, it's kind of true. Could be wrong however and I'd hope I am.

That said, I am seriously left wondering where in *mainstream* society can I find attractive women around my age who don't use Instagram or at least not on it all the time? Someone who's more down to Earth and mostly spending time off the smart phone, casually chilling out instead?

1,rwynqo,1641421903,Texting in a Long Distance Relationship?,"Hi everyone.  
I've (M25) met a girl (F24) online via a dating site about 3 or 4 weeks ago. We are both students in University.  
She lives like 200 miles down south (UK) so it's mostly been texting and google meets.  
We have a lot in common, and it's been amazing getting to know her. We aren't officially dating yet.  
In all my past relationships and even friendships, I've mostly been a texter. I usually respond within a few minutes unless I'm at work or asleep.

  
But she usually takes a couple of hours to respond, meaning we don't really get to text much in a day.  


This makes me feel like she isn't into me, although we flirt and spend hours on video calls, usually once or twice a week.  
Is it normal for some people to just not text much despite meeting someone they are exited to talk to? Because usually when I meet someone new, there have been times where I have stayed up all night texting them.

I will probably be visiting her in person towards the end of this month.

Thanks in advance",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rwynqo/texting_in_a_long_distance_relationship/

6,rwzb6m,1641423578,Randomly ended after 2 months.,"So me (26M) met this girl (20F) in November rather unexpectedly and not planned. We hit it off like nothing I’ve ever experienced before both emotionally and sexually and had so much in common.

We’d meet every weekend since we first met and did things that included trips to new places, long drives, nights out drinking and staying in a hotel for the night. After Christmas I let her around mine and she enjoyed seeing me so much she stayed an extra night even though she had work early the next day and was 30 mins from hers.

During this time she told me how she’s never met anyone like me before, she enjoyed seeing me so much, she told all her friends and family about me and we even had plans to travel to new places in the new year and how she couldn’t wait to start the year with me. She made it clear I couldn’t ever be a FWB and could only ever see me as someone she’s be in a relationship with. 

It then took a turn and felt rather weird on 2nd January and we hardly spoke but I put it down to her being busy with work. 

The next day we had a conversation in which she claimed to not being sure about seeing/being with me as she was scared to trust/be vulnerable again after some bad experiences and she thought she hadn’t been single long enough (4 months) and didn’t wanna hurt me and wanted to stop things. She felt confused and her head was all over the place in which I sent a long message explaining my feels but respected her need for space and that’s id leave it and won’t message her again.

It’s now been two days and we have not spoke and I’ve been left very confused as this has never happened to me before? I don’t believe someone can feel the way she said she did about me and then be able to switch off so easily? All the plans we spoke about? Even telling her friends and family which I knew was true due to messages I’d been shown and Snapchat videos of her family asking about me.

I certainly won’t be messaging her as I know this won’t do my mental state any good but I’m constantly wonder if she will message me again in a day? Or a week? Or never again?

Any advice on how to deal with this or if she was being truthful would be appreciated as I feel this is more painful and confusing than when my 4 year relationship ended.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rwzb6m/randomly_ended_after_2_months/

15,rx08pe,1641425972,FML as a bald guy,"It's all a lie. Society tells us that if you are attractive then dating is easier. If you're handsome, funny &amp; have an amazing body, you have it made right?

Not in my experience. It's all a lie.

My face is very attractive, my body is ripped from years of lifting weights. I dress very well and have a great sense of humor. I'm not simply saying ""I'm attractive"", it's evidenced by beautiful women staring at me wherever I go....while wearing a hat.

I've been single my entire life. I had a pretty traumatic childhood, so I just avoided people in general for the first 20 years of life. I never dated in school, I didn't have any real friends. 

I decided one day to change all of that, I began lifting weights and improving myself in any way I could.
I became who I am today, a muscular white guy of average height with a handsome face.

But that doesn't matter....none of it matters.

I decided to start online dating, it seemed easy enough. I set out and took 6 very high quality pictures doing different things in each one. I created a very diverse dating profile with a witty bio. It all seemed so perfect.
Unfortunately, no one told me that none of this stuff matters when you're bald. Zero matches. Zero dates. Zero chances at happiness.

Women love flirting with me in public with my hat on, but without social skills I simply cannot ask them out. I am clueless what to say. I usually just walk away awkwardly, unable to think of anything. 

That's where the idea of online dating came into play. I thought I'd just workout like crazy and then it would be easy to go on dates. 

Hell no! 

Women won't give me a chance. Heavy women won't even give me a chance online.
I've lowered my standards to rock bottom, but can't get a date or a phone number to save my life.

All I've ever wanted my entire life was to have a girlfriend. All I've ever wanted was a true connection and of course sex. But no...love and affection isn't for me apparently.

Had I known this, I wouldn't have ever began lifting weights or improving myself. It was all a waste of time &amp; money. 
All I ever see are guys who don't care about their appearance/body/clothes with beautiful women as girlfriends/wives.

It just boils my blood that I can't even have a glimmer of hope. It crushes my soul and has cast me into a deep depression.

I wish I were dead. It's all I ever dream about anymore. The thought of death is the only thing I can find happiness in now. There is nothing majorly wrong with me, in theory I should at least be allowed to go on one date with a below average girl....but nope....not for me.

It really hasn't been extensive conservation, just mainly about college, and recently, how hard its been to meet people in college. We're in our second year of the course, but last semester was the first semester we were on campus. We haven't actually met face to face yet, mainly due to the course being so big, and us both being fairly shy. I did mention however, that after Christmas I'll introduce myself and say hello, and she seemed pretty happy. 

I recently signed up for a couple of dating apps as I've been feeling a tad lonely lately and would really love to meet someone (I've never been in a relationship before). So today I was swiping through and guess who pops up. 

My dilemma is that I don't know what way to swipe. If I swipe right I'm admitting I'd be interested in a relationship, but I'm not sure if that would be wierd (that's if she'd even know). Should I swipe right and see what comes of it, or wait until we get back to college in January and try work something out face to face.

We finally had our first in-person date today, and it lasted about three hours (went to a restaurant, got yogurt, and walked around our college campus). I was very quiet and awkward, so internally I suspected there wouldn’t be a second date. We ended the date at her apartment, because I had promised to help her move some stuff. After moving things, I asked if I should stay or go, and she said “you choose”. This gave me the sense that she wanted me to stay, so I went back in with her and sat down. She then sat down across from me and asked if I was staying or going, since I was just sitting there quietly. Since I’m completely clueless and have never been alone with a woman in a romantic context before, for some reason I took this to mean she wanted me to go. So I said bye and left.

When I got home, I asked if she’d like to go on another date, to which she responded “you were supposed to ask to stay and watch Netflix.” She said I made her feel embarrassed and that I shouldn’t come back to her apartment today, as I offered to once she told me this. I apologized profusely since I am socially clueless, and I asked why she felt embarrassed. She told me not to ask her directly why and to instead search the internet for an answer to my question.

I posted on the discord and got some nice words but I wanted to get multiple perspectives.

I took a trip to see old friends and her(It's originally my hometown) I feel like we had a really incredible time, I met her kids and all goes well.

I got back home and sent her a text more or less saying that I had a wonderful time and i'd love to see her again, she said something akin to ""I enjoyed your company and i'd like to see you again someday"" but she also said she was busy(full time mom, full time school etc) I'm okay with this and say as much.

Today I tried to schedule a phone call with her to try and make plans for another trip I might take in mid February and I got told over text ""School just started today, kids start school tomorrow and I can't plan anything right now""

I answered(maybe stupidly) that that's fine I'm still interested in seeing her on her timings and that if she wasn't interested in the end I'd understand. She hasn't answered since.

I feel really stupid, maybe I came on too strongly? I don't really know if this is salvageable and if it is I don't really know what to do... I'd appreciate any advice or perspectives.

When they both reached out this week asking if I was still interested I was initially elated and wanted to respond yes but part of me couldn’t help that all they were doing was using me as a backup option, their first option didn’t workout and they were lying about not seeing me at original proposed time so I ghosted them both.

At first it felt really empowering but now I feel like I may have screwed up to potential dates with wonderful woman because of how I perceive them based on my fears of being played. 

It made me realize a lot of my dating past is effecting how I see women now and I have to take a step back from dating. They didn’t do anything to have that burden placed on them. Really sucks but I’m glad I saw it.

We only dated for a few months, were just getting to know each other, he acted so into me, and it's so hard for me to like someone. I was really enjoying getting to know him, but I kept myself guarded, where he was a lot more open with me. I had just met his friends, he wanted to take a trip together, he wanted me to meet his mom in the weeks before this. Like he was fully all-in. Then one day he freaked out because he was confused about his feelings and whether he could see a future with me or be in love with me.

This is was so confusing to me, because I've never been in love (something he doesn't know about me). I can't possibly know if I'm in love after a few months. I haven't even really revealed deeper things about myself yet. I was just starting to get more comfortable letting him in. I expressed to him that I thought it was too soon to have those feelings (he was really upset, emotional, crying about it whereas I was totally calm) and we talked it out. He agreed he was panicking and putting so much pressure on the future for no reason. At one point he said ""what if it's been 3-4 years and we're not in love and we wasted all that time?"" I was like, ""why are you worrying about that? We are taking things slow. It's not wasted time to see how things go, that's what dating is.""

He didn't have a girlfriend until he was 30 and she was toxic and emotionally abusive to him. They only lasted a year. I'm his second ever girlfriend. When we talked about it, he admitted he just got himself all worked up that us not being more serious so early in was a red flag and he panicked. We agreed to just be in the moment and see how things go. I'm more comfortable at a slower pace than his ex was.

Then he freaked out again a few days later and that's when we ended things. That last time I didn't argue, I was just like well, you've heard what I think about this, if this is what you want, okay.

That was 7 weeks ago and we've been in No Contact since. The thing is, I'm still crushed. I've done the work. I'm working on myself, got in great shape, dating other people, etc. And I still miss him because I think he's a great person and I completely understand where his anxiety is coming from. I have regrets that maybe I should have been more vulnerable with him or fought for us again that second time instead of just agreeing to the breakup. I was hoping he'd reach out to me once he got his head together but because he's so anxious/shy, he probably thinks he screwed it all up and it's beyond repair, even if he's now sad about it. He spent his whole life avoiding relationships because of his fear/anxiety and depression.

I want to reach out because I think we had something really great and he just panicked and overreacted. I feel like I have nothing to lose because if I do reach out and he doesn't want to talk/hasn't missed me over the last two months, I think that means he was right and we're not right for each other. I don't think I'd be any more sad than I am right now. I've given him space to think about what he wants and while I wish he'd reach out, I feel like his anxiety and non-confrontational nature won't let him.

But what's stopping me is that maybe I haven't given him enough time. This weekend marks 8 weeks since we've seen each other, next week 8 weeks since we've spoken. So what do you think? Should I give him more time to see if he realizes it on his own (maybe at the 3 month mark) or should I just reach out and see if he'd be interested in talking things through and seeing if this is worth another shot?

Also, he hasn't been dating (we met on a dating app, his profile is still inactive), he posted on social media things that felt like they were to get my attention (he hadn't posted in 3 years prior), and his mom watched my Instagram story a couple weeks ago (we've never met and she doesn't follow me so she had to seek me out). So I feel like I'm at least somewhat on his mind.

TLDR: Ex ended things out of nowhere after panicking about our potential future and now that it's been 2 months no contact, I want to reach out and see how he feels about it. I don't think he'll reach out first because he's got bad anxiety/low self-esteem. I don't feel like I'd be any more sad if I found out he's really not interested, as I miss him a lot now even though I've focused on myself/dated other people. It could actually make me feel better, as I'd stop wondering if I could have changed things. But I don't know if I should wait longer and see if he comes to me first. He's just such a sweet person but he's letting his anxiety/overthinking run his life.

So I’m[M] in quite a pickle with this girl right now[F23]. We met through mutual friends in September and talked at a party and I asked for her snap. After that we started exchanging some snaps here and there, nothing serious. Until one day in October when we started talking more and I eventually asked her out.

We went on a date, I was really really nervous, and she admitted was aswell afterwards. But we both had a really good time. We went on another date afterwards. The thing is I work at sea, and due to Covid quarantines and stuff I have worked alot the last months. Since mid September I’ve been at home a total of 20 days and spent the rest of the time on a ship.

We have still talked alot with each other and I’ve grown really fond of her and started developing a heavy crush. I’m bound to go home in a few weeks and have one and a half month leave. Now I’m wondering if I should ask her currently how things are between us, if she is up to meet still once I get home or whats up. I usually dont put alot of weight on dating girls as they come and go lol. But this one has really caught me and I can’t stop thinking about the situation.

Tldr: Talked alot with a really nice girl, I work at sea and have been working like crazy the last months. Should I tell her how I feel or will it just scare her away.

35,rx1t0a,1641430152,Girl seems on the fence about relationship?,"So there’s this girl who I’ve known for about 4ish years, we started talking like two months ago and we’ve gone on 5 dates and have our 6th date set for this weekend. At first she said she didn’t want a relationship, then we met up in person and after talking  about she said  we could see where things go, but my gut is telling me she’s just not taking things seriously.

Like when we’re together it’s cool, but she just doesn’t seem that interested over text. I went on vacation for 3 weeks, and she responded to my story like 3 times, but I would try to have like a normal text conversation and she gave me a super dry answer. I was thinking of laying everything out when I see her bc I don’t want to act and her get the boyfriend perks, I feel like I’m genuine thoughtful, a good listener, i pay for our dates (bc j want to), and I care about what she has to say.

She’s mentioned how much she thinks I’m attractive and wants to fuck me, she makes me feel super desirable but it just seems superficial in a way I guess. I feel like she’s a good person but I have to guess that maybe she’s damaged or has some trauma to deal with bc I guess both her parents left her, she’s an only child, and raised herself bc her grandparents are really old. 

I could see myself in a relationship with her, but I’m not going to waste my time if it doesn’t seem like it’s something she genuinely wants. I’m thinking of telling her this and maybe I’m being too dramatic but there are similar signs from the last girl I was seeing where they just want a sort of boyfriend without any commitment and when I stop becoming fun or exciting, it’s on to the next.

This is just how I feel so this might not be the case, but what do you think?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rx1t0a/girl_seems_on_the_fence_about_relationship/

I am doing some self reflecting and I realized this is the most serious adult relationship I have been in (24F and 29M) and I am curious as to how other couples spend their free time. 

Last week both me and my partner had a week off (not living together) and I chose to go over to his apartment to spend the week (he happily had me over, we spend most weekends at his). He was happy to play video games with his friends from waking up to going to bed and we would eat meals together and watch a TV show before cuddling to sleep. I know I am on the needier side and am currently looking for a new hobby (I am currently in therapy and recognize this about myself) so I felt a bit isolated/ ignored by him. At no point was I actually neglected by him, as everything I asked to play a game or watch something together he happily complied. But it did become apparent that while he was happy to be hanging out in the same room, I only felt that fulfillment in doing activities together.

We met up the night he messaged me and went to dinner and a movie. We had a great time and we planned to get together again soon. He ghosted me for a week (weird?) but actually reached back out with a phone call and a text explaining his situation. I truly felt bad for him, he seemed to be going through a depression or something and maybe felt he needed a break from life and isolated.

I gave him the benefit of the doubt, I had already chalked it up to never seeing the guy again and my self esteem plummeted because the date was so great I was dumbfounded. Anyway, we see each other two times in a row (2nd and 3rd date) in a week. Things get pretty hot and heavy and I’m suddenly really into him. I feel like we have lots of potential. We even schedule our 4th date which was yesterday. We went out to dinner, we had a couple drinks and we hung out at his place. 

He made a sly comment like “how soon is too soon to see each other again?” And I felt like he didn’t mean that in good taste but he has initiated every date so I took it as, he really likes me and is trying to slow the breaks or maybe things are going too fast and he needs space? No idea. Regardless, the date went very well. After he walked me to my car and hugged me goodnight I drove home and he did not ask me if I made it back which was uncharacteristic of him since he has done that on every other date, it was also like 1AM.. I texted him anyways and told him I made it back and we’ve texted today briefly…(also uncharacteristic since we usually text throughout the day)

I can’t tell if I scared the dude off or he needs space or what gives but for 4 dates in, I feel like I should have more certainty. I’ve decided (if we make plans) I am going to be straight up with him before we plan a next date and ask if he sees potential in us or if I should move on. Am I reading too much into this? I hate feeling like I don’t know where someone stands with me but I’m not a forward person and I don’t want to push him after just 4 dates.

I have gone on A LOT of dates the past 2 years but have a hard time finding someone I like. This is the longest I have been seeing anyone ever and it is making me realise how new it all is to me. I just have a lot of questions.

He literally acts perfect but personality-wise he isn't usually the type of guy I am attracted to. I often have doubts, doubts about how much I like him, doubts about how much he likes me.

 When I go on a date usually I can see on a guys face that he is into me, but with this guy I would have no clue if he liked me or not if he didn't say it to me. He initiates stuff often enough but has never compliments me apart from calling me cute once. I get compliments from strangers often enough and it kinda hurts that a stranger will give me a compliment be he won't. I'm never really sure if he's being genuine when he says he likes me, he says it with a straight face and is very hard to read. I can't tell if he is unsure and just saying what he needs to get more time to decide. He has only been in one relationship before.

 I was also really attracted to him at first but feel less attracted to him than before even though he is exactly my type physically. Little things he does bother me soemtimes (like him being restless or going on a long tangent about work) Usually when I like a guy I just naturally start to like everything about them, that hasn't happened with this guy. 

I ussualy feel good about things when I'm with him and when I get home but start doubting things and being unsure when I spend a week without seeing him. The idea of never seeing him again really upsets me but at the same time I'm not confident about how I feel. I have gone out with so many guys and was not romantically attracted to anyone, I dont want to lose interest in this guy or to scare him away. Usually it is very obvious when I don't like someone, I have never gone out for a second date or been in this weird middle ground.

 Idk if I feel less attracted to him and unsure because I feel like he is not attracted to me? Are we in a loop where both of us are not confident in our feelings and are therefore making each other less confident and less interested?

He gets jealous over me etc. I told him I'm okay with waiting and I'm fine with either out come as he's a good person encouraging my growth. Plus he gives really good dick. 

Lately he's been getting really into my hobbies and he's been making time to see me every day for the past two weeks. He's gotten me equipment so I can play video games with him (mic, games and even offered to drop off his expensive gaming laptop at mine) 

I met his parents and had dinner with them. When I told my friend all about this she said that what I'm doing is insane and I'm just going to be hurt later down the road. 

I told her that I'm aware of it but the positive experience outweighs the possible heart break. 

Now I'm doubting things, I know that I enjoy time and I'd like to ride this out but I'm worried what others will think.

We have been friends for 3 years now. At one point, I was very much into her and had asked her out. But she said that she sees me only as a friend and nothing more. This was a year ago.

However, for the last couple of months, whenever we meet, she sits close to me. Touches my arm often. Comments sexual innuendos and makes sexual jokes everytime we meet (in a group or individually). Compliments my shirt and laughs at my worst jokes. The other day, her leg was touching my thigh as she was laying on the couch near me. I asked her to straighten her leg. She put her leg on my thigh. I instinctively put my hand on her leg and near the thigh. She didn't move it away. She kept it that way for the next hour. And she adjusted herself so that more of her leg could rest on my thigh.

I don't know if she's just being comfortable with me or I am supposed to consider this as hints. I think it is the former. I don't want to jeopardize the friendship by asking her about dating again. I on the other hand have started having some feelings for her.

What do you think is happening here?

I've never really been particularly close to my sister. And my mom I'm on good terms with. But recently they've been getting really weird about me dating. At first it was just the innocent little 'you should find a wife already' Which okay thats just playful ribbing.

But lately its been getting weird. 

They know my plans to move to Alaska. And they keep telling me 'Ugh, why would you want to move there? Theres no women up there.' Which wasn't the reason I want to move there in the first place. but thats a whole another conversation.

Then they got my aunts and my grandmother involved. And one day I came home from work, and theres a girl in the living room who I don't recognize. And they basically set me up on a blind date without telling me anything.

I never felt so uncomfortable in my life, mostly because I wasn't even warned. But also because they got my other relatives involved.

Because of that, I've been spending some time working overtime. But each weekend its the same thing. 

I'm still living at home because since I left active duty I came back to figure out my next step. And I'm moving out to Alaska in two months, got a new job and a house all lined up there. 

My sister in particular is trying to tell me she 'needs nieces and nephews.' and its not that I don't want kids eventually. But I never even considered the option until i was at least 30.

I'm an interesting person. I'm witty, smart, and decent looking enough. But first dates feel like they don't allow for much of that to shine through. I think I'm at my best with a group of people. Even if they're strangers, it's really easy for me to bounce off of everyone in the group and have a good laugh. But with a one-on-one first meeting, it just feels wrong. Have you ever seen Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind? The way I interact with people is a lot like Clementine when she's first talking to Joel in the beginning scene. I'm a bit quirky (hopefully not in a cringey way) but it feels difficult to express that in a first date environment. I usually go out for coffee because it's easy, affordable, and low-pressure, but it feels *so boring*. It's like I could go on a coffee date with anyone and come back with basically the same experience. I've been ice skating as a first date before as well, and that one was also pretty boring, even though I love ice skating. I have been on *one* interesting first date where we just went out to eat and then walked around the town for a bit sightseeing/chatting. But even then, that feels much harder to pull of and has to be organic I think.

I guess what I'm asking is if others feel this way? I have a coffee date lined up with a girl in a few days, and I reeeaallly like her and don't want it to turn into another boring date that deters either of us.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rx5jiq/are_first_dates_always_so_stiff/

&amp;#x200B;

So Me n this girl, Recently we have been having some trouble. Alright Few months back, We started dating and It we talked about 2 Months, I really liked her, So i confessed, First time and She confessed too. Things went smooth, Until we started getting into arguments, not bigs but over small things which caused us to break up. So, I really did miss her and my friend was talking to her, not Like he liked her cuz he already had a Gf but He was talking to her cuz of me, I asked him to send mth i wanted her to know, And it was mainly because i did really miss her. After, She told us she was moving, Which i got sad for a bit, But then im like it' fine. So I said ""hi"" And she responded, I didn't expect her to at all. So She gave me 1 Week to get her back, Dk why but i thought it was werid, Aight i failed that but then i Told her sm things which made her switch her desision and she didn't tell me that at all, i thought we were friends. Aight, I asked her, What do you think of me, She said ""Bf, Future husband, With a 9 Year old mind (Mainly cuz i did dumb shit before). Okay, Few weeks later, Another breakup occurs, All because of me, I really do want to stab my self for that but it was because every Plan i made wit her, Last min she told she can't do it due to strict parents or Someone else issue she needs to solve, So We broke up. So late night i was trying to sleep, and Everytime i tried, Thoughts of her, ANd i was't trying to think about her at all, So im like ""wtf is going on with me"". I dmed her, She wasn't interested in me anymore And I said My bye's to her and last time we will see/Talk to each other. 20 Mins later, I recieved a text from her, Im like alright, And she was being Rude as f, I was being nice, Didn't say much. okay after, Im like 'Alright Did you really want to text me or not, Ill go with whatever you pick"" Because she was pissing me off, But i was holding it in. She said ""Wbu"" Im lke ""Idc, You pick."". and she said ""Yes"" Surprised. Alright  We talked normally for a bit until she texted me ""Im going to sleep, Bye"" Im like alright, 30 Mins later she texted me she couldn't sleep, And then we went into smth else, So basically, She had this nickname for me Which she only called me cuz She loved me and it was only for her, Idk if that makes sense but She made that nickname for me. So we went into nicknames for each other and she didn't list it, She's like ""{Nickname} won't be used anymore, only for your next girl"", I left her on seen and she said ""hi"" and i said ""hi"" We talked for a bit and I had a bit depression so, She noticed that. Aight, After talking about it a bit, She called me the nickname, And now she uses it everyday. I don't get it but how do i exatly get her back? And i don't know if she still has feelings for me or not. I get why was she trying to be rude, But Im still confused.

I’m very inexperienced about sex but I feel like I have a strong chemistry with this guy. Other than this, I dont see we have a lot of things in common and this relationship cannot go beyond fwb.

After we start our fwb relationship, the guy texts me more often. He cooks everytime he visits my apartment, and always acts like he is very caring about. Recently, I found out he has been lying to me about one of his ex. He was cheated by this woman many times but still loves her the most as he thinks he cannot find someone understanding better than her. This guy told me he no longer talk to his ex as she cheated and hurt him many times. But I figured out he still texts and hang out with that woman. When I ask if he is flirting with any woman now, he always says No. 


My confusion is I’m not sure why he lies to me about this if he truly considers me as a fwb only. And should I tell him that I already know about all his lies and I cannot accept his behaviors? I tried to ask many open question to give him hints that I know about his lies. But everytime, he always try to cover and re-confirm with me that he will never see his ex again.

87,rx6doq,1641446003,Help With an Ex,"My ex and I got together during our senior year of high school, 2019-2020. Our relationship was perfect: we did everything together, never got sick of each other, loved each other to the fullest, and gave our relationship our all. We rarely fought, and when we did, we would handle it very maturely by talking it out and giving each other space and what not. We grew so much together and individually and learned so much about ourselves during our 2 year relationship. When it was time to go off to college, we went to different schools across the state. Our relationship worked because I was still at home doing online learning, while she moved in to a very busy schedule and campus life. We did long distance for a whole year, which wasn't ideal but it was always ok since I was still at home and could talk/facetime whenever we wanted thanks to online learning. 

This most recent Fall quarter of 2021 was different because now it was my turn to move into the college life, in addition to her schedule getting exponentially busier.  As the quarter went on, it got to a point where we were just sort of ""passing by"" each other through text and didn't get to FaceTime all that much. We both started to feel like our relationship wasn't much of a relationship at that point anymore, but neither of us had lost any feelings for each other at all. We just sort of knew that the best and most mature thing to do was to have a clean break up before things turned sour or before we lost feelings and give each other space to continue our hectic schedules and explore more of college. 

I finished off the quarter feeling a little sting that she was no longer in my life, but it ultimately wasn't too bad since I had so many distractions to keep my head occupied. Right now, it's winter break and I haven't stopped thinking about her at all. Since the breakup, we hadn't talked to each other at all until Christmas when she wished me a Merry Christmas and I did the same back. On New Year's Eve, she asked to drop some stuff off and to see me. We both admitted that we still missed each other A LOT and that we still want to be together and have feelings for each other, but we know that our schedules are only going to get busier. We ended our talk saying that we'll make it through until Spring Break or until school is over for the year and reconvene and see how we're feeling about us, but ultimately focus on ourselves until then.

Since our talk, I got COVID so I have nothing else to do but sit here and reminisce on our relationship or think about our talk or think about our future together or wanting to text her and I'm just losing my damn mind over here lol. 

So my question here is what should I do? Do I say fuck it and give into my emotions and give our relationship another shot or do I follow through with what we said and wait until spring break/summer to see how we feel? Or do I not do either of those and just tuck my feelings for her away and let ""if it's meant to be, it's meant to be"" take the wheel and let our paths cross after college and focus on myself?

Idk if any of this even makes sense, maybe I'm just going insane because I'm quarantined with nothing to do and being at home reminds me of her. Maybe all I need is to get back into my college routine with distractions so I naturally wouldn't think about her. All I know is that she means the world to me and no other girl that I've met at college compares to her and I really don't want to mess anything up with her so please help!!!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rx6doq/help_with_an_ex/

I decided to give online dating ago since I don’t go out much and therefore don’t get the chance to meet many people. I matched with this guy who is 25 years old and we had a great conversation. We shared so much in common and the conversation was flowing. I asked him what his intentions are and he said his looking for a serious relationship which what I’m also looking for. We went out on one date and I enjoyed myself he was very charming. The only problem is are age gap. If he actually wants a serious relationship as he said why go for a 19 year old girl?? I’m mature but still it doesn’t make sense to me. I have asked him about the age gap and if it’s an issue he replied saying that It’s not an issue to him. What do you guys think of the situation?? We both have the same intentions but I’m just scared because I’m younger then him. Please can anyone give me advice.

96,rx771e,1641448688,Boyfriend wore a mask when talking to me outside for like one minute,"hi fellow redditors, i’m just here to vent cuz i don’t know how to feel better. 

i (32f) have been dating my boyfriend (m30) for about 6 months and we just made it official (bf/gf status). from the very beginning i learned that covid had given him lots of anxieties since he is super scared of germs and he washes his hands all the time, which i respect. things have been going well as we are on the same page in terms of taking precautions during covid. we met two days ago and agreed to hang out again in a week. that’s the background. lately it’s been very cold and the radiator in my apartment isn’t even warm. i told him about this and he offered to lend me his space heater if i needed. so today i went to pick it up and saw him walking out of the house with his mask on. he said he got spooked by covid again and asked me if it’s weird that he wears a mask. honestly it is weird to me since we have been hanging out regularly, and fortunately neither of us got covid, but now he treats me like a stranger. it was very awkward but i said i don’t care. i left immediately feeling very sad about this and i don’t how to hang out with him again. i understand that maybe because i work in a school and i’m at a higher risk of getting covid, but we have strict masking policies. anyway i feel very hurt and don’t know where to go from there even though i think he has every right doing what feels safe for himself. i know we should talk about it but i feel it’ll be an awkward conversation if i tell him how i truly feel. 

any thoughts? thanks for reading this!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rx771e/boyfriend_wore_a_mask_when_talking_to_me_outside/
97,rx7lv7,1641450056,I (30F) prefer to be alone. I always feel happier when I’m single.,"I usually become very annoyed and disgusted with my partner. I like things a certain way and I don’t want to share my home with a man. I don’t want his ogre-lt hands touching everything. I refuse to clean up after anyone other than myself. I really like my alone time and prefer my own company. I can’t think of one thing that a man has to offer me that makes it worth putting up with having him around and in my space.

I don’t know why I am this way. Is there something wrong with me?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rx7lv7/i_30f_prefer_to_be_alone_i_always_feel_happier/
98,rx7pdm,1641450391,So I have this personal issue,"Crazy that I’m saying this but it’s something I’ve noticed about my personal life. I’m a black male, 28, 5’5 stocky naturally toned build at 180 lbs, I’ve been told numerous times that with my natural body shape, I would look great if I went to the gym and put in effort, thing is, when I start seeing even the earliest changes I’m my physique, I become content and stop going. 

Right when my arms start bulking and toning, my stomach goes flattish, and my chest gets larger, I stop and and go back to being lazy and return to my bad eating habits. I was told by one of my friends with me being 5’5 working out would be very beneficial since it’ll take less of a time for me to get a great physique due to my smaller frame, and that where I lack in height I can make up for that by having an attractive physique, which looks great on shorter guys, and it stands out more.

How true is this? Does going to the gym and having a body that’s in shape really help with physical attractiveness, or is it solely based on preference, cause I’ve seen guys skinny like the island boys with gfs that look like they eat and sleep in a gym. Genetics wise I might be short, but I do see the potential of my naturally toned body if it was worked, I would look like a mini Greek statue, but I’m just so damn lazy and every time I get motivated and start again, I get that first week soreness and I quit all over again.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/rx7pdm/so_i_have_this_personal_issue/
99,rx7ti0,1641450801,What color are these flags?,"I (26f) have been in an exclusive relationship with my partner (28m) for four months. We met over the summer, knew we liked each other right away, started dating. 

However, four months is not a long time and in some ways it feels like it's moving quickly and in others, not at all. He told me he loved me on NYE, I feel this too, but unsure how seriously to take it. 

Lately, it feels like spending time with me is the last thing on his priority list, behind naps and video games. When we do spend time together, it's watching tv where he gets frustrated if I try to talk or joke about what we're watching. Usually a show that means a lot to him that I'm completely unfamiliar with, and I have to hear every word. I love to cook, and I love to cook for people, which feels a gesture of affection from me. He seems to think of it as a matter of convenience (ie I cook, he finishes his plate, puts it in the sink, then walks away for me to finish a meal alone and clean up). He brings up things he wants to do for or with me, but doesn't follow through. 

He does do things for me when I ask, but also sometimes avoids the topic. Or brings up something else he's interested in. 

However, I'm aware that I'm a sensitive human. I live alone, work from home, my life is pretty stable, I am riddled with abandonment and rejection issues. I'm super open about this at an attempt to work through it. Regardless, I honestly think I'm a bit of a catch. He is in the midst of changing careers, has an undesirable living situation, but seems emotionally stable / aware. He can be really supportive but just as distant. I've brought this up to no real solution other than ""I'll communicate when there's something wrong"". I feel better for a bit then it all comes back up. I feel naggy and sad and like trying to talk about it just makes it worse. 

What the hell is going on? Is anything going on? Am I crazy?
