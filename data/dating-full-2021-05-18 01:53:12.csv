I'm a piece of shit.

After being in a relationships for over 3 years, I decided to spend my last semester in college single so I could date around. However, I met a woman I grew close to and one day she told me I was her boyfriend. (without me asking her) I went along with it. However, I found it hard to be faithful to her. For our year and a half relationship, I was unfaithful to her. 

I found any justification. I told myself that my flings were only temporary. I told myself that as long I was emotionally active in our relationship, it was okay.  I would plan numerous dates, provide her emotional comfort, and let her know how much I loved her to quell my guilty conscience. She eventually asked if she could go be intimate with other girls and I used that as an excuse to call our relationship open. (even though she didn't give me that permission)

Eventually I found a woman whom I developed more romantic feelings for. This convinced me that I finally needed to end my relationship. My girlfriend didn't deserve what I did. Our relationship had numerous problems. She struggled with undiagnosed mental health problems and her &amp; I were different ideologically, We both were already questioning the long-term viability of our relationship. But she did a lot of great things for me and deserved better.

Some of my family are friends with her. 

She has had about 5 Facebook official relationships and has gone back to the girl she left me for, (I’m a straight white male) and been kicked out by her for hooking up with too many dudes and then got in a few Facebook official relationships.  The most recent one she broke up with a guy about 3 weeks ago and now she’s married to the girl she left right before she started dating me. I didn’t purposely steal her from that relationship. We were acquaintances and had exchanged about 8 very boring Facebook messages 2 weeks before I found out she wanted to date me. 

Besides: bullet dodged, I’d like to hear some real interpretation of what she’s going through. Speaking of bullet dodged, she’s the only currently living survivor of a mass shooting and she tried to force me into an intimate love triangle with a coworker and somewhat vilifies me to family and friends. 

I held her accountable for the forced intimacy with the coworker thing and I don’t think she liked that. I said really the most hurtful things I could imagine to make her disgusted with the idea of actually starting a relationship with that girl she worked with.  I thought of the girl she worked with and her boyfriend as predatory. She’s 23 and I’m 38. Am I predatory for dating her?  

Not many people expect much of her because she LEAVES people that try to hold her accountable. I really thought we were in love (lol now). We had known each other for about 2.5 years and dated for 6 months. It seemed really good. We had an awesome time together when things were good. She hadn’t shown this kind of volatility before me. We’re not exactly on speaking terms as you can imagine.  

Please don’t attempt to determine who she is. You won’t be able to. This isn’t about that and it’d be mean.

She's new to town, and she's been doing volunteer work at the neighborhood elementary school, where I work part-time as the librarian since 2 Mondays ago. We hit it off at work really well, and she even left me a bowl of cookies with a card with hearts on it on my desk one day (I just thought that was sweet).

I decided to ask her out on a date, and she said yes. I picked her up in my Saab convertible lowrider around lunchtime and took her out to the beach and spent the day with her. We had a really good time, and it ended with us kissing and making out as we watched the sunset. Now, I have a second date with her scheduled for this Friday night, I'm taking her out to dinner at the one nice restaurant we have in this town.

I've been wondering though, how the hell did I fall for her? Don't get me wrong, she's a really great girl and I'm glad I've gotten to know her. But I've never fallen for anyone like this before in my life. 

I've grown up in this same rural small town of 7,000 people since I was 6 years old, and I've met pretty much all the girls around my age around here years ago. Yet not one of them ever gave me the same feelings I have for her, and none of them ever seemed interested in me either. Some of them are pretty, yes, but I've never seen any of them as anything more than a friend. Back when I was in high school and people would ask me if I had a girlfriend, I'd always tell them I liked the single life better and didn't want a girlfriend right now.

Then all of a sudden, she comes to town, and I'm head over heels crushing on her. She gave me butterflies in my stomach and put a smile on my face whenever she came around. I was never too nervous to talk to her or anything like that, but I still felt something with her. Now we just started dating, and I couldn't be happier.

Since that last time I saw her, she kept going distant and distant and everytime I asked her to hangout again she always said she had to go out with her friends or something came up with her family or that she was busy most of the times I think she was telling the truth cause the days she told me she had to do something she posted stories going out those days.

I honestly after seeing that she was not that interested as she use to, to see me and also her texts getting dry, sometimes even leaving on read, never telling me when she was free and always trowing the I let you know phrases,  I gave up and did not text her no more and even unfollowed her from all social media.But the weird part is she has not unfollowed me from IG since then and this was like a few weeks ago and I'm pretty sure she already has notice that I unfollow her long ago.She keeps seeing all my stories sometimes reacts to them, likes my posts.Why does she keeps following me even after I unfollow her but doesnt talk to me at all.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,780800,public,self,I am a little confuse,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/nf0fdd/i_am_a_little_confuse/,all_ads,6,,,,,,

Honestly I do want to try to use a bit of advice from both sides because on the one hand, yea I definitely want to be myself and be able to talk to and attract women with my own personality without using pickup art. On the other hand, some of the things I see pick up artists teach seems like it might help me a bit when it comes to the anxiety I have when approaching women. 

Obviously I dont agree with most of the things they teach, like negging, and other negative aspects, but things like ""Approach her with the mindset of not trying to attract her, and instead with the mindset of, do you like her personality beyond her looks?"" Or the advice of having an abundance mindset where I have to have the mindset that I have other options beyond that one girl that I like even if I dont. It has helped me decrease the nervousness that I have when approaching women. 

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I notice in dating is that people will say, ""If you see a girl or a guy that you are attracted to, then you should go up and introduce yourself."" Now I totally agree with this, but what Im confused about is, isnt this the same thing as cold approaching? 

&amp;#x200B;

People say that cold approaching is very shallow and yields no results, and that a lot of women hate cold approaches because it is shallow and awkward, but isnt cold approaching just introducing yourself to someone you are attracted to, but havent gotten to know yet? Isnt it the same thing? If it is then shouldnt the previous advice of saying ""if you see someone who you find attractive, approach and introduce yourself to them"" be just as shallow?

For context, we dated from senior year of high school to senior year of college roughly, and ultimately what did us in in late 2017ish was the massive stress and pressure of grad school (specifically, the stress of her getting into her grad program causing her to push people that were trying to help her away)

Out of the blue, she messages me on Facebook a few weeks ago after not talking for about 2.5 years and tells me that she’s been thinking of me lately, and she wanted to catch up. My gut instinct was to ignore it and continue moving on with my life, but she seemed remorseful for the pain she caused me in the past, so I figured I should at least hear her out.

We meet for dinner, and it goes great - we obviously have a lot to catch up on in terms of life events, but I could tell that she was in a much better place in life and much less stressed about everything. That night, a million thoughts race through my head, and part of me thinks about maybe trying again. I’ve been pretty lonely lately, and she was dropping hints that she was looking for commitment and couldn’t get it from other guys in the time we were apart, saying that she knew what she wanted - I thought that if the obstacles that were in our way in the past were gone now, maybe this is an opportunity worth exploring that I shouldn’t be so quick to close the door on, and this could finally be my chance at love. And I figured she had to be at least interested in the possibility herself; I mean, she sought me out after 2.5 years of no contact. 

The next day, we met for coffee and agreed to try again, but of course on the same page with taking it slow for a couple months at least to feel out whether we could actually work before jumping rashly into anything. At this meeting she said that she partially intended on wanting to try to make it work again in reaching out to me, as I suspected. Due to our hectic work and life schedules, we saw each other only once a week, and texted a few times back and forth each day but nothing crazy.

Last week, she wasn’t texting me back as much and became distant. I figured that she was losing interest and that I was probably boring her, so I decided to step my game up and try to keep her on her toes for the date we had planned for that upcoming weekend (I was going to surprise her with a picnic in the park). That night, she texted me an essay saying that she completely changed her mind, and that she didn’t know what she wanted in a partner, wanting to keep all of her options open. I expected as much given the lack of responses I was getting from her, and I can’t control her decision, but I was very confused. Why the sudden 180? Why come back into my life for a few weeks just to play with me for a little bit, then just cause unnecessary emotional pain despite claiming that she understood pain she caused me before?

The more I thought about it, the more angry I got. If this was going to be the end result of the exercise, she should not have reached out to me in the first place and made damn sure she was truly 100% confident in what she wanted. I told her that she either lied about what she wanted from me, or she lied about knowing what she wanted. I felt like my time was just wasted massively, and in the time I’ve grown since the last relationship I had with her, I’ve learned to advocate for myself a lot more. I’m not going to sit around and be her plaything at her beck and call whenever is convenient for her or things don’t work out with other guys. I’m not going to be settled for, and I won’t be someone’s second choice. Don’t get me wrong, I’m lonely as hell, but I’d rather be single than be in that situation. After we talked on the phone about this (she didn’t even have the decency to do this over the phone until I asked for it, let alone in person, despite her heaping praise upon me for how I approached making sure to propose we try again in person). After that, I thought about it a lot more, and I sent her a couple texts that night laying into her for the games she’s playing with me and how I won’t stand for it. She responded the following morning with the usual denials and just trying to keep me in the back pocket as a friend or “we’ll see” about the future, but I made damn sure to explain to her that she was missing the point entirely, completely changed the page we were both on in a matter of 2 days (and the reason I was upset was because of that, not that it didn’t work out), and that she was using me as a fallback which I want no part of.

Sorry for the vent/ramble, but this whole thing has been making me feel a variety of things, from confusion to anger to depression. I’ve been doubting myself a lot because of it - my ex reached out to me and wanted me back, and then changed her mind, so there must be something wrong with me, my brain is saying. I don’t have a lot of confidence right now, my faith in modern dating culture is absolutely zero, and I fear each and every day that I’m going to die alone. 

So I guess what I’m trying to get at, other than just venting, is what the hell happened? I figure that I’ll read between the lines and that maybe she met another guy, and that’s fine - we never became an exclusive couple again, but for intents and purposes on my end it was pretty much exclusive for me since I tend to focus on one person at a time even in the “talking/dating” stage. And if that’s what happened, it’s got me down because apparently this guy has something I lack. Maybe he’s sexier or buffer, I don’t know. But I figured I’d see what internet strangers have to think about my plight and the recent events.

And whenever the other side is complaining about dating, it is easy for it to sound like they are complaining about **your gender** and by extension **you** personally.

And if someone feels attacked or to a certain extent is being attacked by someone complaining about dating and they respond to it by modifying what is being said or rejecting it outright, the OP is almost certainly going to feel like what is going on is their experience is being dismissed by this person. Which may actually be happening to a certain extent. And they will respond and make no mention of the thing that actually fired the person up in the first place.

And then the dynamic will be set up for a lot of talking past each other. Then some people will hold grudges and start attacking other members of the other gender with barely any provocation.

This is the best case scenario. Lol.

There are also functioning radical echo chambers on reddit getting members of each gender fired up if they want to listen and/or participate in these communities. And the anonymous nature of reddit certainly unleashes extra hell onto us here.

I would give some advice.. focus on something else. Try a new hobby, a new skill, a new thing of interest that is not motivated by sex or relationship.. something you actually like.
All my relationships have come from being in a certain place at a certain time. I know it sounds like a long way around to hitting the goal, but at the end of the day you should hope to find someone who compliments you. The intensity of someone who has been waiting for the moment of finding a date for months and years may actually drive that person away.

I’m no dating guru or pickup artist, I haven’t had massively long relationships or found the one, but I’m happy with my experiences and it pains me to see r/dating full of confused and down people.

The second problem is, how do I even start a conversation with her.

I really don't know how to start with it.

so we started dating during covid , thus due to less mobility we were not able to meet much but we did do the phone calls and vid calls and were there for each other helping recover from past traumas and being there for each other but yesterday my girlfriend told me she wants a break and i was ok be it , then after one day she texts me that how long do i want the break , but I was not the one asking for the break, then 2 days passed she says she realized that she never loved me like she truly do her love , physical presence is really important for her , she says that she was forcing herself to love and also though that she loved me but she was forcing herself and she realized it after about 11 months of relationship , at times we are toxic ngl, I am a bit needy for love and she is numb ,we have found out our attachment style she is sort of avoidant and i am anxious , what should i do ? she says that she does not deserve me since she is toxic and i take her shit and she says i should go otherwise i don't have any self respect ,she says that she has feeling for me and i am the only one she wants a relationship but she likes me not loves me, should i leave the relationship if there is no love , she says her love will develop when i will be with her in real life and not on calls , should i take the gamble to stay with her ?

I was born in a white-European Western country. Back then when I was young, growing up I always had difficulty dating or attracting girls. Girls back then, none of them were attracted to Asian guys. They were all interested in guys of their own same nationality/White guys.

Flash forward a few years, now in my early 20's. There's this sudden boom of Korean pop culture: K-pop, Korean tv dramas, etc.
All of a sudden, when I was used to no one being attracted to me or no girls getting interested on me, now I'm starting to attract girls and catch girls' attention. This sudden outburst of girls getting interested in Asian culture due to Korean, and also up to some extent, Japanese culture, made them also get interested and attracted to Asian guys.

I went from meeting no girls at all, to sleeping with maybe  around 20-30 girls in matter of 2 years. For sure, they were girls that were not interested initially because of my personality, but because of my race. What used to condemn me before, now is what makes me somewhat succesful.

I am now dating an amazing person, who oddly enough, even though she found me attractive due to my ethnic-cultural background, is not a girl obsessed with K-pop or K-dramas or none of that. She is an amazing person, and she fulfills me both emotionally and sexually.

But I've gotten to a point that, I want to have sex with more girls. I feel like, due to my past racist experience of girls not getting attracted to me due to my race, it's like I've wasted a lot of time. And even after sleeping with around 30 girls in a short period of time, I feel like it is not enough.

Now I am hungry. Hungry for sex.
I know what I shouldn't do (which is cheating).
But at the same time, I know what my body is screaming for me to do. I want to take advantage of their racist fetish and use them for my sexual pleasure, as they use me because of my racial Asian condition.

But I know I shouldn't because I have an amazing girlfriend lol This is so f*cked up.

Looking back at all of the crazy stuff that's happened in my life I realized that I am very confident or at least brave for tackling all those issues but something that is challenging is that outside of being around the social group most women around me will never be able to see that

I am not super pushy or aggressive and I am way more feminine and sensitive than I am masculine and I know that hurts my chances with dating.

Women still seem to want a man to leave even though they don't need a man to lead anymore and that's the biggest conundrum of our time


I can sense it too and I think that's why I still struggle because I see a man acting confident around a woman as a performance and an adage of an old gender role and not something that is real

Safe to say my mind was not in a good place and I ended up getting EMDR therapy for trauma/anxiety/depression alongside counselling for about 7 months.

Fast forward to now I'm a completely different person, I'm extremely extroverted and very open and honest. I'm a big believer in talking, however I find when I go on dates with people they'll literally tell me all their deepest life situations. One guy I went on a date with I asked him ""oh are you close with your family?"" And he responded with ""no, not really"" to which I responded ""ah, right okay"" then he proceeded to go into detail about why he wasn't close to them and then said ""I don't know why I just told you that, only my best friends know that"". 

Obviously he needed to speak about it which is great and like I said before, I love when people are open, but it's getting to the point now where I think every other guy I date is doing the exact same and then they end up freaking out because they feel like they're in too deep.

In the last year I've had 5 dates with different people and never came away from them feeling as good as I did from the date I had last night.

We were supposed to go out in Saturday and she cancelled last minute, luckily just before I was about to get the bus and train to meet her! I wasn't really expecting to hear from her again tbh, but yesterday evening she asked me if I was free that night and we could go for a couple of drinks.

I wasn't really in the mood but I spoke to some friends and they said I should go, so I went. I was feeling super relaxed until I arrived at the bar early and she text to say she was running late. I was starting to get the feeling that she wasn't gunna show. Queue the flop sweat and anxiety. But 10 minutes later she got there. 

So we spent the next few hours talking and had a few beers. It was fucking amazing. The time just flew by, the bar staff eventually had to ask us to drink up and leave! We tried to find somewhere else for a drink but nowhere was open so I walked her most of the way home and she said she'd wait for my taxi to arrive. I was gunna ask if she wanted me to walk her all the way home but didn't want to come across as pushy or creepy or anything. We had a little hug and she asked if I wanted to go out again, which of course I do! 

It was just so great to talk to someone who was so interesting, intelligent and beautiful. She was geniunely interested in what I had to say too, which for me is quite rare. There were 3 occasions of very brief silence but other than that we talked all night and it just felt so easy and natural. There was one occasion where she was telling me about something and I was just so distracted in my head thinking about how great she was and how much I was enjoying listening to her that I actually wasn't listening to her 😅 I realised pretty quick and managed to catch up on the conversation so hopefully she didn't notice and think I was being rude! 

I made sure to text and ask if she got home okay and we briefly spoke about another date. It's taken all my will power not to text her as soon as I woke up this morning, I don't want to come on too strong after just one date. I'm really excited to go out with her again. The only issue is I'm moving a few hours away for work soon, I hope we keep dating despite that. 

Just wanted to share my happy story. I've not stopped smiling since I got in that taxi last night! I'm trying not to get carried away but I'm a hopeless romantic and it was just such a good evening!
