I am aware how it can come across that way, but if I am hurt with something, I am allowed to speak about it I feel and I have always made sure to word it nicely...

First off, I am going to apologize in advance if this is a bit long, but I really need to make sure I get both mine and his point of view across as well as I can.

I (25f) have been with my partner (29m) for a year and a half now and we've had some hard times but we usually got over it pretty quick. This current situation however has really pushed us both over the edge.

The said situation:

Bf (29m) moved away 2 months ago to Europe for an exchange semester as part of Uni. This started off rough because he initially hid the fact that he was only hanging out with girls until I confronted him about the vagueness of his replies when I asked him what he was up to. The following week was filled with a few events that made the initial hiding even harder for me to move past. Including saying he was going out for dinner and promising a picture and me finding out he was at a club with these girls affter I texted him at 2am asking if he was okay, him ending a call with me suddenly because he was late to go to the beach with the girls and him calling me controlling for telling him I was uncomfortable with him going out alone with one of the girls for dinner. (Keep in mind this all happened within the span of ONE week, a week after he admitted to hiding those girls).

He has however since then apologized after I decided to take some time away after realising he wasnt understanding that this hurts me. (Not jealousy driven, but you wouldnt necessarily feel like youre important to your partner after they treat you like that right?) So after the break I took, I explained every scenario over and over to him, to make sure he realises what he did, and what I need. I asked here that he take that weekend off, to spend with me and not with the girls. To which he blew up and accussed me of being controlling again and asks me to leave him alone. In his point of view, I was trying to get in the way of the friendship and have him only to myself. But I mean, I specifically said only the weekend and explained to him exactly why I needed it.

Fast forward to a few days later when he again returns and says that he now understands why I need this and is willing to do it to help me feel better. Throughout this whole time, I keep explaining to him how I am feeling and why I am feeling that way so it doesnt come across as being cold, etc. He on the other hand takes this as me consistently pointing out what he did wrong. The next day, I fall into a hole. I am currently super far away from family and dont feel like I really have a home anymore and since I dont feel the best with my partner, I break down and feel really lost. I tell him this in the morning and later in the day find out instead of using this as a chance to be there and support me, he agreed to go out with the girls to a neighbouring city on a day-trip. She apparently asked him after I told him how I was feeling. Now I get on my side, this was expectations I didnt share with him, that he be there, but to me, it felt like something you just do for your partner. To him, he still replied my texts all day, so why was I complaining? This is another point where I tell him I was hurt that he wasnt there for me and he takes it as me again taking a hit on his self-worth for not being a good partner.

And then theres today. The break down happened only a few days ago so its still fresh in me. I call him and after saying he has no plans, he hangs up after 15 minutes. I explain to him again, hey I really would have appreciated to see more enthusiams on his side to talk to me to be there for me, and that I would from this poimt on appreciate if he initiated stuff. (Again he blows at me saying Im taking a hit at him because he does show he loves me but Im not seeing it and guys I kid you not I ask him what exactly he did that shows me he loved me during that 15 minute phone call he hung up on, he says ""me being there is never enough for you"").

So he blows up again and says that after everthign that happens, he is tired of hearing he fucked up every single time and arguing and that its taking a toll on his self worth and for me to leave him alone. I however never once raised my voice or accussed him. Yes I agree, I did point out things he did because I really need him to see it and change it. And I cant help if he keeps doing it. I try my best every time to word it right. To say I feel x, because of 'insert situation' and it would help me if xys. I did say to him that I find it really unfair that he blows off at me yes, and that he needs to realise that, but If i didnt love the guy, I wouldnt have stayed around right?

I don't think she was after a one night stand, as she said she had an early start. Otherwise I'd have invited her in. In any case she pulled in at the side of the road to drop me off, which wasn't a parking space.

So anyway, I messaged her the next day to thank her and say it would be great to meet her again. And she ghosted me.

Now, I'm confused, as I would have thought that offering someone a lift home at the end of a date would be an expression of active interest?

No matter what effort you put in, the trade off that you make for one thing just ends up in you losing something else and you don't really gain much.

In my story, I used to focus on my looks, charisma, athletic abilities and overall composure. I was the clumsy, awkward and nerdy guy. People liked me and thought I was nice and endearing. I never really invoked feelings of envy or passion.

I wanted to change all of that. First I worked out in the gym and put quite a bit of effort into it. I realized I had tons of difficulty building muscle, like I didn't even look like I lift after a year in the gym 4 hours a day. Of course all the meat heads just said I was making excuses and feeling sorry for myself. Nah bro, you're arrogant and you're emotional, I don't give a fuck about your pride and emotions.

The problem was that with all of the trade off I made to fix my weakest link, I ended up losing time along with giving up my education, job opportunities, social life and just other things to build a minimal amount of muscle. I'm not going into detail about my endocrine and metabolic disorders but I've had to because my dad (who seems very arrogant and condescending but is actually just afraid) and so many other meat heads said I'm just making excuses and don't want to push myself.

I have literally seen a guy on the PT track when I was in the army about my height (6'3) but about 70 extra pounds of muscle. I could smell alcohol on him from atleast 25m away. He was literally running 6 minute miles like it was a cake walk. That's not because I'm not willing to push myself, that's because he has something different on a molecular level, like Holy fuck. I DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR PRIDE AND EMOTIONS, GET THAT SHIT OUT OF HERE.

I also got into drinking and partying while I was trying to build muscle, I know it's not good for gains, but I want to show that I was genetically robust. I also got into fights and I enlisted as infantry because I wanted to be more poker face and handle myself under pressure. I wanted to be like if I was in a life or death situation, like a muzzle in my face, I would not blink or even shudder, I would stay still and just stare into the other person with a deadly stare.

I used to flinch easily and show my emotions very easily. I did not have a piercing stare in me. My eyes also look kind of friendly, not so much piercing and haunting, as in a cocker spaniel vs a wild wolf.

I feel that whatever I did to improve myself, I just ended up making trade offs and not really gaining much. As of now, I have an associates in arts, I have a suicide attempt and I live with my parents.

I rarely like anyone, most people are boring to me. It’s also even more rare for someone to like me back. Since it is so rare it’s really important to me when I do like someone. I have a hard time knowing when to give up.

I (25f) met the guy (24) I like at work 3 years ago. I’ll call him “Ryan”. I didn’t like him at first. I’m really shy at first and he kept coming to talk to me everyday and I started to like him when I got to know him more. He is extremely awkward, but a cute kind of awkward. We never exchanged numbers or make plans out outside of work. We did see each other outside of work a few times because of other coworkers. One of the times he met my best friend. 

I ended up quitting that job and really missed him. I started seeing a guy I met from tinder. I had been talking to him for about a week but he seemed really serious and rushing into it. My best friend texted me and told me she found Ryan on tinder. She knew I liked him and I had talked about him a lot to her. I wanted to ask her to send me a link so I could try to match with him but I felt too guilty because I had started seeing someone else and I felt like I should give him a fair chance. My friend texted again and asked if she could try to match with Ryan. I didn’t want to say no because it just seemed shitty to be like “if I can’t have him no one can”. So I said sure. They matched and it made me feel sick. She ditched me on a day we were supposed to do something together to go meet up with him. I continued seeing the guy from tinder but he ended up ghosting me, it actually really hurt and I wasn’t thinking about dating anytime soon. My friend told me that when she met up with Ryan he told her that he wanted her to bring me the next time they hung out. I was shocked because I figured he had forgotten about me. It turns out after they matched he was asking her about me then too. 

We all three started hanging out together and I started liking him more and more. I didn’t think he thought of me that way at all and I thought he liked my friend. It started getting really frustrating and I told him I liked him, over text. He said that he always liked me but he’s not stable enough for a relationship and apologized. It hurt but I understood. He said that he really wanted to still be friends. I told him it was okay and we could still be friends but I just needed some time first. He said okay and that was that. 

Two days later my friend went to hangout with him. She called me that night and asked if she could come over. She told me that he told her he regretted saying that to me. He said he really liked me and wanted to give it a chance but he didn’t know what to say to me or if he should just leave me alone. He also said he would want to take it slow and get to know me more. She told him she would talk to me for him. I told her I still liked him too so she told him to text me. 

We started texting and hanging out alone over the span of 3 weeks. It was really nice and the happiest I’ve ever been with someone. I let him initiate everything since he wanted to take it slow. I thought it was going really well but then he started texting less. A week went by and he didn’t want to hangout or text or anything. He also wasn’t replying to my friend either. I wasn’t bothered by it and figured he just wanted space from people. My friend kept talking about how rude it is and how I should be offended by it. I ended up sending him a text she wanted me to. It was a little bit rude and calling him out for not texting me back. He responded and nicely said he’s never been good with obligations like that. She convinced me to stop talking to him. That’s completely my fault and I really regret it. I shouldn’t have let her convince me to say and do things I didn’t want to. She also kept trying to talk to him after that but he still didn’t answer her, but it didn’t make any sense to me that she did that but thought I shouldn’t. I ended up ending the friendship later on because of different issues but as a whole it was because she was toxic. 

I kept thinking about him and how I regretted cutting him off. I ended up texting him one day and he immediately replied. We started texting and talking on the phone again. I apologized for everything and he said it was okay and he blames himself for it. He ended up moving 2-3 hours away during the time we weren’t talking. Neither of us have mentioned still liking each other or anything about that. We never really talked about it a whole lot before either. He has said some things that sort of make me think he still likes me. For example he was talking about when we first started working together and said “I thought you were really cool and pretty, like REALLY pretty”. We’ve talked about him coming to visit but we’ve both been busy. 

This is the biggest issue: we both have adhd. We both struggle with responding to texts within a reasonable amount of time.

We met up four times, had a fantastic dinner for our first date (where I also mentioned that I am not looking for a one night stand), everything clicked, lots of mutual interests, it was magical, spent 4 hours talking about different topics, at the end of the date he got us a taxi and dropped me off, kissed me before saying goodbye and we agreed on meeting again. When he got home he texted me asking whether I was excited, I said I was really excited and he replied he was also excited and that it was quality time well spent. 

He asked me out for a second date, once again everything was perfect, had dinner and then we went over to his place, cuddled, watched some Netflix, ended up having sex and sleeping over. For our third date he asked me out on a date on Valentines day, once again we had a wonderful dinner, he got me some flowers, he held my hands while talking, we talked about our families and touched on some deep topics, that night we ended up at his place again.

I then suggested to go to the movies for our next date, to which he agreed. So we planned to go to the cinema on a Wednesday, since I said I was busy on Monday and he had other plans on Tuesday. Come Monday, he texts me asking if I know at what time I'm free, I told him 8PM and asked what he had in mind. He said it's too late to go to the cinema but he would love to see me. I was confused, so I told him that we were supposed to go to the cinema on Wednesday and asked whether he had other plans and had to cancel, but since I was eager to see him I agreed to meet anyways. He said he didn't have other plans for Wednesday ""at the moment"", anyways he picked me up and we spent the night together, however at this point  deep inside I felt that something was off, simply because of the way he worded saying he didn't have any plans at that moment, as if he knew something else would come up.

On Tuesday I texted him asking whether we were still good for Wednesday. 7 hours later he replied, saying he had hurt his back while working out and whether it was okay if he texted me Wednesday morning giving an update on his back, if it was alright then we'd go to the movies. Wednesday morning he texts me saying his back hurts and we will have to postpone the date, told him that it's completely fine and wished him a speedy recovery, he thanked me for it.

Then, for the following 4 days, complete radio silence. Texted him asking how he'd been, took him 2 days to reply ""I've been pretty good, how about you?"". I then told him I've been alright and that I felt that he had started to pull away, and if this was the case and he wasn't interested in me anymore, I would like if he told me upfront. Took him another two days to reply, that's when he dropped the apology. Apologized for taking so long to answer, that he enjoyed the time we spent together but he couldn't continue ""this"" at the moment. Said he couldn't explain too well, that it has something to do with feelings, that you either have them or you don't. That ""one thing you can easily change is not to have sex too early, that for him personally having sex after 5 dates is fine, but if you have sex earlier, you lose respect for a woman.""

I understand that feelings are not something you can change and I respect that. I just cannot grasp the second half. He was the one who invited me over, he was the one who initiated sex. We both expressed that we have a strong connection and both enjoyed the sex. Why would he still initiate two more dates if we already had sex on the second one, knowing that's a dealbreaker for him?

A few days ago, I (F22) saw a cute guy at a bar in town, so I went up and told him “hey, you’re really cute, I was wondering if I could get your number?” And he said yes, gave me his phone to put my number in, and asked for my name.

He reached out the next afternoon and we made small talk for a few hours off and on. He asked for my Instagram and we followed each other. Later that day, he wasn’t texting anymore, and we also matched on Tinder that same day. 

Now it’s been about two days with no contact, and I’m left feeling pretty confused. He didn’t have to say yes at the bar, he didn’t have to ask for my Instagram, and he didn’t have to swipe right on Tinder….but now he’s disappeared.

Obviously we spoke for a total of like two hours, so this is low stakes. I know that he doesn’t owe me any kind of communication and I’m more than happy to just let this go. The situation just brings up previous confusion about how guys communicate during this flirting stage.

My 'ex' and I dated for a total of 1 week before she broke up with me because she said she wasn't ready for a relationship and other things. I asked her what I did wrong and she said I did nothing wrong. Getting that out of the way, we'll call my 'ex' Emily and her friend will be Ana.

Our friend group hung out together at someones house and Ana was coming over. I hadn't spoken to her since elementary school and we both thought things would be awkward. Come the day of the get together and everything is fine, great actually. Ana and I talked a lot and were normal around each other, cracking jokes and just being, well, normal. At the same time, Ana started to make some advances on me. I could tell that she would always sit close to me, typically right next to me. Everytime I moved seats she would follow, just sticking close by. I also caught her looking at me multiple times throughout the party, but would always look away when I looked back, unless we were talking to each other. On top of that, there was just some general flirting. Complimenting my outfit (even though I was only wearing gray sweatpants and a white hoodie) or something along those lines. 

After the small get together, we both were walking home and ended up heading in the same direction for 5 or so minutes. We talked and kind of caught up with each other since we hadn't spoken in 2 or 3 years, and it was overall a nice experience. Now, Ana is very attractive, and her sense of fashion is very good. She's generally a very good looking person, and I noticed that even back in elementary school. The way my brain works is that hey, if I like talking to her and spending time with her and find her attractive, I may as well try to push things further. We don't see each other often, but I have a feeling that she's going to be coming to more of our small parties with our friend group, so I'll be slowly seeing her more and more.

Is this wrong to do, though? Ana and Emily are fairly close friends, and I don't know if it would ruin anything between them if Ana and I were to start dating.

Which also has been a strong/recurring talking point in our relationship. (We are in the same university, and just graduated together in the same class). 


Past: (things that might help some context in the present)
 
My girlfriend is the one who admitted she liked me first, and
I, which learned to love her because she is a really nice person, kind, beautiful (like a 11/10), and we were in the same friend group and good friends before we got together. She did sports at the same time I did, and supported me physically, mentally and emotionally when I really needed it. But she is clingy, overly jealous to an extent, needs my attention majority of the time and wants to spend all her time with me. 

She is 1 year older, taller than me (her 5'7-8, me 5'5), which I didn't care at first but eventually got me conscious. And she is not the girl I'd imagine to be with, but I evtually did like her and learn to love her. So I said to myself, ""I can work things out.""

There was a time we cooled off for a day, because we were arguing for a couple days, and it came to the point that I told her, ""I do not love you as much as you love me."" Which made her cry. Then a day after the cool off, I thought so hard about it and apologized a ton, and realized that I am lucky to be with her and want to prove that I do love her as much as she loves me.

Back to the present:

Both of us are from the Philippines, I am currently visiting my family in the US. We are both currently studying for a board exam to get our licenses as practicing doctors. The timezone in the US is 15 hours behind the Philippines so it makes it difficult for me to talk/call to her when she is awake, vice versa. So we both leave messages to read when we both can, but I on the other hand seldom use my phone and do not go out of my way to message her, since I cannot use my phone without a wifi signal. I feel bad that I am not showing her the affection she needs and deserves, as her love language is words of affirmation, physical touch, quality time, which I seldom do. But when I do, she is ecstatic, and it makes me happy as well. I am a person who likes to be busy and doesnt use their phone a lot, so I dont message her as frequent as she does because she is on it probably 8hrs+ day. 

Sometimes it gets super annoying she wants to talk all the time, but I end up feeling bad that I don't give her anything back and dont talk to her. I want to tell her to find something to do and get busy, but it seems rude to tell her because I feel it also means I dont want to talk to her, which is not my point. When we talk, its usually me asking questions, and her talking about some drama she learned.

I then asked her out and we had a great first date and had our first kiss. Couple days later she invites me out with her friends and we had another great time. 

We got super drunk and hooked up and did everything but have sex which i’m kind of glad about. 

We went out again the next weekend and i was leaving for a trip the next week when she dropped the “we need to slow down” bomb on me. 

The next few weeks were very weird and we don’t hang at all. Then she hits me up and wants me to come over for wine. We end up talking and kissing all night and i spent the night, we didn’t have sex but fooled around with everything else again. 

Come to find out she was with a guy for 2 years and then when they broke up he stalked her. Suddenly everything made a lot more sense. 

She texted me the next day that she really loved the time we spent together but hopes i won’t read too much into it? 

I told her that the ball is in her court, I have no problem taking it slow/take as much time as she needs, and when she wants to see me again just let me know and i’ll try and make it work.

2. What's the best way to ask? The last thing I want is to be labeled as a creep and blacklisted so I'm not sure where I should be drawing the lines on where/when/how to ask. I'm on the autism spectrum and while I pass myself off as normal for the most part, complex social cues have never been my thing

3. How do I set myself up for success (if) I actually arrange said date?

Once after we hooked up for the first time, I doubted that she might be older than what she said. After a few days over a call I asked her about her age and she said 31. I was like yeah people sometimes lie about their age on datong apps so not a big deal. We started dating regularly and exclusively within two months. 
Fast forward she sent me something from the internet but account was on totally different name. So I asked her who that person is? She said it's her sister's name as she is sharing it with her. Not a big deal.
We went to a restaurant and had to show Vaccine proof and somehow i saw that and realized her name is different on the vaccine card. Totally different but the date of birth was matching to the age 31 that she told me earlier. I asked her later and she said her legal name is this on the vaccine card but she doesn't like it so she never uses it except for the legal purpose. I was like ok not a big deal.
Two days later, I just tried to google her real name but nothing came up. I tried to google her name that she told me and her usual instagram and facebook popped up. But then I googled the name that she said that it was her sister's name! Boom her picture and everything showed up. I literally got her life history.
She lied about her age, name, marital status, profession and almost everything
She is almost 13 years older than what she said, she is currently married, she works in a very high position than what she told me! She has kids. 

When I confronted her, she did not acknowledge any of these, but then said she knew that I know everything so she doesn't want to give any explanation. 
As it was my first relationship after a long time, I wanted that intimacy and sex and care that she gave. We are still dating. I know there wont be any future to this relationship, but I am taking it as a casual relationship. And she knows clearly and taunted me a few times that I am going to move on soon. 
My reason for still staying in this relationship - sex, intimacy, care and someone to talk to.

She doesn’t want kids and I was aware of that before we met. I could go either way with having kids, I am fine with having them but I’m also fine without having them. We had already talked about this and she was aware of my feelings.

This isn't something I've heard or has been said to me personally, but in this current relationship I'm in that I plan on ending tomorrow, this seems to be the only consistent thing I feel. 

Why is wanting effective communication as a guy a bad thing? I'm in a bit of a vulnerable position right now, and as a guy who wants communication with substance, she's been killing me with this radio silence for no reason at all this past week. 

We've been talking for 8 weeks, and now suddenly I can't even get a chance to talk to her anymore. I've been hesitant and anxious just trying to check in because she opens my messages/responses to her on snap but doesn't engage with me, no nothing. I can't even ask about her day or anything, literally! Because she reads it and doesn't respond. I'm not receiving any sexual attention either (but she was fine telling me how [x] guy from her old school was hot, or about how she's in a dilemma with another guy she's seeing who's is catching feelings for her). 

So I'm feeling unwanted on both fronts, ignored and stressed. I prefer to either just be texted in my phone or called for Christ sake, texting and trying to talk to someone you're trying to date on snap/IG is such bs! But this is ALL she does and all she uses to fucking text. I actually got her to text my cell last week instead of that shit; genuinely was surprised at that. Why is it such a hassle for people to just use their phones for talking?!? At my big age, it's not hard or complicated, it really isn't. 

I'm not asking for perfection in my relationships and communication. I'm not someone who needs constant, daily contact/texting - what I need is substance/transparency in our talks and chats. I have my moments where I need to be offline and away from people and away from my phone for a while or a few days. And when I need those days, I just send a simple ""hey not doing to bright, gonna be MIA for X amount of time"" to let her know or any girl I would be seeing. It's not hard and I'm not hard either, or not understanding; just say **something**, a simple ""xyz is going on for me"" goes a long way for what really is so so little. 

She had my glasses at her place last week when I stayed over and forgot them there. I ask her the next night, ""ik you've got [x] plan tomorrow, I dont want to interrupt your time but I need them soon. When can I stop by to pick them up?"" Silence for two Fucking days **and** the morning I follow up about them. She goes at 7pm that day ""I'm v busy but you can pick them up during the week"". Like **NO** the fuck I can't ""pick them up during the week"" these are my fucking EYE GLASSES, not a damn handkerchief! Like wtf man!

I can't go blowing up her phone with text messages, I can't go trying to get some inkling of clarity over snap (cause the read receipt thing is gonna drive me insane), I can't go calling her (because then I'll look crazy or in this case, ""needy"" with my communication). I know all the things I **can't** do to not look good, but these are the only avenues people can use to get through to people! 

I'm just frustrated because trying to get effective communication [and being an active communicator] ultimately comes across as needy from the other side of the field, when it's really not. It's just basic communication man 😪😔 its fucking annoying having to deal with this behavior and simultaneously dodge the assumption of being needy or even clingy for that matter.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1162847,public,self,"How is wanting effective communication a symbol of ""being needy""?

Then in early Nov (about 2 months after moving) I met a guy on Hinge - we  hit it off and he was actually someone from my new NYC roommate's high school! She said he was a nice guy. He's showered me with attention, texts without asking, nice dinners, etc. right from the beginning and  after we met I really only saw him. He asked me to be his GF just a couple weeks ago right and I said yes. I do really like him and he feels safe! BUT, I've had so many friends tell me that I haven't even lived  here 6 months and I'm missing out on getting to know all different kinds  of people that the city has to offer.

25M here. I currently live with my parents. I have a Master's degree, a good job that pays well, and some assets (e.g. car). I am completely financially independent and could move out at any time. I have stayed at home a little longer because my dad's health hasn't been great recently.

Just remerging on the dating scene after ending a 2 year relationship in January 2021. Considering the best way to set myself up to meet someone. I live and work in a very unaffordable city so living at home provides significantly more financial resources to do fun things. If I moved out solo I would be on a tight budget. I do have places I could take a romantic interest away from my parents (I built my own cabin on my parents' country property on a lake).

I’m 23 going on 24F and don’t have too much dating experience. I am already someone that deals with general anxiety and I was happy to finally meet someone and see how things progress. 
Well I found out in the past couple weeks he deals with mood swings and has periods of sadness where he isolates. So it has been 2.5 weeks now since the last time I saw him. He was finally feeling better this week but still hasn’t asked to see me which hurt and I brought it up to him and I felt a bit better after getting a explanation/reassurance. But he has been taking longer to reply to me than in the beginning when he was pursuing me. Today was the first day he didn’t text good morning since we met. He stopped opening my goodnight reply’s after he texts goodnight. And we loosely planned to have a date this weekend and it’s now Friday evening and still hasn’t mentioned anything about meeting.
All these little things are making me anxious and I decided if he doesn’t say anything about seeing me by tomorrow I’m going to end things because I feel like I’m caring more than he is and it doesn’t feel good.

One day, we were walking past each other and when I looked up, sure enough, he was looking right at me. I smiled politely and he stopped and asked me if I have 2 dogs, which seemed like him trying to make a move and talk to me since I smiled at him. He stared at me really intensely the entire time. As I started to walk away from the conversation, he said “good to see you”. 

I happened to run into him later on the street and again, he stared at me really intensely. It was a little unnerving. I smiled and waved and he awkwardly did the same back but he looked extremely uncomfortable. 

Another time, I was coming down the stairs as he was leaving his apartment. When he saw me, he immediately started dropping what he was carrying and he raced to the door to hold it for me, while still dropping stuff. It was kind of adorable. He then said softly “there my dear”. I’m really shy and a cute guy calling me “my dear” like that just made me nervous so I just said thank you and ran off. 

When I saw him again, I smiled big at him and said hi. He just stared at me for a second with parted lips and flashed his teeth at me without saying anything. I held the door for him and he said thank you and sounded happy. But the other day my dog greeted him as he was leaving. I laughed and apologized and he just looked at me and looked kind of angry or uncomfortable (I’m not sure) and he didn’t say anything. He did pet my dog, though before I scurried away. It was weird.

I've never had any luck with it. I'm 25 and in university; I go to a commuter school that's known for being very unfriendly, so that's already a strike against me. I don't have any friends, don't meet anyone in my classes, don't hang out anywhere, so basically any way that I can meet people organically is out of the picture. 

At that point, the only two options that I have to meet people is online dating and cold approaching. Cold approaching is just completely out (see: unfriendly commuter school), especially considering that I see myself as ugly, and I've read so much toxic crap about online dating that I don't even want to bother. I've already dealt with a little bit of ghosting and I couldn't mentally take that constantly.

I can't take always being in my head, I feel like I'm about to die.

I have really bad social anxiety, and it makes my body tense up and tighten up so much it's literally physically painful. I've been dealing with this for a while (since 2009, so it's been about 13 years at this point), and that makes it hard to meet people or be my natural self.

i want to text her that i should remove her from snap and stuff but know deep down i should hold onto nc. i also dont want to just block her on everything as we have mutual friends etc. 

i have one friend i hang out with who i am very grateful for, just not a bunch i can constantly be doing stuff with. i am starting a new job the 12th though. 

does anyone have tips, and what have you done in the past? i feel that its been a while now and i should be over it. should i continue nc? i just miss her so much. 
thank you for any input.

* We went out drinking several times in the past month, and he was the one to always ask me to go out drinking. When we drink he always touches my arm when talking and offers his cup for me to take a sip of his drink. His legs also touch mine.
* He usually text me after 10pm about random stuff like being hungry 
* He introduced me to a few of his friends when drinking and they say he has been talking about me

This guy, Joe, keeps asking questions (eg. about the brands I wear, where I holiday, etc) and it makes me uncomfortable. 

I often wear higher end items (Loro Piana, Hermes, etc) because I like the quality, longevity, and comfort but avoid obvious branding because I don't want my clothes to be the focus of an interaction or relationship. I also wear affordable clothes (off-brand converse, secondhand plaid shirts, etc).

Joe doesn't wear brands, not that that says anything about how much money someone comes from. We aren't dating but we're talking and I want to know what to do in these situations in general because it's happened often in the past where people either try to suss it out or make blatant comments about ""my being rich"". 

I've dated people of much, much lower socioeconomic status in the past and money never came up in the initial dating. It came up later, but only briefly and the relationship ended amicably for other reasons. In this case, every time we hang out, this guy makes a few comments or has a few questions that feel like he's trying to suss out my socioeconomic status and it bothers me. 

I'm not attracted to him romantically/physically and worry that he'll accuse me of not liking him because of his socioeconomic status- or lack thereof and that that'll impact my study group, etc.

I'm just too much of a failure at life. I've only been on like 2 dates in my entire life, and I think that really is a reflection of how pathetic I am.

I have a whole ton of disabilities (ADHD, PTSD, autism/Asperger's, treatment resistant depression). I also have a visual processing disability. Yes, I'm seeing a therapist (two therapists actually) about it. But you don't get ""cured"" of these sorts of disabilities. You can learn to live with them and manage them somewhat, but they're lifelong.

I'm in my mid 20s and I still live with my parents. That's going to be a huge red flag for most people. I have a college diploma but I'm working a part time retail position right now that's only sort of related to what I want to end up doing for a living. There's no real openings in my field near where I live so I probably won't be able to get anything better for work for a while. And I'm getting to the age where living at home and working a part time retail job is no longer acceptable and starts to be looked down on.

Because of my visual processing disability, I also can't drive and I'm not very good with public transit either. I mostly get around with Ubers or rides from family or friends. That's going to be a turn off to most people as well because it sends the message that I'm dependent and need to be babysat. Nobody wants a partner who's going to be a burden on them.

I'm trying the best I can. With all of my disabilities and mental health problems, I have to work way harder to get even a fraction of the same results that most people have. For example this retail position is like 15-20 hours per week in good times (during the lockdowns it dropped to like 4-8 hours a week), but 15-20 hours still drains and depletes my energy.

You know all these posts about how exhausting a 40 hour work week is? Yeah, to me a 20 hour work week feels the way a 40 hour work week feels to everyone else. I feel like if I was working my dream job or something close to it then I might be able to handle 30 hours a week or so.

My point is that I need to work way harder than most people to accomplish the same results. Sometimes not even the same results. I'm behind everyone else my age and I feel like I'm just going to slip farther and farther behind as time goes on.

Pretty much nobody in the world will want to date someone with these kinds of problems. One of my therapists always says that context is important and people who know about how much effort I've put in and how I have high standards and ambitions for my future won't judge. The thing is he's been married since 1983, and whenever I look around I just see people looking down on and a lot of the time straight up mocking and making fun of people in my situation.

In fact it's **really** common for people here on this subreddit and others like it to say ""you need to have your career, your living situation, your finances, and your independent skills completely squared away before you even consider dating"".

I'm trying as hard as I can to get to where I want to be in life. But it's EXTREMELY difficult, it takes a LOT longer for me than it does for other people, and there's absolutely no guarantee that I'll EVER have my life completely together.

I guess I just don't deserve a partner. It's unfortunate but it seems like success in life is a requirement for it, and I'll probably never be successful.

P.S. - I am NOT one of those people who thinks getting a partner will magically solve all of my problems.

As I said I'm already seeing two therapists for help with my mental health and to help me cope with my disabilities. I don't expect, or even want, a partner to fix my problems. I can take care of my own issues.

I don’t really talk to any girls even just casually. I’m a senior, I’ve been crushing on this girl for 2 years, she used to like me 2 years ago but I was hella shy. So basically today I grew the balls to talk to her. But she basically didn’t seem interested I think. I came to Reddit for some help. So ima do the whole convo can y’all tell me where I messed up I’m person A she person B.
A. Yeo wassup, where you headed
B. Why?
A. I was tryna walk with you
A. What you got going on this weekend
B. I don’t know 
B. I work today
We start talking about work and school and shi, I think she bought up work. Accidentally said I was homophobic.🤦
Then I ask about her weekend plans again. She said she didn’t know.
A. Let’s get something going on Sunday
B. I don’t know *says by name*

B. Why you make it sound bad.
A. Nah we just gonna chill.
B. Okay I’ll hit you up 
I just walked away, cause she capping I don’t have her number
I took a huge win cause I got out of my comfort zone, but what can I fix.
I was like a 5/10 nervous, I just didn’t know what to say. Think I rehearsed too much cause I asked the what plans you go this weekend twice.

I've been single most of my adult life. 

I have a longing for a relationship, sex, to feel loved etc. 

Ive been out on many dates over the past few years and these are the problems I'm experiencing.

Get matched up, we chat over text. Sometimes big delays with replys, or opposite, people reply straight away. There's no balance and no time to vet out things like their interests, hobbies etc.

Some girls I've matched with want to jump straight into sex chat, flirting etc. I takes me longer to warm up to the idea of sex. I don't want to jump into bed with these people right away.

The last date I went on lasted 45min. We had dinner then after I suggested we did something else like bowling or something fun. She just said ""I'm turning in an early night bye"". 15min later I get a text, ""you're such a great guy, let me know if you'd like a second date"" . I didn't even get a proper chance to get to know them. It feels like people go out of their way to seem unavailable. And I'm on eggshells to let them know because I don't want to be accused of being clingy or something when I just want the time to get to know them. I turned down the second date but was nice about it.

I am 19M, working in a garage with a bunch of crusty looking 40+ men. There is a college co-op student (18F) who comes for a couple hours every day during the work week. She generally shadows the older guys as they have more experience, however will sometimes shadow me. 

I keep catching her looking at me. From across the 150 ft shop. Like eye contact almost every time I get up off the ground. 

She definitely keeps to herself around the others however she seems to be more open with me. She laughs what seems like way too much at my terrible jokes. Or I hear her giggling at my swearing/talking to myself (while working) if she’s close by. 

In the lunchroom, there’s one dude who makes typical garage racist/sexist/drug comments to which she makes a “wtf is wrong with this guy face” and looks at me… or laughs and looks at me… to see my reaction perhaps??

She’s very quiet although she’s still warming up to the surroundings and people. 
all I know is she definitely looks at me a lot. 

I would definitely like to know what I am seeing here.

I think I’m looking for validation of my thoughts. Or am I just going crazy.

We were incredibly happy, 2 children together, house, cars, jobs. We spent our last year, being bitter about having not developed as individuals, in the same capacity that we developed as a couple.
 And slowly we both realized that. We split up a few months ago, and I've been reestablishing myself, to be independent.

 I am, at this point, desperately searching for either a single mother, or single women in general, to chat with. Strictly normal conversation, what that leads to, is a beautiful thought, I still hold hope for. I haven't had a friend, other than her, in years. We just completely ignored, the entire world, when we were together. 

I am open to literally any type of conversation. I am incredibly ignorant, to how people date now. When I was younger, you met people by hanging out in the same places as them. Now, it seems that everyone does, whatever they can, to avoid ACTUAL conversation. I crave intelligent debate in any form.

She and I, currently on great terms. We have been successfully co-parenting for several months now. I have zero drama in my life. I grew up, in a very rough household, and I hope to find someone who can relate.

I am 5'8"", 180 lbs. I work at a Lumber yard, with a degree in biochem. I've got a hard work/gym body. I take very good care of myself. Physically, and mentally.
