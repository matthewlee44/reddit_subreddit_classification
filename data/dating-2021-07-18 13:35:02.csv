0,omwigd,1626633588,Is being the provider outdated?,"In my culture it's always been the man who plans the date, pays for the evening and takes on the provider role. I'm not sure how well this makes sense in Western culture. I'm dating a girl now who is in the same profession as me, makes as much money and could potentially make more depending on where we go with it. She's busy and doing her own thing. Which is good for her I would never want to get in the way of that. But it just doesn't make sense to me that I'm taking on some provider/leader role when we both have the same career. It just doesn't feel right. It feels like we should be splitting everything down the middle since we're both career oriented. But that doesn't make sense cause our dynamic was originally me taking on the leadership role. I guess I don't feel qualified to lead since we're both at the same phase in life.

1,omwl2m,1626633802,I don’t know if I like him or we just hooked up and i’m overthinking,"I [18F] have recently started using tinder. I was in a serious relationship and i ended it because he was emotionally abusive. this happened not long ago maybe around april. 
I’ve struggled with dating because of that experience, I’ve been very detached. And for some reason that relationship changed my view on sex and my feelings. I thought sex wasn’t and couldn’t be enjoyable and i at that point was emotionally exhausted and gave up on the idea of an emotional connection and attachment.
Fast forward to now. I’ve been on a few tinder dates i would say 3? 
none of them became sexual except for the last one. 
He took me to dinner and then we watched a movie and then we hooked up it wasn’t full on penetration but we still hooked up. And we did it twice.
This all happened last night and now i’m in a weird spot.
I’ve never done things outside of a relationship and I honestly hated the idea of sex and feelings, it made sick because of my past experience.
So experiencing this for not only the first time but after my last relationship has really messed with me.
I feel like I like him [20m] and am connected to him. Almost attached to him.
After we did what we did we cuddled and held hands and that made it WORSE LOL.
Im hurting because I don’t know what to do, i didn’t realize the security i had in hating sex and relationships and now that it seems like that’s withered away I just feel crazy.
I cant tell if i’m genuinely really into him or i’m just not used to this and it’ll fade.
He’s nice and all we talked i think for a 1 week or 2 before we went on a date and he never mentioned wanting to hook up and kept asking if i was comfortable and was just really nice.
He texted me right after he dropped me off and in the morning and has been casually texting me since then.
I don’t know what my takeaway should be from this and i’m just confused I feel very naive because I feel like i shouldn’t like him that it was just a hookup but at the same time i don’t know if my feelings are genuine or just a result of this new experience and it’ll pass.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/omwl2m/i_dont_know_if_i_like_him_or_we_just_hooked_up/

It didn't end up how I thought it would, but we decided to stay friends for the time being. 

Now, I decided to give her some time and not text her until she's okay, but she texted me the night afterwards, and we used to talk very frequently. 

Until, all of a sudden we stopped talking, she was very unresponsive, and it genuinely got me worried. 

When I asked about it, she got angry, and told me I should've handled that better, I should've understood that things wouldn't be the same, and I should've stayed away from her. She said that she wants a break and it's better we don't talk for a while.

4,omwxa1,1626634830,"""I deserve to be seen/known"" ??","My ex was very confusing. I would share with friends stuff she would tell me then ask, ""what on Earth does she mean?"" They would always reply, ""honestly, I have no idea she's very confusing. She seems a little crazy."" 

She would constantly get upset when I told her she was confusing. She told me her siblings would tell her she's confusing. She would declare, ""I am very clear. I am not confusing at all. You just don't want to know me. I deserve to be known!"" I would reply, ""I'm trying to know you, but even my friends say you are confusing when I ask their help."""" I'M NOT CONFUSING! "" she would repeat.

I never had any idea what she meant when she said she deserves to be known. Anyone hear this statement before? I've actually never heard anyone say that to me ever. It was always very frustrating, because no one can declare they aren't confusing... Of course they are not confusing to themselves. They are in their own heads. Confusing can only be judged from the outside, as OTHER people who aren't you are the only ones can possibly be confused by you, as they do not have access to your brain.

This was an argument constantly. She would randomly bring up something she was annoyed by. I'd ask her questions, bc I cared about her and truly wanted to know her, and she would just yell, ""I'm never confusing!!""

I see she made a YouTube video where she states it's great to be known and to be seen and and you just have to find the people who get you. You are not for everyone. But what if no one gets you and that is a common theme in your life? What if it seems no one is ""for you?""  I don't think she had any friends in town except her siblings, so I always wondered like why...? Was it because no one understood her and she would get upset with them and declare herself not confusing then turn away from them? I never wanted to ask. I just never understood her much and never understood what she even meant by saying she deserves to be seen and deserves to be known.

8,omxa0m,1626635897,I get attached too quickly,"I need to learn to slow things down and take it easy… I broke up with my fiancé last Sept and then got with a guy 3 months later who I’ve been seeing for 7 months. On and off… it’s a bit complicated and there have been lots of different pulls and pushes with it. He 100% helped me get over my ex very quickly. But I got quite attached to him quick quickly too. I think one of the main reasons I wanted him so badly is because I knew I couldn’t have him. He was an ex JW and was coming out of his shell and I was the first person he’d been having regular sex with. And it was really fun! He’d always told me that he didn’t want a relationship, which at the start I was very happy with. But the more time we spent together (a week over the Xmas period), I wanted a bit more. I decided to stop talking to him and deleted his number. But knew his name so messaged him on FB 🤦🏻‍♀️ He was glad I’d got back in touch and was keen to see me. So we hooked back up, quite a few times… and then I did the same and ended it, and again a third time. The wknd we decided would be our last, my step dad died and I had to rush off to my Mum’s and leave him at mine cos we’d been drinking. I asked him to leave me a note before he left and he wrote me the most beautiful letter. We do love each other but he just doesn’t want a relationship with me. I deleted his number again… and then found it on telegram 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ We ended up seeing each other this wknd because I’ve been really down and been signed off work with stress and basically guilt tripped him to coming and seeing me 😕 We had a really lovely wknd together and left with a hug and a kiss. But I’ve just started chatting to a new guy and already I am worrying if it will go further or if it’s just a fuck Buddy thing?? My main concern with it is we didn’t chat on Tinder, we matched, he messaged saying he doesn’t use it much, send him my number if I wanna chat. So I did, as I can’t be bothered with Tinder either. We sent our first texts Sat morn and I had just had the most random phone call from a guy, asking if I’d responded to a 3 some ad???! 😂 He’d written the number down wrong it turns out!! So I did kind of start the chat with him on the wrong footing by telling him. As you can imagine, the chat did get a bit kinky and we ended up having a naughty video call right then??!! So now I’m concerned that he’s done this many times with other ladies and if I do start to see him, I could get hurt again. I feel like i cling on to people and start scenarios in my head that really don’t need to be there. I’ve been signed off work with anxiety and as I’m writing this it’s exactly where I am in my head that’s making this an issue. I need to chill out and go with the flow and see what happens. Would you see red flags from the start of the chat?? He’s been really good over texts today and has assured me he hasn’t done that before 🤔",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/omxa0m/i_get_attached_too_quickly/
9,omxaj8,1626635944,"Is canceling plans for other plans, normal behavior?","I would intuitively think, no it is not. 

Ive been dating a girl for 1 month. We find our time together extremely fun and fulfilling. I really want to keep dating her for the long run. 

She explained she had dated before but I was the first person she has actually considered dating seriously. However, she knows she has a tendency to want to be able to act selfishly without hurting others. 

We set boundaries at being exclusive physically and emotionally. All good there. 

However, its been a few times where we ""agreed"" to focus in our own things for a few days and then agree to see each other in a specific day. Its been 3 times now that she cancels because something else she was excited to do, came up. We are both sporty and adventurous, we both are trying out free diving and bouldering, she practices parkour and I compete in brazilian jiujitsu. 

So I figured these would be very fun things to do together. But she decides she prefers to do them on her own, and that me coming along would somehow impede on her independence or sense of individuality. 

I dont mind having our own time. But I do feel hurt when I am looking forward to seeing her one day and she cancels last minute to do something else, that I would personally find interesting to do together. 

I try to not take it personally, but I am not sure if Im justifying her being too selfish to neglect my time and feelings. As well as a sense of me being ""safe"" and that it wont matter if we see each other because I will want to see her another day anyway. 

Should I dial it down and not take it personally or realize this is not behavior that I should be ok with and move on?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/omxaj8/is_canceling_plans_for_other_plans_normal_behavior/

14,omxybe,1626637971,"Has anyone had success getting an ex back after listening to the advice of a ""breakup coach"" on YouTube? I'm trying to decide which one to listen to based on my situation.","TL;DR - My ex broke up with me about a month ago, and I'm trying to decide whether I should text her after 30 days or no contact.

I (M25) went through a breakup about a month ago and I've been in no contact with my ex for almost 30 days now. I want her back, and there are several breakup coaches that I've found on YouTube who offer varying viewpoints on who should reach out to who after a breakup. I was dumped (the details are below if you care for them), and some coaches say that the person who was dumped should reach out after 30 days while others say that the dumpee should wait for the dumper to reach out, regardless of how long it takes. I'm wondering if anyone has had success with getting an ex back. And if so, would you mind sharing your story? I'm trying to decide whether I should reach out to my ex this weekend after 30 days of not talking.

If you'd like more details on my breakup, they're below: 

We dated for about a year. She broke up with me, citing a lack of physical chemistry as the main cause of our breakup. The day it ended she asked me to meet her outside one of our favorite restaurants. I knew that it was coming. We sat down in her car. She was crying. She was also shaking and she had trouble meeting my eye at first. But she did look at me when she delivered the fatal blow. She told me that everything else was good, but she just felt like our physical connection had withered. I can't know for sure if that was the only reason, although the one she gave was true - I had a lot of things going on in my life at the time leading up to our breakup and I was mostly responsible for a decline in physical intimacy between us. Once it was done she said that she wanted to be friends. I told her no, and that I still wanted more. We talked for about an hour while she answered my questions. I don't remember all of my ""questions."" It was mostly just the two of us dreading me leaving the car. I do remember asking her if she was sure. She looked at me and nodded. She said that she didn't see us getting back together, and that she was sorry for hurting me. But she said that she was thankful for the time we spent together. I got out of the car, and saw her sobbing. So I went around to her door and gave her one last hug before leaving. 

Anyway without going into more details, I'll just say that I have decided that I want her back, and I have resolved to be more purposeful in showing the physical intimacy that I truly desire to give to her. If she'll have me back. I'm not sure if she will, and I know that she said she didn't see us getting back together. But I know that if I don't try, I'll regret it forever.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/omxybe/has_anyone_had_success_getting_an_ex_back_after/

Me and her have known each other since high school in 2012 and were closely acquainted with one another through high school even until after high school. We shared quite a few intimate moments during high school as well.  While knowing her during that time i grew strong feelings for her and they only grew stronger as time went on. 

A few months after high school in 2017 we ran into each other at the mall and had a really fun spontaneous date which led to really passionate kisses in the parking lot, but then after our date, she disappeared out of my life for 4 years which devastated me. For a duration of that time I feared she had died and it has been confirmed through outside sources she had some really dark moments which severely damaged her hence why she’s the way she is today. 

About a month ago i found her facebook page and i couldn’t resist sending her a friend request because those old feelings came back,she accepted immediately. after a few failed attempts to get her to come on a date , the following week while me and other friends were at a vacation house, she hits me up asking me to hang out and actually shows up to hang for a while. While she was with us all she would not keep her hands off me, nor would she stop kissing me or holding my hand, all my friends saw and couldn’t believe it. We invited her to come to the club with us and she initially agreed but had to leave to get changed because her pants were ripped, she cancelled as well because she said she got her period but the next day she’s on snapchat kayaking with friends. 

After a few more failed attempts to get her on a date; she came over my place on wednesday july 7 after requesting to see me. When she came over we consummated our feelings and slept together. The next morning she didnt want to leave or stop cuddling.

 After she left she and I went back and forth until Monday last week when she stopped responding to me and started leaving me on opened. just like that she’s out of my life again and ive been sick the last week wondering what happened between us wondering if i’ll ever see her again. 

The last week my mind has been wondering with so many unanswered questions. I suspect i may remind her too much of her ex boyfriend because he looks a lot like me. Or maybe i could’ve said something or did something to make her go cold. I don’t exactly know, but I really need closure.

17,omyeq3,1626639352,Want a relationship but always turning girls down,"I'm a (19M). Girls have had crushes on me or liked me but I've always turned them down. I'm a pretty decent looking guy I'd say or it's what I've been told anyways. I have also had groups of girls ask me if I wanted a girlfriend or what type of girls I like. I just ignore them or just sorta change the subject. I remember 3-4 different girls that asked ME out and I liked them but I turned them down. My family always ask if I'm talking to any girls and I usually just say something silly to ignore the subject.

The reason I think I do this is because I feel like I'm not good enough for them, not physically but wealth and popularity. I've always been poor, my family is poor and I don't have a big social media presence. My home is a horrible embarrassment I feel like that looks old and falling apart. I just don't feel like I'm in a position where I can offer a nice date or even a nice living to a girl in a relationship. All I have is me and the time I have to offer. I try to take care of myself physically, working out, skincare, etc. 

I have only ever tried to talk to 1 girl last year and it seemed to be going alright but then she ghosted me. She's the only girl I've ever messaged. I had a strong attraction towards her and she gave a lot of signs she was attracted to me but I looked at it as karma for rejecting all the girls I have. Got a taste of the rejection I had given I guess lol. It took a lot for me to even talk to her because I felt like I wasn't ready or wasn't good enough.

The only reason I messaged the girl last year is because I told someone about the deep attraction  I had towards her and they said I should shoot my shot because you may not be attracted to another girl like that for a long time and I figured it was sound logic. 

So I want a relationship but don't feel ready I guess. I feel like once a girl gets to know me she'd be no longer interested.

But once we are apart is like he has forgotten about me. Twice already I was suppose to come to his house and sleep there but he canceled at the last minute to see his friends or friends of work. 
Like any other girl at my age I struggle with body image even though I pretty ""standard"" (whatever that means), seeding nudes or stuff like that is really hard for me. Yesterday I had the courage to do it, he opened the photo but simply didn't responded, I hasn't expecting a sea of complements but something would have been nice. I told him that it wasn't nice what he did, he saw the massage and didn't responded. A bit angry, I messaged him saying that if once again and he left me on the open I would block him everywhere 
Surprise surprise... He saw the message and didn't responded 

Like I said, he is my first relationship so everything is new to me and I don't know how to act in certain situations, for example he has a LOT of female friends. They often go to his apartment and stay there until late at night. I once confronted him about it and he assured me that they are all just friends, sisters even...
I let it go because didn't want to seem jealous or possessive but still bothers me a bit.  

Now I don't know what to do. Do it block like I say I would? 
It will definitely create a conflict but that is the last thing I want, I just want for him to be there for me, respond me

Well, this isn't the update I wanted to post, but it's one I'm coming to terms with. The first date went spectacularly, and the second was even better. Like with what I said in the original post, she wowed me in ways I had never experienced in my dating life—or with any of my previous girlfriends. I was beyond flattered. The second date ended with a pretty heavy makeout session, and she let me take home a few things to 'borrow' from her house. We kissed goodbye, and she told me, ""I'm free like most weeknights. See you in July.""

She was in and out of town for the better part of a month. Over that time, she introduced me to a friend of hers. Her friend gave me an AC unit for free I badly needed, and I took that as a good sign. Although this girl isn't a great texter, we'd still flirt and chat. We made plans for a third date at a beach.

That date was supposed to be today. I texted to confirm plans, and unfortunately, she said she got with a friend of hers and she wants to see where that will go. I'm not mad, just disappointed. Looking back I suppose I could see it was tailing off over the last week—around the time she was with her friend—but my point still stands: I am so grateful for what she did to my self-confidence. They remain the best dates I've ever been on.

She wants to be friends, and I believe her. I want to be her friend too. I let her know what I said in my initial post on r/dating; I wanted to let her know how much I appreciated her personality. Her response was kind and endearing. Honestly, I still can't believe someone as stunning inside and out was/is into me. Such a nice feeling.

I have no reason to be mad at her. I'm sad. But, you know what? This is the best I've handled a rejection—and it's the kindest way anyone's ever rejected me. Thank you to the universe for putting her in my life. Whether or not that's the end of the story doesn't matter, I'm happy she's in my life.

Thanks for the kind and supportive comments everyone.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/omykjm/update_i_had_one_of_the_most_pleasant_dates/

26,on02u7,1626644527,Going with the flow but need a little bit of help,"Im a 19F talking to a 24M. We matched on Tinder late March and ended up hooking up. I initially wasn’t planning on seeing him again, but he was pretty cool so I had asked to him hang again. However he had gotten sick and we just never revisited the convo. We didnt speak for about three weeks and then he hmu one Friday evening to meet him at a bar. It was the week before I was to leave for the semester to go back home so I said why not. We had a bit of fun and I stayed at his place for quite some time the next day before I went back home. We also hooked up/hung out the last two days I was on campus and then I left. 

For the past 11 weeks since i’ve been home, he’s been keeping contact with me almost 2-3 times a week with some conversation on Imessage or DMs. Sometimes, its everyday. It takes him time to respond sometimes, but that doesn’t bother me as he always ends up responding regardless. He also randomly snaps me what he’s doing sometimes or will double snap me if I leave him on opened. I enjoy talking to him when I can. But I find it kind of odd that he’s still contacting me when I really only knew him for a week. Currently, I’m okay with the “patchy” communication we have so far because we’re in two different states and are also not together. He also has been asking me every now and again when I’ll be back, as he did two days ago. However, I’m trying to figure out if he’s talking to me just cause he wants to sleep with me when I get back or do something more.

I don’t mind just hu with him but it was already implied that I’d hu with him when I come back to the city in a month because we already have. We’ve talked about doing “activities” over the past two months I’ve been home, which have consisted of going kayaking, cooking together, etc. I guess I’m just trying to gauge his intentions but am confused by his actions. I usually don’t talk to my hookups this much not unless we were friends prior.

I've struggled with an eating disorder for about 21 years (I'm 31, non-binary) of my life, its been a very difficult battle but have thankfully found a more balanced place with it. Due to ED and body dysmorphia I haven't felt able to date for some years now, I didnt feel like someone who looked like me (I'm fat) was deserving of pleasure, so I stayed hidden from the world.

 I finally feel ready to start dating again but feel scared and anxious. I'm at my recovery weight and I'm not small, I'm healthier than I've ever been though but I'm still so anxious about people potentially body shaming me. I also am a survivor of child sex trafficking, so intimacy in general feels terrifying. I've been in therapy and such for years and am significantly better, but there is still that anxiety of being hurt by someone else. 

I've been denying myself closeness with another person because of trauma and mental health issues, and I feel like I'm at a point in my recovery where It'll  be good for me to be close to someone in a romantic way. If any other fat folx, folx that have struggled with ED or severe sexual trauma have any advice on how to get back into dating, I'd love to hear some.

32,on0npt,1626646297,How to handle hot/cold attitude,"I’ve been friends with this guy for a few years, we’ve only had one bump in the friendship and it was started by someone else. This past year we ended up getting really close over some common interests, it was brought to my attention by his best friends that he “wouldn’t fully admit it” but he caught feelings, we had a discussion early on about past relationships and what both of us expect from our next relationship and surprisingly wanted the same thing but I was hesitant at the time due to mutual relationships and how it would affect those dynamics and so was he. 


We were fine until a couple months ago, where he started being hot and cold, he told me from the start that he has no problem doing stuff in person but when it came to texting he would never text first, he hates texting but respects that I like it but it was on me to initiate it. Also before anyone suggests meeting up the past month and a bit we’ve actually been working opposite shifts so when I’m awake he’s sleeping and vice versa.  That’s fine, he did give me a heads up about it. 


My issue is sometimes I text him and he’s an absolute delight, we have great conversations and it feels like no time has passed since we’ve seen each other but other times I’ll text him and he’ll be very short to answer or come off super moody.  


I guess I’m just  not sure if I should deal with it and wait until we see each other again in person to discuss it or if I should just walk away and lose the friendship too, which I don’t want but I also don’t like being nervous when I text him because I’m not sure which version I’m going to get.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/on0npt/how_to_handle_hotcold_attitude/

Do I need time to process getting ghosted or is it okay to move on to the next guy? I feel a bit strange going to the next one without closure or time to reflect. But I’m not gonna track down the guy and force an answer nor will I sulk and blame myself for the situation.

I was like “i don’t care about the effort… it’s surely worth it”. And i still think that way, but not for every relationship.

I’ve been on 2 dates in my entire life. I knew the first girl on Instagram, but she was the exact opposite of her instagram posts. So i learnt a precious lesson: some people can REALLY look like models on instagram, and be way less attractive ( surely not ugly, tho ) in real life. 

The second girl was a girl i found cute. She wasn’t objectively looking too, but i felt something different when i first saw her ( we are classmates ). Our first date was cool, everything was nice, but then i saw a 30/35 yo woman behind that girl. She was STARING and SMILING at me every 5 seconds. And she was very beautiful. 

From that moment on, i realized how important looks are. Ofc, loving a person is not just loving her looks: it’s basically loving that person as a whole. But when i noticed how shallow i am, i realized i can’t have a relationship yet. I need to lower my standards, because i’m not model-tier too. I’m pretty average, i just got a nice physique and i’m tall. 

So, the problem is that i won’t be able to be loyal ti a girl if i’m not physically attracted to her. That’s the main thing, the most important one for me ( i know it’s shallow to say, but i can’t deny it anymore ). Ofc, if a beautiful girl has a shitty personality, then i won’t be attracted to her anymore.

51,on2de9,1626652146,Dont sacrifice your mental health for someone elses,"A story about my last relationship; started off as friends in university and developed into a relationship. She comes from a traditional family and we are from two different countries that happen to not like each other, so when she told her parents they blew up, even theeatening to kick her out, and their relationship hasnt been the same since. This made it hard to see each other but we managed to have classes together plus enough gaps between classes to be able to go to restaurants and other little date type things in secret. The idea was to wait out the storm, let parents relax into the idea, and get ourselves into positions where the opinions of parents didnt matter.

Fast forward to the pandemic and now we couldn't see each other at all, both because of her parent's being controlling and both having family members with serious health risks. She also suffered from mental health issues, which up until this point wasn't anything that turned me away or made me reconsider the relationship. She relied on me for support and i was happy to be it, and she was happy to be mine when needed. But during quarantine, being constantly distanced from each other and her friends while being confined with abusive family members her mental health went downwards and she became severly depressed and suicidal. The long distance while not even being able to call each other as well as constant fighting over nonsensical things and her jealousy began, and it developed to the point where i found myself not wanting to talk to her for fear that something i would say would spark another fight. I would see my friend circle once in a while to workout or hike and such and she became very jealous of my female friends in the group which was heightened by her inability to see me. She believed that I would leave her for one of them once i got tired of waitinf for her, which was nonsense to me, but i couldnt convince her otherwise.

 This cycle ended up making me feel depressed and trapped. I wanted to leave but I knew that i was the only person she relied on for any form of ""normal"" human contact and to support her mental health. She had even mentioned a few times that if it wasn't for me she mightve already committed suicide. I know that sounds intentionally manipulative, but i do believe she meant it, and didn't realize how manipulative it came off. Even though i wanted out of the relationship I felt like i couldnt leave because I still cared about her as a person since she was a good person, and I was genuinely worried what she might do to herself if i did. So i stayed for 7 more months after that. During that time i became very depressed myself; my grades dropped, i gained a lot of weight from eating my feelings, i started distancing from friends, and losing sight of my own goals in life. 

Eventually i came to a breaking point and ended the relationship. I've been on the mend for a bit now and feeling, and looking, like myself again, but i still think back and regret how far i let myself slip and how many opportunities to advance in life, like scholarships, research opportunities, and more, that i lost during that time due to how far i had let my mental health slip. 

Im not advocating at all for anyone to abandon their SO if they have mental health struggles, just that you be aware of if you're sacrificing yourself too much mentally for another, because it can be slow and sutble.

55,on2oag,1626653219,Feeling insecure about how little we communicate now?,"
I’m (F23) talking to a guy (M27). We’ve been talking for 3 months, but honestly it feels like I barely know him that well because we talk maybe once a week. Even then, sometimes it doesn’t get past hey how are you doing/how’s your week.

Am I wrong to feel upset about this? I haven’t addressed this yet and I don’t know if I even should. I don’t want to sound needy or immature (he is a few years older so I don’t want to run the risk of looking childish)

In the beginning, he texted more often, and then I started initiating more over time. I once recently called him to ask for advice on something and that led to a 2 hr phone conversation, but after that I have not heard much.

I like him a lot but I really want more frequent communication. We often talk about getting serious with one another. 
In my opinion, if you’re serious about someone wouldn’t you wanna text them more than once a week?

On one hand I’m thinking that maybe he feels so secure in how things are going between us that he doesn’t feel the need to check up and text🤣😂 jk
No but maybe he's just older and might think it's silly to text often?

I tried stopping to text him first all the time and that just resulted in us barely talking in over a week. It seems to not bother him. He assures me that he wants to be with me but I feel so insecure (what if he's talking to someone else? What if he's literally in a relationship with someone? What if he slowly is losing interest?) (I don't mean to seem needy it's just that past relationships/experiences have made me want to feel more secure in communication)

So how often do people who are getting to know eachother talk/text?

How can I ask for more communication efforts?

TLDR: Talking to older guy, we talk about  wanting to get serious with each other, but he never texts first and the lack of communication makes me feel insecure.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/on2oag/feeling_insecure_about_how_little_we_communicate/

60,on34e3,1626654883,How I Genuinely Connect With Any Girl On A Date,"When I \[25M\] approached my last girlfriend \[26F\] at a Starbucks, I didn’t expect it to go anywhere. We had very little in common: interests, industry, upbringing, lifestyles. We even spoke different languages (she's Japanese, I'm Filipino). We switched back and forth with Google translate just to fully understand each other.

But I had a “template” flow of interaction that helped me genuinely connect with anyone I’m talking to. I've learned it over the years because I'm a normally introverted, shy guy.

**Without this template, we would’ve just been two strangers who chatted over coffee and went our separate ways — never knowing we could’ve fallen in love.**

I've learned it’s easier to connect with someone on a date and have an amazing time when the interaction flows a *certain* way:

# Have a 3-Location Plan Ready

In my experience, going from one location to another, when done well, significantly increases the feeling of closeness. Like those cliche movie lines; “I feel like I’ve known you forever. Even if we’ve just met.” The closer you feel, the more at ease you become. And your best selves come out more naturally.

**Location 1: A place of Introduction**—Someplace you can have an easy conversation. Low pressure. Get-to-know. And don't talk about dry topics like work or hobbies. Probe on Conversation Themes and play some Games (see below).

**Location 2: A place of movement**—Give your bodies the opportunity to communicate. Go for a stroll or a dance club. It gives contrast to the date. Connecting with someone isn't just limited to talking.

**Location 3: A place for Intimate Conversation**—This girl and I met at a Starbucks, transferred to a bar where I told her about different local drinks, had a stroll at a nearby park while listening and dancing to each other's ""guilty-pleasure music,"" and finally, we walk to a spot where we can watch the city lights. It's quiet, and above us, stars. We talk about our dreams and passions. Then we share our first kiss.

# Conversation Themes

I used to memorize scripts, lines, and PUA routines. But that won't get you far in the long run. I also don't want boring conversations about work and the usual stuff. If you have very similar interests, then that's great you can talk about that. Just be careful you don't trigger her friendzone radar. So instead, I focus on these. I found these themes bring more emotion into the convo, and I don't shoot myself in the foot by giving her ""buddy"" or ""best friend"" vibes.

**What drives your date**—Probe how or why they choose to do their work or hobbies. Try to see where their drive and desire are coming from. And engage them there.

**What exhilarates your date**—Don’t make the date too serious. Probe at fun things too. My usual go-to is music. Most people are passionate about certain music. And it's a great jump-off for flirtatious dancing or singing. And no, I'm a terrible dancer/singer. But that doesn't make it any less fun.

# Games

Never underestimate the activities you did for fun at age 10. They just might brighten your dates now.

Think of Games as an add-on to your conversation. Like intermissions or bridges to deeper connection. You can whip them out to break the ice, put on a certain mood (intellectual, playful, flirty, etc.), or even increase physical intimacy. You may use drinking games or Never-have-I-ever, anything fun, really.

# Final Thoughts

My last girlfriend and I were very different people. But with the template above, I learned we were actually in the same phase in life. She had just quit her job to travel abroad. And I had just quit my job to move to a different city. We both uprooted ourselves to go after what we want.

In my experience, being in the same phase in life affects a relationship more than we think.

Dating involves luck, sure. But it relies more on the people doing it.

I remember one day we meet up, she said she was going to come dressed up buggy  tomorrow because she won’t have much sleep so she won’t have any time to fix her self in the morning and I told her it was fine and she said why are you saying it’s fine I don’t dress up to impress you.  This hurt me bad not because it’s my crush saying it it was because of the look she give me she looked at me in disgust like I’m someone not worth dressing up for. She looked at me like I was trash. It hurt me so bad on the inside not because it’s my crush if any girl said that to me it would still hurt the same. 


A few weeks later it was just me and her in my accommodation working on an exam together and she was constantly fixing her self makeup, eyelashes and even said she’s going to the toilet to find a mirror to fix her hair. It seems like such a contradiction I thought you didn’t dress for me so why are you fixing yourself so much when it’s just me and you? 

She always gets overly excited over my complaints she even said she don’t know to response at times to my compliments. She always plays with her hair around me and fixes her makeup. She looks at the ground after I compliment her.

71,on3wdg,1626657712,Great first date but no second??,"So I went on a date with a guy literally like 5-6 weeks ago. It went really well (from my point of view) he even asked to see me again and if I would like to see him again, when we were on the date. The whole time he was saying how much fun he was having and made comments like “we should just get married already” 
So after the date, I didn’t contact him, but he messaged me the next day and since then he hasn’t stopped saying how much fun he had and how he would “love” to see me again. 
In between I did go on a holiday and the whole time I was away he was saying that he couldn’t wait for me to get back so we could see each other again. 
I’m just super confused as I don’t know if he’s keeping me at an arms length because on our first date he did mention he’s had a bad history with his relationships failing due to no independence and he just wants to focus on his job and studying? So I let him know I was very independent and learnt that was something I needed to maintain from my last relationship also failing due to that. After that he seemed way way more into the date and complimenting me the entire time.
Now there have been times where he has asked if I was free a Saturday to hang out and I’ve told him I’d have to let him know, then he ends up being busy. I’ll take it as him not being interested but he will keep up the interest in messaging me constantly and mentioning how much he wants to see me again? I’ve even put myself out there and asked him if he was free and he’s said yes but when it comes to the night before or day of it just never happens? Again, I pull away but he starts talking again how much he wants to see me, sending funny videos or flirty stuff? Now I’ve just started assuming he’s just waiting for a hookup opportunity, which I’m fine with so I’ve moved to more flirty casual type of texts but now he’s going as far as saying “we should go see a movie together” asking how my weekend was and what I did or if I’m cooking and post it on my story he will reply “you should invite me over for dinner and cook for me and I’ll do the same for you” 
We talk DAILY and if I don’t message him all day he will even go as far to double message me. 

What the hell is going on? Why is he acting so keen to see me STILL if he wasn’t interested? I’ve had dates with other guys in between that I can tell weren’t going anywhere and none of them have had a problem with just ghosting me or slowing down the communication to the point where we don’t talk anymore? But he has continued to make the effort to keep it up but he’s not taking action??? I know actions speak louder than words but I do really think this guy would be so so fun to hang out with again as I had such a good time with him the first time, which is why it’s so hard to just stop talking to him. Why if he just wanted a booty call, has he not messaged me late at night to come over? He doesn’t do any of that? If he’s wanting to see me he will ask me a week in advance but either he will end up having an event he can’t get out of or I won’t be available!

I already know all the reasons why someone would cheat and stuff. Not enough affection, chronic depression, just plain out you're an @sshole, etc. But still, WHY!?!

And when the impact of the realization and this weird negative feeling hit, I feel as if I'm now disillusioned with the whole idea of love or the idea of a trustworthy partner in general.

80,on4fiy,1626659703,Can someone help me understand the difference between being a gentleman and being desperate?,"Coming from a conservative family where I have always been told to make things easier for women, whenever I am with a woman - be it on a date or just with a female friend, I always tend to go the extra mile to help them out..  
A few examples of my behavior include :  
1. If they are holding a jacket or a bag, I offer to hold them. I don't offer to hold their purse.  
2. I pay for the food/ drinks.   
3. I offer to drive them home or pay for their cab or parking price.  
4. I don't initiate physical contacts when on dates. Never force a kiss..  
5. I am a bit concerned / anxious if they want to drive home past midnight - if they live 50+ kms away.  
6.  I keep asking them if they need anything.  
7. Try not to be pushy / dominating. I align to what they want. Vegan restaurant? Ok. A good bar? Ok. Coffee? Ok.  Whatever works best for them..   
8. When picking a point to meet, I ask them where they would be comfortable meeting and pick a spot that works best for them and not for me.   


What I am observing is that this behavior might be coming of as creepy / desperate in the modern dating situation... It is no longer romantic to be thinking about making life easier for a woman...  I know things change with time.. What was expected a few years ago is considered creepy now-a-days. I am wondering if there are any recommendations on what is considered ""gentleman behavior"" vs what's considered ""creepy"" in the current dating scenario. For example - asking them what they want to eat and if they know any good restaurants instead of imposing what I want to eat in a restaurant that I think is good. Is this considered creepy or nice?",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/on4fiy/can_someone_help_me_understand_the_difference/
81,on4go7,1626659827,I think I love him? But he gets on my last damn nerves. What should I do?,"I live in D.C. and met this guy 3 months ago on Craigslist (lol it's a long story). 

We are both 26, both Capricorns, and I am black and he is white. I am queer and nonbinary, and he is straight. He told me he loved me on the very first date, which was also the first time we met in person. I assumed that was a red flag, but he seemed genuine and we DID hit it off pretty well right away. Within a month I found myself saying ""I love you"" back and realized that we were moving fast. To pump the brakes a bit we discussed our ""status"" and agreed that being in a relationship wasn't ideal for either of us right now, and that we should remain open and casual. The sex is bomb and we are genuinely very into each other which is amazing, so things have been going fairly well as they are.

Howwwwwwever.

The problem is that this man also happens to get on my last damn nerves quite often with some of the things he does. In an effort to air out my grievances more concisely, here is a quick list:

He still sucks his thumb (a habit I am trying to get him to stop)

Despite having a decent job, he also regularly sells drugs on the side

He recently paid someone for their urine in order to pass a drug test for a promotion at work

Several of his friends are openly homophobic and also very into drugs

He farts around me a lot and laughs it off with halfhearted apology

He plays World of Warcraft almost everynight until 3 in the morning only to complain about being tired everyday

He doesn't know how to iron

And he likes to wear pajamas as actual clothing, IN PUBLIC

Worst of all though ---and my biggest problem with him--is that he is a sloth. We joke about it often, but it truly gets on my last damn nerves. Often, whenever I sleep over at his place or he sleeps over at mine, he will say ""wake me up early so we can go do XYZ"". Cool. I'm a morning person and I love to get up around 8 or 9 to start my day. 

So, I set the alarms. And, everytime without fail, he will groan, roll back over, and continue sleeping for an additional 2 hours, and wallow in bed FAR longer than he initially claimed he wanted to get up. His slothiness often ruins my plans for the day and, even though I enjoy his company, I am still left feeling lazy/unproductive as soon as he leaves.

Aside from all of these issues, he is a very funny and kind soul who sincerely loves and adores me, with a big heart for his friends and family. He is super supportive of my gender identity and life aspirations. 

But all of these little things keep adding up!! I fight the urge to end what we have at least once a week. Is it wrong to feel so embarrassed by him in public? Or to say ""I love you"" while also feeling ashamed to claim him as anything beyond a fuck buddy and Netflix companion? Should I end whatever this is entirely (since it HAS only been a few months) and just walk away while it's still early?

I am so conflicted about what I should do. HELP!",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/on4go7/i_think_i_love_him_but_he_gets_on_my_last_damn/
82,on4k73,1626660172,She has been very weird with another guy and it worries me,"Ive been with my girlfriend for two years and everything seemed ok. We still have a solid and loving relationship but I’ve been kind of worried about this dude she has at work. I’ve found out through someone else at work that things are very weird between them. She never really speaks of this dude, I met him only twice.

Ever since she transferred to his department they have been very flirty with eachother and this has been going on for the past 7 months. She is playfully touchy with him sometimes at work where he has something she wants in her hand and she will start trying to take it away from him by holding his hands and wrapping herself around him. Or she would randomly hold his hand and would play around with his tattoos. She lets him touch her around the body without saying anything. She also gets very jealous if he talks to another girl. They seem to be flirty around throughout the work day.

I went through her texts and they text eachother a few times a week and its nothing sexual, but there is definitely banter happening in the texts.

84,on4vnd,1626661343,I ran into my ex for the first time since our breakup,"I ran into my ex for the first time since we broke up

Earlier today I ran into my ex for the first time since we broke up. 

Back story, we dated for 7 years. He bought a house last year and we planned on having children and getting married. Our break up was a shock to me. Completely blindsided we had just got back from vacation and he broke up with me two days later. He said he hadn’t loved me in 6 months and was “trying” to get the feelings back and they just weren’t there. This was 3 months ago. 

We have talked twice on the phone briefly after the break up (two separate occasions) when I sadly begged him to not end the relationship and to see if it was salvageable but he brushed me off. Adding he wanted to be alone and not with anyone and that he’s not in love with me but has love for me. After that I stopped reaching out. 

I saw him today at a store we both go frequently but both had been avoiding since us ending. I walked in grabbed the items I needed and saw him sitting at the counter. I tapped him on the shoulder and he took a double look, shocked.. lol I asked how he was and he said he was good and talked about his job (he got when we broke up) I asked how our cats were and he joked saying still little s***s and then I proceeded to check out. We exchanged some more words very casual and then at the end I gave him a hug and told him happy early birthday since it’s in about a week. 

I feel great about the encounter, I actually looked good I’ve also lost 30 pounds since the break up and I held myself together unaware of how our first encounter would go after no contact. I can’t deny I of course still love him, sad we are no longer together and wishing it could be different but I know I can not force someone to want me. I wonder how he felt about the encounter if he’s been thinking about it like I am? 

How strange to only hug and briefly catch up after we’ve spent seven years together. I don’t know. I also don’t want to damage the progress I’ve made healing during these three months. 

Someone have any advice? Can tell me how your first encounter went when you saw your ex for the first time? Did they ever reach out to talk? Also just needed to vent..",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/on4vnd/i_ran_into_my_ex_for_the_first_time_since_our/

As I’m walking, this girl I crushed on a little walked by. From what I can remember, she looked up at me but then looked back at her phone. I asked her where the office is. 

During the conversation, she was avoiding eye contact with me. Also, her voice was actually loud enough and I’ve read how loud tones can be a sign of attraction. 

Now the conversation was short-lived but it’s been on my mind lately so I wanted to get some answers. Looking at these, I think she might’ve been nervous talking to me which also can mean she had little crush on me too. That’s just a theory. It may not be the truth.

Imo you should NOT work on yourself for the sake of just trying to have a dating partner. You should work on yourself for the sake of improving your life. Basically, don't factor romantic relationships at all into the equation. Talk to people for the sake of forming friendships, not for the sake of entering relationships. If you're working on yourself for the sole mission of trying to get a boyfriend/girlfriend, that's not really working on yourself; that's still being desperate to find a romantic partner. I know this may sound harsh, but if your end goal is trying to enter a relationship, then I think you may need to re-evaluate your motivations and decisions in that sense.

89,on5gk5,1626663575,"Polar opposites, but hard to let go","I met a girl on a dating app a few weeks back. She instantly stood out from the rest due to her genuine personality and attitude. She seemed cute so I asked her on a date. It went pretty well, a bit awkward here and there, but that’s common I would assume. 

The issue lies in the type of people we both are. I’d consider myself an introvert and enjoy simple things. I am religious and grew up in a relatively privileged home. This girl however definitely has that “emo” aesthetic. She has very different interests to mine and, not that it matters, but is someone that my parents wouldn’t approve of. She is super nice and is easy to talk to I’d say, but sadly I feel like it can’t work. 

But there’s still a part of me that wants to take her out again, regardless of all I’ve said. She may also be thinking the same thing, but idk. I know it seems vague and the obvious answer to is to kindly tell her how I feel, but how do I do it without making her feel sad or myself feel like crap?

I'm not even trying to look for my soulmate , either , it'd just be nice to casually date and have someone to talk to semi-regularly when time permits.The thing that sucks about this whole situation and is holding me back I believe,  is that I live in the suburbs , and I'm also in the process of actively saving for a vehicle in the not-so-distant future .

He has a huge exam that he is taking for his career coming up this week (the most important test of his life). He’s been studying for 10 weeks at least 10 hours/day, 7 days a week he told me. We’ve been on 3 dates  and have been seeing each other for only a little over week (I slept over his place the 3rd date). We have a lot of chemistry and feel very comfortable with each other, spend our time together laughing, discussing deep topics, make out constantly, and talk about our childhoods. We have not had sex, but have essentially done everything but. I told him I don’t have causal sex which he was understanding of but there is a strong mutual attraction which makes adhering to that personal rule very difficult. We talked about what we were looking for I said down the line a relationship and he said he wasn’t necessarily looking for a relationship but was open to one. We talked about what we want from a person he said independence, ambition, passion and I said communication and mirrored the traits he said. On our last date he said he was taking a trip during the 2nd week in august so won’t be available then (and said he wanted to communicate that to me since I said communication was very important to me). Idk whether or not I should take his recent poor texting habits personally as a lack of interest or chalk it up to him being incredibly busy. He takes several hours to respond and recently asked for a rain check for our next date which in person he said would need to be after his exam but never said what day his exam was. In response to his text I simply said sure, good luck with your exam and have a good week (as I assumed he would be too busy to talk this week). He didn’t respond to that text so I might be getting ghosted but it’s also not a text that I think requires a response and makes it clear I don’t plan on hearing from him until next week. Dating is rough I’m not sure where he stands but I’ll see in a week if I’m ghosted.

This second time around, we got together five times, and once again it looks like he's decided to end it. 

I know he's a good and decent person who's looking for a serious relationship and he probably thought he should give a relationship with me another shot because I'm sweet and attractive. Maybe he was hoping the second time around I would be more confident and relaxed around him. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. 

Anytime I feel like things might get serious with a man, I become so nervous around him, which inevitably turns the man off because I behave uptight, and any responses I make to his jokes or stories come across as insipid and inane. 

In my mind, I'm constantly thinking, ""You have nothing to talk about! Think of something witty! Think of something interesting to talk about! Don't say that, it might sound stupid!"" And then my mind just goes blank and the date ends up being a disaster because I seem like I have no personality, when in reality I'm hiding my true thoughts and feelings because I'm so afraid of rejection.
