That night I FaceTime to her and honestly I told her at first that I was only down to fuck while on tinder but after when we FaceTime‘s we talked about a lot of other things and I changed my attitude towards her. I really wanted to get to know her and maybe even pursuit her. So after that night she texted me throughout the day and started every conversation. She kept making funny sexual jokes but were lighthearted and eventually she told me directly that she didn’t feel comfortable with just having sex right away and that she wanted to get to know me which is exactly where I was as well. So we went on a date the next day after FaceTiming that second night. I took her into the city and we walked around four hours. 
She grew really warm to me. She started walking into me as we were walking down the street, when we sat on benches she got really really close to my face. She shared extremely funny details about herself , but overall she kept laughing at everything I was saying. We went out to dinner and I was super exhausted so I wasn’t fully there but she grew even more interested it seemed. She started asking me personal questions about my family and other things and we really enjoyed the dinner. When I dropped her off at her car we started making out for 10 minutes. She was so into it she even put her knees on the passenger seat just to get a better angle but she absolutely does not strike me as a girl that just wants to have fun because she doesn’t have a whole bunch of friends and she just broke up with her boyfriend like three weeks ago. Anyways from the time I met her and saw today today her Snapchat score has literally only gone up like 20 points. However today her Snapchat score is going up almost 300 points. I know that sounds funny but we met on tinder and my concern is that she is just keeping me around while snap chatting other guys. She texted me today little stuff but never anything about going back on another date. I want to date this girl but I’m afraid that two things may be happening. First is that she sees me more of a friend and secondly if she is snap chatting other guys I guess I didn’t read her well enough because I thought you really really was into me. So if there’s any girl out there that can tell me if it’s normal for girls after a first date to keep snap chatting guys just to maybe expand your options or should I be concerned.

So I started a new job recently and I have a massive crush on the person who trained me. I think the feelings are reciprocated but I’m honestly unsure. We’re both in store management positions so the situation is hard to read because we are both hard working professionals. We are both in the same position and we don’t work at the same location. (Both store managers for different locations) there was heavy chemistry from the start and it seems to only have increased.  I nonchalantly mentioned my ex boyfriend (who I was previously still involved with during training) and my trainers demeanor changed when I brought him up. He seemed uncomfortable and became quiet. During training he was extremely professional. Once we went off site on business he became more personable, asked me about my interests. We developed a really good rapport and have been playful with one another, lots of joking and giggling. I never giggle, just to put things into perspective. He helped me set up my store for grand opening and definitely went above and beyond his job description in the process. Might just be a really nice person that’s looking to move up in the company, which we sort of touched on when I asked what he earned in return for assisting my new store at this length. He didn’t seem to have any ulterior motive, just said he was doing it out of kindness and wasn’t gaining anything in return. I honestly thought they would be rewarding him in some way. After my opening we’ve still kept in contact professionally. I call him for support typically once or twice a week. He’s always been so patient and willing to take time out of his busy day to help me, whereas other SMs I’ve reached out to for support are short or in a hurry (understandably so, we work for a very busy retail chain-no one has time to breathe, let alone go out of their way to assist other stores) During his day off he actually came to my store, which was quite a commute, to pick up his supplies that he left behind. He ended up spending three + hours at my store just helping me with questions but mainly just chatting, while being off the clock. Are people really just this nice?! Maybe I’m misreading genuinely kind intentions, but I doubt it. My intuition is always spot on. I don’t want to make an absolute fool of myself and considering this job is really important to me, I need advice.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,884630,public,self,I have feelings for someone I work with and I don’t know what to do,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ofyb6u/i_have_feelings_for_someone_i_work_with_and_i/,all_ads,6,,,,,

I shot my shot, and completely air balled. Actually, I don’t know what happened. You tell me.

We get into work, normal day, but I didn’t see her for the first hour, so I’m thinking she bailed on her last day, I did that once so I wouldn’t even blame her. Turns out she just had to work in a different area at the beginning of our shift.

So we don’t get to talk until later, it was pretty busy, but I’m like once I get my chance I’m pulling up for the shot. So after an hour of a rush of work it’s finally just us 2 and I go for it.  My exact words, “wassup, how you feeling today.” She says with a smile “I’m good, how bout you.” I said “same, this your last day right?” She says “yeeeeaaa.” Held that yea for a second too. So I say, “well if I don’t get a chance to talk to you before you leave, just know I’m wishing you the best of luck on whatever you do after this, and I’m kinda upset we didn’t get a chance to really get to know each other, but I’m rooting for you nonetheless.” She didn’t respond to any of that, like completely went in one ear and out the other. I was completely shook.

But get this, if you read the first post, I speak about this little eye tag game we played, she tried to continue it. Like huh? I was so upset I couldn’t even look at her, it felt like I was left on read, or ghosted after texting for a week or 2. Now she doesn’t owe me anything or whatever, I was just really sick because I was expecting a response of some kind, not a no response at all. 

So later that day it was so awkward, I was helping out in her area and it seemed she didn’t know what to do with herself when I was there. She was pacing back and forth, excessively looking at her phone, kept turning her back to me, but every time I walked away I could see her out the corner of my eye looking at me. 

I don’t know, I don’t think I could’ve did anything different. Maybe I read our situation wrong, and she wasn’t interested at all. Or maybe she got something complicated going on who knows, certainly not me. I’m kind of bummed though because I was truly interested in this girl, but hey. I do wish her the best though.

So I (26m) broke up with my ex (22f) about 2 months ago, we had been in a 2 year relationship.

There was no cheating from neither of us, the reason we broke was because she was distant from me, she didn’t told me many things, she lied to me, we didn’t lived together because she never wanted to move in with me because she said she would only move if we got married, which at first didn’t bothered me but eventually it did, and I wasn’t happy in that relationship.

When we broke up I told her my reasons and she wasn’t happy about it, but she didn’t went insane in that moment, she told me that maybe it was a good idea that we took some time for ourselves, which seemed like a nice idea, I didn’t considered the idea of ghosting her because I don’t hate her or anything like that.

After about 2 days since we broke up she started messaging and calling me, telling me she misses me and wish we would be back together, I told her that we both agreed not to talk to each other for some time but she kept talking so I just silenced her notifications but I still reply to some of her texts so she doesn’t fill lonely or something, about 2 or 3 days later she went to “pick me up” after work but she didn’t “picked me up” in her car, she asked if she could come to my place to hang out, I said no and just offered to take her to her house, and she’s being going to my workplace for the past 2 months!, I always take her home, but at this point I’m really getting annoyed and I’m also considering ghosting her so she leaves me alone.

I already told her that I don’t feel love for her anymore and she really should forget about me, but she doesn’t give a crap

Was I a jerk for telling her that I don’t love her anymore, should I ghost her?

i've been trying to date for the past few years but nothing has ever worked out. i've asked my friends to set me up (they don't really know anyone or if they do, by the time they think of them, that person is already in a relationship), tried just existing and having a social life (pre-pandemic) and tried online dating. nothing has ever worked and i don't know what's wrong with me. i am doing great in my career, i think i look cute and i have tons of friends who all think i am great. even my very close friends who i would trust to tell me the harsh truth have told me they don't know what's wrong. 

last month i met this guy on an app and we clicked which has never happened. we've been talking basically everyday since then and for the first time ever i felt like it would be possible for me to meet someone. i was so excited. even finally getting to experience what it feels like for someone to be interested in you... that's honestly what i was the most excited about because it's never happened and i'm 26 and that's so abnormal. but due to unforseen circumstances i had to go away for most of the month so we couldn't meet in person. and by the time i get back he will have moved to a new continent. 

what if this was my one chance :( i know i've never met this person but it was so exciting to feel like something was possible for once. and it's not possible. i feel like this is a cruel joke. like why even let me have that hope if i'm just going to be alone forever :(((((( help me please idk how but i just feel so hopeless. everyone is going through all these exciting life changes - moving in with their partners, adopting dogs together, getting engaged and married, going on trips... and i'm just here on the sidelines watching it happen and my life is the same as it's always been. literally my life has not changed since i moved away for university when i was 18. i want to die. i want to experience the same excitement and joy that my friends are experiencing. :( i just don't know how it will ever happen for me.",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,884759,public,self,26f feeling really discouraged,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ofzn91/26f_feeling_really_discouraged/,all_ads,6,,,,,

I've seen everyone around me have relationships that I would consider good and successful that last at least a year before ending up not working out, including my drughead uncle who managed to pull three different significant people into his life for successful relationships despite not working job, and with his last relationship while having a car smashed up in my garage for over a year and a month that just recently got pulled out of there still pretty ruined because we were tired of having it there. But I've still yet to have a successful relationship personally. The issue is probably with me... I'm an Aries and tend to be very up front and honest with things, because thats how I like things to be. I have Asperger's so I tend to find some things a lot more interesting than others and tend to gravate to those things, and because of that like to live my life outside the norm. I consider myself a Gray asexual, because I value personality and doing things together over sex or physical attraction, and I have a very specific view of what I want in a girl and also my future to be like, that most girls seem to not want to fit into... I'm also part of a spiritualist church and have had multiple mediums telling me ""its just around the corner,"" and even signs from the universe telling me to keep holding on. I don't swipe too much on dating apps, but have them in case someone swipes on me, because I can usually tell even the blurred pictures who swiped on me, but even then I never get a message back. I perfer going to events in public whenever I can because I used to enjoy the spotlight of my career choice before 2020 took that from me, but I've never got a girl to talk to me at the events, and there have been two different times where I've talked to a girl before, then other people got involved making the girls think the wrongs thing about me, and I'd end up in trouble (once in high school where someone else came up to the girl and said that I was sending her messages asking for nudes so they decided to try to go to the councillors about it to get me in trouble for it until I told the councillors to look for the evidence of me asking either of them for nudes and of course they didn't have the evidence because I didn't even have their numbers, and then again in my career where I asked a girl out, got rejected, was okay with it but one of her former ""friends"" saw, tried messing with me first and when I told them off about it decided to make fake accounts and lead her to believe they were me harassing her, thankfully she must have smartened up later because when they had a ""Speak Out"" movement in my profession, she never did a post about me like she would have if she still believed that it was me, but she did do a post about someone else who was around her all the time at that time and also said ""he caused heat between me and my coworkers""). Those incidents compounding my social awkwardness make me prefer girls to come up to me first. The closest I have ever been to a potientally good relationship was at an event where a family told me that a girl liked me but she kept denying it. I believed her and aired on the safe side, until the event was over and I was working cleaning it up. She gave me a look telling me that she liked me as the family walked out the door, but I was too busy to catch up to her, so I hoped that she would come back and she never did. 2020 happened and one of my bosses responses to the Speak Out movement that was happening made me quit the profession all together since it seemed to support people who abused women.

Here were the two scenarios where I think I blew it:

Scenario 1: Was on a hike with the girl. She invited me back to her place about halfway through. We make our way back, got a little lost. The car was across a big lake, and I made a joke without really thinking it through where I said “too bad we can’t take a boat to get across” and she replied “well if we’re that desperate to get back we probably could ask someone.” 

Although the tone was in a joking manner I feel like a bit of desperation/neediness slipped out and made things weird. When we got back to the car she said she needs to see her friend who’s going through something, so we just hugged and I went home.

Scenario 2: Different girl, I asked her halfway through the date if she wanted to get wine and go back to her place and she said that sounded boring, and wanted to stay out and keep bar hopping. Later on I brought her home, and we made plans to hang out next week. Nothing happened, we didn’t hang out a second time and when I asked her how she felt she said she didn't think it would work out.

I started to sense he was trying to cancel on me. So I asked if we were still going to see each other. He responded with “I feel that you would be upset/disappointed. I feel like I’m on a wheelchair.” 

It made me mad and I didn’t respond. He texted me later that night at 9 with “😢”. Again I left him on read. 

Did I overreact? I just feel like he could of told me that when he woke up for his game and if he could wake up for that than he must not be that hungover.

I said he’s half black and half white. She got furious and told me she’d never agree with me dating a half black person and that I need someone middle eastern.

I was very attracted to her. After one date, I felt like the date went really well and I really wanted to see her again. The conversations felt very natural and she laughed at my stupid jokes and shit. She said she had never felt so at ease with a guy so quickly.

We spoke a lot through text afterwards too and I thought we were doing well. She told me a lot about her ex family-in-law who are being massive dicks to her even to this day and how her kids feel the effects of it.

Anyways, I asked for a second date and now she says she didn't really feel the ""click"" and the ""instant chemistry"" and that if we see each other again, it's not with the prospect to be in a relationship. She said that she found me a super cool guy and it's rare for her to find a guy she gets along with so well, that accepts that she has kids and with whom she can talk so relaxed to and literally told me ""it almost feels like I'm letting a chance pass with you because I went on another date and that was no relationship material either. He just didn't have your intellect and wit"" (her words)

She even invited me to her place to watch a movie alone with her at night while the kids are gone, but then she ended up cancelling this the next day because of said ""lack of chemistry"". 

She said that apart from a relationship, she would be happy to have an extra friend though.

I respectfully declined. I've been in the ""lets just be friends"" territory once in the past. No more. I swore I would never allow myself to go through that painful bullshit again.

This is what I answered by text (translated)

""I appreciate your directness and I'll be honest with you too. I'm not looking for just friendship and I won't pretend I'm fine with being just friends. If we're destined to be just friends, I prefer to decline because being friends with someone I'm attracted to is self-inflicted emotional torture I have no desire for. I think it's better we just break contact. I wish you a happy life""

I want to make it *absolutely* clear I didn't reject her friendship out of anger or hate. It's purely self-preservation. I don't wish to put myself through that self-inflicted pain so I pull the plug. And that's that. Furthermore I have enough friends already and have no need for new ones.

She replied she understands and that if she only encounters the wrong type of guys from now on, she'd keep my number for in case she seeks an honest, honourable man.

That last part kinda offends me. So basically, I'm her last option and I'm only good because others are scumbags? What am I a fucking Nice Guy? Is she honestly saying I'm just a backup guy she hangs on the coat rack so she can take me back when she needs me? Either way, not gonna stick around for this crap.

I mean that. I don't know that there was ever a time where it was truly different, but it seems like more recently there's come a certain set of trends.

I'm more or less new to the dating scene, 22, male, but I've been doing some lurking and... man, there are some patterns I just don't get.

1. Why sex? What is the focus on sex? I understand it's biology, but what happened to personal appeal? Sharing interests? Helping eachother? Being two halves to complete the image?  
Sex seems like more of a romantic thing, something nice between close couples to be understood and enjoyed, but not to be the crux of anything. What happened? Why is that so paramount?
2. On the one hand you have crazed desperate men, and on the other you have desperate and often burned women. There are plenty all around who seem to just want someone to be with, and yet it never seems to happen.  
I just find this almost baffling. I know that people struggle, but... it's almost like the two groups that need each other never get along. I'm not going to ask why; I get it, but it is very discouraging to see.
3. While we're there, why pics? Why does everyone ask for pics? Aside from hygiene, does the appearance mean so much?  
If someone's healthy, nice, and you click, does it matter.  
Why is physical attraction the pinnacle of starting relationships? I mean it seems like that shouldn't mean all that much, not really, at least not beyond a fleeting interest. It's like looking at a painting and finding that you like it, but we're not paintings! People are more complicated than that, beautifully so. Yet, if that attraction is not there, then the discussion is often closed. Why?  
I've actually done a couple experiments before regarding whether the majority will say they'll be fine with someone who has no solid appearance at all, like a deformed burn victim or some poor soul who utterly lost the genetic lottery, and most of the time those answers are quite kind.  
...  
I'm not sure that follows to practice, but I'm not sure.
4. It looks to me like there's a very distinct back and forth where a whole bunch of people both hate and long for dating at the same time. It's like a war.  
""It's horrible!""  
""It's not!""  
""Everyone's terrible!""  
""They're not!""  
Can't we just agree the answer's probably somewhere in the middle and get on with it?
5. Why is it so shamed *not* to be a part of the dating scene? It's like if you aren't there at all, you're some kind of subhuman cretin. Why?  
People have anxiety. Maybe they're working up the gumption? Or they're not interested...? Or they're struggling? Why is failure or exclusion or disinterest ridiculed? Shouldn't they be encouraged? Most of these people aren't doing well.  
I'm not talking about fiends with a keyboard and liquid vitriol, just sad or disinterested folk who happened to say something.

If you're still going, thank you! I'm glad at the least to be heard. Yes, I'm rambling, yes, I'm venting. I hope though that at least some of this sparks some kind of discussion, even if a small one, and, you know, I'm glad to say it.

The point is that I don't get it. Was this ever about the personality, or has it always been this way? Am I naïve? Is that it? I don't know.

What’s been happened with dating in all these years? Is everything on an app now or is that just because of the pandemic? Why am I reading things about people following and unfollowing and talking on IG? Do people date through Instagram now? Why is Tinder still a thing? Haven’t women learned better?

I’ve spent this last year and a half so caught up in homeschooling and geeking out on SpaceX and COVID research and well, after I’m in a good place again (and I’m getting there already) … I’m confused about all these dating apps. This is what grown ups are doing now en masse? Cuz that’s a really great way to end up with a Prince Charming Sociopath (FYI).

The ""How could I have not seen this coming?"" ""How Could I have let this person do this to me?"" All of these posts have one thing in common. It's people who think that there is some magic bullet that if they had known sooner, would have stopped them from being vulnerable to abuse and manipulation. And this is the part that might sound depressing, But there is no magic bullet. EVERYBODY is vulnerable to manipulation. While some people (Specifically people who were raised in good homes and have very little trauma to cope with) may be more resistant to falling into an abusive relationship. It is IMPOSSIBLE for anyone to be immune from it. 

I will provide a link in the comments(Dating doesnt let me put links in the post for some reason) to a website that lists alot of the different forms of manipulation, and their names. This is really important because while you may instinctual know that something being done to you is wrong. But without a name added to it as validation, most people will doubt themselves wither or not they \*should\* have felt like they were being manipulated. When there is a actual name added to it, you can gain the confidence to know that the reason it feels wrong is because it IS wrong! I know it helped me tons when dealing with manipulative people. 

HOWEVER........ more bad news

Even with knowing all the offical names of manipulations you will still not be immune from it. And this is because of a certain quark of people who are predators. These people have more or less spent their entire LIFE literally obsessing over how to manipulate people. Which means by the time you are in your late 20's, you are facing off against someone who has been practicing how to manipulate you for nearly 2 decades. Ask yourself if you would feel bad if you were to get into a competition with someone with 2 decades more experience than you and then you lost? Maybe a tinge of sadness yeah, but then you tell yourself it just makes sense. However when most people are manipulated by someone who has been practicing the art for decades they will often degrade themselves, tell themselves they should have been \*better\* or \*smarter\*. They don't often realize that them being victimized was not a reflection of their own competence, but a reflection of just how good some people are at manipulation. (i will provide a link in the comments to a video of the interrogation of a serial killer, the video shows how easily the sociopath controls the conversation. And while it might seem obvious to you when watching the video, to the people who were there, they didn't realize it was happening until they later reviewed the tapes and realized just how much the sociopath controlled the situation and these are people who are literally TRAINED to spot it.)

This might come across as a weird mental health post in a dating subreddit, but my heart aches whenever I see someone degrade themselves as if them being victimized was their fault. Cause while yes, there are things you can do to help you spot it and pick up on it to protect yourself. No one will ever be immune. And if you then proceed through your life being paranoid about figuring out how to spot these people before they can do damage, you will only make yourself more vulnerable to it.

I suppose my real point is to stay safe, do research on how to spot toxic people and be proactive about your own mental health. But realize that if in the future you are taken advantage of, its not because there was magic tactic you should have known, its because we live in a world that only cares about who survives, not what they did to survive. You being cheated on wasent because you are lesser, it because the cheater was a predator who knew how to target you. You being abused wasent because you deserved it, it was because the abuser was a predator who knew how to make you feel like you deserved it. And honestly the best tool you can have to combat them is self love. Because the more you respect yourself, set solid boundaries and take care of yourself, the more resistant you will become to manipulation. But it will never be foolproof, and there will always be someone who knows exactly how to get to you. It's kinda like the idea of being struck by lightening. Yes it can happen, yes there are things you can do to mitigate the damage, but no amount of obsession over preventing it can truly protect you if a freak accident occurs. So it's best to give up on the idea that you have total control over it. And instead just concentrate oh the things you can control.

She and I was talking and going out a lot in the fall, but we were never a couple. Problem is, I had fallen pretty hard for her, and she’s basically got everything I’m looking for in a woman. Like literally, every personality quality and trait that I think would be important to have in a long-term relationship. We like way too much of the same things and have way too many interests in common, more than I’ve ever had with any other girl ever. And physically, she’s exactly my type. 

She expressed at the time that she was no longer interested, but then every time I was around her, she would act like she was into me, but when I would try to start things up again, she would tell me no. I loaned her some tools to fix her bedframe not too long after we stopped talking and hanging out/going on dates, and she seemed to want something from me, but I didn’t take things any further than that. In hindsight, I probably should have, her interest (at the time at least) seems pretty clear now. 

 I can’t stop thinking about her, and every time I see her I think she want a second chance with me, she always looking at me, or walking close to me/right past me, (she knows how fine I think she is) and one time I heard her switch up a conversation with her friends to a subject that she knows I like when she observed that I was close by. 

I been trying to see other girls, try to move on, but the thought that she might still want me kinda ruins all my other dates. I can’t really get past a second date with these other girls. On days when I don’t see her, sometimes I feel like I’m moved on, but then the next time I see her, and I make eye contact with those beautiful baby blues, I’m back to square one. 

But the thing is, I respect her word that she wants me to “back off” from pursuing her. If she told me she doesn’t want that then I won’t. But then there are days when she does these things that seem so deliberate, almost like she’s baiting me into trying again. Maybe it’s just a confusing hard-to-get game and I’m just a little too oblivious to know when and where to apply a little pressure? 

I want her to make a definitive decision to choose me. I kind of put the ball in her court, so to speak, last time we talked about this, so I feel like she should probably be the one to make a move on me. I figure, she’s a big girl, we’re all adults, if she really wants me she’ll tell me.

And look, I’m not an unattractive or uninteresting guy. I think I’m pretty good looking, and not too bad with my shirt off either, to brag a little. Pretty good amateur MMA fighter, I have dreams, ambitions, a job that pays OK. I make friends easily and I feel confident tht I can make interesting conversation with basically anybody. I’m certainly not a professional comedian, but I also don’t feel like I’m unfunny, like a good middle ground. I feel, at least, like I’m a catch. (Am I THE PERFECT GUY, no, I’ve got a lot to improve on, but I feel like I bring a lot to the table as a romantic partner)
