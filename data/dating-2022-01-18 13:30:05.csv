1,s76212,1642535252,I'm invisible to men,"29 F
I have pretty much given up on ever meeting someone who isn't using me as a slump buster, like I get it I'm not an attractive woman. But supposedly your other redeeming qualities will actually attract a long-term partner, I really think that is bs for anyone who is below average. I know you are supposed to be working on yourself for your own well-being but, I can do that all I want and still get no where with dating.

I'm independent, I make my own money, I bought my own home, I am trying to improve as much as I can. 
I've put in a lot of work on my physical appearance I've lost weight (only weigh 110 lbs), I've tried different hair options. I've tried to expand my interests even when I hate the activity I go anyways, most of the things I actually enjoy are solo activities like reading. I know the pandemic has made meeting people in person an issue but even pre-pandemic I have never had any luck. I used to go out every weekend with friends and get ignored by men on the regular who just wanted to talk with my more attractive friends, the only time men have ever payed any attention to me was for cheap hookups, or as one guy put it 'I just took one for the team so my buddy could get laid'. 

Dating apps are a joke no matter what gender you are if you aren't physically attractive, I get that but how are you supposed to actually get to know someone if you never get a chance to begin with. I don't shoot for the top men, I know that I don't have a chance. I always try to stay close as I can to people of my league, but men I do match with never want anything beyond sex.

I am generally fine with being alone, I just do the things I enjoy. After a while though all of my friends have partnered up and I'm the only single person left. Yeah I can still hangout with them but I'm always the 3rd wheel. It just gets old being alone all the time. I've been in therapy, I keep thinking I'm the problem here. My therapist keeps saying I'm not and that what really counts is inner beauty. Problem with that is no one gives me a shot to even show any 'inner beauty'. Looks fade and all that, but I never had looks to begin with, tried photo feeler to see if I could find more appealing photos, I've never been rated higher than around a 3.5 on attractiveness. I'm just pretty much at a loss for ever finding someone, I don't think it is healthy to lower my standards anymore at this point.",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s76212/im_invisible_to_men/

Unfortunately when people are making the decision to match with you or not you don't have much ability to convey any of that. It's almost solely on how you look physically.

Granted, I was covering my mouth with my hand, but I dont know how much that makes it better. It really did not help how dry the sandwich was, as it was taking me even longer to eat each bite and swallow.

And she was like oh okay how’s your day been. And I said it’s going pretty meh just feeling low and she said I hope I feel better. And right before I left I built up the courage to tell her she looked really pretty today and she grinned hard and looked at me deep in my eyes. And then we said bye again.

My only concern is when it comes to marriage and having children (we are both from cultures where marriage is quite common and a valued practice).

We both want marriage and children however I do not want children until I am 33-34, at this point, he would be around 45 years old. I fear that is too old for a first time father? Although there is no rush or actual timeline, I can’t imagine having kids in your mid-40s would be fun and exciting. He does not seem to mind that he would be an older first-time father but I do have concerns he may not have the energy to fully support me in the child rearing and such.

12,s76xwz,1642537539,How do you stay hopeful with finding a partner?,"So I’m going to ramble a bit here. Just vent a lot of my worries and thoughts as of late. 

My biggest concern at the moment is time. I recently got out of a 5 year relationship at 27. I feel extremely pressured to find someone else. I’m still hurting from the breakup, but I hate being single even more so. My ex has already moved on and I feel I need to as well. 

I haven’t been single in 5 years and the thought of dating again scares the hell out of me. I’ve been considering the dating apps, but the consensus seems to be all over the place with those things. The general takeaway seems to be though is if you’re a man it’s a lot harder. I’m just not sure how else to meet people, given I’m naturally a pretty introverted person. I only found my last two partners through work and school. 

A big comment I often see is just ignore finding someone and just focus on life and it’ll find you. I think this is baloney and just an anecdote to help people not feel so defeated. My current lifestyle with following that mantra would leave me single for probably many years as my day to day doesn’t really involve meeting many new people. At least not to a level that could build any sort of relationship. 

I’m currently working on myself and trying to get my self esteem back. I don’t think I’m an ugly dude, but dating at this age seems vastly different then my early 20’s. that might be just due to the fact that I’m doomscrolling dating crap on Reddit, but it seems daunting now. The dating landscape looks rough. 

I’ve learned that I tied a great deal of my self worth into having a partner in my life. I feel like without one I come across as this pathetic, bitter, and unaccomplished man who is incapable of having a woman in his life. 

I don’t know what I’m asking or looking for here, but any and or all advice with dating would be appreciated.

13,s77177,1642537770,Opinion on dating long distance coworker?," I'm going to try to make this short and sweet but bear with me - I am a 24F and my coworker is 28M. We have been working together for the last couple of years, but I work in the office doing admin and he is out of state working in the field. He was recently promoted, and we've had to talk quite a bit when it comes to the progress and documents needed which means we've also gotten the chance to get to know each other. Just to be clear- we aren't in the same department and don't manage or have authority over on another. It's more coordinating than anything and there wouldn't be an issue with that in the future as our job placements are so far from each other. His voice alone is probably one of the sexiest things I've heard, and I've seen a couple pictures of him from social media I've lurked on and it's safe to say he's my type to a T. Over the last couple of weeks, we've really enjoyed talking to each other and stay on the phone for an hour after talking about work just to talk to each other on a personal level and I think the vibe is mutual.

One of my best friend's boyfriends also works for the company and she goes out to see him often. We decided to take a trip together in a couple weeks to visit them and I'm overanalyzing every bit of it because I feel like this is my now or never chance to see if it'd be possible for us to take it a step further. He knows I'm coming out and seems excited but we definitely both play it safe and don't go out of the way to flirt with each other too hard and make it obvious. On the other hand, I'm debating on if it's even a good idea to attempt anything considering the work relationship we have on top of the distance. He lives in another state than I do aside from where he's working, and if we were to date there'd be a lot of travelling and compromise along with talk about which state we'd move to for each other. I know I sound crazy planning that far out, but I like him so much just from over the phone that I'm fairly confident I'm going to meet him in person and melt.

I usually wouldn't go out on a limb like this, but something about this screams I'm missing out on the opportunity if I don't try regardless of the hurdle.

14,s772d8,1642537848,Never been in a relationship/dated…,"So I (21f) have never had a relationship or have dated anyone ever. I feel like it’s probably stemmed from the fact that I’ve never been around or exposed to what a normal healthy relationship should look like. I haven’t seen my parents ever be affectionate in front of me so I think that might play a factor? I’ve liked people in the past and from what I’ve known, some people have ever liked me back but if I ever get the feeling they want to pursue something more, I immediately step back and just self sabotage any chances of there ever being a relationship. Now that was when I was in teens, maybe around 16-17? Then, until now, I haven’t expressed any interest in pursuing anyone because the thought of being romantically involved with someone else gives me a ton of anxiety. I get all up in my head and thinking about what if they get bored of me? What do we even talk about everyday when getting to know each other? I always had low self esteem/worth. I always think that physically, I think I’m average but there are days where I look in the mirror and can’t see what I can possibly bring in for guys. They wouldn’t like me.

I’m like I didn’t want to be with this guy, I’ve hung out with him 5x. There’s no reason for me to be sad! But I am and me being this sensitive makes casual dating so much harder.

30,s78zg6,1642542805,Advice for 50+,"So I am back in the scene after having mutually decided with my best friend and gf that the romance portion of our relationship is no longer present. For the \~4 years between my separation/divorce and prior to meeting her \~8 years ago, I was rarely wanting for dates and was often able to maintain several simultaneous relationships, and that was great. And whenever any one rose to the level where I wanted to be exclusive, I did so, and that was great. I was exclusive with my gf for \~3.5 years before this recent change.

Now in my early 50's, I don't have a real driver to get back into all that. I'm still open to allow whatever to grow organically, but I have neither the time nor the interest in maintaining multiples. Like, I've developed interests that don't leave me much time to date, so I think I'd like to just meet someone new and be somewhere between casual and dedicated relationship.

I'm sure my profile could use the normal upkeep, but the landscape so far seems to have changed. I'm getting a lot fewer likes back, and some women have been downright mean in messaging, a couple like from the very first sentence. I don't mean that in a woe-is-me way, I just mean it like something seems off.

I could barely get hard when she needed me and by the time I did I climaxed instantly. It was embarrassing. She was supportive, but it really sucked.

Years ago I didn't have this problem I could go and go, but since I've started dating again I've lost all my sexual confidence. In the 5 years I spent single I did masterbate quite often and I'm really hoping I haven't given myself a form of ED.

32,s796k6,1642543298,Help me with this date,"I know this girl around 2 years already. We met online and we always spoke through WhatsApp. Because she lives in the other side of the world it's difficult for meeting, specially now with the pandemic. 
This year I was finally able to book a flight to her country and today was our first date. She blew my mind, she is a person so unique to me and I love it. All girls I know either liked partying, drinking, etc. This girl is really classy, likes to stay at home, read, go to operas, etc. During our meet it was really tense, she looked like a really reserved person, she was somewhat serious, when we had something good to talk about she would laugh and keep it going. But eventually she would come back to be serious. Neither of us didn't know when to stop the date that we were in that restaurant around 4 hours. 
My question here is, how can I make her more relaxed with me, I really love this girl and want this to work. Right now we are just friends, because I'm a foreigner I asked her to show me the city or do things with me. I know it's too much to ask, but I'm here 2 months and getting that visa was not that easy, so every day counts.
 We agreed to meet tomorrow, I asked her what plans she had and she said none. I'm here because of her, so obviously I have no plans either. So second date after 12 hours, we will go buy tickets for ballet this Sunday, and we will go to museums and after eat. I really like her, but I don't know how to make her feel at ease with me. It's the first time I meet a girl like this, she's so unique to me that it's worth asking for guidance in this subreddit. 
I'm also very scared, from experience I can get girls very fast, but this time I just couldn't. I was scared every second of making a mistake, I think I did but was able to minimize it later. I also can't read her mind, so it makes it really hard for me. 
Having said that, this person is kind of a stay at home girl, classy girl. Is it too fast if I try to hold her hand? I feel myself stupid asking this question, it's not even kiss or sex. But I like her, and I want this to work, it's very stressing for me. I feel that if I go like friends I'm also giving her power to friendzone me, I need to make my move but I don't know how to do it.

After some much needed self-reflection, I realized I needed to take on a new perspective when it comes to the online dating “game.” I didn’t owe those guys anything. I didn’t know them, so why did I let them get to me? If they don’t want to talk, no worries. I’m sure someone else will come along. I know my worth and I don’t need to brush that aside. I think I was just so hyper focused on feeling lonely that I let it get the best of me. From now on, I’m going to stop putting a lot of pressure on myself. 

Much to my surprise, I matched with a guy the day after I published my original post. I feel SO much better about keeping it low key. I haven’t checked my phone every hour like a crazy person, and I just enjoy our chats at the end of the day. I’m happy to report that I have a date this Friday! Not putting a lot of pressure on that either. I didn’t enjoy feeling like shit after the last few times I ended up being ghosted, so whatever happens, happens.

35,s799ta,1642543529,She semi-ruined it for me with an NSFW picture I didn't ask for,"Most of you would probably tell that I'm crazy for saying this but hear me out. Between the age of 20 and 23 I had a couple of casual hookups that really fucked up my sexuality. I identify as a bisexual trans woman and my head was just spinning at some point because I not only got too attached to someone but I also didn't know who or what I was, followed by some really heartbreaking comments like ""I'm glad we just kept it at sex"". I don't fucking trust people anymore. I was also ghosted twice on a Tinder date. Some switch got flipped where I just don't fall in love with people until I know them more than 4 months.

So 2 days ago (4 years later from all that horrible stuff) I decided to give Tinder another spin. I matched with a girl who's into bondage. I think the conversation finally clicked when we discussed what we'd do but I still felt like things could have started off better (my body and mind just function differently these days). She said she is looking for a relationship but she's also very open about her sexual needs, let's put it that way. Then she said she wanted to share some of her work (on other people I believe), I said sure why not. We exchanged numbers and she send some pics. I told her I couldn't find anything on my google drive to share with her. She said that's too bad, here is one from me, which was a full nude and all I could think was ""wtf, why did you have to ruin it like this by rushing this""...

I don't know if porn desensitized me over the years but it just didn't do anything for me (also, her head is not in the picture btw, there is also no tattoo on her belly, so the earlier photos were definitely from someone else). I just feel like nudes or seeing someone nude or being nude with someone is something that happens along the way, not within the first 48 hours!

It was a nice conversation. After we get off the phone, a close friend of mine whom I haven’t talked to in a few weeks calls me last night to hang out. I tell him he can come over and he does. But unbeknownst to me he brings my old fling along and announces that they’ve been dating for two months. Okay, would’ve liked to know you were bringing her over and also her and I spoke a few times over the last couple months and she never mentioned him.

37,s79l05,1642544348,What is it about Men and the “L” word?,"Ok, I’m fairly young (23F) but I feel like the men I date who are around my age (give or take 1 year) are terrified of the “L” word—not love, the word “Like.”Every time, and I mean every time I have told a guy I like them (usually within a month or so of dating), they flip out. Like do a complete 180. And it’s not even me saying it to try and push for a relationship, it’s just to give them piece of mind and reassurance—a little self confidence that I am into them for more than their generosity when taking me out on dates. 

For example, this one guy who I was talking with for about a month (23M), had been asking me out every weekend. He texted me everyday, and he was kind of dorky (I found it to be adorable) and seemed a little nervous on dates even though I felt super comfortable. He seemed like he liked me way more than I liked him, but then one time after hooking up after a date, I casually mentioned that I liked him a lot and would love to keep seeing him. For real, every other confession, first move, and comments of interest were all made by him—which obviously told me I should reciprocate and hopefully make him feel a bit more confident. It just did the complete opposite.

The next time we hung out it was a different vibe and he basically told me he wasn’t ready for a relationship…. But I didn’t ask for one nor did I feel as though it was even appropriate to have that convo a month into dating. He said he wanted to keep seeing me but that he was scared that I was too interested in him all because I said I liked him (even though his actions and things he said to me made it seem like he liked me wayyyy more). 

Why do men get so scared by this word?? Like fr that was the only reasoning he had when I tried to inquire why he felt like he had to manage my expectations and emotions barely a month into dating. Does that word have a deeper meaning that I’m not aware of? Because it’s really not that deep to me, but every man I tell it to does a complete 180 after I say it.

The men on this subreddit are always talking about how their confidence is being shattered on a regular basis, but I don't know what would be worse: honesty, politeness, or ghosting.

Women have 3 options when they are not interested in dating you:

1. Be honest and say something that probably hurts your feelings.
2. Say something like, ""It's not you, it's me.  I'm working on myself.  I'm not looking for a relationship right now.""  Vague but not hurtful.
3. Ghost you and just avoid the drama altogether.

55,s7axve,1642547827,Girlfriend keeps commenting on skin color…,"Hi everyone, I have a weird situation and am just looking for some objective opinions

Background: I (25M) started dating my girlfriend (25M) about 4 months ago. We met off tinder and clicked IMMEDIATELY.  we keep seeing each other and become exclusive.  However, she’s told me things about her past completely unsolicited, things I did not ask to know and very much did not want to know, things that I did not feel the relationship was ready for. (We had only been together a few weeks) Her past is her past and that’s fine but she would go in to TOO much detail, again unsolicited.  One of the things she mentioned is how she  exclusively dated black and brown men before me (I am white, so is she).  That’s no problem to me at all but I felt that she has a type and that I do not fit that type.

We have texted talked every day for hours since he'd ended things. We hang out around once a week. The dynamic between us really has not changed apart from the obvious (intimacy, the I love you's, etc.). He still makes time for me and we are growing closer emotionally.

Whenever I have mentioned getting back together, he has expressed fear and reluctance, which I understand: no one wants to step back into the same thing they stepped out of. He said he would be open to discussing it in the future when the issues are no longer issues. But, I am confident I can really work on myself to have less anxiety and better self-love!

We met at a Meetup event last week. I couldn't spend much time talking to her as I met her near the end of our meet, but we chatted for a short time and before we left, managed to get each other's Facebook. 

The next day she messages me on Facebook. She tells me it was nice to meet me and she gave me her number and told me it would be nice to hang out sometime. I responded also telling her I enjoyed meeting her and also told her I will text her later as I would definitely be interested in hanging out. She ""love"" reacted my messages.

The next evening I text her to greet her and she gets back to me the next morning. She responded, asked me how my weekend was going, we had a short chat, and she again asked me if I would be interested in meeting for drinks and dinner this week. I said yes and told her I'm down to meet with her and told her I have suggestions for places to go to. She replied back saying she'll let me know when she has time off this week from work and will get back to me for when she can meet up. I gave a quick reply and just left it at that for now. I don't want to seem to anxious or desperate (even if I really am) so I'm not spamming her with texts and am patiently waiting for her replies. She is a slow texter.

I've almost always been the one to ask a girl out and the amount of times I've been rejected is really depressing. But for once someone actually asked me out and I've become anxious in excitement.

63,s7c3to,1642550935,"Second date secured, more confused/scared than the first (Long)","I’m gonna go a bit ‘off my chest’ here since my friends are no help with stuff like this, so please bare with me:

Over the weekend I (22M) had my first date (not really sure date is the right word, we only referred to it as meeting up/hanging out) *ever* with a girl (22F) I met through OLD who I was talking to for at least 2 months prior. Dating was never a priority for me because of lots of issues with self worth, insecurities, generally being very anxious and shy, thus never done anything past talking to girls in a social context and being too chicken to make a move, ask for a number, or just flirt in general. However texting this girl was the first time things felt different (I’ve *meaningfully* matched with maybe 3 dozen girls in the last year total), I responded no differently than I would anyone else but we had no issue keeping a conversation flowing to the point where I miraculously felt comfortable enough to ask her out. We kept texting every day up until our date just sharing stuff going on day to day and general curiosities.

Anyway, before the date I was absolutely petrified, I could barely eat and get myself ready. I was so worried about A) me thinking this person is, or myself being, nothing like their profile/texts and me wasting both of our time or B) me doing/saying something dumb and ruining my chances with someone genuinely interested in me. Another thing I can’t wrap my head around, stemming from severe imposter syndrome with anything, I really struggle understanding why any stranger would want to know about me, spend time with me, care about me (besides my family or close friends of course). So I get to where we decide to meet and she had gotten there first so there goes any formal greeting out the window, I walk in and greet her with just a stupid “hey we made it” and pulled enough together to act like myself. We sit down and talk for ~2 hours, rarely a pause, lots of laughs, rehashing stories we told over text with more detail, learning more about each other. I tried my best to remember to smile/eye contact (things I’m just bad at regardless).

Here’s where my critical overthinking comes in. She talked a lot about her male friends, something very normal for her I guess, whereas all my close friends are dudes and I’ve never really had any close female friends, at least that I would talk to out of the blue or hang out with often. This just screams to me that the friend zone was not out of question. It doesn’t help that I was acting extremely cautiously/respectfully and didn’t even once think to compliment her or break the touch barrier, just brushing past each other as we walked. To be fair, she didn’t drop any compliments or wasn’t too forward with contact either. By the end she was abruptly in a hurry to leave even though we both mentioned we had nothing go on for the day. She had taken public transit to the place and I had driven. Considering we at least talked for 2 hours without any huge red flags being thrown, I offered to driver her back and she accepted no hesitation.

Commence the ‘holy fuck she’s in my car’, I fumble to play something on the aux and she directs me to her place and we just talk about music. We get to her place and she just jumps out and says “it was really nice finally meeting you” I return it and it was over. The whole rest of the day I was confused, she was an amazing person and more than I could ever ask for but the date felt so neutral, kicking myself for not being more forward, but thankful I also wasn’t and made a fool of myself. We’re radio silent the whole rest of the day. Midnight roles around and there’s zero chance I’m sleeping that night unless I text her. “Hey sorry for the late reply. I had a really good time today, wondering if you’d want to meet up again sometime”. Not really knowing what I wanted to hear but fully expecting something along the lines of “you were nice but I don’t see *us* happening”. Not long after I get a “Yes totally!!!”, W.T.F. What did I do?! Specifically what did I do *right*?! This put a massive smile on my face but it still didn’t stop me from not sleeping that night and literally re-rolling everything that went down that day.

Next day she’s texting me just like we had been prior to the date. The day after she adds me on snapchat (from my number) out of nowhere, I had made it clear I don’t really use any social media but something to consider regardless. I’m just at a total loss here. My critical overthinking is that I’ve just been thrown deep into the friend zone, yet we’ve only met once. I know some people like to take is slow and become friends before becoming more than friends so I have no idea how to read this situation as I don’t know even know what my preferential pace is. I know this second date has to mean something, we didn’t meet on a dating app to go out to dinner or whatever and make a friend who lives across the city so I know want and need to make moves. I then risk being too forward and messing things up is she wants to take it slow. For all I know that was her first date ever and she’s just as inexperienced and confused, and that’s not something we discussed and I wouldn’t a clue if it’s something she’d be comfortable discussing.

I have no idea what I’m specifically asking for here besides how do I not mess this up? This girl was cute, funny, respectful, we had more than enough shared interests and I’m already thinking of dozens of things to talk about with her but I don’t know how to make it more than just a conversation and into a relationship.

Might just because I haven’t been around enough places but I’ve only seen the exclusivity talk discussed in online forums like here. 

For reference I live in the US, more specifically a more liberal city in TX. Am also currently enrolled in a university so most my peers are young 20’s.

65,s7cd0w,1642551619,I think I’ve caught feelings for my fwb,"


TL;DR I think I’m starting to fall for my sneaky link/fwb.

So I (f20) started seeing this guy(m20)  from tinder, and I just went into it with it being a friends with benefit situation. 

In my previous experiences, I’ve been really good at not having any emotions involved whatsoever (no cuddling, going straight home after we do stuff, not texting often) because keeping it separate makes it easy and clear. However, there was something about him where he was super cuddly with me from the get go, and I didn’t mind it. I remember even the first few times after we had sex, he’d say “do you usually do this with other people?” (Cuddling). And I was honest with him and said no and he replied me neither. Fast forward 3/4 weeks later, we’ve been messaging each other almost everyday and have been meeting up but just to have sex, and we would also stay the night round each other’s, and have showers together. (Something I never do with a fwb)

It’s to the point now where I have admitted to myself that I have some form of feelings for him, as I’d usually be bored of whichever guy I’m seeing after a month, but somehow he still keeps me interested. I’m at a point now where I still want to keeping seeing him and having sex, but I’m tempted to ask if he sees this going anywhere, or if he wants to start hanging out outside of just having sex, but I’m worried that a) I’m saying something too soon and b) I’ll look desperate.

I was seeing a guy back in November we didn’t end up working out because he was playing a bunch of games. One night when he came over to my house, he took me out then slept over and left the next morning then he decided to not talk to me for 2 straight days after. I immediately stopped talking to him shortly after. So technically I ghosted him last because of the inconsistency. I don’t appreciate someone spending a night with me then not talking with me. He unfollowed me on social media “Instagram” after he had been liking my pictures for awhile. So I was a little humored by this sudden unfollow. Why go through liking my stuff then just unfollow. This was 2 months after the incident. Either way I don’t understand how someone could diss a person then like their pictures after. Maybe he feels guilty for what he did to me that’s why he unfollowed. This is why I hate dating I took a break after this loser. Attempt to get my attention? I’m not sure and I don’t care.

So far the guys my mom has mentioned are all South Asian, like don’t get me wrong I’m not saying they’re not attractive or anything. I think everyone is beautiful. But for some reason I myself can’t imagine living with one. 
I have talked to my sister about this and she told me that I’m not being realistic enough  and that I should come in terms with the fact that since I’m a south Asian I’ll most likely marry one too. 
Like I’m open to the idea of marrying someone outside my race, I think I’ll be more happier that way instead of marrying someone of my race. Whenever I see an interracial couple I think they look soo good and cute together, especially interracial babies/kids I think they look super cute, and sometimes I wish one day I could have an interracial kid too. 
Idk I just have thoughts like these and I feel like it’s very hard for me to explain to my family since they obviously want me to marry someone of my race, all of my cousins and siblings have married someone within the race. 
I thought of telling this to my parents before too but I feel like when I will tell them that I’m not attracted and want to marry someone outside my race, they’ll be like do I have someone I like and if I don’t I’ll have to marry someone from within the race if that makes sense. 

So I don’t know what to do that this point, like I’m abit confused. I can go along with my parent’s wishes and marry someone of my race but I don’t think I’ll be happy that way. 
Btw I know some ppl might comment that this has something to do with psychology or with child abuse or trauma or self hatred, And no this has nothing to do with it and is not the cause of this so yea just to put it out there.

69,s7dbdc,1642554265,Might she be interested?,"So yeah i just started a job at a governemental building as IT technician, i had to mount some desks for future workers and there's a beautiful girl in a row where i did work today and yesterday. She was quite, yeah, distracting, while i had to work near her i happened to be goofer than usual and burning with sweat cause i just find her attractive out of my control and she is much more beautiful than any other girls i happened to date, i would say, like, looking out of my class. I used to be shy with girls but i'm not really anymore and this happening was highely unusual(such random attraction had me think she could also maybe feel the same, as humans have pheromones too, just a guess though). So yeah, first day i didn't talk to her and just got nervous, might have catched some glares but didn't give to them so much attention at the moment. His name was written at her desk so i could search her on facebook and stalk  a little bit, i saw she was single, went at the same high school than me and was only some months younger. 

Today was the last day working in her row and since i found her attractive i wanted to do some moves before i lose the opportunity. I was observing more so i could catch anything and i did catch things. In fact i catched some glares and every time she would move her hair just after while she quickly turn her head. And while i was not catching her she looked deep dove in her work(i also did the same in between glares). When my job was done before dinner i went to eat but sat in the middle of the cafeteria while looking at door so i can see if she came. She indeed came and i tried to be inviting to her with slight glares and stuff. She sat at the closest table to me with one other of her colleagues but her back was turned. 

She talked with her and we didn't talk yet but she was sometimes watching in the back a little bit. I finished my dinner, left for a few mins to put away my lunchbox and then i decided to be brave and go talk to her at the table in the front so i can go talk to her directly hoping her colleague wouldn't be there but she was till there. I did it anyway and first asked : have i seen you at school(i was not really remembering but still asked for the sake an intro as i knew we went to the same school at the same time from her facebook), she obviously didn,t remember either since it was  7 years ago but she did ask me basic questions while i wasn't talking to keep the conversation going. 

She had an open posture and looked happy to talk with me, had slight smiles at moments but wasn,t clearly flirting and i wasn't that much either altough i might have  gave myself with my behaviour, my weird question and also i did say i wanted to talk to her earlier but didn,t want to disturb her in her work.

I got really worried and was afraid this was her saying the dreaded we should just be friends. But she specified she didn't want to break up and she likes me. We hugged and I feel better now. And we went out and got breakfast today and have seen each other outside of work. But not wanting to go on dates feels like a sign I think. If she wants to stay platonic that's cool I just want to know, otherwise I will keep thinking of her romantically because I like her so much.

Anyhow he told me in november while he was away that he gets attached so he can’t just have a physical relationship with me but doesn’t want to lose me. There is an age difference and i’m older and i think it freaks him out. He said he wanted to talk about things when he came home at christmas but we didn’t really have much of a talk and today i asked if he is ready to be part of my life yet or if it still scares him and he said “both actually” and then said he’s leaving again soon and won’t be back for a couple months when hockey is over. He doesn’t want to start the seriousness while he’s away… and he said he likes to keep me on my toes. He also said he cares about me and is sorry if it seems like he doesn’t. 

What is happening here lol someone give me insight into Sag man",dating,t5_2qhb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/s7du0n/sagittarius_man_said_he_likes_to_keep_me_on_my/
76,s7dxsv,1642556045,Post-third date anxiety?,"I've (29F) gone on three somewhat nontraditional dates, with this guy (35M), I've been talking to approx. 2 weeks. First date we went to dinner and drinks - I ended up staying over after dinner because I got sleepy after a movie and a few drinks back at his place. We got brunch again the next day. Third date was a day later(yesterday) we got takeout and watched a new HBO miniseries - again I stayed over and we got breakfast the next morning. We haven't been fully intimate yet but we've cuddled, kissed, touching, etc. but he was a lot less affectionate on date 3 because he said he had a tension headache before bed. Now it's the day after date 3...I left his place this morning, kissed goodbye and we made dinner plans for Friday. I sent him a thank you text at 3pm (it's been 5.5 hours) but no response. Am I just overthinking this and this guy is into me?

77,s7dynd,1642556115,Been kinda down about dating since my breakup. Not sure what else to do.,"
My ex broke up with me back in March. I was blindsided and was in a very low place for awhile, he didn’t treat me well in the end and it nearly broke me. I took the following months to focus on myself. I cut my hair, got back into the gym, started spending a lot more time with family and friends, talking my feelings out in therapy etc. I’ve not forgotten how he hurt me, but I’ve accepted it. 

I felt ready a few months back to try dating again. Since it had been awhile, I downloaded dating apps just as a start, would talk to men in bars and at the gym. I’ve been told I’m attractive, have good looking, well liked guys give me attention but nothing ever pans out. 

Most recently a guy who reached out to a mutual friend to show interest in me, the second I showed interest back he ghosted. I guess just mentally it’s starting to take a toll on me. I’ve been feeling like something is wrong with me and it’s killing the confidence I built back up.

78,s7e1xy,1642556379,Boyfriend didn’t get me a Christmas present and I’m still upset about it.,"We started dating since January 1 2021. Valentine’s Day he got me a thoughtful gift as I did for him. On my birthday in July he got me a gift but didn’t wrap it, just sort of left it on his bed, got undressed and went under the covers almost like he said “okay well there it is, time to nap”. On his birthday in November I got him a winter coat since I didn’t want him to freeze outside as he didn’t have one. 
Now for Christmas, he knew he was going to get something from me. One month before Christmas he asked me what I wanted but I never told him cause I never like telling people what I want, so I told him to ask my best friend to help him. A week before Christmas my best friend told me he asked her about what he should get me. On Christmas Eve I came over to his house and brought gifts not only for him, but for his mother, father and two brothers.And I went home empty handed. On Christmas day I came over again just to hang out, and his mom got me a gift that was well thought out, I saw an extra gift bag and asked him if it was from him. He said “no but yours is on the way” and he never brought it up again. This man lied to me. It’s been almost a month since Christmas and he still hasn’t updated me on it. I can’t tell if he’s being cheap or lazy but I was just so hurt that I put so much into his and family gifts and he just … didn’t bother with anything. Then on our one year anniversary (jan.1. 2022) he once again didn’t do shit. Didn’t plan for a dinner or dessert. I decided not to bother cause it’s always me planning things. I did however get him a thoughtful gift. I did have a talk with him about this a couple days after our anniversary and he acted very apologetic that he hurt me. And whatever, we dealt with it but I keep thinking in my head why did he lie about this Christmas gift? Surely I would know it’s a lie if nothing ever arrived. Is he hoping I might forget ? Why am I putting in so much effort in this relationship . I feel like I shouldn’t be trying as hard as I should. I think that with valentines coming up, whatever happens it could either make or break the relationship. 
My brain can’t seem to let this go. But let me be clear, I’m not the type to be spoiled wanting jewelry or designer bags, I just want some effort. I don’t know what to do.

Since the 2nd date she was very clear she wanted a relationship and told me she stopped using the app were we met. We had a talk about it and stated I was not interested on knowing her sexual history and I would like to avoid that topic as it seems irrelevant to me (as long as there’s no a STD around).

Last date we went out for drinks and she brought that topic and she started asking me about my dating history and I was kind of vague with my answers but it seemed more like she wanted to tell me about hers. She used to date older men (10-17 yrs older than her) and pointed how they are so experienced and confident, then at some point of the conversation she said she wanted to be a cougar or have an experience with a 20yrs younger guy when she gets in her 40’s. The rest of the night she asked me about what I want in a relationship and how our dates are going well and that stuff. At the end of the night she rejects to come over to my place. All of this discouraged me to continue dating her at all.

Should I talk to her about my thoughts and discuss or should I just run away? It seems pretty obvious to me that you don’t act in this way with someone you are looking for something serious.

I like how I look a lot and don’t feel like I’m lacking anything until I’m in the bedroom and my boyfriend doesn’t touch me. I don’t understand why someone would date me and not want to take off my clothes or get involved if they don’t like my type of look

I’ve dated a bit but usually they say they like me because I’m sweet, intelligent, pretty, and have a great personality and what I have to offer is more special than sex like my career, hobbies, being family oriented, etc. 

In the past I’ve tried to please my partners but they either make fun of my body (which I leave) or are just not interested in me sexually and say they don’t think of me that way. Like saying they aren’t interested in looking at me topless but that I’m nice. I know it’s kind of dumb, but I’d like the man I’m with to find me sexy too. I’ve never had a man touch my breasts or anything like that. 

Most women just exist and men want to look and them and touch them, I have to ask and get told about my personality. My confidence in general is good, but with sex I’m terrified now. I kept trying to go into things open minded and happy and content but I’m just afraid.

I’m tired of never being enough in this way but just great in every other way apparently. I just wish for once I could have a good emotional connection and have the man I’m with find my body appealing too. I’m tired of “the thought of you topless doesn’t cross my mind, I like you for other reasons like you’re pretty nice and smart” or “you’re not as visually good as other women but you’re so talented” I’m so tired of these moments I just wish for once someone would like me inside and out

I’m very pleased with my living situation. I own my place which is spacious and affordable for me, I’m in walking distance of the train to Grand Central, and I can otherwise get to anywhere in the northern half of the city within 30 minutes by car. Though I work in the city and love spending days there, I also love the respite of quieter nights, and I love my access north into the Hudson Valley too. I’ve grown accustomed to the ease and fun of weekend getaways and the like.

I’ve had decent luck with city dating - I always go to them and I’m happy to.l (mostly just Manhattan and Queens - Brooklyn is where the travel becomes a bit much). But I also know that my lack of being within 5-10 miles substantially reduces my match pool.

Would it be worth unloading this piece of real estate (and my car, and the space for many hobbies) and becoming a city renter solely for more dating matches? One of the challenges is that nothing in or close to Manhattan is within my price range / I’d either be relegated to the outer neighborhood of outer boroughs, or just barely getting by in the smallest studio apartment available. I also really enjoy the convenience and peace of mind of owning my place, where steep yearly rent increases aren’t a thing at all.

99,s7fw7m,1642561775,Did I overreact?,"For sake of brevity I'm only including the really important parts (pls bear with me)

So I matched with a guy on a dating app. He's out in Malibu and I'm in West Hollywood. Usually with traffic thats a \~1 hour drive.

On his first attempt at a ""date"" he tells me he'll be in town for something, but that he may be free if I'm around afterwards. I told him sure, let me know. I don't hear anything until 2 am when he texts me asking me to come to this house party in the hills that he is at.

Few days later he texts me saying he may be in town for something. A little irritated at this point, I just say, ""Have fun."" He didn't respond until the next day saying he didn't come into town. At this point I'm like listen you don't seem so Interested, he apologizes and says he's just preoccupied.

The next day he asks if I'm free that night. I say I am after 7 pm. He says great. I text him at 7 pm asking what the plan is and he says why don't you come over I'm feeling lazy tonight. I say no, Ive never met you. He says understandable, sorry if I wasn't so tired I'd drive into town. He says we can ""maybe go out"" but that it's hard to get Ubers out of Malibu at night time. I say I don't wanna get stranded, maybe another time.

At this point, I probably should've just nipped it in the bud and just told him peace out but I didn't.

Final straw was a few days ago when he said he would be in town for a dinner, and asked what I was up to later. I asked when ""later"" was and he didn't text me until he finished dinner saying he was gonna stop by a friends house but would be free after. Very shortly after ""Actually I'm not stopping by a friends, where are you?"" At this point I'm like ""I'm home and staying home. I'm down for spontaneity but you seem to only ever want to meet when it's convenient for you. Hope you have a good night.""

At this point I was done, like completely turned off by his behavior and had no point in continuing whatever it was we had going on. He texted 3 times over the course of 4 days. The initial message was saying that he is willing to make plans when it wasn't convenient for him, second asking if I want to make plans, and third saying ""So no?""

I'm kind of a believer in just saying my piece and moving on but I felt compelled to tell him I'm seriously not interested anymore because I found his behavior to be wildly disrespectful. He sent a long message starting with ""I'm confused"" and I just couldn't be bothered to read the rest of it but his seemingly genuine confusion at what I was getting out made me doubt my feelings on this.
