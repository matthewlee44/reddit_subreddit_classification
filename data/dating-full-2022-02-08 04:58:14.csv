Both in our early 20s.  Never been in a relationship or loved a guy.
He’s never explicitly asked “will you be my girl?” &amp; I’ve never asked him to be my man. 

It was clear I wanted that but I’ve always lacked in my communication skills because I need time to process things. He’s the opposite he’s a quick thinker, he has a better memory than I do. &amp; that’s where I’m usually lacking.

He doesn’t bring much emotion into arguments/when confronting me about something &amp; he told me not to do the same. 
He usually just has his voice raised a bit most of the time. He said when talking about something serious you need to speak from facts not emotion, be serious. Of course I see this as a tactic to help me with my communication. But🤷🏽‍♀️

My problem is I rarely say what’s on my mind with him &amp; he often says we haven’t developed because I don’t open my mouth about stuff. That is true on my end. I’m always nervous like he’s a 1st time crush. I’m often scared to act on things. I am a very reserved &amp; most times quiet person. I don’t like confrontation but I wanna improve.

Idk what we are, I assumed: two people still in talking stage until I’m consistent with effective communication. He says he doesn’t do titles. He said relationships should be private. He said, in a similar form: “when two people know how they feel eachother they don’t need no title”. He tells me I am so worried about a title, the media. When I just like to take and post hella pics of me or other things because I love saving and sharing my memories so much..

I asked him recently, “are we in a relationship” He said, “You just need to focus on being consistent with the simplistic things I ask of you, which isn’t much.” 

Things like: speaking on how I feel, not rolling my eyes anymore, telling him when I plan on calling back, etc. When I do try to be consistent with these things I don’t feel like he’s also pulling thru so I stop

I feel like I messed up by adapting to letting him all in my time by getting on the phone every single day. Cause when I try to take my own personal time I’m most times guilt tripped for it because I don’t really inform over the phone or always ahead of time I just take the time &amp; acknowledge it later because I don’t feel obliged to him. 
In diff convos he’ll say things like “if you wanna leave (from him) then go” 

He’s definitely just made me feel like we’ve been together almost 3 years now this whole time and I thought I’ve been single. But honestly I still believe that, but I am so tied to him now. &amp; I genuinely don’t have interest for anyone else. He knows I don’t interact with many people and we’re present for most of each others days on FT. 

I sometimes feel like this is a trauma bond. I’m starting to grow feelings that my mind is confusing with love and I’m scared of learning it incorrectly from him.

Not being long distance would help my communication as I’d be forced to adapt to face to face verbal interaction.

not sure if this is the right sub to post on 

so the other night my sisters and I threw a moderately big house party while my mom was out of town. we invited only friends/people we knew but there were about 20 people there. 
my good friend Anna (F23) is dating my other good friend Danny (M19). they have been roommates for a couple months and decided to be friends with benefits. 

for a little context, they had a good friendship while still seeing/fucking other people. 
a few months ago Anna slept with Danny’s brother but didn’t tell anyone. after awhile the guilt ate her up and she decided to come clean to Danny. Danny was upset of course but since they weren’t together it didn’t completely hinder the relationship. few months later Danny &amp; Anna decided to become more than FWB and start talking but not officially together. after that Danny ended up sleeping with a close friend in our friend group but again not telling anyone. in a heated argument Danny confessed he fucked the friend and Anna was upset but they still worked through it. 

now they are officially dating and while at the party Danny got upset at Anna for “flirting” with someone else. after that Danny left (the party was dying down and people were starting to go to sleep) and Anna was spending the night. Anna was upset after he left and started talking to one of my close friends i’ve known all throughout high school. he is known to be pretty persistent and horny in situations but nevertheless they laid down together and one thing let to another, also the sex only lasted like 4 minutes if that matters. the next morning Anna confessed to us and felt very guilty and regretted it and stated she was just really upset in the moment and he was just there. she says she’s not the cheating type and she’s never done this before but doesn’t know if she should take this to the grave or confess. their relationship is rocky and quite toxic, and since Danny is so much younger he is quite immature. Anna also plans to move out of the apartment soon and says the only reason she kinda got with him is because they live together. she does like him but the question is is the relationship worth salvaging or just letting it go?",True,False,False,dating,t5_2qhb1,1157892,public,self,close friend cheated on another,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/snc3j4/close_friend_cheated_on_another/,no_ads,0,,,

I tried different angles but still look like Ikkaku from Bleach. Am I supposed to put crimson marks above my eyes? Joke.

How am I suppose to take photos to be used for dating websites? Young ladies are not attracted to bald guys.

I’m 26, she’s 22. It’s kind of a new dynamic for me - I’ve always been the same age as my partner. But anyways, we’ve gone on two dates. They’ve both been 6-8 hours in length. We just hang out, get drinks, window shop, etc. Its been really fun. It feels like there’s some potential in this and I don’t want to be stupid. For the first time I’ve played it all very cool. I’m a lot smarter and a lot less impulsive in my mid 20s than early. 

My problem is I can’t really read what’s next. She’s very anti-touch for instance (until she warms up, which she’s said takes a bit). Totally fine with that - boundaries are important and I’m happy that was communicated. She’s also admittedly said she’s not great at picking up social cues. Again, that’s fine. But it makes kind of navigating next steps hard. I’ve always followed a feeling, but it seems she may require some extra communication before proceeding. Like, I wouldn’t kiss her unprompted - but I don’t know how to ask someone to kiss. It feels weird to me. About date 2 or 3, I guess that’s when I normally would. She’s noted it’s maybe due to an undiagnosed social disorder or something, and again, I want to be respectful of that, but I guess I’m confused on how to make sure this isn’t a friendship thing. 

For our next date, I was just going to invite her over. Takeout, movie, etc. Maybe do a drink beforehand. And I won’t do anything at my apartment obviously. That’s not a plan. But after Date 3, it just feels like I’m not sure how to kind of start seeing if she wants to be a couple? Maybe it doesn’t go that far - I just feel good about her and want to do this the right way. The touch thing isn’t the end of the world - especially since she’s said she opens up eventually, but in the meantime, how do I establish starting to want to kick this up a little? Not a lot. But, more than just drinks and window shopping….kind of just doing the very next step of being more couple-ish or something. Just a way to establish I’m having fun, let’s reach the next level after 2-3 good dates.

Of course, I can be getting ahead of myself. Could end tomorrow outta nowhere.

I really started to develop some feelings for her and I felt like things were moving in a good direction. I kept things casual for the first couple times we saw eachother just to get to know her better and for her to be comfortable around me.

We were hanging out in her dorm watching TV and I asked if it would be okay if I put my arm around her. The reason I didn't just go for it was because I don't feel comfortable touching someone for the first time without verbal consent and I wanted her to feel comfortable that's just me though. That is when she told me she was talking to someone and I was just filled with dissapointment. I still told her that I really liked her, I genuinely enjoy spending time with her, and I thought she was a really pretty girl which I think made her really happy. She told me she thought I was really cool and enjoyed hanging out with me and I told her i would be fine continuing our relationship as friends and that was that. It wasn't awkward after I told her and we continued like normal. I still text her and chat with her a little bit almost everyday and we still make plans to hangout, however I still think that she is soooo adorable, and I can't help just loving talking to her and being around her.

The only man I’ve dated who I didn’t meet on an app I met at a friend’s BBQ and pursued him/asked him out myself and we dated for a while. I have no issue doing this, I’m not shy, but it’s very rare I meet a guy I’d want to approach. Plenty of men do approach me but I’ve never been interested in the ones who do. It’s usually old guys and fratty gym bros that call me shawty. So, absolutely everything is from the apps besides the one guy I pursued. 

But I hate dating now. I hate the apps. I feel like it’s become more and more sex-focused, even though I just use Bumble and Hinge now. I’ve had so many bad experiences. I’ve been on so many bad dates. I’ve had so many guys use me for sex. I’m just over it. 

I also feel like guys on apps always assume I’m way more into them than I am, like me swiping yes doesn’t mean “OMG you’re so hot, f*ck me right here,” it means your looks haven’t eliminated you yet… it means I want to talk and get to know you more as a person…🤦🏼‍♀️ I identify as demisexual and it makes me so uncomfortable how so many men just go straight to being super sexual, or how so many will pretend they want more for months at a time when they don’t.

I just feel so disposable to all these men. And yet I know I’m a total babe and catch. I don’t like how it makes me feel.

The more I look back on our relationship I wonder if I was being abused and/or manipulated by her during our relationship. It’s tough for me to distinguish what is my fault and what is her fault. I am very hard on myself and will blame myself for things that may not be my fault or are beyond my control. (My coworkers have had to talk me down when I was kicking myself over a small mistake I made at work and told me not to sweat it)

Some things I’m unsure about if it was abuse/manipulation or my fault:

• She got upset and defensive when I asked her not to post a picture of us with alcohol in our hands. We had posed with the drinks, so the fact that we were drinking was the primary focus of the picture. I was worried about what potential employers would think as I was looking for a job. My dad is also a recovering alcoholic which I never felt comfortable sharing with her. 

• She got very angry that I was playing Xbox with my friends at night during the 2020 COVID summer. She said she felt neglected but also got upset if I didn’t answer her text immediately which was a “test” to see if I would look at it right away or wait until I had a stoping point in my game. 

• When I first graduated college and was looking for a day job. She got mad at me being home so much (I had a part time roll working nights and weekends) and wanted me to print out my resume and drive to offices despite me telling her the roles I was looking for were only doing online applications. 

• I drove a 2003 car and she always made backhand comments anytime I would get something worked on (even regular oil changes) saying I shouldn’t spend money on it and just buy a new one when I nor my parents could afford it. 

• She would make comments about foods being high in sodium or how things containing butter and cheese were fattening.

• she would get pissed off when I wouldn’t work out with her. When I did if I said I didn’t want to do something or if I pushed back when she tried to get me to redo a bad push-up or whatever she’d lose her mind. 

• we went on a trip to Disney with her parents. Got upset when I told her I wouldn’t be ready to leave at 7 or whenever they wanted to pickup me up on the travel day. That morning she did hit my shoulder and kick my suit case when she was angry with me. Also on that trip she would get angry anytime I wanted to do something that wasn’t in line with what she wanted to do. (Like going back to the room if I was tired, or wanting to sleep some and not be at the park at opening after leaving at 1am the previous night.)

• her and my parents didn’t get along. She would get angry when I talked to them and would say things like “I don’t know how you can talk to them”. She had drama between them but wouldn’t allow me to tell them. Then would complain it was my job to fix the issues between her and them. 

• we had some drama happen on a beach trip with my family and she held a grudge  

• we were both Christian’s but tried to say the denomination I grew up on wasn’t the correct way by poking holes in some of the beliefs. She said my infant sprinkling wasn’t good enough. I started going to her church and wound up getting baptized under her denomination. I felt good about it then but now I feel unsure about it and am not sure where I am with my faith.

• refused to go to therapy to resolve the issues between myself, her and my parents 

• she didn’t like that physical touch was my love language and got irritated when I wanted a to hug or cuddle and she wasn’t in the mood. 

• could be easily irritated over little things and I believe this is why I have self confidence issues and am not always comfortable in my own skin. 

Obviously this list doesn’t contain my faults or wrong doings. She could be a sweet girl when she wanted. To give some background on her: she’s an only child and went to school for nursing. She wanted to be a teacher to have summers off but that didn’t pay enough. So nursing would give her 4 day weekends. She also started seeing someone less than a month after we broke up.

There’s absolutely no point caring about dating or losing your V-card. The more you care, the more **anxious** and lonely you’re gonna feel.

If your friends around you talk about your virginity status, then tell them it’s none of their business and it’s weird for them to even care about it (usually people don’t care) 

Online Dating for the most, sucks. For everyone. It’s shallow in every way possible, because even on apps like Bumble, the first thing anyone looks at is your profile pics / physical appearance. 

There’s always gonna be competition, there’s always going to be the ‘top dogs’ on the app that are getting hundreds of matches a day, while you’re struggling to even get 1 in a whole month. 

There’s no point caring about dating. Whether you’re in your 20’s or 40’s. 
You build your life the way you want it to be, and focus on being happy, no other person is going to make you happy, and when they leave, you wouldn’t want to break down, you are the one that matters in *your* life.

So you want a girl.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You download bumble, put up a few photos your sister clicked at the party yesterday, even throw in some with pets.

&amp;#x200B;

You fill all the details just to get that profile meter as close to 100% as possible, cuz who doesn't want more matches?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now you wait.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And you actually get a match!

Great! But you want options. So you wait.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You wait

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

...wait...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You get desperate for the notification saying ""There's a new bee in your hive""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

and then there were none.

Sound familiar?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have faced this along with several of my friends.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You meticulously build out your profile but never get to know if it's you or the bumble algorithm playing psychological tricks with you.

I kind of wanted to take things slow so i wanted to start off as friends. The night i met her i got her number and we talked for like an hour i end up falling asleep on her. i then end up leaving her on read the next morning (she didnt say anyting i could respond to which is why) my plan was to text her later on that day, i ended up getting busy and dint get the chance too. For 2 days actually. Legit was busy. I texted her on the thrid day, ans she leaves me on read. I admit i was wrong for kind of ignoring her. to be fair she had a family member pass the same night i met her and thanksgiving was the next day. (This is all in a span of 3 days) i felt it was right to let her mourn for a few days and enjoy her holiday. ( ik i shouldve wished her a happy thanksgiving or something) Im guessing she took it the wrong way and thought i wasnt intersted. (I totally understand but were not my intentions) Me thinking i left her on seen a few days before i thought okay thats probably why i was left on read. Keep in mind im not doing so well so i took advantage and used this as an excuse to ghost her for 2 weeks. I text her again, she leaves me on read. Now im being petty and i get my pride involved, i end ghosting her for a month. 
At this point i think maybe i ruined the relationship so i delete her.
 but i swear i just dont have experience on relationships and to make it worse i was 18...grown) she adds me back 3 months later and i end up ignoring her message and request for 3 days ( she knew i got the message but i was still being petty, i reply, she doenst read it for a week, we end up not talking for the rest of the year 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️. fast foward to around thanksgiving she would watch my stories within seconds. I try to text her, i get left on read. i tried texting her once a week for a month, i get left on read.

Im not gonna lie im fucking confused but all this all my fault. i have a lot of pride and i never got over her its just my life has been shit and i dont see it working but at the same time i want it to and i cant seem to let her go, i just cant considering how shitty i treated her i want to make things right but im super antisocial and dont know how to go about it.

A girl (around 25 y/o) that I was interested in, was passing by. I said hello, introduced myself and we talked about our day. She was very friendly and receptive. 

&amp;#x200B;

A day or two later, I found her account on Instagram and I started to follow her. She then messaged me first. Since then we've been messaging on and off, for about 2 weeks. We shared a few jokes, talked about our days at work, and how our weekends were going. We also talked a bit about what she likes to do for fun. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got the vibe that she liked me and I liked her, so I sent her a message this afternoon, asking her out. But the reply I got was weird. It started off sort of standard, in a positive way. She sent the 😊 emoji. But then asked very direction questions: ""Whats going on ?"" ""Who's with us ?"" ""Where about ?"" and then I got ""You know I have a boyfriend yeah ?"". 

&amp;#x200B;

That last message was unexpected. Especially as, she's never mentioned a boyfriend before and there's no photos of her with a guy, at least within the last 3 months. The messages also felt kind of off. She normally doesn't leave a space before the ? at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

I replied with ""haha sorry, I didn't know."" 

The reply I got was ""It’s alright **she didn’t tell you** . It’s fine it’s not your fault "". 

That's when I realised, who am I talking to? Why am I getting a message that sounds like its from someone else.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do... I haven't messaged the account since, as I strongly feel like someone else was replying to the last few messages.

I don't want to date her if she has a boyfriend. But now I want to ask her in person was someone else on her phone. 

&amp;#x200B;

But is that a bad idea?

Fast forward to now, we’ve been on a lot of dates together and spent New Years together but we are still just “talking.”

He had planned for us to go to a sports game this weekend but it got canceled so I asked him what else were we gonna do for that day instead since Valentines Day is coming up and we probably won’t see each other on the actual day since we live in different cities.

His response is that it was just another day for him and honestly that hurt my feelings. That mixed with the “no title” status is making me feel like I’m wasting my time. He told me he wasn’t seeing anyone else but I just feel like I’m “some girl.”

I told him that I’m confused about what we are and I don’t wanna be talking forever and his response was he’s trying to figure it out.

If you are taking this long to decide whether you want to be with me then maybe we aren’t meant to be. My expectation is I want to be in a relationship. I’m in my mid twenties and I wanna be done with just dating.

Fair concern, but we resolved that and made a point that we are all still friends. I don't do PDA in front of friends solely to avoid them feeling this way.

I feel like I've just lost life's lottery to be honest. Last night I just sat in the pub and all around me were couples. Why can't I have that? Why was I born ugly on the inside and out? Its not like I haven't tried.

I'm not a inc*l about it. Its 100% my own fault but I just dk what I'm doing wrong. I was born ugly inside and out like I said, but I must be doing something else wrong surely. I guess a certain percentage just have to be the losers in life.

I tried talking to my friend about it and he basically told me to shut the fuck up and he has his own problems to deal with and doesn't need my virginous bullshit.

Which is fair enough tbh. It's just I don't really have anyone else to talk about this with. My family basically bullies me for it and I just feel sad if I don't try and vent. I honestly feel bad for trying to talk to him about it. He doesn't deserve it.

My friend gets a match every other swipe and complains about it. She said she just doesn’t like it as it’s “too much”. This was right before she watched me swipe right on through 142 profiles without resulting in a single match. My tinder analysis data was abysmal also. She laughed at me because of how low my match rate is.

Hopefully some of you can relate.

I met a guy on Tinder. We talked a little before he asked me out on a coffee date. I said yes. He wasn't the most handsome person in the world, I don't think he's even my type, but I felt attracted to him almost immediately. He seemed a bit shy, a bit excited and we had A LOT of common interests. The evening was very nice and at the end of our meeting he asked two times if I'll be willing to se him again soon. I said sure and I wasn't lying.

...so I asked him out on a second date, he seemed excited. We went to grab another coffee. The conversation was deeper this time and I genuinely started to like him as a person. And then BAM - he said he feels like now he needs to take care of himself first. That he's not in a place he wants to be. He just lost his job, he feels emotionally  exhaused after his last relationship and he doesn't want to be in a relationship right now and it's not something he's looking for. I was like, oh crap, he want's to fuck me and then melt into a stardust. I told him that I am open to the idea of the relationship or friendship if I really like someone, but I'm not into hookups or casual sex at all. He then said that he does not look for sex, because he hates to treat people like an object to serve him. He just sometimes feel lonely and he wanted to meet some friends. That he wouldn't meet me in real life and he just wants to see how things go. Also, he found out that Tinder is just not for him, but he do not regret being there because we met. I felt like he really wanted to reassure me that he wants to continue to getting to know me, so I was like sure, let's be friends.

But at the end of our meeting we hugged. I wanted to air kiss his cheek, like the last time, but he just kissed me in my mouth. Passionately. I lost my brain for a moment. It wasn't something I expected. Anyway, we went to our homes and now he keeps reacting to my stories and shit and I don't know how to feel about him. 

I HATE assuming that people around me are trying to use me in some way. I prefer to give them a benefit of the doubt, but I don't know if that's naive of me or what.

So maybe I give some context about me first. I'm 24 yo (F) and I'm usually discribed as a loving, intelligent and loyal, unjudgemental person (if anyone prefers MBTI types more for description, I'm an INFJ) I'm very romantic and love people who have an interesting aura on them. I don't really care about apperancem..I value things that come from someones heart more then materialistic things. In my freetime I usually enjoy reading, watching anime and doing digital art.

I never really had a boyfriend, especially because in my school years (im not american so idk the classes but between 13-17 yo) i didn't looked good. I was the skinny awkward lookin girl with glasses and braces who boys usually made fun of, i know it sounds cliché but it really was like this. I wish it wasnt like this believe me, it was hell. So even if I had a crush on someone, I was made fun of or i just kept quiet cuz I knew I had no chance. Fast forward to now, I got more confident in my apperance and I would consider myself very pretty. All of my former school camerades usually don't recognize me anymore. (and im proud to be able to have the courage to say that I get many compliments about my apperance, sometimes I cant even understand it since I always got bullied for how I looked.) 

So the last few years I tried to go and be a lil more active in the dating world. Since I live in a small village, I usually do onlinedating. I'm ok with that cuz I'm way too shy to go on a date after 2 days of texting anyways. So I really am searching for someone kind and witty. And everytime, the same thing happens:

When I really care about someone, I show them all my love. I love sharing and make them feel loved and cared for. It's just who I am. But usually I dont get  the same treatment back. And I usually get taken for granted. I rarely say anything about it and just try even harder, because I dont wanna loose them, but deep down it really hurts my heart. Sometimes I wonder how it would feel like being on the recieving side. It's become already that bad, that I usually can't even picture someone really loving me unconditionally. Or someone just giving me flowers because they thought if me. Or anything. It always feels so onesided and I don't know what I am doing wrong. 

Some people say I should be more passive and play hard to get. Or leaving them on read so they see when I'm not there what they are missing out or whatever. But.. I hate playing mindgames, I want to show how genuine I love someone and I want to be real. Why should I play hard to get when I dearly am in love with someone? Shouldn't showing love do the trick by itself?? But even If I decide to do it, usually I just get forgotten. I was never to someone important enough so that type of thing would've worked. They just forget me or doesnt even realize I stopped texting. It was one incident lately where I send someone a box of very cute things for valentines day. (A loving 1 page letter written in Korean by me, Pictures, chocolate, stuff that had a history for us and some souveniers- hes korean so I thought it would be nice to send him some cute things from here). But he just left me on read for 3 days and after i asked again he said just thank you and your gift will come then too. I was heartbroken cuz I didnt send the gift as an intention to getting something too.. and this is just one of the incidents


I just don't know what I'm doing wrong. Is being genuine and real not the way someone should act when being in love?

She told me she thought we were doing stuff behind her back which i reassured her nothing was going on.

But it continued. It started to really drain me and make me feel like my feelings were a burden and that it would ruin everything. So i confronted my bff telling her that if shes so worried that things would happen, she needs to talk to the other mutual and express that, cause i cant control the other persons actions. She never did.
It felt like she didnt trust me anymore.

She later admitted to me she lost trust in me, feels sorry for hurting me but doesnt regret it, and me telling her my feelings for the mutual friend put a burden on her.

I later decided to cut things off, telling her that our dynamic isnt working anymore and that im hurting and need time away.

Then she decided to blame me saying i was a shitty friend, that she doesnt wake up and think about my problems, say i faked my interests to get closer to the mutual (???) and that we are over.

A few months ago, she visited NY (she has a lot of friends here, visit was not just for me) and it was fun, things were kind of how they were when they were dating. She is now in NY again and when I saw her things felt...different. 

I still love her just as much and want to spend time with her and feel and be close with her, I still view her as my confidante and someone I trust, but I didn't feel enamored or as romantically toward her as I did the first visit and ultimately didn't feel like I wanted to sleep with her. I'm not sure what changed because I love her just as much as I did, and I'm still attracted to her, it just feels like too much I guess to fall back in to where we were.

Anyway, she's understandably hurt and I don't blame her, I just wish I could understand my feelings better so I could talk them through with her. I'm at the point where maybe my feelings will even change, I don't know!

In between dates, communication is very limited which I sort of understand since he’s busy with work.

For me (and most of my other dates), unless the last text is one word or an emoji I would always respond to at least acknowledge whatever the text is. But he doesn’t. Even when my last text is a question he would not respond… and a few days later he would text something completely unrelated. Is he not that interested/doesn’t care that much, or am I overthinking this?

There’s also a lack of verbal affirmation. Unlike others I’ve met, he doesn’t tell me explicitly if he’s enjoyed spending time with me or he wants to see me again. I’m not even sure if he wants to hangout again until he reaches out (or I reach out). Even when he reaches out, I’m not sure if it’s because I’m convenient - since we live close by and I happen to be free for the day he wants to hang out. I might be overthinking it but I’m an open book and usually just say what’s on my mind, so it’s harder for me to read/understand when the other party doesn’t state their thoughts/feelings clearly.
